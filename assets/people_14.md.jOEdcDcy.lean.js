He is currently Assistant Manager at Bridlington Town. Career =Derby County= Ashbee began his career at Derby County in 1994. He stayed at the Rams for two seasons, but struggled to make an impact and after a loan spell, he was eventually sold to Cambridge United in 1996. =Cambridge United= Ashbee was one of Cambridge United's longest-serving players at the time. He made his debut in a 1–0 win at Torquay. It was here that Ashbee made his name as he scored 11 goals in over 200 games for The U's. =Hull City= Purchased by manager Jan Mølby in June 2002 in the Third Division he suffered a nightmare start to his Hull career as he was sent off on his debut. This was, however, due to his no-nonsense approach on the pitch and he soon became a firm favourite with Tigers fans and management alike, with both Mølby and Peter Taylor making him captain. The goal he scored against Yeovil Town was the goal that promoted Hull to League One and he was also instrumental in Hull's successful promotion campaign to the Football League Championship in the following season. Ashbee was, however, cursed by an old injury in the subsequent Championship campaign, being diagnosed with an osteochondral defect, a degenerative bone condition in his femur. He underwent surgery that involved drilling fourteen holes in the bone to stimulate re-growth. He was warned by his doctor that this injury threatened not just his career, but his ability to even walk. Ashbee was on crutches for four months and was ruled out for the majority of the 2005–06 season, nevertheless he remained a favourite amongst many Tigers fans, receiving a standing ovation at the last game of the season against Watford despite being sidelined. He was also retained as captain by Hull's next manager, Phil Parkinson, and his replacement, Phil Brown. But with a poor team performance in their second season in the Championship, finishing just one place outside the relegation zone, Ashbee as captain received a large share of fans' criticisms that were aimed at the team, despite the outgoing chairman Adam Pearson suggesting him as a potential Player of the Season. The 2007–08 season saw vastly improved performances from the team as a whole, culminating in the club reaching its first ever Wembley Stadium final, taking on Bristol City for a place in the Premier League, a game which they won 1–0. This meant that Ashbee captained Hull to promotion from the bottom division of the Football League to the top. Andy Dawson, Boaz Myhill and Ryan France are the other players to have helped take Hull up through the four divisions.tribalfootball.com – Hull's Dawson happy joining brother Michael in Premiership On 16 August 2008 Ashbee was captain of the Hull side that won its first ever top-flight game 2–1 against Fulham, completing an achievement thought to be unique in English football: captaining the same team in all four divisions of the Football League, bottom to top. Towards the end of the 2008–09 season, in a fixture against Aston Villa on 4 May 2009, Ashbee suffered another career-threatening injury, rupturing a posterior cruciate ligament in his knee. It was initially thought that he would return to action in the Autumn, however on 18 August it was reported that Ashbee required further surgery on the knee and would likely miss the entire 2009–10 season. Upon his return on the first game of the 2010–11 season, Ashbee scored the second goal in Hull 's 2–0 victory over Swansea City. =Preston North End= In January 2011, Ashbee signed for Preston North End, managed by former Hull manager Phil Brown, after handing in a transfer request to then Hull City manager Nigel Pearson. Ashbee was offered a 1-year contract extension at Hull, but wanted to sign a 2-year contract, which Preston offered him. He went on to make 19 appearances for Preston during the season, but could not prevent his club from being relegated. Ashbee was named club captain of Preston in June 2011. On 2 February 2012, Preston and Ashbee agreed to end his contract. During that season, at the age of 35, he had struggled through a knee injury that restricted him to only seven starts and four substitute appearances. =Retirement= Ashbee stated on his Twitter page later in 2012 that he had retired from professional football at the age of 36. On 13 January 2015, he came out of retirement by signing for a short time with Humber Premier League side Hull United. =Management= On 20 September 2016 Ian Ashbee was announced as the assistant manager to Curtis Woodhouse at Bridlington Town. =Jewellery= In 2013 Ian Ashbee began working for Blowers Jewellers as Director of Sports Clients.

Design and development The JL-10 is an advanced trainer aircraft developed by Nanchang based Hongdu Aviation Industry Corporation. The aircraft made its maiden flight on 13 March 2006. The aircraft's general designer is Mr. Zhang Hong (), and development had reportedly been completed alongside Yakovlev OKB of Russia. The JL-10 is a direct rival to the Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle in competition for the People's Liberation Army Air Force's (PLAAF) next- generation advanced trainer aircraft program. HAIG unveiled a full-scale mock- up of its early prototype the L-15 advanced lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT) in the 2004 Zhuhai Airshow. The two-seat, two-engine L-15 featured the latest advanced technologies developed by China, such as the digital quadruple fly- by-wire (FBW), glass cockpit (two multi-color head down displays for both the front and rear cockpit, and an additional head-up display for the front cockpit) and hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) flight control. The look-down field of view for the front cockpit is 18°, and 6° for the rear cockpit, exceeding the US requirement. The aerodynamic performance of the aircraft is enhanced by its large leading edge extensions (LEX) design, which gives a maximum angle of attack of 30°. This is very useful when trying to simulate the maneuvers of advanced fourth-generation fighters such as J-10, JF-17 and J-11, as well as for newest fifth generation fighter like J-20 and J-31. JL-9/FTC-2000 Mountain Eagle trainer jet from Guizhou Aircraft Industry Corporation (GAIC) is a direct competitor of the JL-10. JL-10 has a wide range of more advanced features comparing JL-9, but JL-9 is significant cheaper and its development and production would be fully indigenous, while early batches of JL-10 still rely on AI-222 series turbofan engine from Ukraine before an indigenous update is ready. With the JL-10, student pilots will be able to complete mission flight training and advanced combat training, as well as complete all basic jet flight training courses. The aircraft also has six (four under-wing and two wingtip) pylons to carry various air-to-air and air- to-ground weapons. If necessary, it can serve in the lightweight attack role with minor modifications, carrying up to 3.5 tons of armament. Each of the first two units (#01 & #02) are powered by two Ivchenko-Progress DV-2 engines, which do not have afterburners, and these two aircraft thus do not have the capability to reach supersonic speed. The third unit (#03) is powered by a pair of an improved version of the DV-2, the DV-2F, that has afterburners, so that it can attain supersonic speed. The subsequent production units are expected to be powered by Ukraine's Ivchenko-Progress AI-222K-25F turbofan engines with afterburners once a co-production license is obtained by the 608 Institute. Ivchenko-Progress was able to increase the thrust of the AI-222-28F (thrust 4500 kg afterburning) and AI-222-30F (5000 kg thrust afterburning) engines. The latter two engines may be used to equip the JL-10 or other Chinese aircraft. Meanwhile, according to various Chinese reports, JL-10s with updated Guizhou FWS-17 engines had already undergone test flights. In June 2013, the AJT condition of L-15 finalized the design and would be operated by PLAAF with a formal name JL-10. On July 1, 2013, the first batch of JL-10 began delivery to the PLAAF. Chinese Air Force and later Naval Air Force are highly satisfied with the aircraft's all-around performance, high reliability, cost-effectiveness, as well as its great multi-role update potentials, easy maintainability, and a service life of over 10,000 flying hours.

The Upper Newport Bay (known to locals as \\"The Back Bay\\") is a large coastal wetland (an estuary) in Newport Beach, Southern California and a major stopover for birds on the Pacific Flyway. Dozens of species, including endangered ones, can be observed here. Upper Newport Bay Nature Preserve and Ecological Reserve represent approximately 1,000 acres (4 km2) of open space. The Upper Newport Bay was purchased by the state in 1975 for its Fish and Wildlife Department's Ecological Reserve System. In 1985 the upper west bluffs and lands surrounding the bay became part of an Orange County regional park, which offers outdoor activities such as bird-watching, jogging, bicycling, hiking, and kayaking. The Peter and Mary Muth Interpretive Center, located at 2301 University Drive, is open to the public Tuesday through Sunday from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. An organization known as the Newport Bay Conservancy (NBC) provides volunteers to answer visitors' questions and guide them through the various activities. The bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California (1974) State of California The main tributary of the Upper Newport Bay is San Diego Creek, which flows past the San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary before entering the bay.

The present settlement of Schönau grew up round the monastery. By the end of the 12th century Schönau was already in use as a burial place of the Staufen family: in 1195 Conrad of Hohenstaufen, Count Palatine of the Rhine, was buried here, as were his son of the same name, probably in 1186, and both his wives. Adolf, Count Palatine of the Rhine (d. 1327), Rupert II, Elector Palatine (d. 1398) and other members of the family were also buried here. Conrad II, Bishop of Hildesheim, died here and was presumably also buried here. In the 14th century Schönau was also the burial place of the Counts of Erbach. During the Reformation the abbey was dissolved, in 1558. The empty buildings were occupied in 1562 by Huguenot refugees from Wallonia, to whom Schönau gave rights of residence. Buildings Physical remains of the abbey include the abbey church of c. 1230, and also the abbey gateway (c. 1200), the former refectory, and the \\"Walloon forge\\" (the former abbey forge, renovated by the Huguenot refugees from Wallonia after 1558).

The beginning of the art form  The oldest chainsaw artist records go back to the 1950s, which include artists Ray Murphy and Ken Kaiser. In 1952 Ray Murphy used his father's chainsaw to carve his name into a piece of wood. In 1961 Ken Kaiser created 50 carvings for the Trees of Mystery. Many new artists began to experiment with chainsaw carving, including Brenda Hubbard, Judy McVay, Don Colp, Cherie Currie (former Runaways lead singer), Susan Miller, Mike McVay, and Lois Hollingsworth. At this time chainsaw carvers started loading up their carvings in the back of their trucks, functioning as traveling galleries. In the 1980s the art form really began to grow with Art Moe getting much exposure for the craft at the Lumberjack World Championships held in Hayward, Wisconsin. This event was broadcast nationally. The addition of carving contests from the west coast to the east coast brought carvers together to test their skills and learn from each other. The first Chainsaw Carving World Championships was held in 1987 and won by then 24-year-old Barre Pinske. The 1980s also saw the development of the Cascade Chainsaw Sculptors Guild and their newsletter, The Cutting Edge, mailed out to many members throughout the Pacific Northwest and the rest of the United States. The 80's also brought the first book on chainsaw carving, Fun and Profitable Chainsaw Carving by William Westenhaver and Ron Hovde, published in 1982. Other books soon followed, including a book by Hal MacIntosh published in 1988 titled Chainsaw Art and in 2001 Chainsaw Carving: The Art and Craft. He published material on chainsaw carving that predated the popularity of the Internet. The first booking agency dedicated to promoting and preserving the integrity of performance chainsaw art was founded by Brian Ruth in 1992. It was appropriately named Masters of the Chainsaw. The company has represented some of the most respected artists in the U.S., such as Brian Ruth, Ben Risney, Josh Landry, Mark Tyoe and Marty Long, as well as select artists from other countries. In 2007, Masters of the Chainsaw, under the direction of Jen Ruth, created the first international group of female sculptors under the name Chainsaw Chix.Chainsaw Chix Featured in this all-female team are greats like Stephanie Huber, Angela Polglaze, Lisa Foster, Alicia Charlton, Uschi Elias, and Sara Winter. Brian Ruth introduced the art as a performance art to Japan in 1995. Since then, he has established a division of Masters of the Chainsaw and a chainsaw carving school in Tōei, Japan.Toei Chainsaw Art club Although the general impression of the public is that it is largely performance art (because of the noise, sawdust, and very fast carving results), there are a few chainsaw carvers now producing stunning works of art. These works can be produced in a fraction of the time that would normally be expected if only conventional tools such as mallet and gouges were used. Although many carvers continue to use other tools alongside the chainsaw, the chainsaw remains the primary tool.  The Carver Kings  With the growth of the Internet, chainsaw carving has become a worldwide phenomenon with chainsaw carvers all over the world. Most Notably in Canada Carver Kings Paul and Jacob take the stage performing on HGTV's \\"Carver Kings\\" and OLN's \\"Saw Dogs\\". Along with creating large scale semi abstract center pieces that have made it to many major states. You can follow them on Youtube Here  Today  In the United Kingdom, the English Open Chainsaw Competition draws thousands of visitors annually. In 1989 Duncan Kitson was the first British carver, with notable success, to represent Wales and The UK in international competition. His work is recognized for its individual, engineered and tactile qualities.The English Open Chainsaw Competition English chainsaw artist Matthew Crabb has carved the largest wooden statue of the Virgin Mary in the world, at 9 meters high, in Schochwitz, Germany.Exmoor The Country Magazine Welsh veteran, Harry Thomas of Thomas Carving is highly respected in the industry and specialises in bears, along with his son Danny Thomas. Harry has appeared on ITV's Daybreak, where he carved Queen Elizabeth II's head, in celebration of her Diamond Jubilee. In Canada, many wooden statues produced by the chainsaw artist Pete Ryan decorate the small town of Hope, British Columbia. Glenn Greensides, another Canadian artist, branched out into Japan in 1995 and visited Japan each year for 12 consecutive years to create one 5 meter tall sculpture from an exported British Columbia log depicting the upcoming year's Japanese zodiac symbol. In Japan, the Toei Chainsaw Art Club established the World Chainsaw Art Competition, which was the first chainsaw carving competition in the country. The 2011 World Chainsaw Art Competition at the Toei Dome was to be dedicated to raising money for disaster relief due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that has affected the country.Toei Chainsaw Art Club 1999 marked the first year of the Ridgway Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous. Every February hundreds of carvers go to a small town in the mountains of Pennsylvania for this event. The Chainsaw Carver Rendezvous is the biggest gathering of chainsaw carvers in the world and takes over the small town of Ridgway, Pennsylvania. In 2010 American sculptor Bob King was awarded a \\"Star/Sprocket\\" on the Carvers Walk of Fame in Mulda, Germany, the location of the World Cup competition. This award confirms Bob has won more carving competitions than any other carver in the world to date. In 2013, American chainsaw carver, Josh Landry, was awarded first place at the \\"Rally in the Valley\\" chainsaw carving competition. In previous years, Josh Landry was the youngest chainsaw carver participating in national and international chainsaw carving competitions. As the art has evolved, special chainsaw blades and chains have been developed for carving. In Finland such equipment is affectionally called konepuukko (\\"mechanical puukko\\"). The chainsaw \\"blades\\" are technically known as \\"guide bars\\". For chainsaw carving these bars have very small noses (typically around 25 mm diameter). This enables the artist to create detail in the carving that would be impossible with a standard guide bar. The chains that are used on these guide bars are normally modified by reducing the length of the teeth in order that they are able to cut efficiently at the tip of the bar. The reason for this modification is that all chains manufactured currently (circa 2007) are made to be used on standard guide bars only. These \\"carving bars\\" are manufactured by \\"Cannon\\", \\"GB\\", and by a companies in Japan supplying \\"Stihl\\" and others. The other very important advantage with these guide bars is that they do not \\"kickback\\" when using the tip. they are therefore very safe to use in comparison with standard guide bars. In order to reach the high levels of skill required to be a \\"chainsaw carver\\", a considerable amount of instruction and practice is required in the safe operation of a chainsaw. This is then followed by plenty of study and practice in carving basic shapes which then ultimately leads on to more ambitious projects. Chainsaw carvers wear protective clothing. A cut from a chainsaw is not just a cut, it actually removes a whole centimeter or more of flesh and bone. A victim can die very quickly from blood loss.  Chainsaw carvers' guilds  Two guilds have formed for chainsaw artists. The Cascade Chainsaw Sculptors Guild (CCSG)Cascade Chainsaw Sculptors Guild is a nonprofit organization that was founded by a group of chainsaw artists in 1986. In 1993, the CCSG started putting out a bimonthly newsletter, \\"The Cutting Edge\\". Another nonprofit guild, United Chainsaw Carvers Guild,United Chainsaw Carvers Guild was established in 2002 and published a quarterly newsletter titled \\"The Chainsaw Letter\\", but has since stopped publishing its newsletter. Both guilds claim to promote chainsaw art and the sharing of ideas amongst fellow artisans.

Their weight ranges from 2-10 lbs. It is typically found in clear, large creeks and rivers, though it is sometimes also found in lakes. They are sometimes speared or caught with hook and line using crayfish or worms as bait. A bottom-feeder, it feeds on mussels, snails, crustaceans and immature aquatic insects. Its common names include big-sawed sucker, river mullet, greater redhorse, redfin redhorse and redhorse sucker. It has the following characteristics: Distribution The river redhorse occurs throughout the central and eastern Mississippi River System and the Gulf Slope from Florida to Louisiana. In Canada, its distribution is characterized by disjunct populations in southern Ontario and Quebec as well as Alberta. This species has declined considerably over much of its range in the last 200 years. Populations still occur in the Grand, Trent, Thames, Mississippi, Gatineau and Richelieu rivers, and recent data suggest a wider distribution in the Ottawa River than previously documented. However, this fish appears to no longer exist in the Châteauguay and Yamaska watersheds and has declined dramatically in the St. Lawrence River. Threats Due to its narrow range of habitat preferences, spawning requirements and intolerance of high turbidity, siltation and pollution, the river redhorse is susceptible to a number of threats. Hydroelectric development and flood control dams cause habitat fragmentation and alter habitat conditions, resulting in restricted movements of individual fish and limited gene flow between populations. Also, changes in flow regime and siltation of spawning habitats may reduce recruitment. Agricultural and municipal activities that affect water quality (increased sediment load, excessive nutrients) also adversely impact this species. Because of its sensitivity, it is used as an indicator species to gauge stream health. Similar Species The river redhorse resembles all redhorse species especially the shorthead redhorse (M. macrolepidotum) and the Greater Redhorse (M. valenciennesi). The river redhorse can be distinguished, although with difficulty, from most other members of the genus by its heavy pharyngeal arch with molariform teeth. Additional features that may distinguish it from other redhorse sucker species include entirely plicate lips and caudal peduncle scale count.

The church is a Grade I listed building, having been upgraded from a Grade II* in March 2016. History Around 1774, Fr Charles Howard came from Marton to serve the small number of Catholics in Hull. In 1779 a chapel was established in Posterngate but it was destroyed in the Gordon Riots of 1780. Following the loss of the chapel Catholics were forced to meet in private until in 1798 when Fr Pierre Foucher arrived in Hull, fleeing the French Revolution. He was a wealthy man, possibly an aristocrat. He paid for a small chapel in North Street to be built from his own funds. He returned to France in 1820. Fr John Smith was appointed to replace Fr Foucher. He obtained a site in Jarratt Street and began the construction of the present church. The church opened on 29 July 1829. The building of the church was begun by the architect John Earle (1778–1863). It was remodelled soon afterward by J.J. Scoles. In later years the aisles were added and the present decor seen in the church was undertaken in 1899 under the stewardship of Canon Sullivan. Organ The present organ was bought for St Charles' in about 1866. It had been built for St John's Church, Hull in either 1812 or 1815. Before being placed in St Charles' it had been at St Wilfrid's York. It was rebuilt and the design was modified by Messrs Forster and Andrews in 1909. The organ was further amended in 1959. =List of organists= *Mr. Cummins 1829 - 1833 *T.F.

These include his home (Monticello), his retreat (Poplar Forest),the university he founded (University of Virginia), and his designs for the homes of friends and political allies (notably Barboursville). Over a dozen private homes bearing his personal stamp still stand today. Jefferson's style was popular in the early American period at about the same time that the more mainstream Greek Revival architecture was also coming into vogue (1790s–1830s) with his assistance. Sources and inspiration In colonial Virginia during the 18th century there were no schools of architecture, so Jefferson learned the trade on his own from various books and by studying some of the various classical architectural designs of the day. As a self-taught architect and classicist, he was most heavily influenced by the Italian revivalist architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). His \\"bible\\" was Andrea Palladio's The Four Books of Architecture, which taught him the basic principles of classical design.Brodie, 1974, pp.87-88Berstein, 2003, p. 9 Jeffersonian architecture is therefore perhaps best described as \\"Palladian\\" in inspiration. Jefferson was also influenced by architect James Gibbs (1682–1754), and by French Neo-classical buildings, such as the Hôtel de Salm in Paris, when he served as Ambassador to France. While the Jeffersonian style incorporates Palladian proportions and themes, it is at the same time unique to Jefferson's own personal sensibility and the materials available to him in early republican Virginia. Throughout his adult life Jefferson made many architectural drawings and wrote extensively about architectural design. Today there are over 600 pages of architectural documents by Jefferson now housed at the Massachusetts Historical Society and are commonly referred to as the Coolidge Collection.Jefferson Architectural Drawings, Massachusetts Historical Society Characteristics Poplar Forest, note the octagonal design One characteristic which typifies Jefferson's architecture is the use of the octagon and octagonal forms in his designs. Palladio never used octagons, but Jefferson employed them as a design motif—halving them, elongating them, and employing them in whole as with the dome of Monticello, or the entire house at Poplar Forest. =Jeffersonian architectural attributes= *Palladian design (e.g., central core, symmetrical wings)The Architectural Ideology of Thomas Jefferson by Ralph G. Giordano (McFarland; 2012) *Portico-and-pediment primary entries *Classical orders and moldings (especially Tuscan) *Piano nobile (main floor elevated above ground level) *Red brick construction *White painted trim *Sand painted columns *Octagons and octagonal forms *Chinese railings *\\"Suppressed\\" (hidden) stairs, instead of grand stairways Monticello Monticello Located just outside Charlottesville, Jefferson's Virginia home and estate is situated on the summit of an -high peak in the Southwest Mountains. Its name comes from the Italian for \\"little mountain.\\" Jefferson began work on his original “Monticello” in 1768. He left his home in 1784 to serve as Minister of the United States to France. During his tenure in Europe, he had an opportunity to see some of the classical buildings with which he had become acquainted from his reading, as well as to discover the \\"modern\\" trends in French architecture that were then fashionable in Paris. His decision to remodel his own home may date from this period. In 1794, following his service as the first U.S. Secretary of State (1790–93), Jefferson began rebuilding his manor house based on the ideas he had acquired in Europe. The remodeling continued throughout most of his presidency (1801–09). Jefferson added a center hallway and a parallel set of rooms to the structure, more than doubling its area. He removed the second full-height story from the original house and replaced it with a mezzanine bedroom floor. The most dramatic element of the new design was an octagonal dome, which he placed above the West front of the building in place of a second-story portico. The room inside the dome was described by a visitor as \\"a noble and beautiful apartment,\\" but it was rarely used—perhaps because it was hot in summer and cold in winter, or because it could only be reached by climbing a steep and very narrow flight of stairs. The dome room has now been restored to its appearance during Jefferson's lifetime, with \\"Mars yellow\\" walls and a painted green floor, although safety regulations about use of the narrow stairs to the upper floors largely preclude visitors to Monticello from seeing the room. Monticello, along with the nearby University of Virginia, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Influence In 1803, President Jefferson appointed Benjamin Henry Latrobe as surveyor of public buildings in the United States, thus introducing Greek Revival architecture to the country for the first time. Latrobe went on to design a number of important public buildings in Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, including work on the United States Capitol and the Bank of Pennsylvania. Even after Jefferson's style went out of vogue for other public buildings, it continued to have an influence on many Protestant church designs on the East Coast through the mid-20th century. The style is still employed on some Southern college campuses, particularly in Virginia and the Peabody College campus of Vanderbilt University, and it has enjoyed a certain re- emergence among some newer 21st century evangelical church complexes. The University of Mary Washington, previously the University of Virginia's college for women, is another primary example of Jefferson's architecture. An example of Jeffersonian architecture outside the United States can be found in one of China's top universities, Tsinghua University in Beijing. The University's \\"Grand Auditorium\\" was designed with elements from the Jeffersonian architectural style in the early 20th century.

He was noted as one of the key philosophers and founding personality of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and as a major contributor to the initial Left of Centre/Social Democratic so- called Basic Programme of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). He was also founder of Qaumi Mahaz-i-Azadi which he founded after leaving PPP in 1977. In addition, he was a well-known and influential socialist figure in the country, and known for his political struggle and advocacy against anti-capitalist convergence and the support of the social democracy. Early life Meraj Muhammad Khan was born on 20 October 1938 in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, British Indian Empire to an educated family of Zakha Khel Afridi tribe of Pashtun origin. He was the youngest of four sons and his father, Hakeem Molvi Taj Muhammad Khan, was a homoeopath who practised the methods of Greek medicine in Quetta, Balochistan. His elder brother was the famous Pakistani journalist Minhaj Barna.Icon of struggle Barna is dead Dawn (newspaper), Published 14 January 2011, Retrieved 28 July 2019 After graduating from a local high school in Quetta in 1956, Khan moved to Karachi where he attended DJ Science College and later pursued his higher education at Karachi University in 1957. He earned a BA degree in philosophy and humanities in 1960, and an MA degree in philosophy in 1962. =Communism and PPP activism= Meraj Muhammad Khan came to public prominence in the 1960s while studying at Karachi University. During this time, there was a debating competition in which students from all the colleges of Karachi were participating. At this competition, some activists of the Communist Party were sitting in the audience, who asked him to join the Communist Party after he won that debating competition. He became an active member of the National Students Federation (NSF), eventually becoming NSF's president in 1963. Khan turned the NSF into a militant student political organisation that campaigned for the rights of students. In 1967, he quit the NSF after secretly learning of a socialist convention being held in Lahore, Punjab. He was among those who founded the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and fully endorsed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for the PPP's chairmanship. Through the PPP, he went into mainstream politics and successfully contested the 1970 general elections on a PPP platform from a Karachi constituency called Lalukhait. =Labour ministry (1971–1973)= In December 1971, Khan was appointed Minister for Manpower and directed the Ministry of Labour (MoL) in Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government. In 1972, his tenure saw a major labour strike in Karachi; though it was peacefully resolved by Meraj's intervention. It was later reported in newspapers and television that the labour strike was actually a competition between two PPP ministers, Meraj and Law Minister Abdul Hafiz Pirzada for the control of the labour. Meraj's radical leftist group was in direct competition against Law Minister Pirzada's Pro-Peking group. However, Meraj denied all accusations on the television. In 1973, Meraj fell out with the Bhutto government when Bhutto started to compromise on his so-called Socialist agenda and the regime resorted to repressive measures. As time passed, his differences with Prime Minister Bhutto grew and he left the PPP to reorganise the NSF. However, Meraj fell into political isolation, never to regain his political credibility and popularity. Commenting on PPP, Meraj later revealed that \\"the radical (leftist) rhetoric was more than a mask designed to win and retain power.\\" He once said: \\"Ali Bhutto was a great man ... but he could be cruel.\\" =Political activism (1980s-until his death)= After leaving the PPP, he became a prominent democratic activist and leftist leader of the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD) opposing the military government of President General Zia-ul-Haq. =Awami Insaf and the birth of PTI Basic Programme= In 1998, he joined the center-left/centrist Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) headed by Imran Khan, but resigned from the party in 2003, citing differences with Khan. He then joined the Mazdoor Kisan Party, which later merged with the Communist Party of Pakistan to form the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party. Death Meraj Muhammad Khan died at a local hospital in Karachi on 21 July 2016 at age 77. He had been hospitalized for a serious respiratory and lung problem for some time.

Fan film work Wieber became enamored of the Star Wars franchise when he saw the visual effects in the film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, which he characterizes as \\"spectacular\\". He began mimicking the Star Wars visual effects using his Canon GL-1 camcorder and a PC that he built using two AMD microprocessors, each of which ran at 1.67 GHz in clock speed. His portfolio grew to include a number of different lightsaber battles, including a short clip of showing Wieber fighting himself. He also managed has his friends star in videos in which they would shoot \\"force lightning\\" from their hands. =Ryan vs. Dorkman= Ryan vs. Dorkman was first released to the internet on March 1, 2003. It was produced as an entry in a lightsaber choreography competition hosted by TheForce.net, a prominent Star Wars fan site noted for its fan film-making community. According to the official TFN entry for the film, the backstory involves Ryan and Michael, or \\"Ryan_W\\" and \\"DorkmanScott\\", as they are known on TheForce.net's forums, meeting after their friendly online rivalry over who is the better saber artist, and fighting to the death with actual lightsabers.\\"Ryan Wieber vs. Michael 'Dorkman' Scott\\".

In early 2006, the short became a viral video after being posted on such websites as eBaumsworld, CollegeHumor, and the front page of YouTube as a \\"Featured Video.\\" There was also a notable version uploaded to Google Video. =Ryan vs Dorkman 2= Wieber and Scott announced in May 2006 that they would be producing a sequel. Ryan vs. Dorkman 2 (RvD2) was shot in Atlanta, Georgia in August 2006. They released a sneak peek of the film online in December 2006.Wieber, Ryan; Scott, Michael (December 6, 2006). \\"RVD2 Sneak Peek\\". YouTube. The film's score was recorded with a 60 piece orchestra at Capitol Studios in Hollywood. To accomplish this goal, film composers Gordy Haab and Kyle Newmaster donated their time and talents to the project. The film's creators solicited donations from fans in order to pay the musicians. M.B Gordy (lead percussionist from Battlestar Galactica) provided the percussion. The film premiered in February 2007 at the Wilshire Fine Arts Theatre in Los Angeles before being released on the internet on March 1, 2007. Because of the viral popularity of RvD and RvD2, Ryan and Michael were invited to appear alongside many other internet celebrities in the music video \\"Pork and Beans\\" by Weezer. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 Star Wars fanfilms. =Other films= Ryan vs Brandon is another lightsaber project in the vein of Ryan vs Dorkman; in this case, Wieber's opponent is Brandon Flyte, another fan film effects artist. Like RvD, RvB was created for one of the Lightsaber Choreography Competitions on TheForce.net/FanFilms.com forums, which it won. A sequel duel, Ryan vs. Brandon 2, was released in 2011. Wieber and Michael \\"Dorkman\\" Scott served as visual effects supervisors for the Star Wars fanfilm The Formula, directed by Chris Hanel and Steve Phelan. This was Wieber and Scott's first visual effects collaboration and led to them becoming friends. As of 2014, a duel called Ryan vs Nate was shooting but production was placed on-hold after Ryan's finger was broken. Professional career According to a May 30, 2004 San Francisco Chronicle, Wieber had been contacted approximately a year prior by Clint Young, a senior effects artist at LucasArts in San Rafael, California, who had seen his light-saber fan films and was impressed. Upon calling Wieber's house and speaking to Wieber's mother, Young was surprised to learn that Wieber was a 19-year-old working at Blockbuster Video, commenting, \\"I just assumed that he was already working at an effects office.\\" Young eventually spoke with Wieber, and by that September, Wieber was working at LucasArts as an associate effects artist. Young sees Wieber's transition from fan filmmaker to professional as a result of video cameras and PCs becoming more affordable to the masses. Alex Dunne, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, concurs, saying, \\"It's a natural progression in the industry to see kids younger and younger filling the ranks\\". Wieber stayed with LucasArts until October 2004. He went to work for Stargate Digital as a compositor in April 2005.Ryan-W.com. Retrieved February 1, 2013. His contributions to primetime television effects work include the NBC TV drama Heroes. On September 8, 2007, Wieber won an Emmy Award in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects For A Miniseries, Movie Or A Special\\" for his work as Lead Visual Effects Compositor on the TNT anthology TV series Nightmares and Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King.Mesger, Robin (September 8, 2007). \\"59th Annual Emmy Winners\\".

The shorthead redhorse is native to central and eastern North America. However, its range has expanded to include areas like the Hudson estuary and Grayson County, Texas. It inhabits small to large rivers and lakes, and lives in the benthic zone. Shorthead redhorse feed on benthic invertebrates and can consume plant material from the benthic environment that it inhabits. When it spawns, shorthead redhorse move into more shallow streams and spawn over gravel or rocky shoals. They will also spawn in springs with swift moving water. The shorthead redhorse is important to humans because it is a game fish. It is also important to anglers because of its role in the ecosystem; it is prey for larger game fish such as northern pike and muskellunge. One source gives one of its English names as \\"common mullet\\". Others are redfin, redfin sucker, red sucker, redhorse mullet, shorthead mullet, mullet, bigscale sucker, common redhorse, northern redhorse, Des Moines Plunger. Geographic distribution Historically, the shorthead redhorse is native to North America. Its native range includes the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, Mississippi River, and Saint Lawrence River basins.Hammerson, G. 2006. Moxostoma macrolepidotum. NatureServe Explorer 06:01 http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Moxostoma%20macrolepidotum They ranged across from Quebec to Alberta and as far south as northern Alabama and Oklahoma.Fuller, P. 2011. Moxostoma macrolepidotum. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=366 Shorthead redhorse also originally occupied the Atlantic Slope drainages, ranging from the Hudson River in New York to the Santee River in South Carolina. When the Tennessee Valley Authority started building dams in the 1930s in an attempt to create power, the dams blocked different fish such as striped bass, from moving upstream to their spawning ranges. While some fish ranges have decreased since the construction of the dams, the shorthead redhorse's range has expanded. The shorthead redhorse is a “habitat generalist near the core of its range,” so it can tolerate disturbance better than other related redhorse species such as the river redhorse, M. carinatum.Reid, S.M., Wilson, C. C., Carl, L.M., and Zorn, T.G. 2008. Species traits influence the genetic consequences of river fragmentation on two co-occurring redhorse (Moxostoma) species. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science 9:1892-1904. Shorthead redhorse can now be found in the tidal zones of the Hudson River. They are believed to have invaded the Hudson by way of the Mohawk River and have established themselves in the Hudson estuary. Other areas they have been found in include the Embarras River system in Illinois and the Red River below Lake Texoma dam in Grayson County, Texas. Ecology Shorthead redhorse have a wide habitat range. They live in fresh water and are found in streams, lakes and rivers.Froese, R. 2010. Moxostoma macrolepidotum. FishBase http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?genusname=Moxostoma&speciesname;=macrolepidotum Shorthead redhorse can tolerate clear to cloudy water and likes loose substrate like gravel and sand.Hatch, J. T. 2002. Shorthead Redhorse. MinnAqua Program http://hatch.cehd.umn.edu/research/fish/fishes/shorthead_redhorse.html#predator These fish are benthic feeders that like to feed in riffles and rifle margins.Sule, M. J., Skelly, T. M. 1985. The life history of the shorthead redhorse, Moxostoma macrolepidotum, in the Kankakee River Drainage, Illinois. Illinois Natural History Survey 85:123. During a study done in Illinois by Sule et al., they found that “shorthead redhorse consumed items from approximately 60 food categories, primarily invertebrate taxa”. Twenty-four to sixty-eight percent of their diet was unidentified when stomach contents were analyzed. Also found, 21-50% of the unidentified matter, or 13% of their total diet, was organic matter. Shorthead redhorse eat the most insects out of all the fish in the sucker family. They can also eat microcrustacea and plant matter. Predators of shorthead redhorse vary depending on size. Juveniles can be eaten by northern pike, walleyes, and smallmouth bass. Adult or larger shorthead redhorse are eaten by northern pike and muskellunge. The shorthead redhorse does not actively compete for food. Because of their wide range of prey and eating the most vertebrates of all the suckers, they do not have a competitor. Humans impact shorthead redhorse habitat. The construction of dams blocked free flowing rivers like the Mississippi in which they live, disrupting their spawning migration routes. Shorthead redhorse are killed easily by pollutants in the water. “The upstream migratory range of shorthead redhorse in a Maryland river decreased due to an increase in chlorinated sewage outfalls”. Factory pollutants are dumped into streams or rivers and will settle onto the bottom. Because such a large portion of the shorthead redhorse's diet is sediment,Doyle, J.R., Al-Ansari, A.M., Gendron, R.L., White, P.A., Blais, J.M. 2011. A method to estimate sediment ingestion by fish. Aquatic Toxicology 1-2:121-127. it ingests high concentrations of the chemicals and can die. Life history The shorthead redhorse spawning season ranges from March to June, depending on location. In order to spawn, the water temperature has to be between 7 and 16 degrees Celsius. Shorthead redhorse spawn once a year and will travel either upstream or downstream to reach their spawning ground. Spawning areas are usually smaller rivers or steams. They are locally migrant so they do not travel long distances to get their spawning area. Shorthead redhorse spawn in shallows at the edges of sand bars or in rifles over gravel substrate. During spawning, females can produce anywhere from 18,000 to 44,000 eggs. It can take anywhere from 2-5, even 6 years for a shorthead redhorse to become sexually mature. In northern areas of cooler water, growth rates tend to be lower than more southern, warmer areas.Reid, S.M. 2009. Age, growth and mortality of black redhorse (Moxostoma duquesnei) and shorthead redhorse (M-macrolepidotum) in the Grand River, Ontario. Journal of Applied Ichthyology 2:178-183. The average life span of the shorthead redhorse varies depending on location. More northern locations with cooler water tend to have shorthead redhorse that can live to be older than 17 years of age. Typical adult size is 12-18 inches in length, and 2-3 pounds, although some individuals can reach up to 25 inches in length and 6 pounds in weight.http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/species-and-habitats/species-guide- index/fish/shorthead-redhorse However, in more southern, warmer water areas, such as the Kankakee River, the average max age is only six to seven. As mentioned previously, the construction of dams has not had a large effect on the population of shorthead redhorse, but it has had some effect. The dams affect the shorthead redhorse just as they do other fish by blocking migration pathways to spawning areas. Because of the wide range and great abundance of the shorthead redhorse, no negative effects of dams have been accounted for in their population. Current management The shorthead redhorse is abundant across its range and has one of the largest ranges of any sucker.Mongeau, J. R., Dumont, P., and Cloutier, L. 1992. Comparison of the life-cycles of the copper redhorse (Moxostoma- hubbis) and 4 other Moxostoma Species (M- anisurum, M-carinatum, M- macrolepidotum and M-valenciennes). Canadian Journal of Zoology 7:1354-1363. This species is not endangered or threatened and is not currently at risk. As of 2002 there was no management plan for the shorthead redhorse.  Relationship with humans  Its small size limits the appeal of shorthead redhorse as a game fish. The shorthead redhorse is said to be one of the better tasting fish, however there are many little bones throughout the meat making it unappealing to many American consumers. The meat also spoils rapidly in warm temperatures making it hard to transport. Shorthead redhorse play a key role in their ecosystems as prey for larger game fish. They are often used for bait if caught small enough. Humans impact the population the most through chemical contamination of their habitat. Bioaccumulation of chemicals is common in fish that feed near the benthic zone, like the shorthead redhorse.Al-Ansari, A.M., Saleem, A., Kimpe, L.E., Sherry, J.P., McMaster, M.E., Trudeau, V.L., and Blais, J. M. 2010. Bioaccumulation of the pharmaceutical 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol in shorthead redhorse suckers (Moxostoma macrolepidotum) from the St. Clair River, Canada.

Thibaudet saw that, over time, issues that previously had not been politicised would emerge, drawing public concern and stimulating a demand for political action. A new political movement would form to champion the new concerns, and this would send repercussions throughout the existing political system. The old party of the left would be split, with some accepting the new issues as legitimate, agreeing to cooperate with the newcomers and adapting their ideology accordingly. Others on the existing left would double down on their existing ideas, refusing change: without having changed their ideas, they would end up pushed de facto one space to the right, and end up as the new centre. Meanwhile, the old party of the centre would be pushed to the centre-right, and so on. As for the very far right, over time the issues of social conservation that motivated them would gradually lose their appeal, and as old issues died off space would be freed up for the old right to become the new far right. France provided the quintessential example. The socially- conservative Liberal Monarchists had been the centre-left of the 1820s, but were pushed to become the new centre by the emergence of socially-conservative republicans (modérés or républicains opportunistes) in the 1830s. These were pushed to the centre by the emergence of the Radicals in the 1870s; these were pushed to the centre by the emergence in the 1900s of the Radical-Socialists, who were pushed towards the centre by the growth of the socialist French Section of the Workers' International in the 1920s, who were in turn pushed towards the centre by the emergence in the 1950s of the French Communist Party. This process (seen by Thibaudet as a historical necessity) thus explained, to Thibaudet, the tendency of social-conservatives, particularly in France, to disavow the label droite (right), long associated in French history with monarchism, in favour of left. The emergence of new rivals to their left meant that a political bloc suddenly found itself shifted one space to the right, without considering itself to be a party of the right: thus, political groups in France usually used labels that to an outsider would seem to belong one space to the left: * Radical deputies who had once belonged, unambiguously, to the Radical political family were forced to decide whether or not to join the new Radical-Socialist and Radical Republican Party when this was created in 1901. Those who did not, such as the historic Radical leader Georges Clemenceau, were thus pushed into the centre-right though still considered themselves men of the left. As a result, the non-Radical-Socialist Radicals continued to call their parliamentary party the \\"Radical Left\\", though they were now a party of the centre-right almost indistinguishable from the Liberals to their immediate right. * Liberal deputies with socially- conservative views but who accepted economic laissez-faire, parliamentary sovereignty and constitutionalism, were in 1900 situated on the centre-left. As a result, they labelled their parliamentary group the \\"Republican Left\\", even when, twenty years later, they were situated firmly on the centre-right of most issues. After the Second World War this terminology persisted: the group that gathered up miscellaneous Radicals and Liberals situated between the Socialists and the Christian-Democrats termed themselves the Rally of Left Republicans. * Catholics and conservatives who accepted the legality of the Republican regime could be found in two groups by 1900. The first, ideologically conservative but tactically accepting the existence of the Third Republic, labelled themselves the \\"Constitutional\\" or \\"Republican Right\\", whereas those who had a more sincere acceptance of the republican constitution formed, between 1899 and 1901, a party labelled \\"Liberal Action\\". Thus the * Monarchists who were elected to parliament under the Third Republic at first proudly displayed that label. Over time, however, it became politically unacceptable to do so, and they shifted their terminology. Thus by the time Thibaudet was writing in 1931, the monarchists on the far-right of parliament labelled themselves \\"Conservatives\\" (a term associated since 1818 with absolute monarchists), \\"Independents\\" (a term associated from 1900 with the Action Francaise), or \\"National Republicans\\" (a term associated with Bonapartists and the Jeunesses Patriotes)—labels which to an outsider might seem more logical belonging on the centre-right. This phenomenon was still at play well into the 20th-century. Historian René Rémond observed that after 1924 the term \\"right wing\\" vanished from the glossary of mainstream politics in France, such that \\"at the 1974 presidential election, only one candidate declared himself as belonging to the right: Jean-Marie Le Pen; in 1981, there was none.\\"René Rémond, Les Droites en France, p. 391, Aubier, 1982—new edition of La Droite en France, 1954 Conservative (which had been the name of an ultra-royalist review in 1818–1820) was a synonym of \\"right wing\\" often used under the Third Republic, in particular by the Bloc national Chamber. Independents, used in the 1920s for deputies close to the Action française royalist movement, was later used by less reactionary politicians.

Stift Viktring is now the name of the Roman Catholic parish in Viktring, since 1973 a district of the Carinthian capital Klagenfurt. History Abbey church Viktring Abbey was established in 1142 by Cistercian monks from Villers-Bettnach Abbey in the Duchy of Lorraine (in the modern Saint-Hubert), of the filiation of Morimond. Its lands were probably a gift of Count Bernhard of Spanheim-Marburg (Maribor), brother of Duke Engelbert of Carinthia, and his wife Kunigunde, daughter of Margrave Ottokar II of Styria. As early as 13 May in the following year the first abbot, Eberhard, was consecrated. The abbey church was dedicated 60 years later by Eberhard of Regensburg, Archbishop of Salzburg, in 1202. In 1234 the Carinthian duke Bernhard von Spanheim founded Landstrass Abbey, latterly also known as Kostanjevica Abbey, a daughter house of Viktring in the March of Carniola, in the modern Kostanjevica in Slovenia. The most notable abbot was the chronicler John of Viktring, confidant of Duke Henry of Bohemia, who assumed his office in 1312. Under Abbot Johannes II in 1411 the greater part of Viktring Abbey burnt down. Vigorous re-building in the abbey and the parishes belonging to it was however made possible by decree of the Cistercian General Chapter. In 1447 the German king Frederick III of Habsburg presented the abbey church with an altar. Viktring Abbey was dissolved during the rationalist reforms of Emperor Joseph II by decree of 19 May 1786. The parish of Stift Viktring retained possession only of the church and the former priest's house. The altar was removed to St. Bernard's Abbey in Wiener Neustadt, and when that was merged into Heiligenkreuz Abbey in 1885, sold to St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, where it is to be seen opposite Emperor Frederick's tomb. Moro Brothers textile factory Arms of the Moro family, granted with the title of Ritter in 1820 Part of the premises and lands were bought at auction on 10 November 1788 by the brothers Johann and Christoph Moro, who set up a textile factory here. In 1796 they succeeded in acquiring a long lease of the lordship of Viktring. The rise of the firm \\"Gebrüder Moro\\" was spectacular; in 1816 the Austrian Emperor Francis I of Habsburg visited the factory with his wife Caroline Augusta of Bavaria. The firm painstakingly cultivated its connections to the Imperial family, and received further visits in 1850 and 1852 from Emperor Franz Joseph. By 1897 the Moro family had acquired the entire monastery and its rights. In 1925 Adeline von Botka, the last surviving member of the family, sold the textile factory \\"Gebrüder Moro\\" to Baron Josef Aichelburg-Zosenegg. In 1942 he committed suicide, and the company was taken over by the \\"Hamburger Aero-Maschinen- und Werkzeugfabrik\\". In 1956 the Reichmann company acquired the concern, but went out of business ten years later. In 1970 the Austrian government bought the buildings and set up a secondary school here in 1977, which in 1980 became independent as the \\"Realgymnasium unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der musischen Ausbildung\\". On 23 September 1999 the official opening of the BRG Klagenfurt-Viktring, well known for its specialisation in musical education, took place.

History During the 1950s and early 1960s Fender's twangy single-coil sound enjoyed considerable popularity. This began to wane by the mid-1960s as new stars like Eric Clapton and Mike Bloomfield plugged their humbucker-equipped Gibsons into over-driven Marshall amplifiers. Many players began to look for a thicker, creamier sound that the standard Telecaster didn't deliver. To achieve this sound, many players replaced the standard single coil pickups on their Telecasters and installed aftermarket humbuckers (a good example of this is Keith Richards' modified Fender Telecaster nicknamed Micawber). Another reason for replacing the Telecaster neck pickup was that many players felt it lacked a \\"Rock and Roll vibe\\". The original single coil neck pickup excels in jazz and blues tones but players felt replacing it with a more powerful humbucker pickup would give the Telecaster a second rock voice to match the Telecaster's popular bridge pickup. The Custom (along with the Thinline and Deluxe models) was an attempt to enter the humbucker market largely dominated by Gibson. Fender's first humbucking design was the Wide Range humbucker created by Seth Lover, who had overseen the development of the original Gibson humbucker. When Lover's association with Gibson came to an end Fender approached him to design a pick-up which would enable them to compete with his previous employer. The resulting pick-up first appeared in the Thinline and Deluxe range of Fender Telecasters introduced in 1972. Lover's Fender humbucker is felt by many to be brighter with more bottom end than his Gibson versions, and a better match for the classic, Fender bridge pickup. The original Custom was in production from 1972 until 1981, initially sporting a curly \\"Custom\\" logo (until early 1973, when the \\"Custom\\" logo was updated to the standard italicized block typeface used on most Fender guitars and basses of the period) and \\"Witch-Hat\\" volume and tone knobs until the first half of 1977, when the knobs changed to Stratocaster types. Fender used denser wood for this model, resulting in a significantly heavier instrument (nine pounds versus the average Telecaster's seven). The resulting sound is much thicker and less sharply defined. Few well-known players of the time picked up on the Custom apart from Keith Richards, who used one as his main guitar from 1975 until 1983, and Mick Green (guitarist for The Pirates, Johnny Kidd, David Monteverde (guitarist for Goutucucha), Bryan Ferry, Van Morrison and Paul McCartney) who wielded a natural-finish 'second-version' Custom. Popularity The Telecaster Custom was introduced just around the time that Fender began to lose its reputation as a quality instrument company. Blighted with Fender's allegedly unstable 3 bolt adjustable neck joint and the characteristic 1970's-style \\"notchless\\" upper cutaway, the Custom was also tarnished by negative perceptions surrounding the Pre / Post-CBS quality control debate. Were this not enough, the Custom was also more expensive than the standard Telecaster. Despite high hopes, sales never reached the levels that Fender had anticipated. The Reissue 1972 Telecaster Custom As with the other guitars in the '72 reissue series, the Custom has enjoyed much of its popularity long after the cessation of its original production run. Fender Japan was the first to release a reissue of the Custom, which benefited from being substantially lighter than the original and thus less tonally inert. Following the Japanese re-issue, Fender moved production to its Ensenada facility in Mexico - the MIM reissues are now the predominate versions in Europe and the United States. It is generally accepted among players that the Japanese version is superior to the Mexican version in construction, though some believe the Japanese ceramic humbucker suffers by comparison with the Mexican model's Alnico humbucker. The higher-end Factory Special Run (FSR) editions of the guitar are made at the Fender Custom Shop (USA). Differences: The re-issues and road worn copies feature a different bridge to the original Telecaster Custom, and re-issues are supplied only in a choice of either black or sunburst. The re-issue body differs from the original in having the deeper upper cutaway characteristic of modern standard Telecasters. Perhaps the most well-known difference is the reissue Wide Range Humbucker pick-up. Both the Mexican and the Japanese versions feature a reissued version of the Fender Wide Range humbucking pickup, each of which differs fundamentally in construction from the original. The original WRH used magnetized CuNiFe (copper, nickel and iron) polepieces (\\"slugs\\") with a copper wiring around the slugs, while the reissue has a standard non-magnetized set of slugs with an AlNiCo (aluminum, nickel, Cobalt) magnetized bar underneath. This standard humbucker is fitted in the larger casing of the original pickup, using wax to fill the void. The original WRH measured an average of 10.6 kΩ and used a 1 MΩ audio volume pot (P/N 021832) and a 1 MΩ LIN (P/N 010188) tone pot, while the reissue measures a fairly standard 8 kΩ and uses 250 kΩ volume and tone pots. This results in a much darker sounding reissue wide range pickup. Criticisms of the reissue Wide Range Humbucker and the escalating cost of parted-out original pick-ups has led to the establishment of a small but thriving aftermarket sector. Suppliers of boutique WRH replacements can be found in the USA and the UK. Some pick-up specialists also offer a re-winding / rebuilding service designed to return the reissue pickup to the original Seth Lover specifications. 2010 Fender Custom Shop Q1 Limited 72 Telecaster Custom In 2010 the Fender Custom Shop released a limited issue of 30 '72 Telecaster Custom relics. While they used some of the original '72 design features such as the three bolt neck and the classic look, these guitars had many more differences from the originals. The body is made of ash, and features a belly cut. The neck is one piece maple with a flatter 9.5 inch radius and larger 6105 frets. The head stock has the original design \\"Custom\\" logo. The neck pickup is a custom wound wide range humbucker. Alnico 2 magnets were used which more closely resemble the sound of the CuNiFe magnets used the original Seth Lover pickup (I have only been able to verify this with a phone call to Fenders customer service). The bridge pickup is a \\"hot nocaster\\". The overwound pickup has more output which better matches the output of the neck pickup. These guitars are distinguished from production reissues by a \\"Custom Shop Limited Edition\\" logo on the back of the head stock and also on the neck plate. (Telecaster research quoted from Walter Carter's book Classic Electrics, ). 2011 Fender American Vintage Reissue 72 Telecaster Custom In 2011, Fender released the American Vintage reissue '72 Telecaster Custom, replicating the original '72 design features such as the three bolt neck and the classic look, with improved construction and quality. In particular, the American Vintage ’72 Telecaster Custom includes a solid ash body with gloss lacquer finish; C-shaped neck with gloss lacquer finish; maple fingerboard; American Vintage single-coil telecaster bridge pickup, Fender wide range humbucker in the neck, a three-position switch with aged white tip, and a vintage-style three-saddle strings-through-body telecaster bridge.

The silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum: Maxostoma= mouth to suck; anisurum = unequal tail) is a species of freshwater fish endemic to Canada and the United States.Phillips G., Schmid W., Underhill J. 1982. Fishes of the Minnesota Region. University of Minnesota. 162-163. Sometimes called redhorse or sucker for short, the it is in the family Catostomidae with other suckers. The species is distributed from Quebec to Alberta and is also in the Mississippi River, St. Lawrence River, Ohio River, and the Great Lakes basins. Morphology The silver redhorse is silver on both sides and has a dark gray-brown back and a slate gray tail. The caudal fin is large and moderately forked. Each lobe of the fin is pointed and equal in size.Page L., Burr B. 1991. Freshwater Fishes. Lawrance M. Page and Brooks M. Buur. 186. Print On the silver sides there is 41-42 cycloid lateral line scales.http://www.seagrant.wisc.edu/home/Default.aspx?tabid=605&FishID;=133 The single dorsal fin does not have any dorsal spines, but instead contains 14-17 soft rays. Their dorsal fin is slightly convex (rounded outward) and is located approximately in the middle of the back. There is no adipose fin (unstructured fin found behind the rayed dorsal fin) present on the back of the fish. The mouth of the silver redhorse is in the inferior position, as it is a bottom feeder. The rear edge of the silver redhorse lips forms a deep \\"V\\". Because of extreme similarities, the silver red horse is commonly confused with the Black redhorse and the Golden redhorse. However both of these redhorses have slightly concave dorsal fins (curves in toward body) with only 12-14 fin rays. Additionally the Silver red horse is more deep bodied than the golden or black redhorse. It typically weights 2-5 pounds and measures 18-24 inches long, but it can reach up to 10 pounds and 30 inches.http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/species-and-habitats/species-guide- index/fish/silver-redhorse Geographic distribution The native range of the silver red horse is the great lakes and the St. Lawrence and Mississippi River basins. However, there have been instances in which the fish was found in Clayton lake and the New River Drainage in North Carolina.https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=2912 The silver redhorse is also widely distributed in eastern North America from Missouri to Quebec with most residing in the southeastern United States.McAllister, Chris T. et al. \\"Distribution of the Silver Redhorse, Moxostoma Anisurum (Cypriniformes: Catostomidae), in Arkansas.\\" Southwestern Naturalist 54.4 (2009): 514-518. It is typically found in lakes and in small to large rivers, where it often lives in undercut banks or protruding tree roots. They are also found in deep pools with little to no current and a sand substrate at the bottom of the pool useful for burying their eggs. They are a good indicator of water quality as they cannot tolerate murky water. Diet Due to its inferior mouth position, this fish is a bottom feeder. It feeds on mollusks, algae, detritus, immature insects, and other small invertebrates. Monogenea parasites have been found in the gills of the silver redhorse.Mergo, J. C., and A. M. White \\"2 New Species of Dactylogyridae (Monogenea) from the Silver Redhorse, Moxostoma anisurum.\\" Journal of Parasitology 68.5 (1982): 946-948. Life history The silver redhorse generally spawns in the spring in or around April or May when the water temperatures reach around 53 degree Fahrenheit. They take advantage of the shallow landforms flowing channels, also known as riffles, and spawn at the top and the bottoms of the riffles at night. One study in Quebec, Canada found that the silver redhorse is abundant in what they call V-males, as they outnumber the females considerably. For every female on the spawning bed, there is a minimum of 2 males that are used to successfully reproduce.Comtois, A. et al \\"The Spring Survey of a Multi- specific Spawning Ground: The Ichtyofauna of the Rapids of the Gatineau River, Quebec.\\" Canadian Field-Naturalist 118.4 (2004): 521-529. Print The common methodology includes two males pressing a female between them, causing a vibration to occur while the egg and the sperm are released. The females bury their eggs in the gravel and offer no further parental care. Reproduction maturity for the species happens late in its life usually around four to five years of age. The species thrives in deep bottomed lakes and river systems which promote optimal nest succession year in and year out. The life span for the species is somewhere around 10–12 years, with 14 being the maximum.http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/fish/moxostomaan.html Relationship with humans The species is quite abundant in southeastern rivers including the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio river systems. The silver redhorse is not commercially or recreationally fished for through most the areas in which it inhabits.. Currently, this species is of relatively low conservation concern and does not require significant protection or major management. Localized threats may exist, but on a range-wide scale no major threats are known. However, the silver redhorse is listed as threatened in the Strawberry River basin in Arkansas. The IGFA all tackle record stands at 11lbs 7oz caught from Plum Creek in Wisconsin in 1985.

Law and Chaos are in constant struggle, but they are kept in check by the Cosmic Balance, an even more powerful force for neutrality. The Eternal Champion acts to balance the advances of Law and Chaos as a servant of the Cosmic Balance, reincarnated or summoned to the worlds of the Multiverse where Chaos or Law is becoming dominant. Mark Scroggins, Michael Moorcock: Fiction, Fantasy and the World's Pain. McFarland, 2015 (pgs. 10, 28-9) The Elric series contains the most information about Law, Chaos, and the Balance, as well as the beings called the Lords of the Higher Worlds: the deities who serve and represent Chaos or Law. This may be explained by three reasons. (1) Moorcock has written more about Elric than any other character. (2) Elric spends more time interacting with deities and cosmic forces because he is a powerful sorcerer. (3) The Lords of the Higher Worlds are more numerous in Elric's world or interact with it more frequently. In an episode mirrored in The Vanishing Tower and The King of the Swords, Elric meets another incarnation of the Eternal Champion, Corum Jhaelen Irsei, who explains to him: :There are many planes of existence. In some the Lords of Chaos are strong. In some they are weak. In some, I have heard, they do not exist at all. In the world of Hawkmoon, for example, Chaos is powerful but is seldom personified. The Lords of the Higher Worlds appear mainly in the series about Elric and Corum. Variations exist in the allegiance of intelligent races to Law or Chaos. In Elric's world, humans are naturally inclined towards Law and must pervert themselves to gain the assistance of Chaos, while the inhuman Melnibonéans feel a natural sympathy with Chaos. But in Corum's worlds, the humanoid Vadhagh as the creations of Law tend towards good. The Mabden (humans), though creations of Chaos, are capable of both good and evil without the manipulations of the gods. In a letter to the fanzine Niekas in 1964, Moorcock said he took the idea of Law and Chaos being in conflict from the Zoroastrian cosmology, which describes a deity representing goodness and order (Ahura Mazda) in conflict with a deity representing evil and chaos (Ahriman). Chaos Chaos (disorder, entropy) expresses the principle of possibility unfettered by rules. In general, magic and sorcery draw on the powers of Chaos because they break the laws of nature. The effects of Chaos can be beautiful, but left unchecked, they become too disruptive for life. Symbol of Chaos Pure Chaos stuff manifests in Stormbringer and \\"The Dream of Earl Aubec\\". It is swirling, constantly changing, multicolored matter with the power to melt and twist anything with which it comes in contact, including living flesh. Mortals find the sight of pure Chaos disturbing. Ironically, a realm controlled by Chaos becomes stagnant: the state of constant change lacks meaning, and eventually all possibilities are exhausted. Corum encounters a similar state of nature when he visits the realm of Xiombarg in The Queen of the Swords. In Stormbringer, when Chaos takes over much of the world, Elric and his companions observe that the sun is motionless and time seems to stand still. Just as the Eternal Champion can be a servant of Law, though he is often more the servant of the balance, so Chaos also has its own champions. The most formidable is Prince Gaynor the Damned, formerly a servant of the Law but condemned by the Balance to aid Chaos after an unspeakable betrayal. He is completely hidden in shining armour that constantly changes hue from gold to silver to blue and so on, emblazoned with the symbol of Chaos – an image of eight arrows, radiating in all directions from a central point, to represent the many possibilities Chaos offers. Elric's sword Stormbringer is a Chaotic being, but not a god; it is powerful enough to slay Chaos Lords, and apparently feels no bond of sympathy with them. It is typical of Chaos to be at war with itself. =Lords of Chaos= The Chaos Lords have the powers of gods but the behaviour, and often the appearance, of demons. When they appear at their worst, they deliberately inflict pain and suffering on mortals for amusement; even at best, they are not concerned with the harmful effects of their creations. The Revenge of the Rose openly portrays Arioch as insane. Sorcerers often gain power by entering into diabolical pacts with Chaos Lords. Mortals who ally with Disorder gradually become misshapen or corrupt. Chaos Lords are sometimes restricted from acting directly against humans. In The Queen of the Swords, for instance, it is said that Xiombarg (as all the gods) is not permitted to strike directly against others unless they attack her, and must instead act through intermediaries. At other times, they may act without prohibition (as, for example, when Elric calls upon the aid of Arioch; the god may attack mortals without hesitation). Similar limitations are probably placed upon the Lords of Law. They are also restricted in their ability to move between planes. For instance, Arioch must be summoned by Elric before he can manifest on Earth. In the Elric series, there are many Chaos Lords, some more powerful than others, but the relationships between them is not always clear. In Corum's world, by contrast, there is a well-developed hierarchy of Chaos. The Fifteen Planes are divided into three groups of five planes, each governed by one of the three Sword Rulers, who are some of the \\"Old Gods\\": Arioch (\\"Knight of Swords\\"), Xiombarg (\\"Queen of Swords\\"), and Mabelode (\\"the Faceless\\", \\"King of Swords\\"). These gods also appear in the Elric series, but their character is slightly different. Arioch, the first Corum encounters, is the weakest of the three. He appears for much of the time as brutish, crude and direct, in contrast to his sophisticated, subtle nature as Elric's patron and perhaps less intelligent, though he also shows a different form to Corum. The crudity may be a result of interaction between him and the Mabden. Xiombarg appears as an unspeakably beautiful woman. She is more powerful and is more active in controlling and manipulating the planes under her control. However, when her anger is aroused, it leads to her downfall. Mabelode is most powerful of all. Much of his realm is constantly changing chaos-stuff. He appears as a literally faceless man bearing a golden sword. The Sword Rulers have vassals; it is possible that similar relationships exist between the deities in Elric's world though this is not made explicit. Arioch's vassals include Urleh, a minor god of Chaos serving the sophisticated Mabden (humans) of Lwyn-am-Esh; and the Dog and the Horned Bear, the savage beast-gods of the barbarians. A former priest of Urleh tells Corum that these gods are omnipotent and omniscient only over their spheres of influence; the Dog and the Bear are knowledgeable chiefly about Mabden affairs. Mabelode has a host of Dukes of Hell under him, but the only one named is Duke Teer. He has a vaguely pig-like head and takes great pride in his \\"Castle Built of Blood\\". Law Law provides order, structure, and justice to the world. Without it, nothing material could exist. Law appears friendly to life, but a realm controlled by Law alone becomes just as stagnant as one overrun by Chaos. In \\"To Rescue Tanelorn\\", the Realm of Law is a barren wasteland; without wrongs to right and injustice to correct, Law becomes meaningless. In The Dreamthief's Daughter, Law goes mad and tries to overrun the world. Ordinarily, however, Law is benevolent and beautiful in its perfect regularity. Symbol of Law During the time when most of the Eternal Champion cycle is set, Law is weak and is in fact banished from most mortal planes of existence. Elric must summon the White Lords to his plane by blowing the Horn of Fate. In Corum's realm, the destruction of first Arioch, then Xiombarg permits the return of Law. At the end, all gods are swept away leaving the races to make their own destinies. Besides the Eternal Champion, Law has servants who aid Law by advising the Champion or in other ways. Myshella, the Dark Lady of Kaneloon, Empress of the Dawn, is a servant of Law in Elric's world. She serves Law by tempting or guiding heroes to pit their wills against pure Chaos, by which process the lands of Earth are extended. In The Quest for Tanelorn, Hawkmoon comes upon a unique \\"Gathering of the Wise,\\" messengers of Law brought together from many planes. Present at the gathering are Sepiriz of Nihrain, who advises Elric in Stormbringer; Abaris of the Magi; Lamsar the Hermit, who guides Rackhir to the Grey Lords in \\"To Rescue Tanelorn\\"; the Warrior in Jet and Gold (who also appears in The Dragon in the Sword); Aleryon-a-Nyvish of the Temple of Law, a priest of Ilah in The Queen of the Swords; and the Silver Queen from Phoenix in Obsidian. The Symbol of Law is a single Arrow of Law. =Lords of Law= The White Lords of Law are much less developed than the Lords of Chaos. Most of the stories are set in a cosmic cycle when Chaos is most powerful. When they appear, the Lords of Law are usually more benevolent than the Chaos Lords, who are seductive – but also sinister, and prone to losing their temper. However, mortals who meet with the Lords of Law are wise to remember that what benefits the gods does not always suit the aims of mortals. Donblas is the only Lord of Law to appear in Elric's world. In Corum's world, there are three chief Lords of Law, corresponding to the three Sword Rulers. The first is Arkyn, counterpart to Arioch. When first met, his powers are weak and he has difficulty manifesting in Corum's plane and appears as an indistinct but tall figure. When his powers return, he appears as a gigantic (as tall as the sky) handsome figure. He is the creator of the Vadhagh, his favourite race. There is a brief reference to \\"Lord Shalod\\" (the ruler of the second five planes of the Corum mythos), presumably the counterpart to Xiombarg, but he is not described. A counterpart to Mabelode is not named. Like the Chaos Lords, the Lords of Law have their vassals. The only vassal deity of Law named is Ilah, a servant of Arkyn. The Cosmic Balance The Cosmic Balance maintains the balance of power between Law and Chaos by keeping both sides from overstepping the rules of war. It rarely manifests directly, but when it does (as in Stormbringer, The Queen of Swords, and The Quest for Tanelorn) it appears as a great pair of scales suspended in the sky. In The Queen of the Swords, it also manifests to pass judgment between two Lords of the Higher Worlds. The Balance is the power most beneficial to life, which needs a mixture of Law and Chaos to exist. It is also the agent of Fate. The Runestaff is a sentient object associated with the Balance, as Stormbringer is associated with Chaos. The Grey Lords appear in the story \\"To Rescue Tanelorn,\\" where it is said that they “are pledged neither to Law nor to Chaos, but will sometimes help either side if the whim takes them.” The Grey Lords take pride, ironically, in their humility. These purposefully neutral gods are gods of the Balance and caretakers of Tanelorn, the city of the Balance. Eternal Tanelorn exists in all planes of the Multiverse. It is neutral in the war between Law and Chaos, so it serves as a place of rest and retreat for tired heroes. As a general rule, they can only find the city after a long and difficult search. Its inhabitants are happy and productive because they are free to pursue their own interests instead of the desires of gods. People in Tanelorn feel intense peace. The fate of Law, Chaos, and the Balance is revealed in The Quest for Tanelorn, in which the history of one cycle of the Multiverse is concluded during the Conjunction of the Million Spheres. After defeating the sorcerers Agak and Gagak, Hawkmoon and Erekosë reach Tanelorn where they meet the Runestaff and Stormbringer in humanoid forms. Hawkmoon learns that the Black Sword and the Black Jewel are two aspects of the same creature. At the beginning of the Great Cycle, powerful smiths (the Chaos Engineers) created the Sword, the Jewel, the Runestaff, and finally the Balance to preserve Order between Law and Chaos, especially to limit the power of Stormbringer. Erekose takes up the Black Sword and destroys the Balance; then Hawkmoon smashes the Jewel with the Runestaff, which breaks. Thus, the last symbols of Authority are destroyed, leaving humanity free to make its own fate, but Erekose is also killed by the release of power. Hawkmoon is the last surviving incarnation of the Eternal Champion, and with all gods dead, his function as Champion is ended. The Sword Trilogy introduces two beings who are beyond even the balance, Kwll and Rhynn, also known as the \\"Lost Gods\\". The only thing that binds them is their brotherhood. In the King of Swords it is they who first destroy Mabelode and his Dukes of Hell, then the gods of Law as well. Cultural influences Law and Chaos in Michael Moorcock's fiction inspired the alignment system in Dungeons and Dragons. In Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, Law, Chaos and Neutral (Balance) are combined with Good, Evil and Neutral to create a total of nine alignments. Moorcock's conception of Chaos also heavily inspired Games Workshop in the creation of its Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000 fictional settings. Notably, however, they only briefly used Moorcock's conceptions of Order or the Balance. Pat Harrigan, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum (editors), Zones of Control: Perspectives on Wargaming. MIT Press, 2016 (p. 611) The descriptions of Chaos, of the eight-pointed star, of the Chaos Lords, the strange multicolored hues of energies, mutations and warping of matter and flesh, and so forth found in the Warhammer settings are all derived directly from Moorcock's works. The eight pointed star symbol is used by some writers on chaos magic.Condensed Chaos: Phil Hine, New Falcon Publications, 1995 See also * Chaos (Warhammer)  References  Category:Michael Moorcock's Multiverse ","title":"Law and Chaos"},{"id":"5039857","text":"St Mary and St Romuald is a Roman Catholic parish church in the parish of Yarm, North Yorkshire, England.

The expression shear flow is used to indicate: * a shear stress over a distance in a thin-walled structure (in solid mechanics);Higdon, Ohlsen, Stiles and Weese (1960), Mechanics of Materials, article 4-9 (2nd edition), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Library of Congress CCN 66-25222 * the flow induced by a force (in a fluid). In solid mechanics For thin-walled profiles, such as that through a beam or semi-monocoque structure, the shear stress distribution through the thickness can be neglected. Furthermore, there is no shear stress in the direction normal to the wall, only parallel. In these instances, it can be useful to express internal shear stress as shear flow, which is found as the shear stress multiplied by the thickness of the section. An equivalent definition for shear flow is the shear force V per unit length of the perimeter around a thin-walled section. Shear flow has the dimensions of force per unit of length. This corresponds to units of newtons per meter in the SI system and pound-force per foot in the US. = Origin = When a transverse force is applied to a beam, the result is variation in bending normal stresses along the length of the beam. This variation causes a horizontal shear stress within the beam that varies with distance from the neutral axis in the beam. The concept of complementary shear then dictates that a shear stress also exists across the cross section of the beam, in the direction of the original transverse force. As described above, in thin-walled structures, the variation along the thickness of the member can be neglected, so the shear stress across the cross section of a beam that is composed of thin-walled elements can be examined as shear flow, or the shear stress multiplied by the thickness of the element. = Applications = The concept of shear flow is particularly useful when analyzing semi-monocoque structures, which can be idealized using the skin-stringer model. In this model, the longitudinal members, or stringers, carry only axial stress, while the skin or web resists the externally applied torsion and shear force. In this case, since the skin is a thin-walled structure, the internal shear stresses in the skin can be represented as shear flow. In design, the shear flow is sometimes known before the skin thickness is determined, in which case the skin thickness can simply be sized according to allowable shear stress. Example of Skin Stringer Model with Shear Flow = Shear center = For a given structure, the shear center is the point in space at which shear force could be applied without causing torsional deformation (e.g. twisting) of the cross- section of the structure. The shear center is an imaginary point, but does not vary with the magnitude of the shear force - only the cross-section of the structure. The shear center always lies along the axis of symmetry, and can be found using the following method: # Apply an arbitrary resultant shear force # Calculate the shear flows from this shear force # Choose a reference point o an arbitrary distance e from the point of application of the load # Calculate the moment about o using both shear flows and the resultant shear force, and equate the two expressions. Solve for e # The distance e and the axis of symmetry give the coordinate for the shear center, independent of the shear force magnitude. = Calculating shear flow = By definition, shear flow through a cross section of thickness t is calculated using q=\\\\tau*t, where \\\\tau=\\\\frac{VQ}{It}. Thus the equation for shear flow at a particular depth in a particular cross-section of a thin-walled structure that is symmetric across its width is : q = \\\\frac{V_y Q_x}{I_x} where :q - the shear flow :Vy \\\\- the shear force perpendicular to the neutral axis x at the cross-section of interest :Qx \\\\- the first moment of area (aka statical moment) about the neutral axis x for the cross section of the structure above the depth in question :Ix \\\\- the second moment of area (aka moment of inertia) about the neutral axis x for the structure (a function only of the shape of the structure)  In fluid mechanics In fluid mechanics, the term shear flow (or shearing flow) refers to a type of fluid flow which is caused by forces, rather than to the forces themselves. In a shearing flow, adjacent layers of fluid move parallel to each other with different speeds. Viscous fluids resist this shearing motion. For a Newtonian fluid, the stress exerted by the fluid in resistance to the shear is proportional to the strain rate or shear rate. A simple example of a shear flow is Couette flow, in which a fluid is trapped between two large parallel plates, and one plate is moved with some relative velocity to the other. Here, the strain rate is simply the relative velocity divided by the distance between the plates. Shear flows in fluids tend to be unstable at high Reynolds numbers, when fluid viscosity is not strong enough to dampen out perturbations to the flow. For example, when two layers of fluid shear against each other with relative velocity, the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability may occur. Notes References *Riley, W. F. F., Sturges, L. D. and Morris, D. H.

The Richmond Symphony was founded in 1957. The Symphony performed only three concerts in its inaugural season. The Richmond Symphony Chorus, founded in 1971, gave its first performance under the direction of Robert Shaw; its directors have been Dr. James Erb (1971-2007) and Dr. Erin R. Freeman (since 2007). The Richmond Symphony Youth Orchestra Program includes four ensembles of elementary to secondary school students. As a nonprofit corporation, the Richmond Symphony is partially supported by the Virginia Commission for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. The orchestra performs five concert series: Masterworks, made up of new and traditional symphonic repertoire engaging some of the best classical guest artists in the industry; Metro Collection Series, made up of beloved chamber music and highlighting Richmond Symphony musicians as soloists in a more intimate setting; Pops, featuring popular guest artists and classical and pop repertoire; LolliPops, a family-friendly concert series; and Rush-Hour, one-hour casual concerts in the tasting room at Hardywood Park Craft Brewery. The Richmond Symphony also gives special concerts and tours throughout central, western and southern Virginia. In 2015 the Richmond Symphony launched its nationally recognized \\"Big Tent\\" initiative that brings concerts and festivals to communities throughout the Richmond region. As of December 2019, \\"Big Tent\\" community festivals have reached tens-of-thousands of audiences members, generating more than 150 community partnerships and helped to raise over $400,000 for the purchase of 363 instruments and in support of arts programming in Richmond Public Schools.

The film was voiced by Jonathan Winters, Ben Stein, Victoria Jackson, Mark DeCarlo and David Floyd. It is narrated by Don LaFontaine. Nods to other films, like a scene of ice-made AT-ST's, mostly resembling the ones from The Empire Strikes Back appear throughout. Plot The film features the loneliest Snowman. He has no friends and never learned to speak because nobody was around. Instead, his little flute was his voice. Every night, he played his flute for the stars. But one particular night, the stars shouted back. A flash of light zoomed past the Snowman and shattered his flute. Consumed with curiosity, the Snowman set off to find out what created the mysterious light. Eventually, the Snowman finds himself at Santa's Village. The Snowman enters a toy workshop, where elves were making toys. Another elf comes into the workshop. With him is the workshop owner: Santa Claus. While Santa is chatting with his elves, the Snowman finds a red and gold flute in the workshop. After grabbing the flute, an alarm goes off. The Snowman retreats, but Santa sends some of his elves to retrieve the flute. While being chased, the Snowman drops the flute, and hides from the elves by jumping off a cliff. He grabs an icicle stalactite, waiting for them to leave. After the elves retrieve the flute and return to the village, the Snowman heads home. The Snowman cannot stop thinking about Santa and his wonderful workshop. It seems that Santa has the perfect life: A marvelous home, many friends, plenty of toys, loved by everybody. But why wouldn't Santa let the Snowman have one little toy? It just didn't seem fair to the Snowman. The Snowman imagines himself as Santa, giving out toys, loved by everyone. At that moment, the Snowman thinks, \\"Why should Santa keep all that love, good tidings, and friendship for himself? That didn't seem fair. Maybe, it's time someone else got to be Santa?\\" And with that, the Snowman forms a sneaky plan to take Santa's spot. The Snowman sneaks into one of the village's attractions, where he is noticed, and kicked out. He comes up with another idea. He makes various equipment for invading the workshop, and snowman minions to help him. The Snowman changes from his usual self to a much more devious Snowman. The Snowman and his minions invade Santa's Village, but Santa sends his elves to fight back, in a chaotic battle. The elves attempt to melt and blow up the snowmen while the snowmen spew snowballs at the elves. Since Christmas was only hours away, Santa decides to help his elves end the conflict. The Snowman unleashes a snow monster - but Santa defeats it by using heat to shrink it. Just when it seems that Snowman is about to surrender, many more of his minions appear, greatly outnumbering Santa's forces. With that, Santa and his elves are imprisoned. The Snowman leaves to deliver toys, leaving Santa and the elves in an ice cage. However, an elf named Flippy comes to rescue them. Meanwhile, the Snowman soars above the rooftops. He sits in his snow replica of Santa's sleigh, while his minions act as his reindeer, feeling wonderful. Now, all he has to do is deliver a few toys, and everyone will love him. When the Snowman arrives at a little girl's house, Santa is making his way to the Snowman. The Snowman gives the girl an ice doll, but the doll shatters. Santa arrives and gives the girl a real doll. Instead of punishing the Snowman, Santa gives him the red and gold flute that the Snowman had attempted to steal, saying that the flute always belonged to him because Santa had accidentally shattered the first flute. Santa explains giving to the Snowman, saying, \\"Christmas giving isn't just for Santa. The spirit of giving is something that lives inside all of us.\\" As they are about to part ways, the Snowman discovers that his sleigh and his minions had melted from the heat of the little girl's chimney. Santa offers the Snowman a ride back home, and they become friends.

In 1988, the Rochester Manager Ed Piroli and Monaca Manager Tom Stoner made a bet signed with a handshake that gave the naming rights of the bridge to the winning team of that year.

He originally gained fame when he released his eponymously titled debut solo effort on Atlantic Records in 1988. The album was produced by Monroe Jones and David Tickle, and executive produced by future Interscope founder Jimmy Iovine. Although he had a top 40 hit with \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" in 1988 and also had a minor hit with \\"Drift Away\\" from The Wonder Years soundtrack, Spence was dropped from Atlantic before completing his second album in 1991. After several years of struggle, Spence's composition \\"The Power\\" was covered by both Amy Grant and Cher and was also used for a national Century 21 advertising campaign. Subsequently, he recorded the indie release \\"painfaithjoy\\" in 1995. He performed with Trisha Yearwood on the Oscar nominated song \\"How Do I Live Without You\\" in 1997 and sang live with her on the American Music Awards, The Tonight Show, The Oscars, and the CMA Awards. In 1999, he released his third solo album in Japan, titled I Guess I Love It before his record label, Pioneer Music Group closed its doors. That album was produced by former Eagle Bernie Leadon. In 2000, he toured with Trisha Yearwood. The following year, Wynonna Judd cut Judson's song \\"New Day Dawning\\", and it became the title track to her album. In 2003, Spence released two albums: The Velvet Kitten Sessions, which was a mainstream collection, and Opus Dei, which was a religious-themed effort.

She then served the Royal Navy until she was sold in 1808. Capture Gaité initially sailed from Bayonne to Rochefort. She then received the mission to carry passengers and supplies to Cayenne. Her mission completed, she proceeded to patrol the Antilles.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.191. At daybreak on 10 August 1797 44-gun Arethusa, under the command of Captain Thomas Wolley, was in the Atlantic Ocean at when she sighted three ships to windward. At 7:30 a.m. one of the ships bore down to within half-gunshot, and opened fire. She proved to be the 20-gun Gaieté, under the command of Enseigne de vaisseau Jean-François Guignier. She had been out of Cayenne about four weeks when she encountered Arethusa. With Gaieté having taken on a ship twice her size, there could only be one outcome. The British captured Gaieté within half an hour. She had sustained considerable damage to her sails and rigging, and lost two seamen killed and eight wounded, including Ensign Dubourdieu. Arethusa lost one seaman killed, and the captain's clerk and two seamen wounded. The French brig observed the engagement and then sailed away. The Royal Navy captured Espoir in September, in the Mediterranean. Royal Navy service Gaiete was commissioned into the Royal Navy in June 1798 under Commander Edward Durnford King for service in the North Sea. In 1799 she was serving in the Channel. On 4 March 1799 she sailed for Jamaica. She and the frigate Unite left Portsmouth as escorts to a convoy for the West Indies.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.345. Next, Gaiete captured the brig Rose on 7 April. Then on 11 January 1800 Gaiete captured the sloop Santa Christa. Between February and May 1800, Gaiete captured or detained several vessels: *schooner Speculator, 60 tons (bm), sailing from Guadeloupe to Copenhagen with a cargo of sugar and coffee (10 February); *ship Albion, of six guns and 500 tons (bm), sailing from Sunderland to Jamaica with a cargo of coals (retaken 16 February); *schooner Seaflower, of five men, sailing from Guadaloupe to Saint Thomas in ballast (18 February); *ship Daedalus, of six guns, 17 men, and 300 tons (bm), sailing from Deptford to Martinique with provisions for the government (retaken 28 February); *brig Good Fortune, of six men and 70 tons (bm), sailing from Liverpool, North America, to Antigua with a cargo of fish (retaken 5 March); *French schooner Success, of two guns, 60 men, and 60 tons (bm), sailing from Saint Bartholomew to Guadeloupe (6 March); *brig Renwick, 150 tons (bm), sailing from Norfolk, North America, to Antigua with a cargo of wheat and flour (captured 4 March and retaken 16 March); *schooner Betsey, of nine men and 69 tons (bm), sailing from Leghorn to Charlestown with a cargo of wine, oil, etc., (retaken 2 May); *schooner Elianne and Delphine (French tender), of ten men, sailing from Guadeloupe to Saint Bartholomew with a cargo of wine and sugar (6 May).

Peacocke received a promotion to post captain on 4 June 1801. In April 1802, Gaite was at Dominica with the 74-gun ships and , and the frigate to assist in suppressing a mutiny that had broken out on 9 April in the 8th West India Regiment. The soldiers had killed three officers, imprisoned the others, and taken over Fort Shirley. On the following day, HMS Magnificent, which was anchored in Prince Rupert's Bay under Captain John Giffard's command, sent a party of marines ashore to restore order. The mutineers fired upon Magnificent with no effect. On 12 April, Governor Cochrane entered Fort Shirley with the Royal Scots Regiment and the 68th Regiment of Foot. The rebels were drawn up on the Upper Battery of Fort Shirley with three of their officers as prisoners and presented arms to the other troops. They obeyed Cochrane's command to ground their arms but refused his order to step forward. The mutineers picked up their arms and fired a volley. Shots were returned, followed by a bayonet charge that broke their ranks and a close-range fire fight ensued. Those mutineers who tried to escape over the precipice to the sea were exposed to grape-shot and canister fire from Magnificent. Fate By 1807 Gaiete was in ordinary at Blackwall. The ship was offered for sale at Woolwich Dockyard on 8 July 1808, and sold on 21 July. Citations and references Citations References *Fonds Marine.

Plot of the play  The plot follows Smitty, a 17-year- old, after he is sentenced to six months in a youth reformatory. His cellmates are Rocky, a \\"dangerous and unpredictable\\" 19-year-old serving time for stealing a car from his male lover; Mona, an 18- or 19-year-old who is sentenced for making a homosexual pass at a group of boys; and Queenie, a flamboyant homosexual serving time for robbing an old woman. The only other character who appears onstage is a prison guard. Smitty, who asserts that he is heterosexual, seems to get along with his new cellmates quickly. Queenie, who has friends amongst the \\"politicians\\" of the prison, informs him of what to expect, and warns that Mona has been gang-raped because he did not have an \\"old man\\" looking out for him. Rocky later manipulates Smitty into becoming his sexual subordinate by threatening to arrange a similar treatment for him if he refuses. Smitty tries to make the best of his new situation, and he learns that Rocky knows a secret about the Guard taking a bribe and uses that secret to influence the guard as needed. Smitty also learns of further horrors to which uncooperative inmates can be subjected. Queenie encourages Smitty to beat up Rocky and spread the news so he can win a better protector from amongst the \\"politicians\\" in the guard house; Queenie makes this suggestion for his own benefit rather than Smitty's. At Christmas time, the inmates prepare to perform in a pageant. Queenie has planned a drag act, and Mona intends to read Shakespeare. Mona's act is rejected at the last minute, and Smitty uses the information he knows to get the guard to leave him alone with Mona while everyone else attends the show. Mona admits he was falsely accused of the crime for which he is serving time, and Smitty admits unhappiness that Queenie is now choosing his lovers for him. Smitty makes an offer to become Mona's \\"old man\\", which Mona refuses. Smitty becomes upset, but Mona comforts him with Shakespeare's poem When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes. The two are laughing and embracing when Rocky and Queenie return from the pageant: Rocky and Queenie immediately begin to beat Mona, accusing him of making a sexual advance on Smitty. The Guard takes Mona away to be tortured, despite Smitty's pleas. Angrily, Smitty threatens both Queenie and Rocky, establishing himself as the new dominant male in the cell. The play ends with Smitty listening to Mona's punishment offstage and swearing to \\"pay them back\\".John Herbert, Fortune and Men's Eyes. Grove Press, New York, 1967. History The title of the play comes from William Shakespeare's Sonnet 29, which begins with the line, \\"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes...\\". It has been translated into 40 languages and produced in over 100 countries. It is the most published Canadian play, and won the Dominion Drama Festival's Massey Award in 1968 (an award which Herbert refused) and the Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award in 1975. Fortune and Men's Eyes was inspired in part by Herbert's own experience. In the 1940s, he was attacked outside a gay bar while dressed in drag and then convicted of indecency based on the testimony of his attackers. Following the conviction, he was imprisoned in a youth reformatory.John Herbert at the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia. The character of Queenie in the play is an authorial self-insertion. Herbert encountered difficulties in getting the play staged. After being rejected by several directors, Herbert, on the recommendation of Robertson Davies, who frequented the University Club at which Herbert worked as a waiter, sent the script to Douglas Campbell at the Stratford Festival.\\"That Man's Scope: John Herbert now\\". The Body Politic, Vol 10 (1973). Campbell accepted the play for the festival's young actors workshop and assigned it to Bruno Gerussi to direct, but the Stratford Festival's board of directors forbade the production from being staged publicly. Herbert sent a copy of Fortune and Men's Eyes to renowned Canadian theatre critic Nathan Cohen, who replied, \\"I hope you understand that there's not a chance in the world of this getting a professional production in Canada. I've taken the liberty of sending it to a producer of my acquaintance in New York and, of course, promise nothing.\\" Cohen recommended the play to Broadway press agent David Rothenberg, who in turn recommended it to Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman workshopped the play at the New York Actors Studio in 1966, taking the role of Rocky, while Jon Voight played Smitty. The play, produced by Rothenberg, premiered off-Broadway in New York City at the Actors Playhouse from February 23, 1967 to January 1968. Reviews were mixed, and many reviewers were shocked by the subject matter. Reviewer Herbert Whittaker wrote in The Globe and Mail that the play was \\"the art of washing our dirty linen in the neighbor's yard.\\" Cohen wrote in the Toronto Star that the play \\"lifts the carpet and shows what is underneath\\"; he added that it \\"asks deeply disturbing questions about long-established personal and social assumptions. It does not enrich our vision. It undermines it\\". Fortune and Men's Eyes inspired the creation of the Fortune Society, a New York City- based advocacy and support organization for former prisoners. The play toured to Chicago, San Francisco, Montreal, and Toronto. In 1969, the play was produced and directed by Sal Mineo at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. Don Johnson played the lead role of Smitty and Michael Greer played the role of Queenie, Smitty's cellmate. Mineo took the role of Rocky. This production garnered more critical approval, but included additional scenes which had not been approved by Herbert.Michaud, Michael Gregg. Sal Mineo: A Biography. Crown Archetype: New York.

The first short, Thumb Wars, was created as a television special and spawned the rest of the series. Each filmette is available on DVD, with exclusive extra footage on the Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature. The entire series is available in a box set called \\"All Thumbs\\", which does not include the Double Feature or \\"The Thumbersons\\" short. Most of the shorts have aired on Cartoon Network, before the show or film being parodied air, such as Thumb Wars (for Star Wars: The Clone Wars) and Bat Thumb (for airings of Batman and Robin). \\"Franken thumb\\" aired around Halloween 2008 and was released on DVD on October 24, 2009. \\"Blair Thumb\\" aired in Halloween 2009. It is currently unknown when \\"Thumbtanic\\" and \\"The Godthumb\\" will air. Filmettes right * Thumb Wars: The Phantom Cuticle was a 29-minute 1999 parody of the Star Wars movie series. * The Godthumb was a 2001 parody of The Godfather. The short film followed the Godthumb, a leader of a Mafia family and his four sons. * Bat Thumb was a 2001 adaptation of the Batman movie series. This 30 minute film combines elements of the classic Batman TV series with Adam West with more recent Batman movie elements. * Frankenthumb was a 32-minute animated film. The story changed the characters of Frankenstein slightly to Dr. Frankenthumb, Humpy (Igor) and \\"Pepper\\" (aka Frankenstein's Monster). Frankenthumb was released in the US in 2002. * The Blair Thumb (2002) was a short film parody of the movie The Blair Witch Project. * Thumbtanic was 26 minutes in length, and featured a parody of the theme song from the 1997 movie Titanic, called My Heart is a Thumb.

Sayers. Unlike Sayers's better-known creation, Lord Peter Wimsey, Egg does not actively pursue investigations. Usually, he is witness to the discovery of a murdered body, or links a casual observation with a recent newspaper headline proclaiming some crime. He is, in his own words, 'Monty-on-the-spot'. The plots are typically neat puzzles with less personal content than the Wimsey stories, although Egg himself emerges as a memorable and likeable character. A novel would probably not have fitted the nature of the Egg stories. By occupation, Egg is a travelling salesman for an importer and distributor of fine wines and spirits (Wimsey is a well-known connoisseur of the same). His knowledge of all aspects of the vintner's trade is useful in determining the exact circumstances of several cases of poisoning. Through regular contact with other commercial travellers, he has also gained a smattering of knowledge of several other lines of business: enough, for example, to determine (in \\"A Shot at Goal\\") that a threatening letter was written by someone connected with the printing trade rather than by a garage mechanic with a grievance, from a peculiarity of the handwriting. Egg is described (in \\"One Too Many\\") as a fair-haired, well-mannered young man, and elsewhere as being slightly portly also. He is not mentioned as being married, or having any romantic attachments or inclinations. He has a habit of quoting maxims from The Salesman's Handbook, 'his favourite book', such as: :A cheerful voice and cheerful look :put orders in the order-book. He frequently fortifies himself at various stages in criminal investigations by falling back on these proverbs. He even invents such rhymes for future reference; for example, in \\"Murder at Pentecost\\" he makes up and memorises \\"To call an Oxford man an undergrad, proclaims you a bounder and a cad\\", to ensure he does not contravene an obscure point of University etiquette (\\"undergrad\\" vs the more acceptable \\"undergraduate\\"). Egg periodically expresses admiration for the up- to-date, and in \\"Murder in the Morning\\" comments, of a prefabricated garage: \\"That's the stuff.... Standardisation means immense saving in labour, time, expense.\\" He also uses the commercial clichés of the time. All this gives an impression somewhat different from Lord Peter Wimsey, and there may be an element of deliberate contrast. Sayers had a profound knowledge of the advertising world, as evidenced in Murder Must Advertise, and the milieu of Egg is derivable from this expertise and knowledge.

Naoshige proved himself in battle as he led forces of Ryūzōji Takanobu. In 1570, Naoshige assisted Takanobu while at Saga Castle when it was surrounded by a 60,000-man Ōtomo clan army. However, Naoshige had only 5,000 troops, so he suggested a night raid on the enemies camp which successfully routed them. In 1575, he attacked Suko Castle in western Hizen and forced its commander, Hirai Tsuneharu, to commit suicide. Later career Portrait of Naoshige as warlord (Kōden-ji) Naoshige was the chief retainer for the daimyo of Hizen in 1584 when Takanobu died.

Naoshige also assisted Takanobu during the Battle of Okitanawate but was unable to prevent their rout which later ended in Takanobu's death.

Neptune itself is seen in the season 3 episode \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\", as well as in the direct-to-DVD movie \\"Bender's Big Score\\". * In the Japanese Anime Urusei Yatsura, Neptune is an icy, cold place which is the home of Oyuki, one of Lum's childhood alien friends. * In Space Patrol (1962) - episode The Slaves of Neptune, the crew of the Galasphere are sent to solve the mystery of a spaceship sending colonists to Pluto which disappeared near Neptune. On approach to Neptune Dart, Slim and Husky fall under the hypnotic influence of Neptunian overlord Tyro who is using his powers to trap Earth colonists as slaves. * In Grant Morrison's DC One Million (1998), each planet of the Solar System is overseen by a member of the future descendants of the Justice League. Neptune is overseen by the Aquaman of the 853rd century, and is described as being covered in oceans. * In 1975, the Mego Corporation created an eight-inch \\"Neptunian\\" action figure doll for its first line of \\"Star Trek Aliens.\\" Although elaborately designed as a monstrous reptilian with a long, thin head, a scaly green-and-red jumpsuit (with wings sewn under each arm), and removable, reptilian, plastic green gloves and boots, the Neptunian is particularly noteworthy because it never appeared in any Star Trek TV episode or movie, before or since. *In All-Star Comics #13 the Justice Society of America are gassed by Nazis and sent to different planets. Dr. Mid-Nite lands on Neptune, an ice-covered planet with some sort of a man-built communications system on the surface. He is met by several creatures and taken to meet Hydara, ruler of the subterranean people and made a slave. Just then, a person runs in and states that he has caught the dreaded plague that has been killing off his people. Dr. Mid-Nite deduces that they merely have the measles, which he can easily cure. He asks for herbs and makes a solution that the people can absorb through their feet-roots. As a reward, he is given a complete set of books describing their secrets of plant growth and surgical work. *In Marvel Family #27 Neptune is shown to be inhabited by a race of robots that use 'sounds' for currency. Cap meets a Neptunian who wants to capture a human for his freak show. Radio waves from Billy Batson's show are picked up by the ship and a device is activated that pulls him towards the ship. Billy summons Captain Marvel and easily defeats the Neptunians. He then foolishly turns back, thinking the Neptunians won't be scared of him. However he is hit on the head, and knocked out by the robot. The unconscious Billy is securely tied up and gagged. He finds himself in a cage with a cover on him. He gets the loose end of his gag on the cover and when it is pulled away his gag is pulled off. He transforms and the Neptunians think he is not human, but a robot due to his invulnerability. He flies the owner away from the mob and tells him not to exhibit people because they look different. However the robot then finds a Chink-Chink, a tortoise-like creature that makes that sound and takes it back with him, hoping to exhibit it. *In Marvel Family #36 all life on Neptune is wiped out by the Invaders from Infinity (see List of Captain Marvel (DC Comics) enemies), who want to systematically destroy all forms of matter so they have more space to move in. Although never actually seen, it appears an outpost on Pluto is manned by Neptunians, who appear humanoid. The Neptunians are advanced enough to contact Earth. When the Marvels go to Neptune, they find holes, and think the Neptunians must have been a mole-like race. The Neptunians are avenged when the Invaders are imprisoned and destroyed. *In July 1958 Superman journeys to Neptune to obtain a sculpture of himself sculpted by the Neptunians in his honor. The sculpture is one of a series of so-called \\"space trophies\\" which the Man of Steel gathers for inclusion in a time capsule which the Metropolis Museum plans to bury in the ground as a gift for the people of the fiftieth century A.D. (Superman #122/1: \\"The Secret of the Space Souvenirs\\"). *In Marvel Family #16 it is revealed the mightiest being on Neptune is an octopus-like creature. He is kidnapped by a Plutonian tyrant to fight the mightiest beings of other planets, but is beaten by Captain Marvel. * The Gobsmacking Galaxy, an entry in the children's non- fiction series The Knowledge written by Kjartan Poskitt, humorously describes hypothetical alien life forms which might evolve on planets in the solar system; the extreme cold of Neptune precludes any actual physical body, so the Neptunian creature is a being of pure electromagnetic energy, gamma rays and photons, while the Triton creature would be the same, except wearing an anorak to cope with the slightly lower temperature.

The song is a collaboration with musician Robert Smith, frontman of the English rock band The Cure. Lyrically, the song is inspired by a story from producer Jerry Finn's adolescence, in which he was humiliated by a girl he had fallen in love with. The song was frequently cited as a highlight on the album and received positive reviews. \\"All of This\\" was briefly considered to be the album's fifth single, but the idea was shelved when the band broke up in 2005. Background The song is a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith, pictured here in 2004. \\"All of This,\\" as well as the song it segues from, \\"Easy Target,\\" were based on a story from producer Jerry Finn's middle school years. Finn was in love with a female classmate, Holly, who invited him over, only to have her and her friend drench him with a hose; humiliated, he rode home on his bicycle. The song was musically inspired by The Cure song \\"The Love Cats\\" (as was \\"I Miss You\\"), and the band decided to reach out to The Cure frontman Robert Smith by phone. The trio did not anticipate he would go for it, considering the band's reputation. Smith, for his part, was bemused as to how he would fit into Blink-182's sound: \\"I'd heard a couple of singles,\\" he later told Blender, \\"but I couldn't really see how I could sing on anything or write any words. But the demos for the album that eventually came out were fantastic. I think they suffer in a way that we [The Cure] suffered in that people weren't allowing them to become something else. If another band put that new CD out as their first album, people would go crazy.\\"Shooman, 2010. p. 124 As for their legitimacy, Smith gave the band advice: \\"Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I really like the music you sent me.\\" Hoppus was ecstatic at Smith's response; he referred to the call as \\"an amazing experience, like a dream come true.\\" Hoppus had been significantly influenced by The Cure in his adolescence. After borrowing a cassette version of the band’s album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin, he became fixated on \\"Just Like Heaven”, in high school, he began to dress like frontman Robert Smith, donning eyeliner and \\"occasionally bright red lipstick\\" to his high school classes. During the session that produced \\"All of This,\\" Hoppus went out of his way to purchase a Fender six- string bass, the same model employed on The Cure song \\"Push\\".Shooman, 2010. p. 123 Smith, who recorded his parts in England, took a significant amount of time recording the song, to the point that the band was unsure of whether or not his contribution would make the record. \\"We were literally hours from having to turn [the masters] in to the factory when it showed up,\\" said DeLonge. \\"It gave us all goose bumps to hear Robert's voice on our record, to hear his voice on another song, and to come to the realization that we actually wrote the music to it, because it sounds like a Cure song. We were jumping for joy when it was all said and done.\\" Music The song is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from A3 to C#5. \\"All of This\\" is a gothic-tinged pop song that uses strings and guitar effects to create a moody atmosphere. Reception Entertainment Weekly Leah Greenblatt called the song a \\"haunting paean to lost love,\\" and Nick Catucci of The Village Voice referred to it as a \\"shuffling, string-gilded slow burner,\\" while opining that Smith \\"has more presence than both of Blink's singers combined.\\" A.D. Amorosi of The Philadelphia Inquirer cited \\"All of This\\" as an example of the band delve into new wave. Trevor Kelley of Alternative Press considered it evocative of the Cure's Seventeen Seconds. The band had discussions as to whether issue \\"All of This\\" as the fifth single from Blink-182, but plans were dropped following the band's declaration of an 'indefinite hiatus' in February 2005. In response to the idea of \\"All of This\\" becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked \\"We would love it because it's a bad-ass song, and The Cure's Robert Smith sings on it, and that makes us cooler than everybody else.\\" Personnel ;Blink-182 * Mark Hoppus – vocals, bass guitar, double bass * Tom DeLonge – vocals, guitar * Travis Barker – drums, percussion ;Additional musicians * Robert Smith – vocals ;Production * Jerry Finn – producer * Tom Lord-Alge – mix engineer * Brian Gardner – mastering engineer References * Notes External links * Category:Blink-182 songs Category:2003 songs Category:Songs written by Mark Hoppus Category:Songs written by Tom DeLonge Category:Songs written by Travis Barker Category:Songs written by Robert Smith (musician) ","title":"All of This"},{"id":"5040247","text":"is a railway station on the Rikuu East Line in the city of Ōsaki, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East).

This is commonly implemented in C++ as callbacks. Other object-oriented languages, such as Java and C#, have built-in support for sinks by allowing events to be fired to delegate functions. Due to lack of formal definition, a sink is often misconstrued with a gateway, which is a similar construct but the latter is usually either an end-point or allows bi-direction communication between dissimilar systems, as opposed to just an event input point . This is often seen in C++ and hardware-related programming , thus the choice of nomenclature by a developer usually depends on whether the agent acting on a sink is a producer or consumer of the sink content.

Founded in 1876, it closed in 1941, the name of the magazine having been changed several times in the interim. Background The Wasp was founded as a weekly satire magazine in San Francisco in 1876 by the Bohemian expatriate Francis Korbel and his two brothers, who also founded the Korbel Champagne Cellars. The first issue was published on August 5, 1876. The lead artist until 1883 was George Frederick Keller. The magazine was somewhat unusual at the time, owing to the Korbels' expertise in mass-producing color lithographs in print, a process they had come to master in their first business, the manufacture of labeled cigar boxes. The magazine was sold in secret in 1881 to Charles Webb Howard, who hired Edward C. Macfarlane as publisher. Ambrose Bierce was hired as editor soon afterward, serving in that role from January 1, 1881, until September 11, 1885. During Bierce's editorial tenure, The Wasp published his column \\"Prattle\\" and several serialized installments of his satirical definitions later collected as The Devil's Dictionary. Political cartoons from The Wasp are often cited in Asian-American anti-defamation materials as an example of early stereotyping of Chinese immigrants. With the following name changes, the magazine ran from August 5, 1876, to April 25, 1941:Edward E.

Education and career Born on April 11, 1811, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Drake attended St. Joseph's College in Bardstown, Kentucky in 18323 and 1824, and Partridge's Military Academy in Middletown, Connecticut in 1824 to 1825. He was a midshipman in the United States Navy from 1827 to 1830. He read law with Benjamin Drake in Cincinnati. He entered private practice in Cincinnati from 1833 to 1834. He continued private practice in St. Louis, Missouri from 1834 to 1847, then returned to Cincinnati from 1847 to 1849. He was treasurer of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in 1849. He resumed private practice in St. Louis from 1850 to 1867. He was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives from 1859 to 1860. He was a delegate and Vice President of the Missouri constitutional convention in 1865. Leader of Radical Republicans During the American Civil War, Drake became a fierce opponent of slavery, and a leader of the Radical Republicans. From 1861 to 1863, he proposed without success the immediate and uncompensated emancipation of slaves. He was defeated by the conservative Republicans led by Governor Hamilton Rowan Gamble and supported by Lincoln. By 1863, Drake had organized his Radical faction and called for immediate emancipation, a new constitution, and a system of disfranchisement of all Confederate sympathizers in Missouri. He served as vice president of the 1865 state constitutional convention, where he stood out as the most active leader. Missouri German leader Carl Schurz commented about him, \\"in politics he was inexorable ... most of the members of his party, especially in the country districts, stood much in awe of him.\\" The new Constitution was adopted and became known as the \\"Drake constitution.\\" The Radicals maintained absolute control of the state from 1865 to 1871, with Drake as their leader. To maintain power, Drake and the Radical Republicans disfranchised every man who had supported the Confederacy, even indirectly. They made an 81-point checklists of actions. The United States Supreme Court reversed the imposition of the oath on ministers, and became a highly controversial political issue across the state. The German Republicans in particular were angry.Martha Kohl, \\"Enforcing a Vision of Community: The Role of the Test Oath in Missouri's Reconstruction.\\" Civil War History 40.4 (1994): 292-307. To further bolster his voting base, he secured the franchise for all black men in Missouri, despite qualms held by many Republicans. Congressional service Drake was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1867, to December 19, 1870, when he resigned to accept a federal judicial position. He served as Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Education for the 41st United States Congress. Federal judicial service Drake was nominated by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 12, 1870, to the Chief Justice seat on the Court of Claims (later the United States Court of Claims) vacated by Chief Justice Joseph Casey. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 12, 1870, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on December 12, 1885, due to his resignation. Later career and death Following his resignation from the federal bench, Drake resumed private practice in Washington, D.C. from 1885 to 1892. He died on April 1, 1892, in Washington, D.C. His remains were cremated and the ashes interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.  Family  Drake's father, Daniel Drake (1785–1852), was an American physician and author. His uncle, Benjamin Drake (1795–1841), was an American historian, editor, and writer. Works  References Further reading * Astor, Aaron.

They are affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood and the Ku Klux Klan. Their allies are Nazi Lowriders and Volksfront. Parole and probation officers report the gang may have swelled from a handful of members less than a decade ago to around 350 now. EK members have a propensity for violence and are one of the most powerful gangs within the Oregon Department of Corrections. The group was founded in 1998 by David Patrick Kennedy and another inmate of Eastern Oregon's Snake River Correctional Institution. Membership in the EK is nearly exclusively male, and membership is restricted to those with no more than one-sixteenth Native American ancestry. The group has a formal structure, rules, and ritual. It is highly secretive. The gang has a reputation for extortion, assaults, moving contraband goods throughout the Oregon correctional institutions, and dog fighting. New members are encouraged to \\"earn their bones\\" (their membership) through hostile action consistent with the group's cause. A 2016 BBC documentary show entitled \\"A Black and White Killing\\" focused on the trial (and eventual conviction) of an EK gang member accused of the murder of a young black man. The documentary interviewed an ex-gang member, who stated that EK operates an unbreakable policy of 'Blood in, Blood out'. This rule requires that all potential new gang members must 'shed blood' as a condition of entry to the gang, typically in directed attacks made against members of rival gangs ('blood in'). The former member went on to explain that an attempt to leave the gang is seen as a betrayal of the 'brotherhood' of all remaining gang members - even those who are members of other gangs. The price for attempting to leave the gang, once inducted, is one's life. The spilling of the deserting gang member's blood (during their subsequent murder) constitutes the requirement for 'blood out'. There is no documented information indicating EK members attack prison guards. On the street EK members appear to be involved in the distribution and possibly manufacture of methamphetamine. EK members mark their membership with the initials EK in a shield on their right calf or on other parts of their bodies. Women are associated with the group, but are marked with the initials FW. The initials represent prison slang: F stands for \\"feather\\", prison slang for female, and W stands for \\"wood\\", prison slang for a caucasian. Released members are attempting to recruit new young members both in prisons, jails and on the street. According to the Portland Tribune, EK members claim that they use high schools in the Portland, Oregon area to find new recruits. In 2002, a county grand jury indicted Joshua Robert Brown, a 21-year-old, on charges of killing Anthony Cleo Wilson, a 47-year-old African-American. Joshua Robert Brown joined European Kindred in 2000 while serving a four-year sentence for robbery. After 3 weeks from being released, police claimed that Brown stabbed Wilson to death. Authorities say Brown's motive may have been that Wilson, who'd been busted for possession and manufacture of narcotics, sold him some bad or phony drugs, but they also believe it may have been a hate crime. On August 10, 2016, European Kindred member Russell Courtier, 38, egged on by his girlfriend Colleen Hunt, 35, used his 1991 Jeep Wrangler to run over 19-year- old African-American Larnell Bruce. This incident occurred after Larnell propelled Russell’s head into a window causing a concussion. Larnell Bruce then walked off after the encounter at Gresham, Oregon 7-11. Security cameras showed the teen attempting to avoid the jeep and escape before being hit. The police arrived after receiving a call from an employee of the 7-11 about the incident and found the teen bleeding, critically injured and lying in the street. Trials were eventually completed in March 2019. On March 13, Hunt pled guilty to manslaughter. Six days later, Courtier was convicted of murder and hate crime.

Born in Radlow, Galicia, Austrian Empire, he travelled widely, first to Germany, France, the Balkans, and Turkey, to Egypt and the Sudan. Upon his return to Germany and later to Austria, he published several books on the geography, ethnic groups and political conditions of the historic Sudan in the 1870s and 1880s. His historical photographs, taken mainly in southern Sudan, are regarded as the earliest photographs of ethnic people living along the White Nile and beyond.  Life and travels  In 1877, Buchta arrived at Khartoum, where Charles George Gordon, then Governor-General of the Turkish-Egyptian Sudan, facilitated his onward journey to Emin Pasha at Ladó, on the Upper Nile. From there, he travelled further along the White Nile as far as northern Uganda, taking some of the earliest existing photographs of ethnic people in these regions, such as the Acholi, Bari, Zande, Shilluk or Dinka. Upon his return to Germany in 1881, he published his impressions along with 160 mounted albumen prints in the book Die obern Nilländer: Volkstypen und Landschaften. (in English: The Lands of the Upper Nile: Ethnic people and Landscapes). In 1885, he undertook another voyage through Egypt and the desert to Fayum. He was also a collaborator on the first volume of Wilhelm Junker's work Travels in Africa: During the years 1875-1878.  Importance for early photography in Africa  Historical photograph of Shaigiya woman in Sudan, by Richard Buchta, around 1878 Many of his photographs have been used for anthropological studies and are kept in different collections in Oxford, UK, such as the Pitt Rivers Museum, as well as in the collections of the Museum of Ethnology, in Vienna. Even though his photographs were frequently reproduced by travel writers of Eastern Africa of the time, his work was largely forgotten in the 20th century. In the context of studies on the history of photography in Africa, however, the importance of Buchta's visual records and their influence on late 19th century anthropological studies on Eastern Africa have gained new attention. On the occasion of an exhibition of his photographs in 2015, the Pitt Rivers Museum wrote: \\"His journey into Equatoria Province (now parts of South Sudan and northern Uganda) shaped the visual representation of its peoples in European literature for a generation, being celebrated and reproduced, mostly in engraved form, by all the major explorer-writers of central Africa in the period.\\"  Selected works (in German)  * Die obern Nilländer, Volkstypen und Landschaften, with 160 photographic views (1881) * Der Sudan und der Mahdi, Das Land, die Bewohner und der Aufstand (1884) * Der Sudan unter ägyptischer Herrschaft (1888)  Further reading  * Robert Brown (1893) The story of Africa and its explorers, Cassell & Co., London * David Killingray and Andrew Roberts: An Outline History of Photography in Africa to ca. 1940.

The magazine looked at big ideas in science, important issues at the intersection of science and society, and the people driving global science culture. Seed was founded in Montreal by Adam Bly and the magazine was then headquartered in New York with bureaus around the world. May/June 2009 (Issue No. 22) was the last print issue. Content continued to be published on the website until its demise. Seed was a finalist for two National Magazine Awards in 2007 in the categories of Design and General Excellence (100,000 to 250,000), was the recipient of the Utne Independent Press Award, and was included in the 2006 Best American Science and Nature Writing anthology published by Houghton Mifflin and edited by Brian Greene. The magazine published original writing from scientists and science journalists. Scientists who contributed to the magazine include: James D. Watson, Freeman Dyson, Lisa Randall, Martin Rees, Steven Pinker, E.O. Wilson, and Daniel Dennett. Seed's design direction was created by Stefan Sagmeister. Jonah Lehrer also contributed features to Seed. History Bly's first incursion into media came in 2000, when he launched an online magazine, the Journal of Young Scientists (www.joysnet.com). He was previously a researcher at Canada's National Research Council. JoYS shared Seed's focus on the roles of science in many aspects of society, as well as its emphasis on design. Nobel laureate Leon M. Lederman was among the senior scientists who contributed to the magazine. Founding the media group SEED Group, based in Montreal and funded privately, Bly started Seed's publication in Canada in November 2001. The magazine focused on the meeting of science and culture at its inception: Bly's first editor's note declared that \\"SEED defines the science of contemporary urban culture\\". In additional interviews, he explained that the magazine would connect to the reader by showing the widespread applications of science, as well as giving faces to \\"the people behind science\\" by placing people on the covers. The first issue had a circulation of 105,000 within the U.S. and Canada; popular science writer Matt Ridley was among the contributors. Seed described its design as \\"science couture\\", with many pages where graphics dominated text. The first cover featured a nude male-female couple and included pieces themed around birth. The Boston Globe described two interior pages in which \\"Above a pacifier image is an essay on fluids and engineering with curves. A purple balloon floats above a few sentences about the expanding universe.\\" High fashion also permeated the magazine's advertising, which included \\"Hugo Boss, Kaluha, Evian, Club Monaco, Absolut Citron, Kenzo, [and] Skechers\\" in the first issue; The Christian Science Monitor described the juxtaposition of the graphic design as \\"often making it difficult to tell where the journalism ends and the sales pitches begin\\". The first issue received coverage in both Science and Nature. The final issue was published in February 2012, with no issues between May 2011 and February 2012.Magazine Archives Features The magazine was laid out in sections, each separated by a portfolio of science photography: *Notebook - front section containing a mix of news, op-art, opinions, interviews and articles, and columns by Chris Mooney (Politics), PZ Myers (Pharyngula) and Mara Hvistendahl (Asia). *Incubator - summary of innovative scientific ideas. This section also contained each month's Cribsheet; \\"SEED's tear-outable tool for living in the 21st Century\\", a series of small posters each summarizing a scientific field, printed on heavy card stock. The series was also available for free download on SEED's website in GIF and PDF formats.Seed: Cribsheet *Features - included profiles, essays, photoessays, investigations and fiction. This section also contained the regular feature Seed Salon, which transcribed a conversation between a scientist and an artist or humanist. *Reviews - a guide to global science culture; included reviews and critiques of books, exhibits, plays, films, museums and art *Laboratory - The back page captured science conducted in unexpected places.

It features an unnamed misfit who relates better to rats than to humans. It was the basis for the 1971 film Willard, its 1972 sequel Ben, and the 2003 remake of the original film. After the release of the original film, the book was re- released and re-titled Willard. Plot The book is set as a series of journal entries, where the unnamed narrator goes back and forth between his life with the rats and his work, in a low-level job at a company that his father used to own. In these entries, the young man dwells on the hatred he feels for his boss, the stresses of caring for his aging mother, a nameless girl he becomes fond of and above all the families of rats which he has befriended and which he uses for company and companionship. Eventually, the young man trains the rats to do things for him. His favorite is an Agouti Berkshire rat (normal wild rat color, only with white markings on the belly, who in the film adaptations was portrayed as a white rat) which he calls \\"Socrates\\". A rival to Socrates is \\"Ben\\", a large rat that the narrator grows to despise when it refuses to listen to him. The young man uses the rats to wreak revenge upon his boss and havoc among the local shop owners and home owners, whom he has robbed with the aid of his rats. His \\"ratman\\" robberies become a newspaper sensation in the area and the man makes quite a stash of money for himself and for the girl he is courting at work. After his mother dies, the young man inherits the house. When Socrates is killed at the young man's workplace by his boss Mr. Jones, he is forced to use Ben in his criminal escapades. He devises a plan to have the rats kill Mr. Jones, avenging Socrates' death. He then abandons all the rats at the scene of the crime, ridding himself of that part of his life. Eventually, as his relationship with the office girl moves towards marriage, Ben and his colony return, chasing the girl out of the house and trapping the young man in the attic. The book ends with the young man madly scribbling about the rats gnawing away at the attic door.

He was the son of Đurađ II and Jelena Lazarević.  Reign  In April 1403, the seventeen-year- old Balša became the ruler of Zeta when his father Đurađ II died as a result of the injuries he had suffered at the Battle of Tripolje. As he was young and inexperienced, his main advisor was his mother, Jelena, a sister of the ruler of Serbia at the time, Stefan Lazarević. Under the influence of his mother, Balša reverted the order of the state religion, passing a law declaring Orthodox Christianity as the official confession of the state, while Catholicism became a tolerant confession. Balša waged a 10-year war against Venice, the First Scutari War. In 1405, Ulcinj, Bar and Budva were seized by the Venetians. Balša then became a vassal to the Ottoman Turks. In 1409, however, Venice had purchased the rights to Dalmatia from King Ladislaus of Naples and began fighting for control of Dalmatian cities. After a huge effort, Balša seized Bar from the Venetians in 1412. Venice, pressed with difficulties, had no choice but to agree to return territories it had previously seized. In 1413 he built a church dedicated to Saint Nicholas in Praskvica Monastery. According to a chapter Balša issued in 1417 he was probably a ktitor of the Moračnik Monastery. Possessions of Venice and Balša III. Balša had waged a new war against Venice, which was connected to the war with the Hungarians and the Turks. In 1418, he conquered Shkodër from the Venetians, but lost Budva and Luštica with its salt works. In the next year, 1419, he made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Budva. He went to Belgrade to ask for aid from Stefan Lazarević, but never returned to Zeta. In 1421, before his death and under the influence of his mother, he passed the rule of Zeta to his uncle, Despot Stefan Lazarević.  Marriage and issue  In 1407 Balša III married Mara, a daughter of Niketa Thopia. In his second marriage, Balša III married Bolja, a daughter of Koja Zaharia, in 1412 or at the beginning of 1413.Albanološki institut u Prištini 1968 p. 125: \\"Poznato je takođe da se Balša III krajem 1412 ili početkom 1413 godine oženio u drugom braku ćerkom Koe Zaharije\\" They had two daughters, Jelena (named after Balša's mother) and Teodora. Jelena married Stjepan Vukčić Kosača and was mother of Queen Catherine of Bosnia and Vladislav Hercegović. In 1415 Balša's only son and the only male descendant of the Balša family died.

Background  Mining laws in developed countries require trained, equipped mine rescue personnel to be available at all mining operations at surface and underground mining operations. Mine rescue teams must know the procedures used to rescue miners trapped by various hazards, including fire, explosions, cave-ins, toxic gas, smoke inhalation, and water entering the mine. Most mine rescue teams are composed of miners who know the mine and are familiar with the mining machinery they may encounter during the rescue, the layout of workings and geological conditions and working practices. Local and state governments may have teams on-call ready to respond to mine accidents.  Rescuers and equipment  U.S. mine rescuer, c. 1912 The first mines rescuers were the colliery managers and volunteer colleagues of the victims of the explosions, roof-falls and other accidents underground. They looked for signs of life, rescued the injured, sealed off underground fires so it would be possible to reopen the pit, and recovered bodies while working in dangerous conditions sometimes at great cost to themselves. Apart from safety lamps to detect gases, they had no special equipment. Most deaths in coal mines were caused by the poisonous gases caused by explosions, particularly afterdamp or carbon monoxide. Survivors of explosions were rare and most apparatus taken underground was used to fight fires or recover bodies. Early breathing apparatus derived from under-sea diving was developed and a crude nose and mouthpiece and breathing tubes was tried in France before 1800. Gas masks of various types were tried in the early-19th century: some had chemical filters, others goat skin reservoirs or metal canisters, but none eliminated carbon dioxide rendering them of limited use. Theodore Schwann, a German professor working in Belgium, designed breathing apparatus based on the regenerative process in 1854 and it was exhibited in Paris in the 1870s but may never have been used. Henry Fleuss developed Schwann's apparatus into a form of self- contained breathing apparatus in the 1880s and it was used after an explosion at Seaham Colliery in 1881. The apparatus was further developed by Siebe Gorman into the Proto rebreather. In 1908 the Proto apparatus was chosen in a trial of equipment from several manufacturers to select the most efficient apparatus for use underground at Howe Bridge Mines Rescue Station and became the standard in rescue stations set up after the Coal Mines Act of 1911. An early use of the breathing apparatus was in the aftermath of an explosion at the Maypole Colliery in Abram in August 1908. Six trained rescuers at Howe Bridge trained men at individual collieries in the use of the equipment and at the time of the Pretoria Pit Disaster in 1910 several hundred trained men participated in the operation. Mine rescue teams are trained in first aid, the use of a variety of tools, and the operation of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to work in passages filled with mine gases such as firedamp, afterdamp, chokedamp, and sometimes shallow submersion. From 1989 to 2004, the SEFA backpack SCBA was made. Rescuers used it and its successors the Draeger rebreather and Biomarine. Narrow spaces in mines are often too constricted for bulky open circuit sets with big compressed-air cylinders. In 2010, an all- female mine rescue team was formed at the Colorado School of Mines.  British mines rescue stations  The Grade 2 listed building housing Houghton Le Spring Mines Rescue Station opened in 1913 and is still part of the British Mines Rescue Service Altofts Colliery manager, W.E. Garforth suggested using a \\"gallery\\" to test rescue apparatus and train rescuers in 1899 and one was built at his pit in Altofts West Yorkshire. It cost £13,000. He also suggested the idea of a network of rescue stations. The first British mines rescue station opened at Tankersley in 1902. It was commissioned by the West Yorkshire Coal Mine Owners Association. Its building is grade II listed. In the United Kingdom a series of disasters in the 19th century brought about Royal Commissions which developed the idea of improving mine safety. The commissions influenced the Coal Mines Act of 1911 which made the provision of rescue stations compulsory.Houghton Mines Rescue 100 Years and Still Serving the Community 1913–2013 by Mines Rescue Service Limited, Houghton le Spring, 2013 p8 By 1919 there were 43 stations in the UK but as the coal industry declined from the last quarter of the 20th century many were closed, leaving six , at Crossgates in Fife, Houghton-le-Spring in Tyne and Wear, Kellingley at Beal in North Yorkshire, Rawdon in Derbyshire, Dinas at Tonypandy in Glamorgan and at Mansfield Woodhouse in Nottinghamshire. The MRS Training centre at Houghton-le-Spring opened in 1913 is one of the six surviving British rescue stations which are operated by MRS Training and Rescue. It is a Grade II listed building. Mines rescue featured in the 1952 film The Brave Don't Cry which was a testimony to the Knockshinnoch disaster. Mine rescuers have often been recognised in Britain by the award of gallantry medals. In Britain, mines rescue teams may be called to investigate holes in the ground that have appeared because of land surface subsidence into old mineshafts and mine workings.  First World War  During World War I the British army mined underneath enemy lines in occupied France, and mine rescue training was required for the soldiers, often skilled coal-miners who undertook the work as part of the Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers. Much documentation on military mining activities was classified information until 1961.

In mammals, including humans, domoic acid acts as a neurotoxin, causing permanent short-term memory loss, brain damage, and death in severe cases. This toxin is produced naturally by marine diatoms belonging to the genus Pseudo-nitzschia and the species Nitzschia navis- varingica. Nitzschia navis-varingica When accumulated in high concentrations by shellfish during filter feeding, domoic acid can then be passed on to birds, marine mammals, and humans by consumption of the contaminated shellfish. Although human illness due to domoic acid has only been associated with shellfish, the toxin can bioaccumulate in many marine organisms that consume phytoplankton, such as anchovies and sardines. Intoxication by domoic acid in nonhuman organisms is frequently referred to as domoic acid poisoning.  Symptoms and treatment  In the brain, domoic acid especially damages the hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus. It damages the neurons by activating AMPA and kainate receptors, causing an influx of calcium. Although calcium flowing into cells is a normal event, the uncontrolled increase of calcium causes the cell to degenerate. Gastrointestinal symptoms can appear 24 hours after ingestion of affected molluscs. They may include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and haemorrhagic gastritis. In more severe cases, neurological symptoms can take several hours or up to 3 days to develop. These include headache, dizziness, disorientation, vision disturbances, loss of short-term memory, motor weakness, seizures, profuse respiratory secretions, hiccups, unstable blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, and coma. People poisoned with very high doses of the toxin or displaying risk factors such as old age and kidney failure can die. Death has occurred in four of 107 confirmed cases. In a few cases, permanent sequelae included short-term memory loss and peripheral polyneuropathy. No antidote for domoic acid is known, so if symptoms fit the description, immediate medical attention is advised. Cooking or freezing affected fish or shellfish tissue does not lessen the toxicity. Domoic acid is a heat-resistant and very stable toxin which can damage kidneys at concentrations that are 1/100th of those that cause neurological effects.  Discovery ASP was first discovered in humans late in 1987, when a serious outbreak of food poisoning occurred in eastern Canada. Three elderly patients died and other victims suffered long-term neurological problems. Because the victims suffered from memory loss, the term \\"amnesic\\" shellfish poisoning is used. The story made front-page newspaper headlines. Epidemiologists from Health Canada quickly linked the illnesses to restaurant meals of cultured mussels harvested from one area in Prince Edward Island, a place never before affected by toxic algae. Mouse bioassays on aqueous extracts of the suspect mussels caused death with some unusual neurotoxic symptoms very different from those of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins and other known toxins. On December 12, 1987, a team of scientists was assembled at the National Research Council of Canada laboratory in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Integrating bioassay-directed fractionation with chemical analysis, the team identified the toxin on the afternoon of December 16, just 4 days after the start of the concerted investigation.C. J. Bird et al., Identification of Domoic Acid as the Toxic Agent Responsible for the P.E.I. Contaminated Mussel Incident, Atlantic Research Laboratory Technical Report series, № 56 (Halifax: National Research Council of Canada [NRC], July 1988), NRC Publications Archive Record 491ebf1a-8091-4f6c-ae50-0bc144108c94, .  Possible animal effects  On June 22, 2006, a California brown pelican, possibly under the influence of domoic acid,Possibly drunk bird hits windshield flew through the windshield of a car on the Pacific Coast Highway. The phycotoxin is found in the local coastal waters. Since March 2007, marine mammal and seabird strandings and deaths off the Southern California coast have increased markedly. These incidents have been linked to the recent and dramatic increase of a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae. Most of the animals found dead tested positive for domoic acid. According to the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute,Domic Acid Information and History \\"It is generally accepted that the incidence of problems associated with toxic algae is increasing. Possible reasons to explain this increase include natural mechanisms of species dispersal (currents and tides) to a host of human- related phenomena such as nutrient enrichment (agricultural run-off), climate shifts, or transport of algae species via ship ballast water.\\"  In popular culture  In the TV series Elementary episode \\"The Red Team\\" (original air date January 31, 2013), a witness is intentionally poisoned with domoic acid. In the \\"Bad Fish\\" episode of Get a Life (original air date: February 2, 1992), Sharon and Gus get amnesia after eating bad shellfish, and Chris seizes the opportunity to convince them that they are his best friends. Domoic acid poisoning may have caused an August 18, 1961, invasion of thousands of frantic seabirds in Capitola and Santa Cruz, California. Director Alfred Hitchcock heard about this invasion while working on his adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novelette \\"The Birds\\" for his feature film The Birds (1963), and asked the Santa Cruz Sentinel for any further news copy as \\"research for his new thriller.\\" See also * Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) * Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) * Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) * Harmful algal blooms (HABs)  References   External links  *Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution *Domoic acid and Pseudo- nitzschia references at Fisheries and Oceans Canada *Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, Domoic Acid, and Pseudo-nitzschia links at the ISSHA website *Domoic acid at International Programme on Chemical Safety *DOMOIC ACID — A MAJOR CONCERN TO WASHINGTON STATE’S SHELLFISH LOVERS at Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife *Crisis off our coast at the International Bird Rescue Research Center *Domoic Acid Poisoning Linked to Recent Marine Strandings and Deaths at Heal the Bay *Domoic Acid Information and History at the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute Category:Seafood Category:Medical emergencies Category:Toxic effect of noxious substances eaten as food Category:Neuroscience ","title":"Amnesic shellfish poisoning"},{"id":"5040542","text":"Blindspott is the self-titled debut album by the New Zealand nu metal group.

Background Herbert was born in Toronto on October 13, 1926.John Herbert at The Canadian Encyclopedia. After completing high school, he worked in the advertising department of Eaton's and began competing in drag pageants. In the 1940s, Herbert was the victim of an attempted robbery while he was dressed as a woman. His assailants falsely claimed that Herbert had solicited them for sex, and Herbert was accused and convicted of indecency under Canada's same-sex sexual activity law (which was not repealed until 1969). After being convicted, Herbert served time in a youth reformatory in Guelph, Ontario. Herbert later served another sentence for indecency at reformatory in Mimico. Later, Herbert travelled across North America doing odd jobs to support himself before returning to Toronto in 1955. He studied at the National Ballet School of Canada and at Dora Mavor Moore's New Play Society. Herbert co-founded the Garret Theatre with his sister Nana Brundage in 1960.\\"John Herbert Dies at 75; Wrote of Prison Life\\". The New York Times, June 27, 2001. Herbert wrote Fortune and Men's Eyes in 1964 based on his time behind bars.John Herbert at The Literary Encyclopedia. He included the character of Queenie as an authorial self-insertion.John Herbert at the Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia. The play was first staged as a Stratford Festival workshop directed by Bruno Gerussi, in 1965, but Herbert was unable to find a theatre company willing to mount a full production in Canada. It ultimately premiered as an off-Broadway play in New York City, produced by David Rothenberg and Mitchell Nestor, on February 14, 1967 at the Broadway Actor's Playhouse. Because of his past conviction, Herbert faced difficulties entering the United States to attend productions of his work. Fortune and Men's Eyes remains the most widely produced play in the history of Canadian theatre, both in Canada and internationally. It has been translated into more than 40 languages and staged internationally. A motion picture version of the work, based on a screenplay by Herbert, was directed by Harvey Hart in 1971. The play had a profound impact on producer David Rothenberg. Rothenberg went on to found the Fortune Society, a nonprofit advocacy organization that supports incarcerated and formerly-incarcerated people reintegrate into society. Although none of Herbert's other plays were as successful as Fortune and Men's Eyes, Herbert remained active as a dancer, a theatre director, an acting teacher and a theatre lecturer at Ryerson University, Glendon College, York University and the University of Toronto. Herbert died in 2001. The manual typewriter on which he composed Fortune and Men's Eyes is in the possession of the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives. A selection of manuscripts, letters and personal papers were donated to the University of Waterloo Library in 1982.

Alexander, with his brother Tancred, was a constant thorn in the side of Roger II of Sicily. He took part in a civil war that broke out in Bari. Risone, the archbishop of the city, was murdered (1117) and the princess of Taranto, Constance of France, was imprisoned at Giovinazzo (1119) by Grimoald Alferanites, the prince of Bari, and Alexander. After Roger was defeated at the Battle of Nocera in 1132, Tancred returned to the Mezzogiorno and entered into open rebellion again, taking the cities of Montepeloso and Acerenza, with the support of their populations. He raised a force with his brother Tancred, Count Godfrey of Andria, Count Ranulf of Alife, and Prince Robert II of Capua. Roger crossed the Straits of Messina with a large force and Alexander was so afraid that he abandoned his city of Matera to his son, Geoffrey the Younger, and fled to the court of Ranulf. After Roger's successfully besieged Matera, Alexander, deeply grieved, fled to Dalmatia. He was deprived of his fief and unable to return home. He tried to meet up with the Emperor Lothair II, but was set upon by thieves in a forest. According to Alexander of Telese, he was left in the town of Valona very poor. In 1142, near the end of his life, he appears as an envoy along with Robert of Capua of Conrad III of Germany to the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus. Their mission was the arrangement of a marriage between Conrad's sister-in-law Bertha of Sulzbach and John's son Manuel.

Richard Gaddes (born 23 May 1942International Who's Who In Classical Music, 2003 Edition, p. 262 (Europa Publications Ltd., London, England).) is an English opera company administrator based in the United States. Career in England Gaddes was born in Wallsend, England. He studied at Trinity College of Music in London. At Wigmore Hall, London’s famed recital hall, he created a series of lunchtime concerts designed to give young musicians opportunities to perform. This introduced such artists as flute virtuoso James Galway and the soprano Margaret Price. He formed his own artists management company, then joined Artists International Management, a company which represents musicians worldwide, including Beverly Sills and conductor John Pritchard, then music director at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. On one of John Crosby's regular visits to London to hear new singers for the Santa Fe Opera, a summer opera company in Santa Fe, New Mexico which Crosby directed, Gaddes helped him with the audition process. By December 1968, Crosby suggested the possibility of a job in Santa Fe, and from the 1969 season, he became its Artistic Administrator. Initial career at Santa Fe Opera Given his knowledge of the British operatic and musical scene of the day, Gaddes was instrumental in spotting the talent of Kiri Te Kanawa and bringing her to the Santa Fe Opera as the “Countess” in The Marriage of Figaro for her US debut during the 1971 summer season. (It was not until her Royal Opera House Covent Garden triumph in December of that year that she achieved international stature). During this period as Artistic Administrator, he introduced artists other than Te Kanawa; these included the conductor Edo de Waart and the mezzo Frederica von Stade (who was also a triumph in the 1971 Figaro). In addition, he was instrumental in arranging for the world premiere of Heitor Villa-Lobos' Yerma, which featured paintings by Giorgio de Chirico. Opera Theatre of Saint Louis Although Gaddes remained involved with the Santa Fe Opera, he left in 1976 to establish, as co-founder, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis and served as its General Director until 1987. Under his leadership, the company achieved international recognition for the development of young artists, the discovery of new singers given the opportunity to perform important roles, and the presentation of a varied repertory. For example, in 1983, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis became the first American opera company to be presented at the Edinburgh International Festival. As he notes in a 2001 interview, during this period Gaddes sought out and became instrumental in developing the careers of young singers: After leaving Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Gaddes became President of Grand Center of St. Louis, a midtown performing arts district and served as its President until 1994. He continues to serve on its Board. Career resumption at Santa Fe Opera Continuing as a consultant to The Santa Fe Opera's Apprentice Program for Artists from 1988 until 1994, he rejoined the company full-time in that year as Vice Chairman of the Capital Campaign for the planned new theater, the third on the original site. He was appointed Associate General Director of The Santa Fe Opera in 1995 and, in May 1998, was named the next General Director after John Crosby. He has held that post from 2000 until the end of the 2008 season. As General Director in Santa Fe, Gaddes sought to bring to Santa Fe the most important singers, conductors, directors and designers from the US and abroad. He continued and broadened the Company’s long-standing commitment to the performance of new and unusual works. In 2003 he appointed Alan Gilbert as the Company’s first Music Director. When Gilbert resigned the post in May 2007, Kenneth Montgomery became interim music director for the 2007 season. In July 2007, SFO and Gaddes named Edo de Waart the company's new chief conductor, effective 1 October 2007. Under Gaddes, SFO expanded its community outreach programs. These have included a Fall community production and, in a first for the company, the multi-screen video simulcast of Natalie Dessay’s performance in La sonnambula given in 2004 at the Fort Marcy Park. The video simulcast was repeated on 11 August 2007 with a performance of La bohème. In August 2007, Gaddes announced that he was ready to retire and that he wished SFO to begin a search for his successor, adding that he would remain in the position until his successor as SFO General Director was found. In November 2007, SFO announced that Charles MacKay would become the company's next General Director. Gaddes' tenure as SFO General Director concluded with his retirement on 30 September 2008. Additional career information Gaddes is a former Vice President of Opera America. He has served on panels of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Institute for Music Theatre (formerly the National Opera Institute), and as consultant for the William Matheus Sullivan Musical Foundation. He is an emeritus trustee of the board of the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and is a frequent judge at national and international voice competitions including the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions. Honors and awards The recipient of numerous honors and awards, Gaddes has been cited by Mu Phi Epsilon music fraternity, St. Louis Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America Lamplighter Award, and as the first annual Missouri Arts Award honoree, the Human Relations Award of the St. Louis Jewish-American Committee, National Institute for Music Theatre Award and Young Audiences' Cultural Achievement Award. He has received honorary doctorates from St. Louis Conservatory and Schools for the Arts, University of Missouri and Webster University. He has been honored by the Mayor of Santa Fe for his contribution to the arts, and by New Mexico Business Weekly as one of the 2005 “Top 10 Power People in the Arts.”. Gaddes has also been a frequent juror for international voice competitions. He was recognized for his services to the arts in New Mexico by proclamation by the governor of New Mexico making 16 September 2008 as \\"Richard Gaddes Day\\". In November 2008, Gaddes was one of four recipients of the first National Endowment for the Arts's \\"Opera Honors Award\\" given at a ceremony in Washington, DC. The three other recipients were conductor James Levine, composer Carlisle Floyd, and soprano Leontyne Price.Opera Honors Award portion of NEA's website References ;Notes ;Sources * Huscher, Phillip, The Santa Fe Opera: An American Pioneer, Santa Fe, New Mexico: Sunstone Press, June 2006. * Scott, Eleanor, The First Twenty Years of the Santa Fe Opera, Santa Fe, New Mexico: Sunstone Press, 1976. * Smith, Craig, \\"Success on the tightrope: Gaddes balances between the legacy and the future\\", The Santa Fe Opera - 50th Anniversary supplement to The Santa Fe New Mexican, 28 June 2006. * The Santa Fe Opera − Miracle in the Desert, Santa Fe Opera Shop, 2003.

United Airlines Flight 232 Matz was chosen for the honor of carrying the flag at the 1996 Closing Ceremonies not only because of his career in the show ring, but also for an extraordinary act of heroism seven years before. On July 19, 1989, Matz and his then-fiancée D.D. Alexander were traveling home from judging a horse show in Hawaii. They missed their connection from Denver to Philadelphia, and had a choice of two flights 20 minutes apart. They chose United Airlines Flight 232. After a catastrophic engine failure that destroyed all of the plane's hydraulic systems, the plane crashed at Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, Iowa.

The fuel will more effectively stay in suspension in the air rather than falling out of suspension and forming droplets on the floor of the manifold. Warm air from the outside of an exhaust manifold is drawn up into the air cleaner to increase the air temperature as quickly as possible after the engine starts. The air cleaner assembly incorporates a thermostatic vacuum switch that responds to the air temperature after the air filter element and actuates a vacuum motor that moves the control flap to allow the air to be drawn from a cooler location such as the top of the engine bay or outside the engine bay. If the air becomes too cold, the thermostatic switch will automatically change back to drawing heated air from around the outside of the exhaust. The system was often used with computerised carburettors or throttle body injection systems but is typically not used with multi-point fuel injection, as the problem of fuel falling out of suspension does not occur when the fuel injectors are located close to the inlet valves. There are exceptions to this however. Some vehicles, such as the 1992 and 1993 Fox body Mustangs, do use such as a system even though they have multi-port fuel injection, presumably to help the air-fuel mixture burn at the proper rate in cold weather, as even though the fuel has finely atomized, it has not properly vaporized, and therefore flame propagation will be otherwise slower. These vehicles have a MAF sensor, Air Temperature sensor, and when equipped with the 2.3L 4-cylinder, two spark-plugs per cylinder. This combination ensures the air is just warm enough to vaporise the droplets and does very noticeably improve performance and emissions at the same time in cold, northern winter weather. Fuels Heating of the intake air is specifically used for liquid fuels such as petrol that do not atomize easily under the temperature and pressure conditions present in the intake system of an engine prior to coming up to full operating temperature. Fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas do not require this heating, as they are in gaseous form in the intake, mix more effectively with the air and cannot fall out of suspension. Disadvantages While heating the inlet air provides a benefit by improving homogeneity of the inlet air and fuel, it has the disadvantage of reducing air density, which reduces the volumetric efficiency of the engine. The installation of a heated air intake system is hence beneficial to engine emissions but decreases maximum available power. Removal Where heated air intake air cleaner assemblies are fitted to engines, it is a common perception that they reduce maximum engine power and it is consequently common for them to be removed and a more open air cleaner assembly fitted in their place. This has the benefit of a marginal increase in power with the disadvantage of significantly increased emissions and, in some jurisdictions, making the vehicle illegal.

The bi-state agency was founded in 1953 by a Congressional authorized compact between New York and New Jersey \\"for the purpose of eliminating various evils on the waterfront in the Port of New York Harbor.\\" Under statutory mandate, the mission of the commission is to investigate, deter, combat and remedy criminal activity and influence in the port district and also ensures fair hiring and employment practices. New Jersey attempted to withdraw from the pact in 2018.  History  The commission was set up in August 1953 (a year before the movie On the Waterfront) to combat labor racketeering. The commission was initially created to combat unfair hiring practices on the waterfront in response to the growing number of crimes being committed there.  Division of Licensing and Employment Information Centers  The Division of Licensing and Employment Information Centers is responsible for screening, registering, and licensing individuals who are interested in working at the dock. The commission is authorized to deny or revoke the registration or licenses of those who involve themselves in criminal activity.  Police Division Waterfront Commission Police patch The Police Division operates in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor cooperates with various state, federal, and local law enforcement authorities in pursuing investigations into waterfront-related crimes. The Waterfront Commission participated in the investigation of criminal activities by the leaders and members of the Gambino crime family and union leaders. Charges of racketeering conspiracy, extortion, theft of union benefits, mail fraud, false statements, loansharking, embezzlement of union funds, money laundering, and illegal gambling, dating back over three decades, were brought forth by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in February 2008 against leaders of the Gambino crime family, their associates, and union officials.Press Release, United States Attorney's Office - Eastern District of New York, February 7, 2008. The Police Division utilizes numerous vehicles in its vehicle fleet, including marked police cars and trucks.  New York State Inspector General report  On August 11, 2009, the New York State Inspector General Joseph Fisch issued a report of his two-year investigation of the Waterfront Commission. The report detailed extensive illegal, corrupt and unethical behavior on the part of Waterfront Commission staff. Following release of the report, the large majority of the Commission's executive staff was fired, including the New Jersey Commissioner Michael J. Madonna (the New York Commissioner's seat was vacant at the time of the report's release, although the report faulted the actions of the former New York Commissioner, Michael C. Axelrod).Inspector General's Investigation Report The report's existence was due, in part, to two whistleblowers, Kevin McGown and Brian Smith, who both resigned and have since filed a discrimination complaint against the agency. New Jersey withdrawal from pact In October 2014, the New Jersey Senate passed measure S-2277 which would direct the governor of New Jersey to withdraw from the bi-state compact and transfer the commission's oversight responsibilities in New Jersey to the state police. In May 2015, Governor Chris Christie conditionally vetoed S-2277 (and the corresponding bill A-3506 passed by the New Jersey General Assembly), citing his concerns that the state lacked the authority to withdraw from the compact and arguing that the solution should be to modify the operations of the commission to minimize interference with waterfront operations.Strunsky, Steve. \\"Christie acts on bill to dissolve the Waterfront Commission\\", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, May 4, 2015. Accessed January 16, 2018. \\"Gov. Chris Christie rejected legislation intended to dissolve the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, siding with officials of the agency who insist New Jersey cannot unilaterally undo what the two states and Congress did 62 years ago to rid the docks of organized crime.... Christie, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey whose office handled organized crime cases, recommended that instead of trying to dissolve the commission, lawmakers instead push for bi-state legislation tailoring the commission's role in the hiring process to prevent excessive interference. 'While I am not unsympathetic to the merits of the bill, I am advised that federal law does not permit one state to unilaterally withdraw from a bi-state compact approved by Congress,' read a statement from Christie accompanying his conditional veto.\\" Among his final actions in January 2018 before leaving office, Christie signed legislation allowing the state to withdraw from pact.Livio, Susan K.; and Johnson, Brent. \\"Chris Christie's final acts: Bills he made law and killed, from drones to circus animals\\", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, January 15, 2018.

It is geographically located in the town of Salaspils. Total installed power generating capacity is 402 MW. There are six generators, two transformers and two 330 kV power lines (to Salaspils and Bišuciems). History The Riga Hydroelectric Power Plant was put into operation in 1974. In order to build Riga HES, a dam was constructed across the Daugava River through the middle of Doles Sala, half of which has since been flooded to make room for Riga Reservoir. Along with Doles Sala, there have been several other smaller islands drowned in order to fill the reservoir. The dam was built in the late 1970s. Aside from its main purpose of keeping the reservoir contained, its top is used as a motor vehicle highway. A railroad was also constructed on the dam, but it was utilized only during construction of the powerplant and was demolished at the beginning of the 21st century. This is because there are no existing railroads on the Daugava's left bank. This railroad began at Salaspils railway station, and ended at approximately the middle of Doles sala. Description There is a powerline pylon in the middle of reservoir, it carries two 330 kV lines (from Salaspils to Jelgava and from Salaspils to Rīgas HES), shore to shore distance there is approximately . Rigas HES is an important part of Riga's development. It is the primary source of electricity in Riga, while Riga reservoir is a source of tap water for the majority of Riga residents. In addition, the power plant is used as a compensation plant for TEC2 thermal power plant to regulate voltage in electrical networks and to compensate the power deficiencies. The power plant is operated by Latvenergo.

Act  The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 passed the U.S. Senate on September 28, 2004, after a lengthy amendment process, and, with no further changes, passed the U.S. House of Representatives on October 4. It was signed by President Bush on October 18, 2004. According to a statement released by the White House on October 21, 2004, the \\"Act provides [the U.S.] with useful new tools to address the deplorable human rights situation in North Korea by focusing [U.S.] efforts to help both those who flee the regime and those who are trapped inside the country.\\" According to a March 23, 2004, House resolution, the intent of the Act is \\"[t]o promote human rights and freedom in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and for other purposes.\\" The Act earmarked $24 million a year and made North Koreans eligible for political asylum in the U.S. The Act contains several statutes about promoting the Human Rights of North Koreans, assisting North Koreans in need, and protecting North Korean Refugees. Some are listed as following: Sec. 102. support for human rights and democracy programs, Sec. 105. United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Sec. 107. special envoy on human rights in North Korea, Sec. 202(a) Humanitarian assistance through Nongovernmental and International Organizations. Sec. 302. Eligibility for refugee or asylum consideration Sec. 302(a) of the Act states that the purpose of the Act \\"is not intended in any way to prejudice whatever rights to citizenship North Koreans may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.\\" However, interesting and potentially significant wording found in Sec. 302(b) states that \\"a national of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall not be considered a national of the Republic of Korea.\\" Previously, North Koreans had been treated as citizens of South Korea.

A large diaspora of refugees began fleeing North Korea in the mid-1990s due to ongoing privation, intermittent starvation, and political repression. Some have been resettled to South Korea, the United States, and other countries, but a large, unknown number remain in China and other East Asian nations.United States Department of State . Although not stated, but according to Brownback, the Act \\"calls on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to demand access to North Korean refugees in China, and urges heightened diplomatic pressure on China to reverse its policy of capturing and repatriating North Korean refugees. China must stop turning a blind eye to the suffering, persecution and execution of the citizens of its neighbor.\\" Sam Brownback, \\"North Korea\\" , Sam Brownback official U.S. Senate website.

Implementation  The law established an office at the State Department focused on North Korean human rights. The legislation (1) authorized up to $20 million for each of the fiscal years 2005-2008 for assistance to North Korean refugees, $2 million for promoting human rights and democracy in North Korea and $2 million to promote freedom of information inside North Korea. (2) asserted that North Koreans are eligible for U.S. refugee status and instructs the State Department to facilitate the submission of applications by North Koreans seeking protection as refugees; and (3) required the President to appoint a Special Envoy to promote human rights in North Korea.https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22973.pdf In the George W. Bush administration, the office was run by Special Envoy Jay Lefkowitz. At the conclusion of the administration, Lefkowitz issued a final report on developments since the law's enactment. On May 5, 2006, the U.S. granted North Koreans for the first time since the Act was signed. The group, six unnamed North Koreans, arrived from an unnamed Southeast Asia country, and four women of which said that they had been victims of forced marriages. As of September 15, 2008, there have been 63 North Korean refugees who have been permitted to enter the United States, most notably the latest Kim Mi-ja (alias), who became the first North Korean defector to gain permanent residence in the U.S. without an interview.\\"N.Korean defector gets permanent U.S. residency\\", Digital Chosunilbo, September 17, 2008. Retrieved on September 25, 2008. In January 2009, the United States had accepted 71 North Korean refugees for resettlement from undisclosed transit states. North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 called on the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to facilitate the unhindered dissemination of information in North Korea by increasing the amount of Korean-language broadcasts by Radio Free Asia RFA and Voice of America VOA. Content includes news briefs involving the Korean peninsula, interviews with North Korean defectors, and international commentary on events happening inside North Korea.  Reauthorization  Although there were criticisms about the pace of the executive branch implementation of the original law; the small number of resettlements of North Korean refugees and the slow processing of such refugees overseas, H.R. 5834 The North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act was presented to the President on September 26, 2008http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_5834.html and was signed into effect on October 7, 2008. The primary focus of the bill is to increase the United States' involvement in the assistance of North Korean refugees. The bill mentions several observations specifically regarding the minimal amount of progress that has taken place since the passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act 2004. The NKHRA was extended in 2008 highlighting the full-time position of the U.S. Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues. Robert R. King is the current Special Envoy who was appointed in August 2009. In 2012, NKHRA was extended until 2017 reaffirming China to halt repatriation of North Koreans. In its findings, Congress wrote that resettlement of North Koreans in the U.S. has risen and that they hope to make their resettlement program for North Koreans stronger.

It was authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896 and operated between the two villages of Kelvedon (on the Great Eastern Main Line) and Tollesbury to the south of Colchester. The line, which was part of the Great Eastern Railway (GER), was authorised on 29 January 1901, although its opening was delayed until 1 October 1904. The area served by the railway lay between the GER main line and the coast, mostly agricultural land, with fruit being a main crop. At Tiptree the jam-making firm Wilkin & Sons, founded in 1885,Tiptree jam provided a large amount of the freight traffic; it had also been hoped that a tourist trade would ensue from the yachts moored near Tollesbury. The line became known locally as The Crab and Winkle Line, although the original railway to bear that name was the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway, which used a play on the initial letters of the line. Of the intermediate stations, only Tiptree, Tollesbury and Tolleshunt D'Arcy had substantial buildings; the others merely had an old passenger coach for accommodation. All the platforms were at a low level; there was no signalling, since only one locomotive worked the line; and only local tickets were issued on the trains; there were no through tickets to mainline stations.The Kelvedon & Tollesbury Light Railway, The Railway Magazine Tothill Press Ltd, No 496 Vol 96 December 1950 The extension to Tollesbury Pier never brought the expected traffic. During World War I it was used for troop training on the river and was subsequently closed to passengers in 1921. The government took it over during World War II and erected defences along it. The Engineer's Line Reference for the line is KET. Tolleshunt Knights Halt, 1950 The whole line closed for passenger traffic after the last trains on 5 May 1951. Freight traffic continued between Tollesbury Pier and Tiptree until 29 October 1951. The section between Tiptree and Kelvedon continued in use for freight traffic until 28 September 1962.

The company has developed more than 20 million square feet of real estate. History The company was founded in 1952 by lawyer Ted Lerner, after he borrowed $250 from his wife. In 1958, the company developed its first shopping center, Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton) in partnership with the Gudelsky family. Shortly thereafter, it bought 2 parcels of land in Tysons Corner, Virginia. In 1968, the company completed development of Tysons Corner Center. In 1972, the company completed development of Landover Mall in Prince George's County, Maryland, but the mall was closed and demolished in 2002. The company solicited the site as a location for a new headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 2003, a joint venture between the company and Guggenheim Partners acquired 1275 K Street NW in Washington, D.C. from JBG Smith. In 2004, in partnership with Tower Companies, the company began development of a 300,000 square foot shopping centre in Virginia and in 2008, the partners completed 2000 Tower Oaks Blvd, a LEED platinum building in Tower Oaks, which became both companies' headquarters. In 2007, the company completed construction of 20 M Street SE and in 2009, the Bureau of Land Management leased 94,435 square feet of space in the building. In 2008, the company began constructing a 2-tower combination Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites by Hilton hotel in Rockville. In 2013, the company broke ground on a 433-unit apartment complex across the street from its Dulles Town Center project and in 2014, the company broke ground on additional developments at Dulles Town Center. In 2015, the company was subject to a lawsuit after it demolished portions of its White Flint Mall to redevelop the site, in violation of a lease with Lord & Taylor. In February 2016, the company sold 2 office buildings in Fairfax, Virginia. In 2016, the company completed development of 1775 Tysons in Tyson's Corner, Virginia. In 2018, the company announced that it was looking to sell the site of the former Landover Mall.

It has been replaced by the Spirit of Queensland. History 1556 and a 1720 class haul the northbound Sunlander through Yabulu in 1991 Lounge car of The Sunlander in 1978 From December 1924, when the North Coast line was completed, a steam hauled non air-conditioned train provided the service. In 1935, a new train named the Sunshine Express was introduced. This train of wooden carriages featured varnished timber internal panelling made from natural Queensland timbers. Comforts for that period included electric fans, electric lighting, and leather upholstered seating. Accommodation included sleeping berths for first and second class passengers and seating only carriages. In December 1949, Queensland Railways placed an order with Commonwealth Engineering for eight M series carriage sets totalling 99 carriages to introduce air-conditioned rolling stock to its long distance services. In addition QR's own North Ipswich Railway Workshops built a train. The carriages were designed to travel to all parts of the system with a maximum axle load of nine tons, which was a challenge for the dining cars. New features included showers in the sleeping cars, roomettes in first class and head end power cars, especially necessary where trains may be delayed by floods or other events, as was often the case.\\"A Brief History of the Sunlander\\" Motive Power issue 96 November 2014 pages 33-41 The Sunlander commenced service on 4 June 1953, replacing the Sunshine Express. This new air conditioned train was hauled by a diesel locomotive and by eliminating steam locomotive servicing stops, the transit time to Cairns was reduced from 45 to 41¼ hours. By the time it ceased in December 2014, the time had been cut to 31 hours with many infrastructure upgrades having taken place.Timetable Queensland Rail 16 December 2014 As further rolling stock was delivered, a second weekly service commenced on 30 November 1953 building up to five on 9 December 1955. The much delayed Ipswich built set was commissioned on 10 May 1961, allowing the service to build up to six services per week, this was reduced back to five on 8 November 1970 to release stock for the Capricornian. This was further reduced when the luxury Queenslander commenced operating on the Brisbane to Cairns route. On 29 February 1992, a motorail service was introduced. In 2014, the service was gradually replaced by the Spirit of Queensland using extra Diesel Tilt Trains. From 13 October 2014, the number of weekly services was reduced from three to one, with the last service departing Cairns on 31 December 2014.World class trains for Queensland supporting 800 Maryborough jobs Minister for Transport 27 October 2010Spirit of Queensland QueenslandSpirit of Queensland factsheet Queensland RailSunlander Farewell: Brisbane to Cairns service makes final journey after 61 years and 3.5 million passenger journeys ABC News 30 December 2014 Route The route followed the North Coast line from Brisbane in the sub tropical region of South East Queensland through to the tropical north region. The train travelled the coastal strip between the beaches and the Great Dividing Range passing diverse country including the Glasshouse Mountains, the sugar cane country of North Queensland and the tropics beyond Townsville. Rolling stock The Sunlander was operated by M series carriage stock. From the early 1980s this was supplemented by L series stock. Motive power was provided by diesel locomotives throughout until the North Coast line was electrified in 1989 with the 3900 class operating the service south of Rockhampton. Following the cessation of electric locomotive working on the North Coast line, The Sunlander was again diesel hauled throughout. Following the reorganisation of Queensland Rail's freight operations in preparation for privatisation, the locomotives were provided by QR National. On 1 July 2014, this function was taken over by Queensland Rail. Passenger facilities Facilities on board included two food service cars. A Buffet car provided a full meal service and a refreshment car provides takeaway food service. Two classes of travel were available *Queenslander Class – premium service with all meals provided and twin berth accommodation *Standard Service – seats and berth accommodation Preservation Some of the former carriages have been preserved. The Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway at Swanbank were gifted six M-class cars following their retirement. Of those, three had been formerly used on The Sunlander: *Sleeping car MAS 1540 (the final M car) *Dining car MDC 1461 *Tropics club car 1502 (in its 1990s configuration) Four of the M-class cars (including two of those listed above) have now undergone work to return them to traffic as the Queensland Pioneer Dinner train over the seven kilometres scenic railway outside Ipswich, and are sporting the blue and white livery they first wore in 1953. These cars had their first trip as the Queensland Pioneer Dinner Train on 22 July 2017. The Q Train is a fine dining restaurant on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria.

Background In the 1888 timetable the train from Brisbane to Roma was officially called the Western Mail, with some runs extended through to Morven. With the opening of the line from Morven to Charleville on 1 March 1888 the train was again extended. Victorian Railways introduced air- conditioned trains in 1935, and Queensland Rail decided to follow suit in the late 1940s. Steel carriages were designed to travel to all parts of the system, meaning a maximum axle load of 9 tons, which was a challenge for the dining cars. New features included showers in the sleeping cars, roomettes in first class and head end power cars, especially necessary where trains may be delayed by floods or other events, as was often the case. History The Westlander was introduced in August 1954, replacing the Western Mail and its wooden carriages with the present Commonwealth Engineering, Rocklea steel air- conditioned carriages. The route from Brisbane to Cunnamulla was , with a connecting service to Quilpie from Charleville, from Brisbane. Initially the Quilpie connecting train was not air-conditioned, so in 1967 a generator was fitted to an insulated van to provide power for an air-conditioned sitting car and mechanical refrigeration for the van to provide this comfort on the Quilpie service. Later the Westlander was divided at Charleville, the service to Quilpie being nicknamed the Flying Flea and consisted of two passenger carriages, a guards van and power van. In August 1994 the service was cut back to Charleville.\\"QR's Westlander Service Truncated\\" Railway Digest September 1994 page 14 The return service departed Cunnamulla at 09:00 arriving in Brisbane at lunchtime the next day. Even with the line speed from Cunnamulla being , the train was still preferred by many due to the lack of quality roads at the time. By 1957 freight wagons were also attached to the train, including louvred steel QRX and QLX-T wagons, and MPR refrigerated wagons. Up to 16 vehicles could make up the train. Passenger services beyond Charleville to Cunnamulla and Quilpie were withdrawn in 1994. Today As at October 2020 the train runs twice weekly to Charleville with a journey time of 17 hours. Connecting coach services operate to Cunnamulla and Quilpie. The dining and sleeping cars were withdrawn from 1 January 2015, with catering now provided by at seat snack packs delivered at meal times.The Westlander Factsheet Queensland Rail 3 January 2015\\"Westlander and Inlander to lose sleeping and dining cars this month\\" Railway Digest January 2015 page 16 The MPC Power and Baggage Car (MPC 1450) was retired during the COVID-19 shutdown and replaced with QPB Power and Baggage Car (QPB 1998) which until late March was deployed on the Tilt Train Diesel Replacement Service or \\"Tiltlander\\".

Biography Adlon was the grandson of Lorenz Adlon, founder of the famous Adlon Hotel in Berlin, where he spent much of his childhood. Adlon was the son of Louis Adlon, Sr., who had five children with his first wife Tilly. After almost 15 years of marriage, he met a hotel guest, the German-American Hedwig Leythen (1889-1967), called Hedda, at a New Year's Eve party in the Hotel Adlon, left his wife and children, and in 1922 he married her. It was one of the biggest scandals of Berlin in the 1920s. Tilly moved with her daughter Elisabeth, then two, to the south of Germany, while the other children Susanne (mother of Percy Adlon), Lorenz and the twins Carl and Louis (junior) were sent to boarding school and later all four emigrated to America. Adlon was a supporting actor and bit player in Hollywood from the late 1930s. He married Rose Douras Davies, sister of actress Marion Davies. Adlon became a war correspondent for International News Service in May 1945, sent by his wife's sister's lover, William Randolph Hearst to a ruined Berlin, sees only a ruin of his parents' house, and a burnt Hotel Adlon. His first article is about personal loss, the destroyed city of his youth and the death of his father. He died of a heart attack following a trip to Mexico. Originally interred in the Douras Family Mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, he was removed and buried in front of the mausoleum in March 1951.

Early life Charles Taylor was born in Hull in 1922. Education He began his degree at Queen Mary College (a constituent college of the University of London), but the college was subsequently evacuated to Cambridge during World War II. He graduated in 1943 and after working for the Admiralty during the war, then worked as a lecturer and then a reader after completing his PhD. Career His first work was for the Admiralty designing radar countermeasures, work that eventually took him to Harvard University in the United States until the end of the war. He then studied for a PhD at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and was there from 1948 until 1965. He worked for a long time with Henry Lipson on the development of optical diffraction analogue methods. He was awarded a DSc in 1960. In 1965 he moved with his family to Cardiff to take up the position of Chair of Physics at University College Cardiff, where the main interest of the department was X-ray crystallography, in the same field as the work he did with Lipson in Manchester. He was appointed to the post of Visiting Professor of Experimental Physics at the Royal Institution, a post he held until 1988. He also gave many other lectures to schoolchildren. In 1990 he lectured to thousands of children in Tokyo as a follow up to his Christmas Lectures in London the previous year. Publications Taylor was the author of a number of books, including 'The Art and Science of Lecture Demonstration'. Most notably, with Stephen Pople, he wrote the worldwide selling 'Oxford Children's Book of Science' (1994). Lectures As well as his work in research, Taylor also had very close links to the Royal Institution. He had always had a strong interest in music and its relationship with physics. In 1971 he lectured to schoolchildren for the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on Exploring Music covering physics and music. In 1989 he became only the third person since 1945 to deliver a second series of Christmas lectures, with the title 'Exploring Music'. Honours In 1986 he was unanimously awarded the first ever Michael Faraday Award by the Royal Society for communicating science to public audiences. Altogether he gave over 150 lectures to schoolchildren at the Royal Institution, as well as presenting 8 Friday evening discourses there. Family life Taylor married in 1944 and had 3 children, 8 grandchildren and 2 great- grandchildren at the time of his death, in 2002 at the age of 79.

This was meant to provide an opportunity for Boyle to interfere with the criminal justice process. The arrest was carried out and an investigation by Omaha Public Safety Director Keith Lant followed. Lant held that there was both an improper plot and subsequent cover up and demanded that Omaha Chief of Police Robert C. Wadman discipline the involved officers. Wadman refused Lant's orders to co-sign the disciplinary notices based on Wadman's personal beliefs and the results of polygraph examinations of the officers. Lant personally issued the notices against the officers and recommended the dismissal of Wadman for insubordination. The Personnel Board of the City of Omaha, a citizen-panel, unanimously approved Lant's disciplinary notices and Wadman's dismissal. The Douglas County District Court upheld the disciplinary notices, but overturned Wadman's dismissal by the Personnel Board. The overturned dismissal was appealed to the Supreme Court of Nebraska which reversed the District Court's decision and found the Personnel Board's dismissal order to be legal. Supporters of the recall effort obtained 34,816 signatures on recall petitions, significantly more than the 19,669 signatures needed to force a recall election. The recall election was held in January 1987, and drew exceptionally large turnout of over 98,000 voters, 56.4 percent of those registered. Boyle was removed from office as a result of the election, in which the vote was 56 percent for his recall and 44 percent for his retention. In 1989, Boyle ran for re-election as Mayor, finishing first out of a field of six in the primary, though he lost to P.J. Morgan, a former State Senator. In 1990, Boyle ran for Governor. He lost the Democratic Primary by less than one vote per precinct Statewide. Ben Nelson was nominated; served two terms as Governor before being elected a United States senator. Boyle has served on the Douglas County Board of Commissioners since 1997. Boyle was appointed to the Douglas County Board of Commissioners after Bernice Labedz resigned for health reasons.

The Settlement is situated on land bequeathed to the City of Naperville in 1936 by Caroline Martin Mitchell. Martin Mitchell Mansion The Martin Mitchell Mansion, known to the original owners as Pine Craig, is a historic residence. The 12-room house was built with materials from Naperville businesses and stone from DuPage River quarries. George Martin II was the son of an immigrant from Scotland and made his fortune by taking advantage of local resources. He made agriculture his first venture, cultivating a farm and gradually expanding his land holdings to 1,000 acres. Martin then developed a limestone quarry along the DuPage, which became very successful in 1871 due to the high demand for stone after the Great Chicago Fire.Martin Mitchell Mansion - 1890s. Retrieved December 15, 2017. He made his riches after he co-founded Naperville Tile and Brick Works, which eventually output over one million bricks and one million tiles. The tile was primarily used to drain swamps for farming. Martin operated his end of the business in his new home upon its 1883 construction. He named the house Pine Craig, and his family members lived in the house until 1936. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The mansion is now part of Naper Settlement and underwent an extensive restoration from 2000-2003.

Until May 2006, the Pittsburgh Gifted Center was located at the McKelvy building in the Pittsburgh Hill District. In September 2006, the Pittsburgh Gifted Center was made part of a school in Pittsburgh's West End called Greenway. The move to Greenway was made with the understanding that it was only a one-year shift of location. The location for 2007-08 was cancelled and instead moving to 2016. The early draft of the Rightsizing Plan of Superintendent Mark Roosevelt called for the Pittsburgh Gifted Center to move to Pittsburgh's North Side on Ridge Avenue. That plan was nixed as the facility was not well suited to accommodate the programs. A shift to Greenway was accomplished after some political wrangling by school officials. The Ridge Avenue facility owned by the Pittsburgh Public Schools was put up for sale from 2006 until 2008. Goals The Center is to provide students to interact with students from other parts of the city and provide academic and enrichment opportunities not available in normal schools. Programs Students attend once every week on a particular day, with small classes of about 12 students. All students attending are from Pittsburgh Public Schools. Until 2010, the Gifted Center accepted students from local parochial schools. There is a variety of academic courses, and the Gifted Center provides students the opportunities to choose which ones they wish to attend. They include subjects related to basic courses, like English, Math, Language Arts, and Science. Students can also choose interest and technological courses, including JavaScript, business planning, and Web Design. The Gifted Center has also integrated technology into classes, with all rooms containing computers for student research and projects. Some of these classes may further expand on a subject for traditional school (for example, there is a Genetics class that goes into greater depth in the study of DNA than normal school classes) or they may deal with a radically different subject (for example, one teacher has trigonometry course). Information on the Gifted Center: *Demographics: African-Americans 28%-35%, White/Other 65%-72% *School year: September to June Along with its weekly classes, the PGC allows students to participate in extracurricular activities and competitions, usually on Saturdays. The Gifted Center has participated in National History Day, in which two of its students attended the state competition at Penn State University. PGC also had a team that entered English Festival, a reading competition sponsored by Duquesne University, and Math Counts. The Gifted Center is also considering offering additional competitions for students to join. The goal of the school participation is to improve public relations, boast school spirit, and to gain support to preserve the school. Mr. Peglow, the school's Social Studies teacher who administered National History Day for the school this year, is also planning to offer the competition as a class to boast the number of students participating and allowing larger group projects. The PGC was in the news when it was considered to be closed under the Superintendent Mark Roosevelt's school reform agenda. In an attempt to conserve financial resources, the superintendent wanted to return gifted education to the home schools, which could exclude smaller schools from participating in the program. However, the proposal faced stiff opposition from parents and students (some students organized a petition to save the Gifted Center; another wrote a letter opposing the closing of the Gifted Center which was published in Post-Gazette). Eventually, the board agreed to move the Center to the Ridge Avenue building, where the program existed for several years. Some people still suspect that the School Board is still considering closing the Center and it is unclear whether renovations to the Ridge Avenue building will be completed before the next school year. The PGC has a bimonthly newsletter, the Gifted Gazette.

He was born Cai Genyin () in Shaoyang, Hunan, and his courtesy name was Songpo (). Cai eventually became an influential warlord in Yunnan, and is best known for his role in challenging the imperial ambitions of Yuan Shikai during the anti-monarchy war. Cai's name has also been romanised as Tsai Ao. Biography Cai E =Early career= The Memorial Cottage of Cai E, located in Yuelu Mountain, Changsha, Hunan, China. Cai studied at the prestigious and progressive Shiwu Xuetang (School of Current Affairs), where he was taught by Liang Qichao and Tang Caichang, and went to Japan to study in 1899. Cai returned to China in 1900, when he was only 18, and attempted to take part in an uprising against the Qing Dynasty as part of the Self-Support Army, a revolutionary militia led by Tang Caichang. When the rebellion failed, Cai returned to Japan. During this second sojourn in Japan he received military training at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, followed by the Imperial Japanese Army Academy.Yuelu Academy He returned to Guangxi Province, where he held several military posts and established a military training academy from 1904–10. While in Guangxi he joined the Tongmenghui, a Chinese revolutionary organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. In 1910 he was transferred to Yunnan Province to command the 37th Brigade of the New Army and teach at the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming. One of his pupils at the school was Zhu De, who began studying there in 1909 and graduated in 1912. Shortly after the Xinhai Revolution began on 10 October 1911, Cai, leading the 37th Brigade, successfully occupied Yunnan. After the revolution he served as Commander-in- Chief of the Military Government of Yunnan.Schemmel Cai E was Governor of Yunnan from 1911–13. After the revolution Cai gained a reputation as a strong supporter of democracy and of Kuomintang politician Song Jiaoren. Following Song's assassination by Yuan Shikai, and Yuan's subsequent assumption of the presidency of the Republic of China, Yuan had Cai removed from office and eventually held under house arrest in Beijing. Tang Jiyao replaced Cai E as Military Governor of Yunnan in 1913. =Opposition to Yuan Shikai= In 1915 Yuan Shikai announced his plans to dissolve the Republic and proclaim himself the emperor of a new dynasty. After hearing of his intentions, Cai escaped assassination on 11 November, first returning to Japan and then to Yunnan. After returning to Yunnan, Cai established the local National Protection Army to fight Yuan Shikai and defend the Republic.Beck \\"Yuan Shikai's Presidency 1912-16\\" On 12 December Yuan formally \\"accepted\\" a petition to become emperor, and protests spread throughout China. On 23 December Cai sent a telegram to Beijing threatening to declare independence if Yuan did not cancel his plans within two days. When Yuan did not respond favorably, Cai declared independence on 25 December and made plans to invade Sichuan. The governor of Guizhou joined Cai in rebellion, declaring independence on 27 December. Yuan had himself inaugurated as emperor on 1 January 1916, and Cai successfully occupied Sichuan later that month. The Tomb of Cai E, located in Yuelu Mountain, Changsha, Hunan, China. Yuan sent two leading military commanders from northern China to attack Cai, but although the forces sent by Yuan outnumbered Cai's army, Yuan's commanders were either unwilling or unable to defeat him. When it became clear that Cai's rebellion would be successful, many other provinces joined him in resisting Yuan. Guangxi and Shandong declared independence in March, Guangdong and Zhejiang in April and Shaanxi, Sichuan and Hunan in May. With several provinces behind them, the revolutionaries successfully forced Yuan to abandon monarchism on 20 March 1916. After Yuan died on 6 June 1916, Cai held the positions of Governor- General and Governor of Sichuan. He left for Japan for medical treatment at Kyushu Imperial University in Fukuoka for tuberculosis later in 1916, but died shortly after his arrival. He was accorded a state funeral in China at Yuelu Mountain in Hunan on 12 April 1917. Legacy Many of the warlords who served under Yuan Shikai did not support his ambition to revive the monarchy, and Cai E was one of the leading figures who successfully forced Yuan to step down. He served as an inspiration for Zhu De, who later became one of the most successful military leaders of the Chinese Red Army, the forerunner to the People's Liberation Army.

History When the Central Pacific started running past this site in 1869, a branch line station with telegraph was established. In 1875, a post office was established for nearby ranches and farms. The community was named after a pioneer citizen. As ranching and mining activity increased in the area the town grew in size. The Western Pacific began running thru Deeth in 1910. At the time, the community had mercantile stores, a Mormon chapel, livery stables, hotels, saloons, a blacksmith and a population of approximately 250. Many dairies and farms were in the county and this town served as a depot to ship cattle and a trading center for local ranchers and ranchers from nearby counties. In 1915, a fire destroyed most of the town. The post office has been in operation at Deeth since 1875. Little remains of the original community.

Ravenscroft School is a coed independent school located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The school enrolls students between kindergarten and 12th grade, and serves 1,200 students. The school has three divisions: Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School.  History  Ravenscroft is named for John Stark Ravenscroft, the first Episcopal bishop of North Carolina and first rector of Christ Episcopal Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. The idea of a parish school for Christ Episcopal Church was born when Josiah Ogden Watson bequeathed $5,000 to the church to employ a teacher for a new parish school in 1852. His silent bequest became known in 1862, and the church began the process of opening a new school – Ravenscroft School. Founded in 1862, Ravenscroft continued under the auspices of Christ Episcopal Church until 1966 when it became non-sectarian. Housed in locations such as Raleigh's Christ Church, St. Saviour's Chapel and on Tucker Street, Ravenscroft moved to its current location in 1969 with plans to expand to include a high school. At the same time, in 1969, Ravenscroft graduated the last 8th grade class from the Tucker Street. In 1971, the dedication of the Middle School and Upper School took place and, in 1973, Ravenscroft School graduated its first class of seniors. =School characteristics= Ravenscroft Private school Raleigh NC Ravenscroft is an independent, co-educational college preparatory day school enrolling 1,207 students, pre-K through grade 12.

It was developed by Snowblind Studios, published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in conjunction with DC Comics and was distributed in Europe by Square Enix. Based on the long-running comic book series Justice League and was written by comic book writer Dwayne McDuffie. It uses the Snowblind Studios. Three handheld Justice League Heroes games were released at the same time for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Planned GameCube And Wii Versions Were Cancelled. The Nintendo DS game shares a similar visual style and gameplay mechanics to the console game, but serves as a prequel to its story. This version was developed by Sensory Sweep Studios. The GBA version is titled Justice League Heroes: The Flash and focused primarily on The Flash. The game featured 2D sidescrolling action gameplay and a sidestory to the console game's plot. This version was developed by WayForward Technologies. Plot The story of the game begins with Superman and Batman foiling the S.T.A.R. Labs ambush by robots controlled by Brainiac. After Batman and Superman defeat what they think is Brainiac, they discover that they have merely been diverted by a duplicate while another has raided the vaults of the Lab, taking Kryptonian DNA and a chunk of meteorite. Meanwhile, Zatanna and J'onn Jonzz (the Martian Manhunter) face off against Queen Bee and her drones, who are being assisted in their gradual conversion of Metropolis by some of Brainiac's robots. After Metropolis has been saved, the League responds to a series of attempted nuclear missile hijackings; firstly, The Key attempts to hijack a missile before he is subdued by the Flash and Green Lantern (John Stewart), followed by an attempt by Killer Frost which is foiled by Zatanna and Wonder Woman. Despite the League's efforts, one missile is launched undetected during a worldwide communications blackout caused by Brainiac. However, the League realize it has been upgraded; capable of breaking Earth's orbit, the missile has actually been fired at Mars in an effort to free the White Martians, who will invade Earth upon being reawakened. Superman and J'onn J'onnz travel to Mars to stop them from escaping; but this has been yet another diversion from Brainiac who, anticipating their success, took the opportunity to steal vital equipment from the White Martians. Brainiac has also freed Gorilla Grodd from imprisonment, who intends to take revenge on his jailors and humanity with use of his Earthquake Machine. While Wonder Woman assists Superman in stopping the few White Martian vessels that managed to escape Mars and J'onn Jonnz returns to the Watchtower, the rest of the League (including any unlocked characters the player may have accessed by this point) work together with Solovar to stop Grodd. Alone on the Watchtower, J'onn is ambushed by Doomsday who takes him prisoner and takes over control of the Watchtower while Brainiac steals a Mother Box from the League's vaults. Regrouping in an emergency bunker, the League manage to retake the Watchtower, free J'onn and defeat Doomsday, before confronting the real Brainiac in his lair in Siberia. Seemingly defeated, Brainiac suddenly returns to life as the Mother Box he has stolen activates - and screaming, he is disintegrated and replaced by Darkseid, released from an interdimensional prison created by a Sensory Matrix Field Generator to which he called it \\"The Apokolips Hypercube', who has been manipulating Brainiac the entire time. Confronting the League, Darkseid - his powers augmented by the Mother Box - sentences the league to his fate by banishing them to another dimension with his Omega Beams all except Superman. He then proceeds to transform Earth into a new Apokolips and holds Superman prisoner in a Kryptonite prison. The rest of the league land in an alternate dimension, and are separated upon entry. Batman and Zatanna, Wonder Woman and Flash, and J'onn J'onnzz and Green Lantern all must fight separate groups of alien entities to survive and escape. Along the way, Green Lantern picks up a strange radiation that will allow them to survive Darkseid's Omega Beams. It turned out according to Batman, that Darkseid may have banished the League, but the Mother Box tricked him and sent them to that dimension. Regrouping, the League returns to Apokolips Earth, rescues Superman, and they defeat Darkseid by knocking him into the Sensory Matrix Field Generator, imprisoning him once again in his interdimensional prison and restoring Earth to normal. Back at the Watchtower, with the Sensory Matrix Field Generator locked away in the League's vaults, Batman informs the others that if a danger like this should happen again, they would be there. There are an additional four supervillains unique to the Nintendo versions of the game: both the GBA and DS versions feature Circe and Zoom, while the DS also includes General and Prometheus. Gameplay The game features most of the best known superheroes from the DC Universe, including Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman among others. Each level consists of two members of the Justice League battling a variety of villains and their henchmen. When the game is being played by a single player, the player can freely switch between both of the two Justice League members and play as whichever one he or she prefers. In a two player game, the players can only switch which characters they control by mutual consent. There was another Justice League game in development from Midway Games that was canceled in 2004 but, according to Warner Bros., this game is totally unrelated to the current project. Upon starting a new game, the player has immediate access to Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, John Stewart, Martian Manhunter, and Zatanna, but more characters (as well as alternative costumes) can be unlocked as the game progresses. These unlockable characters can only be used on levels in which the player(s) can choose which characters to take whereas the costumes can be used at any time. There are also initially three difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard) and then upon completion of Hard, Elite is unlocked, and then upon completion of Elite, Superhero is unlocked. In each successive difficulty level, the opponents do more damage to the superheroes and also have more health/life, offsetting the gains in skills. On Superhero difficulty, many of the opponents will kill most superheroes in one hit, so the player must have mastered a number of skills and strategies before the players deal with them.

These alternative costumes vary the characters game stats by small amounts and recreate classic or alternative costumes from the character's history. For example, Superman and the Flash can be made to look like their older counterparts from the Earth-Two universe (Jay Garrick included), while one of the alternative costumes for Batman is the famous blue and grey costume with the yellow elliptic bat emblem on his chest, as well as the Batman Beyond suit. The unlockable Green Lanterns have exactly the same powers as John Stewart and are effectively just changes to the costume, voice, and minor visual differences in their powers and combat animations and fight idles: John Stewart has a rectangular shield, Rayner a triangular one. Reception The PlayStation Portable version was praised for customization and co-op game play. It also received better reviews by both fans and critics than the console versions. The game was unfavorably compared to the similar multiplayer Marvel games X-Men: Legends and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, which allow the player to choose any character on any level, while Justice League Heroes contains several levels where the choice was taken away. The DS version was not well received as well, with Nintendo Power giving it a 3.5, GameSpot a 5/10 and IGN a 4.4. The GBA version received generally positive critical response.

Transfer of property located in County of Piatt, Township 18 North, Range 5 East of the Third Principal Meridian. Printed copy pp. 1, 7 The National Park Service registered the Robert Allerton Estate as a National Historic Place on July 18, 2007.National Register of Historic Places Listings, July 27, 2007 The Allerton Natural Area within the park was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1970. As of 2007, the park was used by approximately 100,000 visitors per year. It has been described as \\"a vast prairie turned into a personal fantasy land of neoclassical statues, Far Eastern art, and huge European-style gardens surrounding a Georgian-Revival mansion\\" . About Robert Allerton Robert Henry Allerton (1873–1964) was heir to a Chicago banking and stockyard fortune created by his father, Samuel Allerton (1828–1914), one of the founders of Chicago's Union Stock Yards. Robert was artistically inclined from his youth, and he studied art for four years in Munich, Paris and London. In 1897 he returned to Illinois and settled on one of the family's farms near Monticello. Two years later he began work on the imposing brick mansion. Throughout the next forty–seven years Robert Allerton transformed the country house, The Farms, into a central Illinois showplace estate, with activity climaxing in the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1932 John Gregg (1899–1986), who would become Robert Allerton′s legally adopted son in 1960, was employed full time to design new gardens and interior features in the house and help with the farm management. Gregg had been working for Chicago society architect David Adler (1882–1949) until the effects of the stock market crash in 1929 caused a drop in house design commissions. Gregg took the Allerton surname in 1965 following Robert Allerton′s death. Allerton also pursued ties with the University of Illinois. In September 1920 while living at The Farms he was asked by the University to serve as an advisory member to the Campus Plan Commission. The Commission finished its work by October 1922 with the completion of the plan for the area south of the Auditorium by Charles A. Platt (1861–1933) and was discharged at that time.Tilton, Leon Deming and Thomas Edward O′Donnell (1930) History of the Growth and Development of the Campus of the University of Illinois. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. pp. 89, 121 In 1926 Allerton established the Allerton Scholarships in American architecture. Annually, he invited graduating students in architecture and landscape architecture to The Farms. One of many sculptures in the park Gift to the University of Illinois After the Great Depression, World War II, and U.S. federal income taxes made it more difficult to staff and operate stately homes like The Farms, the Allertons moved to Lawai-Kai (now Allerton Garden), Kaua'i, Hawaii, in 1946, after deeding the Piatt County property to the University of Illinois. At the time, taxes on Allerton land accounted for one-fifth of all tax revenue to support public works in the Willow Branch Township. The university, however, disputed its obligation to pay taxes on the estate, citing itself as a non- profit, tax exempt state institution. The Township, not wishing to lose a significant portion of its tax funding, protested. The University was found in 1949 to be in delinquency of unpaid real estate taxes. A later Illinois Supreme Court ruling resolved the matter: the University would make an annual payment in lieu of taxes to Piatt County. The public park and woodland acreage are today tax-exempt; only the income-generating farmland is taxed. When deeded to the University on October 14, 1946, the 5,500 acre estate was worth approximately $1.3 million.University of Illinois: Virtual Campus Tour Adjusted for inflation, it would be worth nearly $14 million in 2011 dollars. The estate was logically divided into three areas. The principal area of 1,500 acres, originally known as the Woodland Property, was renamed the Robert Allerton Park. A smaller area of land located north of the Park area was put to use for the Illinois 4-H Memorial Camp and its related recreational programs. Finally, the third and largest area composing 3,775 acres of land in eight different farms all north of the Sangamon river was farmed by tenants and the income used to support the rest of the Park.Danforth, Par and the University of Illinois (1951). Robert Allerton Park. University of Illinois Press. Urbana-Champaign, IL. In 2007 the north farms were turned over to the University of Illinois Endowment in return for shares entitling the park to a percentage of the annual return on the endowment investments. The tenants are required to submit cash bids for leases on the land they farm. The Allerton farms in Robert Allerton's time consisted of Piatt North No. 1-8 (PN No. 1-8) and Piatt South No. 1-6 (PS No. 1-6). PN No. 1 was the headquarters for the farm operations.Thompson, Stephen A. (2002). Historic Resources Survey and Evaluation of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Allerton Related Properties, Piatt County Illinois. Office for Planning, Design & Construction, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pp. 21-31 The last of Allerton's buildings at this site were the c.1862 farmhouse, demolished in 2014, and the c.1912 Amenia wooden grain elevator that burned on 15 April 2015.″Old Allerton bin near Cisco burns″. The News−Gazette (Champaign, Illinois). 17 April 2015, p. B-3. PN No. 2 became part of Allerton Park and has been used as a diversified farm. The c.1880 farmhouse was demolished in 2013, but several farm outbuildings remain. PN No. 1, 3-5, 7-8 are tenant farms turned over to the Endowment in 2007. PN No. 6 field acreage became part of PN No.4 when the farmstead buildings were demolished to make room for the WILL AM/FM/TV transmitter tower and equipment building in 1966.Thompson 2002, pp. 77-79 Along with Robert Allerton's gift to the University of Illinois in 1946 he gave the six farms south of the Sangamon River to the Allerton Trust to be administered for the benefit of The Art Institute of Chicago. PS No. 1 was sold to the university in 1993 and added to Allerton Park. PS No. 2-3, 6 were sold to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources in 2000-2002. PS No. 4 and 5 were sold at auction in November 2000. After the university took possession of the estate in October 1946 the park remained closed to the public because it lacked staff and amenities. The first event on the grounds was a gala garden party on 16 May 1947 to celebrate the inauguration of George D. Stoddard (1897–1981) as president of the University of Illinois. An open house on 24 May gave the public a glimpse of the future park, but the grounds remained closed until 1949. Several years were required to prepare Allerton House as a conference center, with the first conference being held in June 1949. This was a Seminar on Educational Radio with participants from all over the United States and several foreign countries. The two-week conference was directed by university specialists in mass communications.Stephens, Carl, ed.(1950). Illini Years, a picture history of the University of Illinois. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 114. Allerton was a philanthropist for most of his life. Today, both Robert Allerton Park and Allerton Garden in Hawaii are open to the public. Allerton also made significant gifts and bequests to the Honolulu Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago. Gardens Allerton Park's gardens consist of a 1/4-mile-long (0.4 km) formal garden, and a 1-mile-long (2 km) sculpture walk extending westward from the end of the formal garden. The gardens incorporate many pieces of sculpture and ornaments. The gardens are laid out along an axis oriented on the course of the Sangamon River, which runs from northeast to southwest through the park. Directions in the park are generally given as if the axis was straight east and west. =Fu Dog Garden= This garden, featuring an array of 22 blue porcelain Fu Dog statues in front of white fir trees, was originally commissioned in 1932 to display Allerton's collection of the ceramic statues. The focal point of the garden is these 22 statues mounted on concrete pedestals. Standing behind the pedestals are opposing rows of fir trees that form the garden's outer border. To allow enough sunlight to reach the garden, the surrounding woods were cut back approximately 100 feet. North of this garden stands the House of the Golden Buddhas, a folly which permits an aerial view of the garden.https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ldr/www/ Description of Allerton Park by Leslie Rankin =Herb Garden= The Herb Garden Located behind the stable, the Herb Garden, also called the Kitchen Garden, is characterized by its many green herbs and a green porcelain Fu Dog statue. It was redone into its present form in 1997, and plantings were started in 1999. In the years since then a sundial, an urn and a Longshadow planter have been added. Plantings were removed from half the garden in order to use it as a staging area for the Allerton House roofing project in 2015–2016. This area was replanted in May 2019. =Brick Walled Garden= Walled Garden The oldest garden on the Allerton Estate, the Brick Walled Garden was constructed in 1902 and is characterized by its tall, red-brick walls. It was originally a vegetable garden with bean trellises and a dipping pool in the center for irrigation. In the 1940s the plantings were changed to grassy quadrants bordered with hedges.Thompson 2002, p. 159. The pool was replaced by the present center feature, the Girl with the Scarf sculpture. The sculpture, a white concrete figure by Lili Auer (1904- ), was added to the garden in 1942.Scheinman, Muriel (1995). A Guide to Art at the University of Illinois; Urbana-Champaign, Robert Allerton Park, and Chicago. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. pp. 111-112. Owing to the decay of the brickwork, the garden was restored in the summer of 2010. Large parts of the walls were entirely demolished and rebuilt. Eight stone fruit baskets and six orb finials, or globe stones, dating from 1905 were restored to the new walls. New walkways, including an ADA wheelchair ramp, were installed, along with new plants, flowers, espaliered apple trees, and other landscape elements.Restorations and Closures at Allerton Park Burgin, Martha and Maureen Holtz (2009) Robert Allerton, the Private Man and the Public Gifts. Champaign: The News-Gazette, Inc. p. 38. In 2019 the pea gravel walks were converted to hard pebble aggregate to make them wheelchair accessible. =Triangle Parterre Garden= This garden was defined by towering arborvitae trees and annual flowers in triangular hedge parterre patterns in recent years. In spring 2019 the garden was cleared of vegetation and replanted with new arborvitae and boxwood hedges to bring it more in scale with Robert Allerton's original design. On the gateposts at the east and west ends are two stone animal sculptures called Assyrian Lions patterned after an ancient prototype.Thompson 2002, p. 160 A stair tower pavilion built in 1987 stands beside the common wall with the Peony Garden. This replaced an earlier tower built to enclose the stairs to the now closed Wall Walk along the Peony Garden. =Peony Garden= This garden was designed to showcase nearly 70 varieties of peonies and is enclosed on three sides with concrete walls. The north wall has a cantilevered Wall Walk intended to permit visitors an aerial view of the garden. Due to age and deterioration of the wall, the walkway was closed by the 1980s.https://web.archive.org/web/20110603064411/http://www.worldisround.com/articles/21196/index.html At the east end of the garden stands a limestone copy of the Three Graces sculpture by Germain Pilon (1535-1590) in the Louvre, Paris.Scheinman 1995, pp.114-115 = Chinese Maze Garden = Chinese Maze Garden The Chinese Maze Garden features two sets of hedges trimmed in a variation of the ancient Chinese symbol Shou, suggesting a maze. Two large fish fountain statues purchased by Robert Allerton in Peking (now Beijing) in 1930 sit in the center of each maze. Two stair towers outside the garden wall once permitted garden visitors access to an aerial view of the Maze from the Wall Walk. Unfortunately, the towers are no longer standing today. Burgin and Holtz 2009, p. 40 A hosta garden occupies the tower sites. The wrought iron gates were designed by John Borie, and were originally located at the Brick Wall Garden.Finnigan, David L (2017). Inside Allerton: The essential guide to Robert Allerton Park. Springfield, IL: G.S. Brenac. = Annual Garden = Located adjacent to the meadow, the Annual Garden is characterized by its colorful flower beds and the Marble Faun statue at the east end. This figure is based on a Roman original in the Naples Museum.Scheinman 1995, p. 108 In May 2015 a limestone obelisk was placed in each of the long beds as a decorative feature. These obelisks were designed and carved by Charles Laing (1878-1959) of Chicago for Robert Allerton, and were formerly on either side of the Allerton House entrance door.Stone Obelisks for Robert Allerton Esq. at Monticello, Illinois. Charles Laing, sculptor, 6835 Calumet Ave., Chicago, Illinois. c.1917. Listed in Scott Alan Mehaffey, The Allerton Architectural Archives. Part I: 1899-1946. 1988 (unpublished) Plan no. 352. They were removed from the garden in spring 2019. =Sunken Garden= Before the Sunken Garden was created in 1915, the area had been used as the estate's garbage dump. An earlier design of the garden featured gazebos at either end. John Gregg Allerton redesigned the garden several times with the final version being completed in 1932. The garden is now a favorite spot for weddings, concerts and graduation ceremonies. The Sunken Garden features a large, open grassy area sunken below the usual ground level, surrounded by walls and with four towering Balinese style gateways. Atop the gateways are bronzed Guardian Fish statues called shachi. They were thought to protect the home from fires. Robert Allerton purchased them in Japan where he had seen the originals at Nagoya Castle. Gateways and fish were added c.1931.Scheinman 1995, p. 125 Features =House of the Golden Buddhas= Avenue of the Chinese Musicians Characterized by its golden Buddha statues, this structure is a two- story folly, the upper floor being an observation deck for the Fu Dog Garden. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Fu Dog Tower.\\" The lower part is an octagonal concrete tower built in 1917 that houses two gilded teakwood Buddhas from Thailand and a limestone sculpture of Hari-Hara, a Brahmin god. This sculpture is a copy of a 7th-century statue in the Musée Albert Sarraut in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Scheinman 1995, pp. 133-136 A circular iron stairway leads up to the ornate New Orleans style cast iron gazebo purchased and installed by Robert Allerton in 1924.Thompson 2002, p. 130 Glass doors and windows were added in 1986 for security, but the doors were removed in 2004. In summer 2007, extensive repairs were made to the tower, including restoration of the roof, and removal of the windows, which were not original to the building.http://www.continuinged.uiuc.edu/oce- sites/allerton/upload/AllertonSummer08Newsletter_4-17-08.pdf Nature of Allerton Newsletter, Vol.6, No.1 Summer 2008 =Avenue of the Chinese Musicians= Connecting the Maze Garden to the Sunken Garden, the Avenue of Chinese Musicians features a dozen statues representing various flute, drum, and stringed-instrument players. In 1912 this space was just a tree-lined avenue. The statues were moved from the Lost Garden located on the South Side of the park to this area in 1977. The present statues are copies of the originals purchased in England by Robert Allerton. =Sun Singer= The Sun Singer The sculpture walk concludes with The Sun Singer, a copy of an Art Moderne bronze sculpted by Swedish artist Carl Milles (1875-1955) in 1919 to stand overlooking the harbor in Stockholm. Robert Allerton commissioned a reduced size copy in 1929, but the artist sent a 16-foot full−size casting instead. After the statue arrived John Gregg Allerton designed a three−tiered platform styled after the Altar of Heaven in the Forbidden City of Beijing as a base in 1932. The statue depicts the Greek sun god Apollo. On his helmet is the winged horse Pegasus, and relief figures of the nine Muses surround the base. Under his right foot is a tortoise, an allusion to the first lyre made of tortoise shell by Hermes and given to Apollo.Scheinman 1995, pp. 129–130 The Sun Singer underwent a $39,000 restoration in June–July 2007 to remove vandal graffiti and restore the patina of the , sculpture.The News-Gazette (Champaign, Illinois). Sun Singer sculpture removed for restoration. June 16, 2007.Herald & Review (Decatur, Illinois). Allerton Park's Sun Singer statue returns to pedestal following restoration July 28, 2007. =Death of the Last Centaur= Located in the forest past the formal gardens, this statue by the French artist Emile-Antoine Bourdelle (1861-1929) is of an allegorical scene, the death of Paganism. In a hazardous process seldom used today, the figure was cast in bronze to which gold had been added. Half man, half horse, the centaur represents the musician Chiron, who offered his own life in exchange for that of Prometheus, the benefactor of the human race in ancient Greek mythology. After Robert Allerton purchased Death of the Last Centaur from Bourdelle in Paris in 1929, John Gregg Allerton designed this setting for it. The park's two major trails on the north side of the Sangamon River intersect here in the shape of a cross. A set of 60 concrete steps leads down toward the river, and four massive pillars stand at each end of the cross−path. Death of the Last Centaur can also be reached by car on Old Timber Road. There is a small parking lot and a wooded path to the sculpture. =Frémiet Sculptures= Two bronze sculptures by the French artist Emmanuel Frémiet (1824-1910) were returned to Allerton Park in September 2016. The sculptures are not original Allerton pieces, but were donated to the University of Illinois in 1959 and subsequently placed along the park trails. They were loaned out for a traveling exhibition in 1980, moved from the park to the Krannert Art Museum in 1988, and finally placed in storage until new settings were created in the park. Popularly called Gorilla Carrying off a Woman and Bear and Man of the Stone Age (Denicheur d′Oursons), they depict violent encounters between animals and Stone Age people.Scheinman 1995, p. 137 Subject to controversy since they were created in 1885 and 1887 because of the violent subject matter, they are however, immensely popular with park visitors who enjoy being surprised by finding them in the woods along the Orange Trail. =Reflecting Pond= The pond was designed to simulate the River Thames' reflection of Ham House, one of the models for Allerton House. The pond is fed by a natural ground spring. A concrete dam and spillway allow excess water to run off into the Sangamon River. The pond has been stocked with small fish such as bluegills and has a large population of native frogs and turtles. When Robert Allerton died in 1964 his ashes were scattered over Lawai-Kai Bay in Hawaii, and there is no grave marker for him. In 1965 a granite boulder with the inscription ROBERT ALLERTON HE GAVE HIS WOODLAND HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS FOR THE PEOPLE TO ENJOY AND TO ENRICH THEIR LIVES was installed in the pond to commemorate his life.Inscription copied directly from the boulder 9 June 2015 =Old Levee Road= When the original bridge over the Sangamon River was built in 1915 a levee was constructed across the floodplain north of the river to form a level approach to the bridge. The entrance drive including the levee was paved with a single lane brick farm-to-market road running east from the Gate House, south to Allerton Road (Route 6; C.R. 1450N) and on into Monticello to accommodate fully loaded wagons going into town. An unpaved lane ran alongside the brick for the return trip. Both lanes were paved with asphalt in 1981.Burgin and Holtz 2009, p. 60 Two brick columns topped with statues of the goddess Diana and her companion, an Ephebe, were placed at the southeast gate on Allerton Road. When the old bridge was replaced by a new bridge in 2012 the entrance drive through the park was designated Old Levee Road.Name the Old Levee Road, Allerton Park and Retreat Center, Urbana. Action approved by the Board of Trustees at the Board Meeting November 8, 2012. =Pioneer Cemeteries= Two small family cemeteries established in the 1840s are located in the park. The Sheppard Family cemetery has ten markers for members of that family and several others. It is located south of the road to the Sun Singer. The West Family cemetery has markers for members of the John West family who settled near Willow Branch creek, now in the South Side of the park. The cemetery is located north of County Road 1300 North. Buildings Robert Allerton Park contains three residences as well as a number of utility structures such as barns and greenhouses. =Allerton House (The Farms)= Allerton House in the winter Allerton Park Mansion The section of the park north of the winding Sangamon River includes Allerton's 40-room (30,000 sq. ft.) stately home, The Farms. Construction of the house began on June 13, 1899, and was mostly finished about a year later, in 1900, at a cost of approximately $50,000. Adjusted for inflation, his house would have cost approximately $1.3 million in 2011 dollars. By fall of 1900, though the interiors were not completely finished, Robert Allerton moved into his new house. Construction of the supporting structures: the stables (1901–02), greenhouses (1902), Gate House (1903), and Brick Walled Garden (1902), followed afterward. The style is Georgian-Revival, influenced by the work done at the office of McKim, Mead, and White. The architect, John Borie (1869-1925), was likely influenced more by 17th century English country houses, such as Ham House. Borie and Allerton together studied many examples of English houses and gardens before deciding on the architecture and design of Allerton House and the surrounding gardens.Koeper, Frederick. Illinois Architecture. The University of Chicago Press, 1968. Like many English country homes, the main entrance is on the side of the house instead of the front, in order to offer more privacy to those entering and exiting the house. The exterior materials used for the house were Dutch bricks (Flemish bond) and Indiana limestone. The general contractor was from Chicago, William Mavor (1848-1904).Tour the Robert Allerton House The slate roofs of the house and stable were replaced with new Pennsylvania slate, copper flashing and lightning rods in August 2015–May 2016. Today the house is used as a conference and retreat center,Conferences at A–llerton as well as a reception hall for weddings.Weddings at Allerton In recent years, the house has been opened up for more events and is available to guests for overnight lodging as part of the Allerton Park Master Plan approved by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees in 2015.http://allerton.illinois.edu/the-history/ Principal rooms The House has five principal rooms, all located on the ground floor: the Gallery, the Library, the Butternut Room, the Pine Room, and the Oak Room. The purpose and names of some of these rooms have changed in the century since the house was built. Excepting the Gallery and the Library, all of these rooms have 12 ft ceilings. All of these rooms feature a fireplace, at least three windows, and a herringbone patterned hardwood floor. *The Gallery The Gallery The Gallery spans the entire length of the main house (excepting the servants' wing) and is approximately 90 feet long with a 14 ft ceiling height. It features a large marble fireplace, painted white pine paneling, and dentil crown molding. At the north end of the Gallery is the grand staircase that leads to the second story. Extending from the Gallery is the servants' wing, solarium, and the rest of the principal rooms. Above the fireplace hangs a portrait of Robert's father, Samuel Allerton (1828–1914), by Ellen Emmet Rand (1875–1941). *The Library Originally called the Music Room on the architect's drawings, the Library is two stories tall and features a parquet patterned floor. Three large, floor to ceiling windows provide a view and entry to the back terrace. Later remodeling added a second-story balcony and bookshelves on the interior wall to replace most of the wall paneling. The second floor balcony is kept locked because it contains many rare, first edition books, as well as books containing Mr. Allerton's signature. When the Allertons moved to Hawaii in the 1940s, they took most of their books with them except for about 2000 books in this collection.Allerton, John Gregg - Interview and Memoir Besides Robert Allerton's personal books there are many that belonged to his stepmother Agnes Allerton (1858–1924) and members of her family. There is a hand-written card catalog of the collection. Hanging in the library are architectural plans for a stone mantel that was never built (it doesn't exist today).Library for Robert Allerton Esquire, Monticello Illinois.

Listed in Mehaffey 1988, no. 56 and 60. The paneling shown in those plans also does not exist today; in its place are many bookshelves. The limestone plaque on the outside Library facade above the French doors facing the Library Terrace has ROBERT HENRY ALLERTON and the date MDCCCC incised on the surface. This takes the place of a traditional cornerstone. *The Butternut Room Known to be Robert Allerton's favorite room of the house, the Butternut Room was originally designated as the Dining Room. The room features butternut wall paneling. Above the fireplace hangs a portrait of Robert Allerton when he was around 24 years old, painted by his friend, Ellen Emmet Rand.62 Washington Square South, New York, New York Window benches were designed for the room by John Gregg Allerton, and added in the 1930s.The Pine Room *The Pine Room This room was originally labeled as the Library for the house. It is today named after its pine wall paneling. Over the fireplace is a portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria (1609–1669), wife of King Charles I (1600–1649) of England, by an unknown artist. On the opposite wall is a copy of a portrait of King Philip II (1527–1598) of Spain by Titian. *The Oak Room The smallest principal room, the Oak Room is located toward the back of the house, adjacent to the Library. It is so named for its oak wall paneling. A pair of French doors lead out to the back terrace. This room was marked as the Office on the original floor plans and was used for that purpose by Robert Allerton. On the wall above the fireplace is a portrait of Robert's godmother, Anna Rathbone. Four floral paintings by Rainey Bennett (1907–1998), a friend of the Allerton family, are on the other walls. Plans formerly hanging in the Gallery show a proposed, but never constructed, addition to the house that would have turned the Oak Room into an Octagonal Room and added a loggia.Sketch for West Front for House of Robert Allerton Esquire, Monticello Illinois. John Borie Architect 1905. Listed in Mehaffey 1988, no. 10A. Other rooms Other rooms in the house include the breakfast room and upstairs bedrooms. The attached servants' wing held the pantry, kitchens, laundry, woodshed, and a refrigerated room. Rooms in this wing are used as offices for staff. The Stable =The Stable= Originally built for horses, the stable was converted for use as an automobile garage when motor cars came to replace horse-drawn carriages. The stable was originally disconnected from the main house. The Marble Hall, constructed in 1912, connects the house and stable. Today the stable is used as kitchens and large dining area for conference guests. The stable facade facing the Library Terrace has two carved Indiana limestone masks designed by John Borie and located above the arched doorways leading out of a former conservatory area now called the Breakfast Room. These are known as the Masks of Pan, and are a variation of the European Green Man, a benevolent woodland spirit carved onto many cathedrals and public buildings.Anderson, William (1990). Green Man: the Archetype of Our Oneness with the Earth. San Francisco: Harper Collins. . They are bearded smiling faces with leafy foliage hair and curling rams horns. Festoons of fruit are suspended from each horn.Robert Allerton Park Monticello, Illinois, Historic Building Assessment. Class Project: Arch 419, Fall 2000, School of Architecture, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. p. 57. =House in the Woods= The Gate House Located southwest of the formal gardens along Old Timber Road, this house has a blue-gray stucco exterior and some Georgian/Neo- Classical architectural elements. The Neo-Classical front door surround was formerly the entrance door of Allerton House, and was removed during the 1912 construction of the Marble Hall in that building.Burgin and Holtz 2009, p.80 Designed by Joseph Corson Llewellyn (1855-1932), this house was constructed in 1917 not of wood, the most common building material, but instead of hollow tile and blue-gray stucco. This was done to show that houses could be built of fire-proof materials without incurring additional expense.Finnigan 2017 The house was built on the site of the former Ashby family farm. Foundations of several of the farm buildings remain. On the north side of Old Timber Road can be seen the concrete foundation of a dairy barn that burned. The 4-H Memorial Camp boat house is built on part of the foundation of another barn. Other foundations can be found in the woods behind the house.Thompson 2002, pp. 129-130 The house is located amongst a grove of evergreens, near the lake which forms the central axis of the 4-H Memorial camp. =Gate House= Architect John Borie designed this Colonial Revival style brick house built in 1903 as the residence of the head gardener.Thompson 2002, p. 128 Its masonry exterior is composed of the same materials used in Allerton House, also designed by Borie. Today it stands at what originally was the end of the public road leading to Allerton's private grounds. After an exchange of lands, this road was no longer a public thoroughfare. When the estate became a public park the road was reopened as a county road (C.R. 1400N-575E) called Old Timber Road. Rooms in the Gate House are now used to accommodate overnight visitors to the Park. The Gate House lawn, formerly the site of Robert Allerton's tennis court, is the scene of concerts during warm weather. =Music Barn= In 1993 the farmstead with house and outbuildings formerly known as the Allerton Farm Piatt South No. 1 was bought by the University of Illinois from the Allerton Trust and incorporated into the park.Thompson 2002, pp. 94-96 This area is west of the south entrance along Allerton Road. After several years as an Environmental Learning Center the circa 1890 Dutch style horse barn on the property was remodeled in 2005 into a music performance venue seating 175 in the hayloft. Ventilation is regulated by opening and closing the hay door. Because the barn has natural air-conditioning, concerts are held in the spring and autumn. It was the home of the Allerton Music Barn Festival, a classical music festival sponsored by the University of Illinois School of Music, every September from 2007 to 2014.″Entertainingly Autumn″ by Douglas L. Milburn. Community Concierge Magazine v. 8 no. 1, fall 2010, p.16 In 2016 the Festival became part of the Allerton Park Concert Series. Forests and meadows The Allerton estate still encompasses hundreds of acres of forests and meadows which are used today by 4–H members, hunters, and hikers.4-H Memorial Camp A slate of charity runs, encompassing a 5K run, a 10K run and a half-marathon, are held annually in spring. =Southern Open space preserve= The section of the park south of the Sangamon River was left almost entirely natural open space preserve during the Allerton era. It now contains a network of nature trails sloping down from parking areas toward the Sangamon River. Several of the trails have signs describing the floodplain river ecology of central Illinois. The southern section also contains a restored prairie, one of the oldest prairie restorations in Illinois, begun in 1955 and now approaching maturity. In response to a 1966 Army Corps of Engineer's plan to build Oakley Dam downstream of Allerton Park on the Sangamon River, a grassroots organization called the Committee on Allerton Park (COAP) successfully campaigned to stop construction. The southern section of the park and adjacent Sangamon River bottomland, a parcel of , was designated as the Allerton Natural Area, a U.S. National Natural Landmark, in 1970. =Lost Garden= The Lost Garden was laid out in 1932 on an east–west axis in the southwestern part of the area now known as the South Side. It was intended as a strolling and picnic garden for Robert Allerton and his friends. Although this area is now woodland and part of the U.S. National Natural Landmark, in 1932 it was farmland formerly owned by the Benz family. In typical Allerton fashion the garden was a gravel walkway lined with trees, flowers and statuary. A rectangular Summer House pavilion with a circular stair to the roof designed by John Gregg was added in 1936.Mehaffey, Scott A. (1987, rev. 1988) The Lost Garden: an Historical Perspective. A Working History Documenting the Chronological Development of a Missing Landmark. (unpublished) Remote from everything else on the estate, the garden was difficult to maintain as a public area and was gradually dismantled after 1960. Statues were moved elsewhere; the Summer House deteriorated and was torn down in 1972. Today the site is a grassy path between two concrete pedestal bases. Two brick seating walls remain by the Summer House floor slab. The site may be reached from a parking lot along Allerton Road. Notable events The first automobile arrived at The Farms when Samuel Allerton presented Robert with a 1907 seven–passenger Stevens–Duryea Big Six Touring car. That car would be worth over $100,000 today. Allerton Park was the venue for the Symposium on Principles of Self-Organization 8–9 June 1961 organised by Heinz von Foerster through the Biological Computer Laboratory based at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The massive central Illinois Valentine's Day ice storm struck Allerton Park on 14 February 1990, resulting in much damage and a four–day power outage. The Illinois Natural History Survey sponsored the Biodiversity Blitz, a 24–hour all–species inventory at Allerton Park on 29–30 June 2001. Over 2000 species of plants and animals were identified and recorded. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Allerton Park was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois' selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places.

Located on Fifth Avenue on the border of the Oakland and Shadyside neighborhoods, it houses Congregation Rodef Shalom, the oldest Jewish congregation in Western Pennsylvania and the largest Reform congregation in the area. Across the street from the temple is the headquarters of Pittsburgh's PBS station WQED. On the grounds of the building is the Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden. History At first, Rodef Shalom was not Rodef Shalom. It was 1847, and a dozen Jewish Pittsburghers established a burial society they called Bes Almon (Mourners’ House) and purchased land on Troy Hill, on the city's North Side, for use as a cemetery. By 1848, the group had rented a room downtown, on Penn Avenue and Sixth Street, and formed a congregation called Shaare Shemayim (Gate of Heaven). Then came a split, with members striking out on their own to form congregation Beth Israel (House of Israel) in 1852. A year passed, and Shaare Shemayim and Beth Israel reunited under the Shaare Shemayim banner. Rodef Shalom arose around 1855, after a second split in the Shaare Shemayim congregation. But, again, reconciliation came and, in 1860, the two congregations merged under the name Rodef Shalom. The congregation's charter, dated November 9, 1856, gives as its primary objectives “the furtherance of the cause of Religion” and “the establishment of a good school in which the young shall be instructed in the principles of the Hebrew Religion as well as general branches of knowledge.” By 1860 there were thirty-five member families, with fifty pupils enrolled in the school. The first Jewish confirmation in Pittsburgh was held in 1862 for six girls and one boy. In 1859, Rodef Shalom rented a hall on St. Clair Street in Allegheny City (now the North Side of the city of Pittsburgh). Needing more space and a place of its own, the congregation began construction of its own building in 1861. Designed by architect Charles Bartberger, the first temple was built on Hancock Street (now Eighth Street) in downtown Pittsburgh. The dedication ceremony, on March 20, 1862, featured Rev. William Armhold, Minister, addressing the congregation in German. Josiah Cohen, a teacher in the congregation's day school, delivered a speech in English. Pittsburgh's finest vocalist, Sigmund Apfelbaum performed. At first, Rodef Shalom was an Orthodox congregation. But in 1863, a transformation began when Rabbi Isaac M. Wise, a founder of Reform Judaism in America, came to Pittsburgh. His impact was quickly felt, as the congregation, shortly after his visit, voted to affiliate with Reform, adopting the Reform prayer book. The change didn't suit all Rodef Shalom congregants, with some resigning to form the Tree of Life Synagogue (the Orthodox) in 1864. Though the vote to become Reform happened swiftly for Rodef Shalom, the transition to full Reform practices did not. As the years passed, services were shortened, women and men sat together, and an organ was installed—music was vital to Rodef Shalom even then, as the choir, directed by Bertha (Mrs. Jacob) Benswanger, was reputed to be “one of the best in the country.” The transition to the English language took time. When Rev. Louis Naumburg became minister in 1865, he spoke in German. Rabbi Lippman Mayer, who succeeded him in 1870, spoke English but was more comfortable in German. Mayer, a strong proponent of Reform, later founded the Jewish Chautauqua Society. The changes didn't stop with language: By 1874, it was no longer mandatory for men to wear a hat or yarmulke and the congregation had joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. A raft of major changes came to Rodef Shalom in 1885 when, Rabbi Mayer and the congregation hosted a meeting of Reform rabbis. The resulting \\"Pittsburgh Platform\\" signaled a paradigm shift, declaring that Judaism was a religion, not a nation, and that the Bible was an ethical guide, not the infallible word of God. It stated that American Jews do not have to keep kosher. This Pittsburgh Platform guided North American Reform Judaism until 1937. J. Leonard Levy, a dynamic leader with an internationalist outlook, became Rodef Shalom's Rabbi in 1901. He had served congregations in Bristol, England; Sacramento, California; and Philadelphia. Rabbi Levy was known for his work to strengthen interfaith communication in Pittsburgh and beyond. During his Pittsburgh tenure, he started an international peace organization and co-edited the weekly Jewish Criterion, in addition to preaching at both Sabbath and Sunday services at Rodef Shalom. At Rabbi Levy's invitation, President William Howard Taft visited Rodef Shalom on Saturday, May 29, 1909. This was the first time that a sitting United States president spoke from the bimah of a Jewish congregation during regular Sabbath services. During J. Leonard Levy's rabbinate (1901-1917), Rodef Shalom's congregation nearly tripled, growing from 132 member families in 1901 to 363 by 1908. Pittsburgh was changing. New immigration patterns brought more Jews to the city and new demographic patterns saw many of these new arrivals and longer-standing congregants moving from Allegheny City and the Hill District to emerging eastern neighborhoods like Oakland, Shadyside, and East Liberty. Nevertheless, more than half of Rodef Shalom's members still lived near the Allegheny City Temple, so when a move was suggested due to crowded conditions, the congregation opted to expand where it stood. The original Temple building was torn down in 1900, replaced by a Charles Bickel-designed edifice. The new, larger structure was dedicated on September 6 and 7, 1901. Shortly thereafter, an annex for religious school classes was appended. By 1904, however, the congregation had already outgrown the space. Congregational leaders came to see Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill as the new cultural and residential centers of Pittsburgh. Rodef Shalom sold its new-but-outdated home to the Second Presbyterian Church, their downtown neighbor, for $150,000 and began its move toward the east, buying a lot near the corner of Morewood and Fifth avenues for $60,000. A design competition was held and Henry Hornbostel—the architect Andrew Carnegie selected to create Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University)—emerged the winner. Hornbostel's style merged the traditional with the modern. The double dome, 90 feet in diameter, was constructed without structural steel, instead using the Catalan vault, a Spanish vernacular style brought to the U.S. by Rafael Guastavino. For the exterior, Hornbostel chose local yellow brick, augmented with colored terra cotta flourishes. The design incorporated four representational stained glass windows by William Willet. These valued remnants of the 1901 Temple, along with a large stained glass skylight in the dome and a lunette over the Fifth Avenue entrance, were fitting additions to a building housing a Congregation that valued tradition yet embraced a modern approach to Judaism and life. The Congregation subsequently installed a 1907 Kimball organ, the largest of its kind still in use. The Temple sanctuary holds more than 900 people on the first floor and 300 in the gallery. The building was finished in time for High Holy Day services in 1907 at a cost of $250,000. Rabbi Samuel H. Goldenson came to Rodef Shalom in 1918, a year after Rabbi Levy's untimely death. He instituted further reform, persuading members to give up their privately owned pews in favor of a more democratic system of unassigned seats, a decision that attracted many more members. After 16 years at Rodef Shalom, Rabbi Goldenson went to Congregation Emanu-El in New York. In 1934, Dr. Solomon B. Freehof became Rabbi of Rodef Shalom. In addition to regular preaching, Dr. Freehof wrote extensively on Jewish law and ritual and chaired the group that updated the Union Prayer Book. For more than 35 years, Dr. Freehof's weekly book review series attracted audiences of more than 1,500 Christians and Jews. He served as president of the Central Conference of American and the World Union for Progressive Judaism. His wife Lillian wrote many plays and novels and organized a Braille service group at Temple. The congregation's growth continued throughout Rabbi Freehof's tenure, reaching peak membership of approximately 2300 member families in the early 1960s. Under his watch, the Congregation added The Religious School—designed by Ingham & Boyd—Levy Hall auditorium, and the Cohen Chapel, which was completed in 1938. A large social hall, named in honor of Dr. Freehof, was built in 1956, and an addition to the back of the building—funds for the project were donated by Allen H. and Selma W. Berkman—provided an entrance from the parking lot. With more congregants than the Temple could serve, Rodef Shalom encouraged the creation of new Reform congregations, helping shepherd Temple Sinai in Squirrel Hill, Temple Emanuel in the South Hills, and Temple David in Monroeville into existence. Dr. Walter Jacob, who had been hired in 1955 as Rabbi Freehof's assistant, became Rabbi of the Congregation in 1966 upon Dr. Freehof's retirement. He founded the Freehof Institute of Progressive Halakhah and served as president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. He and his wife Irene established the Biblical Botanical Garden at Rodef Shalom in 1986. Now Rabbi Emeritus of Rodef Shalom, Dr. Jacob remains active in Pittsburgh and abroad. He was instrumental in the creation of Abraham Geiger College, the first rabbinic training college in Germany since the Holocaust. Dr. Mark Staitman, associate rabbi since 1975, served as Rabbi of the Congregation from 1997–2003. Dr. Staitman is known for his involvement with Soviet Jewry and served as Chairman of the National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry. In 1989-1990 a major capital campaign restored the sanctuary. In 2000–2003, other areas of the building were updated for contemporary usage and handicap accessibility and a new porte-cochere entrance from the parking lot was added. As we forge ahead in the 21st century, Rodef Shalom, the Congregation and the Temple, continue to provide new opportunities for growth and continues to honor its 150-year history of service to the Jewish community in Western Pennsylvania.

The town's best years were during the 1870s, when it was an active mining and prospecting town serving the surrounding hilly region. For a brief time, Samuel Langhorne Clemens lived there and prospected, but left without having had much success. Currently, the hamlet consists of a single business – a tourist inn – and a few small houses clustered along or near the gravel roadway which permits vehicular ingress and egress. The nearest paved road, an extension of this gravel road, is about 7 miles to the east. The nearest services of any sort, other than those available at the inn, are approximately one hour's drive away. Now in Pershing County, Unionville was the original county seat for Humboldt County, serving in that capacity from its founding in July 1861 until the seat was relocated to Winnemucca in 1873.Humboldt County, Nevada The big mining boom at Unionville occurred between 1863 and 1870. During that time, the population was reported to be as high as 1,500 persons. Mark Twain arrived in Unionville with the intention of prospecting for silver in 1862, describing the town as consisting of \\"eleven cabins and a liberty- pole\\". As is common in most mining communities, after the boom, the town experienced a decline soon afterwards. By 1870, it was discovered that there was little rich ore in the district. The decline was speeded by the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad through the Humboldt valley, and the establishment of Winnemucca as a major trading and shipping center.Russell R. Elliot and William D. Rowley, History of Nevada (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1987), 101. There is now no formal government as such in the hamlet of Unionville, which is unincorporated. Some abandoned buildings such as Twain's cabin and a one-room schoolhouse remain standing in various stages of disrepair, but there is no ongoing, active effort to preserve any of these. Unionville is frequently referred to as a ghost town. Just north of the town's limits is a cemetery, which may still be used for occasional burials. A few hundred yards farther into the county, there is a fork in the main road. Aerial photographs reveal a large cemented foundation upon which stand two large structures, along with two or three smaller structures of relatively recent vintage. These structures are Unionville's local garbage dumping grounds. Ethnic diversity Paul Laveaga, one of Unionville's more prominent citizens, was born in Mexico in 1841. He was the only member of his family to leave Mexico for Nevada. When he came to the state in 1866, he worked for wages and mined in Unionville. In 1868, Laveaga opened up a lodging house and restaurant which he ran until 1884 when he left for Winnemucca. In addition, he served as post master in Unionville for many years. Laveaga was a successful businessman and well-respected by his fellow citizens. In 1874, he was elected to the state assembly where he served four terms. Laveaga also served as the Humboldt county treasurer for eight years. Although he would eventually leave Unionville for the more prominent town of Winnemucca, Laveaga's success in the state of Nevada stemmed from his initial settlement in Unionville.Thomas Wren, A History of the State of Nevada: Its Resources and People (New York: The Lewis Publishing Company, 1904), 683–684. Like other mining towns in the American West, Chinese laborers resided in Unionville and mined in the American Canyon. The town's white inhabitants were quick to exhibit virulent anti-Chinese racism. The Democratic party newspaper in town, the Humboldt Register, equated the Chinese to \\"baboons or trained monkeys.\\" In addition to anti-Chinese racism, a segment of Unionville's population, organized as the Anti-Chinese League, was responsible for forcibly expelling the Chinese population in the middle of January 1869. The Chinese, outnumbered and outgunned, did nothing to resist expulsion, nor did any of the town's religious or fraternal organizations attempt to stop it. The 35 Chinese males that resided in town were put on a wagon and taken twenty-five miles to Mill City, the nearest station on the Central Pacific Railway. Eighteen men were indicted for this crime in federal court: W S Bonnifield, William Woolcock, Peter Woolcock, Samuel Fiefield, Samuel J Bonnifield, John Cavanaugh, John McCanney, William Bush, Lewis Moore, George Holden, Jerry Job, O. Jewett, Robert Henderson, John J. Hill, “John Doe” Waitz, Lewis Dunn, “John Doe” Harrison, and James Hamblyn. Of these, only two were arrested, Lewis Dunn and John J Hill. Lewis Dunn was released under a writ of habeas corpus by District Judge George G. Berry. John J. Hill was similarly released by the judge of the U. S. District Court, Alex W. Baldwin. The indictment noted that a number of other men were involved, but that their names were unknown.Case 407: United States vs. W. S Bonnifield, et al. Criminal Case Files, 1865–1982. Records of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, Reno. In the holdings of the National Archives at San Francisco. This was a significant event which provides an early example of the attitudes of white Nevadans toward the Chinese. Anti-Chinese agitation and forced expulsion emerged in other communities throughout Nevada and the Far West. The events of 1869 did not permanently dissuade some Chinese from remaining in the county. After Unionville declined as a white mining center, scattered Chinese returned to mine the surrounding environs. Because water was at premium in the area, Chinese miners used rockers rather than sluices at their sites. As late as 1905 there were still Chinese miners that continued to work in the American Canyon, but by that time they were quite elderly and numbered fewer than ten.Arif Dirlik and Malcolm Yeung, eds., Chinese on the American Frontier (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 98–99, 106.

He often took apart and rebuilt old radios. This interest led to a career using radio and radar, in many practical and unexpected ways. Pettengill remains interested in amateur radio and his callsign is W1OUN. Pettengill began studying physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1942 at the age of 16. His studies were briefly interrupted by service in Europe at the end of World War II. When he turned 18, he was drafted into the Army where he served in the infantry and then with a Signal Corps company stationed in Austria. After World War II ended he returned to MIT where he received a Bachelor of Science (BS) in 1948. This was followed by work at Los Alamos and a doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1955. Career and research Pettengill began his career at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1954. By the late 1950s, he was part of a group using the then-new Millstone Hill radar for the earliest work in radar astronomy. When it became operational in late 1957, Pettengill used this radar to \\"skin track\\" Sputnik I, the first such observation of a satellite. His earliest research, extending beyond the Earth's orbit was with this same radar in 1961; he used it to make the first ranging measurements to another planet, Venus. These first observations yielded a value for the astronomical unit in terrestrial units which has stood the test of time and has an accuracy some 3 orders of magnitude greater than had been possible with the armamentarium of classical positional astronomy. Such knowledge was critical for the successful navigation of Mariner 2 to Venus. Pettengill successfully completed two-dimensional radar mapping of the Moon in 1960, a key step in the U.S. preparations for the Apollo program, insuring that the Apollo astronauts would not disappear under a meters-thick layer of dust. From 1963 to 1965 Pettengill served as Associate Director and from 1968 to 1970 as Director of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. At Arecibo, Pettengill with Rolf Dyce, used radar pulses to measure the spin rate of Mercury and found that Mercury's 'day' was 59 Earth days, not 88 as had been previously thought. He was appointed Professor of Planetary Physics in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT in 1970. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pettengill led ground-based radar studies of the surface properties of all of the inner planets, including the Earth's (via a \\"triple-bounce\\" experiment: Moon-Earth-Moon). Pettengill also played a leading role in the first radar studies of an asteroid (Icarus, in 1968), a comet (Encke, in 1980), and moons of other planets (the Galilean satellites, starting in 1976). In all of this work, Pettengill made use of radar systems at MIT's Haystack Observatory and Cornell's Arecibo Observatory, systems whose development he had guided for astronomical applications. Also in the 1970s, he was involved in several unmanned missions to Mars (including the Viking program). For over two decades, beginning in 1977, he concentrated most heavily on Venus, this time utilizing radars aboard spacecraft, first the Pioneer Venus orbiter and later, Magellan. For many years, he pursued the idea for using a radar altimeter to map Venus and contributed key technical ideas. The results, in part, were detailed reflectivity and topographic maps of virtually the entire planet of Venus, providing geologists and geophysicists with lifetimes of work to understand the development of Venus' crust and the history of its interior. Many planetary scientists feel he is one of the individuals most responsible for our present knowledge of Venus (aside from its atmosphere). His observations have embraced Mercury, Venus, Mars, several asteroids and comets, the Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. Awards and honours He won the Charles A. Whitten Medal from the American Geophysical Union in 1997. The asteroid 3831 Pettengill is named after him. Publications *G.H. Pettengill and D.E.

Club career Born in Torre del Greco, Campania, Esposito made his professional debut in 1997 with Pescara Calcio after having a trial with English club Everton. He went on to play in two Serie B campaigns with the team. After an unsuccessful trial with Rangers, he joined Udinese Calcio with which he first appeared in Serie A, playing just nine league games in two years and also being loaned to his previous club. In 2001–02, Esposito moved to Cagliari Calcio in the second division, being an undisputed starter during his spell with the Sardinians and scoring in double digits in three of his six seasons – in 2003–04, he netted a career-best 17 goals in 40 matches, with his team finishing in second position and returning to the top flight after a five-year absence. After his scoring partner David Suazo's confirmed departure, on 4 July 2007, A.S. Roma acquired 50% of Esposito's rights for €2 million, plus the free loan of Daniele Magliocchetti.Esposito alla Roma (Esposito to Roma) ; Cagliari's official website, 4 July 2007 Acquisizione a titolo definito con accordi di partecipazione del diritto alle prestazioni sportive del calciatore Mauro Esposito; Roma's official website, 4 July 2007 He signed a three-year contract, with a gross annual salary of €1.4 million. In June 2008, Esposito was purchased definitely by Roma for €350,000, and Magliocchetti was sold in a co-ownership deal for a nominal fee of €484. During his two seasons with the side, he was very rarely used, with all of his league appearances coming in 2007–08; on 1 September 2008, he was sent on loan to A.C.

It served as the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo. Plot In 1940, Parisian lawyer Roger Flavières is asked by his old friend Gevigne to help in a sensitive matter regarding his wife Madeleine. Gevigne claims that Madeleine has been acting strangely, but that doctors have been unable to find anything wrong with her. She seems to be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, Pauline Lagerlac, who committed suicide when she was Madeleine’s present age. Gevigne is busy managing a shipbuilding business and he asks Flavières to watch over his wife for a while. Flavières begins following Madeleine, and one day saves her after her jump in the Seine. After the two become close, Madeleine tells Flavières that she feels she has lived before, and that she has a special connection to Pauline Lagerlac and the places she was associated with. One day Madeleine insists on going to a small town west of Paris and climbing an old church belltower. Flavières, unable to follow her to the top because of his fear of heights, witnesses her body falling to the ground. Unable to come near the body, he flees to Paris. Flavières does not tell Gevigne that he witnessed Madeleine’s death. Gevigne, distraught at being questioned by the police over the tragedy, tries to flee Paris but is killed in a German air raid. A few years later, after the liberation of Paris, Flavières remains haunted by the memory of Madeleine. One day he sees a woman's face in a newsreel filmed in Marseille. Convinced that the woman was Madeleine, he travels there and tracks her down. Despite her initial denials that she is Madeleine, the woman, Renée Sourange, eventually confesses that she was Gevigne's mistress and conspired with him to get rid of his rich wife. Gevigne threw the real Madeleine from the top of the belltower so Flavières could witness it and confirm the suicide to the police, but Flavières's flight from the scene spoiled the plan. Upon the revelation that he never actually met the real Madeleine, Flavières strangles Renée and surrenders to the police. Background François Truffaut in his book of interviews with Hitchcock popularized the idea that Boileau and Narcejac wrote The Living and the Dead specifically for Hitchcock. They heard that he was trying to purchase the rights to She Who Was No More but was outbid by Henri- Georges Clouzot and was jealous of the success of Les Diaboliques. However, in his interview with Dan Auiler - Narcejac denies it. He admits that their writing team shared certain affinities with the director but they never intended the novel to be specifically for him. According to Narcejac, the idea for the book came to him in a movie theater. He was watching a newsreel, and thought he recognized a friend with whom he had lost touch during the war. \\"After the war, there were many displaced people and families—it was common to have ‘lost’ a friend. I began thinking of possibilities of recognizing someone like this. Maybe someone who was thought dead…and this is where D'entre les morts began to take shape.\\" Narcejac also confirmed to Richard E. Goodkin that the Orpheus myth, where the hero tries to bring his beloved back from the dead, was another source of inspiration for the novel. Publication history The novel was originally published in France as D’entre les morts in 1954. After the release of Hitchcock’s film adaptation in 1958, all subsequent French editions were retitled Sueurs froides ('Cold Sweat') to match the French release title of the film. The novel was first published in English by Hutchinson as The Living and the Dead in 1956. It was republished by Dell as Vertigo in 1958. In 2015, Pushkin Vertigo republished it as Vertigo as well. All English editions use the same translation by Geoffrey Sainsbury. Critical reception Upon its publication in English, the novel received generally positive reviews. Anthony Meredith Quinton in The Times Literary Supplement called it \\"a pure exercise in ingenuity of plot\\" but criticized the book's slow pacing: \\"When at length it comes the explanation is shocking and brilliant but not quite sufficiently so to justify the long trudge through the preliminary story.\\" The Spectator wrote that Boileau-Narcejac \\"are currently conjuring up the most ingeniously mystifying plots—and convincing explanations—in the business; and all the more so for the poker-faced style,\\" and called the novel \\"tantalising and quite irresistible like the living dead woman herself.\\" In his New York Times review, Anthony Boucher was more critical—he felt that the writers tried to replicate the tricky plotting of their earlier She Who Was No More but met with \\"unfortunate results.\\" Since then the book has been largely overshadowed by Hitchcock’s film adaptation. Robin Wood commented: \\"The drab, willful pessimism of D’entre les morts is an essentially different world from the intense traffic sense of Vertigo, which derives from a simultaneous awareness of the immense value of human relationships and their inherent incapability of perfect realization.\\" David Collard called the novel \\"a modestly competent psychological thriller\\" and added that \\"it's fair to say that it would attract little attention today had it not formed the basis of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.\\" Adaptations =Film= Vertigo (1958), US, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring James Stewart and Kim Novak =TV= La Présence des ombres (1996), Canadian- French TV film directed by Marc F.

The game is centered upon two mercenaries fighting through war, political turmoil, and a conspiracy from 1993 to 2009. Focusing on cooperative strategies, Army of Twos main feature is the necessity to use coordinated teamwork to accomplish the game's goals. While the game is meant to be played with another human as a partner, a \\"Partner Artificial Intelligence\\" (PAI) is also included and programmed to follow the player's strategies. Dependence on a partner (whether human or PAI) is so pronounced that most objectives are impossible to complete without it. Army of Two is one of the first games released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles that feature region- locked online play. EA claims that the region-locking is to prevent network lag caused by players from multiple regions, and to prevent the Asian region console owners from playing the U.S. and European version of the game, as the Asian version has been censored to meet certain requirements (notably, the shooting of already dead bodies in the game).EA explains Army of Two's Regional Lockout On August 11, 2011, Electronic Arts shut down the online multiplayer servers for the game. A sequel titled Army of Two: The 40th Day, was released on January 12, 2010. Gameplay =Gear= The player can upgrade their armor to make it better and stronger but these cannot be purchased and are unlocked as the player progresses through campaign mode. The players start with Basic body armor, upgrade to Medium after completing the Afghanistan mission, and are granted Heavy body armor after the Aircraft Carrier mission. Players can also unlock and purchase new face masks that the main characters wear. =Customization= The game allows weapon customization, bought with money earned as the game progresses. Such elements as new barrels, stocks, forend-mounted vertical grips, and extra-large magazines and ammo drums that can be swapped out to give the weapon a unique look and superior statistics. Other modifications include suppressors, a gun- shield, an underslung grenade launcher, or an underslung 12-gauge shotgun. A firing range feature was proposed that would allow the player to test out their newly customized weapon, however it was removed as it did not meet the developers' standards. \\"E3 06: Army of Two First Look\\" from GameSpot =Vehicles= The original game boasted three different drivable vehicles: a jeep, a main battle tank, and a hovercraft. Gameplay was designed so that one player would drive and the other would fire a secondary weapon like a ring- mounted XM312 heavy machine gun (jeep and hovercraft) or a 120 mm cannon (the tank). The jeep and tank were removed from the final product due to \\"pacing issues\\" and the hovercraft was used only in the China and Miami levels. =Online multiplayer= Multiplayer (or \\"Versus\\" mode) allows up to four players, with two on each team (similar to the co-op structure of the main campaign). Both teams will compete over objectives on the map such as assassinating a VIP or destroying an objective in order to earn the most money for their side. At the same time, they will also be forced to deal with the opposing team in order to secure their objectives. On August 11, 2011, the Army of Two online servers were shut down by EA due to lack of players. Multiplayer for the game was region-locked. Players with the European, American or Asian version of the game could not play with each other.'Army of Two' Won't Play Across Regions from G4 (U.S. TV channel)G4 There are three multiplayer game types: Warzone, Bounties, and Extraction. *In Warzone, the primary and secondary objectives are randomly generated and they may vary greatly. One team might need to get to a certain place and defend it, while the other team tries to destroy it, shoot down the chopper, blow up a jeep with its gunner, transport wounded soldiers to the extraction point, assassinate V.I.P's, etc. *Bounty has the player hunt down the leader of the hostile forces on the map in exchange for a sum of money. *In Extraction the objective is to rescue randomly spawned V.I.P.s or P.O.W.s to a safe location. Also, every map contains cases of intelligence documents that the player can seek out for extra cash. Character customization is not possible in the multiplayer portion of the game but the player can buy preset sets of weapons, upgrade the characters body armor and the amount of ammo he can carry. Players need to be careful while shopping though since the team with the most cash in the end wins. Plot In 1993 Somalia Elliot Salem and Tyson Rios are in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment. They are tasked to work with Phillip Clyde, a private military contractor with the Security and Strategy Corporation (SSC), tasked with carrying out the assassination of powerful local warlord Abdullahi Mo'Alim. During the aftermath of the mission, Philip Clyde invites Lieutenant Colonel Richard Dalton (CO for Salem and Rios's Ranger squad) to join the company for a desk job. He agrees, asking to bring Salem and Rios with him as contractors, and in the following year, the three enter the private sector.\\"SSC Personnel Profiles\\" from EA Salem and Rios begin work as Private Contractors. By 2001, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Salem and Rios are sent to Afghanistan to kill an Al-Qaeda terrorist named Mohammed Al-Habiib who seized a missile facility with Soviet M-11 missiles. They find and destroy the missiles, then find themselves in an area filled with noxious gas. Salem comments on how poorly they are equipped for missions and Rios sees conspiracy in this. They find fellow operative Brian Hicks beaten and poisoned in his cell and carry him to safety after successfully killing Mohammed and destroying the missile stockpiles. By 2003, Salem and Rios are sent to Iraq. Their objective here is to rescue former squad mate Lt. Col Eisenhower, whose U.S. Army base was under siege by the terrorist leader Ali Youssef. They secure Eisenhower, but before the chopper arrives, they are ambushed. Eisenhower bids them farewell before the chopper takes off, but it suddenly explodes in mid-air. Ali Youssef makes a radio transmission claiming responsibility for blowing up the chopper. Rios suspects a conspiracy behind Eisenhower's death, thinking he was singled out – Salem dismisses this, saying he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just before entering Ali Youssef's oil facility, Rios asks Section 8 to investigate the ambushes and try to find their source. Salem and Rios eventually reach Ali Youssef and kill him at his helipad. A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier has been seized by the Abu Sayyaf terrorist organization. Returning from an unspecified mission after Iraq, Salem and Rios are redirected by SSC and tasked with liberating the aircraft carrier from terrorist control. They parachute onto the deck and meet up with Clyde. They clear the deck of hostiles and disable the remaining jets to prevent escape. Salem notes that the crew left behind one lifeboat, which could be useful. Salem and Rios soon stumble upon Clyde and a terrorist collaborating by a computer. Clyde flees, but Rios retrieves his USB flash drive. He sends the information on the drive to hacker Section 8 for analysis and refuses to tell colleague Alice Murray what's happening until he hears back from him. Section 8 tells Rios that Clyde was responsible for leaking U.S. Troop positions to the terrorists. Salem and Rios then stumble upon the Captain, learning that the nuclear bomb-laden ship is on a collision course for the city of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon. The captain detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself to make sure that the ship sinks before colliding with the city. Salem and Rios escape using the lifeboat they had discovered earlier. Salem and Rios agree to quit the company. On a special mission for their arms dealer Cha Min-Soo in South Korea, they inadvertently make contact with Alice, and decide to pull off one last mission, because Salem needs the money. They are told to execute a head terrorist within Abu Sayyaf by detonating a bridge as his car crosses. They complete their objective, but find themselves under attack by the Chinese Military and wanted for murder. It is revealed that the U.S. Senator for Alaska, Richard Whitehorse, campaigning hard against a bill to privatize the military, was the one crossing the bridge. They assume Stockwell set them up, and agree to go public with the evidence they pulled off Clyde. Alice is kidnapped, however, so they head to Miami to save her and confront Stockwell. Cha Min-Soo lends them a large cargo plane and a pilot to take them there. Miami, Florida is a hurricane zone. U.S. Air Force air defenses pick up the radar trace of Cha Min-Soo's aircraft and send up two F-15's to investigate. The two operatives notice the F-15's and then find that Clyde has murdered their pilot. They engage him in battle but are interrupted when the U.S. Air Force shoots down the plane (due to the unresponsive dead pilot and sight of gunfire exiting the rear of the plane). Salem and Rios survive, and assume Clyde to be dead. They enter the Miami airport, where they are forced to engage SSC Operatives. Section 8 informs them of Alice's location, and they head on to rescue her. In the meantime, Cha Min-Soo radios them, furious that his plane was destroyed. They tell him it was Clyde's fault, and Cha Min-Soo decides he will pay them to kill him. Rios tries to tell Cha Min-Soo that Clyde already died, but Salem stops him, thinking it will be easy money. Alice reveals to them that it was, in fact, Dalton who was the mastermind behind the plot, and he plans to kill Stockwell in order to strengthen his political and military clout. Alice says they need to save Stockwell, as he is the only one who can clear their names. Salem and Rios assault the SSC headquarters to recover all of the evidence of Dalton's doing. Clyde is revealed to have survived the crash. Salem roundhouse kicks Clyde through a window, presumably killing him. They then head to the roof where Dalton is attempting to escape in a helicopter. Rios uses a Stinger missile to destroy the helicopter and kill Dalton. In the epilogue, Stockwell is revealed on a televised news report to have turned himself in and served 3 months in jail. Salem and Rios call Alice and tell her that they have started their own PMC, named Trans World Operations (T.W.O.), and invite her to join them. Downloadable content This game received two downloadable packs in 2008: =SSC Challenge Map Pack= The downloadable content (DLC) SSC Challenge Map Pack became available for download on Thursday, April 24, 2008. It added a new cooperative 2vs2 online multiplayer mode and four maps for it. =Veteran Map Pack= The downloadable content (DLC) Veteran Map Pack became available for download on Thursday, May 29, 2008. It contains a new co-op campaign map (fighting and eliminating a dangerous Russian militia group based in Kiev's subway system), an expanded Versus map (China Canal Lock), a more dynamic and interactive environment, more destructible objects, and 6 new \\"secret\\" achievements. There's also an alternative ending to the game in which the players can take on Dalton in a more dramatic boss battle at SSC's Miami headquarters in which Salem and Rios have to lock him in a vault. The online component for both add-ons was disabled when the servers were shut down, and the add-ons were delisted in 2017. Reception Army of Two received mixed reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox 360 version 74.56% and 72/100 and the PlayStation 3 version 74.31% and 74/100.

Born in Nova Scotia, British Canada, he attended Maine Wesleyan Seminary and taught school in New Bedford, Massachusetts from 1833 to 1837. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1837, and then to Lebanon, Illinois, where he taught at McKendree College (now McKendree University). He returned to Missouri and was principal of the public school at Benton from 1838 to 1847, comptroller of St. Louis from 1847 to 1850, postmaster of St. Louis from 1854 to 1858 and a member of the board of police commissioners from 1873 to 1876. Armstrong served as a member of the board of freeholders which framed the charter of St. Louis in 1876, and was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Lewis V. Bogy, serving from September 29, 1877, to January 26, 1879, when a successor was elected and qualified. Armstrong was not a candidate for reelection in 1879; and in 1893 died in St. Louis. Interment was in Bellefontaine Cemetery. Armstrong was Vice President of the St. Louis Board and helped command the July 27, 1877 cavalry attack on the strikers outside Schuler Hall, the headquarters of the Executive Committee coordinating the St. Louis General strike. He reportedly yelled from a shady side of the street for his policemen to \\"Ride 'em down!\\".

A demo of the title was made available to Xbox Live users on December 4, 2007. The demo includes two different pre-made card decks and supports both single player gameplay and local multiplayer for up to four players. Initially released in Japan in 2006, the full game wasn't released in North America until more than a year later, in February 2008, but has never been released in Europe or Australia. Story While the plot is mostly peripheral to the gameplay, the game's story concerns a young man who is sold into slavery in order to provide economic relief for his struggling village. While departing the village with his new owner, the two encounter a mysterious woman carrying a deck of magical cards which respond powerfully to the young man's presence. As the woman, Princess Faustina, pleads with the slaver to release the boy (whom she refers to as \\"the savior\\"), all three are set upon by a bandit. It is here that the young man, controlled by the player, learns that he is actually a Cepter, a powerful individual who can control magical cards. Using cards borrowed from Faustina, he overcomes the bandit and begins his journey towards becoming a master Cepter. Over multiple battles, the player must earn his or her freedom from slavery and then join with Faustina in order to defeat numerous adversaries and restore peace to the land. Gameplay Drawing a card at the start of a turn. As in Monopoly, players in Culdcept Saga roll dice and move around a game board, attempting to claim spaces and assess fees against other Cepters who land there. Unlike Monopoly, squares are claimed by summoning creatures to guard them, and players who land on them can opt to challenge this creature with one of their own rather than pay the toll. If successful, the challenger claims ownership of the square. The winner of the game is the first player to return to the starting location after amassing a sufficient quantity of magic/mana. =Cards= Creatures are summoned from customized decks (\\"books\\") of cards which players design ahead of time from their available pool of cards. Other cards in these decks bestow items to temporarily enhance creature abilities, or represent spells which can influence players or locations on the game board. The standard gameplay options fix the size of each deck at 50 cards, although this is customizable during multiplayer matches. There are nearly 500 different cards in total, but players must earn the majority of these through skillful play and story mode progression before they can be used. Cards are earned simply for completing a match, regardless of whether one wins or loses, although the winner earns a greater number of cards than the opponent(s). =Strategy= While the game relies somewhat heavily on luck, strategy and planning play a strong role as well. Players have a choice over what cards make up their decks, as well as when to play those cards. The squares in the game consist of different terrain or elemental types (fire, earth, water, or air), and a creature's defense power is raised when the element of the square is in accordance with the placed color of the creature there. Also the offensive capabilities of creatures can be bolstered by deploying them on an aligned square. Several more powerful creatures can only be summoned when a certain number of squares of a given terrain type are already controlled. Players must also decide when to upgrade the squares which they currently control. Upgraded squares exact higher magic tolls than non-upgraded squares when landed on. =New features= As a title in the roughly decade-old Culdcept series, Culdcept Saga expands upon and refines the existing gameplay concept without radically altering it. While more than 300 cards were included from the previous title, some of these were tweaked for balance, and over 100 new cards were added. New features include support for online multiplayer play against up to three other players via Xbox Live, complete with leaderboards and rankings. If desired, custom rules for such online matches can be defined in order to modify the experience. Also new to the series is the ability to unlock various items with which to graphically customize in-game avatars. Other improvements include high-resolution graphics, now rendered (at least partially) in 3D. Development The story for Culdcept Saga was written by Tow Ubukata, a science fiction and anime author. The main composer for the game's music was Kenji Ito, who worked previously on titles such as those in the SaGa series, as well as earlier Culdcept installments. The massive soundtrack spans 4 CDs, and while not released outside Japan in any physical format, is available on iTunes. Card artwork was provided by a large number of different artists from across Japan, each using their own style and imagination to come up with appropriate illustrations. The time required for the artists to complete their work and then have the images imported into the game totalled over a year. Reception Culdcept Saga has sold 27,960 copies in Japan as of November 30, 2008. Culdcept Saga generally received scores in the \\"fair\\" range from the gaming press, with scores from unofficial player reviews being somewhat higher. IGN rated the game \\"Passable\\", with a score of 6.5/10, commenting that game length can be quite excessive (4+ hours for a single match with multiple opponents) and that the game never really moves too far beyond the core \\"roll dice, play creature\\" mechanics. However, they later named the game one of the \\"hidden gems\\" of 2008. GameSpy shared concerns about the lengthy time required per match, and noted that the game could be quite frustrating when luck wasn't on one's side, although the review did note that the game included a \\"clever mix of strategy and good old-fashioned luck\\". Overall, GameSpy awarded the game a \\"Good\\" rating of 3.5/5. Both reviews expressed dismay and confusion over the way the game routinely shows what cards are in player's hands, observing that this limits elements of strategic surprise. 1UP, however, gave the game a solid B+, praising its depth and online play. GameSpot nominated it for Best Game No One Played. Gaming Target selected it as one of their \\"40 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2008.\\" References External links * Official Japanese Culdcept Saga website * OmiyaSoft's website (Japanese) * Culdcept Central (English) * Culdcept Forum (English) Category:2006 video games Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Culdcept Category:Board game-style video games Category:Card battle video games Category:Digital collectible card games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Kenji Ito Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Culdcept Saga"},{"id":"5041589","text":"T100 autocollimator An autocollimator is an optical instrument for non-contact measurement of angles. They are typically used to align components and measure deflections in optical or mechanical systems. An autocollimator works by projecting an image onto a target mirror and measuring the deflection of the returned image against a scale, either visually or by means of an electronic detector. A visual autocollimator can measure angles as small as 1 arc-second (4.85 micro-radians), while an electronic autocollimator can have up to 100 times more resolution. Visual autocollimators are often used for aligning laser rod ends and checking the face parallelism of optical windows and wedges. Electronic and digital autocollimators are used as angle measurement standards, for monitoring angular movement over long periods of time and for checking angular position repeatability in mechanical systems. Servo autocollimators are specialized compact forms of electronic autocollimators that are used in high-speed servo-feedback loops for stable-platform applications. An electronic autocollimator is typically calibrated to read the actual mirror angle. Electronic Autocollimator The electronic autocollimator is a high precision angle measurement instrument capable of measuring angular deviations with accuracy down to fractions of an arc-second, by electronic means only, with no optical eye-piece. EAC-1012 Measuring with an electronic autocollimator is fast, easy, accurate, and will frequently be the most cost effective procedure. Used extensively in workshops, tool rooms, inspection departments and quality control laboratories worldwide, these highly sensitive instruments will measure extremely small angular displacements, squareness, twist and parallelism.  Laser Analyzing Autocollimator  Today, a new technology allows to improve the Autocollimation instrument to allow direct measurements of incoming laser beams. This new capability opens a gate of inter-alignment between optics, mirrors and lasers. This technology fusion between a century-old technology of Autocollimation with recent laser technology offers a very versatile instrument capable of measurement of inter-alignment between multiple line of sights, laser in respect to mechanical datum, alignment of laser cavity, measurement of multiple rollers parallelism in roll to roll machinery, laser divergence angle and its spatial stability and many more inter-alignment applications.  Typical Applications  An Electronic Autocollimator is seldom used in the measurement of straightness of machine components (like guide ways) or the straightness of lines of motion of machine components. Flatness measurement is usually performed by measuring straightness of multiple lines along the flat surface. By correlation, it is possible to determine the flatness error of the plane. Recent advancements in applications allow angular orientation measurement of wafers. This could also be done without obstructing line of sights to the wafer's surface itself. It is applicable in wafer measuring machines and wafer processing machines. Other applications include: *Aircraft assembly jigs *Satellite testing *Steam and gas turbines *Marine propulsion machinery *Printing presses *Air compressors *Cranes *Diesel engines *Nuclear reactors *Coal conveyors *Shipbuilding and repair *Rolling mills *Rod and wire mills *Extruder barrels Optical measurement Applications: *Retro reflector Measurement *Roof prism Measurement *Optical assembly procedures *Alignment of beam delivery systems *Alignment of laser cavity *Testing perpendicularity of laser rods in respect to its axis *Real time measurement of angular stability of mirror elements.

The creator god is Yúcahu Maórocoti and he governs the growth of the staple food, the cassava. The goddess is Attabeira, who governs water, rivers, and seas. Lesser deities govern natural forces and are also zemis.Bercht et al, 23 Boinayel, the Rain Giver, is one such zemi, whose magical tears become rainfall.\\"Deity Figure (Zemi) Dominican Republic; Taino (1979.206.380)\\" In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.

Bones or skulls might be incorporated into sculptural zemis or reliquary urns. Ancestral remains would be housed in shrines and given offerings, such as food. Zemis could be consulted by medicine people for advice and healing.Corbett, Bob. Arawak/Taino Related Myths. Cuba Heritage. (retrieved 19 Sept 2009) During these consultation ceremonies, images of the zemi could be painted or tattooed on the body of a priest, who was known as a Bohuti or Buhuithu.Joyce, 195 The reliquary zemis would help their own descendants in particular.Joyce, 193 Religious art Drawing of a Taíno three-point zemi Sculptural zemis, or \\"amuletic zemis\\", take many forms, but the most characteristically Taíno art form is the three-point stone zemi. One side of the stone might have a human or animal head with the opposite side having hunched legs. These are sometimes known as \\"frog's legs\\" due to their positioning. The fierce face of the creator god is often portrayed. Very small ceramic three-point zemis have been uncovered by archaeologists in the Lesser Antilles, as well as Colombia and Venezuela, dating back to 200 BCE. Small amuletic zemis would be worn on warriors' foreheads for protection in battle.Joyce, 193 Zemis are sculpted from a wide variety of materials, including bone, clay, wood, shell, sandstone, and stone. They are found in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean islands. Some are quite large, up to 100 cm tall. Some are effigies of birds, snakes, alligators and other animals, but most are human effigies. Even twin human figures are portrayed.Bercht, 8, 14, 18, 55, 92, and 123 Wooden zemis were preserved in relatively dry caves. It is believed that Taíno people hid their ceremonial objects in caves, away from the Spanish, or destroyed them to avoid having them fall into Spanish hands.Bercht et al, 30 =Beaded zemis= Two of the most elaborate surviving zemis are housed in European museums. One is a belt with a zemi from the Greater Antilles. The belt dates from circa 1530 and is made of cotton, white and red snail shells, black seeds, pearls, glass, and obsidian. It is housed in the Museum für Völkerkunde in Vienna.Bercht et al, 159 The second is housed in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome. Until 1952, it was wrongly labeled as an African fetish, but scholars have confirmed that it is Taíno from the early 16th century and exhibits elements of Caribbean, European, and African artistic influences.

He was one of the United Kingdom's leading magicians in the 1950s and 1960s. He was hired to perform at the International of Magicians in 1962 and stayed at Jim Swoger's house in Pittsburgh, along with his wife and son, for six months before taking up residence in Los Angeles, California in the 1970s. He joined The Magic Castle in Hollywood, his number being 3323. Early life McComb was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of a physician who was knighted for his extensive contribution to X-ray research. He was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen. He then trained for a career in medicine at Queen's University, Belfast. He graduated as a doctor in 1949. Entertainer McComb decided to develop a talent he discovered at school as a magician and comedian. He made a name for himself in Ireland, then very quickly made his mark in London in the West End cabaret scene. He married June Cochrane, a former Miss Ireland and they became a performing duo. He performed before Queen Elizabeth II at a Royal Variety Performance in the early years of his career. He then began a very successful career as a magician and comedian performer aboard cruise ships internationally, with his magician's assistant, Mindy Masters. It was during this era of his career that his travels brought him to the United States. After he went to Hollywood, he made over three hundred appearances on television and in movies. He appeared in a number of television series and also opened for such stars as Bob Hope. One role was Walter Wilder in the 1995 film Lord of Illusions, directed by Clive Barker. He also appeared in the 1987 TV film Young Harry Houdini. He became a prominent figure at The Magic Castle and was affectionately billed as \\"The Worlds Largest Leprechaun.\\" In 1964 he was invited to join the Entertainment charitable fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats. In his 80s he continued to perform regularly in Las Vegas and as an opening act for The Amazing Johnathan. In his later years his act was noted for his self- deprecating jokes. In his opening he would look at his watch and say, \\"It's either this or rice pudding night at the home.\\" Books he wrote include The Professional Touch and Mc Comb's Magic: 25 Years Wiser. He was a prolific inventor of magic and illusions, most famously known for creating such items as the \\"Mc Combical Deck\\" and the \\"Double Thin Model Sawing\\" routine, in which two assistants are sawed in half, and the halves of the two assistants are switched. This world-famous routine has been used by several other magicians and was even a Jeopardy! question. He was sought after by many as the answer man in magic when a magician was having difficulty locating or developing a particular routine. Billy McComb died on April 12, 2006, aged 84, in Los Angeles, predeceased by his son, Sean McComb, who died in 2002. His widow, June McComb, died in 2007.

Kohn (May 12, 1870 – June 16, 1953) was an American architect most active in New York City.  Life and career  Kohn was born in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, and spent four years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, from 1891 through 1895. After brief stints for other architects, he established an independent practice in 1896. In 1905 he married sculptor Estelle Rumbold of St. Louis, Missouri. His first building of note was the Vienna Sezession-detailed Old New York Evening Post Building (1906–07), 20 Vesey Street, one of the limited number of Art Nouveau structures in New York. Stacks of convex copper-framed windows press forward between unrelieved limestone piers. Of the four sculpted figures in the uppermost floors, two are by Kohn's wife, and the other two are by Gutzon Borglum. He designed the hall for the Society for Ethical Culture (Central Park West and 64th Street, 1911) and had formerly collaborated with Carrère and Hastings on the adjoining Ethical Culture school building (1902). \\"Like Christian Science, the Ethical Culture movement was searching for its own form - it had no historic precedents from which to draw. Kohn's exterior, all Bedford limestone, took its cornice and base course lines from the adjacent school, but nothing else. Instead of the school's broad window facing Central Park, the meeting house has wide, limestone expanses, like a mausoleum, and simply, blocky detailing.\\" (Stern et al.) He worked in association with his brother, Victor H. Kohn, who died in New York, 4 May 1910, aged thirty-eight. In 1918 he was a founding member of the Technical Alliance, organized for the purpose of undertaking an energy survey of North America, for the reconsideration of the workings of the entire social system; their work was continued by Technocracy Inc. From 1917 through the early 1950s Kohn collaborated, formally and informally, with fellow architect Charles Butler. In the 1920s they became well known for their temples and other structures for the Reform Jewish congregations of New York, notably the discreetly modernist Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York on Fifth Avenue (1927–29) He worked in partnership with Charles Butler and Clarence Stein on this project, which cost an estimated $7.5 million dollars. The associate architects were Mayers Murray & Phillip. and for the New York Society for Ethical Culture, of which he had been a member since early youth. The Congregation Emanuel-El blends a conservative modernism with Neo-Romanesque precedents, stripped of its literal historicisms. The west end of Emanu-El, facing Central Park, is a single vastly-scaled entrance porch, infilled with stained glass under a round-headed arch. Buttressed wall permit an interior free of support, with a roof 103 feet above the floor. In 1953 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. Another regular partner was Clarence Stein. Like Stein, in the 1930s and beyond Kohn would become recognized for his expertise in low-cost housing. Kohn also became President of the American Institute of Architects in 1930–32. Congregation Emanu-El, 1927-29 World's Fair 1939 Kohn worked as the Chairman of the Committee on Theme for the 1939 World's Fair, a particularly influential body which governed almost the entirety of the expositions presented at the fair. In particular, Kohn's influence is attributed to implementing the \\"Fair of the Future\\" theme into the progressive and Beaux-Arts architecture of the exhibitors.

It entered service with the US Navy in the early 1950s, with over 3,300 produced. It was phased out of service with the US Navy during the 1970s, and the stockpiles were sold to foreign navies. Development Its engineering development began in 1946 by Westinghouse-ORL. It was largely based on the concept of the passive homing Mark 27, with added active homing system tested on modified Mark 18s, and a new torpedo body. Between 1955–56, thirty torpedoes were produced for development testing, with large-scale production commenced shortly afterwards. Due to its electric propulsion, the torpedo swam smoothly out of the launch tube, instead of having to be ejected by pressurized air, therefore significantly reducing its acoustic launch signature. To allow for water flow around the torpedo while swimming out, several 1\\" thick guide studs were attached to the torpedo, which although 19\\" in diameter was designed to be used only from 21\\" torpedo tubes.US Navy torpedo history, part 2 The guidance of a Mk37 mod 0 torpedo was done by a gyroscope control during the initial part of its trajectory, where the gyro control achieved a straight run, a passive sonar homing system, and at the last by a Doppler-enabled active sonar homing, with magnetostrictive transducers operating at 60 kHz. The electronics was based on miniature vacuum tubes, later on solid-state semiconductor devices. Modifications Israeli Mark 37E torpedo The mod 1 torpedoes were longer, slower and heavier than mod 0, but offered better target acquisition capabilities and higher ability to intercept agile submarines. They used wire-guidance. The efficiency of Mk37 torpedoes was high for targets with speed lower than and depth less than . As submarines with higher speeds and operating depths appeared, new torpedoes were developed. Of them, NT37C, D, E, and F are based on the Mk37 design. In 1967, the mod 0s started being refurbished as mod 3, and mod 1 as mod 2. These modifications involved many changes including replacement of magneto- constrictive transducers with piezoelectric ones, and resulted in target acquisition range increased from to without loss of sensitivity with increasing depth. The torpedoes used Mark 46 silver-zinc batteries. These had a known tendency to overheat, occasionally igniting or exploding. Training torpedoes used reusable rechargeable secondary batteries. For a long time, the Mark 37 was a primary U.S. submarine-launched ASW torpedo. It was replaced by the Mark 48 starting in 1972. The remaining inventory was then rebuilt and sold to several countries, including Israel, as the NT-37C after the vacuum tube guidance systems were replaced by solid-state electronics and the electric propulsion was replaced with a liquid monopropellant.Polmar, Norman \\"The Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet: Torpedoes\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings November 1978 p.160 Other uses The Mk 67 submarine launched mobile mine is based on a Mark 37 torpedo body. It entered service in 1983 and is capable of swimming as far as 10 miles through or into a channel, harbor, shallow water area and other zones which would normally be inaccessible to the vessel laying it. After reaching the target area it sinks to the sea bed and acts like a conventionally laid influence mine.

He joined the Fox News in November 2002, after working at local NBC and ABC TV stations for over ten years, as well as national networks Court TV and MSNBC. Jarrett is known for his pro-Trump commentary, and for his criticism of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In 2018, he published The Russia Hoax, which argues that the \\"deep state\\" have sought to undermine the Trump administration and protect 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He has described Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe as \\"illegitimate and corrupt\\" and likened the FBI to the KGB. Biography Jarrett was born in Los Angeles and raised in nearby San Marino, California, graduating from San Marino High School in 1973. He graduated magna cum laude from Claremont Men's College in 1977 with a degree in political science. He graduated from law school at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, in 1980, and worked as a defense attorney for several years in San Francisco with the firm of Gordon & Rees LLP. As of February 3, 2015, his California State Bar license is listed as \\"inactive.\\" Jarrett has taught law as an adjunct professor at New York Law School and lectured at other law schools. Jarrett joined Fox News in November 2002. Prior to joining Fox, Jarrett worked at MSNBC. Jarrett also worked at Court TV, now known as TruTV, for eight years, serving as the anchor of Prime Time Justice. He hosted the network's nationally syndicated half-hour magazine show, Inside America's Courts, which was seen daily on broadcast stations (NBC in New York City and Los Angeles) and weekends on CNBC. Prior to Court TV, Jarrett worked for a number of local stations. including KCSM-TV in San Francisco, California; WMDT-TV in Salisbury, Maryland; WKFT-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina and KSNW-TV in Wichita, Kansas. While at KSNW, he received a Heartland Emmy Award for the \\"Turnpike Tornado\\" news segment.  Pro-Trump commentary  Jarrett's legal commentary has generally defended President Donald Trump. In August 2017, Jarrett called for a grand jury for Hillary Clinton over her email controversy. A day later, when a grand jury was impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Jarrett said that grand juries were an \\"undemocratic farce\\". Jarrett later called the Mueller investigation \\"illegitimate and corrupt\\" on Fox News, stating that \\"the FBI has become America's secret police\\" and \\"a shadow government\\". Jarrett likened the FBI to the KGB, the Soviet security agency, for which he received PolitiFacts \\"Pants on Fire\\" rating. According to PolitiFact, \\"numerous historians of the FBI and the KGB say the comparison is ridiculous. The KGB implemented the goals of the Communist Party leadership, including countless examples of tortures and summary executions. The FBI, by contrast, is subject to the rule of law and is democratically accountable\\". In the context of possible collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government, Jarrett has said that any such collusion would not be a crime: \\"Collusion is not a crime. Only in antitrust law. You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There is no such statute.\\" According to PolitiFact, the statement is false. Three prominent election law scholars said there are at least four laws that would prohibit the sort of activities under investigation, whether those laws mention collusion or not. Jarrett's focus on a single word fails to reflect the reach of the criminal code.\\" Jarrett has said that former FBI Director James Comey may have broken the law by releasing a memo to press wherein Comey recounted a conversation with President Trump where Trump requested that Comey end the investigation into Michael Flynn. University of Texas School of Law professor Bobby Chesney said Jarrett's assertion was \\"nonsense\\". University of Georgia law professor Diane Marie Amann also refuted Jarrett's assertion. In February 2018, Jarrett asserted that he had a \\"highly reliable congressional source\\" which told him that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \\"used the power of his office to threaten members of Congress\\"; HuffPost described the assertion as \\"dubious\\". = The Russia Hoax = In 2018, Jarrett published the book The Russia Hoax which alleges that \\"Hillary Clinton’s deep state collaborators in government\\" engaged in \\"nefarious actions\\" to protect Clinton and undermine Trump. The book was an Amazon and New York Times best-seller. President Trump praised the book. According to Rolling Stone magazine, the book \\"amounts to 286 pages of recapping every single bad thing the Clintons have ever been accused of doing (Uranium One is, again, mentioned dozens of times.)... The idea that the Clinton email investigation could be dropped, and the Russia investigation taken up just a few months later isn’t seen as coincidence, but conspiracy, a bit of revenge enacted by an intelligence community full of Clinton fans.\\" In a review for The Washington Post, Carlos Lozada described the book as a Trump hagiography. In 2018, PolitiFact highlighted five claims made in Jarrett's book as false, misleading and unsubstantiated. Personal life In mid-May 2014, Jarrett requested a leave of absence from Fox for personal reasons. His leave was granted and he was replaced by other journalists with no date set for his return. Jarrett was arrested in May 2014 by Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport police, who were called to an airport bar after reports that Jarrett seemed intoxicated and acted belligerently. Jarrett was booked into Hennepin County Jail and charged with interfering with a police officer. Jarrett pleaded guilty in July 2014 to disorderly conduct in connection with the incident. CNN reported that Jarrett's arrest occurred right after Jarrett had checked out of a rehabilitation facility.Tom Kludt, Fox News releases Bob Beckel over his 'personal issues' , CNN (June 25, 2015).

Tancred's elder brother Alexander succeeded their father as count of Conversano. In 1121, Count Roger II of Sicily invaded the Basilicata to annex the county of Montescaglioso which had formerly been held by his sister Emma in right of her deceased husband Rudolf Maccabeus. In April, Tancred assisted Duke William II of Apulia and Prince Bohemond II of Taranto and Antioch in conquering the castle of Basento, within the county of Montescaglioso claimed of Roger. With the help of Pope Callistus II, a treaty, however, ended hostilities between the descendants of Tancred of Hauteville. Tancred was recognised as count of Brindisi. Tancred became part of a grand alliance of rebels, including Robert II of Capua, Ranulf II of Alife, Grimoald of Bari, Geoffrey of Andria, and Roger of Ariano. In the spring of 1129, Roger entered the peninsula with a great army to claim Apulia after William's death (1127). Many of the princes came to heel, but in the summer of 1131, when Roger left, Grimoald and Tancred revolted immediately and took the port of Brindisi and held it against Roger. In May 1132, Grimoald was taken captive and Tancred was only spared by a promise to leave on crusade. He gave up Brindisi for twenty gold coins. Tancred was preparing for a crusade when an insurrection broke out around him. He joined the revolt at Montepeloso. There he \\"dug in,\\" as Lord Norwich informs, and took command of the Apulian rebels, who held Melfi, Venosa, Barletta, and many other cities. Roger fell on them and took the central cities, cutting Tancred off from his Capuan allies and then isolated Montepeloso itself. Ranulf of Alife sent forty knights under Roger of Plenco to assist him, but other than that he was helpless. After two weeks of siege, with engines, the city capitulated and, as the rebel sympathiser Falco of Benevento, relates: :Tancred and the unfortunate Roger flung down their arms and sought refuge among the darkest and most obscure alleys of the town; but they were sought out, and discovered . . . [T]he King decreed that Roger should forthwith be hanged by the neck, and that Tancred himself, with his own hand, should pull on the rope. Tancred was led of imprisoned to Sicily and disappears into the mists of time. Sources *Lexikon de Mittelalters. *Falco of Benevento. Chronicon Beneventanum. *Norwich, John Julius.

Swiss authorities helped them settle in Canton of Jura. Historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files commented that Switzerland's grant of Asylum preserved the Obama Presidency from political embarrassment, because all the Uyghurs had been offered a new home, except for Arkin Mahmud, and that the Swiss offer of asylum would complicate the habeas petitions of the four remaining Uyghur captives who had declined to agree to accept refugee status in Palau.

The economy is mostly based on agriculture, including production of renowned oil and wine, as well as traditional food. Historically, it was the centre of a county in the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. History The first settlements in the area date from the 7th century BC, belonging to the Apuli Italic tribe. The original nucleus of Montescaglioso grew substantially in the following centuries, thanks to trade with the nearby Greek town of Metaponto. When the latter decayed in Roman times, Montescaglioso further increased in importance. Archaeological findings include a large tuff wall dating from the 3rd century BC. After the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Montescaglioso is mentioned first only in early medieval times. A Byzantine stronghold, it was captured by the Normans after the year 1000, and housed an important Benedictine community. Under the Angevin and Aragonese dynasties of the Kingdom of Naples, it belonged in sequence to the D'Avalos, Orsini, Loffredo, Grillo and Cattaneo feudal families.  Territorial abbacy of San Michele Arcangelo di Montescaglioso The Benedictine Territorial Abbey (i.e. exerting diocesan authority over itself and the surrounding territory, instead of resorting under a bishop) of San Michele Arcangelo, exists at least from 1078 and was probably built in the 5th century. The Norman lord Humphrey of Hauteville and his son Rudolph made large donations to the abbey, which flourished until the 15th century. Afterwards it decayed due to numerous wars ravaging the country in those years. The Abbey Church (12th century), dedicated to St. Michael, has a notable portal and a Norman-style bell tower with mullioned windows. Renewed starting from 1590, it received a cylindrical cupola in 1650. It lost its autonomous prelature status on 5 August 1910, when it was united (as a mere title) with the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Acerenza–Matera, but since its split the abbacy is united with the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Matera.

Business and Professional Women's Foundation (BPW) is an organization that promotes workforce development programs and workplace policies to acknowledge the needs of working women, communities and businesses. It supports the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. Current issues * Successful Workplaces Movement * Pay equity * Support for women veterans * Contraceptive equity * Family time flexible leave * Equal Rights Amendment Structure The work of BPW Foundation is supported through corporate partnerships, grants and individual philanthropic donations. Its Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) number is 10506. It is governed by a Board of Trustees. History The legacy of Business and Professional Women/USA began in 1919. While mobilizing for World War I, the U.S. Government recognized the need for a cohesive group to coordinate identification of women's available skills and experience. A Women's War Council, financed through a federal grant, was established by the War Department to organize the resources of professional women. It was guided principally by executives of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). The National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs was founded on July 16, 1919, at a meeting led by Lena Madesin Phillips of Kentucky. In the 1930s it became a charter member of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women. BPW/USA became the first organization created to focus on the issues of working women. BPW worked throughout the 1930s to prohibit legislation or directives denying jobs to married women and lobbied successfully to legislatively end the legal practice of workplace preference for unmarried persons and, in the case of married persons, preference for males. BPW/USA was one of the first women's organizations to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment in 1937. At the advent of World War II, BPW developed a classification system for women with specialized skills critical to the war effort and supported the formation of women's branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. While wage discrimination has existed in the U.S. since women and minorities first entered the paid workforce, its prevalence was not felt until the massive influx of women sought work during World War II. Immediately following the war, the Women's Pay Act of 1945 - the first ever legislation to require equal pay - was introduced in the U.S. Congress. It was another 18 years before an equal pay bill made its way to the President's desk to be signed into law. BPW Foundation was incorporated in 1956 as the first foundation dedicated to providing resources to and about working women. It included research, information, career development programs, workshops and other training opportunities. The Marguerite Rawalt Resource Center, established in 1980 and put on-line 2006, is a major resource for information and documents on the history of women and women in the workplace. The establishment of \\"Status of Women\\" commissions in the U.S. in 1963 was due largely to BPW efforts. President John F. Kennedy recognized BPW's leading role in securing passage of the Equal Pay Act by giving BPW's National President the first pen he used when signing the Act into law. Virginia Allan initiated the \\"Young Careerist\\" Program to develop the business and presentation skills of young women between 25–35 years of age. The first National Legislative Conference, held in 1963 in D.C., later developed into BPW's current Policy & Action Conference, where members lobby Congress and the Administration on BPW's legislative issues. BPW tackled \\"comparable worth\\" by calling for newspapers to stop the occupational segregation in classified ads (clustering of women in a few restricted occupations of low-paying, dead-end jobs). Numerous state and municipal governments revamped their pay scales, recognizing dissimilar jobs may not be identical, but may be composed of tasks, educational requirements, experience and other characteristics that are equivalent or comparable. In 1986, San Francisco became the first city in the nation to approve a pay equity referendum, implementing $34 million in increases for employees in female and minority-dominated jobs. Continuing with BPW's focus on workplace issues, BPW lobbied Congress for passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which finally passed in 1993. Discussions on comparable worth were expanded to include enforcement and strengthening of existing Equal Pay legislation. The Pay Equity Employment Act of 1994, followed by the Equal Pay Act (introduced in 1994) and the Paycheck Fairness Act (introduced in 1997) became BPW's focus legislation through the '90s. Then-Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, and First Lady Barbara Bush addressed BPW's members at the White House Briefing during the 1990 \\"Lobby Day\\" event. Subsequent speakers have included Senator Tom Harkin, First Lady (Senator) Hillary Clinton and Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Eleanor Holmes Norton. In 2005, BPW used its grassroots power to continue the Bureau of Labor and Statistics' (BLS) Working Women Series and to re-instate Lifetime TV on the DISH Network programming. During this same year in October, BPW/USA launched Women Joining Forces:Closing Ranks, Opening Doors (WJF), a program to support women veterans as they transition from military to civilian life. This commitment made BPW/USA the first and only non-governmental agency to offer programming that supports women veterans. Workplace equity issues including sexual harassment, opportunities for women veterans, work-life balance, health care reform, dependent care, tort reform, increasing the minimum wage, lifetime economic security and pay equity continue to be BPW's targeted issues. In 2009 BPW Foundation merged with its sister organization BPW/USA.

After retiring from football, White has worked as a coach and artist.http://edwhiteart.com/Fox Sports article: \\"One on one with Kyle Turley .\\" Retrieved 07 May 2008. Biography He graduated from Indio High School in Indio, California. In college, White played for the University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears (1966-68) as a lineman and was selected a consensus All- American player in 1968. White began his professional football career with the Minnesota Vikings after being drafted in the second round of the 1969 AFL/NFL draft. He is one of 11 players to have played in all four Vikings Super Bowl appearances between 1969 and 1976. Before the 1978 season, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers, with whom he played until 1985 when he retired after 17 years and 241 games. Mainly used at offensive guard, he was selected to the Pro Bowl four times. He played as an offensive lineman for the Chargers 1978-85. After retiring from the NFL, White worked as a football coach. =Awards and honors= Following his retirement, he was inducted into College Football Hall of Fame, University of California Hall of Fame, Breitbard Hall of Fame, East-West Shrine Game Hall of Fame, and the San Diego Charger Hall of Fame. Indio High School named their football field Ed White Stadium in honor of White. As a testament to his impact on every team he played on, in 2015 Ed White was selected to the Pac-12 All Century Football team, playing defensive tackle at Cal. Charger quarterback Dan Fouts has been vocal about endorsing White for the Pro Football Hall of Fame: “When he retired, nobody had played in more games (241) as an offensive lineman than Ed White. They don’t have many statistics for offensive linemen other than Pro Bowls and Super Bowls, but Ed would be a leader. He was one of the most feared offensive linemen in the game. You talk to guys like Howie Long and Matt Millen who had to go against Big Ed. They hated it.” Chargers center/guard Dennis McKnight has called White “probably the best all-around offensive lineman in the league in terms of run blocking and pass blocking.” Kansas City Chiefs offensive tackle Kyle Turley has called White the best coach he'd ever had. In 2019, the Professional Football Researchers Association named White to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2019  References  External links *Ed White Studio *\\"Being Big Ed: A Portrait of the Artist as an Aging NFL Lineman\\" by Pat Joseph, California magazine, Spring 2011.

It is based on the novel How My Private, Personal Journal Became A Bestseller by Julia DeVillers. Sisters Kay and Danielle Panabaker star as Jamie Bartlett and her alter ego Isabella (Iz or Is), respectively. Both sisters have starred in previous Disney Channel films: Kay in Life Is Ruff (2005), and Danielle in Stuck in the Suburbs (2004), like Read It and Weep, those films also premiered in July in their respective years. Plot Read It and Weep begins with freshman Jameson \\"Jamie\\" Bartlett (Kay Panabaker) who has three best friends named Connor (who has a crush on her) (Jason Dolley), Lindsay (Marquise Brown) and Harmony (Alexandra Krosney) a brother named Lenny Bartlett (Nick Whitaker) and a very mean enemy named Sawyer Sullivan (Allison Scagliotti) (who she calls \\"Myrna\\" in her journal and the novel) whose boyfriend Marco is the object of Jamie's affection. She also owns a tablet PC which she writes in every day. In that journal she writes about a character named \\"Isabella\\" or \\"Is\\" (Danielle Panabaker) a popular girl with incredible powers based loosely on herself. Jamie uses her tablet PC as her own little universe, where she tells about different people, and stories, but in actuality is her own life, just a little more imaginative. As an English assignment, she has to write an essay of her choice. Her printer dies and Lenny refuses to let her use his. Lindsay offers to print the essay if Jamie emails it to her, but she accidentally sends her the journal. After Lindsay turns the journal in for the English assignment, it wins a writing contest. Jamie's book attracts a lot of publicity and eventually becomes a bestseller. She appears at many book signings, reality TV shows, is often interviewed, and meets stars whom she has always wanted to meet. Soon, success gets the better of Jamie; she becomes increasingly materialistic and critical of the world around her, quitting her job at her father's pizza place, ridiculing her brother's guitar playing and favoring fame over her friends. Her newfound popularity is dashed when she inadvertently reveals on a television interview that the antagonist of her novel is based on Sawyer and all of her other life dramas. As Jamie's classmates learn that the book was based on Jamie's negative feelings toward her school, she wishes to restore her relationships but her friends are unwilling to trust her again. Her friends begin to reject and avoid her. To make up for her mistakes, she apologizes to her brother, Lenny, encouraging him to take up his guitar playing once more, despite what she'd said. Jamie overhears her parents' conversation about having to close down the pizza parlor, and Jamie feels guilty. As she is getting ready for the school dance, Jamie confronts Is, a figment of her imagination who tries to make Jamie like she is and acts as the main antagonist of the movie (next to Sawyer/Myrna), and tells her to stop. She then goes to the dance, where she tries to apologize to everyone. They do not accept her apology at first, but gradually do after learning the book was really Jamie's personal journal and that she never meant for it to be published. Jamie finds Connor just as he is leaving. She asks for his forgiveness and they kiss. They walk back into the dance, where Lenny performs a song (\\"I Will Be Around\\") dedicated to Jamie. After the dance, which was ocean-themed, Jamie invites everyone to eat at her parents' pizza parlor. When Lenny rushes into the kitchen to help cook the pizza, his jacket, which was covered in seaweed from the dance, accidentally lands on some of the pizzas, covering them in seaweed. When the pizza is delivered to the customers, they love it, and Jamie's father finally figures out the secret of how to save their business, ending the film on a happy note.

The film is one of two Hollywood musicals with an African American cast released in 1943, the other being MGM's Cabin in the Sky. The film is considered a primary showcase of some of the leading African American performers of the day, during an era when African American actors and singers rarely appeared in lead roles in mainstream Hollywood productions. Overview Stormy Weather takes its title from the 1933 song of the same title, which is performed almost an hour into the film. It is based upon the life and times of its star, dancer Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson. Robinson plays Bill Williamson, a talented born dancer who returns home in 1918 after serving in World War I and tries to pursue a career as a performer. Along the way, he approaches a beautiful singer named Selina Rogers (Lena Horne). The character of Selina was invented for the film; Robinson did not have such a romance in real life. Dooley Wilson co-stars as Bill's perpetually broke friend and Emmett \\"Babe\\" Wallace co-stars as her manager, Chick Bailey, vying for Lena’s hand. Left to right: left Other performers in the movie were Cab Calloway and Fats Waller (both appearing as themselves), the Nicholas Brothers dancing duo, comedian F. E. Miller, singer Ada Brown, and Katherine Dunham with her dance troupe. Despite a running time of only 77 minutes, the film features some 20 musical numbers. This was Robinson's final film (he died in 1949); Waller died only a few months after its release. The film's musical highlights include Waller performing his composition \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", Cab Calloway leading his band in his composition \\"Jumpin' Jive\\", and a lengthy sequence built around the title song, featuring the vocals of Lena Horne and the dancing of Katherine Dunham. Horne also performs in several dance numbers with Robinson. It was one of her few non-MGM film appearances, and one of only two films from the 1930s-1940s in which Horne played a substantial role. Ford Dabney was a consultant on the music for the film.Ford Dabney at AllMusic The movie was adapted by Frederick J. Jackson, Ted Koehler and H.S. Kraft from the story by Jerry Horwin and Seymour B. Robinson. It was directed by Andrew L. Stone. The original release prints of Stormy Weather were processed in sepiatone. In 2001, Stormy Weather was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" It was released on DVD in North America in 2005. Soundtrack The soundtrack has been released on CD by 20th Century Fox references 7822-11007, though Sunbeam Records released the soundtrack on vinyl in 1976. The Soundtrack Factory CD includes Lena Horne singing \\"Good For Nothin' Joe\\", a song that did not appear in the movie.

Fred Astaire told the Nicholas Brothers that the \\"Jumpin' Jive\\" dance sequence was \\"the greatest movie musical number he had ever seen\\". Performance The musical numbers in the movie contain elements of minstrelsy. The performance of a cakewalk for example, features flower headdresses reminiscent of the Little Black Sambo figures used in historical misrepresentations of Black American males. Stormy Weather and other musicals of the 1940s opened new roles for blacks in Hollywood, breaking through old stereotypes and far surpassing limited roles previously available in race films produced for all-black audiences.Frank N.

The results, nowadays referred to as \\"Mindlin's problem\\", represent a generalization of the two classical 19th century solutions respectively associated with the names of Kelvin and Boussinesq, and have become the basis for analytical formulations widely employed in geotechnical engineering. His paper was published in Physics (now the Journal of Applied Physics) in 1936, the year Mindlin received his Ph.D. degree. Mindlin remained an assistant for another two years, at which point he was elevated to instructor in civil engineering, and only in 1940 did he receive promotion to assistant professor. In 1942 Mindlin was co-opted by the Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, an institution engaged in naval ordnance work, where he contributed in the development of the proximity fuze. For his part in its success, he was presented with the Presidential Medal for Merit. He came back to Columbia in 1945 as an associate professor, and two years later attained the rank of professor. In 1967 he was appointed James Kip Finch Professor of Applied Science until his retirement in 1975.

One of the advantages of co-firing is that an existing plant can be used to burn a new fuel, which may be cheaper or more environmentally friendly. For example, biomass is sometimes co-fired in existing coal plants instead of new biomass plants. Another example is that biomass primary fuel fractions can be cofired with waste-derived fuels in biomass plants leading to an environmentally friendly destruction of waste fractions and cost-effective heat and power production. Co-firing can also be used to improve the combustion of fuels with low energy content. For example, landfill gas contains a large amount of carbon dioxide, which is non-combustible. If the landfill gas is burned without removing the carbon dioxide, the equipment may not perform properly or emissions of pollutants may increase. Co-firing it with natural gas increases the heat content of the fuel and improves combustion and equipment performance. As long as the electricity or heat produced with the biomass and landfill gas was otherwise going to be produced with non-renewable fuels, the benefits are essentially equivalent whether they are cofired or combusted alone. Also, co-firing can be used to lower the emission of some pollutants. For example, co-firing biomass with coal results in less sulfur emissions than burning coal by itself.  Origin  Co-firing (also referred to as complementary firing or co-combustion) is the combustion of two different fuels in the same combustion system. Fuels can be solid fuels, liquid fuels or gaseous, and its source either fossil or renewable. Therefore, use of heavy fuel oil assisting coal power stations may technically be considered co-firing. However, the term co-firing is used in the present technological framework to designate combined combustion of two (or more) fuels sustained in time, as a normal daily practice. The interest in co-firing and the use of this term sprung up in the 1980s in the U.S. and Europe, and referred specifically to the use of waste solid residues (paper, plastic, solvents, tars, etc.) or biomass in coal power stations that were designed only for the combustion of coal, and attempted, because of the existence of those new opportunity fuels, to carry out a combined combustion in order to increase benefit margins. This interest in co-firing has grown in the last decade mainly due to increasing social concern about global warming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The consequences of this concern are new policies on energy and the environment aimed at reducing emissions. Co-firing is regarded as a great opportunity for replacing coal (solid fossil fuel) used for power generation with renewable fuels (biomass) with lower costs and a direct decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. During the last few decades research has provided very diverse solutions for co-firing biomass in coal power stations with a limited impact on efficiency, operation and lifespan. In the present context the definition of co-firing could be: The use together of two (or more) fuels, the primary being fossil and the secondary from another source (renewable or residual), in a boiler originally designed for fossil fuel, either using the original combustion system or additional devices.  Types  The concept of co-firing is quite simple. It consists in the use of two or more fuels inside the same combustion device. It is applicable to all kind of combustion systems traditionally used for power generation (pulverized fuel, fluidized bed combustion and grate firing). Co-firing in cement kilns is already a quite widespread solution for valorization of waste materials mostly, as well as for biomass. The iron industry (blast furnace) and domestic sector (coal stoves) are also sectors where co-firing could be implemented. The use of a secondary fuel (biomass or waste) replacing a share of the original fossil fuel may require trivial changes in the facility, or a complete retrofitting with important reforms. Modifications will depend on the characteristics of the fuels, the original combustion technology, the plant layout and the type and location of auxiliary systems. The percentage of original fuel replaced, also known as co-firing rate (either expressed in mass or in energy basis) is furthermore a definitive parameter limiting the technical solutions valid for a specific plant. The co-firing systems, according to the current state of the art and the future perspectives, can be classified into direct and indirect co-firing technologies. The former refer to those systems where combustion of both fuels takes place at the same combustion device or into the same boiler simultaneously. The secondary fuel (biomass, waste) may be either mixed with coal before the combustion starts or fed by a separate device, e.g. specific biomass burners. Indirect co-firing, on the contrary, separates the combustion of both solid fuels, though Combustion Gasses may be mixed afterwards. Direct biomass co-firing systems entail advantages of simplicity and economics. However direct co-firing systems are also more sensitive to variations in fuel quality and heterogeneity. Additionally other problems limit the rate of secondary fuel replacing the original fossil fuels. In example ash deposition (fouling and slagging) and corrosion usually increase with the use of biomass and wastes replacing coal, what may shorten the lifespan of diverse devices in contact with Combustion Gasses like superheaters, heat exchangers, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), etc. Direct co-firing systems include next technological solutions: * Co-milling (in case of solid fuels): blending of primary (coal) and secondary (biomass or waste) fuel, combined milling (in original system) and injection through the coal burners (or feeding system) * Co-feeding: separate treatment of primary and secondary fuels (milling in case of solid fuels), and incorporation of secondary fuel to the main flow. In case of solid fuels the mixture takes place downstream the coal mill. * Combined burner: fuels are treated separately (milled in case of solid fuels) and transported to the burner, where primary fuel uses the original ports and secondary fuel uses new ports or unused ducts. In this case, though feeding does not involve fuel physical mixing, combustion stages takes place simultaneously and with similar aerodynamics to original design. * New burners: fuels use independent feeding lines. Primary fuel uses original injection system, whereas secondary fuel is transported to specific dedicated burners or inlet ports penetrating into the combustion chamber. New burners (injection systems) may replace former burners of primary fossil fuel, or may be installed in new positions in the combustion chamber. This option may involve the use of different combustion systems. For example, in a pulverized coal power station a grate firing system may be installed at the bottom of the combustion chamber, though this solution is rare. Indirect co-firing systems imply usually more complex and expensive solutions, but they reduce usually problems related with corrosion, fouling, slagging, etc. This, a priori, allows co-firing rates larger than direct systems, that is, larger percentages of coal substituted by biomass or waste. In addition, indirect co-firing systems are in general better for fuel mixtures where secondary fuel may include potential contaminants like heavy metals or other dangerous inorganic compounds. Main indirect co-firing systems are listed next: * Separated burning: burning of secondary fuel in a separate boiler or system and introduction of flue gases downstream the radiant section of the original boiler. * Coupled plant: separate burning in a new boiler specially designed and built for firing the secondary fuel. Original and new system couple their heating fluid circuits. Combustion gases are not mixed and Exhaust gas must be treated separately. * Gasification systems: the secondary fuel is transformed into gas (with heating value) by means of a gasifier. The resulting syngas is either directly or with a previous treatment, injected in the original combustion chamber or boiler through new dedicated ducts. * Pyrolysis: biomass is transformed into a mixture of gas, bio-oils and char by means of pyrolysis. Fractions may be separated and introduced into the boiler in different sites.  Advantages of co-firing  Use of biomass in co-firing incorporate additional environmental, socio-economic and strategy advantages regarding the use of biomass in dedicated biomass plants. In case of waste residues there are no additional benefits, however the combustion of waste may change the emissions regulations to satisfy more strict regulations. For example, limits in emissions from environmental regulations for large scale combustion facilities are more permissive than regulations for incineration plants. Except for the previous drawback related to waste co-firing, the following advantages are common for waste and biomass co-firing: * Specific investment (per unit of installed power): reduced in comparison with conventional biomass facilities since plant using fossil fuel already exists and only diverse modifications are required * Power generation with better efficiency: generally biomass power plants produce electricity with relative low efficiency (18 to 22%) compared with the huge coal units (32 to 38%) with optimised cycles given the economy of scale * Flexible operation: original plant can operate still at 100% load with fossil fuel. Co-firing facility is less sensitive to seasonality in biomass production and to biomass availability and price * Carrot for development of biomass markets: diverse European countries have proven the promotion of co- firing is a key for the development of biomass markets as well as for the creation of expertise on biomass handling and combustion  External links  * USDOE United States Department of Energy *EUBIA - European Biomass Industry Association *IEA - International Energy Agency *ACVCOCO Project: Determination of the real potential of greenhouse emissions reduction in Spain by means of the co-firing implementation *CIRCE - Co-firing of low rank coal and biomass: a chance for biomass penetration in the renewables *Janne Kärki et al., Toward Carbon-Negative Power Plants With Biomass Cofiring and CCS Category:Combustion Category:Incineration ","title":"Cofiring"},{"id":"5042026","text":"Iowa Highway 32 (Iowa 32), also known as the Northwest Arterial, was a state highway that ran through the northwest quadrant of Dubuque. At just over long, it was among the shortest state highways in the state. The highway began at U.S. Highway 20 in Dubuque and ended at US 52 / Iowa 3 in Sageville. With the exception of a small portion at the northern end, the entire highway was within the Dubuque city limits. Route description A section of Iowa Highway 32 north of the intersection with John F. Kennedy Road. Iowa Highway 32 began at an intersection with US 20 in Dubuque. From US 20, Iowa 32 headed north and immediately dropped in elevation into the valley of the middle fork of Catfish Creek. It headed back uphill and intersected Pennsylvania Avenue. north of this intersection was another intersection with Asbury Road, named for the small town located west of the intersection. North of Asbury Road, the Northwest Arterial was flanked on both sides of the road by retail establishments, most of which popped up in the early-2000s. The highway made a 45° turn to the northeast, heading towards Sageville. Just to the northeast was an intersection with John F. Kennedy Road (JFK), which for the first six years of Iowa 32's existence, was the northern end of the route. Northeast of JFK, the highway passed the Dubuque Arboretum and Botanical Gardens. Just to the northeast of the arboretum was the intersection with US 52 / Iowa 3 in Sageville. History Iowa 32 was originally envisioned in the 1970s as part of Dubuque's long-range transportation improvement plan. The road was planned as a four-lane highway bypass and alternate route to U.S. 52, which runs as a city street through Downtown Dubuque. Construction began in the early 1980s on a two-lane section, which stretched from U.S. 20 (Dodge Street) to John F. Kennedy Road. The city turned the highway over to state control in 1995, where it was marked as Iowa Highway 32. By 1997, work was finished on the additional two lanes, and the road was a four-lane divided highway. In 2002, the state completed a four-lane extension of the highway north to US 52 / Iowa 3, creating a bypass from US 20 to US 52 / Iowa 3. Since the completion of the highway, there has been significant growth along the Northwest Arterial corridor. The largest developments include Asbury Plaza, Iowa's 8th-largest shopping center, and Medical Associates Clinic's West Campus. In addition to these, several business parks and residential subdivisions have been built in the corridor. This growth, and its subsequent increase in traffic, has placed strains on the road, and has led to the installation of numerous stoplights. The growth has also led to more traffic accidents, particularly at the Asbury Road and U.S. 20 (Dodge Street) intersections. The Northwest Arterial is the third highway to be designated as Iowa 32. The first Highway 32 was in Cherokee County, Iowa, extending from Iowa Highway 5 to Cleghorn, Iowa, and was in existence from 1920 to 1926. A route from Iowa Highway 9 near Spirit Lake, Iowa to U.S. Highway 71 in Milford, Iowa served as the second Iowa Highway 32 from 1934 to 1980. In April 2013, the city of Dubuque and surrounding jurisdictions proposed rerouting US 52 so that it would go from Luxemburg to Dyersville to meet up with US 20 and from there the highway would share an alignment with US 20 until reaching the as-yet-unbuilt Southwest Arterial. US 52 would then be routed onto the Southwest Arterial, bypassing the city of Dubuque and heading southwest to US 61 / US 151, where it would then be linked to the existing highway US 52 onto Bellevue and Sabula. The Iowa Transportation Commission approved turning the highway over to the cities of Dubuque and Sageville at their meeting January 10, 2017.

It is the story of Azuri, an Orcan (human/orca hybrid) bethrothed to Prince Unagi, the leader of Eels, as part of a peace offering. Things complicate, however, when she falls in love with Thalo, her Orcan guard and childhood best friend. Plot Azuri is to marry Unagi, and despite Thalo's efforts to remain indifferent, Thalo isn't happy. He does, however, \\"stand by\\" while the Eel Prince courts the Orcan Princess, all the while he and Azuri try to convince themselves that they are not actually in love. At the ball to celebrate Unagi's arrival to the kingdom of Orca, Azuri performs an ancient Orcan Bridal Ritual. With her Breath Blast Attack, she shatters the ceremonial ice platform on which she danced with a single note. In Volume 2, things heat up as Prince Unagi notices the sweet nothings that Princess Azuri and Thalo are unable to hide. He sets in motion a plan to drive Thalo out of the kingdom, by setting him up to take the fall for crimes the young Orcan didn't commit. His servant Scample sabotages the Great Ballroom to collapse in on itself while Thalo and Azuri are on top of it, so that Thalo will take the blame. In Volume 3 (never published), Unagi's real reasons for setting up the marriage between himself and Princess Azuri become clear. He intends to marry the princess and murder the queen, thereby assuming rule of both kingdoms. Azuri finds out and runs away before they can be married, stalling his plan. She seeks out Thalo, who was turned into a human and banished from the kingdom to live on land—a cruel joke to any mer-person.

Froment is best remembered for his role in initiating and solidifying the Reformation in Geneva along with William Farel and John Calvin. His role in these events, however, is smaller compared to the tremendous accomplishments of Farel and Calvin. Early life Froment was born in Mens, a town in the Dauphiné, and received a typical Christian education. He spent a few years as deacon of a town outside of Geneva, and then at the age of 33 was made a pastor. He and his wife, Marie Dentière, remained active in the Genevan church despite their residency outside the city. Like her husband, Dentière was a vocal reformer and theologian with fiery, outspoken views. Geneva Reformation After the people of Geneva had successfully overthrown their prince-bishop, Duke Charles III of Savoy in 1533, Protestant leaders acted swiftly to influence the Genevans to their side. With the convincing of William Farel and his accomplice Froment, the government officially supported the Reformation in 1536. Both Farel and Froment were supported by the city of Bern to fulfill this goal. While in Geneva, Froment founded a school and offered a free education in French reading and writing to anyone who would listen, and used the classroom as a forum for sermons and Romanist criticism. However at the time townspeople were strongly averse to the stringent religious ideas of Froment and Calvin, and during an outdoor sermon Froment was interrupted by angry clergy and townspeople and forced to flee. He often secretly returned to the city to assist his fellow reformers. Froment's role in the new church was replaced by Pierre Viret. Later life By the early 1540s Froment had abandoned his involvement in the church and opened a small shop. By that time Calvin and Farel had begun to show feelings of bitter animosity and vexation towards him, and more especially towards his wife Marie. Calvin's words show a particular dislike towards Froment's career duality as shopkeeper and preacher. A month before his death, Calvin wrote a letter to his colleagues recounting his first arrival at Geneva, writing: * \\"...In addition, there was Master Antoine Saunier, and that superb preacher Froment who, having taken off his apron, would ascend the pulpit, and would afterwards go back to his shop, where he gossiped away and so preached twice over.\\" In 1548, Froment was again forced to flee after delivering an inflammatory sermon, this time criticizing local reformed church leaders for making profits and lacking Reformation fervor. Beginning in 1549, Froment assisted Bonivard in the creation of the Chronicle of the Republic, a major accomplishment in Froment's life. For the next decade or so, Froment lived as a notary, until in 1561, after marrying a second time following the death of his wife, he was convicted of adultery with a servant and banished for 10 years. As a recognition of his assistance in the Reformation efforts, he was allowed to live in Geneva, again as a notary, until his death in 1581. References *Lewis W. Spitz (1985).

Sometimes known as H. J. Ford or Henry J. Ford, he came to public attention when he provided the numerous beautiful illustrations for Andrew Lang's Fairy Books, which captured the imagination of a generation of British children and were sold worldwide in the 1880s and 1890s.  Early years  After education at Repton School and Clare College, Cambridge - where he gained a first class in the Classical Tripos in 1882 - Ford returned to London to study at the Slade School of Fine Art and later, at the Bushey School of Art, under the German- born Hubert von Herkomer.  Career  In 1892, Ford began exhibiting paintings of historical subjects and landscapes at the Royal Academy of Art exhibitions. However it was his illustrations for such books as The Arabian Nights Entertainments (Longmans 1898), Kenilworth (TC & EC Jack 1900) and A School History of England by C. R. L. Fletcher and Rudyard Kipling (Clarendon Press 1911) that provided Ford with both income and fame.  Family  Richard John Cuninghame (1871–1925) His parents were Katherine Mary Justice and William Augustus Ford; his paternal grandfather was George Samuel Ford, a well known bill discounter. His father, (a solicitor by profession) and many of his family were cricketers. His father wrote a number of articles and books on the subject and Ford's brother, Francis Ford (1866-1940) played for England in an Ashes series in Australia. At the age of 61, Ford surprised his friends by marrying a woman some thirty-five years younger. She was Emily Amelia Hoff (née Rose), a widow whose first husband had been killed in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. Following the marriage in Kensington Register Office in February 1921, Henry and Emily Ford settled down in Bedford Gardens, Kensington for several years and, in 1927, the couple adopted a child, June Mary Magdelene Ford. The seated model in Henry Justice Ford's painting 'Remembering Happier Things', now in the collection of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery, Bournemouth, bears a strong resemblance to Ford's wife, Emily.  Hobbies  His love of the game led Henry Justice Ford to play cricket regularly with the playwright JM Barrie's Allahakbarrie Cricket Club. This in turn led to Ford providing the well-known map of Kensington Gardens in Barrie's 'The Little White Bird.' He also designed the costume for the character of Peter Pan when Barrie's play was staged in the West End for the first time in 1904. Ford's wide-ranging interests brought him into contact and friendship with many well-known figures of his time, including the writers PG Wodehouse, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and AEW Mason.

Grand Rabbi Yehoshua Heshel Rosenbaum of Cleveland-New York Rebbe, There are two Hasidic Jewish dynasties known as Cleveland and both are considered to be a part of the Nadvorna dynasty.  History of the Clevelander New York dynasty The Cleveland Hasidic dynasty currently located in Williamsburg, New York, was founded by Grand Rabbi Meir Leifer, who died in Los Angeles, California in 1941. The first Clevelander Rebbe was the author of Oros Hameirim, Likitei Amorim, and Hakufes Nadvorne. He was a scion of the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty. He also was a disciple of Rabbi Moshe Greenwald of Chust, author of Arugas Habosem. He founded the current synagogue in Williamsburg in 1934 after he moved there from Cleveland, Ohio, making it currently the oldest Hasidic dynasty in Williamsburg. Reb Meir came to USA in 1922, and settled in Cleveland where he was the first rabbi of Congregation Bnei Yaakov Anshei Marmorish (currently known as the Green Road Synagogue Beis Ha Knesseth Shearis Hapleita Bnei Yaakov Kehilas Marmorsh), Glenville and later he founded the congregations Shomrei Shabbos, and Shomer Hadass Yisroel. Prior to living in the USA, Reb Meir lived in Budapest, Hungary, where he led a large following. Reb Meir was succeeded by his son-in-law, Grand Rabbi Usher Mordechai Rosenbaum, author of Sifsei Riem, and Amoirois Tehoirois. In 1962 Reb Usher Mordechai founded the Clevelander yeshiva under the name of Yeshivas Bnei Mordechai. In 1981 the yeshiva was renamed Yeshivas Bnei Yisachar Ber. Reb Usher Mordechai also founded a kollel under the name of Kollel Yad Issumer.

The name \\"Orlem\\" is often colloquially used for the Our Lady of Lourdes parish in Malad, which includes Orlem and its neighboring areas.Our Lady of Lourdes The original name of Orlem in the official language of the state (Marathi) is Valnai. The Indian postal zip code 400064 serves the Orlem neighborhood. History A 2008 view of Orlem Orlem originally primarily consisted of a population of Roman Catholics. The main ethnic group within the Catholic community were East Indians followed by Goans, Mangloreans and other regional communities. Joseph Maria Braz de Souza, of the Principal family of Valnai, built a private chapel at his own expense in 1880 dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes at Orlem. He was a former chaplain of military forces at Satara from 1861 to 1886. In 1882, Bishop Leo Meurin declared officially that this chapel, under the chaplainship of Fr. D'Souza was part of the Apostolate of Bombay and affiliated to the church of Our Lady of Assumption, Kandivli. In 1908, Fr. D'Souza was elevated to the dignity of CAMARIERE SEGREDO EXTRA URBEM to Pius X. He died in December 1912 and was buried in the sanctuary of the chapel that he built. As per the wishes of Msgr. J.M.B. D'Souza, in his will, that a priest from his family should be his successor, Fr. Justin D'Souza was lent by the Bishop of Daman to the Archdiocese of Bombay and appointed Chaplain at Orlem. He carried on the good work of Msgr. D'Souza and his brother Fr. Elias who bequeathed all his properties to the church. Fr. Justin built the first school, the St Anne's High School, in 1915. Through his efforts, Orlem was constituted a separate parish, in a decree dated 2 July 1916. Fr. Justin extended the church and was assisted in this effort by Mrs. Mary Magdalene D'Souza who financed the elevation for the choir. Fr. Justin also donated all his lands to the Archdiocese and, the Cardinal Gracias Colony later developed on the land that Fr. Justin had donated for the welfare of Orlem. The parish priests that helped to raise Orlem to its present stature include Fr. Herman Mendes, Fr. Celestine Fonseca, Fr. Walter D’Souza, Msgr. Staney Pereira, Fr. Peter C. Gomes and Fr. Frank Noronha, who ventured to start the construction of the new school building in 1959. In the year 1976, Fr. Octavian Dias worked hard to make possible a new extension to the school, a Parochial House and the new Church. Since the Solemn Inauguration of the new Church on Sunday 6 June 1976, by the then Rt. Rev. Dr, Simon Pimenta, Auxiliary Bishop of Bombay, there has been a huge rise in the Catholic population (highest in the whole world in terms of per parish. Although Orlem now boasts of being a highly developed commercial as well as residential area, it still maintains its original ambiance. It has come a long way from being a simple village to one of the most attractive places in Bombay (Mumbai). The borders of Orlem are not clearly defined nor is it considered to be a matter of debate or concern. Orlem is sometimes considered to be the umbrella of the other smaller villages of Kharodi, Kanchpada, Rathodi etc. Today Kharodi and Rathodi do not belong to the Orlem parish. As there is no known origin of the name Orlem, besides \\"Our Lady Malad\\", a popular nursery rhyme is often attributed to its origin. Location Orlem is situated at the northern part of Mumbai in the western suburb of Malad. It is within the innards of Malad and can only be reached by road. Orlem branches from the main road called Marve Road, which is the main route to Marve beach from Swami Vivekanand Road. Orlem is accessible from the Malad Railway station through the bus routes 243, 270, 271, 272, 273, 281, 622 and 345. Landmarks The Our lady of Lourdes Church , established in 1916, is the kernel spot and landmark for Orlem. It is also known as the Orlem Church. Many major B.E.S.T. bus routes stop at \\"Orlem Church\\" and some routes terminate here. According to a Church census conducted in 2004, it was the largest parish in the Archdiocese of Bombay. The Orlem parish is divided into eight zones. Localities The major zones in Orlem are: * Tank Colony * Joe Braz Colony (J.B.C.) * Lourdes Colony * Baudi * Mithchowki * Evershine Nagar * Somwar Bazar & Liberty Garden * D'monte Lane Orlem is the channel for many Mumbai beaches such as Marve Beach, Aksa Beach, Madh Island, Erangal, and Dhana Pani. Demographics Orlem was traditionally inhabited by the East Indians. According to a 2004 Church census, there were around 7,000 Tamil Catholics in the Orlem parish. With the huge boom of the call centre service industry in the 2000s, Orlem witnessed a large influx of young working class executives. The real estate value of Orlem has increased considerably in past few years. Business Many businesses have grown in and around Orlem. Farm Products and 20th Century Store are some of the oldest stores in the locality. The \\"D'souza Market\\" popularly known as the \\"Orlem Market\\" was started by Mr. Wency D'souza and is the neighborhood grocery store.

It closed in June 2008. Ted Byfield was one of the school's founders. The school provided a strict, traditional education with corporal punishment and an extensive outdoor program that included snowshoeing, hiking, canoeing, ice hockey, lacrosse and other rigorous and challenging activities. Two other 'Saint John's Schools' had already closed. They were Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School in Selkirk, Manitoba (near Winnipeg), and Saint John's School of Ontario (Toronto area).Unofficial school webpage, accessed 12 August 2007. Core philosophical beliefs The school was conservative in social and religious outlook. Following is a listing of the main principles espoused by the school: =Perseverance is a virtue= The ability to go on when you want to lie down and quit is important. Most people can do far more than they ever thought possible. Success in doing the difficult in one area makes it easier to succeed in another. =Courage is a virtue= It is not wrong to be afraid. It is right to face your fears, and do your utmost to overcome them. \\"Without real danger there can be no real adventure. Without real adventure, there can be no real growth.\\" [Ted Byfiled, Men Wanted—Staff Recruiting Manual] =Faith is a virtue= When the world is dark about you, strength comes from your faith in God. Grace is said before every meal. On trips the day starts with Morning Prayer, and finishes with Compline. The religious connections of the school had diminished over the years, to the point that it described itself as non-denominational and staff did not consider themselves as members of a faith or religious community. =Work is honorable= Chores decrease the costs of running the school, making it less expensive for all. They also ensure that no student need fear unemployment. =Strength and learning come through hard work= These were organized in the form of exercise and study. Study is foreign to the wishes of most boys, so the school has supervised study for all boys whose marks are below 75%. =Actions have consequences= There are rules. Flout them, and receive the consequences. Corporal punishment The school's historic use of \\"swat sticks\\" to spank the boys for virtually any infraction (0.4 metre long pieces of wood, similar to a US school paddle) was defended by founder Ted Byfield as being among the positive and character- forming aspects of the schools.Ted Byfield, \\"Do our new-found ideas on children maybe explain the fact we can't control them?\\", Alberta Report, Edmonton, 21 October 1996. Paddlings continued until the 2003 school year (Confirmed). Revised discipline in later years Updated discipline included things like: marks below minimum received supervised study in the dining room instead of the dorm; homework not done for class, free time spent in learning centre with a teacher to help; late for class: Run 1 km; swear in the presence of a teacher, 10-20 pushups; running in the hall, go back and walk; talking after lights out, stand in silence in the hallway for half an hour while dorm mates get to sleep. Bully and get a 5-day suspension; do it again - expelled; bring drugs into the school, suspension and counselling, required attendance at a program to stop using and periodic urine tests thereafter. =Staff were expected to lead by example= Eighty percent of the frontline staff participated in the outdoor program. Many staff had a chore crew to oversee, and they often joined in the task at hand. Controversy about the outdoor program =Ted Milligan, 1976 hypothermia case= The school's outdoor program was news on several occasions. This incident took place at St. John's Cathedral Boys' School in Selkirk, Manitoba and was the basis for an article in the Canadian edition of Reader's Digest \\"Drama in Real Life\\". In 1976, Ted Milligan collapsed with hypothermia two miles from the school while on a voluntary training run for the \\"Interschool Snowshoe Race\\" held annually between the Manitoba and Alberta schools. The day started out warm, but at sunset, the temperature dropped rapidly. Milligan's clothes were soaked with sweat, and he chilled. Initially he was thought dead, with no detectable pulse by the school's nurse. He was unresponsive to resuscitation efforts. At the Selkirk Hospital, doctors heated up the ER and wisely placed an ice pack on his head to prevent thermal shock to his brain. In time, he was revived and was awake and alert the following morning. Ted Milligan's ordeal established medical history as being one of the first deep hypothermia victims brought back. He has no effects of the incident besides memory loss of the incident itself. (Common in hypothermia cases.) As a consequence of this incident, the school instituted a policy of mandatory cold weather hypothermia training for all staff and students to be completed before the start of the winter season every year. The school also required polypro instead of cotton long underwear, required that cotton-based outerwear not be used, and that all personnel would carry their parka with them at all times on snowshoe runs. The school issued a day pack to make carrying the parka easier on warm days. =Markus Janisch, 1970s death= Markus Janisch, collapsed during the Interschool Snowshoe Race, and died at the Alberta school from an undetected (and with the medical technology of the era, undetectable) brain aneurysm. The autopsy report stated that this type of aneurysm would typically have burst before the patient was age 20. =Response to Lake Temiskaming canoeing disaster at St. John's School of Ontario= On a canoe trip from the Ontario School on 11 June 1978, 12 boys and one staff member died on Lake Temiskaming from drowning and hypothermia. At the inquest into the deaths, the coroner determined that the trip could have been better planned but that the school was not negligent. Program changes, post-Temiskaming * Bowsmen must have 10 days' experience as a paddler. * Steersman must have 10 days' experience as a bowsman. * All paddlers must pass a test on cold-water hypothermia every year. * All paddlers must have a minimum of 8 hours' paddling instruction and practice under controlled conditions (protected area, rescue boat nearby) before undertaking an expedition. * All paddlers must participate in two dumping practices before each trip to become familiar with the rescue procedures, both as victims and as rescuers. * All voyageur canoes carried an inflatable life raft. These were rechecked as per manufacturer's recommendation. * The school put in place rules regarding hours travelled, hours rested, hours a driver could drive, and the frequency and spacing of meals leading up to the trip. All of this was to prevent personnel from commencing trips in exhausted states. * All non-trivial rapids are scouted from shore. * Any person if worried about the safety of the rapid can opt out. This includes bowsmen and steersmen. * The brigade leader may decide that a given individual is not qualified to shoot a particular rapid. After Temiskaming there were no dumpings on lakes. In the 1990s the school began retiring its fleet of specially designed \\"Selkirk\\"-style canoes in favour of the Mariner design from Clipper Canoes in Abbotsford, B.C. These canoes were more stable, with greater freeboard and width. Corporal punishment and outdoor program changes Some policies changed over the years: some time before corporal punishment in Canadian schools became illegal in 2004,\\"Supreme Court takes strap out of teachers' hands\\", Edmonton Journal, Alberta, 1 February 2004. the spanking of students with wooden paddles for infractions at St John's was ended. Underlying attitudes and ideology did not change. The school continued to have an outdoor education program with snowshoe training and races (now shortened from the original one-day, 16-hour races of 50 miles (80 km), canoe trips and other outdoor excursions. The school pushed students to their physical and psychological limits; the wilderness excursions emphasized endurance and challenge. The students were required to participate in four core programs: academics, outdoor, work (chores) and sales. The school employed a janitor who came four times a week, but the students did most of the work including, but not limited to, taking care of the sled dogs, building and repairing sleds, harness and traces, cleaning dorms, shovelling walks in winter, yardwork in spring and fall, cleaning the kitchen, dining room, and laundry (using the machines, sorting, and distributing). The school had 60 students from grades 7 to 12 when it closed, down from the 106 boys capacity. Tuition fees as listed on the school's website ranged from about $9,000 for day students to $23,000 for residential students. In 2007–08, 80% of the enrollment was residential. Company of the Cross The school was run by a religious order called the Company of the Cross,Alberta Education listing, accessed 8 September 2007 which was a lay order of the Anglican Church of Canada, but the relationship to the church is presently unclear, having changed over time from the specific church control and sponsorship described in the Company's documentation to informal, i.e., not acknowledged or listed on any official document of the Anglican Diocese of EdmontonAnglican diocese of Edmonton webpage, accessed 7 September 2007 or Anglican Church. The school later labelled itself nondenominational. =Internal documents= (source: Stephen Riley, archives, St. John's Cathedral, Winnipeg), p. 2: From an undated document entitled \\"The student and the Master\\" :\\"The Necessity of Discipline\\" :We are, as Christians, supposed to know the world and be able to cope with it. One of the greatest temptations put forth by the world is to buy its fantasy picture of reality. This fantasy would have us believe that :a) all people are basically good; :b) that we don't have to work to eat; :c) that getting the work finished is more important than how well it is done; :d) that carelessness won't end in tragedy; :e) that children know what is best for them. :Discipline is necessary in every society to keep it functioning because human nature is not basically good.\\" (from the same document, p. 15, comes a warning to the staff that each member must be consistent in applying the policy on discipline. It says there is no room for \\"Mr. Nice Guy.\\"): :\\"1. You know school policy, follow it. :2. If it offends you aesthetically - leave and quit undermining everyone else. :3. If you want to stay, change before you are asked to leave.\\" (from the same document, p. 17): :\\"spanking is permissible in class or study but be aware of two things: :1) If you fear a confrontation, don't try it. :2) Don't humiliate a boy and make him cry in front of the group.\\" Legal problems =Criminal charges= Paul 'Chester' Nordahl, a teacher from St. John's School of Alberta, was charged with one count of assault causing bodily harm in 1990.\\"Boy's school prof. charged in assault\\", Edmonton Journal, 15 February 1990. After the school initiated a letter writing campaign to the Attorney general of Alberta, the Chief Crown prosecutor, the Minister of Social Services, the M.L.A. for Drayton Valley and Mr. Tom Thurber, the charges were eventually stayed. (reference: freedom of information documents) =Child welfare investigations= In January 1990, Alberta Family and Social Services conducted an investigation that was obtained by a freedom of information request. This is a summary of the document that is available in full form in Wikisource. Summary: A boy complained to child welfare authorities that the school's discipline of him with a stick, measuring , had caused bruises. The investigators examined the child, and found bruising consistent with the measurements of the stick. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated because causing bruises in such circumstances is considered infliction of bodily harm. The investigators noted that prior complaints were received before 1983. The investigation noted that six children had run away to avoid the physical punishment of being hit with the sticks, and this was known to the RCMP from previous reports. It was also noted that older children physically assaulted younger children during supervision of chores and other activities. The Wikisource document should be consulted for complete details. The document also contains an initial heavily edited response by the school, also obtained by freedom of information request (the indication of \\"SEC. 17\\" in the document indicates censored information with the freedom of information request). =Lawsuits= The school was sued for $3.5 million in 2003 by Jeffrey Richard Birkin regarding \\"psychological and physical mistreatment\\" on a \\"new boy wilderness trip\\" in 1976. The claim listed direct physical abuse involving being hit by teachers causing physical injuries, and having been subjected to degrading and humiliating treatment.FG Vaughn Marshall websbite, accessed 14 August 2007 The outcome of the lawsuit is not clear, possibly a negotiated and sealed settlement. In a 1990s interview, founder Ted Byfield agreed that some of the treatment of students in past times would be considered excessive and worthy of criminal charges if they occurred today. The school had been previously sued in 1996 by Matt Riddel who lost 9 toes on a 4-day, 50-kilometre snowshoe and dogsled trip during which temperatures dropped to -28 degrees C. The outcome of this lawsuit was a negotiated and sealed settlement in 1999. Kenneth 'Feely' Mealey, a teacher at Saint John's School of Alberta, Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School and Saint John's School of Ontario, was jailed for sexual abuse of students in the 1980s.\\"Guilty plea on sex assault charges\\", CBC News, 12 October 2000. Media portrayals =Ottawa Citizen: \\"Character How a school builds it\\", 5 March 1988= =\\"Boys Adrift\\", book= Leonard Sax's second book, Boys Adrift, mentions Saint John's School implicitly in two separate illustrations. Sax's view of the school seems to be favorable, as its philosophy conforms with his views on single-sex education. =The Old Boys, television documentary= From The Old Boys a television documentary broadcast by CBC Manitoba on 28 February 1990 (produced by Stephen Riley; reporter was Robert Enright) interview subject was Patrick Treacy, who spent four years at the Manitoba school during the 1970s. Treacy was deemed by staff at the time to be one of the best students there. =The New Boys, film= In 1974, the National Film Board of Canada filmed a documentary about sister school, St. John's Cathedral Boys' School. =Weekend Magazine No. 5, 1968= From a story by James Quig p. 6 quoting Frank Wiens, (headmaster and co-founder of St. John's Cathedral Boy's School, Selkirk). School closure and the future On 14 July 2008, the acting head master, Peter Jackson, posted a notice on the school's website that the school is closed for the 2008–2009 year citing a lack of instructors and a lack of students.St John's School of Alberta homepage as of 15 July 2008 The school was permanently closed in December 2008, although some former students and teachers have been discussing a revival which minimizes or severs connections with the old schools and what they see as the tainted St. John's \\"brand-name\\". Saint John's premises now house Mother Earth's Children's Charter School (MECCS), attended by some First Nation, Metis, & Inuit (FNMI) K-09 students from the neighboring communities.

The authority's activities include education, development and conservation. Centered in Saskatoon, the Conservation Zone of Meewasin runs along the river valley from the eastern edge of the municipality of Corman Park through Saskatoon to the western edge of Corman Park (Pike Lake to Clarke’s Crossing). The authority is actively involved in the River Landing redevelopment. It is made up of numerous conservation areas, canoe launches, interpretive centres (Meewasin Valley Centre, Beaver Creek Conservation Area and Saskatoon Natural Grasslands), Yorath Island, the university lands, a skating rink, and over of Meewasin Valley Trail, of which are paved. Governance Peturrson's Ravine Meewasin is governed by a 12 member board with four representatives each from the three participating parties: City of Saskatoon, Province of Saskatchewan, and University of Saskatchewan. The Conservation Zone covers approximately . Meewasin is the means by which the three participating parties (City of Saskatoon, Province of Saskatchewan and University of Saskatchewan) have chosen to manage their lands, through one common authority. Meewasin has statutory authority to control development in the Conservation Zone along the river valley, and does so through public committees. Meewasin's mandates Meewasin has three mandates that focus on conservation, development, and education. * Conservation: Protection of natural and heritage resources in the valley is one of Meewasin's primary goals. The goal of the Resource Conservation Department is to protect, conserve and restore natural habitat that has been changed or altered. Projects include improving biodiversity in natural grasslands through sheep grazing; erosion control and re-vegetation of areas along the river bank; afforestation (greening the valley); working with steward groups to restore important natural sites throughout the valley; preservation of remaining natural areas in the valley, and enhancing, restoring and/or creating wildlife habitat areas. * Development: The Meewasin Valley Trail follows the South Saskatchewan River through Saskatoon. Cross- country skiing takes place during the winter months, along with skating in Kiwanis Memorial Park. Access points are found throughout the city with interpretive signage and washrooms located along the route. In the winter the Meewasin Skating Rink is free to the public; it is located in Kiwanis Memorial Park beside the Delta Bessborough hotel. The rink has been open since 1980. * Education: Meewasin offers a number of education programs that promote conservation of the natural and cultural heritage resources of the valley  Meewasin Valley Centre: The Meewasin Valley Centre is about Saskatoon's history, the South Saskatchewan River, and the future of the Meewasin Valley through interactive displays. The Centre also provides tourist information and a gift shop. The MVC staff delivers a cultural history program to most grade 3 students in Saskatoon. The Centre partnered with other organizations to host such events as the annual Heritage Festival of Saskatoon, National Rivers Day, and Seasonal programs at the historic Marr Residence. The Meewasin Valley Center is located along the riverbank in Friendship Park.  Beaver Creek Conservation Area: Beaver Creek Conservation Area is located 13 km south of Saskatoon. A sheltered creek, river valley, and prairie habitat offer observation of flora and fauna for visitors. The area is a microcosm of the Meewasin Valley and contains one of the few uncultivated short grass prairie sites in Saskatchewan. Public programs are Moon Hikes, Perseid Meteor Showers, and Heritage Hoopla. Meewasin Registered Charity Meewasin is a registered charity. Approximately 54% of its budget for 2006–07 came from non statutory sources to support conservation, development and education initiatives.

In an unrelated development Huzaifa Parhat's DTA appeal concluded that his Combatant Status Review Tribunal had erred in confirming he was an \\"enemy combatant\\", due to insufficient evidence. The Department of Justice had the option of appealing the ruling, claiming it had new evidence. The Uyghurs' habeas petitions were the first to be scheduled for review. In September 2008, days before the Department of Justice would have been expected to offer a justification in court for the Uyghurs' detention, and after six and half years of extrajudicial detention, the Department of Justice acknowledged the evidence to justify their detention did not exist. Temporary Asylum in Palau In June 2009, the government of Palau announced that they would offer temporary asylum to some of the Uyghurs. The government of Palau sent a delegation to Guantanamo, and interviewed some of the remaining Uyghurs. Some of the Uyghurs declined to be interviewed by the Palauns. In the end the government of Palau offered asylum to twelve of the remaining thirteen Uyghurs. Palau declined to offer asylum to one of the Uyghurs who suffered from a mental disorder, brought on by detention, that was too profound to be treated in Palau. On October 31, 2009, Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were released and transferred to Palau. On June 29, 2015, Nathan Vanderklippe, reporting in The Globe and Mail, wrote that all the Uyghurs had quietly left Palau. The Globe confirmed that Palau's agreement to give refuge to the Uyghurs was reached after the USA agreed to various secret payments. Those payments included $93,333 to cover each Uyghurs living expenses. The Globe confirmed that controversy still surrounded former President Johnson Toribiong who had used some of those funds to billet the Uyghurs in houses belonging to his relatives. Vanderklippe reported that the men had never felt they could fit in with the Palauans. Some of the men compared Palau with a lusher, larger Guantanamo. Some of the men were able to bring their wives to Palau. Attempts to hold most regular jobs failed, due to cultural differences. Attempts to use their traditional leather-working skills to be self-employed failed. Eventually, all six men were employed as night-time security guards, a job that did not require interaction with Palauans. Tragically, one of the men's young toddler, conceived and born on Palau, died after he fell off a balcony.

The Saint Kitts and Nevis Scout Oath and Law, as well as other Scouting requirements, closely follow that of the United Kingdom. Scouting was founded on the islands in 1928 by Reverend W.A. Beckett. Although the program activities are taken from the British system, Saint Kitts and Nevis Scouting is geared to the Caribbean way of life. Training for Wood Badge and leader training are conducted with the help of British and nearby Caribbean Scout associations. Saint Kitts and Nevis Scouts participate in numerous Caribbean camps and events. Presently, five Scout groups are in operation on Saint Kitts-the Saint Georges Scout Group, Sandy Point Scout Group, Newton Ground Scout Group, Verchild's Scout Group and the newest Irishtown Primary School Scout Group. Bernadette Dolphin was key for the development of the Scout movement on Saint Kitts. She became the first female Chief Scout Commissioner in Latin America and the Caribbean Region in the late 1990s, and still holds the office to date. Traditionally, Founder's Day is observed with a combination of three events, a march through the streets of Basseterre, church service and luncheon.

She is best known for her efforts in restoring the research of mathematical logic in the Soviet Union and publishing and editing the mathematical works of Karl Marx. Biography Yanovskaya was born in Pruzhany, a town near Brest, to a Jewish family of accountant Alexander Neimark. From 1915 to 1918 she studied in a woman's college in Odessa, when she became a communist. She worked as a party official until 1924, when she started teaching at the Institute of Red Professoriate. With exception of the war years (1941–1943), she worked at Moscow State University until retirement. Engels had noted in his writings that Karl Marx had written some mathematics. Yanonskaya found Marx's Mathematical Manuscripts and she arranged for their first publication in 1933 in Russian. She received her doctoral degree in 1935. Her work on Karl Marx's mathematical manuscripts began in 1930s and may have had some influence on the study of non-standard analysis in China.J.W. Dauben, Marx, Mao and mathematics: the politics of infinitesimals, Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. III (Berlin, 1998), Doc. Math. 1998, Extra Vol. III, 799-809. In the academia she is most remembered now for her work on history and philosophy of mathematics, as well as for her influence on young generation of researchers. She persuaded Ludwig Wittgenstein when he was visiting Soviet Union in 1935 to give up his idea to relocate to the Soviet Union.John Moran, Wittgenstein and Russia, New Left Review May–June 1972. In 1968 Yanovskaya arranged for a better publication of Marx's work. For her work, Yanovskaya received the Order of Lenin and other medals. She died from diabetes in Moscow. Notes References * I.H.

In articles from the NAWR periodical Nylænde, she emphasized women's economic independence as a necessity for their liberation. In spirit of this she was also occupied with education and organizing of women. She was one of the teachers in the \\"free education for women\\", which was initiated by other feminists. She held lectures on women's professional education and stressed that women should be allowed as apprentices in craftsmanship. In Nylænde, she spoke warm-heartedly about a pension fund for housekeepers.

It featured synthesis, user sample playback, sequencer, effects and performance facilities in a 61-key package. Another version, with 76 weighted keys, but otherwise identical features except polyphonic aftertouch, was offered as the TS-12. Main Features The TS series sported 32-note polyphony, integrated 24-bit effects engine, (with 48 bit accumulation) a 30,000 note sequencer (expandable to over 100,000 via memory chips) which featured up to 24 tracks, full MIDI capabilities. The design was a direct evolution of Ensoniq's previous VFX and SD synthesizers. While the synthesis structure lacked a resonant filter, which limited the sample+synthesis possibilities, the TS could read ASR wavesamples directly. This feature allowed musicians to play sounds from a vast library of sample disks and CD- ROMs (via SCSI expansion option). The TS-10 featured polyphonic aftertouch and a good keyboard feeling, which was much liked by pro musicians. In Ensoniq's tradition of ease of use, the front panel offered plenty of buttons for dedicated functions, and a large 40 x 92 vacuum fluorescent display, easier to read onstage than conventional LCD displays. Synthesis structure. The TS offered up to 6 oscillators per patch or sound. Each oscillator was processed by its own pitch, filter and amplifier blocks, with dedicated LFOs and envelope generators for each block. The architecture allowed various modulation sources, such as keyboard velocity, modulation and pitch wheels, etc. to modify several instances of the sonic chain. Despite the well- specified architecture, the filter didn't feature any kind of resonance. This limited the possibilities of emulating analog and heavily-filtered sounds. However, this was a common omission from several manufacturers of the early 1990s. The total 32-note polyphony was reduced when using more than one waveform per patch. The user patches could be stored in one of 120 memories, or saved to floppy disk. Hyperwave. It was an attempt to offer a kind of basic wavesequencing, it essentially was a series of user-defined waveforms, taken from the internal ROM or sample RAM area, and played in sequence with definable playback step times, pitch and other parameters. Clever use of this facility could produce complete rhythmic patterns. One big limitation was the wavesequencing timing, which was fixed at patch level and not tempo-dependent. Effects. An integral component of Ensoniq synths, the TS' effects were first- class and well specified, at 24-bit and 32 kHz engine. The effects block was arranged in several fixed algorithms, which allowed up to three simultaneous effects at once, plus a dry signal path. The effects list was comprehensive, including reverbs, flangers, chorus, compressors, delays. While adequate at single patch level, the effects block had to be shared by all instruments when the sequencer was used, meaning that only selected sounds could ported their effects to the mix. Sequencer. Ensoniq's approach for sequencing was somewhat different from other manufacturers. Instead of offering a linear set of tracks for recording, the TS required the user to record short sequences (12 tracks each) to use as a base for song structure, then chaining them and optionally layering another 12 linear tracks on top of the chained blocks. The sequencer editing options included quantization with audition, controller editing and scaling and MIDI functions per track, as well as copying whole or parts of tracks to anywhere else. The keyboard could store up to 30 songs with 100 sequences per song, memory-permitting, and everything was kept in memory when the synth was turned off. Modern synthesizers, with larger and better sequencers, demand the user to save their work before power down, since the sequencer memory is not backed up. Sample playback. In addition to the machine's internal 6 MB ROM sampled waveforms, the user could install up to 8 MB (divided into two banks of 4 MB) sample RAM (volatile), via 30-pin SIMMs. The samples could be loaded from the floppy disk drive, or via a SCSI hard drive or CD-ROM attached to the machine, containing an ASR-format disk. The synth even remembered the mapping of samples and sounds used, and requested the appropriate disks for loading in power-up. The TS couldn't import WAV or AIFF format samples as the disk format used was Ensoniq's own, first developed for the EPS sampler, and it wasn't MS-DOS compatible, so the user was limited to loading samples available in the extensive EPS/ASR library. Performance features. The TS offered the ubiquitous pair of modulation and pitch wheels, polyphonic aftertouch, and 'patch select' buttons for easily changing tonal variants of a patch. It was very easy to layer up to three single sounds, or split the keyboard in all zones for internal or MIDI playing control, without cumbersome menu editing. It was also possible to layer up to six single sounds by taking advantage of the live-auditioning feature of the sequencer (without actually recording or playing back anything), but this was less easy to manage in a performance environment. In Use The TS suffered from limitations including the non-resonant digital filter, or the proprietary format used for floppies, which was incompatible with anything else. This prevented Standard MIDI Files to be read by the machine, and the strange track arrangement of the sequencer limited the MIDI multitimbral parts of the TS to 12 instead of the standard 16. The vacuum fluorescent display, although unique and very easy to read, was prone to malfunction after much time of use and very hard to replace or repair. Even Ensoniq acknowledged this problem by creating a variant called the TS-10 Plus, which used a conventional LCD display instead of the vacuum one. This model also had the SCSI expansion installed and the full sample memory expansion also installed. The TS series were well received by musicians and producers, mainly because of the rich, professional sound they offered, the enormous ASR sample library that it could load, and the live performance features that offered.

He was born in the small settlement of Županići, in the region of Labin, Istria, and schooled in Pazin and Koper. He continued his studies in Vienna, later resettling in Trieste before coming back to Istria, where he was to build his best known invention, the speedometer. After completing his studies, Belušić was employed as a professor of physics and mathematics at the Royal Teacher's School in Koper. Later, he became director of the Maritime School in Castelnuovo, and received the title of assistant professor in that institution. In 1887 Belušić publicly experimented for the first time with his new invention, an electric speedometer.Božo Milanović: Hrvatski narodni preporod u Istri, 1967, page 406 The invention was patented in Austria-Hungary under the name of \\"velocimeter.\\" Belušić exhibited his invention at the 1889 Exposition Universell in Paris, and renamed it Controllore automatico per vetture. In the same year, the Municipality of Paris created a tender wherein over 120 patents were registered to compete. His design won as the most precise and reliable and was accepted in June 1890. Within a year, a hundred devices were installed on Parisian carriages. In 1889, the Croatian newspaper Naša sloga predicted that \\"[Belušić's invention] will spread all over the world, and with it the name of our virtuous Istrian, friend and patriot.\\" Birth date, death date and nationality Belušić was born on March 12, 1847 in the little village of Županići, on the outskirts of Labin, Istria, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia). Županići is closer to Sveta Nedelja than Labin, and in fact today it is part of the former's municipality. There is some debate surrounding Belušić's place of death, with the Croatian Technical Encyclopedia pointing to Trieste. He died on January 8, 1905. Belušić was 57 years old at the time of his death. He was an ethnic Croat born in Austria-Hungary. Early life and education Little is known about Belušić's early life. He was born to Marin Belušić and Katarina Ružić. Belušić spent his childhood in Županići, and was educated in nearby Pazin (5 miles northeast of Županići) and Koper (today Slovenia). In Pazin, the school's priests who tended to him were the first to notice his talent for the natural sciences. Belušić later enrolled in the Higher State Gymnasium in Koper. Koper ca. 1900 The Koper high school had 8 classes. The official languages of the institution were Italian and German. In the upper grades, there were also elective courses in the Slavic and Illyrian languages. As a state grammar school, the institution was loyal to the Monarchy and the emperor. According to its curriculum, religious education, Italian, German, Latin and mathematics were studied in all eight grades. The elective courses included Slavic language, drawing and poetry, and starting from 1901 physical education. Slavonic as an elective course was introduced in the school programme in 1867. In the school year 1865/66, Belušić terminated the 6th grade. In that year, 161 students attended the grammar school, of which 149 were Italians and 12 were Slavs. According to the official census and the directory from that year, Josip Belušić was especially praised in the 6th grade, and his own class finished with the best results in the class rank. Trieste, 19th century During his high school education, Belušić also earned himself a scholarship. He received 100 forints from the Province and 40 forints from the provincial governorship. His conduct, grades and attendance were assessed as impeccable throughout his higher education. His courses were Latin, Greek, Italian and German, geography and history, mathematics, physics. As elective courses he chose Slavic language and philosophy. In 1875, after finishing his studies, he was employed as a professor of physics and mathematics at the Imperial and Teacher's School in Koper, where he taught to the school's male students. Belušić taught in German, Italian and Illyrian. According to a 1900 report of the Imperial and Royal Academy in Koper, Professor Belušić passed the professional exam for obtaining the title of professor in Trieste. He became then the director of the Maritime School in Castelnuovo, near Trieste, and received the title of assistant professor in that institution. In all documentary record, it is always stated that \\"Josip Belušić from St. Martin near Labin,\\" was a Croatian and a Catholic. The same documents also show that in 1875, when he was employed at the Academy, he was a bachelor. Belušić later did marry. However, no further information about his family has been uncovered. It remains unclear where and how he died. Velocimeter Copy of the velocimeter patent, 1888, Police Museum, Zagreb On February 7, 1889, the Croatian newspaper Naša sloga wrote about a new invention by Professor Belušić, which he protected under the bodies of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Foretelling a bright future, Belušić reportedly stated: > It is a small apparatus that, as a faithful servant, controls every move > which the coachman makes with the horses and the carriage entrusted to him. > Through electricity, this machine records exactly whether the carriage is > standing or moving and how fast it is moving; when the carriage began to > move, and when it stopped. In addition, it records whether the carriage was > empty or whether there was a person in it; further, it states how many > people were aboard, at what time each person entered the carriage or got out > of it; thence, how many minutes each person rode in the carriage. Copy of patent application for rental vehicle monitoring device, 1888, Police Museum, Zagreb The official presentation of Belušić's invention to the public, and the first public experiment occurred in 1887. A second experiment in late February 1889 was attended by four journalists who actively participated in the experiment on the route Trieste - Sveti Bartol. During the experiment, the carriage stopped several times; the journalists got out of the carriage and entered it again. On the way back to Trieste, they looked at what the velocimeter had registered. The journalists were delighted with the accuracy of the device, which recorded all the actions taken by the carriage on round- format paper. The velocimeter electronically measured the speed of the vehicle, the duration of the ride, and the standing of the car; the number of carried individuals, and the passengers' time of entry and exit. Thus, Belušić's device was also a tachograph and a taximeter, a forerunner of measuring monitoring devices used today in trucks, buses and taxicabs. Belušić applied for his patent in 1888, under the name Controllore automatico per vetture, with the State Patent Office in Vienna, because the device had other possibilities besides measuring speed. As mentioned, his device worked on electricity, measured the speed of the vehicle, the duration of driving and standing of the vehicle, the number of transported people and the passengers' time of entry and exit. The original patent is kept in the State Archives in Vienna today. A copy of the patent is also housed at the Police Museum in Zagreb, It is not known how Belušić's invention wound up. The inventor had probably to invest more money to perfect his invention and then put it on the market. Belušić did not benefit of much funding, so his work fell into oblivion. Data from the State Archives in Trieste testify to the founding of a company with the aim of presenting Belušić's invention in Paris, as well as Belušić's financial trouble and problems with his business partner. In the U.S. Patent Office's archives there is a copy of the original patent, a patent application dated December 16, 1890, and a report of the Patent Commission showing that in 1890 fifty-six foreign inventors were included in the office's database. Among those registered, under the patent application number 442849, there is Professor Belušić. Belušić's witnesses for his patent were Edmund J. Ussen and Otto Schiffer. Exposition Universelle of 1889 Postcard of trams stopping at the Galerie des Machines, at the edge of the Exposition Belušić exhibited his velocimeter at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in the Paris. The Exposition drew 28 million visitors and over 68 thousand exhibitors, including many of the world's noted inventors and artists of the day. Although the main attractions of the exposition were the premiere of the Eiffel Tower and the opening of the colossal pavilion built for the exibition, the Galerie des machines, by far the largest vaulted building to have yet been built, Belušić's velocimeter also drew attention. Belušić was awarded a diploma and gold medal by the French Academy of Inventors, which also named him as an honorary member. At the same time, the city council of Paris announced a public tender for measuring the service of transport by city carriages. The council was determined to put an end to the constant doubts about the honesty of the coachmen. 129 inventors applied for the competition, and three applicants were shortlisted, including Belušić. Practical experiments were scheduled in December 1889, and in the end, Belušić's device was chosen because, in addition to measuring speed, it accurately reported the departure time of the carriage, how many times and for how long the carriage stopped. Later life It remains unclear how Belušić's invention wound up. As mentioned, the inventor probably had to invest more money to perfect his invention, and later put it on the market. Little is known about Belušić's later life. He had become a professor of physics and mathematics at the teacher's school of Koper, where he worked until 1900, and later the director of a maritime school in Italy. It remains unclear, however, where he spent his last years. Some speculate that the Croatian inventor sold his patent rights due to poverty. The Croatian Technical Encyclopedia reports that he died in Trieste. References Bibliography  Ageorges, Sylvain (2006), Sur les traces des Expositions Universelles (in French), Parigramme.

The same first-order language with = and \\\\in of classical set theory is usually used, so this is not to be confused with a constructive types approach. On the other hand, some constructive theories are indeed motivated by their interpretability in type theories. Apart from rejecting the law of excluded middle ({\\\\mathrm {LEM}}), constructive set theories often require some logical quantifiers in the axioms to be bounded, motivated by results tied to impredicativity.  Overview  The logic of the theories discussed here is constructive in that it rejects {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}, i.e. that the disjunction \\\\phi \\\\lor eg \\\\phi automatically holds for all propositions. This requires rejection of strong choice principles and the rewording of some standard axioms. For example, the Axiom of Choice implies {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} for the formulas in ones adopted Separation schema, by Diaconescu's theorem. Similar results hold for the Axiom of Regularity in its standard form. In turn, constructive theories often do not allow for proofs of properties that are provably computationally undecidable and also generally do not prove the existence of relations that cannot be realized. This then also affects the provability of statements about total orders such as that of all ordinal numbers, expressed by truth and negation of the terms in the order defining disjunction (\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\beta) \\\\lor (\\\\alpha = \\\\beta) \\\\lor (\\\\beta \\\\in \\\\alpha) . This in turn affects the proof theoretic strength defined in ordinal analysis. That said, theories without {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} tend to prove classically equivalent reformulations of classical theorems. For example, in Constructive analysis one cannot prove the intermediate value theorem in its textbook formulation, but one can prove theorems with algorithmic content that, as soon as {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} is assumed, are at once classically equivalent to the classical statement. The difference is that the constructive proofs are harder to find. The subject of constructive set theory begun by John Myhill's work on the {\\\\mathsf {CST}} set theory, a theory of several sorts and bounded quantification, aiming to provide a formal foundation for Errett Bishop's program of constructive mathematics. Below we list a sequence of theories in the same language as {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}, leading up to Peter Aczel's well studied constructive Zermelo- Fraenkel,Peter Aczel and Michael Rathjen, Notes on Constructive Set Theory, Reports Institut Mittag-Leffler, Mathematical Logic - 2000/2001, No. 40 {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} and beyond. {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} is also characterized by the two features present also in Myhill's theory: On the one hand, it is using the Predicative Separation instead of the full, unbounded Separation schema. Boundedness can be handled as a syntactic property or, alternatively, the theories can be conservatively extended with a higher boundedness predicate and its axioms. Secondly, the impredicative Powerset axiom is discarded, generally in favor of related but weaker axioms. The strong form is very casually used in classical general topology. Constructive theories also come with stricter requirements for what sets constitutes a function. Adding {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} to a theory even weaker than {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} recovers {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}, as detailed below. The system, which has come to be known as Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, {\\\\mathsf {IZF}}, is a strong set theory without {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}. It is similar to {\\\\mathsf {CZF}}, but less conservative or predicative. The theory denoted {\\\\mathsf {IKP}} is the constructive version of {\\\\mathsf {KP}}, the classical Kripke–Platek set theory where even the Axiom of Collection is bounded. Many theories studied in constructive set theory are mere restrictions, with respect to their axiom as well as their underlying logic, of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ({\\\\mathsf {ZF}}). Such theories can then also be interpreted in any model of {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}. As far as constructive realizations go there is a realizability theory and Aczel's {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} has been interpreted in a Martin Löf type theories, as described below. In this way, set theory theorems provable in {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} and weaker theories are candidates for a computer realization. More recently, presheaf models for constructive set theories have been introduced. These are analogous to unpublished Presheaf models for intuitionistic set theory developed by Dana Scott in the 1980s.Scott, D. S. (1985). Category-theoretic models for Intuitionistic Set Theory. Manuscript slides of a talk given at Carnegie-Mellon University  Subtheories of ZF  = Class notation = As is common in the study of set theory, one makes use set builder notation for classes, which, in most contexts, are not part of the object language but used for concise discussion. In particular, for a predicate P, one may introduce notation declarations of the corresponding class A=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid P(x)\\\\\\\\}, for the purpose of expressing P(a) as a\\\\in A. One also writes \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in B\\\\mid P(x)\\\\\\\\} as shorthand for \\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid x\\\\in B\\\\land P(x)\\\\\\\\}. Note that for a given predicate Q, in a constructive context, the elements of a subclass A=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in B\\\\mid Q(x)\\\\lor eg Q(x)\\\\\\\\} of B may come equipped with more information than those of B. As Q may be not decidable for all elements in B, the two classes must be distinguished. Below we use the greek \\\\phi as a predicate variable in axiom schemas. = Common axioms = We start with {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} axioms that are virtually always deemed uncontroversial and part of all theories considered in this article. Denote by A\\\\simeq B the statement expressing that two classes have exactly the same elements, i.e. \\\\forall z. (z\\\\in A \\\\iff z\\\\in B). The following axiom gives a means to prove equality \\"=\\" of two sets, so that through substitution, any predicate about x translates to one of x. { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Extensionality ; \\\\forall x. \\\\forall y.\\\\ \\\\ x\\\\simeq y \\\\implies x = y } The converse then holds automatically. Modern type theories may instead aim at defining the demanded equivalence \\"\\\\simeq\\" in terms of functions, see e.g. type equivalence. Other frameworks for constructive mathematics might instead demand a particular rule for equality or apartness come with each and every set. { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Pairing ; \\\\forall x. \\\\forall y.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists p. \\\\forall z. \\\\big((z = x \\\\lor z = y)\\\\implies z\\\\in p\\\\big) } and { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Union ; \\\\forall x.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists u. \\\\forall y. \\\\big((\\\\exists z. y\\\\in z\\\\land z\\\\in x)\\\\implies y\\\\in u\\\\big) } The two axioms may also be formulated stronger in terms of \\"\\\\iff\\", e.g. in the context of {\\\\mathsf {BCST}} this is not necessary. Together they imply the existence of the binary union of two classes a and b when they have been established to be sets, and this is denoted \\\\bigcup\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} or a\\\\cup b. Define class notation for finite elements via disjunctions (e.g. x\\\\in\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} says (x=a)\\\\lor(x=b)) and define the successor set Sx as x\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\}. A sort of blend between pairing and union, an axiom more readily related to the successor is the Axiom of adjunction. It is relevant for the standard modeling of individual Neumann ordinals. This axiom would also readily be accepted, but is not relevant in the context of stronger axioms below. Denote by \\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle the standard ordered pair model \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\},\\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}. = BCST = In the following we will make use of axiom schemas, i.e. we postulate axioms for some collection of predicates. Note that some of the stated axiom schemas are often presented with set parameters v as well, i.e. variants with extra universal closures \\\\forall v such that the \\\\phi's may depend on the parameters. Basic constructive set theory {\\\\mathsf {BCST}} consists of several axioms also part of standard set theory, except the Separation axiom is weakened. Beyond the three axioms above, it adopts the { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of predicative separation: For any bounded predicate \\\\phi with y not free in it, ; \\\\forall y.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists s. \\\\forall x. \\\\Big(x\\\\in s \\\\iff \\\\big(x\\\\in y \\\\land \\\\phi(x)\\\\big)\\\\Big) } also called Bounded Separation, i.e. the Separation for bounded quantifiers only. This amounts to postulating the existence of a set s obtained by the intersection of any set y and any predicatively described class P. Due to the potential undecidability of general predicates, the notion of subset is far more elaborate in constructive set theories than in classical ones, as we will see. When the predicate is taken as x\\\\in z, one obtains the binary intersection of sets, written s=y\\\\cap z. From Separation and the existence of any set (e.g. Infinity below) and the predicate that is false of any set will follow the existence of the empty set, denoted \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\} or by 0. By virtue of the purely logical theorem \\\\forall x. \\\\big(xRs \\\\Leftrightarrow (xRy \\\\land eg xRx)\\\\big) \\\\implies eg sRy, Russel's construction shows that Predicative Separation alone implies that \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in y\\\\mid x otin x\\\\\\\\} otin y. In particular, no universal set exists. { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of Replacement: For any predicate \\\\phi, ; \\\\forall d.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\forall (x\\\\in d). \\\\exists! y. \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\implies \\\\exists r. \\\\forall y. \\\\big(y\\\\in r \\\\iff \\\\exists (x\\\\in d). \\\\phi(x,y)\\\\big) } where \\\\exists! denotes unique existence. It is granting existence, as sets, of range of function-like predicates, obtained via their domains. With the Replacement schema, this theory proves that the equivalence classes or indexed sums are sets. In particular, the Cartesian product, holding all pairs of elements of two sets, is a set. Replacement and the axiom of Set Induction (introduced below) suffices to axiomize hereditarily finite sets constructively and that theory is also studied without Infinity. For comparison, consider the very weak classical theory called General set theory that interprets the class of natural numbers and their arithmetic via just Extensionality, Adjunction and full Separation. Only when assuming {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} does Replacement already imply full Separation. In {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}, the Replacement is mostly important to prove the existence of sets of high rank, namely via instances of the axiom schema \\\\phi(x,y) where relates relatively small set x to bigger ones, y. Constructive set theories commonly have Axiom schema of Replacement, sometimes restricted to bounded formulas. However, when other axioms are dropped, this schema is actually often strengthened - not beyond {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}, but instead merely to gain back some provability strength. Within this conservative context of {\\\\mathsf {BCST}}, the Bounded Separation schema is actually equivalent to Empty Set plus the existence of the binary intersection for any two sets. The latter variant of axiomatization does not make use of a schema. = ECST = Denote by \\\\mathrm{Ind}(A) the Inductive property, e.g. 0\\\\in A\\\\land\\\\forall (n\\\\in A). Sn \\\\in A. In terms of a predicate P underling the class, this would be translated as P(0) \\\\land \\\\forall n. \\\\big(P(n)\\\\implies P(Sn)\\\\big). Note that n denotes a generic set variable here. Write \\\\bigcap A for \\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid\\\\forall y.(y\\\\in A \\\\implies x\\\\in y)\\\\\\\\}. Define a class \\\\omega=\\\\bigcap\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid \\\\mathrm{Ind}(x)\\\\\\\\}. As is usual, express the subclass claim \\\\forall x. x\\\\in A\\\\implies x\\\\in B by A\\\\subset B. For some fixed predicate P, the statement P(a)\\\\land \\\\forall x. P(x)\\\\implies a\\\\subset x expresses that a is the smallest set among all sets x for which P(x) holds true. The elementary constructive Set Theory {\\\\mathsf {ECST}} has the axiom of {\\\\mathsf {BCST}} as well as { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Strong Infinity ; \\\\exists w. \\\\Big( \\\\mathrm{Ind}(w)\\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\big(\\\\forall x. \\\\mathrm{Ind}(x)\\\\implies w\\\\subset x\\\\big) \\\\Big) } The second universally quantified conjunct expresses mathematical induction for all x in the universe of discourse, i.e. for sets. In this way, the principles discussed in this section give means of proving that some predicates hold at least for all elements of \\\\omega. Be aware that even the relatively strong axiom of full mathematical induction (induction for any predicate, discussed below) may also be adopted and used without ever postulating that \\\\omega forms a set. Weak forms of axioms of infinity can be formulated, all postulating that some set with the common natural number properties exist. Then full Separation may be used to obtain the \\"sparse\\" such set, the set of natural numbers. In the context of otherwise weaker axiom systems, an axiom of infinity should be strengthened so as to imply existence of such a sparse set on its own. One weaker form of Infinity reads :\\\\exists w. \\\\forall m. \\\\Big( m \\\\in w \\\\iff \\\\big(m=0 \\\\lor (\\\\exists n \\\\in w). \\\\forall k. (k \\\\in m \\\\iff k \\\\in n \\\\lor k = n) \\\\big) \\\\Big) which can also be written more concisely using S. The set thus postulated to exist is generally denoted by \\\\omega, the smallest infinite von Neumann ordinal. For elements n,m of this set, the claim n=m is decidable. With this, {\\\\mathsf {ECST}} proves induction for all predicates given by bounded formulas. The two of the five Peano axioms regarding 0 and one regarding closedness of S with respect to \\\\omega follow fairly directly from the axioms of infinity. Finally, S can be proven to be an injective operation.  Functions  We may speak of a total functional relation f\\\\subset A\\\\times C when :\\\\forall (a\\\\in A). \\\\exists! (c\\\\in C). \\\\langle a, c\\\\rangle \\\\in f , which notably involves a existential quantifier. (Variants of the functional predicate definition using apartness relations on setoids have been defined as well.) Using the standard class terminology, one can always make use of functions, given their domain is a set. They will be sets if their codomain is, see also Replacement. Let C^A (also written {}^AC) denote the class of such set functions. Write 1 for S0. Given any A\\\\subset B, we are now led to reason about classes such as :\\\\\\\\{\\\\langle x, y\\\\rangle \\\\in B\\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} \\\\mid (x\\\\in A\\\\land y=1) \\\\lor ( eg(x\\\\in A)\\\\land y=0) \\\\\\\\} but be aware that x\\\\in A may not be decidable.  Choice  To be finite means there is a bijective function to a natural. To be subfinite means to be a subset of a finite set. The claim that being a finite set is equivalent to being subfinite is equivalent to {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}. If g\\\\colon\\\\omega\\\\to z, we can form the one-to-many relation-set \\\\\\\\{\\\\langle n, u\\\\rangle\\\\mid n\\\\in\\\\omega\\\\land u\\\\in g(n)\\\\\\\\}. The Axiom of countable choice would grant that whenever \\\\forall (n\\\\in\\\\omega). \\\\exists u. u\\\\in g(n), we can form a function mapping each number to a unique value. Countable choice is implied by the more general Axiom of dependent choice. This is in turn implied by the Axiom of choice concerning functions on general domains. Observe that with the subfinite sets :x=\\\\\\\\{u\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\mid u=0\\\\lor(u=1\\\\land\\\\phi)\\\\\\\\} :y=\\\\\\\\{u\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\mid u=1\\\\lor(u=0\\\\land\\\\phi)\\\\\\\\}, we have \\\\phi\\\\implies(x=y). In this way, Separation ties set equality to predicates. This immediately makes the existence claim of general choice functions f(A)\\\\in A into an image with decidable equality f(x)=f(y) non-constructive. We know that at least 0\\\\in x and 1\\\\in y, irregardless of \\\\phi. But - to motivate the strength of choice - note that when considering the unique functional assignment f(x)=0, we find that should x=y, then unconditionally declaring or deriving that f(y)=1 would not be consistent. Indeed, the full Axiom of Choice, granting existence of a map f\\\\colon\\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\}\\\\to\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} into distinguishable elements, implies \\\\phi\\\\lor eg\\\\phi. Of course, here too little is known about the domain \\\\\\\\{x,y\\\\\\\\}, as opposed to the discrete domain of natural numbers.  Arithmetic  {\\\\mathsf {ECST}} still lacks in capability of dealing with basic functions. However, also here, many statement can be proven per individual set (as opposed to expressions involving a universal quantifier, as e.g. available with an induction axiom) and objects of mathematical interest can be made use of at the class level on an individual bases. As such, the axioms listed so far suffice as a working theory for a good portion of basic mathematics. However, the theory still does not interpret full primitive recursion. Indeed, despite having the Replacement axiom, the theory still does not proof the addition to be a set function. To this end, the axiom granting definition of set functions via iteration-step set functions must be added. We would like for a theory to interpret Peano arithmetic or, more precisely, Heyting arithmetic HA, i.e. the four rules regarding addition and multiplication. What is necessary for this is an iteration principle that is the set theoretical equivalent of a natural numbers object. This principle is implied by assuming that the class of functions :y^{\\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}} on finite domains into sets y form set themselves. This, in turn, is a special case of the Exponentiation axiom below. The use of those axioms derives from the fact that function spaces being sets means quantification over their functions is a bounded notion, enabling use of Separation. However, the induction principle obtained this way do not prove full mathematical induction for all predicates. Nevertheless, with this bounded arithmetic given on \\\\omega, arithmetic of rational numbers {\\\\mathbb Q} can then also be defined and its properties, like uniqueness and countability, be proven. As in the classical theory, Dedekind cuts can be characterized as subsets of algebraic structures such as {\\\\mathbb Q}: The properties of being are inhabited, numerically bounded above, \\"closed downwards\\" and \\"open upwards\\" are all bounded formulas w.r.t the given set underlying the algebraic structure. However, without {{\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb Q}} being a set, neither is the class of all subsets r\\\\subset {\\\\mathbb Q} fulfilling these properties. Similarly, many of the nice properties of the classical theory of reals cannot be proven in the framework postulated so far. = Exponentiation = We already considered a weakened form of the Separation schema, and two more of the standard {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} axioms shall be weakened for a more predicative and constructive theory, namely Powerset and below also Regularity. The characterization of the class {\\\\mathcal P}x of all subsets of a set x involves unbounded universal quantification, namely \\\\forall u. u\\\\subset x\\\\iff u\\\\in {\\\\mathcal P}x. Here \\\\subset has been defined in terms of the membership predicate \\\\in above. So in such a set theoretical framework, the power class is defined not in a bottom-up construction from its constituents (like an algorithm on a list, e.g. \\\\langle a,b\\\\rangle \\\\mapsto \\\\langle \\\\langle \\\\rangle ,\\\\langle a\\\\rangle ,\\\\langle b\\\\rangle ,\\\\langle a,b\\\\rangle \\\\rangle ) but via a comprehension over all sets. For any formula \\\\phi, the class \\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid (x=0) \\\\land \\\\phi\\\\\\\\} equals 0 when \\\\phi can be rejected and 1 when \\\\phi can be proven, but \\\\phi may also not be decidable at all. In this view, the powerset class of the singleton \\\\Omega := {\\\\mathcal P}1, informally \\\\\\\\{0,\\\\dots,1\\\\\\\\}, is called the truth value algebra. The \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}-valued functions on a set x inject into \\\\Omega^x and thus correspond to its decidable subsets. With this, we consider the axiom {\\\\mathrm {Exp}}: { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Exponentiation ; \\\\forall x. \\\\forall y.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists h. h=y^x } In words, the axioms says that given two sets x, y, the class y^x of all functions is, in fact, also a set. In {\\\\mathsf {ECST}}+{\\\\mathrm {Exp}}, one can reason about shrinking interval sequences in ({\\\\mathbb Q}^2)^{\\\\mathbb N} and this also enables speaking of Cauchy sequences and their arithmetic. However more axioms are required to always grant completeness of equivalence classes of such sequences and strong principles need to be postulated to imples the existence of a modulus of convergence for all sequences. Weak countable choice is generally the context for proving uniqueness of the Cauchy reals as complete (pseudo-)ordered field (the reformulation of complete ordered field not presuming decidability of the ordering). In comparison, Dedekind cuts will more eagerly come with completeness properties, but the class of these can still not be shown to form a set with just function spaces. In either case, stronger subset axioms are required for completeness. Assuming all formulas are decidable, i.e. assuming {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}, one can show not only that \\\\Omega is a set, but more concretely that it is this two-element set. Assuming {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} for bounded formulas, Separation lets one demonstrate that any powerclass is a set. Alternatively, full Powerset is also implied by merely assuming that the class of all subsets of 1 forms a set. When functions are understood as just function graphs as above, the membership proposition f\\\\in C^A is also written f\\\\colon A\\\\to C. In type theory, the expression \\"A\\\\to C\\" exists on its own and denotes function spaces, a primitive notion. Thus, in that context, functions are more readily studied than classes of subsets. As with exponential objects resp. subobjects in category theory. These sets naturally appear, for example, as the type of the currying bijection between (z\\\\times x)\\\\to y and z\\\\to y^x, an adjunction. Constructive set theories are also studied in the context of applicative axioms. In category theoretical terms, the {\\\\mathsf {BCST}}+{\\\\mathrm {Exp}} essentially corresponds to a constructively well-pointed Cartesian closed Heyting pretoposes with (whenever Infinity is adopted) a natural numbers object. Existence of powerset is what would turn a Heyting pretopos into an elementary topos. Every such topos that interprets {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} is of course a model of these weaker theories, but locally cartesian closed pretoposes have been defined that e.g. interpret {\\\\mathsf {CZFE}} but reject full Separation and Powerset. Exponentiation does not imply full mathematical induction. = Induction =  Mathematical Induction  The iteration principle for set functions mentioned before is also implied by full induction over ones structure modeling the naturals (e.g. \\\\omega). Induction reads \\\\mathrm{Ind}(A)\\\\implies \\\\omega\\\\subset A for any class. It is often formulated directly in terms of predicates. { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Full mathematical induction: For any predicate \\\\phi on \\\\omega, ; \\\\Big(\\\\phi(0)\\\\ \\\\land\\\\ \\\\forall (n\\\\in \\\\omega). \\\\big(\\\\phi(n)\\\\implies \\\\phi(Sn)\\\\big)\\\\Big)\\\\implies \\\\forall (n\\\\in \\\\omega). \\\\phi(n) } The axiom relates to Separation schemas insofar as it leads to a conclusion about the class \\\\\\\\{n\\\\in\\\\omega\\\\mid\\\\phi(n)\\\\\\\\}. Induction principles are also implied by various forms of choice principles. Roughly, formulations of the Axiom of dependent choice in terms of binary predicates on some level of the hierarchy (one may again only consider bounded formulas) can be used to prove mathematical induction for predicates on that level. Note that in the program of Predicative Arithmetic, even the mathematical induction schema has been criticized as possibly being impredicative, when natural numbers are defined as the object which fulfill this schema.  Set Induction  Naturally, full Set Induction also proves full mathematical induction over the natural numbers. Indeed, it gives induction on ordinals and ordinal arithmetic. Replacement is not required to prove induction over the set of naturals, but it is for their arithmetic modeled within the set theory. The Axiom reads as follows { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of Set induction: For any predicate \\\\phi, ; \\\\Big(\\\\forall y. \\\\forall (x \\\\in y). \\\\big(\\\\phi(x) \\\\implies \\\\phi(y)\\\\big)\\\\Big) \\\\implies \\\\forall z. \\\\phi(z) } The variant just for bounded formulas is also studied independently and may be derived from other axioms. The Axiom of Regularity together with (bounded) Separation implies Set Induction but also (bounded) {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}, so Regularity is non- constructive. Conversely, {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} together with Set Induction implies Regularity. Note that \\\\forall (x\\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\}). P(x) holds trivially and corresponds to the \\"bottom case\\" in the standard framework. Metalogic This now covers variants of all of the eight Zermeolo-Freankel axioms. Extensionality, Pairing, Union and Replacement are indeed identical. Infinity is stated in a strong formulation. Separation, classically stated redundantly, is constructively not implied by Replacement. Without the Law of Excluded Middle, the theory here is lacking full Separation, Powerset as well as Regularity in its common form. The theory {\\\\mathsf {ECST}}+{\\\\mathrm {Exp}} is not stronger than Heyting arithmetic but adding {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} at this stage would lead to a theory beyond the strength of typical type theory: Assuming Separation in unrestricted form, then adding {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} to {\\\\mathsf {ECST}}+{\\\\mathrm {Exp}} gives a theory proving the same theorems as {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} minus Regularity! Thus, adding {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} to that framework gives {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} and adding Choice to it gives {\\\\mathsf {ZFC}}. The added proof- theoretical strength attained with induction in the constructive context is significant, even if dropping Regularity in the context of {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} does not reduce the proof-theoretical strength. Note that Aczel was also one of the main developers or Non-well-founded set theory, which rejects this last axiom. = Strong Collection = With all the weakened axioms of {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} and now going beyond those axioms also seen in Myhill's typed approach, the theory called {\\\\mathsf {CZFE}} (a theory with Exponentiation) strengthens the collection schema as follows: { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of Strong Collection: For any predicate \\\\phi, ; \\\\forall a.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\Big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists y. \\\\phi(x,y)\\\\Big) \\\\implies \\\\exists b. \\\\Big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists (y \\\\in b). \\\\phi(x,y)\\\\ \\\\land\\\\ \\\\forall (y \\\\in b). \\\\exists (x \\\\in a). \\\\phi(x,y)\\\\Big) } It states that if \\\\phi is a relation between sets which is total over a certain domain set a (that is, it has at least one image value for every element in the domain), then there exists a set b which contains at least one image under \\\\phi of every element of the domain. And this formulation then moreover states that only such images of elements of the domain. The last clause makes the axiom - in this constructive context - stronger than the standard formulation of Collection. It is guaranteeing that b does not overshoot the codomain of \\\\phi and thus the axiom is expressing some power of a Separation procedure. The axiom is an alternative to the Replacement schema and indeed supersedes it, due to not requiring the binary relation definition to be functional. As a rule, questions of moderate cardinality are more subtle in a constructive setting. As arithmetic is well available in {\\\\mathsf {CZFE}}, the theory has dependent products, proves that the class of all subsets of natural numbers cannot be subcountable and also proves that countable unions of function spaces of countable sets remain countable. Metalogic This theory without {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}, unbounded separation and \\"naive\\" Power set enjoys various nice properties. For example, it has the Existence Property: If, for any property \\\\Phi, the theory proves that a set exist that has that property, i.e. if the theory proves the statement \\\\exists x.\\\\Phi(x), then there is also a property \\\\Psi that uniquely describes such a set instance. I.e., the theory then also proves \\\\exists !x. \\\\Psi(x)\\\\land\\\\Phi(x). This can be compared to Heyting arithmetic where theorems are realized by concrete natural numbers and have these properties. In set theory, the role is played by defined sets. For contrast, recall that in {\\\\mathsf {ZFC}}, the Axiom of Choice implies the Well-ordering theorem, so that total orderings with least element for sets like \\\\mathbb R are formally proven to exist, even if provably no such ordering can be described. = Constructive Zermelo–Fraenkel = One may approach Power set further without losing a type theoretical interpretation. The theory known as {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} is {\\\\mathsf {CZFE}} plus a stronger form of Exponentiation. It is by adopting the following alternative, which can again be seen as a constructive version of the Power set axiom: { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of Subset Collection: For any predicate \\\\phi, ; \\\\forall a. \\\\forall b.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists u. \\\\forall z. \\\\big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists (y \\\\in b). \\\\phi(x,y,z)\\\\big) \\\\implies \\\\exists (v \\\\in u). \\\\big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists (y \\\\in v). \\\\phi(x,y,z)\\\\; \\\\land\\\\; \\\\forall (y \\\\in v). \\\\exists (x \\\\in a). \\\\phi(x,y,z)\\\\big) } This Subset Collection axiom schema is equivalent to a single and somewhat clearer alternative Axiom of Fullness. To this end, let a\\\\Sigma{b} is the class of all total relations between a and b, this class is given as :r \\\\in a\\\\Sigma{b} \\\\iff \\\\big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists (y \\\\in b). \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle \\\\in r\\\\big) \\\\, \\\\land\\\\, \\\\big(\\\\forall (p \\\\in r). \\\\exists (x \\\\in a). \\\\exists (y \\\\in b). p = \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle\\\\big) With this, we can state {\\\\mathrm {Fullness}}, an alternative to Subset Collection. It guarantees that there exists at least some set c \\\\subseteq a\\\\Sigma{b} holding the a good amount of the desired relations. More conctetely, between any two sets a and b, there is a set c which contains a total sub-relation s for any total relation r from a to b. :Axiom of Fullness: :\\\\forall a. \\\\forall b.\\\\ \\\\ \\\\exists (c \\\\subseteq a\\\\Sigma{b}). \\\\forall (r \\\\in a\\\\Sigma{b}). \\\\exists (s \\\\in c). s \\\\subseteq r The Fullness axiom is in turn implied by the so called Presentation Axiom about sections, which can also be formulated category theoretically. In this context, the class of Dedekind cuts is finally a set. Indeed, {\\\\mathsf {CZFE}} plus weaker statements about the algebra of sets in {{\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb Q}} suffice. Neither linearity of ordinals, nor existence of power sets of finite sets are not derivable in this theory. Assuming either implies Power set in this context. Metalogic This theory lacks the existence property due to the Schema, but in 1977 Aczel showed that {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} can still be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory,Aczel, Peter: 1978. The type theoretic interpretation of constructive set theory. In: A. MacIntyre et al. (eds.), Logic Colloquium '77, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 55–66. (using the propositions-as-types approach) providing what is now seen a standard model of {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} in type theory. This is done in terms of images of its functions as well as a fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. As such, {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} has modest proof theoretic strength, see {\\\\mathsf {IKP}}: Bachmann–Howard ordinal. Breaking with ZF One may further add the non-classical axiom that all sets are subcountable. Then {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} is a set (by Infinity and Exponentiation) while the class {\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb N} or even {\\\\mathcal P}\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} is provably not a set, by Cantors diagonal argument. So this theory then logically rejects Powerset and {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}. In 1989 Ingrid Lindström showed that non-well- founded sets obtained by replacing the equivalent of the Axiom of Foundation (Induction) in {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} with Aczel's anti-foundation axiom ({\\\\mathsf {CZFA}}) can also be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory.Lindström, Ingrid: 1989. A construction of non-well-founded sets within Martin-Löf type theory. Journal of Symbolic Logic 54: 57–64. =Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel= The theory {\\\\mathsf {IZF}} is {\\\\mathsf {CZF}} with the standard Separation and Power set. Here, in place of the Axiom schema of replacement, we may use the { border=1 style=\\"border:0px\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #000000; padding:1.0em; background-color:#F8F9FA\\"  Axiom schema of collection: For any predicate \\\\phi, ; \\\\forall z. \\\\big(\\\\forall (x \\\\in z). \\\\exists y. \\\\phi(x,y)\\\\big) \\\\implies \\\\exists w. \\\\forall (x \\\\in z). \\\\exists (y \\\\in w). \\\\phi(x,y) } While the axiom of replacement requires the relation φ to be functional over the set a (as in, for every x in a there is associated exactly one y), the Axiom of Collection does not. It merely requires there be associated at least one y, and it asserts the existence of a set which collects at least one such y for each such x. {\\\\mathrm {LEM}} together with the Collection implies Replacement. As such, {\\\\mathsf {IZF}} can be seen as the most straight forward variant of {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} without {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}. Metalogic Changing the Axiom schema of Replacement to the Axiom schema of Collection, the resulting theory has the Existence Property. Even without {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}, the proof theoretic strength of {\\\\mathsf {IZF}} equals that of {\\\\mathsf {ZF}}. While {\\\\mathsf {ZF}} is based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, it is considered impredicative. It allows formation of sets using the Axiom of Separation with any proposition, including ones which contain quantifiers which are not bounded. Thus new sets can be formed in terms of the universe of all sets. Additionally the power set axiom implies the existence of a set of truth values. In the presence of excluded middle, this set exists and has two elements. In the absence of it, the set of truth values is also considered impredicative. History In 1973, John Myhill proposed a system of set theory based on intuitionistic logicMyhill, \\"Some properties of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\\", Proceedings of the 1971 Cambridge Summer School in Mathematical Logic (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 337) (1973) pp 206-231 taking the most common foundation, {\\\\mathsf {ZFC}}, and throwing away the Axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle, leaving everything else as is. However, different forms of some of the {\\\\mathsf {ZFC}} axioms which are equivalent in the classical setting are inequivalent in the constructive setting, and some forms imply {\\\\mathrm {LEM}}. In those cases, the intuitionistically weaker formulations were then adopted for the constructive set theory. =Intuitionistic Z= Again on the weaker end, as with its historical counterpart Zermelo set theory, one may denote by {\\\\mathsf {IZ}} the intuitionistic theory set up like {\\\\mathsf {IZF}} but without Replacement, Collection or Induction. =Intuitionistic KP= Let us mention another very weak theory that has been investigated, namely Intuitionistic (or constructive) Kripke–Platek set theory {\\\\mathsf {IKP}}. The theory has not only Separation but also Collection restricted, i.e. it is similar to {\\\\mathsf {BCST}} but with Induction instead of full Replacement. It is especially weak when studied without Infinity. The theory does not fit into the hierarchy as presented above, simply because it has Axiom schema of Set Induction from the start. This enables theorems involving the class of ordinals. Sorted theories =Constructive set theory= As he presented it, Myhill's system {\\\\mathsf {CST}} is a constructive first-order logic with identity and three sorts, namely sets, natural numbers, functions: * The usual Axiom of Extensionality for sets, as well as one for functions, and the usual Axiom of union. * The Axiom of restricted, or predicative, separation, which is a weakened form of the Separation axiom in classical set theory, requiring that any quantifications be bounded to another set. * A form of the Axiom of Infinity asserting that the collection of natural numbers (for which he introduces a constant N) is in fact a set. * The Axiom of Exponentiation, asserting that for any two sets, there is a third set which contains all (and only) the functions whose domain is the first set, and whose range is the second set. This is a greatly weakened form of the Axiom of power set in classical set theory, to which Myhill, among others, objected on the grounds of its impredicativity. * An Axiom of dependent choice, which is much weaker than the usual Axiom of choice. And furthermore: * The usual Peano axioms for natural numbers. * Axioms asserting that the domain and range of a function are both sets. Additionally, an Axiom of non-choice asserts the existence of a choice function in cases where the choice is already made. Together these act like the usual Replacement axiom in classical set theory. =Bishop style set theory= Set theory in the flavor of Errett Bishop's constructivist school mirrors that of Myhill, but is set up in a way that sets come equipped with relations that govern their discreteness. Commonly, Dependent Choice is adopted. =Category theories= Not all formal logic theories of sets need to axiomize the binary membership predicate \\"\\\\in\\" directly. And an Elementary Theory of the Categories Of Set ({\\\\mathsf {ETCS}}), e.g. capturing pairs of composable mappings between objects, can also be expressed with a constructive background logic ({\\\\mathsf {CETCS}}). Good models are the pretoposes mentioned in the Exponentiation section - possibly also requiring with enough projectives, an axiom about surjective \\"presentations\\" of set, implying Countable Dependent Choice. Beyond that, topoi also have internal languages that can be intuitionistic themselves and capture a notion of sets.

It stars Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Vikram (in his Hindi debut) in the lead roles, while Govinda, Nikhil Dwivedi, Ravi Kishan and Priyamani feature in key supporting roles. The film follows the crux of the epic Ramayana, with a ruthless police officer on the chase to find a tribal leader and lawbreaker, who has kidnapped his wife. Beera Munda, the kidnapper and his motive for the kidnap has been led on by the death of his sister, as a result of police custodial torture and brutal rape. The film explores the search by the officer, whilst exploring the changing emotions that the three protagonists experience with each other, leading to a riveting climax, situated in the jungle. This film is based on Stockholm syndrome. Raavan was announced in February 2008, whilst Abhishek and Aishwarya's collaboration in the second time after Guru (2007), creating more anticipation. Shooting began soon after, and took place in various locations with a record number of extras in areas including Chalakudy, Kerala and Ooty, Tamil Nadu amongst other regions throughout India. The film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics written by Gulzar, the cinematography was handled by V. Manikandan and Santhosh Sivan, and editing done by A. Sreekar Prasad. The film was simultaneously released in Tamil as Raavanan with the film's antagonist Vikram, playing the lead role, and Aishwarya Rai reprising her role in Tamil as well. Furthermore, the film was dubbed in Telugu as Villain. All the three versions released simultaneously on 18 June 2010 worldwide. The film's premiere was held in London on 16 June 2010.  Plot  Beera Munda, a bandit, jumps off a cliff into the water. His gang distracts the police and police vehicles are set on fire. Ragini Sharma, on a boating trip, is kidnapped by Beera. Dev Pratap Sharma, her husband and a superintendent of police, is informed of her abduction. A montage showcases Beera's story. He is seen as a local hero, who runs a parallel government, with his brothers, Mangal and Hariya, and is considered as a naxalites by the police. He kidnaps Ragini to avenge the death of his sister Jamunia. Ragini refuses to die at the bandit's hands and jumps off the cliff, but survives and Beera holds off her killing, as he sees it useless to kill someone who has no fear of death. Dev and his team enter the forests with the aid of a forest guard, Sanjeevani Kumar, but they are unable to find Beera. Beera and Mangal infiltrate the police tents when Dev is not present and come upon Inspector Hemant, Dev's junior and his assistant. They kidnap Hemant, take him to their hideout and bury him in the ground with only his head sticking out. Ragini discovers Hemant in this condition and reproaches Beera and Mangal for such inhuman acts. Beera tells the story of his sister's death; Dev had led an encounter against Beera during Jamunia's wedding. Dev's shot grazed Beera in the neck. Beera escaped, but Hemant captured and took Jamunia to the police station. She was kept in police custody all night and was serially gangraped by the policemen, when she refused to reveal Beera's whereabouts. The next day, she committed suicide by drowning in a nearby well. Hearing Beera's story, Ragini feels sorry for him. Then Beera reveals his feelings to Ragini, but she is still devoted to Dev. Sanjeevani Kumar sneaks into the place where Ragini is kept. He tells her of Dev's search for her, but Mangal comes from behind and captures Sanjeevani. He is taken as prisoner in front of Beera and tells him to return Ragini to Dev, or be responsible for the destruction of his people. Beera bluntly refuses the advice. Hariya convinces Beera to allow him to offer a truce to Dev. He goes with Sanjeevani to their camp. Dev initially agrees, but when Hariya comes out in the open, Dev kills him, revealing that the destruction of Beera is more important to him than saving his wife. Enraged at his brother's death, Beera sets the police tents on fire in an ambush attack with his gang. Dev and Beera come face to face for a final confrontation on an old mountain bridge. Dev fights Beera with brute force, but Beera outwits him. Beera saves Dev from falling to his death because his wife was waiting for him. Beera releases Ragini and she and Dev re-unite. However, Dev yells at an invisible Beera, vowing to return and destroy him. While on their way home, Dev accuses Ragini of infidelity and claims it was Beera who told him of it. Infuriated, Ragini leaves Dev to meet Beera through Mangal. They however realize Dev lied, hoping Ragini would lead him to his hideout. Dev appears with a police team and confront the duo, reminding Beera of his vow. Ragini stands in front of Beera to save him, but Beera pushes her out of the line of fire and is shot multiple times. Ragini tries to save Beera with all her might, but Beera falls off the cliff to his death with a smile.

Based on a short story by Ismat Chughtai, it was a musical period film set in the desert and was to star Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor in the lead. Though the film was slated to go on floors after the release of the former, there were reports of a fall-out between Ratnam and Khan due to creative differences. While cinematographer P. C. Sreeram denied the reports, the film's would-be lyricist Gulzar said there were actually problems with acquiring the copyright of the story, and composer A. R. Rahman even confirmed to having completed 80% of the film score. Yet, the project was put on the back burner for reasons unknown. Following the critical and commercial success of Guru, Ratnam announced his next film in February 2008. A modern-day retelling of the mythological epic Ramayana, the film again features the real life couple in the lead. The film was initially planned to be made only in Hindi and the idea for the Tamil version came later. In January 2009, while the film was in the making, it was further decided to dub the Tamil version to Telugu making it a tri-lingual. While the film was yet to be titled, it was widely reported in the media that the Tamil version was titled Ashokavanam in reference to the place where Sita was held captive by Ravana. Subsequently, the film was titled Raavan in Hindi, Raavanan in Tamil and Villain in Telugu. While the plot is inspired by Ramayana, the story is narrated from Ravana's perspective making him the protagonist. The film is centered on the 'Ashokavanam' episode where Ravana kidnaps Sita and keeps her in Asokavanam. Later Rama ventures to save his wife and bring her back. = Casting = While Bachchan and Vikram were roped in for the contrasting leads in Hindi, Ratnam asked them to swap roles in Tamil. Though Bachchan agreed initially, he grew sceptical being unfamiliar with the language. Eventually Prithviraj was cast in his place for the Tamil. Rai plays the female lead in both versions of the film. Manikandan was hired as the film's cinematographer; however, he walked out in May 2009 and was replaced by Santosh Sivan. The editing was done by Sreekar Prasad. Rai's costumes were exclusively designed by fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. Choreography was by Ganesh Acharya, Brinda, Shobana, and Astad Deboo. Peter Hein and Shyam Koushal choreographed the action sequences and Samir Chanda took care of production design. = Filming = Raavan was shot in numerous locations around India including the forests of Karnataka (Tumkur), Kerala (Athirappilly Falls), Ooty, Dharmapuri (Hogenakkal Falls), Jhansi, Kolkata, Mahabaleshwar and in the Malshej Ghats in Maharashtra. Principal photography commenced in October 2008, in the forests near Kochi, Kerala. A few scenes were filmed at Athirappilly Falls, Ratnam's favourite location. Incidentally, he has shot for the songs 'Jiya Jale' in Dil Se.. and 'Barso Re' in Guru at the same location. Forest officials banned the shooting at Malayattoor, an eco-tourism centre, for violating rules and constructing temporary huts, delaying the shoot for 11 days until the issues were resolved on 22 October 2008, while laying down reworked rules. The second leg of the shooting at Ooty that began in December 2008 was also delayed as local cab drivers protested the use of film federation (FEFSI) vehicles which affected their business, forcing a dejected Ratnam to call off the shoot temporarily and move on to Hogenakkal Falls. In February 2009, the crew advanced to Kolkata where the song 'Kalvare' was shot by the banks of Hooghly at Agarpara. Later, as the shooting resumed and progressed at Ooty, Ratnam fell ill in April 2009 and was hospitalised at Apollo Hospitals, causing a further delay of 47 days until filming resumed in June 2009 following his recovery. As the numerous delays affected his other projects, DOP Manikandan walked out in May and was replaced by Santosh Sivan. By July, the crew moved back to Kerala, to reshoot a few scenes at Chalakudy as Ratnam was reportedly unsatisfied after seeing the rushes. This time around, heavy rains played spoilsport leading to another delay in filming. Moreover, when an elephant brought for the shoot ran amok killing the mahout, the Animal Welfare Board served a show cause notice to the production company (Madras Talkies) for not taking permission to use elephants. The film began its last schedule in August 2009 at the Malshej Ghats in Maharashtra where the climax sequence was shot, the final encounter taking place on a wooden bridge. Production designer Samir Chanda built three identical bridges to facilitate the scene to be captured from different angles. Though initially planned to be built either in Sri Lanka, Australia or South Africa, the bridge was constructed in Mumbai to reduce costs. While bad weather and heavy rains disrupted shoot for a few days, the forest department filed cases against some crew members for trespassing. The film went into post-production by the end of 2009. Numerous action sequences were performed by the actors. The actors suffered from real cuts and bruises so they didn't need make up. The stunts were directed by Mani Ratnam and choreographed by Peter Hein, who received a Filmfare action award for the Hindi versions of Ghajini and Anniyan. For his introduction scene, the protagonist has to jump from a 90-foot high cliff near the Hogenakkal Falls into the river below. This risky dive was performed by a body double, Balram, a Bangalore based former national diving champion. Kalarippayattu, a martial art form origaniting from Kerala, was also featured in the film. Sunil Kumar, a Kalari gym trainer from Kozhikode, trained the actors. Dancer Astad Deboo choreographed a passionate chase scene and a tandav dance between Abhishek and Aishwarya for the film.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack for the film was composed by A. R. Rahman with lyrics penned by Gulzar. It features six songs and an additional song that was performed by Rahman at the audio launch. It was released on 7 May 2010 by T-Series. The additional track performed by Rahman, titled \\"Jaare Ud Jaare\\", was not included in the CD. The song was cited to be an \\"instant composition\\": \\"The night before the launch, Rahman closeted himself in his Mumbai studio and worked through the night to compose the song.\\" This song is believed to be included in the later stages. The soundtrack also features three additional songs that were featured in the movie. The same soundtrack was used for the Tamil version of the film, titled Raavanan, and the dubbed Telugu version of the film Villain, with the lyrics for the former was penned by Vairamuthu and the latter was penned by Veturi Sundararama Murthy, which is his last work before his death in May 2010. Both the versions were released by Sony Music.  Release  Raavan, along with its simultaneously made Tamil version Raavanan, and the dubbed Telugu version Villain, was released on 18 June 2010.  Reception  = Critical response = Abhishek and Aishwarya at the London premiere Among Indian film critics, Raavan received mixed reviews and responses. Rajeev Masand of IBN gave the film 1.5/5 and said, \\"Despite some eye-watering camerawork and a stunning action piece in the film's climax, the film  especially its first half  is a carelessly edited mess of long scenes that make little sense when strung together.\\" Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL rated it 2.5/5 and stated, \\"Raavan is more a choreographed musical-cum- psychological drama but without proper character backing. What makes the movie worth watching is the peaks in the second half, of course apart from the imagery.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated it 1.5/5 and said, \\"On the whole, Raavan is a king-sized disappointment, in terms of content.\\" Sukanya Venkatraghavan of Filmfare rated the film 3/5 and said, \\"Raavan has its moments but it lacks depth. The first half is fairly riveting but the second half slowly slips into a coma.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India rated it favourably at 3.5/5, saying, \\"There are enough punches in the second half to keep the momentum going, but by and large, the film scores mostly on art and aesthete.\\" Raja Sen of Rediff rated it 2/5 and said, \\"Raavan truly and tragically fails us is in taking one of our greatest epics, and making it unforgivably boring.\\" Parimal Rohit of Buzzine Bollywood said, \\"Raavan is ultimately a clever film, as it pushed the envelope on how one goes about defining who is good and who is evil.\\" , Raavan holds a 67% approval rating among eighteen US and UK film critics sampled on the Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.02 out of 10. Cath Clarke of The Guardian gave the film a rating of 2/5 and found it sexist, while New York Post critic Lou Lumenick wrote, \\"If you're not a fan of Bollywood movies – which have long resisted crossover attempts in this country despite the success of hybrids such as Slumdog Millionaire — Mani Ratnam's action melodrama Raavan probably isn't going to make a convert out of you.\\" However, Frank Lovece of Film Journal International found it a \\"cracklingly stylish, suspenseful psychological drama\\" with \\"a visual sense that evokes David Fincher at his darkest\\", and admired the dance numbers, \\"one taking place somewhat naturalistically at a wedding, the other essentially a stunning war dance.\\"Lovece, Frank. \\"Film Review: Raavan, Film Journal International, 18 June 2010 The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times likewise gave it positive reviews: Rachel Saltz of the former made it a Times \\"Critic's Pick\\" and lauded Ratnam as \\"a talented visual storyteller who directs action crisply and fills the screen with striking images\\" including \\"an eye-popping climactic battle\\",Saltz, Rachel. \\"An Indian Epic With Bollywood Glamour\\", The New York Times 18 June 2010 while Kevin Thomas of the latter said the film \\"is replete with dizzying camerawork, myriad complications, violent mayhem, broad humor, [the] usual musical interludes, a cliffhanging climactic confrontation and a finish that strikes a note of poignancy.\\"Thomas, Kevin. \\"Capsule movie reviews: '\\"Raavan, Los Angeles Times, 18 June 2010 = Box office = Raavan opened \\"below expectations\\" at the Indian box office, with the Hindi version earning Rs 60.1 million on its opening day. In North America, Raavan opened in 120 theaters and ranked No. 15 on the domestic weekend box office chart with $760. As of May 2018, the film had a total collection of 79 crores including 29 crores from Indian box offices and 50 crores worldwide. Although it was commercially profitable (made on a budget of 55 crores) the film was declared a flop by Box Office India. Unlike its Hindi counterpart, which tanked at the box office, the Tamil version tasted success in the South. During its opening weekend on 15 screens in Chennai, it was the number one film and netted , an opening weekend record then. Though the film opened to packed houses, it slumped a little due to mixed reviews but later picked up following a local holiday. The film collected $8 million at the box office in the first month of release including $400,000 from Kerala. It went on to make over 600 million at the worldwide box office and remained one of the top Tamil grossers of the year. Uk opening weekend. UK boxoffice second week. New York boxoffice.

Habana, representing the city of Havana, was the only team to play in the league every season of its existence and was one of its most successful franchises. In their early history they were known by their colors as the Reds; later they adopted the names of Leones or Lions. Throughout their existence they had a famous rivalry with Almendares. 1878–1899 In the first Cuban League season, played during the winter of 1878–79, the Habana'a captain (or playing manager) was Esteban Bellán, who had played professionally in the United States. At the time, Habana and other clubs in the league were amateur sporting clubs. Every team played 4 games (all played on Sundays and holidays). Habana went undefeated and was awarded a silk flag, also each of the winning players received a silver medal.Figueredo, pages 5–7. Habana went on to repeat its championship in 1879–80. The league did not play the next winter, and the following winter the season was terminated early without a champion. Thus, the next full season was 1882–83, and Habana again won the championship. After another winter without play, Habana won its fourth consecutive championship in 1885, with Ricardo Mora replacing Bellán as manager. The following winter, 1885–86, brought Habana its fifth consecutive championship, this time with an undefeated record of 6–0 and with Francisco Saavedra as manager. Adolfo Luján emerged as their ace pitcher, with 5 complete-game victories. He kept it up the following season, pitching another 5 victories as Habana won its sixth consecutive championship in 1887. The next season Habana was finally dethroned, as they finished in second place to Fe.Figueredo, pages 7–18. In 1889 Habana came back and regained the championship, going 16–4 in a season that had grown to 20 games. Luján pitched 10 victories, including a shutout over Progreso to clinch the pennant. The next winter, 1889–90, the Reds eked out their eighth victory in nine seasons, with a 14–3 record that placed them 2 games ahead of runner-up Fe. The following winter, 1890–91, brought Habana's first losing season, when they lost several of their star players to other teams as professionalism crept into the league. The next year Habana was able to lure back its deserters and regained the championship (their ninth in 11 seasons). Alfredo Arcaño led their hitters with a .361 average and a league- leading 3 home runs and 3 triples. The next two winters (1892–93 and 1893–94), Habana finished second (11–12) and third (13–11), despite strong offense from Arcaño, Valentín González, and Miguel Prats.Figueredo, pages 18–31. The winter of 1894–95, with the Cuban War of Independence underway, the Spanish government halted the season after violence broke out at a game between Habana and Almendares. Habana was leading the race by 4 games when the season was called. The next two winters, no baseball was held as war raged. However, in the winter of 1897–98, even though the war was still in full force, the Spanish government allowed the season to be played in the capital. The season again was terminated early, this time when the war broke out with the United States. Habana was in second place when the season ended, though no champion was declared. The next winter, peace had returned under the U.S. military occupation, and Habana won another championship, going 9–3 with Alberto Azoy as the new manager. Rookie pitcher José Romero went 5–2, and González led the league in batting (.414) and triples (3).Figueredo, pages 31–36. 1900–1933 The 1900 season brought integration to the Cuban League, as a new team, San Francisco, consisting of black players won the championship, beating Habana by 3 games. In the 1901 season, Carlos Royer emerged as Habana's new pitching ace with a record of 12–3, leading Habana back to the championship. The following season, Royer set a new standard as he pitched complete game victories in all of the 17 games played by Habana, including 3 shutouts, and never allowing more than 5 runs. His teammate, Luis Padrón, led the offense, leading the league with a .386 batting average, 4 triples, and 2 home runs. The next season, Habana won its third straight championship with Royer going 21–12. The season was decided in the last inning of a 5-game playoff with Fe, when Habana scored 3 runs to come back from a 5–3 deficit. First baseman Julián Castillo led the league in average (.330), hits (37), and triples (4), and tied for the lead in home runs (2). In 1904 Habana won its fourth title, with Royer going 13–3.Figueredo, pages 37-53.

While most educational films were made to be used in schools, training films were made and used by the military, and civilian industry. Countless training films were produced, in the days following the advent of sound film and before the beginnings of industrial video, that were a supplement (or sometimes the main course) to classroom or office training and education. Films were usually made with an eye toward current trends and viewpoints, and employed for years after production as long as the topic- specific concepts remained valid; consequently, many training films took on a quaintness or camp appeal, as time went on.

It had purview over the financial accounts of the House's contingent fund, as well as some matters related to facilities and staffing. In 1946, it was merged into the newly formed the Committee on House Administration. Jurisdiction Its jurisdiction covered all subjects \\"touching the expenditure of the contingent fund of the House, [and] the auditing and settling of all accounts which may be charged therein to the House.\\" In addition, the committee was responsible for the accountability of officers of the House, the procurement of rooms for the use of House committees and for the Speaker, and for recommending and authorizing the employment of such persons as stenographers, reporters of debates, janitors, and clerks and staff assistants for committees, members and senators. History The committee was created on December 27, 1803, and was made a standing committee in 1805. In 1911, the functions of the Committee on Ventilation and Acoustics were transferred to the Committee on Accounts, and in 1927 the functions of the Committee on Mileage were similarly transferred. In 1946, the Committee on House Administration was created by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which superseded ten standing committees, assuming the jurisdictions and functions of some of the oldest and longest standing committees of the House. Among the merged committees were the House Committee on Accounts, along with the Committees on Enrolled Bills (created in 1789 as Joint Committee), Elections (created in 1794), Printing (created in 1846), Disposition of Executive Papers (created in 1889), Memorials (created in 1929), and some functions of the Joint Committee on the Library (created in 1806 as a Joint Committee).

He was born in Red Bluff, South Carolina, in Marlboro County, South Carolina and attended schools at Bennettsville, South Carolina and Englewood, New Jersey as well as Bethel Military Academy (near Warrenton, Virginia) and Swarthmore College (in Pennsylvania.) He graduated from the Carolina Military Institute, studied law in the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, was admitted to the bar in 1883 and practiced in Bennettsville. He was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1890-1891 and was attorney general of the State from 1891 to 1897. And a time when Benjamin Tillman was making demagogic appeals to the white working class, McLaurin became one of the first upper- class South Carolinians to support him. Tillman in 1892 pinned the nickname \\"Little Curly Headed Joe\\" that stuck for the remainder of McLaurin's life. McLaurin broke with Tillman in 1894 and they became bitter enemies. Tillman accused him of accepting bribes from the Textile industry, which led to the famous fistfight between the two on the Senate floor on 22 February 1902. Both men were censured. McLaurin was elected In 1892 as a Democrat to the Fifty- second Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Eli T. Stackhouse; he was reelected to the Fifty-third, Fifty-fourth, and Fifty-fifth Congresses and served from December 5, 1892, until May 31, 1897, when he resigned. He was appointed and subsequently elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Joseph H. Earle and served from June 1, 1897, to March 4, 1903; he was not a candidate for reelection. In Congress, he specialized in fiscal affairs. McLaurin practiced Law in New York City. He later returned to farming in Bennettsville and was Elected to the South Carolina Senate, 1914-1915. He was author of the State warehouse system for storing and financing cotton, and served as State warehouse commissioner from 1915 until his resignation in 1917. He died at his estate near Bennettsville in 1934; interment was in McCall Cemetery. His home, the Robertson-Easterling- McLaurin House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

It existed in two separate incarnations: the Women's Royal Air Force from 1918 to 1920 and the Women's Royal Air Force from 1949 to 1994. On 1 February 1949, the name of the First World War organisation was revived when the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, which had been founded in 1939, was re- established on a regular footing as the Women's Royal Air Force. The WRAF and the RAF grew closer over the following decades, with increasing numbers of trades opened to women, and the two services formally merged in 1994, marking the full assimilation of women into the British forces and the end of the Women's Royal Air Force. The Central Band of the WRAF, one of only two all- female bands in the British Armed Forces, was disbanded in 1972. Some of its musicians transferred to the Band of the Women's Royal Army Corps. Strength The target strength had been a force of around 90,000, figures are unreliable until 1 August 1918, when the strength was 15,433, approximately 5,000 recruits and 10,000 transferred from the predecessor organisations. The first incarnation never exceeded 25,000. Depots Depots were opened in 1918 at Handsworth College, in Glasgow, at RAF Flowerdown and at York.

Compete America supports the idea that scientists, researchers, and engineers will continue to be in demand and drive economic growth and job creation. Because of this, they argue that arbitrarily low visa quotas and massive backlogs in the system plague the employment- based visa process. Compete America's legislative goals are: * The end of arbitrary obstacles to employment and permanent residency for foreign-born master’s and Ph.D. graduates from U.S. universities * A streamlined green card process * A market-based H-1B visa cap  Principles  Compete America supports the following principles: * The United States must grow domestic sources of talent, and our member organizations are committed to improving U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and encouraging more young Americans to choose careers in those fields. * U.S. employers must be able to recruit and retain foreign-born highly educated professionals – particularly after they graduate from a U.S. university – as an important complement to domestic sources of talent. * The U.S. employment-based visa system must be permanently fixed so that foreign-born talent can stay in the United States, innovating for America. * Brainpower is even more essential in a down economy, and future growth and job creation will be led by innovation, whether it’s new technologies, new cures or new sources of energy. America does not have a monopoly on brainpower, and in an increasingly competitive global environment, we have to retain the talent that will keep us leading worldwide innovation. * Strong, smart enforcement is needed, to protect American and foreign-national workers, and laws should punish bad actors and recognize that most employers who hire foreign professionals follow the rules scrupulously. * Immigration reform must safeguard the interests of American workers, while recognizing that excessive and protectionist measures that shut off access to foreign-national talent will only inhibit innovation, job growth and the resulting opportunities for American workers.

Almendares represented the Almendares District on the outskirts of the old city of Havana—when the league was founded it was still considered a suburban area, but later became a district within the enlarged city. Almendares was one of the most successful franchises in the Cuban League. In their early history they were known by their colors as the Blues; later they adopted the name of Alacranes (Scorpions). Throughout their existence they had a famous rivalry with the Habana baseball club. History Baseball in Cuba was more than a sport; it became part of Cuba’s national identity. As baseball grew in the United States, its popularity also grew in Cuba. Cubans living in the U.S. learned and loved baseball, and realized it would be important for their country to have this sport for national unity. For Cubans, baseball offered the possibility of national integration of all Cubans, of all classes, black and white, young and old, men and women.Perez 1999, p. 75 Baseball also offered the Cubans something new to do, a new source of membership, an opportunity participate in something that was perceived to be distinctly Cuban.Perez 1999, p. 80 Cuba had successful baseball teams and players, which tended to unify the country. The Cuban people took great pride in their success in baseball. After a period of intramural play, professional teams were established.Perez 1999, p. 71 The Cuban League was founded in 1878, two years after the birth of the National League in the U.S.Skinner 2004, p. 17 The original three professional clubs were the Habana, Matanzas, and Almendares. Teams were named for their areas. Almendares won its first championship in 1893–94, carried by pitching ace Juan Manuel Pastoriza, the first of many good club pitchers. One thing that made the Almendares Baseball Club so successful is that it built its team around pitching rather than hitting.Skinner 2004 Almendares had many successful pitchers, including José Méndez and Adolfo Luque. Almendares was the first Cuban team to play against a United States team,Perez 1999, p. 76 an 1881 game in Cuba, against the Bitter Hops Baseball Club. Throughout its existence Almendares had a rivalry with Habana. This rivalry started at the beginning of professional league play and lasted until the end. The club even had its own newspaper and magazine, called El Almendarista.Perez 1999, p. 78 These publications grew in popularity almost as fast as new teams started. In 1886 baseball in Cuba was drawing record crowds. A championship game between Habana and Almendares had more than 6,000 fans attending.Perez 1999, p. 77 Baseball was absent in Cuba from 1895 to 1897 due to the Cuban War of Independence, but it resumed immediately after the War of ended, when professional teams including the Almendares resumed play.Perez 1999, p. 256 After the War, public attendance to baseball games increased, to over 5,000 weekly at Havana games.Perez 1999, p. 256 Professional baseball clubs were not always racially integrated in Cuba. US racial barriers were first broken in Cuba in 1900,Perez 1999, p. 270 after which Cuban teams had access to the best Cuban players as well as those from the Negro league. Almendares was able to stay competitive the longest without acquiring players from the United States. Integrated baseball in Cuba served as a transition to integrated baseball in the US.Perez 1999, p. 270 In 1961 with Fulgencio Batista out of power and Fidel Castro taking over, professional baseball was abolished and replaced by the amateur Cuban baseball system. Baseball was not only important as entertainment; it also was important to Cuban culture. Among the most notable of the successes of Cuban baseball was the elimination of racial discrimination in Cuban baseball and the provision of expanded opportunities to play and watch the game throughout the island.González Echevarría 1999, p. 625 Through good times and bad, baseball persisted as a source of national identity and collective unity.Perez 1999, p. 272 References *Alexander, Charles C.

It runs in a northwest–southeast direction roughly centered on the village of Attica. In the former direction, it connects to U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Darien and serves as a more direct route into eastern Erie County. In the latter, it links to US 20A in Orangeville and is the most direct route between Attica and Warsaw, the county seat of Wyoming County. NY 238 was assigned in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as an Orangeville–Attica highway and extended northwest to Darien by the following year. Route description NY 238 north, south of Attica village NY 238 begins at an intersection with US 20A in an area of the town of Orangeville known as Halls Corner. It heads north as Halls Corners Road, passing through sparsely populated areas of the town and serving Dream Lake Campground, located east of NY 238 on Buffalo Road. At Buffalo Road, the route makes a slight turn to the northwest and enters the town of Attica. Across the town line, NY 238 passes by one of Attica's reservoirs on its way to the small hamlet of Attica Center, where the route encounters the southern terminus of County Route 42 (CR 42) and the eastern terminus of CR 39\\\\. Outside of Attica Center, NY 238 winds its way northward toward the village of Attica, passing the eastern edge of the Attica and Wyoming Correctional Facilities—more prominently the work farm operated by the facilities. Just outside the Attica village limits, NY 238 turns west, taking over East Main Street from CR 19 at a junction adjacent to the Attica Central Middle and High Schools. NY 238 continues west into Attica, initially passing quietly through mostly residential areas of the village. It soon enters the business district, where it connects with the northern terminus of CR 31 (Exchange Street). After three more blocks, the route descends into the Tonawanda Creek basin and meets with NY 98 at High Street. NY 238 turns north here, overlapping with NY 98 along Market Street for to Buffalo Street, where NY 238 turns northwest to follow Buffalo Street out of the village and into Genesee County. NY 238 heading south from US 20 in Darien Across the county line, NY 238 cuts across the southwestern corner of the town of Alexander on its way into the town of Darien. It closely follows the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line through this mostly rural area, and CR 45 follows a parallel routing to NY 238 on the opposite side of the tracks through much of the area. CR 45 leaves NY 238 just outside Attica, and rejoins the state route about later in Darien. As a result, one road which used to cross the tracks in this area—CR 36—has been cut in half, eliminating the requirement to maintain its grade crossing. After CR 45's western terminus, NY 238 turns more northward again, entering a residential area and terminating at a junction with US 20 in the hamlet of Darien. History NY 238 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment between Orangeville and Attica. It was extended northwest to Darien by the following year. The portion of NY 238 between Attica and Darien originally followed Attica Road (modern CR 45), crossing what is now known as the Southern Tier Line twice. NY 238 was moved onto its current, more northerly alignment by 1978, avoiding the railroad tracks entirely.

In 12-tone equal temperament, four major thirds add up to an octave, since it tempers the interval 128/125 to a unison. In magic temperament, this comma is not tempered away, and the sequence of notes separated by major thirds continues indefinitely. Instead of 128/125, 3125/3072 vanishes in magic temperament, where each 5/4 major third is made slightly narrow (about 380 cents ()), so that five of them add up to an approximate 3/1 (an octave plus a perfect fifth). A chain of these thirds can be used to generate a 7-tone scale with the following interval distribution (given in cents): :0 322 381 703 762 1084 1142 1201 Note that this represents only one possible tuning of magic temperament. The important property is that the major third is tempered slightly flatter than its just value of 386 cents, so that five of them less an octave yield a good approximation to the perfect fifth (702 cents). If the sequence of major thirds is continued, the next moments of symmetry are at 10-, 13-, and 16-tone scales. Magic temperament is compatible with divisions of the octave into nineteen, twenty-two, and forty-one equal parts, which is to say that these equal temperaments make reasonable tunings for magic temperament, and therefore a piece written in magic temperament can be performed in any of them.

The episode was written by re-imagined creator Ronald D. Moore, and directed by Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. It first aired on October 6, 2006 on the Sci-Fi Channel along with the following episode \\"Precipice\\". In the episode, the Cylons are in their fourth month of a military occupation on New Caprica, where the majority of the human population are residing. A resistance movement is trying to drive the Cylons away. Meanwhile, Admiral William Adama continues his plan to rescue everybody there. Unlike most episodes, it does not include a survivor count. The story behind the episode was inspired by several wars and occupations in the past, including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War. Several parts of the episode changed from the script, more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing. The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the scene. The episode was seen by 2.2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award. Plot Four months have passed since the end of \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\", where Cylons found the majority of the human population on a planet known as New Caprica, which had supposedly been hidden from DRADIS, and commenced their occupation. A few thousand humans had escaped in the remaining spaceships following Battlestars Galactica and Pegasus. Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) is continuing to work on a plan to free those trapped on New Caprica. His son and commander of Pegasus Lee \\"Apollo\\" Adama (Jamie Bamber) confronts his father on pushing his Viper pilots beyond the breaking point, to which Adama says Apollo is becoming \\"soft.\\" Apollo's wife, Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) surprises him by supporting the Admiral. On New Caprica, Kara \\"Starbuck\\" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) is placed in an elaborate prison cell made to look like her old apartment on Caprica by Leoben Conoy (Callum Keith Rennie), who is attempting to force her to fall in love with him. Starbuck kills him several times, though Leoben always downloads into another body. Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) is in a Cylon detention facility, where his right eye was forcibly removed. He is released when his wife Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) performs sexual favors for the Cylon Brother Cavil (Dean Stockwell). Tigh returns to Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco) and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas), who have been leading a resistance movement against the Cylons, having detonated a bomb in a Cylon docking facility as Tigh is released. Now free, Tigh resorts to escalating their efforts, by planning suicide bombings against the Cylons and any human collaborators. The resistance is given intelligence by an unidentified informant from the Cylon command structure, by use of a secret dead drop; flipping a dog bowl and hiding some documents inside the tent next to it. One piece of intelligence given is information on a Cylon communications blocker; the resistance makes use of that information to contact a Raptor orbiting the planet. The Raptor returns to Galactica with news they have made contact with the resistance on the planet. Next, the resistance plans to kill the President of the Colonies, Gaius Baltar (James Callis), who is unwillingly collaborating with the Cylons. They learn he is to attend a graduation ceremony for the New Caprica Police, an unpopular masked police force set up by the Cylons to allow the humans to police the city and do the Cylons' bidding. Tucker \\"Duck\\" Clellan (Christian Tessier), who has access to the ceremony and whose wife had been killed by the Cylons, agrees to suicide bomb the ceremony. Towards the end of the episode it is revealed that Baltar's aide, Felix Gaeta (Alessandro Juliani) is the informant. He learns that Baltar will not be attending the ceremony, but cannot alert the resistance in time. Duck attends the ceremony, and when Number Three (Lucy Lawless) comes to shake his hand, Duck detonates the bomb, killing everybody in the room. Production =Writing= \\"Occupation\\", and following episode \\"Precipice\\" were written by series creator Ronald D. Moore. The Cylon occupation of New Caprica, and the human resistance fighting them, was inspired by wars and military occupations from history, including the Quartering Acts, World War II, and the more recent occupation in Iraq. In the original writing, Moore did not originally consider including Tigh with an eye removed until the final drafts were written. Portraying actor Michael Hogan was initially hesitant with the idea. He recalled that when the producers called him to talk about how his character would be maimed, they suggested having an eye removed. Hogan responded by laughing, and the producers assumed he agreed. When Anders and Tyrol detonate the bomb at the beginning of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but \\"freaking the Cylons out\\" by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be \\"really potent and really powerful.\\" When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got \\"emotionally caught up in it,\\" adding \\"as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's why I want to do it. It really happens. People do this.\\" The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it.download link There was some debate among the writers on when Galactica and the fleet would be brought into the story. Moore decided to reintroduce the space-bound fleet in the beginning of the third act, in order to establish the story on New Caprica, and make the audience happy and more excited to see Galactica. Moore also decided to evolve one of the Number Eight Cylon models, Sharon Agathon (Grace Park) imprisoned on board the ship, where a year would allow Sharon and Admiral Adama to form a special relationship, eventually leading to Adama releasing her and allowing her to become a Colonial officer by the next episode. Moore felt \\"Occupation\\" was the best season premiere of Battlestar since \\"33\\", the first-season premiere, believing the writers \\"never quite matched\\" the performance on \\"33\\" in the following episodes. He also felt it was a better premiere than \\"Scattered\\" from the second season, as it contained disparate story lines where the characters were not fully reunited with each other until a few episodes in. =Filming and post-production= The episode began with one of the most extended recaps in the series, as the producers wanted to bring the audience up to date from the events from \\"Lay Down Your Burdens\\", which covered \\"quite a bit of ground\\" because of the large story development behind the finale. The scene where the Cylons meet in Colonial One became very tedious for the crew because several versions of the same Cylon model were used in the same shot, and the crew disliked filming on the set. Moore elaborated; The crew had to film different versions of the prayer scene before Duck commits the suicide attack. In making the photograph of him and his late wife, the actress who played Nora in the webisode series The Resistance was not available, so the producers digitally inserted her face onto the photograph. The episode includes a voiceover of Roslin detailing the occupation and resistance. This was not originally added in the final script, but was instead considered during post-production of the episode. The ending for the episode was originally Leoben presenting Starbuck with Kacey Brynn, her \\"daughter,\\" but for unspecified reasons, the scene was instead used for \\"Precipice\\". Reception =Broadcast and ratings= \\"Occupation\\" and \\"Precipice\\" was originally meant to be released as two separate episodes, however the producers decided to merge them to be released as a two-hour broadcast. The reasoning was partly due to the third episode \\"Exodus\\", which became too long and split to a two-part episode, and the producers did not wish to stretch the New Caprica storyline to several weeks. The first 13 minutes of the episode were leaked on the Sci Fi Channel website days prior the broadcast. The two-hour season three premiere was first broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on Friday, October 6, 2006 between 9 pm and 11 pm. After its original broadcast, the two-hour episode attracted a household rating of 1.8, equalling a total of 2.2 million viewers. Ratings were an increase of 2 per cent in total viewing from the average ratings from the second half of the second season. =Reviews= \\"Occupation\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN rated \\"Occupation\\" a \\"masterful\\" 10 out of 10, stating \\"watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica is a great reminder that this is truly still the best show on television.\\" Ian Berriman of SFX called the episode a \\"stunning season opener,\\" citing the similarities of the occupation of Iraq as its greatest strength, but also thought it was the episode's weakness. Berriman also liked Tigh's transformation to a \\"ruthless terrorist\\" and Starbuck's part of the episode. \\"Occupation\\" was rated five stars out of five. Patrick Sauriol of UGO started the review stating \\"After the events of season two's cliffhanger, there were a hundred questions on the minds of the show's fans, but the biggest one gets answered with the Season Three double-header premiere: was the start of Season Three worth the wait or has the show jumped the shark? Answer: You better frakkin' believe that Battlestar Galactica hasn't jumped the shark.\\" Sauriol commented that the time leap of a year was a \\"gutsy move,\\" but felt it has \\"always been the case\\" for the series. However, he also felt that all doubts the audience might have to harbor \\"that this show won't live up to the first two seasons should be wiped away.\\" Callis' performance was praised, with Sauriol stating \\"again Callis proves that he owns this role and again he proves tonight why Gaius Baltar is the best character on this show.\\" Sauriol graded \\"Occupation\\" and the following \\"Precipice\\" A-. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B. =Awards and nominations= In 2007, the episode was nominated for a 59th Primetime Emmy Awards for \\"Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series\\", but lost to HBO's The Sopranos series finale \\"Made in America\\". It was also nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for best Episodic Drama. However, the episode lost out to the pilot episode of Big Love.

Saunders, 2012, p.1097. In humans it is encoded by the VTN gene. Vitronectin binds to integrin alpha-V beta-3 and thus promotes cell adhesion and spreading. It also inhibits the membrane- damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpins (serine protease inhibitors). It is a secreted protein and exists in either a single chain form or a clipped, two chain form held together by a disulfide bond. Vitronectin has been speculated to be involved in hemostasis and tumor malignancy.  Structure  Vitronectin is a 75 kDa glycoprotein, consisting of 459 amino acid residues. About one-third of the protein's molecular mass is composed of carbohydrates. On occasion, the protein is cleaved after arginine 379, to produce two-chain vitronectin, where the two parts are linked by a disulfide bond. No high-resolution structure has been determined experimentally yet, except for the N-terminal domain. The protein consists of three domains: * The N-terminal Somatomedin B domain (1-39) * A central domains with hemopexin homology (131-342) * A C-terminal domain (residues 347-459) also with hemopexin homology. Several structures has been reported for the Somatomedin B domain. The protein was initially crystallized in complex with one of its physiological binding partners: the Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and the structure solved for this complex. Subsequently two groups reported NMR structures of the domain. The somatomedin B domain is a close-knit disulfide knot, with 4 disulfide bonds within 35 residues. Different disulfide configurations had been reported for this domain but this ambiguity has been resolved by the crystal structure. Homology models have been built for the central and C-terminal domains.  Function  The somatomedin B domain of vitronectin binds to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and stabilizes it. Thus vitronectin serves to regulate proteolysis initiated by plasminogen activation. In addition, vitronectin is a component of platelets and is, thus, involved in hemostasis. Vitronectin contains an RGD (45-47) sequence, which is a binding site for membrane-bound integrins, e.g., the vitronectin receptor, which serve to anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. The Somatomedin B domain interacts with the urokinase receptor, and this interaction has been implicated in cell migration and signal transduction. High plasma levels of both PAI-1 and the urokinase receptor have been shown to correlate with a negative prognosis for cancer patients. Cell adhesion and migration are directly involved in cancer metastasis, which provides a probable mechanistic explanation for this observation.

Previously, Mattrick was the President of the Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft. In this role, he was responsible for a collection of consumer businesses including Xbox 360, Xbox Live, Xbox One, Kinect, TV Music and Video services, Microsoft Mediaroom, PC and Mobile Interactive Entertainment as well as the manufacturing and supply chain for Microsoft. Prior to joining Microsoft in 2007, Mattrick served as the President of Worldwide Studios for Electronic Arts, where he worked for 15Don Mattrick Corporate Bio at Zynga.com years. At only 17, Mattrick founded Distinctive Software, which was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1991 and subsequently became EA Canada. Distinctive Software, Inc. In 1982 at age 17, Mattrick and Jeff Sember co-founded Distinctive Software (DSI) by creating a multi-level game that was called Evolution on the Apple II. Sember sold his equity stake in DSI to Mattrick in 1986 and Paul Lee joined the board in the same year. In 1989 Paul Lee invested in DSI becoming the only other shareholder and he also took on a full-time operating role as CFO/COO driving finance and operations. In 1991, Mattrick was Chairman and the majority owner of DSI while Tarrnie Williams served as CEO. In the prior year, DSI had received two unsolicited acquisition offers but Mattrick declined both and instead chose to reach out to Trip Hawkins (founder of Electronic Arts) to discuss synergies between the two companies. Three months later this led to the acquisition of DSI by Electronic Arts (ERTS) which was accomplished through a pooling of interest transaction in July, 1991. Electronic Arts was a NASDAQ listed company with a valuation of approximately $200M USD at the time of the deal - Mattrick and Lee converted their DSI shares into ERTS shares as a result of the transaction. Prior to the acquisition, DSI was the largest independent game developer in North America and had 75 full-time employees working on various projects with companies like Konami, Broderbund, IBM, Disney, Mindscape and Accolade.Geoff Mair interview with Don Mattrick, March 1, 2017.

It was the first of its kind in Dalmatia and Croatia. Ante Šupuk was a generally influential mayor of Šibenik, the first Croat mayor to be elected under universal suffrage in 1872. He held the office in three periods: 1873–1882, 1886–1892, and 1896–1903. During his tenure, the city built a number of features: a railroad connection (1877), waterworks (1879), a sewer system, and a new harbor, a new hospital building (1883). In 1893, Šupuk and one Vjekoslav Meichsner started a business and obtained a license to use the waters of river Krka, and in 1894 they obtained permission to set up electrical power lines on municipal property in order to start lighting the streets with electric power. The construction of the Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant started in 1894 and lasted for 16 months. It had a two-phase generator that produced 0.6 MW of electric power. It was connected to the city with an long 3 kV power line, where it was transformed to 110 V. On August 28, 1895, the first electric street lights lit up in Šibenik. This achievement made Šibenik the third city in the world with alternating current-powered street lights. In 1904, Šupuk's company built a new power plant, Jaruga II, still operational today.

Gore was Bill Clinton's running mate in their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair was re-elected in 1996. Near the end of Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but lost the election in a very close race after a Florida recount. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. Gore was an elected official for 24 years. He was a representative from Tennessee (1977–1985) and from 1985 to 1993 served as a senator from that state. He served as vice president during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. The 2000 presidential election was one of the closest presidential races in history. Gore won the popular vote, but after a controversial election dispute over a Florida recount (settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 5–4 in favor of Bush), he lost the election to Republican opponent George W. Bush in the Electoral College. Gore is the founder and current chair of The Climate Reality Project, the co-founder and chair of Generation Investment Management and the now-defunct Current TV network, a member of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc., and a senior adviser to Google. Gore is also a partner in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, heading its climate change solutions group. He has served as a visiting professor at Middle Tennessee State University, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Fisk University, and the University of California, Los Angeles. He served on the Board of Directors of World Resources Institute. Gore has received a number of awards that include the Nobel Peace Prize (joint award with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007), a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album (2009) for his book An Inconvenient Truth, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV (2007), and a Webby Award (2005). Gore was also the subject of the Academy Award-winning (2007) documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. In 2007, he was named a runner-up for Time 2007 Person of the Year. Early life and education Gore was born on March 31, 1948, in Washington, D.C., the second of two children of Albert Gore Sr., a U.S. Representative who later served for 18 years as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, and Pauline (LaFon) Gore, one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt University Law School. Gore is a descendant of Scots-Irish immigrants who first settled in Virginia in the mid-17th-century and moved to Tennessee after the Revolutionary War.Turque, Inventing Al Gore, p. 5. His older sister Nancy LaFon Gore died of lung cancer. During the school year he lived with his family in The Fairfax Hotel in the Embassy Row section in Washington D.C. During the summer months, he worked on the family farm in Carthage, Tennessee, where the Gores grew tobacco and hay and raised cattle. Gore attended St. Albans School, an independent college preparatory day and boarding school for boys in Washington, D.C., from 1956 to 1965, a prestigious feeder school for the Ivy League. He was the captain of the football team, threw discus for the track and field team, and participated in basketball, art, and government. He graduated 25th in a class of 51, applied to Harvard and was accepted. Personal life Gore met Mary Elizabeth \\"Tipper\\" Aitcheson at his St. Albans senior prom in 1965. She was from the nearby St. Agnes School. Tipper followed Gore to Boston to attend college, and they married at the Washington National Cathedral on May 19, 1970. They have four children—Karenna Gore (b. 1973), Kristin Carlson Gore (b. 1977), Sarah LaFon Gore (b. 1979), and Albert Arnold Gore III (b. 1982). In June 2010 (shortly after purchasing a new home), the Gores announced in an e-mail to friends that after \\"long and careful consideration\\", they had made a mutual decision to separate. In May 2012, it was reported that Gore started dating Elizabeth Keadle of California. Harvard, the Vietnam War, journalism, and Vanderbilt (1965–76) =Harvard= Gore enrolled in Harvard College in 1965; he initially planned to major in English and write novels but later decided to major in government. On his second day on campus, he began campaigning for the freshman student government council and was elected its president. Gore was an avid reader who fell in love with scientific and mathematical theories, but he did not do well in science classes and avoided taking math. During his first two years, his grades placed him in the lower one-fifth of his class. During his sophomore year, he reportedly spent much of his time watching television, shooting pool, and occasionally smoking marijuana. In his junior and senior years, he became more involved with his studies, earning As and Bs. In his senior year, he took a class with oceanographer and global warming theorist Roger Revelle, who sparked Gore's interest in global warming and other environmental issues.Turque, Inventing Al Gore, p. 59. Gore earned an A on his thesis, \\"The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947–1969\\", and graduated with an A.B. cum laude in June 1969.Turque, Inventing Al Gore, p. 388. Albert Gore Sr. delivering a speech to the 1968 Democratic National Convention which the younger Gore helped him write Gore was in college during the era of anti-Vietnam War protests. He was against that war, but he disagreed with the tactics of the student protest movement. He thought that it was silly and juvenile to use a private university as a venue to vent anger at the war. He and his friends did not participate in Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that \\"We distrusted these movements a lot ... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something we considered detrimental to our country.\\" Gore helped his father write an anti-war address to the Democratic National Convention of 1968 but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests. =Military service= Tipper and Al Gore on their wedding day, May 19, 1970, at the Washington National Cathedral Gore with the 20th Engineer Brigade in Bien Hoa as a journalist with the paper The Castle Courier When Gore graduated in 1969, he immediately became eligible for the military draft. His father, a vocal anti–Vietnam War critic, was facing a reelection in 1970. Gore eventually decided that enlisting in the Army would be the best way that he could contribute to the anti-war effort. This would also improve his father's reelection prospects. Although nearly all of his Harvard classmates avoided the draft and service in Vietnam, Gore believed if he found a way around military service, he would be handing an issue to his father's Republican opponent. According to Gore's Senate biography, \\"He appeared in uniform in his father's campaign commercials, one of which ended with his father advising: 'Son, always love your country'.\\" Despite this, Gore Sr. lost the election. Gore has said that his other reason for enlisting was that he did not want someone with fewer options than him to go in his place. Actor Tommy Lee Jones, a former college housemate, recalled Gore saying that \\"if he found a fancy way of not going, someone else would have to go in his place\\". His Harvard advisor, Richard Neustadt, also stated that Gore decided, \\"that he would have to go as an enlisted man because, he said, 'In Tennessee, that's what most people have to do. In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for The Castle Courier, stated that \\"anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't.\\" After enlisting in August 1969, Gore returned to the anti-war Harvard campus in his military uniform to say goodbye to his adviser and was \\"jeered\\" at by students. He later said he was astonished by the \\"emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing glances that ... certainly felt like real hatred\\". Gore had basic training at Fort Dix from August to October, and then was assigned to be a journalist at Fort Rucker, Alabama. In April 1970, he was named Rucker's \\"Soldier of the Month\\". His orders to be sent to Vietnam were \\"held up\\" for some time, and the Gore family suspected that this was due to a fear by the Nixon administration that if something happened to him, his father would gain sympathy votes. He was finally shipped to Vietnam on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the 1970 Senate election, becoming one \\"of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam.\\" Gore was stationed with the 20th Engineer Brigade in Bien Hoa and was a journalist with The Castle Courier. He received an honorable discharge from the Army in May 1971. Of his time in the Army, Gore later stated, \\"I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform.\\" He also later stated that his experience in Vietnam =Vanderbilt and journalism= Gore was \\"dispirited\\" after his return from Vietnam. NashvillePost.com noted that, \\"his father's defeat made service in a conflict he deeply opposed even more abhorrent to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't seem to have been deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, Gore has said he didn't see full-scale combat. Still, he felt that his participation in the war was wrong.\\" Although his parents wanted him to go to law school, Gore first attended Vanderbilt University Divinity School (1971–72) on a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship for people planning secular careers. He later said he went there in order to explore \\"spiritual issues\\", and that \\"he had hoped to make sense of the social injustices that seemed to challenge his religious beliefs.\\" In 1971, Gore also began to work the night shift for The Tennessean as an investigative reporter. His investigations of corruption among members of Nashville's Metro Council resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two councilmen for separate offenses. In 1974, he took a leave of absence from The Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School. His decision to become an attorney was a partial result of his time as a journalist, as he realized that, while he could expose corruption, he could not change it. Gore did not complete law school, deciding abruptly, in 1976, to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when he found out that his father's former seat in the House was about to be vacated. Congress (1977–1993) Gore began serving in the U.S. Congress at the age of 28 and stayed there for the next 16 years, serving in both the House (1977–85) and the Senate (1985–93). Gore spent many weekends in Tennessee, working with his constituents. =House and Senate= Gore in 1977 At the end of February 1976, U.S. Representative Joe L. Evins unexpectedly announced his retirement from Congress, making Tennessee's 4th congressional district seat, to which he had succeeded Albert Gore Sr. in 1953 open. Within hours after The Tennessean publisher John Seigenthaler Sr. called him to tell him the announcement was forthcoming, Gore decided to quit law school and run for the House of Representatives: Gore won the 1976 Democratic primary for the district with \\"32 percent of the vote, three percentage points more than his nearest rival\\", and was opposed only by an independent candidate in the election, recording 94 percent of the overall vote. He went on to win the next three elections, in 1978, 1980, and 1982, where \\"he was unopposed twice and won 79 percent of the vote the other time\\". In 1984, Gore successfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate, which had been vacated by Republican Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker. He was \\"unopposed in the Democratic Senatorial primary and won the general election going away\\", despite the fact that Republican President Ronald Reagan swept Tennessee in his reelection campaign the same year. Gore defeated Republican senatorial nominee Victor Ashe, subsequently the mayor of Knoxville, and the Republican- turned-Independent, Ed McAteer, founder of the Christian right Religious Roundtable organization that had worked to elect Reagan as president in 1980. Gore during his congressional years During his time in Congress, Gore was considered a \\"moderate\\" (he once referred to himself as a \\"raging moderate\\") opposing federal funding of abortion, voting in favor of a bill which supported a moment in silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, \\"I think it is wrong\\", and \\"I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another normal optional life style.\\" In his 1984 Senate race, Gore said when discussing homosexuality, \\"I do not believe it is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm.\\" He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups.Birnbaum, Jeffrey H..

Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, Gore said in 2008 that he thinks \\"gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage.\\" His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000. During his tenure in the House, Gore voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday. While Gore initially did not vote on the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 in January 1988, he voted to override President Reagan's veto the following March. Gore voted against the nomination of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States, as well as the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court. During his time in the House, Gore sat on the Energy and Commerce and the Science and Technology committees, chairing the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations for four years. He also sat on the House Intelligence Committee and, in 1982, introduced the Gore Plan for arms control, to \\"reduce chances of a nuclear first strike by cutting multiple warheads and deploying single-warhead mobile launchers.\\" While in the Senate, he sat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Rules and Administration, and the Armed Services Committees. In 1991, Gore was one of ten Democrats who supported the Gulf War.

During this time, Gore co-chaired the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future with Newt Gingrich. In addition, he has been described as having been a \\"genuine nerd, with a geek reputation running back to his days as a futurist Atari Democrat in the House. Before computers were comprehensible, let alone sexy, the poker-faced Gore struggled to explain artificial intelligence and fiber-optic networks to sleepy colleagues.\\" Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn noted that, Gore introduced the Supercomputer Network Study Act of 1986.Roads and Crossroads of Internet History by Gregory Gromov He also sponsored hearings on how advanced technologies might be put to use in areas like coordinating the response of government agencies to natural disasters and other crises.\\" As a Senator, Gore began to craft the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 (commonly referred to as \\"The Gore Bill\\") after hearing the 1988 report Toward a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by UCLA professor of computer science, Leonard Kleinrock, one of the central creators of the ARPANET (the ARPANET, first deployed by Kleinrock and others in 1969, is the predecessor of the Internet). The bill was passed on December 9, 1991, and led to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) which Gore referred to as the \\"information superhighway.\\" After joining the House of Representatives, Gore held the \\"first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co- sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming.\\" He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s. In 1990, Senator Gore presided over a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 countries which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, \\"under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment.\\" =Son's 1989 accident and first book= On April 3, 1989, Al, Tipper and their six-year-old son Albert were leaving a baseball game. Albert ran across the street to see his friend and was hit by a car. He was thrown and then traveled along the pavement for another . Gore later recalled: \\"I ran to his side and held him and called his name, but he was motionless, limp and still, without breath or pulse.... His eyes were open with the nothingness stare of death, and we prayed, the two of us, there in the gutter, with only my voice.\\" Albert was tended to by two nurses who happened to be present during the accident. The Gores spent the next month in the hospital with Albert. Gore also commented: \\"Our lives were consumed with the struggle to restore his body and spirit.\\" This event was \\"a trauma so shattering that [Gore] views it as a moment of personal rebirth\\", a \\"key moment in his life\\" which \\"changed everything.\\" In August 1991, Gore announced that his son's accident was a factor in his decision not to run for president during the 1992 presidential election. Gore stated: \\"I would like to be President.... But I am also a father, and I feel deeply about my responsibility to my children.... I didn't feel right about tearing myself away from my family to the extent that is necessary in a Presidential campaign.\\" During this time, Gore wrote Earth in the Balance, a text that became the first book written by a sitting U.S. Senator to make The New York Times Best Seller list since John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage. First presidential run (1988) Gore campaigned for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States against Joe Biden, Gary Hart, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Jesse Jackson, and Michael Dukakis (who eventually won the Democratic nomination). Gore carried seven states in the primaries, finishing third overall. Although Gore initially denied that he intended to run, his candidacy was the subject of speculation: \\"National analysts make Sen. Gore a long-shot for the Presidential nomination, but many believe he could provide a natural complement for any of the other candidates: a young, attractive, moderate Vice Presidential nominee from the South. He currently denies any interest, but he carefully does not reject the idea out of hand.\\" At the time, he was 39 years old, making him the \\"youngest serious Presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy.\\" CNN noted that, \\"in 1988, for the first time, 12 Southern states would hold their primaries on the same day, dubbed \\"Super Tuesday\\". Gore thought he would be the only serious Southern contender; he had not counted on Jesse Jackson.\\" Jackson defeated Gore in the South Carolina Primary, winning, \\"more than half the total vote, three times that of his closest rival here, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee.\\" Gore next placed great hope on Super Tuesday where they split the Southern vote: Jackson winning Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia; Gore winning Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Gore was later endorsed by New York City Mayor Ed Koch who made statements in favor of Israel and against Jackson. These statements cast Gore in a negative light, leading voters away from Gore who received only 10% of the vote in the New York Primary. Gore then dropped out of the race. The New York Times said that Gore also lost support due to his attacks against Jackson, Dukakis, and others. Gore was eventually able to mend fences with Jackson, who supported the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and 1996, and campaigned for the Gore-Lieberman ticket during the 2000 presidential election. Gore's policies changed substantially in 2000, reflecting his eight years as vice president. 1992 presidential election Gore was initially hesitant to be Bill Clinton's running mate for the 1992 United States presidential election, but after clashing with the George H. W. Bush administration over global warming issues, he decided to accept the offer. Clinton stated that he chose Gore due to his foreign policy experience, work with the environment, and commitment to his family. Clinton's choice was criticized as unconventional because rather than picking a running mate who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies and who was nearly the same age as Clinton. The Washington Bureau Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, \\"Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. ... And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years.\\" Clinton and Gore accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on July 17, 1992. Known as the Baby Boomer Ticket and the Fortysomething Team, The New York Times noted that if elected, Clinton and Gore, at ages 45 and 44 respectively, would be the \\"youngest team to make it to the White House in the country's history.\\" Theirs was the first ticket since 1972 to try to capture the youth vote. Gore called the ticket \\"a new generation of leadership\\". The ticket increased in popularity after the candidates traveled with their wives, Hillary and Tipper, on a \\"six-day, 1,000-mile bus ride, from New York to St. Louis.\\" Gore also debated the other vice presidential candidates, Dan Quayle, and James Stockdale. The Clinton- Gore ticket beat the Bush-Quayle ticket, 43%–38%. Vice President (1993–2001) The Clintons and the Gores as Chelsea Clinton rings a replica of the Liberty Bell, 1993 Al Gore served as vice president during the Clinton Administration. Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993. At the beginning of the first term, they developed a \\"two-page agreement outlining their relationship\\". Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings; he recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions. Clinton involved Gore in decision-making to an unprecedented degree for a vice president. Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's \\"indisputable chief adviser\\". However, Gore had to compete with First Lady Hillary for President Clinton's influence, starting when she was appointed to the health-care task force without Gore's consultation. Vanity Fair wrote that President Clinton's \\"failure to confide in his vice president was a telling sign of the real pecking order\\", and reported \\"it was an open secret that some of Hillary's advisers...nurtured dreams that Hillary, not Gore, would follow Bill in the presidency\\". Gore had a particular interest in reducing \\"waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government and advocated trimming the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations.\\" During the Clinton Administration, the U.S. economy expanded, according to David Greenberg (professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University) who said that \\"by the end of the Clinton presidency, the numbers were uniformly impressive. Besides the record-high surpluses and the record-low poverty rates, the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s; and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers, black Americans, and the aged.\\" According to Leslie Budd, author of E-economy: Rhetoric or Business Reality, this economic success was due, in part, to Gore's continued role as an Atari Democrat, promoting the development of information technology, which led to the dot-com boom (c. 1995–2001). Clinton and Gore entered office planning to finance research that would \\"flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry.\\" Their overall aim was to fund the development of, \\"robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks. Also earmarked [were] a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage.\\" Critics claimed that the initiatives would \\"backfire, bloating Congressional pork and creating whole new categories of Federal waste.\\" During the election and his term as vice president, Gore popularized the term Information Superhighway, which became synonymous with the Internet, and he was involved in the creation of the National Information Infrastructure. Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at UCLA on January 11, 1994, in a speech at The Superhighway Summit. He was involved in a number of projects including NetDay'96 and 24 Hours in Cyberspace. The Clinton–Gore administration also launched the first official White House website in 1994 and subsequent versions through 2000. President Bill Clinton installing computer cables with Vice President Al Gore on NetDay at Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, CA. March 9, 1996 Glenn T. Seaborg with Gore in the White House during a visit of the 1993 Science Talent Search (STS) finalists on March 4, 1993 Gore was also involved in environmental initiatives. He launched the GLOBE program on Earth Day '94, an education and science activity that, according to Forbes magazine, \\"made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment\\". In 1998, Gore began promoting a NASA satellite (Deep Space Climate Observatory) that would provide a constant view of the Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. During this time, he also became associated with Digital Earth. Gore negotiated and strongly supported the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gasses, but said upon his return that the administration would not submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until it was amended to include \\"meaningful participation by key developing nations\\",John M. Broder, \\"The Climate Accord: The Overview; Clinton Adamant On 3d World Role In Climate Accord\\" , The New York Times, December 12, 1997. The Senate had previously passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which declared opposition to any greenhouse gas treaty which would limit US emissions without similar limits on third-world countries such as China. The Clinton administration left office three years later without having submitted the treaty for ratification. The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the fund-raising activities had uncovered evidence that Chinese agents sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the 1996 presidential campaign. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. was used for coordinating contributions to the DNC.Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian, \\"Chinese Embassy Role In Contributions Probed\\", The Washington Post, February 13, 1997 FBI agents were denied the opportunity to ask President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore questions during Justice Department interviews in 1997 and 1998 and were only allowed to take notes.\\"Justice's Clinton, Gore inquiry criticized\\", Associated Press, December 16, 1999 In 1996, Gore became involved in a \\"Chinagate\\" campaign finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, \\"I did not know that it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake.\\" In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, \\"all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there was nothing wrong with that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law.\\" The phrase \\"no controlling legal authority\\" was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: \\"Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption.\\" Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted. Vice President Gore and Tipper Gore, 1997 During the 1990s, Gore spoke out on a number of issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice attempted to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim. Soon afterward, Gore also had to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, which involved an affair between President Clinton and a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, \\"He is the president of the country! He is my friend ... I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him.\\" After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, \\"I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now ... to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible.\\" Second presidential run (2000) There was talk of a potential run in the 2000 presidential race by Gore as early as January 1998. Gore discussed the possibility of running during a March 9, 1999, interview with CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer. In response to Wolf Blitzer's question: \\"Why should Democrats, looking at the Democratic nomination process, support you instead of Bill Bradley\\", Gore responded: In Manchester, New Hampshire, campaigning for President of the United States in 1999 Former UCLA professor of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News led to the creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have \\"invented the Internet\\", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that \\"we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet.\\" Cerf would later state: \\"Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit.\\" In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: \\"In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a \\"futures group\\"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen.\\"Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Al Gore in 'Internet Hall of Fame'. April 24, 2012. Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: \\"I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley ... Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day.\\" Gore himself would later poke fun at the controversy. In 2000, while on the Late Show with David Letterman he read Letterman's Top 10 List (which for this show was called, \\"Top Ten Rejected Gore – Lieberman Campaign Slogans\\") to the audience. Number nine on the list was: \\"Remember, America, I gave you the Internet, and I can take it away!\\" In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award \\"for three decades of contributions to the Internet\\" at the Webby Awards he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): \\"Please don't recount this vote.\\" He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to joke: \\"We all invented the Internet.\\" Gore, who was then asked to add a few more words to his speech, stated: \\"It is time to reinvent the Internet for all of us to make it more robust and much more accessible and use it to reinvigorate our democracy.\\" During a speech that he gave on June 16, 1999, in Carthage, Tennessee, Gore formally announced his candidacy for president. His major theme was the need to strengthen the American family. He was introduced by his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff. In making the speech, Gore also distanced himself from Bill Clinton, who he stated had lied to him. Gore was \\"briefly interrupted\\" by AIDS protesters claiming Gore was working with the pharmaceutical industry to prevent access to generic medicines for poor nations and chanting \\"Gore's greed kills.\\" Additional speeches were also interrupted by the protesters. Gore responded, \\"I love this country. I love the First Amendment ... Let me say in response to those who may have chosen an inappropriate way to make their point, that actually the crisis of AIDS in Africa is one that should command the attention of people in the United States and around the world.\\" Gore also issued a statement saying that he supported efforts to lower the cost of the AIDS drugs, provided that they \\"are done in a way consistent with international agreements.\\" While Bill Clinton's job- approval ratings were around 60%, an April 1999 study by the Pew Research Center for the People found that respondents suffered from \\"Clinton fatigue\\" where they were \\"tired of all the problems associated with the Clinton administration\\" including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment. Texas Governor and likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush was leading Gore 54% to 41% in polls during that time. Gore's advisers believed that the \\"Lewinsky scandal and Bill's past womanizing...alienated independent voters—especially the soccer moms, who stood for traditional values\\". Consequently, Gore's presidential campaign \\"veered too far in differentiating himself from Bill and his record and had difficulty taking advantage of the Clinton administration's legitimate successes\\". In addition, Hillary's candidacy for the open Senate seat in New York exacerbated the \\"three-way tensions evident in the White House since 1993\\", as \\"not only was Hillary unavailable as a campaigner, she was poaching top Democratic fund-raisers and donors who would normally concentrate on the vice president\\". In one instance \\"Hillary insisted on being invited [to a Los Angeles fundraiser for the vice president]—over the objections of the event's organizers\\", where the First Lady \\"shocked the vice president's supporters by soliciting donations for herself in front of Tipper\\". Gore faced an early challenge by former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. Bradley was the only candidate to oppose Gore and was considered a \\"fresh face\\" for the White House. Gore challenged Bradley to a series of debates which took the form of \\"town hall\\" meetings. Gore went on the offensive during these debates leading to a drop in the polls for Bradley. In the Iowa caucus the unions pledged their support to Gore, despite Bradley spending heavily in that state, and Bradley was much embarrassed by his two to one defeat there. Gore went on to capture the New Hampshire primary 53-47%, which had been a must-win state for Bradley. Gore then swept all of the primaries on Super Tuesday while Bradley finished a distant second in each state. On March 9, 2000, after failing to win any of the first 20 primaries and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore. Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and, in March 2000 even won the first primary election ever held over the Internet, the Arizona Presidential Primary. By then, he secured the Democratic nomination. On August 13, 2000, Gore announced that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became \\"the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second- highest office.\\" Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of the Clinton White House. Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay for prescription drugs and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush. =Recount= On election night, news networks first called Florida for Gore, later retracted the projection, and then called Florida for Bush, before finally retracting that projection as well. Florida's Republican Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, eventually certified Florida's vote count. This led to the Florida election recount, a move to further examine the Florida results. The Florida recount was stopped a few weeks later by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the ruling, Bush v. Gore, the Justices held that the Florida recount was unconstitutional and that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline, effectively ending the recounts. This 7–2 vote ruled that the standards the Florida Supreme Court provided for a recount were unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and further ruled 5–4 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by the December 12 deadline. This case ordered an end to recounting underway in selected Florida counties, effectively giving George W. Bush a 537Official Results , Federal Election Commission, updated December 2001. vote victory in Florida and consequently Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. The results of the decision led to Gore winning the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes nationwide, but receiving 266 electoral votes to Bush's 271 (one District of Columbia elector abstained). On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the election. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court's decision, but in his concession speech stated that, \\"for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\\" Post-Vice Presidency (2001–present) Gore in 2000 Bill Clinton and Gore had maintained an informal public distance for eight years, but they reunited for the media in August 2009. Clinton had arranged for the release of two female journalists who were being held hostage in North Korea. The women were employees of Gore's Current TV. In May 2018, he was included as a member of the Indian Government committee to coordinate year long celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary from October 2, 2019. =Criticism of Bush= Beginning in 2002, Gore began to publicly criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23 speech that he gave before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized Bush and Congress for the rush to war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, \\"Back in 1991, I was one of a handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War ... But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion.\\" In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called \\"religious zealots\\" who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: \\"They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith.\\" After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, \\"Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong ... I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country.\\" Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the \\"emptying out of the marketplace of ideas\\" in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately \\"redeem the integrity of representative democracy.\\" In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, \\"I think that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage.\\" In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: \\"I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy ... You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all.\\" While Gore has criticized Bush for his Katrina response, he has not spoken publicly about his part in the evacuation of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005, from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1, Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline, who had operated on his son Albert, through Greg Simon of FasterCures. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions at the hospital and asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment, two airlines each provided a plane with one flight later underwritten by Larry Flax. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III. Gore used his political influence to expedite landing rights in New Orleans. =Presidential run speculation= Chris Anderson asks: \\"Will you run again?\\" Gore replies, \\"Ohh, you aren't going to get me on this one!\\" People were speculating that Gore would be a candidate for the 2004 presidential election (a bumper sticker, \\"Re-elect Gore in 2004!\\" was popular). On December 16, 2002, however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004. While Gore seriously considered challenging Bush in 2004, the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent stratospheric rise in President Bush's popularity as a result of his response to these attacks were strong factors in Gore's December 2002 decision not to run again in 2004. Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to draft him into running. One observer concluded it was \\"Al Gore who has the best chance to defeat the incumbent president\\", noting that \\"of the 43 Presidents, only three have been direct descendants of former Presidents:\\" John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison, and George W. Bush, that \\"all three won the office only after... anomalies in the Electoral College\\", that the first two were defeated for re-election in a populist backlash, and finally that \\"the men who first lost to the presidential progeny and then beat them\\" (i.e. Andrew Jackson and Grover Cleveland) \\"each won a sort of immortality—having his image placed on a unit of US currency\\", and that Gore should answer this call of history.Woolley, Peter J. (August 7, 2003) \\"Black Hole of History\\", Scripps- Howard News Service in: Cincinnati Post, Sacramento Bee, Modesto Bee, Naples Daily News, Tri-City Herald, Marietta Daily Journal, Rock Hill Herald, Henderson Gleaner, Bakersfield Californian, Birmingham Post-Herald, Fresno Bee, Raleigh News and Observer, Tacoma News-Tribune; Woolley, Peter J. (Sept.-Dec. 2003) \\"A Pity for me and Al Gore\\", Journal of Irreproducible Results, pp. 61–62. The draft movement, however, failed to convince Gore to run. The prospect of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 in light of the upcoming 2008 presidential election. Although Gore frequently stated that he had \\"no plans to run\\", he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run. This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. The director of the film, Davis Guggenheim, stated that after the release of the film, \\"Everywhere I go with him, they treat him like a rock star.\\" After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award, Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars. During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the \\"greening\\" of the ceremony itself. Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president. However, background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage, implying that it was a rehearsed gag, which he later acknowledged. After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary, speculation increased about a possible presidential run. Gore's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running, he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards. Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run. Gore, however, remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency. Interest in having Gore run for the 2016 presidential election arose in 2014 and again in 2015, although he did not declare any intention to do so. =Involvement in presidential campaigns= Gore speaks during the final day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado After announcing he would not run in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Gore endorsed Vermont governor Howard Dean in December 2003, weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. He was criticized for this endorsement by eight Democratic contenders particularly since he did not endorse his former running mate Joe Lieberman (Gore preferred Dean over Lieberman because Lieberman supported the Iraq War and Gore did not). Dean's campaign soon became a target of attacks and eventually failed, with Gore's early endorsement being credited as a factor. In The New York Times, Dean stated: \\"I actually do think the endorsement of Al Gore began the decline.\\" The Times further noted that \\"Dean instantly amplified his statement to indicate that the endorsement from Mr. Gore, a powerhouse of the establishment, so threatened the other Democratic candidates that they began the attacks on his candidacy that helped derail it.\\" Dean's former campaign manager, Joe Trippi, also stated that after Gore's endorsement of Dean, \\"alarm bells went off in every newsroom in the country, in every other campaign in the country\\", indicating that if something did not change, Dean would be the nominee. Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6 million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid. Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention. During the 2008 primaries, Gore remained neutral toward all of the candidates which led to speculation that he would come out of a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a \\"compromise candidate\\" if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because he did not want to repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 presidential election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected president during the 2008 presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as \\"an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis.\\" Gore repeated his neutrality eight years later during the Democratic presidential primaries of 2016 until endorsing Hillary Clinton on July 25, 2016, the first day of that year's Democratic National Convention. Gore appeared with her at a rally on Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus on October 11, 2016. At the event, he said that he didn't want what happened to him to happen to Clinton. In the end, Clinton won the popular vote while losing the electoral college, which is what happened to Gore. =Environmentalism= Gore receives the Nobel Peace Prize in the city hall of Oslo, 2007 President George W. Bush meets with Al Gore and the other 2007 Nobel Award recipients, November 26, 2007 Gore has been involved with environmental issues since 1976 when as a freshman congressman, he held the \\"first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming.\\" He continued to speak on the topic throughout the 1980s, and is still prevalent in the environmental community. He was known as one of the Atari Democrats, later called the \\"Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party.\\" In 1990, Senator Gore presided over a three-day conference with legislators from over 42 countries which sought to create a Global Marshall Plan, \\"under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment.\\" In the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95–0) the Byrd–Hagel Resolution (S. Res. 98), which stated the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing as well as industrialized nations or \\"would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States\\". In 2004, he co-launched Generation Investment Management, a company for which he serves as Chair. A few years later, Gore also founded The Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization which eventually founded the We Campaign. Gore also became a partner in the venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, heading that firm's climate change solutions group. He also helped to organize the Live Earth benefit concerts. In 2010, he attended WE Day (Vancouver, Canada), a WE Charity event. Gore's speech on Global Warming at the University of Miami BankUnited Center, February 28, 2007 In 2013, Gore became a vegan. He had earlier admitted that \\"it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets across the world is one of the issues connected to this global crisis – not only because of the [carbon dioxide] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process\\" and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said \\"Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like. ... I felt better, so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life.\\" Gore's An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, a sequel to his 2006 film, An Inconvenient Truth, premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. The film documents his continuing efforts to battle climate change. A \\"Climate and Health Summit\\" which was originally going to be held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was cancelled without warning in late January 2017. A few days later, Gore revived the summit, which he will hold without the CDC. =Criticism against Gore= A conservative Washington, D.C. think tank and a Republican member of Congress, among others, have claimed that Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies in which he has a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.FactCheck.org: Al Gore's Mansion . June 21, 2009. Data in An Inconvenient Truth have been questioned. In a 2007 court case, a British judge said that while he had \\"no doubt ...the film was broadly accurate\\" and its \\"four main scientific hypotheses ...are supported by a vast quantity of research\\", – full text of judgment he upheld nine of a \\"long schedule\\" of alleged errors presented to the court. He ruled that the film could be shown to schoolchildren in the UK if guidance notes given to teachers were amended to balance out the film's one-sided political views. Gore's spokeswoman responded in 2007 that the court had upheld the film's fundamental thesis and its use as an educational tool. In 2009, Gore described the British court ruling as being \\"in my favor.\\" In the late 1980s and 1990s, Gore was criticized for his involvement in asking the EPA for less strict pollution controls for the Pigeon River. Gore was also criticized when in 2012 he sold his television channel Current TV for around $100 million to Al Jazeera, a media company founded by Qatar, a nation largely dependent on income from the fossil fuel industry. =Meeting with Ivanka and Donald Trump= President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka reported that she intended to make climate change one of her signature issues while her father served as President of the United States. She therefore contacted Al Gore, and he met with her and her father on December 5, 2016, at Trump Tower. Following his visit, Gore spoke briefly to the media standing outside the elevator of Trump Tower. Gore related that: \\"I had a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the president-elect, Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued, and I'm just going to leave it at that.\\" Awards and honors Gore is the recipient of a number of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize (together with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in 2007, a Primetime Emmy Award for Current TV in 2007, a Webby Award in 2005 and the Prince of Asturias Award in 2007 for International Cooperation. He also starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007 and wrote the book An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It, which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009.

Early years Born in Long Beach, California, Chandler was raised in Whittier and graduated from Whittier High School in 1967. He was considered one of the best all-around high school athletes to play in southern California. He was All-CIF in football and basketball and was one of the country's top high school decathletes, high-jumping , pole-vaulted more than , and put the shot . College career Chandler played college football at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles; he was a captain and the team's leading receiver during his senior year in 1970. He played in two Rose Bowl games; as a junior he was named Most Valuable Player of the 1970 Rose Bowl. In the third quarter, Chandler caught a 33-yard touchdown pass from Trojan quarterback Jimmy Jones and broke several Michigan tackles to score and gave USC its margin of victory, 10–3. Professional career A seventh round pick in the 1971 NFL Draft, Chandler played nine seasons with the Buffalo Bills and three with the Oakland Raiders (who moved to Los Angeles by his final playing season) He led the NFL in receptions from with 176, and was named Second-Team All-Pro in and . He also caught four passes for 77 yards in the Raiders' 27–10 Super Bowl XV victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in January 1981. In the first game of the 1981 season against the Denver Broncos, Chandler stretched out for a pass and took a hit so severely it ruptured his spleen. Chandler was rushed to a Denver hospital where doctors saved his life. Chandler made a miraculous recovery and returned to the field later in the season, appearing in a total of eleven regular season games.. Though he wasn't able to return right away as a receiver, he was able to resume his normal duties holding the ball for Raiders placekicker Chris Bahr.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/09/17/Fans-attending-Oaklands- regular-season-home-opener-against-Seattle/1552369547200/ In his rookie season of 1971, Chandler saw action in only a handful of games, finishing the season five receptions for 60 yards. Bills coach Harvey Johnson was dismissed at the end of the season and the Bills named Lou Saban as their new head coach. Saban began to use Chandler more in the offense, as Chandler was a starter in all 14 games that season. He scored his first professional touchdown in a 38-14 blow out of the New England Patriots. The opposing quarterback that day was Jim Plunkett, who would be Chandler's teammate on the Raiders several years later.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197210080buf.htm Over the next several seasons for Buffalo, Chandler would be one of the core starters and a favorite target of Bills quarterback Joe Ferguson. Chandler's role was greatly reduced under coach Chuck Knox in 1979. Knox preferred a solid ground game over the passing game. In 1980, Chandler was traded to the Raiders for LB Phil Villapiano and was part of a Raiders team that was the first wild card team to advance to the Super Bowl. He retired in July 1983; for his career, he had 370 receptions for 5,243 yards and 48 touchdowns, along with 11 carries for 18 yards. Chandler and running back O.J. Simpson were teammates for a season in college (1968) and seven in the pros at Buffalo (1971–77). Broadcasting career Chandler served as a color analyst for NFL games on NBC in 1983, hosted 2 On The Town for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles from 1984–1987, was a sports reporter for KABC-TV in the late 1980s and hosted Amazing Games (a global documentary series about the world's most exotic sports) for ESPN in 1989. He also served as a \\"Technical Advisor\\" for the humor book The Unofficial NFL Players Handbook. Personal life Chandler's father Gene was the mayor of Whittier, California from 1987 to 1988. Chandler married his college sweetheart, Marilyn, and had three children: Marisa, Justin, and Emma. Chandler earned a law degree from Western State University College of Law. Chandler posed for Playgirl magazine in January 1982. Chandler's niece Sarah George Chester and her daughter Payton were two of the nine victims, along with Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, on board the helicopter that crashed in Calabasas, California on January 26, 2020. Death Chandler began experiencing a nagging cough in 1994. A rare strain of lung cancer was discovered in his lungs in September 1994. He continued to work on Raider broadcasts while undergoing chemotherapy treatment at the USC Norris Cancer Center, but died there on Friday, January 27, 1995, at the age of 45, after a four-month battle with cancer. He was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. Legacy In 1996, USC established the annual Bob Chandler Award, given to an underclassman based on his athletic ability, academic scholarship as well as character on and off the field. The award funds a scholarship for the player's full tuition, room, and board for the following year. Chandler was inducted into the USC Hall of Fame in November 1999. Highlights of his USC athletic career are on permanent display in USC's Heritage Hall lobby. Whittier High School's sports facilities are named the Bob Chandler Sports Complex.

It was at least in length. It lived in present-day France during the Early Permian. It was a medium-sized predator, feeding on insects and small vertebrates. Discovery and history =Haptodus baylei= Haptodus baylei, the type species of Haptodus, is known only from a single, badly preserved specimen hosted in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris. It was collected at Les Télots, near Autun of France, from a terrestrial horizon dating to the Asselian stage of the Cisuralian series, about 299-296.4 million years old. The taxonomy of many pelycosaurs was revised in details by Alfred Sherwood Romer & Llewellyn Price (1940). They synonymized many genera, including Callibrachion (from Margenne near Autun, France), Datheosaurus (from Nowa Ruda of Poland), Palaeohatteria and Pantelosaurus (both from Germany), with Haptodus, but retained these taxa as distinct species. After describing H. garnettensis in 1977, Currie (1979) synonymized all European haptodontines, as well as Cutleria wilmarthi, with the type of the genus, H. baylei. Later, Laurin (1993 and 1994) considered Haptodontinae to represent a polyphyletic grade of basal sphenacodonts, and revalidated Cutleria, Palaeohatteria and Pantelosaurus, while Callibrachion was considered to be a nomen dubium and Datheosaurus was not examined. Laurin also suggested that the type species of the genus H. baylei might be a nomen dubium. His revision has been accepted by subsequent authors. =Other species= \\"Haptodus\\" garnettensis, which may belong in a different genus Haptodus garnettensis was named based on the holotype RM 14156, a partially articulated skeleton (cranial and postcranial) of an immature individual. More than 16 well-preserved specimen of various ontogenetic stages were referred to this species. All specimens came from the Garnett Quarry, located in the Anderson County of Kansas. They were collected from the Rock Lake Member of the Stanton Formation (Lansing Group), dating to the late Kasimovian stage of the late Pennsylvanian series, about 305-303.9 million years old. Another species, Haptodus grandis, was named from a maxilla (Gz 1071) found in Pennsylvanian to Cisuralian deposits in Kenilworth, England by Roberta Paton in 1974. In his 2015 dissertation revising the basal Sphenacodontia, Frederik Spindler demonstrated that H. garnettensis and H. grandis do not belong in the same genus as H. baylei and instead represent distinct genera. Spindler referred \\"H.\\" grandis to a new genus Hypselohaptodus in 2019. He also showed that some specimens referred to \\"H.\\" garnettensis belong to different taxa; one of these, ROM 43608, was named by Spindler in 2020 as a new genus and species, Kenomagnathus.

It rose to particular prominence globally during the second half of the 20th century, largely due to the international success of the style known as magical realism. As such, the region's literature is often associated solely with this style, with the 20th Century literary movement known as Latin American Boom, and with its most famous exponent, Gabriel García Márquez. Latin American literature has a rich and complex tradition of literary production that dates back many centuries. History = Pre-Columbian literature = Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the Quiché of Guatemala. = Colonial literature = From the very moment when Europeans encountered the New World, early explorers and conquistadores produced written accounts and crónicas of their experience, such as Columbus's letters or Bernal Díaz del Castillo's description of the conquest of Mexico. At times, colonial practices stirred a lively debate about the ethics of colonization and the status of the indigenous peoples, as reflected for instance in Bartolomé de las Casas's Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies. Mestizos and natives also contributed to the body of colonial literature. Authors such as El Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and Guaman Poma wrote accounts of the Spanish conquest that show a perspective that often contrasts with the colonizers' accounts. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, the context within which Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Toward the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive criollo literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi's El Periquillo Sarniento (1816). The \\"libertadores\\" themselves were also often distinguished writers, such as Simón Bolívar and Andrés Bello. = Nineteenth-century Literature = The 19th century was a period of \\"foundational fictions\\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the Romantic or Naturalist traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focused on the role and rights of the indigenous or the dichotomy of \\"civilization or barbarism\\", pioneered in Latin America by Esteban Echeverría The Slaughteryard (2010), by Esteban Echeverría, Norman Thomas di Giovanni and Susan Ashe, trans by Juan María Gutiérrez, (HarperCollins Publishers: London) who was influenced by the Parisian romantics while he lived there from 1825-1930. Romanticism was then taken up by other prominent literary figures, for which see, the Argentine Domingo Sarmiento's Facundo (1845). Likewise, Alberto Blest Gana's Martin Rivas (1862), widely acknowledged as the first Chilean novel, was at once a passionate love story and a national epic about revolution. Other foundation fictions include the Colombian Jorge Isaacs's María (1867), Ecuadorian Juan León Mera's Cumandá (1879), or the Brazilian Euclides da Cunha's Os Sertões (1902). Such works are still the bedrocks of national canons, and usually mandatory elements of high school curricula. Other important works of 19th century Latin American literature include regional classics, such as José Hernández's epic poem Martín Fierro (1872). The story of a poor gaucho drafted to fight a frontier war against Indians, Martín Fierro is an example of the \\"gauchesque\\", an Argentine genre of poetry centered around the lives of gauchos. The literary movements of the nineteenth century in Latin America range from Neoclassicism at the beginning of the century to Romanticism in the middle of the century, to Realism and Naturalism in the final third of the century, and finally to the invention of Modernismo, a distinctly Latin American literary movement, at the end of the nineteenth century. The next sections discuss prominent trends in these movements more thoroughly. = Romanticism, Realism, Naturalism, and Emerging Literary Trends = The Latin American wars of Independence that occurred in the early nineteenth century in Latin America led to literary themes of identity, resistance, and human rights. Writers often followed and innovated popular literary movements (such as Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism), but many were also exploring ideas such as nationalism and independence. Cultural independence spread across Latin America during this time, and writers depicted Latin American themes and locations in their works. While literature that questioned the colonial order may have emerged initially during the seventeenth century in Latin America, it rose in popularity in the form of resistance against Spain, the United States, and other imperialist nations in the nineteenth century. Latin American writers sought a Latin American identity, and this would later be closely tied with the Modernismo literary movement. Male authors mainly dominated colonial literature, with the exception of literary greats such as Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, but a shift began in the nineteenth century that allowed for more female authors to emerge. An increase in women's education and writing brought some women writers to the forefront, including the Cuban Romantic author Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda with the novel Sab (1841), a romantic novel offering subtle critique of slavery and the treatment of women in Cuba, the Peruvian Naturalist author Clorinda Matto de Turner who wrote what is considered one of the most important novels of \\"indigenismo\\" in the 19th century: Aves sin nido (1889), and the Argentinian Romantic writer Juana Manuela Gorriti (1818-1892), who penned a variety of novels and short stories, such as La hija del mashorquero (1860) and directed a literary circle in Peru. A Naturalist trail- blazer, Peruvian Mercedes Cabello de Carbonera penned Blanca Sol (1888) to critique women's lack of practical work options in her society. Women writers of the nineteenth century often wrote about the inequalities in Latin America that were vestiges of colonialism such as the marginalization and oppression of Indigenous peoples, slaves, and women. Many works by women in this period challenged Latin American patriarchal societies. These prominent women writers discussed the hypocrisy of the dominant class and institutions that existed in their nascent nations and criticized the corruption of the government. Some prime examples of such works include Clorinda Matto de Turner's Indole, Herencia, and El Conspirador: autobiografia de un hombre publico. =Modernismo, the Vanguards, and Boom precursors= In the late 19th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was the Nicaraguan Rubén Darío's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer as much of an issue and authors sought to establish Latin American connections. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere. In 1900 the Uruguayan José Enrique Rodó wrote what became read as a manifesto for the region's cultural awakening, Ariel. Delmira Agustini, one of the female figures of modernismo, wrote poetry that both utilized typical modernist images (such as swans) and adapted them with feminist messages and erotic themes, as critic Sylvia Molloy describes. Though modernismo itself is often seen as aestheticist and anti-political, some poets and essayists, Martí among them but also the Peruvians Manuel González Prada and José Carlos Mariátegui, introduced compelling critiques of the contemporary social order and particularly the plight of Latin America's indigenous peoples. In this way, the early twentieth century also saw the rise of indigenismo, a trend previously popularized by Clorinda Matto de Turner, that was dedicated to representing indigenous culture and the injustices that such communities were undergoing, as for instance with the Peruvian José María Arguedas and the Mexican Rosario Castellanos. Resistance against colonialism, a trend that emerged earlier in the nineteenth century, was also extremely important in modernismo. This resistance literature was promoted by prominent modernists including the aforementioned José Martí (1853-1895) and Rubén Darío (1867-1916). Martí warned readers about the imperialistic tendencies of the United States and described how Latin America should avoid allowing the United States to intervene in their affairs. A prime example of this sort of message is found in Martí's Our America, published in 1892. Darío also worked to highlight the threat of American imperialism, which can be seen in his poem To Roosevelt, as well as his other works Cake-Walk: El Baile de Moda. Many of his works were published in La Revista Moderna de Mexico, a modernist magazine of the time. The Argentine Jorge Luis Borges invented what was almost a new genre, the philosophical short story, and would go on to become one of the most influential of all Latin American writers. At the same time, Roberto Arlt offered a very different style, closer to mass culture and popular literature, reflecting the urbanization and European immigration that was shaping the Southern Cone. Both writers were the most important emergents in an important controversy in argentinian literature between the so-called Florida Group of Borges and other writers and artists that used to meet at the Richmond Cafe in the centrical Florida street of Buenos Aires city vs. the Boedo Group of Roberto Arlt that used to meet at the Japanese Cafe in the most periferical Boedo borough of the same city. The Venezuelan Romulo Gallegos wrote in 1929 what came to be one of the most well known Latin American novels in the twentieth century, Doña Barbara. Doña Barbara is a realist novel describing the conflict between civilization and barbarism in the plainlands of South America, and is a masterpiece of criollismo. The novel became an immediate hit, being translated into over forty languages. Notable figures in Brazil at this time include the exceptional novelist and short story writer Machado de Assis, whose both ironic view and deep psychological analysis introduced a universal scope in Brazilian prose, the modernist poets Mário de Andrade, Oswald de Andrade (whose \\"Manifesto Antropófago\\" praised Brazilian powers of transculturation), and Carlos Drummond de Andrade. In the 1920s Mexico, the Stridentism and los Contemporáneos represented the influx of avant-garde movements, while the Mexican Revolution inspired novels such as Mariano Azuela's Los de abajo, a committed work of social realism and the revolution and its aftermath would continue to be a point of reference for Mexican literature for many decades. In the 1940s, the Cuban novelist and musicologist Alejo Carpentier coined the term \\"lo real maravilloso\\" and, along with the Mexican Juan Rulfo and the Guatemalan Miguel Ángel Asturias, would prove a precursor of the Boom and its signature style of \\"magic realism\\". =Poetry after Modernismo= Alfonso Reyes writer of influential pieces of Mexican surrealism. There is a vibrant tradition of prose poetry in 20th century Latin America; the prose poem becomes a prevalent format for lyrical philosophical inquiry and sensual sentiments of the region's poets. Masters of the prose poem include Jorge Luis Borges (\\"Everything and Nothing\\"), Pablo Neruda (Passions and Impressions), Octavio Paz (Aguila o Sol?/Eagle or Sun?), Alejandra Pizarnik (\\"Sex/Night\\"), and Giannina Braschi (Empire of Dreams). Leaders of the vanguard whose poetry express love, romance, and a commitment to left leaning regional politics are Cesar Vallejo (Peru) and Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda (Chile). Following their lead are Ernesto Cardenal (Nicaragua), Roque Dalton (El Salvador), Nicolás Guillén (Cuba), Gonzalo Rojas (Chile) and Mario Benedetti (Uruguay), and Peruvians Blanca Varela, Jorge Eduardo Eielson or Javier Sologuren. After Modernismo several lesser known, short-lived poetry movements emerged in Latin America. In Chile, Braulio Arenas and others founded in 1938 the Mandrágora group, strongly influenced by Surrealism as well as by Vicente Huidobro's Creacionismo. In Peru, Cesar Moro and Emilio Adolfo Westphalen developed Surrealism in the Andes region. =The Boom= Gabriel García Márquez, the most famous of the Boom writers After World War II, Latin America enjoyed increasing economic prosperity, and a new-found confidence also gave rise to a literary boom. From 1960 to 1967, some of the major seminal works of the boom were published and before long became widely noticed, admired, and commented on beyond Latin America itself. Many of these novels and collections of short stories were somewhat rebellious from the general point of view of Latin America culture. Authors crossed traditional boundaries, experimented with language, and often mixed different styles of writing in their works. Structures of literary works were also changing. Boom writers ventured outside traditional narrative structures, embracing non- linearity and experimental narration. The figure of Jorge Luis Borges, though not a Boom author per se, was extremely influential for the Boom generation. Latin American authors were inspired by North American and European authors such as William Faulkner, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf, by the legendary Spanish poet and dramatist Federico García Lorca as well as by each other's works; many of the authors knew one another, which led to a mutual crossbreeding of styles. The Boom launched Latin American literature onto the world stage. It was distinguished by daring and experimental novels such as Julio Cortázar's Rayuela (1963), that were frequently published in Spanish and quickly translated into English. From 1966 to 1968, Emir Rodríguez Monegal published his influential Latin American literature monthly Mundo Nuevo, with excerpts of unreleased novels from then-new writers such as Guillermo Cabrera Infante or Severo Sarduy, including two chapters of Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad in 1966. In 1967, the published book was one of the Boom's defining novels, which led to the association of Latin American literature with magic realism, though other important writers of the period such as Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes do not fit so easily within this framework. In the same year, 1967. Miguel Ángel Asturias was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, making his magical realist, metaphor-heavy, folkloristic and sometimes politically charged novels widely known in Europe and North America. Perhaps, the Boom's culmination arrived in Augusto Roa Bastos's monumental Yo, el supremo (1974). Other important novelists of the period include the Chilean José Donoso, the Guatemalan Augusto Monterroso and the Cuban Guillermo Cabrera Infante. Though the literary boom occurred while Latin America was having commercial success, the works of this period tended to move away from the positives of the modernization that was underway. Boom works often tended not to focus on social and local issues, but rather on universal and at times metaphysical themes. Political turmoil in Latin American countries such as Cuba at this time influenced the literary boom as well. Some works anticipated an end to the prosperity that was occurring, and even predicted old problems would resurface in the near future. Their works foreshadowed the events to come in the future of Latin America, with the 1970s and 1980s dictatorships, economic turmoil, and Dirty Wars. = Post-Boom and McOndo = Roberto Bolaño is considered to have had the greatest United States impact of any post-Boom author Post-Boom literature is sometimes characterized by a tendency towards irony and humor, as the narrative of Alfredo Bryce Echenique, and towards the use of popular genres, as in the work of Manuel Puig. Some writers felt the success of the Boom to be a burden, and spiritedly denounced the caricature that reduces Latin American literature to magical realism. Hence the Chilean Alberto Fuguet coined McOndo as an antidote to the Macondo-ism that demanded of aspiring writers that they set their tales in steamy tropical jungles in which the fantastic and the real happily coexisted. In a mock diary by post-modernist Giannina Braschi the Narrator of the Latin American Boom is shot by a Macy's make-up artist who accuses the Boom of capitalizing on her solitude. Other writers, however, have traded on the Boom's success: see for instance Laura Esquivel's pastiche of magical realism in Como agua para chocolate. The Spanish language author who has had most impact in United States has been Roberto Bolaño.Roberto Bolaño: diez años sin el autor que conquistó a los jóvenes escritores Overall, contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling Paulo Coelho and Isabel Allende to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as Diamela Eltit, Giannina Braschi, Luisa Valenzuela, Marcos Aguinis, Ricardo Piglia, Roberto Ampuero, Jorge Marchant Lazcano, Alicia Yánez, Jaime Bayly, Alonso Cueto, Edmundo Paz Soldán, Gioconda Belli, Jorge Franco, Daniel Alarcon, Víctor Montoya or Mario Mendoza Zambrano. Other important figures include the Argentine César Aira, the Peruvian-Mexican Mario Bellatin or the Colombian Fernando Vallejo, whose La virgen de los sicarios depicted the violence in Medellín under the influence of the drug trade. Emerging voices include Fernando Ampuero, Miguel Gutierrez, Edgardo Rivera Martinez, Jaime Marchán and Manfredo Kempff. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of testimonio, texts produced in collaboration with subaltern subjects such as Rigoberta Menchú. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic Carlos Monsiváis and Pedro Lemebel, who draw also on the long-standing tradition of essayistic production as well as the precedents of engaged and creative non-fiction represented by the Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano and the Mexican Elena Poniatowska, among others. Prominent 20th century writers Octavio Paz helped to define modern poetry and the Mexican personality. According to literary critic Harold Bloom, the most eminent Latin American author of any century is the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges. In his controversial 1994 book The Western Canon, Bloom says: \\"Of all Latin American authors in this century, he is the most universal... If you read Borges frequently and closely, you become something of a Borgesian, because to read him is to activate an awareness of literature in which he has gone farther than anybody else.\\" The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1994. Among the novelists, perhaps the most prominent author to emerge from Latin America in the 20th century is Gabriel García Márquez. His book Cien Años de Soledad (1967), is one of the most important works in world literature of the 20th century. Borges opined that it was \\"the Don Quixote of Latin America.\\" Jorge Luis Borges: Conversations. Ed. Richard Burgin. Univ of Miss. 1998. Among the greatest poets of the 20th century is Pablo Neruda; according to Gabriel García Márquez, Neruda \\"is the greatest poet of the 20th century, in any language.\\" Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza (1 March 1983). The fragrance of guava: Conversations with Gabriel García Márquez. Verso. p. 49. Retrieved 4 August 2011. Mexican writer and poet Octavio Paz is unique among Latin American writers in having won the Nobel Prize, the Neustadt Prize, and the Cervantes Prize. Paz has also been a recipient of the Jerusalem Prize, as well as an honorary doctorate from Harvard.

Latin American authors who figured in prominent literary critic Harold Bloom's The Western Canon list of the most enduring works of world literature include: Rubén Dário, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Severo Sarduy, Reinaldo Arenas, Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz, César Vallejo, Miguel Ángel Asturias, José Lezama Lima, José Donoso, Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes, and Carlos Drummond de Andrade. Brazilian authors who have won the Camões Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Portuguese language, include: João Cabral de Melo Neto, Rachel de Queiroz, Jorge Amado, Antonio Candido, Autran Dourado, Rubem Fonseca, Lygia Fagundes Telles, João Ubaldo Ribeiro, and Ferreira Gullar. Some notable authors who have won Brazil's Prêmio Machado de Assis include: Rachel de Queiroz, Cecília Meireles, João Guimarães Rosa, Érico Veríssimo, Lúcio Cardoso, and Ferreira Gullar.  Prominent 21st century writers  Latin American literature produced since 2000 spans a wide realm of schools and styles. In the 20th Century, Latin American literary studies was primarily centered around what came before, during, and after The Boom. The scholarly optic has since widened to regularly examine Latin American literature within fields such as the Global South, Postcolonial Literature, Postmodern Literature, Latino philosophy, Electronic Literature, Hysterical Realism, Speculative Fiction, Latinx Pop Culture, Crime Fiction, Horror Fiction, among other fields. Prominent 21st authors whose works are widely available, taught, and translated into many languages include Mario Vargas Llosa, Isabel Allende, Jorge Volpi, Junot Diaz, Giannina Braschi, Elena Poniatowska, Julia Alvarez, Diamela Eltit, and Ricardo Piglia.

(ed)The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 1995. God is usually conceived as being omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all- knowing), omnipresent (all-present) and omnibenevolent (all-good) as well as having an eternal and necessary existence. These attributes are used either in way of analogy or are taken literally. God is most often held to be incorporeal (immaterial).David Bordwell (2002). Catechism of the Catholic Church, Continuum International Publishing p. 84 Incorporeality and corporeality of God are related to conceptions of transcendence (being outside nature) and immanence (being in nature) of God, with positions of synthesis such as the \\"immanent transcendence\\". Some religions describe God without reference to gender, while others use terminology that is gender-specific and . God has been conceived as either personal or impersonal. In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, while in deism, God is the creator, but not the sustainer, of the universe. In pantheism, God is the universe itself. Atheism is an absence of belief in God, while agnosticism deems the existence of God unknown or unknowable. God has also been conceived as the source of all moral obligation, and the \\"greatest conceivable existent\\". Many notable philosophers have developed arguments for and against the existence of God. Monotheistic religions refer to their god using various names, some referring to cultural ideas about their god's identity and attributes. In ancient Egyptian Atenism, possibly the earliest recorded monotheistic religion, this deity was called AtenJan Assmann, Religion and Cultural Memory: Ten Studies, Stanford University Press 2005, p. 59 and proclaimed to be the one \\"true\\" Supreme Being and creator of the universe.M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 2, 1980, p. 96 In the Hebrew Bible and Judaism, the names of God include Elohim, Adonai, YHWH () and others. Yahweh and Jehovah, possible vocalizations of YHWH, are used in Christianity. In the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, one God coexists in three \\"persons\\" called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In Islam, the name Allah is used, while Muslims also use a multitude of titles for God. In Hinduism, Brahman is often considered a monistic concept of God.Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity – p. 136, Michael P. Levine – 2002 In Chinese religion, Shangdi is conceived as the progenitor (first ancestor) of the universe, intrinsic to it and constantly bringing order to it.

The Journal of Hindu Studies, Oxford University Press, Etymology and usage The Mesha Stele bears the earliest known reference (840 BCE) to the Israelite God Yahweh The earliest written form of the Germanic word God comes from the 6th-century Christian Codex Argenteus. The English word itself is derived from the Proto-Germanic * ǥuđan. The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European form was likely based on the root , which meant either \\"to call\\" or \\"to invoke\\".The ulterior etymology is disputed. Apart from the unlikely hypothesis of adoption from a foreign tongue, the OTeut. \\"ghuba\\" implies as its preTeut- type either \\"*ghodho-m\\" or \\"*ghodto-m\\". The former does not appear to admit of explanation; but the latter would represent the neut. pple. of a root \\"gheu-\\". There are two Aryan roots of the required form (\\"*g,heu-\\" with palatal aspirate) one with meaning 'to invoke' (Skr. \\"hu\\") the other 'to pour, to offer sacrifice' (Skr \\"hu\\", Gr. χεηi;ν, OE \\"geotàn\\" Yete v). OED Compact Edition, G, p. 267 The Germanic words for God were originally neuter—applying to both genders—but during the process of the Christianization of the Germanic peoples from their indigenous Germanic paganism, the words became a masculine syntactic form.Barnhart, Robert K. (1995). The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology: the Origins of American English Words, p. 323. HarperCollins. In the English language, capitalization is used for names by which a god is known, including 'God'. Consequently, the capitalized form of god is not used for multiple gods (polytheism) or when used to refer to the generic idea of a deity.Webster's New World Dictionary; \\"God n. ME < OE, akin to Ger gott, Goth guth, prob. < IE base * ĝhau-, to call out to, invoke > Sans havaté, (he) calls upon; 1. any of various beings conceived of as supernatural, immortal, and having special powers over the lives and affairs of people and the course of nature; deity, esp. a male deity: typically considered objects of worship; 2. an image that is worshiped; idol 3. a person or thing deified or excessively honored and admired; 4.

The same holds for Hebrew El, but in Judaism, God is also given a proper name, the tetragrammaton YHWH, in origin possibly the name of an Edomite or Midianite deity, Yahweh. In many English translations of the Bible, when the word LORD is in all capitals, it signifies that the word represents the tetragrammaton. Arabic calligraphy Allāh () is the Arabic term with no plural used by Muslims and Arabic speaking Christians and Jews meaning \\"The God\\", while ʾilāh ( plural \`āliha آلِهَة) is the term used for a deity or a god in general.\\"Islam and Christianity\\", Encyclopedia of Christianity (2001): Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews also refer to God as Allāh. God may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of Hinduism which emphasize the personal nature of God, with early references to his name as Krishna-Vasudeva in Bhagavata or later Vishnu and Hari. Ahura Mazda is the name for God used in Zoroastrianism. \\"Mazda\\", or rather the Avestan stem-form Mazdā-, nominative Mazdå, reflects Proto-Iranian *Mazdāh (female). It is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit, and like its Sanskrit cognate medhā, means \\"intelligence\\" or \\"wisdom\\". Both the Avestan and Sanskrit words reflect Proto-Indo-Iranian *mazdhā-, from Proto-Indo-European mn̩sdʰeh1, literally meaning \\"placing (dʰeh1) one's mind (*mn̩-s)\\", hence \\"wise\\". Waheguru (') is a term most often used in Sikhism to refer to God. It means \\"Wonderful Teacher\\" in the Punjabi language. Vāhi (a Middle Persian borrowing) means \\"wonderful\\" and guru (') is a term denoting \\"teacher\\". Waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions. The most common usage of the word \\"Waheguru\\" is in the greeting Sikhs use with each other: > Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh Wonderful Lord's Khalsa, Victory > is to the Wonderful Lord. Baha, the \\"greatest\\" name for God in the Baháʼí Faith, is Arabic for \\"All- Glorious\\". General conceptions The philosophy of religion recognizes the following as essential attributes of God: * Omnipotence (limitless power) * Omniscience (limitless knowledge) * Eternity (God is not bound by time) * Goodness (God is wholly benevolent) * Unity (God cannot be divided) * Simplicity (God is not composite) * Incorporeality (God is not material) * Immutability (God is not subject to change) * Impassability (God is not affected) There is no clear consensus on the nature or the existence of God. The Abrahamic conceptions of God include the monotheistic definition of God in Judaism, the trinitarian view of Christians, and the Islamic concept of God. There were also various conceptions of God in the ancient Greco-Roman world, such as Aristotle's view of an unmoved mover, the Neoplatonic concept of the One and the pantheistic God of Stoic Physics. The dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine: views of God in Hinduism vary by region, sect, and caste, ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic. Many polytheistic religions share the idea of a creator deity, although having a name other than \\"God\\" and without all of the other roles attributed to a singular God by monotheistic religions. Sikhism is sometimes seen as being pantheistic about God. Śramaṇa religions are generally non-creationist, while also holding that there are divine beings (called Devas in Buddhism and Jainism) of limited power and lifespan. Jainism has generally rejected creationism, holding that soul substances (Jīva) are uncreated and that time is beginningless.Nayanar, Prof. A. Chakravarti (2005). Samayasāra of Ācārya Kundakunda. p.190, Gāthā 10.310, New Delhi: Today & Tomorrows Printer and Publisher. Depending on one's interpretation and tradition, Buddhism can be conceived as being either non- theistic, trans-theistic, pantheistic, or polytheistic. However, Buddhism has generally rejected the specific monotheistic view of a Creator God. The Buddha criticizes the theory of creationism in the early Buddhist texts.Narada Thera (2006) \\"The Buddha and His Teachings,\\" pp. 268-269, Jaico Publishing House.Hayes, Richard P., \\"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\\", Journal of Indian Philosophy, 16:1 (1988:Mar) p. 2. Also, major Indian Buddhist philosophers, such as Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Dharmakirti and Buddhaghosa, consistently critiqued Creator God views put forth by Hindu thinkers.Hsueh-Li Cheng. \\"Nāgārjuna's Approach to the Problem of the Existence of God\\" in Religious Studies, Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1976), pp. 207-216 (10 pages), Cambridge University Press.Hayes, Richard P., \\"Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition\\", Journal of Indian Philosophy, 16:1 (1988:Mar.).Harvey, Peter (2019). \\"Buddhism and Monotheism\\", p. 1. Cambridge University Press. =Oneness= Trinitarians believe that God is composed of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Monotheists believe that there is only one god, and may also believe this god is worshipped in different religions under different names. The view that all theists actually worship the same god, whether they know it or not, is especially emphasized in the Baháʼí Faith, HinduismSee Swami Bhaskarananda, Essentials of Hinduism (Viveka Press 2002) and Sikhism. In Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity describes God as one God in three divine Persons (each of the three Persons is God himself). The Most Holy Trinity comprises God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. In the past centuries, this fundamental mystery of the Christian faith was also summarized by the Latin formula Sancta Trinitas, Unus Deus (Holy Trinity, Unique God), reported in the Litanias Lauretanas. Islam's most fundamental concept is tawhid meaning \\"oneness\\" or \\"uniqueness\\". God is described in the Quran as: \\"He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begetteth not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\\" Muslims repudiate the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus, comparing it to polytheism. In Islam, God is transcendent and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, and are not expected to visualize God. Henotheism is the belief and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities.Müller, Max. (1878) Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion: As Illustrated by the Religions of India. London: Longmans, Green and Co. =Theism, deism, and pantheism= Theism generally holds that God exists realistically, objectively, and independently of human thought; that God created and sustains everything; that God is omnipotent and eternal; and that God is personal and interacting with the universe through, for example, religious experience and the prayers of humans. Theism holds that God is both transcendent and immanent; thus, God is simultaneously infinite and, in some way, present in the affairs of the world. Not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions, but each usually subscribes to some of them (see, by way of comparison, family resemblance). Catholic theology holds that God is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time. Most theists hold that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent, although this belief raises questions about God's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world. Some theists ascribe to God a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence. Open Theism, by contrast, contends that, due to the nature of time, God's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future. Theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods, i.e., monotheism or polytheism. God Blessing the Seventh Day, 1805 watercolor painting by William Blake Deism holds that God is wholly transcendent: God exists, but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it. In this view, God is not anthropomorphic, and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles. Common in Deism is a belief that God has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity. Pandeism combines Deism with Pantheistic beliefs. Pandeism is proposed to explain as to Deism why God would create a universe and then abandon it, and as to Pantheism, the origin and purpose of the universe. Pantheism holds that God is the universe and the universe is God, whereas Panentheism holds that God contains, but is not identical to, the Universe.John Culp (2013). \\"Panentheism,\\" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spring. It is also the view of the Liberal Catholic Church; Theosophy; some views of Hinduism except Vaishnavism, which believes in panentheism; Sikhism; some divisions of Neopaganism and Taoism, along with many varying denominations and individuals within denominations. Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism, paints a pantheistic/panentheistic view of God—which has wide acceptance in Hasidic Judaism, particularly from their founder The Baal Shem Tov—but only as an addition to the Jewish view of a personal god, not in the original pantheistic sense that denies or limits persona to God. =Other concepts= Dystheism, which is related to theodicy, is a form of theism which holds that God is either not wholly good or is fully malevolent as a consequence of the problem of evil. One such example comes from Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, in which Ivan Karamazov rejects God on the grounds that he allows children to suffer.The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky pp. 259–61 In modern times, some more abstract concepts have been developed, such as process theology and open theism. The contemporaneous French philosopher Michel Henry has however proposed a phenomenological approach and definition of God as phenomenological essence of Life. God has also been conceived as being incorporeal (immaterial), a personal being, the source of all moral obligation, and the \\"greatest conceivable existent\\". These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers, including Maimonides, Augustine of Hippo,Edwards, Paul. \\"God and the philosophers\\" in Honderich, Ted. (ed)The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 1995. . and Al- Ghazali,Platinga, Alvin. \\"God, Arguments for the Existence of\\", Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Routledge, 2000. respectively. Non-theistic views Non-theist views about God also vary. Some non-theists avoid the concept of God, whilst accepting that it is significant to many; other non- theists understand God as a symbol of human values and aspirations. The nineteenth-century English atheist Charles Bradlaugh declared that he refused to say \\"There is no God\\", because \\"the word 'God' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct affirmation\\";\\"A Plea for Atheism. By 'Iconoclast, London, Austin & Co., 1876, p. 2. he said more specifically that he disbelieved in the Christian god. Stephen Jay Gould proposed an approach dividing the world of philosophy into what he called \\"non-overlapping magisteria\\" (NOMA). In this view, questions of the supernatural, such as those relating to the existence and nature of God, are non-empirical and are the proper domain of theology. The methods of science should then be used to answer any empirical question about the natural world, and theology should be used to answer questions about ultimate meaning and moral value. In this view, the perceived lack of any empirical footprint from the magisterium of the supernatural onto natural events makes science the sole player in the natural world. Another view, advanced by Richard Dawkins, is that the existence of God is an empirical question, on the grounds that \\"a universe with a god would be a completely different kind of universe from one without, and it would be a scientific difference.\\" Carl Sagan argued that the doctrine of a Creator of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could disprove the existence of a Creator (not necessarily a God) would be the discovery that the universe is infinitely old. Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. =Agnosticism and atheism= Agnosticism is the view that the truth values of certain claims—especially metaphysical and religious claims such as whether God, the divine or the supernatural exist—are unknown and perhaps unknowable. (p. 56 in 1967 edition) Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities.Nielsen 2013: \\"Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons ... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God ... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers ... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., \\"God\\" is just another name for love, or ... a symbolic term for moral ideals.\\"Edwards 2005: \\"On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion.\\" In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities, although it can be defined as a lack of belief in the existence of any deities, rather than a positive belief in the nonexistence of any deities.Rowe 1998: \\"As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God. ... an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology.\\" =Anthropomorphism= Pascal Boyer argues that while there is a wide array of supernatural concepts found around the world, in general, supernatural beings tend to behave much like people. The construction of gods and spirits like persons is one of the best known traits of religion. He cites examples from Greek mythology, which is, in his opinion, more like a modern soap opera than other religious systems. Bertrand du Castel and Timothy Jurgensen demonstrate through formalization that Boyer's explanatory model matches physics' epistemology in positing not directly observable entities as intermediaries. Anthropologist Stewart Guthrie contends that people project human features onto non-human aspects of the world because it makes those aspects more familiar. Sigmund Freud also suggested that god concepts are projections of one's father. Likewise, Émile Durkheim was one of the earliest to suggest that gods represent an extension of human social life to include supernatural beings. In line with this reasoning, psychologist Matt Rossano contends that when humans began living in larger groups, they may have created gods as a means of enforcing morality. In small groups, morality can be enforced by social forces such as gossip or reputation. However, it is much harder to enforce morality using social forces in much larger groups. Rossano indicates that by including ever-watchful gods and spirits, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups. Existence St. Thomas Aquinas summed up five main arguments as proofs for God's existence. Painting by Carlo Crivelli, 1476) Isaac Newton saw the existence of a Creator necessary in the movement of astronomical objects. Painting by Godfrey Kneller, 1689 Arguments about the existence of God typically include empirical, deductive, and inductive types. Different views include that: \\"God does not exist\\" (strong atheism); \\"God almost certainly does not exist\\" (de facto atheism); \\"no one knows whether God exists\\" (agnosticism);Thomas Henry Huxley, an English biologist, was the first to come up with the word agnostic in 1869 However, earlier authors and published works have promoted an agnostic points of view. They include Protagoras, a 5th-century BCE Greek philosopher. \\"God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven\\" (de facto theism); and that \\"God exists and this can be proven\\" (strong theism). Countless arguments have been proposed to prove the existence of God. Some of the most notable arguments are the Five Ways of Aquinas, the Argument from desire proposed by C.S. Lewis, and the Ontological Argument formulated both by St. Anselm and René Descartes. St. Anselm's approach was to define God as, \\"that than which nothing greater can be conceived\\". Famed pantheist philosopher Baruch Spinoza would later carry this idea to its extreme: \\"By God I understand a being absolutely infinite, i.e., a substance consisting of infinite attributes, of which each one expresses an eternal and infinite essence.\\" For Spinoza, the whole of the natural universe is made of one substance, God, or its equivalent, Nature. His proof for the existence of God was a variation of the Ontological argument. Scientist Isaac Newton saw the nontrinitarian God as the masterful creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.Webb, R.K. ed. Knud Haakonssen. \\"The emergence of Rational Dissent.\\" Enlightenment and Religion: Rational Dissent in eighteenth-century Britain. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1996. p19. Nevertheless, he rejected polymath Leibniz' thesis that God would necessarily make a perfect world which requires no intervention from the creator. In Query 31 of the Opticks, Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:St. Thomas believed that the existence of God is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \\"Therefore I say that this proposition, \\"God exists\\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self- evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects.\\" St. Thomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the Summa theologiae and more extensively in the Summa contra Gentiles, he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the quinque viae (Five Ways). # Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a First Mover not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God. # Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a First Cause, called God. # Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist. # Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. This then, we call God (Note: Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself). # Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. This we call God (Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view, the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well).Summa of Theology I, q. 2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence Some theologians, such as the scientist and theologian A.E. McGrath, argue that the existence of God is not a question that can be answered using the scientific method. Agnostic Stephen Jay Gould argues that science and religion are not in conflict and do not overlap. Some findings in the fields of cosmology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience are interpreted by some atheists (including Lawrence M. Krauss and Sam Harris) as evidence that God is an imaginary entity only, with no basis in reality.Krauss L. A Universe from Nothing. Free Press, New York. 2012. Harris, S. The end of faith. W.W. Norton and Company, New York. 2005. These atheists claim that a single, omniscient God who is imagined to have created the universe and is particularly attentive to the lives of humans has been imagined, embellished and promulgated in a trans-generational manner. Richard Dawkins interprets such findings not only as a lack of evidence for the material existence of such a God, but as extensive evidence to the contrary. However, his views are opposed by some theologians and scientists including Alister McGrath, who argues that existence of God is compatible with science., includes sound recording of the Dawkins-McGrath debate Specific attributes Different religious traditions assign differing (though often similar) attributes and characteristics to God, including expansive powers and abilities, psychological characteristics, gender characteristics, and preferred nomenclature. The assignment of these attributes often differs according to the conceptions of God in the culture from which they arise. For example, attributes of God in Christianity, attributes of God in Islam, and the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy in Judaism share certain similarities arising from their common roots. =Names= 99 names of Allah, in Chinese Sini (script) The word God is \\"one of the most complex and difficult in the English language.\\" In the Judeo-Christian tradition, \\"the Bible has been the principal source of the conceptions of God\\". That the Bible \\"includes many different images, concepts, and ways of thinking about\\" God has resulted in perpetual \\"disagreements about how God is to be conceived and understood\\".Francis Schüssler Fiorenza and Gordon D. Kaufman, \\"God\\", Ch 6, in Mark C. Taylor, ed, Critical Terms for Religious Studies (University of Chicago, 1998/2008), 136–40. Many traditions see God as incorporeal and eternal, and regard him as a point of living light like human souls, but without a physical body, as he does not enter the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. God is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues, powers and values and that he is the unconditionally loving Father of all souls, irrespective of their religion, gender, or culture. Throughout the Hebrew and Christian Bibles there are many names for God. One of them is Elohim. Another one is El Shaddai, translated \\"God Almighty\\".Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; Ex. 6:31; Ps. 91:1, 2 A third notable name is El Elyon, which means \\"The High God\\".Gen. 14:19; Ps. 9:2; Dan. 7:18, 22, 25 Also noted in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles is the name \\"I Am that I Am\\".Exodus 3:13-15 God is described and referred in the Quran and hadith by certain names or attributes, the most common being Al-Rahman, meaning \\"Most Compassionate\\" and Al-Rahim, meaning \\"Most Merciful\\" (See Names of God in Islam). Many of these names are also used in the scriptures of the Baháʼí Faith. Vaishnavism, a tradition in Hinduism, has a list of titles and names of Krishna. =Gender= The gender of God may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who, in classical western philosophy, transcends bodily form. Polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender, allowing each to interact with any of the others, and perhaps with humans, sexually. In most monotheistic religions, God has no counterpart with which to relate sexually. Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other. Namely, God is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active (as opposed to the receptive) role in sexual intercourse. Biblical sources usually refer to God using male words, except ,Elaine H. Pagels \\"What Became of God the Mother? Conflicting Images of God in Early Christianity\\" Signs, Vol. 2, No. 2 (Winter, 1976), pp. 293–303 , and (female); , , , , , (a mother); (a mother eagle); and and (a mother hen). =Relationship with creation= And Elohim Created Adam by William Blake, c. 1795 Prayer plays a significant role among many believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship God. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a \\"personal god\\" is integral to the Christian outlook, but that one has to understand it is an analogy. \\"To say that God is like a person is to affirm the divine ability and willingness to relate to others. This does not imply that God is human, or located at a specific point in the universe.\\" Adherents of different religions generally disagree as to how to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement. Jews and Christians believe that humans are created in the image of God, and are the center, crown and key to God's creation, stewards for God, supreme over everything else God had made (); for this reason, humans are in Christianity called the \\"Children of God\\". Depiction =Zoroastrianism= Ahura Mazda (depiction is on the right, with high crown) presents Ardashir I (left) with the ring of kingship. (Relief at Naqsh-e Rustam, 3rd century CE) During the early Parthian Empire, Ahura Mazda was visually represented for worship. This practice ended during the beginning of the Sassanid empire. Zoroastrian iconoclasm, which can be traced to the end of the Parthian period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship. However, Ahura Mazda continued to be symbolized by a dignified male figure, standing or on horseback which is found in Sassanian investiture. =Judaism= At least some Jews do not use any image for God, since God is the unimaginable Being who cannot be represented in material forms. The burning bush that was not consumed by the flames is described in Book of Exodus as a symbolic representation of God when he appeared to Moses.Exodus 3:1–4:5 = Christianity = Early Christians believed that the words of the Gospel of John 1:18: \\"No man has seen God at any time\\" and numerous other statements were meant to apply not only to God, but to all attempts at the depiction of God.James Cornwell, 2009 Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art p. 2 Hand of God in the Ascension from the Drogo Sacramentary, c. 850 However, later depictions of God are found. Some, like the Hand of God, are depiction borrowed from Jewish art. The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of Byzantine iconoclasm (literally image-breaking) started. The Second Council of Nicaea in 787 effectively ended the first period of Byzantine iconoclasm and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.Edward Gibbon, 1995 The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire p. 1693 However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint John of Damascus, drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ. Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to use a human to symbolize God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the image of his own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals). It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure. Typically only a small part would be used as the image, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely a whole human. In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages p. 169 By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French illuminated manuscripts, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in stained glass church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the Baptism of Christ on the famous baptismal font in Liège of Rainer of Huy is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene). Gradually the amount of the human symbol shown can increase to a half- length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in Giotto's fresco of c. 1305 in Padua.Arena Chapel, at the top of the triumphal arch, God sending out the angel of the Annunciation. See Schiller, I, fig 15 In the 14th century the Naples Bible carried a depiction of God the Father in the Burning bush. By the early 15th century, the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry has a considerable number of symbols, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the Garden of Eden, which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress. The \\"Gates of Paradise\\" of the Florence Baptistry by Lorenzo Ghiberti, begun in 1425 use a similar tall full-length symbol for the Father. The Rohan Book of Hours of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer. At the same period other works, like the large Genesis altarpiece by the Hamburg painter Meister Bertram, continued to use the old depiction of Christ as Logos in Genesis scenes. In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ. In an early Venetian school Coronation of the Virgin by Giovanni d'Alemagna and Antonio Vivarini (c. 1443), The Father is depicted using the symbol consistently used by other artists later, namely a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the near-physical, but still figurative, description of the Ancient of Days.Bigham Chapter 7 . ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. (Daniel 7:9) Usage of two Hands of God (relatively unusual) and the Holy Spirit as a dove in Baptism of Christ by Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci, . In the Annunciation by Benvenuto di Giovanni in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the symbolic representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as \\"hands and dove\\" continued, e.g. in Andrea del Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci's Baptism of Christ in .Arthur de Bles, 2004 How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes p. 32 God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing, with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, Girolamo dai Libri, c. 1555 In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father using an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal crown, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book (to symbolize God's knowledge and as a reference to how knowledge is deemed divine). He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the Throne of Mercy iconography. A dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian Pietà, God the Father is often symbolized using a man wearing a papal dress and a papal crown, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They are depicted as floating in heaven with angels who carry the instruments of the Passion.Irene Earls, 1987 Renaissance art: a topical dictionary pp. 8, 283 Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the Jansenist and Baianist movements as well as more orthodox theologians. As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones. In the Western Church, the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image. Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the Trinity were condemned. In 1745 Pope Benedict XIV explicitly supported the Throne of Mercy depiction, referring to the \\"Ancient of Days\\", but in 1786 it was still necessary for Pope Pius VI to issue a papal bull condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.Bigham, 73–76 The famous The Creation of Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, by Michelangelo c. 1512 God the Father is symbolized in several Genesis scenes in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, most famously The Creation of Adam (whose image of near touching hands of God and Adam is iconic of humanity, being a reminder that Man is created in the Image and Likeness of God ()).God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in the Frari of Venice, long admired as a masterpiece of High Renaissance art.Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art p. 222 The Church of the Gesù in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of God the Father. In some of these paintings the Trinity is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but Giovanni Battista Fiammeri also depicted God the Father as a man riding on a cloud, above the scenes.Gauvin Alexander Bailey, 2003 Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome p. 233 In both the Last Judgment and the Coronation of the Virgin paintings by Rubens he depicted God the Father using the image that by then had become widely accepted, a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray. In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists Diego Velázquez (whose father-in-law Francisco Pacheco was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo both depicted God the Father using a patriarchal figure with a white beard in a purple robe. While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the Star Chamber court in England (except the Archbishop of York) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.Charles Winston, 1847 An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England , (2009) p. 229 Later in the 17th century Sir Thomas Browne wrote that he considered the representation of God the Father using an old man \\"a dangerous act\\" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, , 2006 p. 156 In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a \\"Romish trend\\" (a term used to refer to Roman Catholics) that he considered best avoided in England.Charles Winston, 1847 An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England , (2009) p. 230 In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the Great Moscow Council specifically included a ban on a number of symbolic depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,Oleg Tarasov, 2004 Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia p. 185 mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the \\"Ancient of Days\\" was Christ, as Logos, not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as Greece, Romania, and other Orthodox countries. =Islam= The Arabic script of \\"Allah\\" in the Hagia Sophia, Istanbul Muslims believe that God (Allah) is beyond all comprehension and equal, and does not resemble any of his creations in any way. Thus, Muslims are not iconodules, are not expected to visualize God, and instead of having pictures of Allah in their mosques, typically have religious calligraphy written on the wall. =Baháʼí Faith= In the Kitáb-i- Íqán, the primary theological work of the Baháʼí Faith, God is described as “Him Who is the central Orb of the universe, its Essence and ultimate Purpose.” Bahá'u'lláh taught that God is directly unknowable to common mortals, but that his attributes and qualities can be indirectly known by learning from and imitating his divine Manifestations, which in Baháʼí theology are somewhat comparable to Hindu avatars or Abrahamic prophets. These Manifestations are the great prophets and teachers of many of the major religious traditions. These include Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Zoroaster, Muhammad, Bahá'ú'lláh, and others. Although the faith is strictly monotheistic, it also preaches the unity of all religions and focuses on these multiple epiphanies as necessary for meeting the needs of humanity at different points in history and for different cultures, and as part of a scheme of progressive revelation and education of humanity. Theological approaches Classical theists (such as ancient Greco-Medieval philosophers, Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, many Jews and Muslims, and some Protestants) speak of God as a divinely simple 'nothing' that is completely transcendent (totally independent of all else), and having attributes such as immutability, impassibility, and timelessness.1998, God, concepts of, Edward Craig, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Taylor & Francis, Theologians of theistic personalism (the view held by Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, William Lane Craig, and most modern evangelicals) argue that God is most generally the ground of all being, immanent in and transcendent over the whole world of reality, with immanence and transcendence being the contrapletes of personality.www.ditext.com Carl Jung equated religious ideas of God with transcendental metaphors of higher consciousness, in which God can be just as easily be imagined \\"as an eternally flowing current of vital energy that endlessly changes shape ... as an eternally unmoved, unchangeable essence.\\" Many philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God, while attempting to comprehend the precise implications of God's attributes. Reconciling some of those attributes—particularly the attributes of the God of theistic personalism—generated important philosophical problems and debates. For example, God's omniscience may seem to imply that God knows how free agents will choose to act. If God does know this, their ostensible free will might be illusory, or foreknowledge does not imply predestination, and if God does not know it, God may not be omniscient.Wierenga, Edward R. \\"Divine foreknowledge\\" in Audi, Robert. The Cambridge Companion to Philosophy. Cambridge University Press, 2001. The last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the arguments for God's existence raised by such philosophers as Immanuel Kant, David Hume and Antony Flew, although Kant held that the argument from morality was valid. The theist response has been either to contend, as does Alvin Plantinga, that faith is \\"properly basic\\", or to take, as does Richard Swinburne, the evidentialist position. Some theists agree that only some of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that faith is not a product of reason, but requires risk. There would be no risk, they say, if the arguments for God's existence were as solid as the laws of logic, a position summed up by Pascal as \\"the heart has reasons of which reason does not know.\\"Pascal, Blaise. Pensées, 1669.

Goldin, former administrator of NASA under presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Goldin was set to take over the job on November 1, 2003 and be officially inaugurated on November 17, though the deal collapsed in the week leading up to his arrival in Boston. The University eventually terminated Goldin's contract at a cost of $1.8 million, and initiated a second search to fill the presidential position, culminating with the inauguration of Robert A. Brown as the University's 10th president on April 27, 2006. (Aram Chobanian, who had served as president ad interim during most of the second search, was recognized by the Board as the 9th president in 2005.) Fall of Jon Westling Jon Westling took office as Boston University's 8th president in 1996, succeeding the controversial John Silber, who had served in the office for 25 years. Despite Westling's lack of a PhD, he was Silber's recommendation to the Trustees for the job.Rimer, Sara. \\"Turmoil at the Top at Boston University.\\" The New York Times October 28, 2003, Late ed., sec. A: 16. LexisNexis Academic. Boston, MA. May 6, 2006. In 2002, after six years in office, the Trustees forced Westling to resign (presumably at the behest of Silber, who had \\"soured\\" on him). Silber stepped in to take over presidential duties until a suitable candidate could be found. Selection process According to sources the selection process was hurried for a number of reasons. Most notably, Silber had an intense desire to retire permanently, and his critics on the Board of Trustees (led by Jeffrey Katzenberg) similarly wanted to see his influence within the university diminished or eliminated altogether. This emphasis on expeditiousness, combined with the highly unusual presence of Silber in candidate interviews (and on the selection committee in general) caused some Trustees to feel they were not at liberty to voice their concerns.Bombardieri, Marcella, and Patrick Healy. \\"GOLDIN's 'HIT LIST' STUNNED TRUSTEES.\\" The Boston Globe November 2, 2003, Third ed., sec. A: 1. LexisNexis Academic. Boston, MA. May 6, 2006. This led to sloppiness in the interviews and contract negotiations. After only one interview, Goldin was catapulted to the top of the committee's list, due mostly to the personal backing of Silber. Goldin remained the favorite even after he made demands during contract negotiations that would have likely disqualified him from consideration in more ideal circumstances. Among these was his desire to spend much of his time in Malibu, California, where his wife would be living; according to a source Goldin \\"didn't think he had to be on campus every weekend to be effective.\\" The Trustees agreed to this, and even offered to subsidize this travel with first class airfare as well as a private jet named “BU1”. Tolerance of such requests was reinforced by the hope that Goldin would use the influence from his former association with NASA to draw in more research funding and grants. Despite some Trustees' uneasiness over offering Goldin the position, enough votes existed to do so. As a sign of support, the chairman of the board requested that the vote be unanimous. The Trustees capitulated, unanimously deciding in favor of extending Goldin the job offer. Vote of no confidence On October 24, a mere week prior to Goldin's arrival on campus, the Trustees gave him a vote of no confidence, and called an emergency meeting to address the matter on October 31. Initial reports as to the reason for this vote were numerous, but mostly implicated Silber's reputation as a man reluctant to relinquish authority. Goldin reportedly had upset Silber loyalists on the Board by \\"slighting\\" Silber with his insistence that he would have no hand in university affairs after his departure. One report even alleged that Goldin had retained a psychiatrist to evaluate Silber in hopes of committing him and minimizing his influence.Rimer, Sara. \\"Boston U. Pays Leader to Quit Before Starting.\\" The New York Times November 1, 2003, Late ed., sec. A: 1. LexisNexis Academic. Boston, MA. May 6, 2006. The Boston Globe has since reported that Goldin had been planning a purge of BU's upper administration, and had already determined in detail who he thought should remain and who should not. Goldin apparently had intentions to clean house; his plans included the sacking of most of the University's top administrators. The most notable of these were Provost Dennis Berkey and Treasurer Kenneth Condon, both of whom were also finalists for the presidency. This spooked the Trustees, and to a large degree precipitated the no confidence vote. =Columbia accident investigation report= While unclear how much it may have weighed on the Trustees, in August 2003 NASA's Columbia Accident Investigation Board released Volume I of its report on the causes of the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia the previous February. This report did not cast Goldin's time at NASA in a flattering light. The report said that \\"Goldin engineered 'not one or two policy changes, but a torrent of changes. This was not evolutionary change, but radical or discontinuous change,'\\" and described his tenure as \\"one of continuous turmoil.\\"Columbia Accident Investiagation Board Report Volume I. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 2003. 105. May 6, 2006 . Termination of contract Goldin caught wind of the vote, and in a memorandum to the Board dated October 27 apologized \\"if he had unintentionally offended any trustees in discussions over terms of the job.\\" However, he also reiterated his conditions that Silber not remain as Chancellor or member of the Board of Trustees, saying \\"there can only be one president\\", and reminding the Board of their contract.Rimer, Sara. \\"As Trustees Waver, Choice to Lead University Vows a Fight.\\" The New York Times October 29, 2003, Late ed., sec. A: 14. LexisNexis Academic. Boston, MA. May 6, 2006. A settlement was eventually reached between the University and Goldin, the details of which were never released but which sources have indicated included a $1.8 million payment to Goldin, in exchange for his abandoning any claims he may have had against BU. Aram Chobanian, Dean of Boston University School of Medicine, was named President Ad interim until a new president could be found. Aftermath In the wake of this fiasco, the end of which left BU $1.8 million poorer and saw its reputation in the academic world badly damaged, several actions were taken to improve the image projected to potential presidential candidates, as well as the functioning of the Board itself. In a mostly symbolic but still very important gesture, the Board requested that Silber vacate his offices in the university's administrative suites at Sherborn Street. It was hoped this would eliminate any concern on the part of candidates that their authority would be undermined.Rimer, Sara. \\"Boston U. Trustees Regrouping After Turmoil Over Presidency.\\" The New York Times April 16, 2004, Late ed., sec. A: 16. LexisNexis Academic. Boston, MA. May 6, 2006. The Board also accepted the resignations of its chairman and vice-chairman, Christopher Barreca and Dexter Dodge. This, along with proposed checks on Trustee actions such as term limits and plans for an independent oversight body, has signaled an improvement in the management of BU. Dan Goldin Day Upon the announcement of Goldin's appointment the Trustees cancelled classes across the University and planned a celebratory parade, complete with campus police honor guard, for Goldin's inauguration on November 17. After the vote of no confidence, and Goldin's subsequent withdrawal the Trustees decided to uphold their decision and did not reinstate classes, though they did cancel the parade.

As chairman of the Israeli branch of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), Hermesh is also a member of the WJC Executive Committee. Biography Born in Tel Aviv in 1944, Hermesh spent his military service in the Nahal and the paratroop brigade. With the conclusion of his military service in 1965, he became a member of kibbutz Kfar Aza, situated on the Gaza Strip border. A year later, in the Six-Day War, Hermesh served as a combat soldier in the paratroop brigade, under the command of colonel Motta Gur in the battle to capture Jerusalem. From 1967 to 1972 Hermesh studied economics and sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, gaining a BA, and later acquired an MBA from the same university. During his studies, he was community manager in his kibbutz as well as a member of the United Kibbutz Movement secretariat. In the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Hermesh was a combat soldier in the paratroop force that crossed the Suez Canal under the command of General Ariel Sharon. After the conflict, Hermesh served as the economics manager of Kfar Aza for three years, followed by another five years as the finance director of Kafrit, a company producing raw material for the plastics industry. At the end of his term of office, he embarked on studies towards a doctorate in the history of the Jewish People in the modern era. In 1987, after two years during which he was responsible for growing and marketing agricultural produce for export from the Negev farms, Hermesh was elected mayor of the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council, a position which he retained until 2003. During his time as mayor the council won the Gold Prize for excellence in financial management for six consecutive years,Shai Hermesh: Public Activities Knesset website which led to him being given the Knight of Quality Government Award. Hermesh also held the position of Chairman of the Executive Committee of Sapir Academic College in Sderot. At the same time, he served as a member of the forum of the Broadcasting National Authority and on the National Parks authority, as well as helping to establish Ibim, a new village in the Negev for students during the post–1990 mass immigration from the Former Soviet Union. Before the 2006 elections Hermesh left the Labor Party in which he had been active for forty years and joined the new Kadima party. Even before, as a treasurer of the Jewish Agency, he collaborated with Sharon and played a crucial part in defeating the candidacy of Natan Sharansky to the post of the Chairman of the Jewish Agency, which went to Sharon's ally Zeev Bielsky instead. He won 30th place on the party's Knesset list, but narrowly missed out on winning a seat as the party picked up only 29 mandates. However, Kadima MK Uriel Reichman resigned almost immediately after the election after he was not given the Education ministry portfolio he had been promised before the elections (it went to Labor's Yuli Tamir instead). As the next placed candidate on the party's list, Hermesh replaced him in the Knesset.

Raised in the rural, patois (Creole)Kwéyòl-speaking part of St Lucia, whose customs of flower festivals and séances, were both frowned upon and prohibited by the British elites who governed the island, Sesenne learned to embrace her culture and celebrate its African tradition. She began her schooling at the Patience School but did not complete her primary education, after unfounded gossip by the school principal made her fear for her reputation. Career At the age of eight, Sesenne was chosen to be the lead singer, or chantwelle, of a La Rose group in the Micoud area begun by her father. At the time, her father held the title \\"La Rose King\\", and her mother served among his followers as \\"queen\\". Sesenne became a locally renowned singer of traditional Saint Lucian music, with a unique voice, which could be recognized even within a large group of other singers. Besides singing, she was an accomplished dancer of many styles, including the bakalow, belair, la commette, chalstan, débot, konte, kontwidance, mapa, mazouk, meina, quadrille and ring games. Sesenne's vocal ability allowed her to sing \\"seven different pitches in synchrony\\", by touching her throat to change the pitch. She also had an instinctive ability to improvise for dramatic effect which allowed her to discover chords and rhythm which amplified her performances. Sesenne was widely recognized in her rural area, winning many competitions and prizes. Sesenne's skill with kont brought her to the attention of Grace Augustin, a planter and entrepreneur who owned guest house called The Hotel on the roadway between Micoud and Castries. Augustin hired Sesenne as the principal performer of a band which entertained guests with the use of such traditional instruments as the banjo, chak-chak, guitar, mandolin, quatro and violin. Augustin introduced Sesenne to other hoteliers increasing her reputation, which soon piqued the interest of Harold Simmons, a local cultural advocate. Simmons sent an associate to find Sesenne and convince her of the need to record her music. When she somewhat hesitantly consented, Simmons introduced her to Daniel J. Crowley, an American anthropologist interested in preserving Caribbean folk music. Once the recordings were completed, the music began airing on local radio and propelled Sesenne to even greater fame. The recording initiative, convinced the government to send Sesenne as one of the performers in the regional CARIFTA Expo '69, (precursor event to the Caribbean Festival of Arts) to be held in Grenada, where she won the event with her rendition of the song \\"Wai\\" (\\"Why\\"). Her performance was sung entirely in Kwéyòl and energized the audience with numerous standing ovations. In 1983, plans began for a Jounen Kwéyòl (Creole Day) to mark the importance of the Kwéyòl(Creole) language in St. Lucia and press for its official recognition. Fifteen hours of radio programming, including music, news and poetry performed in(Creole) Kwéyòl, were broadcast by Radio Saint Lucia. The following year, Sesenne opened the festivities, which not only featured broadcasting, but included live performances of dancers, musicians and singers, as well as literature written promoting the language. Later that year, in October, Sesenne was crowned with the title \\"Queen of Culture in St. Lucia\\" at a ceremony held with family and friends in the Catholic Church in Mon Repos. The Department of Culture produced an audio cassette with the help of guitarist Ronald \\"Boo\\" Hinkson in the 1980s of Sesenne's music. In 1987, Sesenne was honored on International Women's Day by the Ministry for Women's Affairs. Her only album was produced in conjunction with a UNESCO project in 1991. Sesenne married Tennyson Descartes, a labourer of Micoud and the couple had seven children: five boys and two girls. They made their home in Mon Repos, La Pointe. At the time of her death, Sesenne had 34 grandchildren and 38 great-grandchildren. Death and legacy When Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott wrote \\"my country heart, I am not home till Sesenne sings, a voice with wood smoke and ground-doves in it…\\" in his poem \\"Homecoming\\", Sesenne was immortalized. In 2000, Sesenne was awarded the distinction of Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her community service and cultural preservation efforts. Soon thereafter, the government of St. Lucia built a new home for Sesenne in the Patience community of Micoud. The plans included an initiative for the home to later be converted into the \\"Sesenne Descartes Folk Heritage Museum\\", as a repository to preserve the folk heritage of the island. In 2005, the Folk Research Centre designated her as a National Cultural Hero. Sesenne died on 11 August 2010 in Mon Repos, Saint Lucia, at the age of 96. She was given a state funeral on 28 August 2010 at the St. Lucy's Catholic Church of Micoud. Plans were made to revisit the conversion of her home into a museum and to initiate a program to digitize the works of Sesenne. At her funeral, Prime Minister Stephenson King announced the creation of the \\"Dame Sesenne Descartes National Endowment for Creative Industries\\" to promote growth and development of cultural endeavors. In 2014, a biography of Sesenne was included in A. L. Dawn French's book, Profile: Cultural Heroes of Saint Lucia, volume 18 of a series produced by the Folk Research Centre.

According to Breillat, Anatomy of Hell is a \\"sequel\\" to Romance. Plot Teetering on the edge of overwhelming ennui, a lonely and dejected woman pays a gay man to join her for a daring, four-day exploration of sexuality in which both reject all convention and smash all boundaries while locked away from society in an isolated estate. Only when the man and woman confront the most unspeakable aspects of their sexuality will they have a pure understanding of how the sexes view one another. Cast * Amira Casar as the woman * Rocco Siffredi as the man * Catherine Breillat as the narrator * Alexandre Belin as Blow-job lover 1 * Manuel Taglang as Blow-job lover 2 * Jacques Monge as Man in bar * Claudio Carvalho as Boy with the Bird * Carolina Lopes as Little Girl * Diego Rodrigues (billed as 'Diogo Rodriques') as Little boy playing doctor * João Marques as Boy Playing Doctor * Bruno Fernandes as Little boy playing doctor * Maria Edite Moreira as Pharmacist 1 * Maria João Santos as Pharmacist 2 Production The film was adapted by writer/director Breillat from her novel Pornocracy. The sexually explicit film stars Amira Casar as \\"the woman\\" and porn star Rocco Siffredi as \\"the man\\". Leonard Maltin summarizes: \\"After attempting suicide in the bathroom of a gay disco, a woman hires the man who rescues her to spend four nights in her company, challenging him to 'watch me where I'm unwatchable'.\\" Reception The film polarized critics. Leonard Maltin gave the film zero stars and said the film was \\"homophobic\\" and \\"unintentionally funny\\".Maltin, Leonard. Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide, p. 41 Roger Ebert stated: \\"I remember when hard-core first became commonplace, and there were discussions about what it would be like if a serious director ever made a porn movie. The answer, judging by Anatomy of Hell, is that the audience would decide they did not require such a serious director after all.\\" BBC film critic Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five: : \\"The plot is hardcore thin: a woman (Amira Casar) cruises a gay club and pays broody stud (porn star Rocco Siffredi) to spend four nights with her. A challengingly explicit delve into the female body (often quite literally), it's a unique cinematic example of feminist existential porn.... Yet perversely, it's also one of the most groundbreaking films in recent memory in terms of both the explicitness of its sexuality and its commitment to such an austere intellectual discourse. No wonder Rocco looks so shell-shocked: this is sex not as comedy, but as the deepest, darkest male nightmare.\\"Russell, Jamie. BBC Movies review of Anatomy of Hell, BBC, 22 November 2004 The film went on to win \\"Best Feature Film\\" at the Philadelphia Film Festival.Philadelphia Film Festival, Date: April 8 - April 21 2004 Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 26% rating based on 35 critics with an average rating of 3.56/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Ponderous, pretentious, and  considering the subject matter  dull.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 29 out of 100 rating based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".

He specialized in sublime effigies of painted figures. His establishment of a school of painting gives him a great influence on Polish art. Life and professional career Initially trained by the court painter of Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński, in 1711 he went to Rome, where was admitted to Accademia di San Luca. His tutor was Benedetto Luti. During his apprenticeship in Rome he practiced copying works of famous artists, such as Raphael (designs of tapestries), Guido Reni (Crucifixion, today in the St. Stanisław's Church in Rome; Massacre of the Innocents, Lviv Gallery of Art), Peter Paul Rubens (Christ among the Pharisees), Federico Barocci (Deposition, Lviv Gallery of Art). In 1716 he was awarded by the Accademia for two of his drawings, Samson vanquishing the lion and Victorious return from the expedition. While still in Rome he painted some altar paintings for churches in Poland – Vision of St. Anthony, The Descent from the Cross, Protection of the Mother of God over Kraków for the Piarists Church in Kraków (1729) and Assumption of the Virgin Mary for the Cathedral in Kielce (1730). The Entombment, before 1731 In 1731 he went back to Poland, where in Warsaw he competed with Johann Samuel Mock to get the position of court painter of Augustus II the Strong. Shortly afterward he became a renowned portrait and religious painter. Among his clients were Polish and Lithuanian magnates and powerful clergymen – Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński, Grand Treasurer of the Crown (between 1731–34 he painted his portrait, today in the Armoury of the Castle in Liw), Jan Aleksander Lipski, Bishop of Kraków, Jan Fryderyk Sapieha, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania (in about 1740 he painted his portrait, today in the Lithuanian Art Museum in Vilnius, and at his initiative some religious paintings for St. Anne's Church and SS. Peter and Paul's Church in Kraków in 1741), Jan Tarło, voivode of Sandomierz (after 1743 paintings intended for parish church in Opole Lubelskie), Sułkowski family (paintings for the City Church in Leszno), Jan Klemens Branicki, Grand Crown Hetman (in 1750 he made 7 paintings for the parish church in Tykocin, and in 1760 two more for parish church in Tyczyn), Wacław Rzewuski, Grand Crown Hetman (between 1762–67 paintings for the castle chapel in Pidhirtsi). In his portraits he was influenced by the Sarmatian portrait, though he put emphasis on the psychology of his subject. He worked in Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Pidhirtsi, Polotsk and Vilnius. From about 1750, he used delicate colours closely related with rococo. Czechowicz established his own school of painting, where he taught free of charge. Some of his paintings were probably accomplished by his pupils – Franciszek Smuglewicz, Tadeusz Konicz, Jan Ścisło, Jan Bogumił Plersch and Antoni Albertrandi. In his religious paintings he followed the patterns of the mature Roman Baroque, especially Carlo Maratta, Benedetto Luti and Sebastiano Conca, while his portraits were inspired by Saxon school of portrait. Czechowicz died in 1775 in Warsaw and was buried in the Capucine Church.

All the villagers feel happy over welcoming him back to the village. Dhanasekar decides to build a new bungalow adjacent to his ancestral home in the village and plans to live there. He approaches Tamizharasan aka Tamizh (Arun Vijay), an architect to design his new home. Tamizh’s father (Vijayakumar) is also an architect who is famous for traditional architectural designs. Dhanasekar and his family temporarily stay in his neighbor’s house until the construction of new house is completed. Tamizh also stays in a tent near the construction site managing the construction activities. Vinu Chakravarthy lives in the same village and he hates Dhanasekar and his family. He wants them to be killed and sends his son Mukesh Tiwari to work with the construction workers so that he can get them killed someday. Jeeva (Shamitha) is Dhanasekar's niece and she befriends Tamizh. Tamizh also likes Jeeva and slowly friendship transforms into love for Tamizh. When Tamizh proposes his love to Jeeva, she leaves the place without replying which makes Tamizh understand that she does not have any feelings for him. One day, a family comes to Dhanasekar’s house expressing interest to get Jeeva married to their son. But Dhanasekar informs them that Jeeva will be married to his brother Ranjith who is in jail for 12 years. Tamizh gets shocked knowing about this and he gets angry that the family is planning to sacrifice Jeeva by getting her married to someone who has been jailed for years. Dhanasekar comes to know about the love between Jeeva and Tamizh. He calls Tamizh and tells a flashback about his family. Dhanasekar was leading a joyful life in the same village along with his brothers Chandrsekhar and Ranjith, sisters Kavitha and Thamarai (also Shamitha), and mother Manorama. Vinu Chakravarthy does not like Dhanasekar’s family and always picks up quarrels with them.

Dhanasekar and his family members leave the village and move to Tirupur where they earn well and the family comes back to the same village after 12 years. But they are worried that Ranjith’s life will be spoiled as no girl will be interested to marry him as he has been jailed. So they decide to get Jeeva married to him. Jeeva though not interested in the proposal, agrees to marry her uncle Ranjith for the well-being of her family. Tamizh understands the family’s situation and decides to give up his love for Jeeva. But on the other hand, Jeeva decides to express her interest in marrying Tamizh. She meets Tamizh and conveys her love. But Tamizh says that he came to know about her family’s past and he also felt proud about Jeeva’s decision to sacrifice her life for the happiness of her family. He apologizes to Jeeva for confusing her predetermined mind in the name of love and he also requests her to marry Ranjith who is about to get released from jail soon. The new home is completed and Mukesh Tiwari plants a bomb in the home, so that everyone can be killed as well as the home can be destroyed. Tamizh gets to know about Mukesh Tiwari’s plans and he alerts everyone. Also, Tamizh rushes into the house in search of the bomb and finds it after much struggle. He takes the bomb and throws it away before it could explode thereby saving all the family members and also the newly built home. The entire family thanks Tamizh for his help. Tamizh leaves to his home on the next day. After a few days, Dhanasekar comes along with his brothers Chandrasekhar and Ranjith, after getting released from jail to meet Tamizh and his father Vijayakumar inviting them for the house warming ceremony as well as for Jeeva’s wedding. On seeing the invitation card, Tamizh gets surprised to see his name as groom for Jeeva. A flashback is shown where Ranjith after getting released from jail comes to meet his family. They share some good moments as he meets his family members after a period of 12 years as he never allowed anyone to meet him in jail except Dhanasekar. Ranjith is surprised on seeing Jeeva as she exactly resembles his sister Thamarai in looks. Ranjith also believes that Thamarai has reborn in the form of Jeeva and feels happy that he got back his lovable sister whom he killed out of anger. So he wants to ensure that Jeeva is happily married and her husband is chosen with her consent. Also, Ranjith says that he does not want to marry any one and instead he prefers to stay single along with all the family members. Coming to know about the love of Jeeva and Thamizh, the family members then decide to get Jeeva married to Tamizh. The movie ends with Tamizh and Jeeva getting united.

The area was likely named for Roxburghshire, Scotland, the ancestral home of Andrew Robeson, one of the earliest settlers of the area. History The Native American trail called the Manatawny, now Ridge Avenue, was central to the well-organized development of farms and plantations within the area then known as Manatawna. The Court of Upland in England appointed local Swedish settler Peter Rambo to be the maintainer of the Manatawny road. In 1690, the road was renamed Ridge Road (it follows the crest of the ridge between the Wissahickon valley and the Schuylkill valley), and the area was renamed Roxburgh. By 1707, the name had been changed to Roxborough. Roxborough is first mentioned as a township in QS Road Docket II: 31 in 1706.

Cochliomyia hominivorax, the New World screw- worm fly, or screw-worm for short, is a species of parasitic fly that is well known for the way in which its larvae (maggots) eat the living tissue of warm- blooded animals. It is present in the New World tropics. There are five species of Cochliomyia but only one species of screw-worm fly in the genus; there is also a single Old World species in a different genus (Chrysomya bezziana). Infestation of a live vertebrate animal by a maggot is technically called myiasis. While the maggots of many fly species eat dead flesh, and may occasionally infest an old and putrid wound, screw-worm maggots are unusual because they attack healthy tissue. Lifecycle Screw-worm females lay 250–500 eggs in the exposed flesh of warm-blooded animals, including humans, such as in wounds and the navels of newborn animals. The larvae hatch and burrow into the surrounding tissue as they feed. Should the wound be disturbed during this time, the larvae burrow or \\"screw\\" deeper into the flesh, thus the insect's name. The maggots are capable of causing severe tissue damage or even death to the host. About three to seven days after hatching, the larvae fall to the ground to pupate. The pupae reach the adult stage about seven days later. Female screw-worm flies mate four to five days after hatching. The entire lifecycle is around 20 days. A female can lay up to 3,000 eggs and fly up to during her life. Control The United States officially eradicated the screw-worm in 1982 using the sterile insect technique. However, a 2016 outbreak occurred in Monroe County, Florida. The screw-worm was eradicated in Guatemala and Belize in 1994, El Salvador in 1995, and Honduras in 1996. Campaigns against the flies continue in Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and Jamaica with financial assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture, which tries to push back the parasite beyond the narrow and easily controlled Isthmus of Panama. Etymology From the Greek kochlias (snail with a spiral shell) + myia (fly) and the Latin hominis (man) + vorax (consuming), Cochliomyia hominivorax, or the New World screw-worm fly (formerly Callitroga (Greek kallos, (beautiful), + trogein, (to gnaw), americana), was first described by French entomologist Charles Coquerel in 1858.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching , is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Various indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster of 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament. Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition, with a monarch and a prime minister who serves as the chair of the Cabinet and head of government. The country is a realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie and officially bilingual at the federal level. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture. As a developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally as well as the thirteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Etymology While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada, the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word , meaning \\"village\\" or \\"settlement\\". In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona. Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada. From the 16th to the early 18th century \\"Canada\\" referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named the Canadas; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841. Upon Confederation in 1867, Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference, and the word Dominion was conferred as the country's title. By the 1950s, the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \\"Realm of the Commonwealth\\". The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.Bowden, J.W.J.. (2015). Dominion': A Lament. The Dorchester Review 5, no. 2: pp.58-64. In 1982, the passage of the Canada Act, bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control, referred only to Canada, while later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day. The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the Second World War the term federal had replaced dominion. History =Indigenous peoples= Linguistic areas of North American Indigenous peoples at the time of European contact Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis, the last being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity. The term Aboriginal as a collective noun is a specific term of art used in some legal documents, including the Constitution Act 1982. The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 14,000 years ago. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations. The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency. Although not without conflict, European Canadians' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and Indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008. =European colonization= A reconstruction of Norse buildings at the UNESCO listed L'Anse aux Meadows site in Newfoundland, Canada. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that iron working, carpentry, and boat repair were conducted at the site. It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson. In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland. No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada's Atlantic coast in the name of King Henry VII of England. In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where, on July 24, he planted a cross bearing the words \\"Long Live the King of France\\" and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I. The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast. In general, early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia. In 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, founded St. John's, Newfoundland, as the first North American English colony. French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal (in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608). Among the colonists of New France, Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day Maritimes, while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana. The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade. Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec. The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland, beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after. A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War. Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights, created the Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution. After the successful American War of Independence, the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace, ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country. The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories. New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of Saint John, New Brunswick to become Canada's first city. To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later Quebec) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later Ontario), granting each its own elected legislative assembly. War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed. Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850. New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances. Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891. The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). The Alaska Purchase of 1867 by the United States established the border along the Pacific coast, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–BC border for years to come. =Confederation and expansion= the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories since Confederation in 1867 Following several constitutional conferences, the Constitution Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Canada assumed control of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories, where the Métis' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had been united in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871, while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873. In 1898, during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories, parliament created the Yukon Territory. Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905. Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated southwards, to the U.S. To open the West and encourage European immigration, Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the Canadian Pacific Railway), opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act, and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory. This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to \\"Indian reserves\\", clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements. This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land. The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves. During this time, Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights. =Early 20th century= Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the Constitution Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Canada into World War I. Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps, which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war. Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers. The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party. In 1919, Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain, and the 1931 Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada's independence. Canadian crew of a Sherman tank, south of Vaucelles, France, during the Battle of Normandy in June 1944 The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence. The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded. Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid, the Allied invasion of Italy, the Normandy landings, the Battle of Normandy, and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944. Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany. The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy. =Contemporary era= The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor. After two bitter referendums, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province. Governor General the Viscount Alexander of Tunis (centre) receiving the bill finalizing the union of Newfoundland and Canada on March 31, 1949, at Rideau Hall Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity, marked by the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions. Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the UK's Canada Act 1982, the patriation of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country, although the Queen retained her role as monarch of Canada. In 1999, Nunavut became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government. At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular nationalist movement. The radical Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the Parti Québécois was elected in 1976, organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990. This led to the formation of the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West. A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation. In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history; the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; and the Oka Crisis of 1990, the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups. Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United States–led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia. Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in 2001, but declined to join the United States–led invasion of Iraq in 2003. In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War, and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s. Geography, climate, and environment By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes. Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories, eight share a border with the United States, and only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan), with the remaining eight provinces and three territories directly bordering one of three oceans. Ontario and Quebec also send most of their shipping traffic through the St. Lawrence Seaway, which connects the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of , and occupies much of the continent of North America. Moreover, Canada's border with the contiguous United States to the south and the U.S. state of Alaska to the northwest forms the longest international land border in the world, stretching . In addition to the U.S., Canada shares a maritime boundary with Greenland to the northeast and with the France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast. Köppen climate types of Canada Canada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies from the North Pole. Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Canadian Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change. Three of Canada's arctic islandsBaffin Island, Victoria Island and Ellesmere Islandare among the ten largest in the world. Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield; 42 percent of the land acreage is covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land), made up mostly of spruce, poplar, and pine. Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are greater than —which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water. There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera. Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley massif, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. The volcanic eruption of the Tseax Cone in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 Nisga'a people and destroying their village in the Nass River valley of northern British Columbia. The eruption produced a lava flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River. Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near , but can drop below with severe wind chills. In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from , with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding . Government and politics Parliament Hill, home of the federal government in Canada's capital city, Ottawa Canada is described as a \\"full democracy\\", with a tradition of liberalism, and an egalitarian, moderate political ideology. An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture. Peace, order, and good government, alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian government. At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practicing \\"brokerage politics\\", the centre-left Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right Conservative Party of Canada (or its predecessors). The historically predominant Liberal Party position themselves at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum, with the Conservative Party positioned on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left. Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2019 election—the Liberal Party, who currently form the government; the Conservative Party, who are the official opposition; the New Democratic Party; the Bloc Québécois; and the Green Party of Canada. Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy—the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The reigning monarch is Queen Elizabeth II, who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada's 10 provinces. The person who is the Canadian monarch is the same as the British monarch, although the two institutions are separate. The Queen appoints a representative, the governor general (at present Julie Payette), to carry out most of her federal royal duties in Canada. The direct participation of the monarch and the governor general in areas of governance is limited. In practice, their use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet, a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons of Canada and chosen and headed by the prime minister (at present Justin Trudeau), the head of government. The governor general or monarch may, though, in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, lieutenant governors, senators, federal court judges, and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies. The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check. Senate chamber within the Centre Block on Parliament Hill Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either on the advice of the prime minister or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Canada's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts. The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country. In addition, the minister of finance and minister of industry utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development. The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Canadian bank notes. The bank does not issue Canadian coins; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint. =Law= The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country, and consists of written text and unwritten conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 (known as the British North America Act prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments. The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act, 1982, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government—though a notwithstanding clause allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years. The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill Canada's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since December 18, 2017 by Chief Justice Richard Wagner. Its nine members are appointed by the Governor- General on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice. All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies. The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec, where civil law predominates. Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada. Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces. However, in most rural areas and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada. Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples. Most notably, a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921. These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Crown-in-Council with the duty to consult and accommodate. The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. These rights may include provision of services, such as health care through the Indian Health Transfer Policy, and exemption from taxation. =Foreign relations and military= The Canadian delegation to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, May 1945 Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral solutions. Canada's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations, and through the work of numerous federal institutions. Canada's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image. The strategy of the Canadian government's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals, while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises. Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization, the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs. Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976. Canada joined the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). Canada and the United States share the world's longest undefended border, co-operate on military campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations with Cuba, and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II. Canada's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. During the Cold War, Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in cooperation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union. A Canadian CF-18 Hornet in Cold Lake, Alberta. CF-18s have supported NORAD air sovereignty patrols and participated in combat during the Gulf War and the Kosovo and Bosnia crisis. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as the inventor of the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair. In 2001, Canada deployed troops to Afghanistan as part of the U.S. stabilization force and the UN-authorized, NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. In February 2007, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Russia announced their joint commitment to a $1.5-billion project to help develop vaccines for developing nations, and called on other countries to join them. In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925. In September 2020, Canada joined the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) program, which aims to ensure equal access to a potential COVID-19 vaccine for all member countries and to help lower-income countries secure doses. The nation employs a professional, volunteer military force of approximately 79,000 active personnel and 32,250 reserve personnel. The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force. In 2013, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately , or around one percent of the country's GDP. Following the 2016 Defense Policy Review, called \\"Strong, Secure, Engaged\\", the Canadian government announced a 70 percent increase to the country's defence budget over the next decade. The Canadian Forces will acquire 88 fighter planes and 15 naval surface combatants based on the Type 26 frigate design, the latter as part of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach by 2027. Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas, including in Iraq, Ukraine, and the Caribbean Sea. =Provinces and territories= link=Provinces and territories of Canada Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces. The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the Constitution Act, 1867, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the Government of Canada (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a constitutional amendment, whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government. Economy Canada is the world's tenth-largest economy , with a nominal GDP of approximately US$1.73 trillion. It is one of the least corrupt countries in the world, and is one of the world's top ten trading nations, with a highly globalized economy. Canada has a mixed economy ranking above the U.S. and most western European nations on The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, and experiencing a relatively low level of income disparity. The country's average household disposable income per capita is \\"well above\\" the OECD average. The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, listing over 1,500 companies with a combined market capitalization of over US$2 trillion. In 2018, Canadian trade in goods and services reached trillion. Canada's exports totalled over billion, while its imported goods were worth over billion, of which approximately billion originated from the United States, billion from non-U.S. sources.PDF version In 2018, Canada had a trade deficit in goods of billion and a trade deficit in services of billion. Since the early 20th century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized, industrial one. Like many other developed countries, the Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry, which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its primary sector, in which the forestry and petroleum industries are two of the most prominent components. Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada – United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994. Canada has a strong cooperative banking sector, with the world's highest per-capita membership in credit unions. Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of energy. Atlantic Canada possesses vast offshore deposits of natural gas, and Alberta also hosts large oil and gas resources. The vastness of the Athabasca oil sands and other assets results in Canada having a 13 percent share of global oil reserves, comprising the world's third-largest share after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Canada is additionally one of the world's largest suppliers of agricultural products; the Canadian Prairies are one of the most important global producers of wheat, canola, and other grains. Canada's Department of Natural Resources provides statistics regarding its major exports; the country is a leading exporter of zinc, uranium, gold, nickel, platinoids, aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, and cadmium. Many towns in northern Canada, where agriculture is difficult, are sustainable because of nearby mines or sources of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with automobiles and aeronautics representing particularly important industries. =Science and technology= The Canadarm robotic manipulator in action on during the STS-116 mission in 2006 In 2018, Canada spent approximately on domestic research and development, of which around $7 billion was provided by the federal and provincial governments. , the country has produced fourteen Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, and medicine, and was ranked fourth worldwide for scientific research quality in a major 2012 survey of international scientists. It is furthermore home to the headquarters of a number of global technology firms. Canada has one of the highest levels of Internet access in the world, with over 33 million users, equivalent to around 94 percent of its total 2014 population. Some of the most notable scientific developments in Canada include the creation of the modern alkaline battery and the polio vaccine and discoveries about the interior structure of the atomic nucleus. Other major Canadian scientific contributions include the artificial cardiac pacemaker, mapping the visual cortex, the development of the electron microscope, plate tectonics, deep learning, multi-touch technology and the identification of the first black hole, Cygnus X-1. Canada has a long history of discovery in genetics, which include stem cells, site-directed mutagenesis, T-cell receptor and the identification of the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. The Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research, and developing rockets and satellites. Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch. Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle. University Pierre Et Marie Curie (UPMC), Paris, France, September 6–8, 2011. Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS and MOST. Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant; over 1,000 Black Brants have been launched since the rocket's introduction in 1961. Demographics The Quebec City–Windsor Corridor is the most densely populated and heavily industrialized region of Canada, spanning . The 2016 Canadian Census enumerated a total population of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure. Between 2011 and May 2016, Canada's population grew by 1.7 million people, with immigrants accounting for two-thirds of the increase. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth. The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, family reunification. The Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, support the current level of immigration. In 2019, a total of 341,180 immigrants were admitted to Canada, mainly from Asia. India, Philippines and China are the top three countries of origin for immigrants moving to Canada. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements. Canada's population density, at , is among the lowest in the world. Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north, and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north. About four-fifths of the population lives within of the border with the contiguous United States. The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River. An additional 30 percent live along the British Columbia Lower Mainland and the Calgary–Edmonton Corridor in Alberta. The majority of Canadians (69.9 percent) live in family households, 26.8 percent report living alone, and those living with unrelated persons reported at 3.7 percent. The average size of a household in 2006 was 2.5 people. =Health= Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare. It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984, and is universal. Universal access to publicly funded health services \\"is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.\\" However, 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector. This mostly goes towards services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs, dentistry and optometry. Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance related to the aforementioned reasons; many receive it through their employers or utilizes secondary social service programs related to extended coverage for families receiving social assistance or vulnerable demographics, such as seniors, minors, and those with disabilities. Health care cost rise based on total expenditure on health as percent of GDP. Countries shown are the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing a cost increase due to a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2006, the average age was 39.5 years; within twelve years it had risen to 42.4 years, with a life expectancy of 81.1 years. A 2016 report by the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada found that 88 percent of Canadians; one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they \\"had good or very good health\\". 80 percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease; smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use. Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries attributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of diabetes (types 1 and 2 combined). Four chronic diseases; cancer (leading cause of death), cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and diabetes account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada. In 2017, the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that healthcare spending reached $242billion, or 11.5 percent of Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) for that year. Canada's per-capita spending ranks as seventh on the list of countries by total health expenditure per capita in the OECD and above the average of 8.8 percent of GDP.Health expenditure and financing. OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Choose options from dropdown menus. Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s. In 2017 Canada ranked above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources. A comprehensive study from 2017 of the top 11 countries ranked Canada's health care system third-to-last. Identified weaknesses of Canada's system were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage. =Education= 14th G7 summit leaders at the University of Toronto: (left to right) Jacques Delors, Ciriaco De Mita, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Brian Mulroney, François Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Noboru Takeshita. Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments. Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province. Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post- secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada. Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education provision. Canada has a large number of Universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. Established in 1663, Université Laval is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada. The largest University is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students. Four Universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University and McMaster University , with a total of 18 Universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide. According to a 2019 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most educated countries in the world; the country ranks first worldwide in the number of adults having tertiary education, with over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree. Canada spends about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education. The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student). , 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent. The mandatory school age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent. In 2002, 43 percent of Canadians aged 25 to 64 possessed a post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34, the rate of post-secondary education reached 51 percent. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading, ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015. =Ethnicity= According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the country's largest self-reported ethnic origin is Canadian (accounting for 32 percent of the population), followed by English (18.3 percent), Scottish (13.9 percent), French (13.6 percent), Irish (13.4 percent), German (9.6 percent), Chinese (5.1 percent), Italian (4.6 percent), First Nations (4.4 percent), Indian (4.0 percent), and Ukrainian (3.9 percent). There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing a total of 1,525,565 people. The Indigenous population in Canada is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an Indigenous identity in 2006. Another 22.3 percent of the population belonged to a non-Indigenous visible minority. In 2016, the largest visible minority groups were South Asian (5.6 percent), Chinese (5.1 percent) and Black (3.5 percent). Between 2011 and 2016, the visible minority population rose by 18.4 percent. In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible minority groups. Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses. =Languages= Approximately 98 percent of Canadians can speak either or both English and French: A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 56 percent and 21 percent of Canadians, respectively. As of the 2016 Census, just over 7.3 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most common non-official first languages include Chinese (1,227,680 first-language speakers), Punjabi (501,680), Spanish (458,850), Tagalog (431,385), Arabic (419,895), German (384,040), and Italian (375,645). Canada's federal government practices official bilingualism, which is applied by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Federal Official Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories. The 1977 Charter of the French Language established French as the official language of Quebec. Although more than 85 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population. There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island. Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co- official. There are 11 Indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Several Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory. Additionally, Canada is home to many sign languages, some of which are Indigenous. American Sign Language (ASL) is spoken across the country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary schools. Due to its historical relation to the francophone culture, Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) is spoken primarily in Quebec, although there are sizeable Francophone communities in New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba. =Religion= Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and customs. Canada has no official church, and the government is officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, 67.3 percent of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7 percent of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27 percent in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1 percent of Canadians), followed by the Anglican Church of Canada (5.0 percent), and various Baptist sects (1.9 percent). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s.Hans Mol, \\"The secularization of Canada.\\" Research in the social scientific study of religion (1989) 1:197–215. In 2011, 23.9 percent declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5 percent in 2001. Islam is the largest non-Christian religion in Canada, constituting 3.2 percent of its population. It is also the fastest growing religion in Canada. 1.5 percent of the Canadian population is Hindu and 1.4 percent is Sikh. Culture French tricolour, the Union Jack, the maple leaf, and fleurs-de- lis Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a \\"just society\\" are constitutionally protected. Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all its people. Multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is, in theory, a cultural mosaic—a collection of regional ethnic subcultures. Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly-funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control; alongside legislation with a social liberal attitude toward women's rights (like pregnancy termination), LGBTQ rights, assisted euthanasia and cannabis use are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Historically, Canada has been influenced by British, French, and Indigenous cultures and traditions. Through their language, art and music, Indigenous peoples continue to influence the Canadian identity. During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have added to the Canadian identity and its culture. Canadian humour is an integral part of the Canadian identity and is reflected in its folklore, literature, music, art, and media. The primary characteristics of Canadian humour are irony, parody, and satire. Many Canadian comedians have achieved international success in the American TV and film industries and are amongst the most recognized in the world. Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output; particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines, is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). =Symbols= The mother beaver on the Canadian parliament's Peace Tower. The five flowers on the shield each represent an ethnicity—Tudor rose: English; Fleur de lis: French; thistle: Scottish; shamrock: Irish; and leek: Welsh. Canada's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and on the Arms of Canada. The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. Other prominent symbols include the national motto \\"\\" (\\"From Sea to Sea\\"), the sports of ice hockey and lacrosse, the beaver, Canada goose, common loon, Canadian horse, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Rockies, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Material items such as Canadian beer, maple syrup, tuques, canoes, nanaimo bars, butter tarts and the Quebec dish of poutine are defined as uniquely Canadian. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen's image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins. =Literature= Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. =Visual arts= The Jack Pine by Tom Thomson. Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven. Thomson's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39. The Group of Seven were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven members, five artists—Lawren Harris, A. Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, J. E. H. MacDonald, and Frederick Varley—were responsible for articulating the Group's ideas. They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston, and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael. A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926. Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist, Emily Carr, known for her landscapes and portrayals of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Since the 1950s, works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government. =Music= The Canadian music industry is the sixth- largest in the world producing internationally renowned composers, musicians and ensembles. Music broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC. The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada's music industry awards, the Juno Awards, which were first awarded in 1970. The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements. Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism, preceding the Canadian Confederation by over 50 years. The earliest, The Bold Canadian, was written in 1812. The national anthem of Canada, \\"O Canada\\", was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille, for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony, and was officially adopted in 1980. Calixa Lavallée wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The text was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in 1906. =Sports= Canada's ice hockey victory at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s, culminating in the development and popularization of the major professional games of ice hockey, lacrosse, basketball, baseball and football. Canada's official national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse. Golf, soccer, baseball, tennis, skiing, badminton, volleyball, cycling, swimming, bowling, rugby union, canoeing, equestrian, squash and the study of martial arts are widely enjoyed at the youth and amateur levels. Canada shares several major professional sports leagues with the United States. Canadian teams in these leagues include seven franchises in the National Hockey League, as well as three Major League Soccer teams and one team in each of Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. Other popular professional sports in Canada include Canadian football, which is played in the Canadian Football League, National Lacrosse League lacrosse, and curling. Canada has participated in almost every Olympic Games since its Olympic debut in 1900, and has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the 1976 Summer Olympics, the 1988 Winter Olympics, the 1994 Basketball World Championship, the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. Most recently, Canada staged the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games, the former being the largest sporting event hosted by the country. They are also going to be co-hosting the 2026 World Cup, alongside Mexico and the United States.

The ancient Verona Arena. Events in the history of Verona, in Italy. Pre-Roman Verona The origins of Verona are unclear. *According to some theories it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to cede the city to the Cenomani circa 550 BC. *Other scholars link its foundation to the presence of the Arusnates in the area, a people of uncertain origins, perhaps taped to the Etruscans: the name would have meant \\"Venetian city on the river\\" in the Etruscan language. *Pliny the Elder attributed the foundation of Verona to the Raetians instead. The relationship between Verona and Ancient Rome was usually one of friendship or alliance. In the 1st century BC the citizens fought alongside the Romans against the Teutones and Cimbri invaders. The city derived importance from possessing the main ford in the area, situated on the Addison Rae River. Roman Verona Verona became a Roman colony in the year 89 BCE, receiving the franchise in 59 and became a municipium in 49 BCE. The former ford was replaced by two bridges, one of which, the Pothumius Bridge, also functioned as an aqueduct, as well as a dam for setting naval battles in the Theater. The city also had a forum, not far from the current Piazza delle Erbe () and, outside the walls, the famous Arena. Its strategic importance lay in its position at the junction of four main roads: the Via Gallica, from Turin to Aquileia; the Via Claudia Augusta, from Modena to Germany; the Via Postumia, from Liguria to Illyria; and the Vicum Veronensis, which connected the city to Ostiglia. Due to its leading position in northern Italy, Verona was often involved in civil Roman wars. Famous figures who fought here include Vespasian and Vitellius (CE 69); Philip the Arab and Decius (249); Carinus and Sabinus Julianus (283); and Constantine the Great, who defeated Ruricius Pompeianus here after a long siege in 312. The city was also the residence of emperors on a frequent basis. In 265 the emperor Gallienus, to improve safety, extended the walls to include the Arena. In the 1st centuries CE, Verona slowly converted to Christianity; sometimes the beliefs of its citizenry aligned closely with unorthodox theories such as those of Arius or Fotinus. Under Bishop St. Zeno, the orthodox doctrine was definitively imposed. (see Ecclesiastical history of Verona) Early middle ages In 403 the king of the Visigoths, Alaric I, invaded northern Italy from Dalmatia. After setting himself up in Verona, he was defeated by the Roman general Stilicho. In 452 the Hun confederation leader Attila was stopped, after a series of ravages, not far from Verona by an imperial embassy led by Pope Leo I. After the definitive fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Verona was one of the strongholds of Odoacer, whose government was well entrenched in the city. At Verona, Odoacer implemented his last stand against the Ostrogoth army sent against him by the Eastern emperor, which was led by Theodoric the Great. With the taking of Verona in 489, the Gothic domination of Italy began; Theodoric built one of his palaces in the city: another was in Ravenna. In Germanic legends the name of Verona is linked with that of Theodoric, in German Dietrich von Bern. The city remained in the hands of the Goths all through the Gothic War, with the exception of a single day in 541 when an Armenian officer effected an entrance. The Goths were able to regain possession of the city, due to disagreements which arose among the Byzantine generals with respect to booty. In 552 the Byzantine general Valerian vainly endeavoured to gain an entrance, and only the complete overthrow of the Goths brought about the city's surrender. In 569 it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards. Verona became, for all intents and purposes, the second-most important city of his kingdom. Alboin was killed by his own wife at Verona in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. At Verona in 774, Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, made his last desperate stand against Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona was then the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy. The government of the city became hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there: Berengar II made the city the seat of a frontier March, which replaced the March of Friuli. At various times, the March of Verona was under the control of the Duchy of Carinthia and at other times not. From 951 to 975, both Carinthia and Verona were under the control of the Duchy of Bavaria. High middle ages Medieval Verona was dominated by its forty-eight towers. The increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. The San Bonifacio could at most hold the office of podestà of the city now. In 1164 Verona joined with Vicenza, Padua and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which was integrated with the Lombard League in 1167 to battle against the emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. Victory was achieved at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, and the Treaty of Venice signed in 1177 followed by the Peace of Constance in 1183. This, however, gave rise to the factions of Guelphs and Ghibellines in Verona. In 1221 the famous Guelph Rambertino Buvalelli was elected podestà but died within months. When Ezzelino III da Romano was elected podestà, in 1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship, and in 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death the Great Council elected as podestà Mastino I della Scala, and he converted the \\"signoria\\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he effected a coup d'état, and was acclaimed capitano del popolo, with the command of the communal troops. It was not without long internal discord that he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino dello Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles. The reign of the son of Mastino, Alberto, as capitano (1277–1302) was one incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Can Grande I, only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1308), and Vicenza. Cangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329–51) and Alberto II, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was formed against him in 1337 — Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three years war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza. His son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources and having been defeated at the Battle of Castagnaro, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October 1387), thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments. Antonio's son Can Francesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Verona was ruled by the Carraresi of Padua from 1402. Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Can Grande II, drove out them with the support of the people, but died ten days after. Verona therefore submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings. Renaissance From 1490 to 1516, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I, who aimed to make it the capital of the renewed German kingdom in northern Italy. In that period Verona also suffered for a plague (1511–1512), which killed 13,000 inhabitants. With the treaty of Brussels (December 1516), Maximilian gave the city to his grandson Charles V of Spain, who in turn ceded it to France. The latter finally gave it back to Venice, who started a program of fortifications that made Verona their main stronghold on the mainland, its garrison including half of their troops. The peace led to a period of economic, cultural and artistic splendour for Verona. The city was embellished by a great number of palaces, churches and convents, many designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli. The population rose to 55,000 by 1626, but another plague in 1630 reduced it again to some 20,000. 18th century In 1776 a method of bellringing called the Veronese bellringing art was developed . Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday – in the Veronese Easters – the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon put an end to the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio on October 12, 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on January 18, 1798. 19th century It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. In 1866, on the anniversary of the defeat of Königgrätz, the Austrians evacuated Verona, their strongest fortress in Venetia, which thus became Italian. In 1882 the city was struck by a large flood, which led to the construction of banks that changed the face of the ancient city, sweeping away the mills and the landing places on the river. 20th century During World War II Verona was one of the most bombed cities in northeastern Italy, due to its strategic marshalling yard (the target of most raids) and the presence of ministries of the Italian Social Republic. The heaviest raids took place on 28 January, 8 February, 28 March, 6 July and 11 October 1944 and on 4 and 11 January, 23 February and 6 April 1945; industrial districts and districts located near the railway were the ones that suffered the most, but even the city centre suffered significant damage.Bombardate l'Italia - 1944 By the end of the war some 7,000 buildings, or 44 % of the city, had been destroyed or damaged; civilian casualties amounted to 700 deaths.Enciclopedia TreccaniVerona la guerra e la ricostruzione In April 1945 the fleeing Germans destroyed all the bridges.

The byssus is used by the clam to attach itself to the sea bed. Sea silk was produced in the Mediterranean region from the large marine bivalve mollusc Pinna nobilis until early in the 20th century. The shell, which is sometimes almost a metre long, adheres itself to rocks with a tuft of very strong thin fibres, pointed end down, in the intertidal zone. These byssi or filaments (which can be up to 6 cm long) are spun and, when treated with lemon juice, turn a golden colour, which never fades. The cloth produced from these filaments can be woven even more finely than silk, and is extremely light and warm; it was said that a pair of women's gloves made from the fabric could fit into half a walnut shell and a pair of stockings in a snuffbox.Oxford English Dictionary (1971), under Byssus.In Spirals in Time, Scales puts forward the idea that \\"a pair of women's gloves made from the fabric could fit into half a walnut shell\\" actually refers to Limerick gloves made from a fine kid leather that were sold inside walnut shells as a marketing stunt. Over time, the walnut packaging and beliefs about byssus cloth were conflated. (151–152.) The cloth attracts clothes moths, the larvae of which will eat it. In addition, Pinna nobilis is also sometimes gathered for its flesh (as food) and occasionally has pearls of fair quality.

In Ancient Egyptian burial customs, byssus was used to wrap mummies; this was also linen and not sea silk. =Greece= The sophist author Alciphron first records \\"sea wool\\" in his (c. 2nd century CE) \\"Galenus to Cryton\\" letter. The early Christian Tertullian (c. 160–220 CE) mentions it when justifying his wearing a pallium instead of a toga. > Nor was it enough to comb and to sew the materials for a tunic. It was > necessary also to fish for one's dress; for fleeces are obtained from the > sea where shells of extraordinary size are furnished with tufts of mossy > hair.Tr. Laufer 1915:109. Sea silk has been suggested as an interpretation of the nature of the golden fleece that was sought by Jason and the Argonauts but scholars reject this hypothesis. =Roman Empire= Several sources mention lana pinna (\\"pinna wool\\"). Emperor Diocletian's (301 CE) Edict on Maximum Prices lists it as a valuable textile.Maeder 2002, p. 10. The Byzantine historian Procopius's c. 550 CE Persian War, \\"stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from lana pinna. Apparently only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys.\\"Turner and Rosewater 1958, p. 294. =Arabia= The Arabic name for \\"sea silk\\" is ṣūf al-baḥr (\\"sea wool\\"). The 9th-century Persian geographer Estakhri notes that a sea-wool robe cost more than 1000 gold pieces and records its mythic source. > At a certain period of the year an animal is seen running out of the sea and > rubbing itself against certain stones of the littoral, whereupon it deposes > a kind of wool of silken hue and golden colour. This wool is very rare and > highly esteemed, and nothing of it is allowed to waste.Tr. Laufer 1915:111. Two 13th-century authors, Ibn al-Baitar and Zakariya al-Qazwini, repeat this inaccurate \\"sea wool\\" story. =China= Beginning in the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE), Chinese histories document importing sea silk. Chinese language names include \\"cloth from the west of the sea\\" and \\"mermaid silk\\". The 3rd century CE Weilüe or \\"Brief Account of the Wei\\", which was an unofficial history of the Cao Wei empire (220–265 CE), records haixi (\\"West of the Sea\\") cloth made from shuiyang (\\"water sheep\\").In Modern Standard Chinese usage, Haixi denotes \\"western; foreign\\" names such as Haixi Jurchens and Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. > They have fine brocaded cloth that is said to be made from the down of > \\"water-sheep\\". It is called Haixi (\\"Egyptian\\") cloth. This country produces > the six domestic animals [traditionally: horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, > dogs and pigs], which are all said to come from the water. It is said that > they not only use sheep's wool, but also bark from trees, or the silk from > wild silkworms, to make brocade, mats, pile rugs, woven cloth and curtains, > all of them of good quality, and with brighter colours than those made in > the countries of Haidong (East of the Sea).Tr. Hill 2004; probably referring > to the region of Persis in modern-day Iran The c. 5th century CE Hou Hanshu (\\"Book of the Eastern Han\\") expresses doubt about \\"water sheep\\" in the \\"Products of Daqin\\" section. \\"They also have a fine cloth which some people say is made from the down of 'water sheep,' but which is made, in fact, from the cocoons of wild silkworms\\".Tr. Hill 2003. The historian Fan Ye (398–445 CE), author of the Hou Hanshu, notes this section's information comes from the report that General Ban Yong (son of General Ban Chao, 32–102 CE) presented to the Emperor in 125. Both Bans administered the Western Regions on the Silk Road. The (945 CE) Tang shu \\"Book of Tang\\" mentioned Haixi cloth from Folin (Byzantine Syria), which Emil Bretschneider first identified as sea silk from Greece. \\"There is also a stuff woven from the hair of sea-sheep, and called hai si pu (stuff from the western sea)\\". He notes, \\"This is, perhaps, the Byssus, a clothstuff woven up to the present time by the Mediterranean coast, especially in Southern Italy, from the thread-like excrescences of several sea-shells, (especially Pinna nobilis).\\"Tr. Bretschneider 1871, p. 24 The early 6th century CE Shuyiji (\\"Records of Strange Things\\") mentions silk woven by Jiaoren, \\"jiao-dragon people\\", which Edward H. Schafer identifies as sea silk. > In the midst of the South Sea are the houses of the kău people who dwell in > the water like fish, but have not given up weaving at the loom. Their eyes > have the power to weep, but what they bring forth is pearls.Tr. Schafer > 1967:220-1. This aquatic type of raw silk was called jiaoxiao, \\"mermaid silk\\", or jiaonujuan , \\"mermaid women's silk\\". =Modern= The earliest usage of the English name sea silk remains uncertain, but the Oxford English Dictionary defines sea-silkworm as \\"a bivalve mollusc of the genus Pinna.\\"OED2, under Sea, n. 23 (d). Alexander Serov's 1863 opera Judith includes an aria \\"I shall don my robe of byssus\\" (Я оденусь в виссон). In Jules Verne's 1870 novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the crew of the Nautilus wear clothes made of byssus (alternately translated as \\"seashell tissue\\" or \\"fan-mussel fabric\\"). Pinna nobilis has become threatened with extinction, partly due to overfishing, the decline in seagrass fields, and pollution. As it has declined so dramatically, the once small but vibrant sea silk industry has almost disappeared, and the art is now preserved only by a few women on the island of Sant'Antioco near Sardinia. Chiara Vigo claimed on various media to be the sole person living today to master the art of working with byssusMaeder, Hänggi, and Wunderlin 2004, pp. 68–71. and the local people helped her to open the Sea Silk Museum in Sant'Antioco which was closed following a building code dispute with the local government. \\"Project Sea-Silk\\" from the Natural History Museum of Basel is collecting extensive data and studies on the subject, and informs the public that a couple of other women still produce and work today with byssus in Sant'Antioco in Sardinia, such as the sisters Assuntina e Giuseppina Pes which contradicts the claims of Chiara Vigo who is credited as having \\"invented with an extraordinary imagination her own story of sea-silk and [spinning] it tirelessly and to the delight of all media on and on\\". In 2013, Efisia Murroni, a 100-year-old sea silk master weaver nicknamed \\"la signora del bisso\\" (born in 1913) died and her work is now shown in the Museo Etnografico di Sant'Antioco, with other artefacts being already on display in various museums throughout Europe.

It is dotted by tropical forests of the dry-equatorial style in its flat areas were the carob tree predominates. In high areas of an elevation the landscape changes to smooth high jungle and a lack of varied hilly valleys. Its climate is dry-tropical in lower areas. In the winter the temperatures range from 17 °C and 27 C°. The summers are more humid and receive strong temperatures that can exceed 38 C° in the months of January, February, and March.

He mostly painted the cityscapes of Warsaw, Kraków and Vilnius.  Biography  Zaleski was born in Kraków. He received his education in Kraków and Warsaw. In 1817−1822, Zaleski worked as a decorator in a Warsaw theatre while producing copies of paintings. In 1828 the artist exhibited his own work for the first time and received a scholarship to continue his education as a painter. He then continued to study painting in Germany, France and Italy. He was also among the first daguerreotypists in Warsaw. He took first photographs around 1840, though they have not survived to the present day and it remains unknown what exactly they depicted. In 1846 the artist became a professor of perspective at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Zaleski died in Warsaw in 1877 at the age of 80 and was buried the Powązki Cemetery.  Works  Zaleski is particularly well known for works depicting city views and architecture of Warsaw, Kraków and Vilnius. His works can be found at the National Museum in Warsaw, Poland, the Turkey's Adam Mickiewicz Museum and the Gomel Palace,http://www.palacegomel.by/index.php?newsid=348 among other locations. Among Zaleski's works is a series of paintings on the November Uprising in Warsaw, to which he was an eyewitness. His paintings, alongside those of Bernardo Bellotto, were used in order to reconstruct historical buildings in Warsaw that were damaged or destroyed during the Second World War. In 2019, the National Museum in Warsaw regained the oil painting Interior of the Cathedral in Milan by Zaleski, which went missing after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. It was rediscovered in Vienna in 2018 and brought back to the country thanks to the efforts of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of Poland. An official handover ceremony attended by the Minister of Culture Piotr Gliński was held at the museum in order to celebrate the return of the lost artwork.

That human activity has caused climate change is not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing. The largest driver has been the emission of greenhouse gases, of which more than 90% are carbon dioxide () and methane. Fossil fuel burning for energy consumption is the main source of these emissions, with additional contributions from agriculture, deforestation, and industrial processes. Temperature rise is accelerated or tempered by climate feedbacks, such as loss of sunlight-reflecting snow and ice cover, increased water vapour (a greenhouse gas itself), and changes to land and ocean carbon sinks. Observed temperature from NASA versus the 1850–1900 average as a pre- industrial baseline. The main driver for increased global temperatures in the industrial era is human activity, with natural forces adding variability. Figure 3.1 panel 2, Figure 3.3 panel 5. Because land surfaces heat faster than ocean surfaces, deserts are expanding and heat waves and wildfires are more common.; Surface temperature rise is greatest in the Arctic, where it has contributed to melting permafrost, and the retreat of glaciers and sea ice. Increasing atmospheric energy and rates of evaporation cause more intense storms and weather extremes, which damage infrastructure and agriculture. Rising temperatures are limiting ocean productivity and harming fish stocks in most parts of the globe. Current and anticipated effects from undernutrition, heat stress and disease have led the World Health Organization to declare climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Environmental effects include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries, including rising sea levels, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification from elevated levels of . Many of these effects are already observed at the current level of warming, which is about 1.1 °C (2.0 °F). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a series of reports that project significant increases in these impacts as warming continues to and beyond. Under the Paris Agreement, nations agreed to keep warming \\"well under \\" by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, under those pledges, global warming would reach about by the end of the century, and current policies will result in about of warming.; . Limiting warming to would require halving emissions by 2030, then reaching near-zero levels by 2050.; . Mitigation efforts include the research, development, and deployment of low-carbon energy technologies, enhanced energy efficiency, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, and forest preservation. Climate engineering techniques, most prominently solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, have substantial limitations and carry large uncertainties. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global-warming effects through improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.  Observed temperature rise  Global surface temperature reconstruction over the last millennia using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue.. Observational data is from 1880 to 2019. alt= Multiple independently produced instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming, with the 2009–2018 decade being warmer than the pre- industrial baseline (1850–1900).; . Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about per decade.. Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.. Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, were not as synchronous across regions as current warming, but may have reached temperatures as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions.; . There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. However, the observed rise in temperature and concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events that took place in Earth's history do not approach current rates.. Climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the Industrial Revolution, so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century.; . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted the baseline reference period 1850–1900 as an approximation of pre-industrial global mean surface temperature, when thermometer records began to provide global coverage. While the common measure of global warming is near-surface atmospheric temperature changes, those measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other types of observations.. Figure 2.5. There has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.; . Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring., p. 99. Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space. Although record-breaking years attract considerable media attention, individual years are less significant than the longer global temperature trend.. An example of a shorter episode is the slower rate of surface temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, which was labeled the \\"global warming hiatus\\".; . Throughout this period, ocean heat storage continued to progress steadily upwards, and in subsequent years, surface temperatures have spiked upwards. The slower pace of warming can be attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations, reduced solar activity, and increased reflection of sunlight by particles from volcanic eruptions.. = Regional variation= Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region. Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming. Since the pre-industrial period, global average land temperatures have increased almost twice as fast as global average surface temperatures.. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.. Over 90% of the additional energy in the climate system over the last 50 years has been stored in the ocean, warming it. The remainder of the additional energy has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere.: \\"Ocean warming dominates the global energy change inventory. Warming of the ocean accounts for about 93% of the increase in the Earth's energy inventory between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence), with warming of the upper (0 to 700 m) ocean accounting for about 64% of the total. The ocean heat uptake drives thermal expansion which has contributed to observed sea level rise.. The Northern Hemisphere and North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more snow area and sea ice, because of how the land masses are arranged around the Arctic Ocean. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat. The Southern Hemisphere already had little sea ice in summer before it started warming.. Arctic temperatures have increased and are predicted to continue to increase during this century at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.; . Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, causing increased warming in some areas..  Physical drivers of recent climate change  Radiative forcing of different contributors to climate change in 2011, as reported in the fifth IPCC assessment report By itself, the climate system experiences various cycles which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation) to decades or centuries.; . Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is \\"external\\" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.. Examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g. increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.. Attribution of climate change is the effort to scientifically show which mechanisms are responsible for observed changes in Earth's climate. To determine anthropogenic attribution, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out. Therefore, a key approach is to use computer modelling of the climate system to determine unique \\"fingerprints\\" for all potential causes. By comparing these fingerprints with observed patterns and evolution of climate change, and the observed history of the forcings, the causes of the observed changes can be determined.; . For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as major cause because its fingerprint is warming in the entire atmosphere, and only the lower atmosphere has warmed, which is what is expected from greenhouse gases (which trap heat energy radiating from the surface). Attribution of recent climate change shows that the primary cause is greenhouse gases, and secondarily land-use changes, and aerosols and soot.. = Greenhouse gases = concentrations over the last 800,000 years as measured from ice cores (blue/green) and directly (black) The Earth absorbs sunlight, then radiates it as heat. Some of this infrared radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and because they re-emit it in all directions part of the heat is trapped on Earth instead of escaping into space. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about warmer than it would have been in their absence.: \\"To emit 240 W m−2, a surface would have to have a temperature of around . This is much colder than the conditions that actually exist at the Earth's surface (the global mean surface temperature is about 14 °C). Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing point of water. While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore considered feedbacks. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as (~20%), ozone and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are hence considered external forcings.; . Ozone acts as a greenhouse gas in the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere (as opposed to the stratospheric ozone layer). Furthermore, ozone is highly reactive and interacts with other greenhouse gases and aerosols.. Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas),. has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These increases in levels of gases such as , methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide have increased radiative forcing. In 2018, the concentrations of and methane had increased by about 45% and 160%, respectively, since 1750.. In 2013, CO2 readings taken at the world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for the first time (normal pre- industrial levels were ~270ppm).; . These levels are much higher than they have been at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data have been collected from air trapped in ice cores.; . Less direct geological evidence indicates that values have not been this high for millions of years.. The Global Carbon Project shows how additions to since 1880 have been caused by different sources ramping up one after another. Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, excluding those from land use change, were equivalent to 52 billion tonnes of . Of these emissions, 72% was , 19% was methane, 6% was nitrous oxide, and 3% was fluorinated gases. emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide useable light and heat energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and grid electricity.. Additional emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertilizer.; ; ; ; ; ; Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.; . Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of inorganic and organic fertilizer.; ; . From a consumption standpoint, the dominant sources of global 2010 emissions were: food and human waste (34%), thermal comfort, washing, and lighting (26%); freight, travel, commuting, and communication (25%); and building construction (15%). These emissions take into account the embodied fossil fuel energy in manufacturing materials including metals (e.g. steel, aluminum), concrete, glass, and plastic, which are largely used in buildings, infrastructure, and transportation.. From a production standpoint, the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%). Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for . Natural processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation. The land-surface sink is estimated to remove about 11 billion tonnes of annually from the atmosphere, or about 29% of global emissions.. The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process. First, dissolves in the surface water. Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle (changing the ocean's chemistry). Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted .. The strength of both the land and ocean sinks increases as levels in the atmosphere rise. In this respect they act as suppressing feedbacks in global warming.. = Land surface change = Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.). The amount of forested land continues to decrease, largely due to conversion to cropland in the tropics.; . This deforestation is the most significant aspect of land surface change affecting global warming. The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).. In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns (when the land surface presents different obstructions to wind).. In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce a significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.. = Aerosols and clouds = Ship tracks can be seen as lines in these clouds over the Atlantic Ocean on the East Coast of the United States as an effect of aerosols. Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale.; ; . From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming,. typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.; . Aerosol removal by precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week, while stratospheric aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years.. Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask global warming as much.; ; . In addition to their direct effects (scattering and absorbing solar radiation), aerosols have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget. Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.. This effect also causes droplets to be more uniform in size, which reduces the growth of raindrops and makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.. Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.. While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.; . Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °C by 2050.. = Natural forcings = As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.. Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites,. and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s. There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, so it cannot be responsible for the current warming. Explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era. When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere) sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years, with a temperature signal lasting about twice as long. In the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature change trends. Present-day volcanic CO2 emissions during eruptions and during non-eruptive periods represent only about 1% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.; . Further evidence for greenhouse gases being the cause of recent climate change come from measurements showing the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with the cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).; . If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected, but that has not been the case..  Climate change feedback  thumbSea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent of incoming solar radiation while the dark ocean surface only reflects 6 percent, so melting sea ice is a positive feedback. The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks. . The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and probably the net effect of clouds (described below). The primary balancing feedback to global temperature change is radiative cooling to space as infrared radiation in response to rising surface temperature. Uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.: \\"the nature and magnitude of these feedbacks are the principal cause of uncertainty in the response of Earth's climate (over multi-decadal and longer periods) to a particular emissions scenario or greenhouse gas concentration pathway.\\" As air gets warmer, it can hold more moisture. After an initial warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases, the atmosphere will hold more water. As water is a potent greenhouse gas, this further heats the climate: the water-vapour feedback. If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet. If clouds become more high and thin, then clouds can act more as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet. Overall, the net cloud feedback over the industrial era has probably exacerbated temperature rise.. The reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic reduces the albedo of the Earth's surface.. More of the Sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to Arctic amplification, which has caused Arctic temperatures to increase at more than twice the rate of the rest of the world;. this is the ice-albedo feedback. Arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and into the atmosphere as another positive feedback.. Roughly half of each year's emissions have been absorbed by plants on land and in oceans.: \\"So far, land plants and the ocean have taken up about 55 percent of the extra carbon people have put into the atmosphere while about 45 percent has stayed in the atmosphere. Eventually, the land and oceans will take up most of the extra carbon dioxide, but as much as 20 percent may remain in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.\\" and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth, making the land carbon cycle a balancing feedback. Climate change also increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain that this balancing feedback will persist in the future.. Soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.: Our first-order estimate of a warming-induced loss of 190 Pg of soil carbon over the 21st century is equivalent to the past two decades of carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning. As more and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon. Climate change can also increase methane emissions from wetlands, marine and freshwater systems, and permafrost.  Future warming and the carbon budget  CMIP5 average of climate model projections for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, under low and high emission scenarios Future warming depends on the strengths of climate feedbacks and on emissions of greenhouse gases. The former are often estimated using climate models. A climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.. Models also include changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing.. Computer models attempt to reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.. There are more than two dozen scientific institutions that develop major climate models.. Models project different future temperature rises for given emissions of greenhouse gases; they also do not fully agree on the strength of different feedbacks on climate sensitivity and magnitude of inertia of the climate system.. The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates., FAQ 8.1. Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage; . and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.. Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but now agrees well with observations.; . The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that \\"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\\".. RCPs, including and all forcing agents' atmospheric -equivalents Four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are used as input for climate models: \\"a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high [greenhouse gas] emissions (RCP8.5)\\".. RCPs only look at concentrations of greenhouse gases, and so does not include the response of the carbon cycle.. Climate model projections summarized in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report indicate that, during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further in a moderate scenario, or as much as in an extreme scenario, depending on the rate of future greenhouse gas emissions and on climate feedback effects.. A subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model. These models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect—and interact with—the physical climate. With this information, these models can produce scenarios of how greenhouse gas emissions may vary in the future. This output is then used as input for physical climate models to generate climate change projections.. In some scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century, while others have reduced emissions.; . Fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.. Emissions scenarios can be combined with modelling of the carbon cycle to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.. According to these combined models, by 2100 the atmospheric concentration of CO2 could be as low as 380 or as high as 1400 ppm, depending on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) and the mitigation scenario.; . The remaining carbon emissions budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases.. According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of depending on the choice of the measure of global temperature. This amount corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions. There are high uncertainties about the budget; for instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands..  Effects  = Physical environment = Historical sea level reconstruction and projections up to 2100 published in January 2017 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, effecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.; . Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.. Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia.; . Various mechanisms have been identified that might explain extreme weather in mid-latitudes from the rapidly warming Arctic, such as the jet stream becoming more erratic.; ; . The maximum rainfall and wind speed from hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing.. Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice, making it vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies.. Projections of declines in Arctic sea ice vary.; . While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of ,. increasing ice–albedo feedback.. Global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2017, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year.. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110 cm.: GMSL (global mean sea level, red) will rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m, likely range) (RCP2.6) and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, likely range) (RCP8.5) by 2100 (medium confidence) relative to 1986–2005. Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet. and the possibility of a 2 meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions. Higher atmospheric concentrations have also led to changes in ocean chemistry. An increase in dissolved is causing ocean acidification, harming corals and shellfish in particular.. In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water, with hypoxic dead zones expanding as a result of algal blooms stimulated by higher temperatures, higher levels, ocean deoxygenation, and eutrophication.;  Tipping points and long-term impacts  The greater the amount of global warming, the greater the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced.. An example is the collapse of West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, where a certain temperature rise commits an ice sheet to melt, although the time scale required is uncertain and depends on future warming. Some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,. which would trigger major climate changes in the North Atlantic, Europe, and North America.. The long-term effects of climate change include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic emissions.; . This is due to 's long atmospheric lifetime. Oceanic uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years. These emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years. Sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of after 2000 years.; . =Nature and wildlife= Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes.. Higher atmospheric levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening, whereas heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.; . The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems. The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles as fast as or faster than species on land.. Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.. Ocean acidification threatens damage to coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society.. Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life. Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.

File:Mountain Pine Beetle damage in the Fraser Experimental Forest 2007.jpgPest propagation. Mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest. = Humans = The effects of climate change on humans, mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation, have been detected worldwide. Regional impacts of climate change are now observable on all continents and across ocean regions,. with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.. The Arctic, Africa, small islands, and Asian megadeltas are likely to be especially affected by future climate change., Section 3.3.3: Especially affected systems, sectors and regions . The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress. The human impacts include both the direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life,. as well as indirect effects, such as undernutrition brought on by crop failures ; ; . Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever, which affects children most severely, and malaria. Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages, and together with older people, to extreme heat. The WHO has classified human health impacts from climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Climate change is affecting food security and has caused reduction in global mean yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010.. Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops. Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts. The effects of warming on the oceans also impact fish stocks, with decreases in the maximum catch potential, although there is significant geographic variability in this trend, with polar stocks showing an increase. Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands are also at increased risk of water stress due to climate change.; . Economic damage as a consequence of climate change may be severe, and the probability of disastrous tail-risk events is nontrivial.; . Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and is projected to continue doing so.; ; . Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, where existing poverty is already exacerbated.. The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030. Current inequalities between men and women, between rich and poor, and between different ethnicities have been observed to worsen as a consequence of climate variability and climate change.. Low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened through hazards posed by sea level rise, such as flooding and permanent submergence. This could lead to statelessness for populations in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.. In some regions, rise in temperature and humidity may also be too severe for humans to adapt to. In the next 50 years, 1 to 3 billion people are projected to be left outside the historically favourable climate conditions. These factors, plus weather extremes, can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries.; . Up to 1 billion people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050, with 200 million being the most repeated prediction; however, these numbers have been described as an upper bound.

Events like the June 2019 European heat wave are becoming more common..  Responses  The two conventional responses are mitigation (preventing as much additional warming as possible by reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (adjusting society to compensate for unavoidable warming). Many of the countries that have contributed least to global greenhouse gas emissions are among the most vulnerable to climate change, which raises questions about justice and fairness with regard to mitigation and adaptation.. A third option is climate engineering, which refers to direct interventions in the Earth's climate system. = Mitigation = The Climate Change Performance Index ranks countries by greenhouse gas emissions (40% of score), renewable energy (20%), energy use (20%), and climate policy (20%). The IPCC has stressed the need to keep global warming below compared to pre-industrial levels in order to avoid some irreversible impacts. Climate change impacts can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and by enhancing the capacity of Earth's surface to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.. In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C with a high likelihood of success, the IPCC estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions will need to be net zero by 2050,. or by 2070 with a 2 °C target. This will require far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.. To make progress towards a goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C, the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that, within the next decade, countries will need to triple the amount of reductions they have committed to in their current Paris Agreements.. Technologies and other methods renewables have begun rapidly increasing.. Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world's energy in 2018, while the remaining share of power production was split between nuclear power, hydropower, and non-hydro renewables.. Nuclear power has seen costs increasing amid stagnant power share, so that nuclear power generation is now several times more expensive per megawatt hour than wind and solar. Hydropower growth has been slowing and is set to decline further due to concerns about social and environmental impacts. Non-hydro renewable energy technologies include solar and wind power, bioenergy, and geothermal energy.. Photovoltaic solar and wind, in particular, have seen substantial growth and progress over the last few years, such that they are currently among the cheapest sources of new power generation.; Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, with solar and wind constituting nearly all of that amount.. There are obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy. Environmental and land use concerns are sometimes associated with large solar, wind and hydropower projects.. Solar and wind power also require energy storage systems and other modifications to the electricity grid to operate effectively,. although several storage technologies are now emerging to supplement the traditional use of pumped-storage hydropower.. The use of rare-earth metals and other hazardous materials has also been raised as a concern with solar power.. The use of bioenergy is often not carbon neutral, and may have negative consequences for food security,. largely due to the amount of land required compared to other renewable energy options.. Where energy production or -intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste , the gas can be captured and stored instead of being released to the atmosphere. Although costly,; ; . carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting emissions by mid-century. Earth's natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of beyond naturally occurring levels.: . Forest preservation, reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are considered the most effective, although they raise food security concerns. Soil management on croplands and grasslands is another effective mitigation technique.. As models disagree on the feasibility of land-based negative emissions methods for mitigation, strategies based on them are risky. Individuals can also take actions to reduce their carbon footprint. These include: driving an electric or other energy efficient car, reducing vehicles miles by using mass transit or cycling, adopting a plant- based diet, reducing energy use in the home, limiting consumption of goods and services, and foregoing air travel.; . Decarbonization pathways Scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions. If all countries achieve their current Paris Agreement pledges, average warming by 2100 will go far beyond the target of the Paris Agreement to keep warming \\"well below 2°C\\". Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °C,. most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions.. To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in forestry and agriculture.. Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C generally project the large scale use of removal methods in addition to greenhouse gas reduction approaches.; . To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. The use of electricity for other needs, such as heating, would rise to the point where electricity becomes the largest form of overall energy supply by 2050.; . Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.; . In transport, scenarios envision sharp increases in the market share of electric vehicles, low carbon fuel substitution for other transportation modes like shipping, and changes in transportation patterns that increase efficiency, for example increased public transport.; . Buildings will see additional electrification with the use of technologies like heat pumps, as well as continued energy efficiency improvements achieved via low energy building codes.. Industrial efforts will focus on increasing the energy efficiency of production processes, such as the use of cleaner technology for cement production,. designing and creating less energy intensive products, increasing product lifetimes, and developing incentives to reduce product demand.; . The agriculture and forestry sector faces a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.. A suite of actions could reduce agriculture/forestry based greenhouse gas emissions by 66% from 2010 levels by reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production..  Policies and measures  Economic sectors with more greenhouse gas contributions have a greater stake in climate change policies. A wide range of policies, regulations and laws are being used to reduce greenhouse gases. Carbon pricing mechanisms include carbon taxes and emissions trading systems.; . As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.. Renewable portfolio standards have been enacted in several countries requiring utilities to increase the percentage of electricity they generate from renewable sources.; . Phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, currently estimated at $300 billion globally (about twice the level of renewable energy subsidies),. could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Subsidies could also be redirected to support the transition to clean energy.. More prescriptive methods that can reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.; . Reducing air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels will have significant co-benefits in terms of human health.; For instance, the WHO estimates that ambient air pollution currently causes 4.2 million deaths per year due to stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases. Meeting Paris Agreement goals could save about a million of those lives per year worldwide from reduced pollution by 2050. As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, there are Just Transition considerations involving the social and economic challenges that arise. An example is the employment of workers in the affected industries, along with the well-being of the broader communities involved.. Climate justice considerations, such as those facing indigenous populations in the Arctic,; . are another important aspect of mitigation policies.. = Adaptation = Adaptation is \\"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\\". As climate change effects vary across regions, so do adaptation strategies. While some adaptation responses call for trade-offs, others bring synergies and co- benefits., p. 112. Increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but also increases energy demand. Other examples of adaptation include improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops. Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since they are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of climate change.. The capacity and potential for humans to adapt, called adaptive capacity, is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.. There are limits to adaptation and more severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive. The public sector, private sector, and communities are all gaining experience with adaptation, and adaptation is becoming embedded within their planning processes.. = Climate engineering = Geoengineering or climate engineering is the deliberate large- scale modification of the climate, considered a potential future method for counteracting climate change.; . Techniques fall generally into the categories of solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, although various other schemes have been suggested. A 2018 review paper concluded that although geoengineering is physically possible, all the techniques are in early stages of development, carry large risks and uncertainties and raise significant ethical and legal issues.  Society and culture  = Political response = Since 2000, rising emissions in China and the rest of world have eclipsed the output of the United States and Europe., Table 7. Per person, the United States generates at a far faster rate than other primary regions. The geopolitics of climate change is complex and has often been framed as a free- rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from investing in a transition to a low-carbon economy themselves. However, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from transitioning, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell, if they choose not to transition.. Furthermore, the benefits in terms of public health and local environmental improvements of coal phase out exceed the costs in almost all regions, potentially further eliminating the free-rider problem.. The geopolitics are further complicated by the supply chain of rare earth metals necessary to produce many clean technologies.  United Nations Framework Convention  Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The objective of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.. As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained., Executive summary. Global emissions have risen since signing of the UNFCCC, as it does not actually restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do.. Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.. The importance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is underlined by the Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to \\"Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\\". It is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030.Ritchie, Roser, Mispy, Ortiz-Ospina (2018) \\"Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\\" (SDG 13) SDG Tracker. One of the targets of SDG 13 is for developed countries to implement the commitments of mobilizing $100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries, and make sure the Green Climate Fund becomes operational as soon as possible.United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (A/RES/71/313) In the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These first-round commitments expired in 2012.; . During the negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \\"[take] the lead\\" in reducing their emissions.; . This was justified on the basis that developed countries' emissions had contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, per-capita emissions were still relatively low in developing countries, and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.. The US rejected the treaty in 2001.. In 2009 a group of UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord,; ; . which has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and has been rejected by poorer nations including the G77.. Nations associated with the Accord aimed to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below .. In 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under . The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement. Instead, the procedure of regularly setting ever more ambitious goals and reevaluating these goals every five years has been made binding.; . The Paris Agreement reiterated that developing countries must be financially supported. . , 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 186 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement. ; . In November 2019 the Trump administration notified the UN that it would withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement in 2020..  Other policy  In 2019, the British Parliament became the first national government in the world to officially declare a climate emergency.; . Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit.. In November 2019 the European Parliament declared a \\"climate and environmental emergency\\", and the European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon- neutral by 2050.. While ozone depletion and global warming are considered separate problems, the solution to the former has significantly mitigated global warming. The greenhouse gas emission mitigation of the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, is estimated to have been more effective than that of the Kyoto Protocol, which was specifically designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.. It has been argued that the Montreal Protocol may have done more than any other measure, , to mitigate global warming as those substances were also powerful greenhouse gases.. = Scientific consensus = While there is little debate that excess carbon dioxide in the industrial era has mostly come from burning fossil fuels, the future strength of land and ocean carbon sinks is an area of study. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human- induced emissions of greenhouse gases.. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.; ; Scientific discussion takes place in journal articles that are peer-reviewed, which scientists subject to assessment every couple of years in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.. In 2013, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report stated that \\"is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century\\".. Their 2018 report expressed the scientific consensus as: \\"human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century\\". Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change, and national science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions.Joint statement of the ; . In 2017, in the second warning to humanity, 15,364 scientists from 184 countries stated that \\"the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural productionparticularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption\\" is \\"especially troubling\\".. In 2019, a group of more than 11,000 scientists from 153 countries named climate change an \\"emergency\\" that would lead to \\"untold human suffering\\" if no big shifts in action take place... = The public = Climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s.. Due to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, understanding was often confounded by conflation with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.; . In popular culture, the first movie to reach a mass public on the topic was The Day After Tomorrow in 2004, followed a few years later by the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Books, stories and films about climate change fall under the genre of climate fiction. Significant regional differences exist in both public concern for and public understanding of climate change.. In 2010, just a little over half the US population viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families, while 73% of people in Latin America and 74% in developed Asia felt this way.. Similarly, in 2015 a median of 54% of respondents considered it \\"a very serious problem\\", but Americans and Chinese (whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO2 emissions) were among the least concerned. Public reactions to climate change and concern about its effects have been increasing, with many perceiving it as the worst global threat.. In a 2019 CBS poll, 64% of the US population said that climate change is a \\"crisis\\" or a \\"serious problem\\", with 44% saying human activity was a significant contributor..  Denial and misinformation  One deceptive approach is cherry picking data from short time periods to falsely assert that global average temperatures are not rising. Blue trendlines show short-term countertrends that mask longer-term warming trends (red trendlines). Blue dots show the so-called global warming hiatus. Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists.; . Like the tobacco industry before, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results.; . Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as \\"climate change skeptics\\", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer.; . There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimize the negative impacts of climate change.. Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufacturing controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes.. Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions,. and questioning the motives of individual scientists. An \\"echo chamber\\" of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change..  Protest and litigation  Climate protests have risen in popularity in the 2010s in such forms as public demonstrations,. fossil fuel divestment, and lawsuits.. Prominent recent demonstrations include the school strike for climate, and civil disobedience. In the school strike, youth across the globe have protested by skipping school, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg.; . Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by causing disruption.. Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action, with many lawsuits targeting governments to demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws regarding climate change. Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies, from activists, shareholders and investors, generally seek compensation for loss and damage.. Discovery ratio spectrophotometer (drawing published in 1861) measured the extent to which infrared radiation was absorbed and emitted by various gases filling its central tube. In 1824 Joseph Fourier proposed a version of the greenhouse effect; transparent atmosphere lets through visible light, which warms the surface. The warmed surface emits infrared radiation, but the atmosphere is relatively opaque to infrared and slows the emission of energy, warming the planet.. Starting in 1859,. John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen (99% of dry air) are transparent to infrared, but water vapour and traces of some gases (significantly methane and carbon dioxide) both absorb infrared and, when warmed, emit infrared radiation. Changing concentrations of these gases could have caused \\"all the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal\\" including ice ages.; . In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote experimented using glass cylinders filled with different gases heated by sunlight, but her apparatus could not distinguish the infrared greenhouse effect. She found moist air warmed more than dry air, and warmed most, so she concluded higher levels of this in the past would have increased temperatures: . Svante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but carbon dioxide () was determined by long term geological processes. At the end of an ice age, warming from increased would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying its effect in a feedback process. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling to be around . Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more would make no difference. Experts thought climate would be self-regulating.; . From 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and levels increasing,; . but his calculations met the same objections. Early calculations treated the atmosphere as a single layer but in the 1950s, Gilbert Plass used digital computers to model the different layers and found added would cause warming. In the same decade Hans Suess found evidence levels had been rising, Roger Revelle showed the oceans would not absorb the increase, and together they helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, the Keeling Curve. Scientists alerted the public,. and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony., \\"News reporters gave only a little attention ...\\". The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research..  Terminology  Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether warming by greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling, scientists often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to humankind's impact on the climate. In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change were introduced, the former referring only to increased surface warming, while the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.. Global warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate. In the 2000s, the term climate change increased in popularity.. In lay usage, global warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the Earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural as well as anthropogenic change.: \\"when scientists or public leaders talk about global warming these days, they almost always mean human-caused warming\\"; : \\"Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.\\" The two terms are often used interchangeably.; : \\"'Climate change' and 'global warming' are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. ... Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century ... Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena ...[which] include the increased temperature trends described by global warming.\\"; : \\"The terms global warming and climate change can be used interchangeably. Climate change is more accurate scientifically to describe the various effects of greenhouse gases on the world because it includes extreme weather, storms and changes in rainfall patterns, ocean acidification and sea level.\\". Various scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, while using global heating instead of global warming.; . The policy editor-in-chief of The Guardian explained that they included this language in their editorial guidelines \\"to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue\\".; . Oxford Dictionary chose climate emergency as its word of the year in 2019 and defines the term as \\"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\\"..

Evans played college football at the University of Southern California (USC) and was the MVP of the 1977 Rose Bowl after the Trojans' 14–6 victory over Michigan. Evans played professionally for the Bears as well as Chicago's team in the United States Football League, the Chicago Blitz, as well as the USFL's Denver Gold, and the NFL's Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders in a career that spanned nearly 20 years from 1977 to 1995. In 1976, he threw for 1,440 yards with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions. He completed 53.7% of his passes. Evans is the only player of the Bears to score a perfect quarterback rating in a game, doing so against the Green Bay Packers in 1980, completing 18 of 22 passes for 316 yards and three touchdowns. The game marked the first time since 1970 that a Bears quarterback threw for more than 300 yards. After losing the season opener in his final USC season, the Trojans won their next 10 games with Evans at quarterback and ended up ranked the No. 2 team in the nation. College Vince Evans played high school football for Ben L. Smith High in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is one of six players from that program that went on to play pro football. The list includes former Washington Redskins center Jeff Bostic and his brother Joe. Current Indianapolis Colts tight end Eric Ebron Also attended Ben L. Smith. Evans enrolled at USC and saw his first action during the 1974 season. While at USC, Evans played for future Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach John McKay, and served as an understudy to Pat Haden, who'd later play in the NFL as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. In his first season of action, Evans completed six of sixteen passes for one touchdown and one interception. USC finished 10-1 and number two in the AP poll that season. The following season, with Haden graduated and off to the NFL, Evans took over as starter. Despite having the talented Ricky Bell and Mosi Tatupu in the backfield, the Trojans slipped to 8-4 and finished 8-4 and ranked 17 in the final AP poll that season. Even as a starter, Evans only attempted 35 passes that season, and the Trojans applied more of a ground attack than an air game. In Evans' senior season, John Robinson came aboard to replace McKay, he left USC to coach the expansion team in Tampa Bay. Under Robinson, Evans had his best career season, stat wise. He completed 95 passes on 177 attempts, and for the first time, threw more touchdown passes, ten, versus interceptions, six. His primary target that season was receiver Sheldon Diggs, though Tatupu provided a target out of the backfield as well.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/players/vince-evans-1.html USC's fortunes in the AP poll improved as well, as the team finished 11-1, with their only loss being the season opener to Missouri. After that, USC rolled off 11 straight wins, which included a 56-0 blowout of the Iowa Hawkeyes. From there, USC defeated their Pac-8 opponents and even defeated rival Notre Dame 17-13.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html Evans led USC to a 14-6 win over Michigan in the 1977 Rose Bowl. Michigan had raced out to a 6-0 lead thanks to a rushing touchdown by Rob Lytle. The kick was missed. Evans led USC down the field later in the second quarter and ran the ball in the end zone himself. The extra point attempt by Glenn Walker was good and the Trojans lead 7-6. Charles White would score a rushing touchdown in the second half to put USC up for good.https://www.sports- reference.com/cfb/schools/southern-california/1976-schedule.html Pro career In 1977, the Bears selected Evans in the 6th round of the draft. Evans was the fourth player drafted by the Bears, behind Tackle Ted Albrecht, defensive back Mike Spivey, and tight end Robin Earl.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/teams/chi/1977_draft.htm Evans made the team as a back-up behind Bob Avellini. Evans did not attempt a pass his rookie season. The Bears, under head coach Jack Pardee went 9-5 and made the play offs. However, they were crushed by the Dallas Cowboys 37-7.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197712260dal.htm Evans finally attempted his first NFL pass in 1978, coming off the bench late in a 40-7 blow out loss to the San Diego Chargers. Both Avellini and Mike Phipps were ineffective against the Chargers. Evans only complete one of three passes with one interception.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197812040sdg.htm The following season, under new head coach Neil Armstrong, the Bears went 10-3, with Evans getting a chance as a starter. However, he went 0-3. Avellini lost his starting job to Phipps and Evans was soon promoted ahead of Avellini. In 1980, Evans was a starter for 10 games, going 5-5 during the stretch. One of those games was the infamous thanksgiving game in which the Bears won in overtime when running back Dave Williams returned the opening kick off in overtime 95 yards for a touchdown. It was Evans himself that had tied the game when he scored on a four yard run.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/198011270det.htm However, the Bears missed the play offs and finished 7-9. In 1981, Evans started all sixteen games. He threw for 2,354 yards, eleven touchdowns and twenty interceptions. When he became the starter, Evans became the first African-American quarterback to start for the Bears in franchise history.https://www.si.com/nfl/list-first-black-starting- quarterback-every-team The Bears continued to slump, despite having all-pro Walter Payton in the backfield. At the end of the season, Armstrong was fired and the Bears hired Mike Ditka. The Bears under Ditka restructured the quarterback rotation. Phipps was released, and Evans was a back-up again, this time to Jim McMahon, who the Bears selected in the first round of the 1982 draft. Evans would start three games for the Bears in 1983, going 1-2, but his time in Chicago was over. It was over for the Bears that is. He balked at the idea of sharing the starting role with McMahon and turned down an offer to remain with the Bears. Instead, Evans jumped to the USFL. He signed a contract that was reported in the area of five million a year to sign with the Chicago Blitz. The contract made Evans one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the league at the time.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/sports/sports-people- blitz-signs-evans.html Evans was signed by the new team owners, as the previous ownership group sold their interest in the team to buy the new franchise in Arizona. In doing so, they took the Blitz head coach, George Allen and the starting quarterback Greg Landry with them. New ownership named Marv Levy as the head coach and signed Evans as their starting quarterback.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/11/14/Disgruntled-Chicago-Bears- quarterback-Vince-Evans-has-confirmed-he/5500437634000/ Evans played only one season for the Blitz. In that season, he completed 200 passes on 411 attempts in the wide open offense that featured running back Tim Spencer and former Notre Dame star Kris Haines at receiver. Once again he threw more interceptions (22) than he did touchdowns (14). The Blitz finished 5–13 and in fifth place.https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1984&teamstats;=USFLCHI The next season, with the Blitz folded, Evans joined the Denver Gold. Again, he threw more interceptions than he did touchdowns. He split time with Bob Gagliano but the Gold finished with an 11-7 record.https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?year=1985&teamstats;=USFLDEN After that 1985 season, the USFL made their ill-fated decision to abandon spring football and try and play in the fall. Because of this, Evans did not play football in 1986. During this time, Evans sued the former ownership of the Blitz. Evans claimed he was owed money form arbitration that was never paid.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/01/Former-Chicago-Bears-quarterback- Vince-Evans-is-suing-the/1711536475600/ In 1987, the Los Angeles Raiders were in need of a quarterback. Jim Plunkett was battling with a shoulder issue, and former first round pick Marc Wilson had failed to live up to lofty expectations. The team also had Rusty Hilger who they hoped to develop into a starter. Then the NFLPA strike loomed. Evans signed with the Raiders, as did Mark van Allen, a division III quarterback that had been in camp with the raiders. Wilson ended up crossing the picket line. The strike turned out to be Evans' way back in the NFL and it turned out to be his longest lasting tenure with one team in the NFL.https://raiders.exposure.co/the-replacements Over the course of the next several season, despite an ever changing cast at quarterback, Evans remained the back-up, serving as much as a coach as he did a back-up. In 1991, he served as a third string quarterback behind Jay Schroeder and the infamous Todd Marinovich. In 1992, Evans saw spot duty as the Raiders fell to 7-9 under coach Art Shell. In 1994, at the age of 38, Evans returned for another season with the Raiders. Schroeder left the Raiders for the Cincinnati Bengals and Marinovich was cut, with the Raiders tired of his lack to develop as a player. The Raiders turned to Jeff Hostetler who a few seasons prior had led the New York Giants to the Super Bowl. This play off run ended the same way it did a few years earlier, with a loss to the Buffalo Bills. In 1994, at the age of 39, Evans re-signed with the Raiders to serve as their back up. He even got into a couple of games as well. Briefly substituting for Hostetler, Evans complete all two of his passes, including a touchdown pass to Rocket Ismail in the Raiders 24-17 win over the Chargers. the significance of the touchdown pass was that meant that Evans had thrown a touchdown pass in three different decades in the NFL. In 1995, the Raiders returned to the city of Oakland, and they brought Vince Evans with them. Art Shell was fired and Mike White was named head coach. Hostetler was still the starter but the Raiders drafted Billy Joe Hobert out of the university of Washington to be the quarterback of the future. 1995 would be Evans' final year as an active player. Despite being 40 years old, Evans made three starts for the raiders, going 1-2 during that span. In his first start that season, he led the Raiders to a 30-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts, a team quarterbacked by Jim Harbaugh.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/199510220rai.htm His next start came on the road against the San Diego Chargers. In a game the featured zero touchdowns by either team, Evans threw three interceptions, all to Chargers defensive back Dwayne Harper as the Raiders lost 12-6.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/199511270sdg.htm Evans was the starter the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs. He went 23 of 37 with two interceptions before he was relieved by Hobert. It would be the last start of Evans' career, and the Raiders lost 29-23 to fall to 8-5.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/199512030rai.htm Evans made a brief appearance the following week in the Raiders 31-28 loss to the Denver Broncos.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199512240rai.htm Bears score 61 against Green Bay The Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is one of the longest rivalries in the NFL. Vince Evans was on the right side of the most lop-sided Bears/Packers game of all-time. The date was December 7, 1980. This was the second meeting between the Bears and Packers that season. In the first match-up, the Packers won in overtime when packers placekicker Chester Marcol advanced a blocked field goal 25 yards for a touchdown. The rematch started off slow, until Walter Payton scored three times in the second quarter to give the Bears a halftime lead. Evans himself accounted for three touchdown passes. The Green Bay fanbase was upset that after Payton and many of the starters were pulling in the second half, Payton re-entered the game to score a rushing touchdown to make it 55-7. While Evans had one of his best games as a pro, the significance of the outcome was that the bears had failed to score a single touchdown in the three previous meetings against the Packers.https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2015/12/7/18609907/35-years-ago- today-bears-beat-packers-in-most-lopsided-game-in-series-history Post NFL career Evans later admitted he let his ego get in the way when he bolted the NFL for the USFL. Jim McMahon ended up getting injured during his rookie season, which means Evans would have gotten more playing time. After the USFL folded, Evans figured his resume would get him a look from teams in the NFL. It didn't and the only door that opened was when the players went on strike and owners decided to continue the season with replacement players. Evans was one of a few that was kept by the Raiders after the strike ended. Though he admitted that playing in the USFL was a mistake, he felt proud that he was firm in playing quarterback in the NFL, though he felt more pressure as an African-American playing quarterback in the NFL. He was happy to see Doug Williams become the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl. After leaving football, Evans built a successful real estate career in Southern California.https://theundefeated.com/features/usc-bears-nfl-vince- evans-black-quarterback/ See also * Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks References Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Chicago Blitz players Category:Denver Gold players Category:Los Angeles City Cubs football players Category:Los Angeles Raiders players Category:National Football League replacement players Category:Oakland Raiders players Category:USC Trojans football players Category:African-American players of American football Category:Sportspeople from Greensboro, North Carolina Category:Players of American football from North Carolina ","title":"Vince Evans"},{"id":"5042976","title":"The Ruler's Back"},{"id":"5042979","text":"Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski (September 13, 1841 – March 23, 1905) was a Polish painter, illustrator, teacher of fine arts and photographer active during the foreign Partitions of Poland.Walery Eljasz-Radzikowski.

The district ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. It corresponds largely (although not entirely) with today's Spring Garden neighborhood. At the time of its consolidation, it was one of the ten largest cities in the United States. History Spring Garden appears in Varie’s map of 1796 as a small settlement between Vine Street and Buttonwood Lane and a point on a line with Seventh Street, and extending as far west as Ridge Road. There was a street (now known as Franklin Street) which ran north from Vine Street across Callowhill, and stopped opposite a house half-way between Callowhill, and Buttonwood Lane. The Street now known as Eighth Street (then called Garden Street) ran through the centre of the district, and the street now called Darien, formally Garden Street (then called Spring Street) ran from Vine to Buttonwood. The district was incorporated March 22, 1813, as \\"the Commissioners and Inhabitants of the district of Spring Garden.\\" The original boundaries were Vine Street on the south; the middle of Hickory Lane (afterwards Coates Street, now Fairmount Avenue) on the north; Broad Street on; the west, and the middle of Sixth Street on; the east. On March 21, 1827, the district was enlarged by adding; that part of Penn Township beginning at the middle of Sixth Street to a point 210 feet north of the north side of Poplar Lane; thence northwest, parallel to the lane, at a distance of 200 feet from the latter, to the middle of Broad Street; thence parallel with Vine Street to the Schuylkill River. The meaning of this was, that whilst the upper boundary of the district took a course from Sixth Street west by north to Broad Street, the line beyond the latter ran due east and west to the Schuylkill. It extended by the course of that river to Vine Street, and along the latter to Broad, where it met the old district line. By this addition the size of Spring Garden was more than doubled. At the time of consolidation the area of the district was estimated to be 1100 acres (4.5 km²). The former diagonal street, York Avenue, a short section of which survives in Center City, formerly ran from Spring Garden to Fifth Street near Market Street and during the mid 19th Century served as a major commuter route for residents of the Spring Garden District who worked in what was then the central business district of Philadelphia.

It offers elementary, high school, college, post-graduate education. History Don Zacarias Sahagun and Don Melecio Fule founded the Laguna Academy in 1923 to provide secondary schooling to the people of San Pablo City and its neighboring towns. The Laguna Academy, considered the largest provincial private secondary institution in Luzon up to the outbreak of the recent war, was established as a solution to one of the pressing educational problems of the times. In 1923, Don Zacarias Sahagun, seeing the increasing number of poor but ambitious youth of the then town of San Pablo and its vicinities who could not pursue secondary education in the provincial public high school for economic reasons, was moved to action. He conferred with his friend, the late Don Melecio Fule. They pooled their efforts and created the Laguna Academy. The academy began with 16 students and reached an enrollment of 1,500 in 1941. Upon the death of the first two presidents of the board of trustees and co-founders of the institution, Don Melecio Fule and Don Zacarias Sahagun (a municipal president of San Pablo who was responsible for the opening of a town government hospital), one of the academy's alumni in the person of Dr. Nicasio B. Sahagun, physician and educator, took the reins of the school administration in 1938. He and Mr. Alfredo Evangelista, treasurer of the institution, with the moral and material support of the other members of the board exerted much effort in the establishment of a junior normal college, bringing opportunities for higher education nearer the door of every home in San Pablo and the neighboring provinces. The war of 1941, however, forced the closing of the Laguna Academy and it remained closed during the years of the Japanese occupation. With the liberation of the city of San Pablo in 1945, the academy resumed its educational mission. Amid tremendous handicap, for the institution had all its equipment and facilities damaged and its buildings destroyed during the war, the board of trustees reopened the institution. Under its new name, Laguna College, it offers kindergarten, elementary, special science curriculum and RBEC-based high school, college, and graduate school courses which, together, make up a student population of several thousands. In 1996, it was granted Accreditation Status (Level II) for its courses in liberal arts, education, and commerce by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities - Commission on Accreditation (PACU- COA). It was re-accredited Level II in 2005.

It is northwest of Longyearbyen on the west coast, and is the northernmost airport in the world with scheduled public flights. The first airport near Longyearbyen was constructed during World War II. In 1959, it was first used for occasional flights, but could only be used a few months a year. Construction of the new airport at Hotellneset started in 1973, and the airport was opened on 2 September, 1975. It is owned and operated by state- owned Avinor. In 2014, the airport handled 154,261 passengers. Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Tromsø and Oslo in mainland Norway. Lufttransport provides services to the two other airports on Svalbard: Ny- Ålesund and Svea, using Dornier Do 228 turboprop aircraft. There are also regular charter flights. History =Adventdalen= The first airstrip on Svalbard was constructed in Adventdalen, near Longyearbyen, by the Luftwaffe during World War II. This was not used after the war; during the summer the archipelago was served by ships but was completely isolated from November to May. In the early 1950s, the Norwegian Air Force started postal flights using a Catalina aircraft that departed from Tromsø and dropped postal parcels at Bear Island and at Longyearbyen. However, these aircraft never landed until 9 February, 1959, when a resident had become seriously ill and needed to be flown to mainland Norway for treatment. The mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani cleared the runway at Adventsdalen and the 14-hour flight and landing were successful. A second landing, this time for delivery of post, was made on 11 March.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 154 While the Catalina was suitable for postal flights, it was not suitable as a permanent solution for transporting passengers and freight, mainly due to its small size. Store Norske contacted the domestic airline Braathens SAFE for a regular service. A Douglas DC-4 flew the first trial flight on 2 April, 1959, with 54 passengers from Bardufoss Airport. Store Norske had cleared a runway for the aircraft. The next flight occurred in 1962, followed by another in 1963 and two in 1964. Due to lack of runway lights, flights were only permitted during daylight. This hindered flights during parts of December and January when the sun never rises. By April, the runway ice would begin melting as the sun would appear allowing flights during the summer. Navigation was conducted using radio signals from Bear Island and Isfjord.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 155–158 The first night landing was made on 8 December, 1965. A DC-4 took off from the new Tromsø Airport and delivered the mail at Bear Island before continuing to Longyearbyen. The runway was lit up using paraffin lamps and lights from cars parked along the runway. A radio transmitter was also installed at Hotellneset. During the 1965–66 season, Braathens SAFE made 16 flights to Svalbard. The following two seasons, a contract was awarded to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), but after that, the contract reverted to Braathens SAFE. Fred. Olsen Airtransport made its first flight to Svalbard in 1966. By 1969, a total of 50 flights had been made to Svalbard, and by 1972, the 100th was made. By then, Braathens SAFE had started using Douglas DC-6B aircraft. During these years, Store Norske also installed permanent lights. The first jet plane to land in Adventdalen was a Fred Olsen Flyselskap Dassault Falcon 20, LN-FOI. The landing was in 1971, and the aircraft brought in 1700 lbs of mail and passengers, picking up a geological survey party. A Fokker F-28 landed on 29 April, 1972. From 1974, Boeing 737-200C aircraft were taken into use. They had a side cargo door, allowing easy loading of cargo into the main cabin. Braathens SAFE built a small depot with spare parts and up to of fuel. Aeroflot started flights to Adventdalen in 1973 to serve the neighboring Russian community of Barentsburg. =Hotellneset= The tower and hangar The Svalbard Treaty specifies that no military installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities were concerned that a permanent civilian airport could also be used by Norwegian and NATO forces. But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 163 Construction started in 1973. The airport needed to be built on permafrost. The runway is insulated against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heaves due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re- insulated, repairing those areas that previously had been the worst of an acceptable solution. In 2006, this solution was administered to the remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007. =Services= The airport as seen from the fjord Both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession to fly from the mainland to Norway. This was granted to SAS, who would have one weekly service. Braathens SAFE continued to fly charter flights for the Norwegian coal mining company, Store Norske. In this way, the airport was useful until the official opening. The first landing at the new airport was made on 14 September, 1974 with a Fokker F-28, and Braathens SAFE continued to fly until 1 September, 1975. Russian authorities granted a concession for a semi-weekly service by Aeroflot from Murmansk Airport. The first attempt to officially open the airport was made with an SAS Douglas DC-9 on 14 August, 1975. Among the guests on board was King Olav V, but thick fog at Longyearbyen forced the airplane to return. On 1 September, a Fokker F-27 from Braathens SAFE was used to calibrate the runways; on board were pilots from SAS and Aeroflot to learn about the landing conditions. The following day, the second attempt to open the airport was successful. In addition to the scheduled services, Store Norske chartered cargo flights from Fred Olsen Air Transport.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 162–164 Lufttransport has been at the airport since 1976. In 1984, two Bell 212 helicopters were stationed at the airport on contract with the Governor of Svalbard. The company signed an agreement with the Norwegian Coast Guard to have a Partenavia Spartacus planes stationed at Longyearbyen for fishery surveillance. Since 1994, the company has had a Dornier Do 228 stationed at the airport, and two since 2001. Spark+ operated Mil Mi-8 for Arktikugol On 14 August, 1987, Braathens SAFE re-entered the market, flying in parallel with SAS to Tromsø and Oslo. For the first time, the scheduled flights to Oslo were offered as day flights instead of the night flights offered by SAS.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1996: 293–294 In 2002, after SAS bought Braathens, the subsidiary took over all flights to Longyearbyen for the group. From May 2004, they merged to SAS Braathens, that again became SAS from 1 June, 2007. From 1 April to 1 November, 2004, Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced three weekly services from Longyearbyen to Tromsø and Oslo, using Boeing 737-300 aircraft, but the service was terminated due to low loads. A new service was started on 27 March, 2008, with two direct services to Oslo, using larger Boeing 737-800 aircraft. but again the route was terminated later the same year. , Norwegian is again flying to Svalbard from Oslo. Finnair announced plans to begin flights from Helsinki in summer 2016, but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route as it was not in bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway. Norway has decided that from October 2017, Svalbard Airport shall not have international status, meaning that aircraft from other countries than Norway are not permitted anymore.

She survived four major fleet actions against the Allies, but was finally sunk in November 1943 after being damaged through collision with Japanese cruiser . Background The Kagerō-class destroyers were outwardly almost identical to the preceding light cruiser- sized , with improvements made by Japanese naval architects to improve stability and to take advantage of Japan’s lead in torpedo technology. They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun . Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, only one survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Kagero class destroyers Hatsukaze, built at the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation, was laid down on 3 December 1937, launched on 24 January 1939 and commissioned on 15 February 1940. Operational history =Invasions of Southeast Asia= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hatsukaze, was assigned to Destroyer Division 16 (Desdiv 16), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Palau, as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier in the invasion of the southern Philippines and minelayer . In early 1942, Hatsukaze participated in the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting the invasion forces for Menado, Kendari and Ambon in January, and the invasion forces for Makassar, Timor and eastern Java in February. On 27–28 February, Hatsukaze and Desron 2 participated in the Battle of the Java Sea, taking part in a torpedo attack on the Allied fleet. During the month of March, Desron 2 was engaged in anti-submarine operations in the Java Sea. At the end of the month, the squadron escorted the Christmas Island invasion force, then returned to Makassar. At the end of April, Hatsukaze sailed to Kure Naval Arsenal for maintenance, docking on 3 May. On 21 May 1942, Hatsukaze and Desron 2 steamed from Kure to Saipan, where they rendezvoused with a troop convoy and sailed toward Midway Island. Due to the defeat of the Carrier Striking Force and loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the invasion was called off and the convoy withdrew without seeing combat. Desdiv 16 was ordered back to Kure. =Solomon Islands campaign= On 14 July, Hatsukaze and Desdiv 16 were reassigned to Desron 10, Third Fleet. On 16 August, Desron 10 departed Kure, escorting a fleet towards Truk. On 24 August, Desron 10 escorted Admiral Nagumo's Striking Force in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. During September and October, the squadron escorted the fleet patrolling out of Truk north of the Solomon Islands. On 26 October, in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the squadron escorted the Striking Force, then escorted the damaged carriers and into Truk on 28 October. On 4 November, Desron 10 escorted from Truk to Kure, then engaged in training in the Inland Sea, and then escorted Zuikaku from Truk to the Shortland Islands in January 1943. On 10 January, while providing cover for a supply-drum transport run to Guadalcanal, Hatsukaze assisted in sinking the American PT boats PT-43 and PT-112. She suffered heavy damage when struck by a torpedo (possibly launched by PT-112) in the port side; her best speed was 18 knots as she withdrew to Truk, for emergency repairs. Then she sailed to Kure in April for more extensive repairs. In September, Hatsukaze and Desron 10 escorted the battleship from Kure to Truk. In late September and again in late October, Desron 10 escorted the main fleet from Truk to Eniwetok and back again, in response to American carrier airstrikes in the Central Pacific region. Between these two missions, Hatsukaze sortied briefly from Truk in early October 1943 to assist the fleet oiler Hazakaya, which had been torpedoed by an American submarine. =Final battle= On 2 November 1943, while attacking an Allied task force off Bougainville in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, Hatsukaze collided with the cruiser . The collision sheared off her bow, leaving her dead in the water. Hatsukaze and the light cruiser were sunk (at position ) by Allied destroyer gunfire. Of those on board, 164 were killed, including its commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Buichi Ashida. Hatsukaze was removed from the navy list on 5 January 1944.

Soon after he met Hugh Hefner in 1954, Hefner founded Playboy magazine, and Lownes eventually joined his publishing company, serving as vice president. Lownes was a close confidant of Hefner and gained a reputation for dating Playboy Playmates. Lownes headed Playboy Europe and the UK Playboy Clubs from the mid-1960s until his dismissal in the early 1980s. Lownes oversaw Playboy Enterprises's move into casino gambling in the UK in the 1960s, which became Playboy's most successful business other than its publishing until the advent of cable television. He oversaw the most successful part of Hefner's attempt to diversify out of publishing and into motion pictures, hotels and casino gambling. During his time as head of Playboy Europe, he was Britain's highest paid executive, drawing a large salary and eventually becoming Playboy Enterprises's second biggest shareholder. Lownes is credited with creating Playboy Clubs in the United States. Biography =Early life= Victor Aubrey Lownes III was born on April 17, 1928 in Buffalo, New York, the elder son of Victor Aubrey Lownes Jr. and Winifred (Winnie Mark) Lownes, a wealthy couple with ties to the Yale time lock fortune in Buffalo. At the age of 12, his father gave him a cigar to smoke as aversion therapy. At the same age, he also accidentally shot and killed his best friend, which resulted in his forced enrollment at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell. While there, he met Nicky Hilton, Conrad Hilton's son, who became a friend. Lownes matriculated at the University of Chicago in 1944 under the experimental \\"Chicago Plan\\" undergraduate program developed by then-chancellor Robert Maynard Hutchins. He received the program's interdisciplinary A.B. in 1947https://magazine.uchicago.edu/0404/issue/letters.shtml and claimed to have subsequently received an M.B.A. from the Booth School of Business in a now- deleted LinkedIn profile. In 1946, at the age of 18, Lownes wed fellow University of Chicago student Judith Downs. They had two children, Victor \\"Val\\" Aubrey Lownes IV and Meredith Lownes. After several jobs, he found employment at Yale. “I was promoted to manager within a few months,” he would later write, “due solely to hard work, conscientiousness and the fact that my grandfather owned the company.” While he was successful, with a loving wife, two children, a large home, and a good job, he was unsatisfied. Following his father's death, after seven years of marriage he had what in an older man would be called a mid-life crisis. He rebelled against the apparent respectability of the middle class American dream, trapped by marriage and decided to abandon his family. =Playboy= Following the dissolution of his marriage, Lownes returned to Chicago, where he lived for several months entertaining young women. At a party in 1954, Lownes met Hugh Hefner, a man whose almost identical interests had led him to recently create Playboy magazine. Lownes was asked to write a couple of articles, and in November 1955, he was offered a full-time job with the company as Promotions Director. He set about drumming up advertising for the pariah publication, most conservative companies wanting nothing to do with the magazine. He was quite successful in changing minds. Advertising for a club called Gaslight in Chicago, Lownes saw an opportunity to diversify the Playboy brand and suggested to Hefner that Playboy should open a club of its own. Hefner immediately saw the commercial and promotional benefits. Plans for a Playboy Club were begun in 1959. Lownes' then girlfriend suggested to Hefner the idea of dressing the hostesses in the image of the tuxedoed Playboy Bunny character. Hefner took some persuading as he had always viewed the rabbit as a male character but once he saw a prototype of the outfit he changed his mind. Under Lownes' management, the first Playboy Club opened in downtown Chicago on 116 E Walton Street. It was essentially a bar with entertainment featuring Playboy Bunnies serving drinks and performances by some big names in entertainment. The doors opened for the first time on the leap year night of February 29, 1960 and it was an immediate success. More clubs followed in other cities in the United States. =Move to the UK= In 1963, Lownes asked Hefner to send him to London to open the first British Playboy Club. He placed an advertisement in The Times' personal columns that read: \\"American millionaire seeks a flat in the most fashionable part of London. Rents up to £100 a week.\\" He found a house at 3 Montpellier Square, opposite Harrods which he rented for 75 guineas a week. He spent months in London working out how and where to open a club. Gambling had recently been legalized in the UK and Lownes realized there was an opportunity to add the attraction of a casino to the nightclub. A Playboy Club was opened in the heart of the capital, at 45 Park Lane overlooking Hyde Park, on July 1, 1966 and was an immediate success. It was nicknamed the \\"Hutch on the Park.\\" \\"UK One\\", as Lownes became known, easily fitted in with \\"Swinging London\\". Regular parties were thrown at his house; attendees included such London Playboy Club habitués as The Beatles, George Best, Warren Beatty, Michael Caine, Judy Garland, Sean Connery, Terry Southern, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate. In 1967, Lownes moved to 1 Connaught Square, which had previously been the London residence of Mary Augusta Ward, a novelist of the late 19th and early 20th century. (originally published in ) A massive Francis Bacon painting he acquired during this time was judged so hideous that it was exiled to hanging in the hall, while a grandfather clock inside the property was painted by Timothy Leary. =1970s= Lownes's Hertfordshire mansion Stocks House (pictured around 1995) In the 1970s, Playboy magazine encountered competition from a new generation of rival periodicals (most notably Penthouse and Hustler), precipitating a gradual decline in overall profitability. However, gaming profits from the London casino kept rising, making future expansion into gaming very attractive. The Clermont Club in Berkeley Square, known for its celebrity clientele, was purchased in the spring of 1972, while the Manchester and Portsmouth Casino Clubs were opened in 1973. A large rural property a few miles from London was added to the organization in 1972: Stocks House, a 42-room Georgian mansion located outside Aldbury, Hertfordshire, which, coincidentally, had also previously been the country home of Mary Augusta Ward. At the time of Lownes' purchase it had been in use as a girls' boarding school since 1944. As well as being Victor Lownes residence the mansion was used as a training camp for Playboy bunnies and was well known for hosting extravagant parties, including the 1978 25-hour party (to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the founding of Playboy magazine), when guests and Bunny Girls who were given green dots to wear, and were allowed upstairs to Stocks' many bedrooms. Despite rowdy celebrations at Stocks, Lownes became popular with villagers for his support for local charities. With the gaming licence approval for the Victoria Sporting Club in February 1981, Playboy Enterprises became the largest, and, table for table, one of the most profitable gaming operators in the UK. They had three London casinos, two provincial casinos, interests in two others, 72 off track betting parlors, and six bingo parlors. By 1975, Hefner's penchant for becoming involved in various ventures (including the film-oriented Playboy Productions, Playboy Records and the Playboy Press) before losing interest had exacerbated the lack of profitability in many areas of Playboy Enterprises. Lownes was briefly recalled to Chicago by Hefner as a hatchet man to \\"trim the fat\\" off the corporation. He was given virtually unlimited powers; on the job, Lownes was so dedicated to cutting expenses that he was known within the company as \\"Attila\\" or \\"Jaws\\". =Film production= Under the auspices of the fledgling Playboy Productions unit, Lownes was the executive producer for And Now For Something Completely Different (1971), the first Monty Python film. He was a fan and proposed the idea of a film specifically designed to introduce the British comedy troupe to a U.S. audience. He was very egotistical. According to Terry Gilliam, Lownes insisted on getting an animated executive producer credit equal in size to those of the group members. Gilliam refused and so Lownes had the credit made elsewhere at his own cost. Gilliam then created a different style of credit for the Pythons so Lownes' credit is the only one that appears in this way. In their later film, Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982), Gilliam burlesqued the incident by giving one Python a credit name three times the size of anyone else's: \\"MICHAEL PALIN – as the man with the biggest credit\\". Lownes was out partying with Roman Polanski when Sharon Tate was murdered by the Manson family in August 1969. Later, Lownes persuaded Hefner to provide $1,500,000 to finance Polanski's film Macbeth (1971) through Playboy Productions when no other movie studio would touch it. Polanski proceeded to go $600,000 over budget and then mock Playboy's generosity. Lownes terminated his friendship with Polanski over his behavior. Angrily, he returned a cherished gift to Polanski, the life-sized gold penis Polanski had modeled for during happier days. Lownes wrote that \\"I'm sure you'll have no difficulty finding some friend you can shove it up\\". =Downfall= By 1981, Lownes was back in London, serving as senior vice president at Playboy Enterprises with a portfolio encompassing the profitable casinos. He was leading the effort to open up Atlantic City, New Jersey for gambling from his London base. Work was started on the future Atlantic City casino building. However, Lownes was accused of irregularities by the Gaming Board for Great Britain as the project progressed. Hefner panicked, firing Lownes before his scheduled meeting with the committee in an obvious attempt to save the New Jersey deal. Without him, the company's British gaming licence was revoked and Playboy lost their most valuable assets. Additionally, Playboy's temporary gaming license in Atlantic City was not renewed. Playboy, which made $31 million in the year ending June 30, 1981, lost more than $51 million in the year ending June 30, 1982. With the loss of its gaming assets, Playboy barely survived. In 1990, Hefner and Lownes reconciled after a nine- year estrangement.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/victor-lownes- playboy-magazine-executive.html =After Playboy= Lownes himself suffered little more than wounded pride. He had accumulated a fortune during his years as Britain's best paid executive and he still had his wife, Marilyn Cole, whose affections he and Hefner had both attempted to gain. Marilyn was the first full frontal Playboy Playmate of the Month, in January 1972, and the Playmate of the Year 1973. She continued to pose for Playboy until 1984, and became a journalist who has written for The Observer, Esquire and GQ. During this period, Lownes invested in several successful West End theatre productions, including Other People's Money and Stomp. Lownes also reconciled with Polanski following his dismissal. During the Roman Polanski libel case against Vanity Fair in July 2005, Lownes was ill and could not attend the trial. His wife came in his place. Lownes was rarely seen in public in his latter years. Death Lownes died on January 11, 2017 at the age of 88 from a heart attack in London.

Despite being \\"distinguished as the first non-violent 3D shooter\\" by the Philadelphia Daily News, prior examples of non-violent first-person shooters have existed on the market a few years before Extreme Paintbrawl was released, namely Super 3D Noah's Ark by Christian video game developer Wisdom Tree and Chex Quest, an advergame total conversion of Doom for children. Gameplay In Extreme Paintbrawl, there are three game modes available to the player: Season Mode, Single Game, and Practice. Season Mode allows the player to manage a team of eight recruits through an entire season. The player is able to hire and fire recruits, buy markers, and compete against other teams for the championship in compliance with a fixed schedule. There were several flaws in this mode, such as the inability to swap markers between recruits. Single Game allows the player to play a single paintball match. The objective is to score by either capturing the opponent's flag or marking an opponent. Practice mode leaves the player alone on their chosen field with no specific targets to shoot. Reception Extreme Paintbrawl received extremely negative reviews; criticism was directed toward its use of the obsolete Build engine, lack of game modes beyond a variation of capture the flag, maps that did not resemble actual paintball fields at all, an unfitting soundtrack, and a practice mode that only allowed players to roam through a map without any enemies or targets. The game was also plagued by bizarre AI behavior, including computer-controlled teammates getting caught near doors and walls or standing still in open areas of the map, but also being able to also exhibit perfect aim. GameSpot gave Extreme Paintbrawl a 1.7/10, stating that the game took the first-person shooter genre too far by trying to \\"wed a tired game engine with the paintball phenomenon.\\" Its AI was criticized for being \\"perhaps one of the worst attempts at modeling a team sport\\" due to its inconsistent behavior, and the game was also criticized for making it too difficult to distinguish between enemies and allies. In conclusion, Extreme PaintBrawl was considered to be \\"perhaps one of the worst games I've seen in years, as much out of touch with reality as it is out of step with the gaming world at large.\\" IGN gave Extreme Paintbrawl a 0.7/10, making it the second lowest score IGN has ever given to a video game. The review remarked that the soundtrack was the only aspect of the entire game that could constitute being described as \\"extreme\\".  Sequels  The game spawned a number of sequels. Extreme Paintbrawl 2 was released for Microsoft Windows on November 15, 1999. The game was developed and published by Head Games. The game uses a modified version of the Genesis3D engine. The game was criticised for its AI, as the player's teammates constantly run into walls and get stuck anywhere possible. IGN gave the game a score of 2.6/10.IGN: Extreme Paintbrawl 2 Review Extreme Paintbrawl 4 was developed by Cat Daddy Games and published by Activision Value. It was released on May 13, 2002. It was a re-release of Ultimate Paintbrawl 3. The game received negative reviews due to outdated graphics and a broken multiplayer mode.

He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944 together with Alfred Wetzler, at the height of the Holocaust, and for having co-written with him a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there.. The report reached George Mantello in Switzerland almost two months after it arrived in Budapest. It was obtained from Moshe Krausz in Budapest by Romanian diplomat Florian Manilou who gave it to Mantello. Mantello immediately publicized a summary of the report, which led to large scale grass roots protests in Switzerland against the atrocities, to masses about the fate of Jews and about 400 headlines about the genocide. Mantello and the Swiss people are credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving more than 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba trained as a biochemist, working mostly in England and Canada.Ritchie, Méabh (22 January 2015). \\"The man who revealed the horror of Auschwitz to the world\\". The Daily Telegraph. \\"Rudolf Vrba Memorial Lecture 2014\\", University of British Columbia, 21 March 2014. Vrba and fellow escapee Alfréd Wetzler fled Auschwitz three weeks after German forces invaded Hungary and shortly before the SS began mass deportations of Hungary's Jewish population to the camp. The information the men dictated to Jewish officials when they arrived in Slovakia on 24 April 1944, which included that new arrivals in Auschwitz were being gassed and not \\"resettled\\" as the Germans maintained, became known as the Vrba–Wetzler report.. When the War Refugee Board published it with considerable delay in November 1944, the New York Herald Tribune described it as \\"the most shocking document ever issued by a United States government agency\\". While it confirmed material in earlier reports from Polish and other escapees, the historian Miroslav Kárný wrote that it was unique in its \\"unflinching detail\\".. There was a delay of several weeks before the report was distributed widely enough to gain the attention of governments. Mass transports of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz began on 15 May 1944 at a rate of 12,000 people a day.. Most went straight to the gas chambers. Vrba argued until the end of his life that the deportees might have refused to board the trains, or at least that their panic would have disrupted the transports, had the report been distributed widely and sooner.; . From late June and into July 1944, material from the Vrba–Wetzler report appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the United States and Europe, particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy to halt the deportations.. On 2 July American and British forces bombed Budapest, and on 6 July, in an effort to exert his sovereignty, Horthy ordered that the deportations should end. By then, over 434,000 Jews had been deported in 147 trains—almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside—but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.  Early life and arrest  Vrba at school (front row, fourth left), Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, 1935–1936 Vrba was born Walter Rosenberg in Topoľčany, Czechoslovakia (part of Slovakia from 1993), one of three boys and a girl to Helena Rosenberg, née Gruenfeldová, and her husband, Elias. Vrba's mother was from Zbehy;. his maternal grandfather, Bernat Grünfeld, an Orthodox Jew from Nitra, was killed in the Majdanek concentration camp.. Vrba took the name Rudolf Vrba after his escape from Auschwitz.. The Rosenbergs owned a steam sawmill in Jaklovce and lived in Trnava.. In September 1941 the Slovak Republic (1939–1945)—a client state of Nazi Germany—passed a \\"Jewish Codex\\", similar to the Nuremberg Laws, which introduced restrictions on Jews' education, housing and travel.; The government set up transit camps at Nováky, Sereď and Vyhne. Jews were required to wear a yellow badge and live in certain areas, and available jobs went first to non-Jews. When Vrba was excluded, at age 15, from the gymnasium (high school) in Bratislava as a result of the restrictions, he found work as a labourer and continued his studies at home, particularly chemistry, English and Russian.. He met his future wife, Gerta Sidonová, around this time; she had also been excluded from school.. Vrba wrote that he learned to live with the restrictions but rebelled when the Slovak government announced, in February 1942, that thousands of Jews were to be deported to \\"reservations\\" in German-occupied Poland.. The deportations came at the request of Germany, which needed the labour; the Slovak government paid the Germans RM 500 per Jew on the understanding that the government would lay claim to the deportees' property. Around 800 of the 58,000 Slovakian Jews deported between March and October 1942 survived. Vrba blamed the Slovak Jewish Council for having cooperated with the deportations.; . Insisting that he would not be \\"deported like a calf in a wagon\\", he decided to join the Czechoslovak Army in exile in England and set off in a taxi for the border, aged 17, with a map, a box of matches, and the equivalent of £10 from his mother.. After making his way to Budapest, Hungary, he decided to return to Trnava but was arrested at the Hungarian border. The Slovak authorities sent him to the Nováky transit camp; he escaped briefly but was caught. An SS officer instructed that he be deported on the next transport.  Majdanek and Auschwitz  =Majdanek= Majdanek concentration camp, 2008 Vrba was deported from Czechoslovakia on 15 June 1942 to the Majdanek concentration camp in Lublin, German-occupied Poland,. where he briefly encountered his older brother, Sammy. They saw each other \\"almost simultaneously and we raised our arms in brief salute\\"; it was the last time he ever saw him.. He also encountered \\"kapos\\" for the first time: prisoners appointed as functionaries, one of whom he recognized from Trnava. Most wore green triangles, signalling their category as \\"career criminals\\": Vrba's head and body were shaved, and he was given a uniform, wooden shoes and a cap. Caps had to be removed whenever the SS came within three yards. Prisoners were beaten for talking or moving too slowly. At roll call each morning, prisoners who had died during the night were piled up behind the living. Vrba was given a job as a builder's labourer.. When a kapo asked for 400 volunteers for farm work elsewhere, Vrba signed up, looking for a chance to escape. A Czech kapo who had befriended Vrba hit him when he heard about this; the kapo explained that the \\"farm work\\" was in Auschwitz.. =Auschwitz I= Auschwitz I, 2008 On 29 June 1942, the Reich Security Head Office transferred Vrba and the other volunteers to Auschwitz I,. the main camp (Stammlager) in Oświęcim, a journey of over two days. Vrba considered trying to escape from the train, but the SS announced that ten men would be shot for every one who went missing.. On his second day in Auschwitz, he watched as prisoners threw bodies onto a cart, stacked in piles of ten, \\"the head of one between the legs of another to save space\\".. The following day he and 400 other men were beaten into a cold shower in a shower room built for 30, then marched outside naked to register. He was tattooed on his left forearm as no. 44070 and given a striped tunic, trousers, cap and wooden shoes.; for the prisoner number, also see . After registration, which took all day and into the evening, he was shown to his barracks, an attic in a block next to the main gate and the Arbeit macht frei sign.. Young and strong, Vrba was \\"purchased\\" by a kapo, Frank, in exchange for a lemon (sought after for its vitamin C) and assigned to work in the SS food store. This gave him access to soap and water, which helped to save his life. Frank, he learned, was a kind man who would pretend to beat his prisoners when the guards were watching, although the blows always missed.. The camp regime was otherwise marked by its pettiness and cruelty. When Heinrich Himmler visited on 17 July 1942 (during which he watched a gassing), the inmates were told everything had to be spotless.; for Himmler's visit, also see . As the prison orchestra assembled by the gate for Himmler's arrival, the block senior and two others starting beating an inmate because he was missing a tunic button: =Auschwitz II= \\"Kanada\\" commando \\"Kanada\\" barracks, c. May 1944 In August 1942 Vrba was reassigned to the Aufräumungskommando (\\"clearing-up\\") or \\"Kanada\\" commando, in Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp, 4 km (2.5 miles) from Auschwitz I. Around 200–800 prisoners worked on the nearby Judenrampe where freight trains carrying Jews arrived, removing the dead, then sorting through the new arrivals' property. Many brought kitchen utensils and clothes for different seasons, suggesting to Vrba that they believed the stories about resettlement. It took 2–3 hours to clear out a train, by which time most new arrivals were dead.. Those deemed fit for work were selected for slave labour and the rest taken by truck to the gas chamber.. Vrba estimated that 90 percent were gassed. He told Claude Lanzmann in 1978 that the process relied on speed and making sure no panic broke out, because panic meant the next transport would be delayed.. \\"Selection\\" of Hungarian Jews, Auschwitz II- Birkenau, May/June 1944 The new arrivals' property was taken to barracks known as Effektenlager I and II in Auschwitz I (moved to Auschwitz II after Vrba's escape). Inmates, and apparently also some of the camp administration, called the barracks Kanada I and II because they were a \\"land of plenty\\".; . Everything was there—medicine, food, clothing, and cash—much of it repackaged by the Aufräumungskommando to be sent to Germany.. The Aufräumungskommando lived in Auschwitz I, block 4, until 15 January 1943 when they were transferred to block 16 in Auschwitz II, sector Ib, where Vrba lived until June 1943.; . After he had been in Auschwitz for about five months, he fell sick with typhus; his weight dropped to 42 kilos and he was delirious. At his lowest point, he was helped by Josef Farber, a Slovakian member of the camp resistance, who brought him medication and thereafter extended to him the protection of the Auschwitz underground.. Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the extermination camp In early 1943 he was given the job of assistant registrar in one of the blocks; he told Lanzmann that the resistance movement had manoeuvered him into the position because it gave him access to information.; . A few weeks later, in June, he was made registrar (Blockschreiber) of block 10 in Auschwitz II, the quarantine section for men (BIIa), again because of the underground.; ; ; ; . The position gave him his own room and bed, and he could wear his own clothes. He was also able to speak to new arrivals who had been selected to work, and he had to write reports about the registration process, which allowed him to ask questions and take notes.; . Estimates of numbers killed From his room in BIIa, Vrba said he could see the trucks drive towards the gas chambers.; . In his estimate, 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed.. During his time on the Judenrampe from 18 August 1942 to 7 June 1943, he told Lanzmann in 1978, he had seen at least 200 trains arrive, each containing 1,000–5,000 people.. In a 1998 paper, he wrote that he had witnessed 100–300 trains arrive, each locomotive pulling 20–40 freight cars and sometimes 50–60. He calculated that, between the spring of 1942 and 15 January 1944, 1.5 million had been killed.. According to the Vrba–Wetzler report, 1,765,000 were killed in Auschwitz between April 1942 and April 1944.; . In 1961 Vrba swore in an affidavit for the trial of Adolf Eichmann that he believed 2.5 million had died overall in the camp, plus or minus 10 percent.; . Vrba's estimates are higher than those of Holocaust historians but in line with estimates from SS officers and Auschwitz survivors, including members of the Sonderkommando. Early estimates ranged from one to 6.5 million. Rudolf Höss, the first Auschwitz commandant, said in 1946 that three million had died in the camp, although he revised his view. In 1946 the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland estimated four million. Later scholarly estimates were lower. According to Polish historian Franciszek Piper, writing in 2000, most historians place the figure at one to 1.5 million. His own widely accepted estimate was that at least 1.3 million were sent to Auschwitz and at least 1,082,000 died (rounded up to 1.1 million or 85 percent), including 960,000 Jews. Piper's estimate of the death toll for April 1942 to April 1944 was 450,000,, citing Piper, Franciszek (1993). Die Zahl der Opfer von Auschwitz. Oswiecim: Verlag Staatliches Museum in Oswiecim, tables D, 29 and 31. against Vrba's 1,765,000.. Hungarian Jews Rough ground plan of Auschwitz II, showing the area under construction, from the Vrba–Wetzler report (1944) According to Vrba, a kapo from Berlin by the name of Yup told him on 15 January 1944 that he was part of a group of prisoners building a new railway line to lead straight to the crematoria. Yup said he had overheard from an SS officer that a million Hungarian Jews would soon arrive and that the old ramp could not handle the numbers. A railway line leading directly to the crematoria would cut thousands of truck journeys from the old ramp.. In addition Vrba heard directly, courtesy of drunk SS guards, he wrote, that they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Dutch Jews arrived, they brought cheese; likewise there were sardines from the French Jews, and halva and olives from the Greeks. Now it was Hungarian salami.; also see ; . Vrba had been thinking of escape for two years but, he wrote, he was now determined, hoping to \\"undermine one of the principle foundations—the secrecy of the operation\\".. A Russian captain, Dmitri Volkkov, told him he would need Russian tobacco soaked in petrol, then dried, to fool the dogs; a watch to use as a compass; matches to make food; and salt for nutrition.. Vrba began studying the layout of the camps. Both Auschwitz I and II consisted of inner camps where the prisoners slept, surrounded by a six-yard-wide trench of water, then high-voltage barbed-wire fences. The area was lit at night and guarded by the SS in watch towers. When a prisoner was reported missing, the guards searched for three days and nights. The key to a successful escape would be to remain hidden just outside the inner perimeter until the search was called off.. His first escape was planned for 26 January 1944 with Charles Unglick, a French Army captain, but the rendezvous did not work out; Unglick tried to escape alone and was killed. The SS left his body on display for two days, seated on a stool.. An earlier group of escapees had been killed and mutilated with dumdum bullets, then placed in the middle of Camp D with a sign reading \\"We're back!\\". Czech family camp German camps in occupied Poland On 6 March 1944 Vrba heard that the Czech family camp was about to be sent to the gas chambers.. The group of around 5,000, including women and children, had arrived in Auschwitz in September 1943 from the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic since 1993). That they had been allowed to live in Auschwitz for six months was unusual, not least because women with children were usually killed immediately. Correspondence found after the war between Adolf Eichmann's office and the International Red Cross suggested that the Germans had set up the family camp as a model for a planned Red Cross visit to Auschwitz.. The group was housed in relatively good conditions in block BIIb near the main gate, although in the six months they were held there 1,000 died despite the better treatment.; . They did not have their heads shaved, and the children were given lessons and access to better food, including milk and white bread.. On 1 March, according to the Vrba–Wetzler report (5 March, according to Danuta Czech), the group was asked to write postcards to their relatives, telling them they were well and asking for parcels of provisions, and to postdate the cards to 25–27 March.; . On 7 March, according to the report (8–9 March, according to Czech), the group of 3,791 was gassed.; . The report stated that 11 twins had been kept alive for medical experiments.. On 20 December 1943, a second Czech family group of 3,000 arrived, according to the report (2,473, according to Czech).; . Vrba assumed that this group would also be killed after six months, i.e. around 20 June 1944.; . =Escape= Alfréd Wetzler Vrba resolved again to escape. In Auschwitz he had encountered an acquaintance from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no. 29162, then aged 26) who had arrived on 13 April 1942 and was working in the mortuary.; ; for Wetzler's prisoner number, see and . For the date of Wetzler's arrival, see For more on prisoner numbers, see Czesław Mordowicz, who escaped from Auschwitz weeks after Vrba, said decades later that it was Wetzler who had initiated and planned the escape. According to Wetzler, writing in his book Čo Dante nevidel (1963), later published as Escape from Hell (2007), the camp underground had organized the escape, supplying information for Vrba and Wetzler to carry (\\"Karol\\" and \\"Val\\" in the book). \\"Otta\\" in Hut 18, a locksmith, had created a key for a small shed in which Vrba and others had drawn a site plan and dyed clothes. \\"Fero\\" from the central registry supplied data from the registry; \\"Filipek\\" (Filip Müller) in Hut 13 added the names of the SS officers working around the crematoria, a plan of the gas chambers and crematoria, his records of the transports gassed in crematoria IV and V, and the label of a Zyklon B canister.; . \\"Edek\\" in Hut 14 smuggled out clothes for the escapees to wear, including suits from Amsterdam. \\"Adamek\\", \\"Bolek\\" and Vrba had supplied socks, underpants, shirts, a razor and a torch, as well as glucose, vitamins, margarine, cigarettes and a cigarette lighter that said \\"made in Auschwitz\\". The information about the camp, including a sketch of the crematorium produced by a Russian prisoner, \\"Wasyl\\", was hidden inside two metal tubes. The tube containing the sketch was lost during the escape; the second tube contained data about the transports. Vrba's account differs from Wetzel's; according to Vrba, they took no notes and wrote the Vrba–Wetzler report from memory., citing Wetzler, Alfréd (as Jozef Lánik) (1964). Čo Dante nevidel. Bratislava: Osveta, 177. Also see , citing notes from Wetzler in APMO (Auschwitz Museum archives) and personal correspondence with Vrba. He told the historian John Conway that he had used \\"personal memotechnical methods\\" to remember the data, and that the stories about written notes had been invented because no one could explain his ability to recall so much detail., citing personal correspondence with Conway in 1984. Gestapo telegram reporting the escape, 8 April 1944 Wearing suits, overcoats, and boots, at 14:00 on Friday, 7 April 1944—the eve of Passover—the men climbed inside a hollowed-out space they had prepared in a pile of wood stacked between Auschwitz-Birkenau's inner and outer perimeter fences, in section BIII in a construction area known as \\"Meksyk\\" (\\"Mexico\\"). They sprinkled the area with Russian tobacco soaked in gasoline, as advised by Dmitri Volkov, the Russian captain.; ; ; . Bolek and Adamek, both Polish prisoners, moved the planks back in place once they were hidden.; ; . Kárný writes that at 20:33 on 7 April SS-Sturmbannführer Fritz Hartjenstein, the Birkenau commander, learned by teleprinter that two Jews were missing.. On 8 April the Gestapo at Auschwitz sent telegrams with descriptions to the Reich Security Head Office in Berlin, the SS in Oranienburg, district commanders, and others. The men hid in the wood pile for three nights and throughout the fourth day.. Soaking wet, with strips of flannel tightened across their mouths to muffle coughing, Wetzel wrote that they lay there counting: \\"[N]early eighty hours. Four thousand eight hundred minutes. Two hundred and eighty-eight thousand seconds.\\" On the Sunday morning, 9 April, Adamek urinated against the pile and whistled to signal that all was well. At 9 pm on 10 April, they crawled out of the wood pile. \\"Their circulation returns only slowly,\\" Wetzel wrote. \\"They both have the sensation of ants running along in their veins, that their bodies have been transformed into big, very slowly warming ant-heaps. ... The onset of weakness is so fierce that they have to support themselves on the inner edges of the panels.\\" Using a map they'd taken from \\"Kanada\\", the men headed south toward Slovakia away, walking parallel to the Soła river..  Vrba–Wetzler report  = Walking to Slovakia = According to Henryk Świebocki of the Auschwitz- Birkenau State Museum, local people, including members of the Polish underground who lived near the camp, did what they could to help escapees.. Vrba wrote that there was no organized help for them on the outside. At first the men moved only at night, eating bread they'd taken from Auschwitz and drinking water from streams. On 13 April, lost in Bielsko-Biala, they approached a farmhouse and a Polish woman took them in for a day. Feeding them bread, potato soup and ersatz coffee, she explained that most of the area had been \\"Germanized\\" and that Poles helping Jews risked death.; also see ; . They continued following the river; every so often, a Polish woman would drop half a loaf of bread near them. They were shot at on 16 April by German gendarmes but managed to lose them. Two other Poles helped them with food and a place to stay, until they finally crossed the Polish–Slovakian border near Skalité on 21 April 1944.; . By this time, Vrba's feet were so swollen he had had to cut off his boots and was wearing carpet slippers one of the Polish peasants had given him.. A peasant family in Skalité took them in for a few days, fed and clothed them, then put them in touch with a Jewish doctor in nearby Čadca, Dr. Pollack. Vrba and Pollack had met in a transit camp in Nováky.; . Through a contact in the Slovak Jewish Council, Pollack arranged for them to send people from Bratislava to meet the men.; for the Jewish Council, see and . Pollack was distressed to learn the probable fate of his parents and siblings, who had been deported from Slovakia to Auchwitz in 1942.. =Meeting with the Jewish Council= Vrba and Wetzler spent the night in Čadca in the home of a relative of the rabbi Leo Baeck, before being taken to Žilina by train. They were met at the station by Erwin Steiner, a member of the Slovak Jewish Council (or Ústredňa Židov), and taken to the Jewish Old People's Home, where the council had offices. Over the following days, they were introduced to Ibolya Steiner, who was married to Erwin; Oskar Krasniansky, an engineer and stenographer (who later took the name Oskar Isaiah Karmiel);. and, on 25 April, the chair of the council, Dr. Oskar Neumann, a lawyer.; ; ; . The council was able to confirm who Vrba and Weltzer were from its deportation lists. In his memoir, Wetzler described (using pseudonyms) several people who attended the first meeting: a lawyer (presumably Neumann), a factory worker, a \\"Madame Ibi\\" (Ibolya Steiner) who had been a functionary in a progressive youth organization, and the Prague correspondent of a Swiss newspaper. Neumann told them the group had been waiting two years for someone to confirm the rumours they had heard about Auschwitz. Wetzler was surprised by the naïvety of his question: \\"Is it so difficult to get out [of] there?\\" The journalist wanted to know how they had managed it, if it was so hard. Wetzler felt Vrba lean forward angrily to say something, but he grabbed his hand and Vrba drew back. Wetzler encouraged Vrba to start describing conditions in Auschwitz. \\"He wants to speak like a witness,\\" Wetlzer wrote, \\"nothing but facts, but the terrible events sweep him along like a torrent, he relives them with his nerves, with every pore of his body, so that after an hour he is completely exhausted.\\" The group, in particular the Swiss journalist, seemed to have difficulty understanding. The journalist wondered why the International Red Cross had not intervened. \\"The more [Vrba] reports, the angrier and more embittered he becomes.\\" The journalist asked Vrba to tell them about \\"specific bestialities by the SS men\\". Vrba replied: \\"That is as if you wanted me to tell you of a specific day when there was water in the Danube.\\" Vrba described the ramp, selection, the Sonderkommando, and the camps' internal organization; the building of Auschwitz III and how Jews were being used as slave labour for Krupp, Siemens, IG Farben, and DAW; and the gas chambers.; . Wetzler gave them the data from the central registry hidden in the remaining tube, and described the high death toll among Soviet POWs, the destruction of the Czech family camp, the medical experiments, and the names of doctors involved in them. He also handed over the label from the Zyklon B canister. Every word, he wrote, \\"has the effect of a blow on the head\\". Neumann said the men would be brought a typewriter in the morning, and the group would meet again in three days. Hearing this, Vrba exploded: \\"Easy for you to say 'in three days'! But back there they are flinging people into the fire at this moment and in three days they'll kill thousands. Do something immediately!\\" Wetzler pulled on his arm, but Vrba continued, pointing at each one: \\"You, you, you'll all finish up in the gas unless something is done! Do you hear?\\" =Writing the report= The following day, Vrba began by sketching the layout of Auschwitz I and II, and the position of the ramp in relation to the camps. The report was re-written several times over three days; according to Wetzler, on two of those days, he and Vrba wrote until daybreak. Wetzler wrote the first part, Vrba the third, and they worked on the second part together. Then they re-wrote it six times. Oskar Krasniansky translated it from Slovak into German as it was being written, with the help of Ibolya Steiner, who typed it up. The original Slovak version is lost., citing Oswiecim, hrobka štyroch miliónov ľudí (\\"Auschwitz, the tomb of four million\\"), 1946, and personal correspondence with Alfred Wetzler, 14 April 1982; Ibolya Steiner is also referred to as Gisela Steiner. For Krasniansky preparing it in German and Steiner typing it up, also see , citing \\"Statement by Krasznyansky. The Hebrew University. The Institute of Contemporary Jewry. Oral History Division, Catalog No. 3, 1970, p. 120, No. 410 S.E., Protocol in Czech, pp. 10 and 13.\\" The report in Slovak and, it seems, in German was completed by Thursday, 27 April 1944.; . According to Kárný, the report describes the camp \\"with absolute accuracy\\", including its construction, installations, security, the prisoner number system, the categories of prisoner, the diet and accommodation, as well as the gassings, shootings and injections. It provides details known only to prisoners, including that discharge forms were filled out for prisoners who were gassed, indicating that death rates in the camp were actively falsified. Although presented by two men, it was clearly the product of many prisoners, including the Sonderkommando working in the gas chambers.; also see . It contains sketches of the gas chambers and states that there were four crematoria, each of which contained a gas chamber and furnace room.. The report estimated the total capacity of the gas chambers to be 6,000 daily.. Layout of the crematoria in Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Vrba–Wetzler report In a sworn deposition for the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Vrba said that he and Wetzler had obtained the information about the gas chambers and crematoria from Sonderkommando Filip Müller and his colleagues who worked there. Müller confirmed this in his Eyewitness Auschwitz (1979).; . Auschwitz scholar Robert Jan van Pelt wrote in 2002 that the description contains errors, but that given the circumstances, including the men's lack of architectural training, \\"one would become suspicious if it did not contain errors\\".. Distribution and publication = Rosin and Mordowicz escape = The Jewish Council found an apartment for Vrba and Wetzler in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, Slovakia, where the men kept a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report, in Slovak, hidden behind a picture of the Virgin Mary. They made clandestine copies with the help of a friend, Josef Weiss of the Bratislava Office for the Prevention of Venereal Disease, and handed them out to Jews in Slovakia with contacts in Hungary, for translation into Hungarian.; . According to historian Zoltán Tibori Szabó, the report was first published in Geneva in May 1944, in German, by Abraham Silberschein of the World Jewish Congress as Tatsachenbericht über Auschwitz und Birkenau, dated 17 May 1944.. Florian Manoliu of the Romanian Legation in Bern took the report to Switzerland and gave it to George Mantello, a Jewish businessman from Transylvania, who was working as the first secretary of the El Salvador consulate in Geneva. It was thanks to Mantello that the report received, in the Swiss press, its first wide coverage.. Hungarian Jews arriving at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, May/June 1944 Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (prisoner no. 84216) escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, the day of the Normandy landings. Hearing about the invasion of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.; . Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed, on 17 June, by Oskar Krasniansky, the engineer who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Auschwitz II-Birkenau and that most had been killed on arrival.. Vrba concluded from this that the Hungarian Jewish Council had not informed its Jewish communities about the Vrba–Wetzler report.; . The seven-page Rosin-Mordowicz report was combined with the longer Vrba–Wetzler report and a third report, known as the Polish Major's report (written by Jerzy Tabeau, who had escaped from Auchwitz in November 1943), to become the Auschwitz Protocols.; for Tabeau, also see . According to David Kranzler, Mantello asked the Swiss-Hungarian Students' League to make 50 mimeographed copies of the Vrba–Wetzler report and the two shorter Auschwitz reports, which by 23 June 1944 he had distributed to the Swiss government and Jewish groups. On or around 19 June Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, who had received a copy of the report from Mantello, cabled the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem to say they knew \\"what has happened and where it has happened\\" and that 12,000 Jews were being deported from Budapest daily. He also reported the Vrba–Wetzler figure that 90 per cent of Jews arriving at Auschwitz II were being killed.; . The Swiss students made thousands of copies, which were passed to other students and MPs.. At least 383 articles about Auschwitz appeared in the Swiss press between 23 June and 11 July 1944.; . According to Michael Fleming, that figure \\"exceeds the number of articles published about the Holocaust during the entire war in The Times, the Daily Telegraph, the Manchester Guardian and the whole of the British popular press\\". =Importance of dates= The dates on which the report was distributed became a matter of importance within Holocaust historiography. According to Randolph L. Braham, Jewish leaders were slow to distribute the report, fearful of causing panic.. Braham asks: \\"Why did the Jewish leaders in Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland and elsewhere fail to distribute and publicize the Auschwitz Reports immediately after they had received copies in late April or early May 1944?\\". Vrba alleged that lives were lost because of this. In particular he blamed Rudolf Kastner of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee.; ; also see and . The committee had organized safe passage for Jews into Hungary before the German invasion.. The Slovakian Jewish Council handed Kastner the report at the end of April or by 3 May 1944 at the latest. Reverend József Éliás, head of the Good Shepherd Mission in Hungary, said he received the report from Géza Soós, a member of the Hungarian Independence Movement, a resistance group.; for more on Soos, see . Yehuda Bauer believes that Kastner or Otto Komoly, leader of the Aid and Rescue Committee, gave Soós the report.. Éliás's secretary, Mária Székely, translated it into Hungarian and prepared six copies, which made their way to Hungarian and church officials, including Miklós Horthy's daughter-in-law, Countess Ilona Edelsheim-Gyulai.; also see ; . Braham writes that this distribution occurred before 15 May.. Kastner's reasons for not distributing the report further are unknown. According to Braham, \\"Hungarian Jewish leaders were still busy translating and duplicating the Reports on June 14–16, and did not distribute them till the second half of June. [They] almost completely ignored the Reports in their postwar memoirs and statements.\\". Vrba argued until the end of his life that Rudolf Kastner withheld the report in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. As the Vrba–Wetzler report was being written, Eichmann had proposed to the Committee in Budapest that the SS trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but Kastner collected donations to pay the SS to allow over 1,600 Jews to leave Budapest for Switzerland on what became known as the Kastner train. In Vrba's view, Kastner suppressed the report in order not to alienate the SS.; also see ; . The Hungarian biologist George Klein worked as a secretary for the Hungarian Jewish Council in Síp Street, Budapest, when he was a teenager. In late May or early June 1944, his boss, Dr. Zoltán Kohn, showed him a carbon copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report in Hungarian and said he should tell only close family and friends.. For sources discussing Klein and Vrba, see ; . Klein had heard Jews mention the term Vernichtungslager (extermination camp), but it had seemed like a myth. \\"I immediately believed the report because it made sense,\\" he wrote in 2011. \\" ... The dry, factual, nearly scientific language, the dates, the numbers, the maps and the logic of the narrative coalesced into a solid and inexorable structure.\\". Klein told his uncle, who asked how Klein could believe such nonsense: \\"I and others in the building in Síp Street must have lost our minds under the pressure.\\" It was the same with other relatives and friends: middle-aged men with property and family did not believe it, while the younger ones wanted to act. In October that year, when the time came for Klein to board a train to Auschwitz, he ran instead.. =News coverage= Details from the Vrba–Wetzler report began to appear elsewhere in the media. On 4 June 1944 the New York Times reported on the \\"cold-blooded murder\\" of Hungary's Jews.\\"Senators appeal on Hungary's Jews; Foreign Relations Committee Pleads With People to Stop 'Cold-Blooded Murder'\\". The New York Times. 4 June 1944, 4. Daniel, E. C. (4 June 1944). \\"Pole Says Nazis Plan Slave Town: Reports 75,000-Acre Plot in Poland Even Contains Permanent Factories\\". The New York Times, 6. On 16 June the Jewish Chronicle in London ran a story by Isaac Gruenbaum of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem with the headline \\"Bomb death camps\\"; the writer had clearly seen the Vrba–Wetzler report.. Also on 16 June the BBC World Service reported in Germany, on its women's programme at noon, the murder in March of the Czech family camp and the second Czech group the Vrba–Wetzler report said would be killed around 20 June.. The broadcast alluded to the Vrba–Wetzler report: A 22-line story on page five of the New York Times, \\"Czechs report massacre\\", reported on 20 June that 7,000 Jews had been \\"dragged to gas chambers in the notorious German concentration camps at Birkenau and Oświęcim [Auschwitz]\\".; \\"Czechs Report Massacre; Claim the Nazis Killed 7,000 in Prison Gas Chambers\\". The New York Times. 20 June 1944, 5. Walter Garrett, the Swiss correspondent of the Exchange Telegraph, a British news agency, sent four dispatches to London on 24 June with details from the report received from George Mantello, including Vrba's estimate that 1,715,000 Jews had been murdered. As a result of his reporting, at least 383 articles about Auschwitz appeared over the following 18 days, including a 66-page report in Geneva, Les camps d'extermination. On 26 June the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that 100,000 Hungarian Jews had been executed in gas chambers in Auschwitz. The BBC repeated this on the same day but omitted the name of the camp.. The following day, as a result of the information from Walter Garrett, the Manchester Guardian published two articles. The first said that Polish Jews were being gassed in Auschwitz and the second: \\"Information that the Germans systematically exterminating Hungarian Jews has lately become more substantial.\\" The report mentioned the arrival \\"of many thousands of Jews ... at the concentration camp at Oswiecim\\".; On 28 June the newspaper reported that 100,000 Hungarian Jews had been deported to Poland and gassed, but without mentioning Auschwitz. Daniel Brigham, the New York Times correspondent in Geneva, published a story on 3 July, \\"Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps\\", with the subtitle \\"1,715,000 Jews Said to Have Been Put to Death by the Germans up to April 15\\", and on 6 July a second, \\"Two Death Camps Places of Horror; German Establishments for Mass Killings of Jews Described by Swiss\\".. Brigham, Daniel T. (3 July 1944). \\"Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps; 1,715,000 Jews Said to Have Been Put to Death by the Germans Up to April 15\\". The New York Times, 3. Brigham, Daniel T. (6 July 1944). \\"Two Death Camps Places of Horror; German Establishments for Mass Killings of Jews Described by Swiss\\". The New York Times, 6. According to Fleming, the BBC Home Service mentioned Auschwitz as an extermination camp for the first time on 7 July 1944. It said that over \\"four hundred thousand Hungarian Jews [had been] sent to the concentration camp at Oświęcim\\" and that most were killed in gas chambers; it added that the camp was the largest concentration camp in Poland and that gas chambers had been installed in 1942 that could kill 6,000 people a day. Fleming writes that the report was the last of nine on the 9 pm news.. =Meetings with Martilotti and Weissmandl= same map with WWII borders At the request of the Slovakian Jewish Council,. Vrba and Czesław Mordowicz (one of the 27 May escapees), along with a translator and Oskar Krasniasnky, met Vatican Swiss legate Monsignor Mario Martilotti at the Svätý Jur monastery on 20 June 1944.; also see ; . Martilotti had seen the report and questioned the men about it for five hours.. Mordowicz was irritated by Vrba during this meeting. In an interview in the 1990s for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, he said Vrba, 19 at the time, had behaved cynically and childishly; at one point he appeared to mock the way Martilotti was cutting his cigar. Mordowicz feared that the behaviour would make their information less credible. To maintain Martilotti's attention, he told him that Catholics and priests were being murdered along with the Jews. Martilotti reportedly fainted, shouting \\"Mein Gott! Mein Gott!\\" Five days later, Pope Pius XII sent a telegram appealing to Miklós Horthy.. Also at the Jewish Council's request, Vrba and Mordowicz met Michael Dov Weissmandl, an Orthodox rabbi and one of the leaders of the Bratislava Working Group, at his Yeshiva in the centre of Bratislava. Vrba writes that Weissmandl was clearly well-informed and had seen the Vrba–Wetzler report. He had also seen, as Vrba found out after the war, the Polish Major's Report about Auschwitz.. Weissmandl asked what could be done. Vrba explained: \\"The only thing to do is to explain ... that they should not board the trains ...\\".. He also suggested bombing the railway lines into Birkenau. (Weissmandl had already suggested this, on 16 May 1944, in a message to the American Orthodox Jewish Rescue committee.). Vrba wrote about the incongruity of visiting Weissmandl at his Yeshiva, which he assumed was under the protection of the Slovak government and the Germans. \\"The visibility of Yeshiva life in the center of Bratislava, less than 150 miles south of Auschwitz, was in my eyes a typical piece of Goebbels–inspired activity .... There—before the eyes of the world—the pupils of Rabbi Weissmandel could study the rules of Jewish ethics while their own sisters and mothers were being murdered and burned in Birkenau.\\". =Deportations halted= Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy ordered an end to the deportations on 6 July 1944. Several appeals were made to Horthy, including by the Spanish, Swiss and Turkish governments, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gustaf V of Sweden, the International Committee of the Red Cross and, on 25 June 1944, Pope Pius XII.; for Gustav V, Red Cross, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey, see . The Pope's telegram did not mention Jews: \\"We are being beseeched in various quarters to do everything in our power that, in this noble and chivalrous nation, the sufferings, already so heavy, endured by a large number of unfortunate people, because of their nationality or race, may not be extended and aggravated.\\" John Clifford Norton, a British diplomat in Bern, cabled the British government on 27 June with suggestions for action, which included bombing government buildings in Budapest. On 2 July American and British forces did bomb Budapest, killing 500. and dropping leaflets warning that those responsible for the deportations would be held to account.. Horthy ordered an end to the mass deportations on 6 July, \\"deeply impressed by Allied successes in Normany\\", according to Randolph Braham,. and anxious to exert his sovereignty over the Germans in the face of threats of a pro-German coup.. According to Raul Hilberg, Horthy may also have been worried about information cabled by the Allies in Bern to their governments at the request of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee, informing them of the deportations. The cables were intercepted by the Hungarian government, which may have feared that its own members would be held responsible for the murders.. =War Refugee Board publication= The Vrba–Wetzler report received widespread coverage in the United States and elsewhere when, after many months delay, John Pehle of the US War Refugee Board issued a 25,000-word press release on 25 November 1944, along with a full version of the report and a preface calling it \\"entirely credible\\".. Entitled The Extermination Camps of Auschwitz (Oświęcim) and Birkenau in Upper Silesia, the release included the 33-page Vrba–Wetzler report; a six-page report from Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz, who escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944; and the 19-page Polish Major's report, written in December 1943 by a Polish escapee, Jerzy Tabeau. Jointly the three came to be known as the Auschwitz Protocols.. The Washington Times Herald said the press release was \\"the first American official stamp of truth to the myriad of eyewitness stories of the mass massacres in Poland\\",. while the New York Herald Tribune called the Protocols \\"the most shocking document ever issued by a United States government agency\\". Pehle passed a copy to Yank magazine, an American armed-forces publication, but the story, by Sergeant Richard Paul, was turned down as \\"too Semitic\\"; the magazine did not want to publish it, they said, because of \\"latent antisemitism in the Army\\".; . In June 1944 Pehle had urged John J. McCloy, US assistant secretary of war, to bomb Auschwitz, but McCloy had said it was \\"impracticable\\". After the publication of the Protocols he tried again. McCloy replied that the camp could not be reached by bombers stationed in France, Italy or the UK, which meant that heavy bombers would have to fly to Auschwitz, a journey of 2,000 miles, without an escort. McCloy told him: \\"The positive solution to this problem is the earliest possible victory over Germany.\\".  After the report  = Resistance activities = After dictating the report in April 1944, Vrba and Wetzler stayed in Liptovský Mikuláš for six weeks, and continued to make and distribute copies of the report with the help of a friend, Joseph Weiss. Weiss worked for the Office for Prevention of Venereal Diseases in Bratislava and allowed copies to be made in the office.. The Jewish Council gave Vrba papers in the name of Rudolf Vrba, showing Aryan ancestry going back three generations, and supported him financially to the tune of 200 Slovak crowns a week, equivalent to an average worker's salary; Vrba wrote that it was \\"sufficient to sustain me underground in Bratislava\\".; . On 29 August 1944 the Slovak Army rose up against the Nazis and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia was announced. Vrba joined the Slovak partisans in September 1944 and was later awarded the Czechoslovak Medal of Bravery.. Auschwitz was liberated by the 60th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front (part of the Red Army) on 27 January 1945; 1,200 prisoners were found in the main camp and 5,800 in Birkenau. The SS had tried to destroy the evidence, but the Red Army found what was left of four crematoria, as well as 5,525 pairs of women's shoes, 38,000 pairs of men's, 348,820 men's suits, 836,225 items of women's clothing, large numbers of carpets, utensils, toothbrushes, glasses and dentures, and seven tons of hair.. = Marriage and education = In 1945 Vrba met up with a childhood friend, Gerta Sidonová from Tvrnava. They both wanted to study for degrees, so they took courses set up by Czechoslovakia's Department of Education for those who had missed out on schooling because of the Nazis. They moved after that to Prague, where they married in 1947; Sidonová took the surname Vrbová, the female version of Vrba. She graduated in medicine, then went into research. In 1949 Vrba obtained a degree in chemistry (Ing. Chem.) from the Czech Technical University in Prague, which earned him a postgraduate fellowship from the Ministry of Education, and in 1951 he received his doctorate (Dr. Tech. Sc.) for a thesis entitled \\"On the metabolism of butyric acid\\". The couple had two daughters: Helena (1952–1982) and Zuzana (b. 1954). Vrba undertook post-doctoral research at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, where he received his C.Sc. in 1956. From 1953 to 1958 he worked for Charles University Medical School in Prague. His marriage ended around this time.. =Defection to Israel, move to England= With the marriage over and Czechoslovakia ruled by a Soviet Union-dominated socialist government, Vrba and Vrbová both defected, him to Israel and her to England with the children. Vrbová had fallen in love with an Englishman and was able to defect after being invited to an academic conference in Poland. Unable to obtain visas for her children, she returned illegally to Czechoslovakia and walked her children back over the mountains to Poland. From there they flew to Denmark with forged papers, then to London.. In 1957 Vrba became aware, when he read Gerald Reitlinger's The Final Solution (1953), that the Vrba–Wetzler report had been distributed and had saved lives; he had heard something about this in or around 1951, but Reitlinger's book was the first confirmation.. The following year he received an invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected too. For the next two years, he worked at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot.Barkat, Amiram (2 April 2006). \\"Death camp escapee Vrba dies at 82\\", Haaretz. He said later that he had not been able to continue living in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966. Testimony =Trial of Adolf Eichmann= Adolf Eichmann during his trial in Jerusalem, 1961 On 11 May 1960 Adolf Eichmann was captured by the Mossad in Buenos Aires and taken to Jerusalem to stand trial. (He was sentenced to death in December 1961.) Vrba was not called to testify because the Israeli Attorney General had apparently wanted to save the expense.\\"The Trial of Adolf Eichmann, Session 109. The Nizkor Project, Part 4 of 4. Because Auschwitz was in the news, Vrba contacted the Daily Herald in London, and one of their reporters, Alan Bestic, wrote up his story, which was published in five installments over one week, beginning on 27 February 1961 with the headline \\"I Warned the World of Eichmann's Murders.\\"; . In July 1961 Vrba submitted an affidavit to the Israeli Embassy in London, stating that, in his view, 2.5 million had died in Auschwitz, plus or minus 10 percent.. =Trial of Robert Mulka, book publication= Vrba testified against Robert Mulka of the SS at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, telling the court that he had seen Mulka on the Judenrampe at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The court found that Vrba \\"made an excellent and intelligent impression\\" and would have been particularly observant at the time because he was planning to escape. It ruled that Mulka had indeed been on the ramp, and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.. Following the Herald articles, Bestic helped to write Vrba's memoir, I Cannot Forgive (1963), also published as Factory of Death (1964). Bestic's writing style was criticized; reviewing the book, Mervyn Jones wrote in 1964 that it has the flavour of \\"the juicy bit on page 63\\".Jones, Mervyn (9 February 1964). \\"Survivors from Hell\\". The Observer. Erich Kulka criticized the book in 1985 for minimizing the role played by the other three escapees (Wetzler, Mordowicz and Rosin); Kulka also disagreed with Vrba regarding his criticism of Zionists, the Slovak Jewish Council, and Israel's first president. The book was published in German (1964), French (1988), Dutch (1996), Czech (1998) and Hebrew (1998). It was republished in English in 1989 as 44070: The Conspiracy of the Twentieth Century and in 2002 as I Escaped from Auschwitz.. = Move to Canada, Claude Lanzmann interview = Vrba moved to Canada in 1967, where he worked for the Medical Research Council of Canada from 1967 to 1973, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1972. From 1973 to 1975 he was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, where he met his second wife, Robin Vrba, originally from Fall River, Massachusetts.Dion, Marc Munroe (11 March 2015). \\"Holocaust survivor's widow, a Fall River native, speaks at BCC\\". The Herald News. They married in 1975 and returned to Vancouver, where she became a real-estate agent and he an associate professor of pharmacology at the University of British Columbia. He worked there until the early 1990s, publishing over 50 research papers on the chemistry of the brain, diabetes, and cancer.Martin, Douglas (7 April 2006). \\"Rudolf Vrba, 82, Auschwitz Witness, Dies\\". The New York Times; . Claude Lanzmann interviewed Vrba in November 1978, in New York's Central Park, for Lanzmann's nine-and-a-half-hour documentary on the Holocaust, Shoah (1985); the interview is available on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHHM).. The film was first shown in October 1985 at the Cinema Studio in New York. A quote from Vrba's interview is inscribed on a USHMM exhibit: =Trial of Ernst Zündel= Vrba testified in January 1985, along with Raul Hilberg, at the seven-week trial in Toronto of the German Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel. Zündel's lawyer, Doug Christie, tried to undermine Vrba (and three other survivors) by requesting ever more detailed descriptions, then presenting any discrepancy as significant. According to Lawrence Douglas, when Vrba said he had watched bodies burn in a pit, Christie asked how deep the pit had been; when Vrba described an SS officer climbing onto the roof of a gas chamber, Christie asked about the height and angle. When Vrba told Christie he was not willing to discuss his book unless the jury had read it, the judge reminded him not to give orders. Christie argued that Vrba's knowledge of the gas chambers was secondhand. According to Vrba's deposition for Adolf Eichmann's trial in 1961, he obtained information about the gas chambers from Sonderkommando Filip Müller and others who worked there, something that Müller confirmed in 1979. Christie asked whether he had seen anyone gassed. Vrba replied that he had watched people being taken into the buildings and had seen SS officers throw in gas canisters after them: \\"Therefore, I concluded it was not a kitchen or a bakery, but it was a gas chamber. It is possible they are still there or that there is a tunnel and they are now in China. Otherwise, they were gassed.\\" The trial ended with Zündel's conviction for knowingly publishing false material about the Holocaust. In R v Zundel (1992), the Supreme Court of Canada upheld Zundel's appeal on free-speech grounds. =Meeting with George Klein= George Klein In 1987 the Swedish–Hungarian biochemist George Klein travelled to Vancouver to thank Vrba; he had read the Vrba–Wetzler report in 1944 as a teenager in Budapest and escaped because of it. He wrote about the meeting in an essay, \\"The Ultimate Fear of the Traveler Returning from Hell\\", for his book Pietà (1992).. The traveller's ultimate fear, English scholar Elana Gomel wrote in 2003, was that he had seen Hell but would not be believed; in this case, the traveller knows something that \\"cannot be put into any human language\\".. Despite the significant influence Vrba had on Klein's life, Klein's first sight of Vrba was the latter's interview in Shoah in 1985. He disagreed with Vrba's allegations about Kastner; Klein had seen Kastner at work in the Jewish Council offices in Budapest, where Klein had worked as a secretary, and he viewed Kastner as a hero. He told Vrba how he had tried himself, in the spring of 1944, to convince others in Budapest of the Vrba–Wetzler report's veracity, but no one had believed him, which inclined him to the view that Vrba was wrong to argue that the Jews would have acted had they known about the death camps. Vrba said that Klein's experience illustrated his point: distributing the report via informal channels had lent it no authority.. Klein asked Vrba how he could function in the pleasant, provincial atmosphere of the University of British Columbia, where no one had any concept of what he had been through. Vrba told him about a colleague who had seen him in Lanzmann's film and asked whether what the film had discussed was true. Vrba replied: \\"I do not know. I was only an actor reciting my lines.\\" \\"How strange,\\" the colleague replied. \\"I didn't know that you were an actor. Why did they say that film was made without any actors?\\". Klein wrote: =Death= Vrba's fellow escapee, Alfréd Wetzler, died in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 8 February 1988. Wetzler was the author of Escape From Hell: The True Story of the Auschwitz Protocol (2007), first published as Čo Dante nevidel (1963) under the pseudonym Jozef Lánik. Vrba died of cancer, aged 81, on 27 March 2006 in hospital in Vancouver. He was survived by his first wife, Gerta Vrbová; his second wife, Robin Vrba; his daughter, Zuza Vrbová Jackson; and his grandchildren, Hannah and Jan. He was pre-deceased by his elder daughter, Dr. Helena Vrbová, who died in 1982 in Papua New Guinea during a malaria research project. Robin Vrba made a gift of Vrba's papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in New York.  Reception  = Documentaries, books, annual walk = Claude Lanzmann interviewed Vrba in 1978 for the documentary Shoah (1985) Several documentaries have told Vrba's story, including Genocide (1973), directed by Michael Darlow for ITV in the UK; Auschwitz and the Allies (1982), directed by Rex Bloomstein and Martin Gilbert for the BBC; and Claude Lanzmann's Shoah. Vrba was also featured in Witness to Auschwitz (1990), directed by Robin Taylor for the CBC in Canada; Auschwitz: The Great Escape (2007) for the UK's Channel Five; and Escape From Auschwitz (2008) for PBS in the United States. George Klein, the Hungarian-Swedish biologist who read the Vrba–Wetzler report in Budapest as a teenager, and who escaped rather than board a train to Auschwitz, wrote about Vrba in his book Pietà (MIT Press, 1992). In 2001 Mary Robinson, then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Vaclav Havel, then President of the Czech Republic, established the \\"Rudy Vrba Award\\" for films in the \\"right to know\\" category about unknown heroes.\\"2010 One World International Human Rights Awards announced—IPHR director on Jury\\". IPHR. In 2014 the Vrba–Weztler Memorial began organizing an annual 130-km, five-day walk from the \\"Mexico\\" section of Auschwitz, where the men hid for three days, to Žilina, Slovakia, following the route they took. In January 2020 a PBS film Secrets of the Dead: Bombing Auschwitz presented a reconstruction of Vrba's escape, with David Moorst as Vrba and Michael Fox as Wetzler.\\"PBS Presents “Secrets of the Dead: Bombing Auschwitz\\". The Jewish Voice, 24 January 2020. = Scholarship = Vrba's place in Holocaust historiography was the focus of Ruth Linn's Escaping Auschwitz: A Culture of Forgetting (Cornell University Press, 2004). The Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies at the City University of New York held an academic conference in April 2011 to discuss the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports, resulting in a book, The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary (Columbia University Press, 2011), edited by Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel.\\"International Conference on the Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary\\", Rosenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (CUNY), and the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, 6–7 April 2011. In 2014 the British historian Michael Fleming reappraised the impact of the Vrba–Wetzler report in Auschwitz, the Allies and Censorship of the Holocaust (Cambridge University Press, 2014).. = Awards = Martin Gilbert The University of Haifa awarded Vrba an honorary doctorate in 1998 at the instigation of Ruth Linn, with support from Yehuda Bauer. For having fought during the Slovak National Uprising, Vrba was awarded the Czechoslovak Medal for Bravery, the Order of Slovak National Insurrection (Class 2), and the Medal of Honor of Czechoslovak Partisans. In 2007 he received the Order of the White Double Cross, 1st class, from the Slovak government.\\"Holders of the Order of the 1st Class White Double Cross\\", State Honours, Slovak Republic. British historian Martin Gilbert supported an unsuccessful campaign in 1992 to have Vrba awarded the Order of Canada. The campaign was supported by Irwin Cotler, the former Attorney General of Canada, who at the time was a professor of law at McGill University. Similarly, Bauer proposed unsuccessfully that Vrba be awarded an honorary doctorate from the Hebrew University. Disputes =About Hungarian Jews= Vrba stated that warning the Hungarian community was one of the motives for his escape. His statement to that effect was first published on 27 February 1961, in the first installment of a five-article series about Vrba by a journalist, Alan Bestic, for the Daily Herald in England. In the second installment the next day, Vrba described having overheard the SS say they were looking forward to Hungarian salami, a reference to the provisions Hungarian Jews were likely to carry.. Vrba said that in January 1944 a kapo had told him the Germans were building a new railway line to bring the Jews of Hungary directly into Auschwitz II.; . The Czech historian Miroslav Kárný noted that there is no mention of Hungarian Jews in the Vrba–Wetzler report.. Randolph L. Braham also questioned Vrba's later recollections.. The Vrba–Wetzler report said only that Greek Jews were expected: \\"When we left on April 7, 1944 we heard that large convoys of Greek Jews were expected.\\". It also said: \\"Work is now proceeding on a still larger compound which is to be added later on to the already existing camp. The purpose of this extensive planning is not known to us.\\"; . In 1946 Dr. Oskar Neumann, head of the Jewish Council in Slovakia, whose interviews with Vrba and Wetzler in April 1944 helped to form the Vrba–Wetzler report, wrote in his memoir Im Schatten des Todes (published in 1956). that the men had indeed mentioned Hungarian salami to him during the interviews: \\"These chaps did also report that recently an enormous construction activity had been initiated in the camp and very recently the SS often spoke about looking forward to the arrival of Hungarian salami.\\" Vrba wrote that the original Slovak version of the Vrba–Wetzler report, some of which he wrote by hand, may have referred to the imminent Hungarian deportations. That version of the report did not survive; it was the German translation that was copied. Vrba had argued strongly for the inclusion of the Hungarian deportations, he wrote, but he recalled Oskar Krasniansky, who translated the report into German, saying that only actual deaths should be recorded, not speculation. He could not recall which argument prevailed.. Alfred Wetzler's memoirs, Escape from Hell (2007), also say that he and Vrba told the Slovakian Jewish Council about the new ramp, the expectation of half a million Hungarian Jews, and the mention of Hungarian salami. =Attorney-General v. Gruenwald= It was a source of distress to Vrba for the rest of his life that the Vrba–Wetzler report had not been distributed widely until June–July 1944, weeks after his escape in April. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz, most killed on arrival.. In his view, the deportees boarded the trains in the belief they were being sent to some kind of Jewish reservation.. Arguing that the deportees would have fought or run had they known the truth, or at least that panic would have slowed the transports, Vrba alleged that Rudolf Kastner of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee (who had a copy of the Vrba–Wetzler report by 3 May 1944 at the latest) had held back the report to avoid jeopardizing complex, and mostly futile, negotiations with Adolf Eichmann and other SS officers to exchange Jews for money and goods.; ; . In taking part in these negotiations, Vrba argued, the SS was simply placating the Jewish leadership to avoid rebellion within the community.. In I Cannot Forgive (1963), Vrba drew attention to the 1954 trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, a Hungarian Jew living in Israel. In 1952 Gruenwald accused Rudolf Kastner, who had become a civil servant in Israel, of having collaborated with the SS so that he could escape from Hungary with a select few, including his family. Kastner had bribed the SS to allow over 1,600 Jews to leave Hungary for Switzerland on the Kastner train in June 1944, and he had testified on behalf of leading SS officers, including Kurt Becher, at the Nuremberg trials. Vrba agreed with Gruenwald's criticism of Kastner. In Attorney-General of the Government of Israel v. Malchiel Gruenwald, the Israeli government sued Gruenwald for libel on Kastner's behalf. In June 1955, Judge Benjamin Halevi decided mostly in Gruenwald's favour, ruling that Kastner had \\"sold his soul to the devil\\".; ; . \\"Masses of ghetto Jews boarded the deportation trains in total obedience,\\" Halevi wrote, \\"ignorant of the real destination and trusting the false declaration that they were being transferred to work camps in Hungary.\\" The Kastner train had been a pay-off, the judge said, and the protection of certain Jews had been \\"an inseparable part of the maneuvers in the 'psychological war' to destroy the Jews\\". Kastner was assassinated in Tel Aviv in March 1957; the verdict was partly overturned by the Supreme Court of Israel in 1958.; ; . =Criticism of Jewish Councils= Adolf Eichmann In addition to blaming Kastner and the Hungarian Aid and Rescue Committee for having failed to distribute the Vrba–Wetzler report, Vrba criticized the Slovakian Jewish Council for having failed to resist the deportation of Jews from Slovakia in 1942. When he was deported from Slovakia to the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland in June that year, the Jewish Council had known, he alleged, that Jews were being killed in Poland, but they did nothing to warn the community and even assisted by drawing up lists of names.. He referred to Jewish leaders in Slovakia and Hungary as \\"quislings\\" who were essential to the smooth running of the deportations: \\"The creation of Quislings, voluntary or otherwise, was, in fact, an important feature of Nazi policy\\" in every occupied country, in his view.; ; . The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer argued that while the Council knew that being sent to Poland meant severe danger for Jews, at that stage they did not know about the Final Solution It is true, Bauer wrote, that Jewish Council members, under Karol Hochberg, head of the council's \\"department for special tasks\\", had worked with the SS, offering secretarial and technical help to draw up lists of Jews to be deported (lists supplied by the Slovak government). But other members of the Jewish Council warned Jews to flee and later formed a resistance, the Working Group, which in December 1943 took over the Jewish Council, with Oskar Neumann (the lawyer who helped to organize the Vrba–Wetzler report) as its leader. Vrba did not accept Bauer's distinctions. =Responses= Yehuda Bauer Vrba's position that the Jewish leadership in Hungary and Slovakia betrayed their communities was supported by the Anglo-Canadian historian John S. Conway, a colleague of his at the University of British Columbia, who from 1979 wrote a series of papers in defence of Vrba's views.; ; ; ; . In 1996 Vrba repeated the allegations in an article, \\"Die mißachtete Warnung: Betrachtungen über den Auschwitz-Bericht von 1944\\" (\\"The warning that was ignored: Considerations of an Auschwitz report from 1944\\") in Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, to which the Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer responded in 1997 in the same journal. Bauer responded to Conway in 2006.; also see ; }. In Bauer's opinion, Vrba's \\"wild attacks on Kastner and on the Slovak underground are all a-historical and simply wrong from the start\\", although he acknowledged that many survivors share Vrba's view., citing a letter from Yehuda Bauer to Ben Ami, translator of Vrba's memoir. By the time the Vrba–Wetzler report had been prepared, Bauer argued, it was too late for anything to alter the Nazis' deportation plans.; . Bauer expressed the view that Hungarian Jews knew about the mass murder in Poland even if they did not know the particulars; and if they had seen the Vrba–Wetzler report, they would have been forced onto the trains anyway.. In response, Vrba alleged that Bauer was one of the Israeli historians who, in defence of the Israeli establishment, had downplayed Vrba's place in Holocaust historiography.; for a response, see . The British historian Michael Fleming argued in 2014 against the view that Hungarian Jews had sufficient access to information. After the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944, the British government's Political Warfare Executive (PWE) directed the BBC's Hungarian Service to run Allied warnings to the Hungarian government that \\"racial persecution will be regarded as a war crime\\".. But on 13 April the PWE decided against broadcasting warnings directly to Hungarian Jews on the grounds that it would \\"cause unnecessary alarm\\" and that \\"they must in any case be only too well-informed of the measures that may be taken against them\\".. Fleming writes that this was a mistake: the Germans had tricked the Jewish community into thinking they were being sent to Poland to work. The first mention of extermination camps in the PWE's directives to the BBC's Hungarian Service came on 8 June 1944.. Randolph L. Braham Randolph L. Braham, a specialist in the Holocaust in Hungary, agreed that Hungarian Jewish leaders did not keep the Jewish communities informed or take \\"any meaningful precautionary measures\\" to deal with the consequences of a German invasion. He called this \\"one of the great tragedies of the era\\". Nevertheless, it remains true, he argued, that by the time the Vrba–Wetzler report was available, the Jews of Hungary were in a helpless state: \\"marked, hermetically isolated, and expropriated\\". In northeastern Hungary and Carpatho-Ruthenia, the women, children and elderly were living in crowded ghettos, in unsanitary conditions and with little food, while the younger men were in military service in Serbia and the Ukraine. There was nothing they could have done to resist, he wrote, even if they had known about the report. Vrba was criticized in 2001 in a collection of articles in Hebrew, Leadership under Duress: The Working Group in Slovakia, 1942–1944, by a group of Israeli activists and historians, including Bauer, with ties to the Slovak community. The introduction, written by a survivor, refers to the \\"bunch of mockers, pseudo-historians and historians\\" who argue that the Bratislava Working Group collaborated with the SS, a \\"baseless\\" allegation that ignores the constraints under which the Jews in Slovakia and Hungary were living. Vrba (referred to as \\"Peter Vrba\\") is described as \\"the head of these mockers\\", although the introduction makes clear that his heroism is \\"beyond doubt\\". It concludes: \\"We, Czechoslovakian descendants, who personally experienced [the war] cannot remain silent in face of these false accusations.\\", citing Amir, Giora (2001). \\"Introduction\\", in Bauer, Yehuda; Yablonka, Hanna; Jelinek, Y.; Akiva, N.; Fatran, Gila; Frider, E.; Conway, John; Rothkirchen, Livia; Spitzer, J. Leadership under Duress: The Working Group in Slovakia, 1942–1944. Kibbutz Dalia: Maarechet, 11–12 (Hebrew) = Vrba's place in Holocaust historiography= In Vrba's view, Israeli historians tried to erase his name from Holocaust historiography because of his views about Kastner and the Hungarian and Slovak Jewish Councils, some of whom went on to hold prominent positions in Israel. When Ruth Linn first tried to visit Vrba in British Columbia, he practically \\"chased her out of his office\\", according to Uri Dromi in Haaretz, saying he had no interest in \\"your state of the Judenrats and Kastners\\". Linn wrote in her book about Vrba, Escaping Auschwitz: A Culture of Forgetting (2004), that Vrba's and Wetzler's names had been omitted from Hebrew textbooks or their contribution minimized: standard histories refer to the escape by \\"two young Slovak Jews\\", \\"two chaps\\", and \\"two young men\\", and represent them as emissaries of the Polish underground in Auschwitz.. Dr. Oskar Neumann of the Slovak Jewish Council referred to them in his memoir as \\"these chaps\\"; Oskar Krasniansky, who translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German, mentioned them only as \\"two young people\\" in his deposition for the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. There was also a tendency to refer to the Vrba–Wetzler report as the Auschwitz Protocols, which is a combination of the Vrba–Wetzler and two other reports. The 1990 edition of the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, published by Yad Vashem in Israel, did name Vrba and Wetzler, but in the 2001 edition they are \\"two Jewish prisoners\\".. Vrba's memoir was not translated into Hebrew until 1998, 35 years after its publication in English. As of that year, there was no English or Hebrew version of the Vrba–Wetzler report at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, an issue the museum attributed to lack of funding. There was a Hungarian translation, but it did not note the names of its authors and, Linn wrote, could be found only in a file that dealt with Rudolf Kastner.. Linn herself, born and raised in Israel and schooled at the prestigious Hebrew Reali School, first learned about Vrba when she watched Claude Lanzmann's film Shoah (1985).. In 1998 she polled 594 students at the University of Haifa, either third-year undergraduates or first-year graduate students; 98 percent said that no one had ever escaped from Auschwitz, and the remainder did not know the escapees' names.. This failure to acknowledge Vrba has played into the hands of Holocaust deniers, who have tried to undermine his testimony about the gas chambers.. In 2005 Uri Dromi of the Israel Democracy Institute responded that there were at least four Israeli books on the Holocaust that mention Vrba, and that Wetzler's testimony is recounted at length in Livia Rothkirchen's Hurban yahadut Slovakia (\\"The Destruction of Slovak Jewry\\"), published by Yad Vashem in 1961.

Males make a \\"reeeek\\" call from grasses, vegetation, or ground around the water body from April through to September. This call is characteristic of the trilling frog clade that is present in the genus Pseudacris. This clade is so named because the call of each individual is different, each having its own series of pulses. Within the trilling frog clade, they are further divided into \\"dynamic\\" and \\"static\\" groups, and recent studies have placed P. maculata into the static grouping. The static grouping is distinguished by a lack of variability in one's call and the ability to somewhat control the direction of their calls. Amphibians' songs or calls to one another are commonly used for sexual selection, but in Bee, et al. 2010, the researchers found no correlation that linked directly to sexual selection. They found a link between the lowest note in the song and body size, but insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions from it. Every call was different in the study, but the differences were subtle and required complex technology to pick up. The similarity in the calls results in the frogs not being able to distinguish individuals from each other. It was hypothesized that the calls were simply to broadcast their position to other calling males telling them to stay away and also to alert females to the presence of a male that is ready to mate. This is normally one of the first species of amphibian to emerge in spring. It comes out so early that it is often found while snow and ice are still present. This timing directly correlates with snow-melt and the water level of the water body that the populations calls home.Corn, Paul Stephen, and Erin Muths (2002). \\"Variable breeding phenology affects the exposure of amphibian embryos to ultraviolet radiation.\\" Ecology 83(11): 2958-2963. Pseudacris maculata is categorized as an annual breeder. Breeding takes place once the weather begins to warm, typically from late February to around April. After mating, a single female can lay anywhere from 500-1500 eggs, with a highly variable hatching rate of anywhere from 37% to 87%.The life cycle continues with tadpoles metamorphosing around June or July. The metamorphosis survival rate also has a massive range of 10-100% in the wild.  Threats  Amphibians are widely known as very important species in their ecosystems, but declines are occurring worldwide in amphibian populations. There are multiple reasons that amphibians decline, with the most common being disease, habitat loss, over harvesting for food, pet trade, and competition with invasive species. Climate change has also been one of the proposed mechanisms for why this species is struggling .Amburgey, Staci, et al. (2012). \\"Effects of hydroperiod duration on survival, developmental rate, and size at metamorphosis in boreal chorus frog tadpoles (Pseudacris maculata).\\" Herpetologica 68(4): 456-467. Climate change is causing the weather to become increasingly dry, which affects most amphibians (including Pseudacris maculata). This change leads them to modify their behavior based on the environmental conditions and sometimes exposing them to conditions that are not optimal. This dry weather has another effect on this species, it results in lower water levels, which exposes the amphibians and their eggs (which are laid in the water) to more extreme temperatures. This, coupled with the decrease in ozone layers, also exposes the amphibians and the eggs to heightened levels of UV radiation when compared to environments with deeper waters. The boreal chorus frog has an interesting defense to invasive species. This species of frog has been found to have cultural learning on how to behave towards predators. Cultural learning is learning that takes place by an individual observing and imitating behaviors of other individuals in close proximity. The example brought up by Ferrari and Chivers 2008, is how P. maculata tadpoles learn to avoid salamanders from tadpoles that have experience with the predator. The paper discusses how if a new predator is added to the environment, there is a learning curve at how long it takes the tadpoles to learn to avoid the new predator.Ferrari, Maud CO, and Douglas P. Chivers (2008). \\"Cultural learning of predator recognition in mixed-species assemblages of frogs: the effect of tutor-to-observer ratio.\\" Animal Behaviour 75(6): 1921-1925. The addition of an invasive species will be very successful until the tadpoles learn to avoid it, which could cause even more pressure on this species. Amphibians worldwide are being infected with the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and the boreal chorus frog is no exception. Bd infects the keratinized skin of its host, which results in an inability to properly osmoregulate through the skin. The symptoms to this disease vary between species, ranging from seemingly unaffected to death. This species of frog has been found to be infected at higher frequencies than other amphibians in the same environments.7\\\\. Rodriguez, Edmarie Martinez et al. (2009). \\"Presence of Batrachochytrium Dendrobatidis at the Headwaters of the Mississippi River, Itasca State Park, Minnesota, USA.\\" Herpetological Review 40(1): 48–50. Print. There have been many studies examining how this species copes with an infection of Bd. Some studies claim that Pseudacris maculata is struggling (8),Seburn, David C., Kari Gunson, and Frederick W. Schueler (2014). \\"Apparent widespread decline of the Boreal Chorus Frog (Pseudacris maculata) in eastern Ottawa.\\" The Canadian Field-Naturalist 128(2): 151-157. while others show that populations are maintaining themselves. This is especially intriguing when one considers that the boreal chorus frog can have mortality up to 80% when infected with Bd. No definitive conclusions can be drawn with how Pseudacris maculata copes with the disease within a population. Bd is an especially interesting and dangerous pathogen given the fact that it can persist in an environment even in the absence of amphibians. It can survive in water for an extended amount of time, as well as attach to feathers.Wixson, Joel G., and Kevin B. Rogers (2009). \\"Detecting Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in the wild when amphibians are absent.\\" Herpetological Review 40(3): 313. These facts, on top of the fact that Bd can also infect salamanders and frogs in all stages of life result in the pathogen persisting in an environment long enough to continually infect new frogs (9,11).Davidson, Elizabeth W., et al. (2003). \\"Pathogenicity and transmission of chytridiomycosis in tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum).\\" Copeia 2003(3): 601-607. Tadpoles can be infected on their mouth parts (which is the only location of keratinized skin) and frogs post-metamorphosis can be infected almost anywhere (but primarily on the toes). The significance that salamanders (specifically tiger salamanders from the paper) can be infected is because they can perpetuate the presence of Bd in the environment which can then increase the odds that a frog will be infected by this disease. Salamanders can also overwinter in the water itself, while frogs live terrestrially during the winter. This is significant because without the living hosts keeping Bd alive in the water, it would have a high chance to die off over the winter in the water with no hosts.Hyman, Oliver (2012). Ecology of Chytridiomycosis in Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata). Diss. Arizona State University. Boreal chorus frogs in areas that contain salamanders capable of surviving with Bd cannot escape this disease, which could be why some populations are declining.

Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president of the United States by a major political party when she won the Democratic Party nomination in 2016. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to Donald Trump. Raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969, and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978, and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative—the Clinton health care plan—failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York. She was re-elected in 2006 and chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks. She supported the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002 but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. secretary of state in the first term of the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton established the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election. Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups. She is the current chancellor of Queen's University Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Early life and education =Early life= Mementos of Hillary Rodham's early life, shown at the William J. Clinton Presidential Center Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. She was raised in a United Methodist family who first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent, and managed a small but successful textile business, which he had founded. Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish, and Welsh descent. Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony. Rodham in sixth grade Rodham in Maine South High School's 1965 yearbook As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools she attended in Park Ridge. She participated in swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told the story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program.Clinton's story was thoroughly investigated by Fact Checker Michelle Ye Hee Lee in the Washington Post. Quote: \\"After receiving more information from the National Air and Space Museum, specifically a March 1962 letter with a similar tone and message as the Miss Kelly letter and Clinton's account, we decided the claim met the \\"reasonable person\\" standard. We award Clinton the rare Geppetto Checkmark [Statements and claims that contain \\"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth\\"].\\" Full report: Neither Clinton nor NASA has produced a copy of the actual response that she states she received. She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council and school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society. She was elected class vice president for her junior year but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \\"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\\". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then-new Maine South High School. There she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted \\"most likely to succeed.\\" She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class. Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career. Her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. She was raised in a politically conservative household,Brock 1996, p. 4\\\\. Her father was an outspoken Republican, while her mother kept quiet but was \\"basically a Democrat.\\" See also Bernstein 2007, p. 16. and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon, and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election. p. 266. Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.Troy 2006, p. 15; Gerth and Van Natta 2007, pp. 18–21; Bernstein 2007, pp. 34–36. The teacher, Paul Carlson, and the minister, Donald Jones, came into conflict in Park Ridge; Clinton would later see that as \\"an early indication of the cultural, political and religious fault lines that developed across America in the [next] forty years\\". (Clinton 2003, p. 23) Several dates have been published for the King speech she witnessed, but April 15, 1962, is the most likely, see =Wellesley College years= Rodham (center) campaigning for Wellesley College Government President in 1968, later winning the election In 1965, Rodham enrolled at Wellesley College, where she majored in political science. During her first year, she was president of the Wellesley Young Republicans.Clinton 2003, p. 31. Gives organization's prior name. As the leader of this \\"Rockefeller Republican\\"-oriented group, pp. 27–28. she supported the elections of moderate Republicans John Lindsay to mayor of New York City and Massachusetts attorney general Edward Brooke to the United States Senate.Brock 1996, pp. 12–13. She later stepped down from this position. In 2003 Clinton would write that her views concerning the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were changing in her early college years. In a letter to her youth minister at that time, she described herself as \\"a mind conservative and a heart liberal\\".Bernstein 2007, p. 50\\\\. Bernstein states she believed this combination was possible and that no equation better describes the adult Hillary Clinton. In contrast to the factions in the 1960s that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.Bernstein 2007, pp. 42–46; Troy 2006, pp. 18–19. By her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy. In early 1968 she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association, a position she held until early 1969. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges. A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female president of the United States. To help her better understand her changing political views, Professor Alan Schechter assigned Rodham to intern at the House Republican Conference, and she attended the \\"Wellesley in Washington\\" summer program. Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican representative Charles Goodell to help Governor Nelson Rockefeller's late- entry campaign for the Republican nomination. Rodham attended the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach. However, she was upset by the way Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's \\"veiled\\" racist messages, and she left the Republican Party for good. Rodham wrote her senior thesis, a critique of the tactics of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, under Professor Schechter. (Years later, while she was the first lady, access to her thesis was restricted at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation. The thesis was later released.) In 1969, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, she became the first student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of the commencement speaker, Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, The article features Rodham and two student commencement speakers from other schools, with photos and excerpts from their speeches. because of the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. She was asked to speak at the 50th anniversary convention of the League of Women Voters in Washington, D.C., the next year.Clinton, What Happened, p. 198. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).Morris 1996, p. 139; Bernstein 2007, p. 105\\\\. Clinton would later write, and repeat on the Late Show with David Letterman, that sliming fish was the best preparation she would ever have for living in Washington. Clinton 2003, pp. 42–43. =Yale Law School and postgraduate studies= Rodham then entered Yale Law School, where she was on the editorial board of the Yale Review of Law and Social Action. During her second year, she worked at the Yale Child Study Center, learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973).The authors of Beyond the Best Interests of the Child were Center director Al Solnit, Yale Law professor Joe Goldstein, and Anna Freud. She also took on cases of child abuse at Yale–New Haven Hospital, and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor. In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing.Morris 1996, pp. 142–43. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey. Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics. In the spring of 1971, she began dating fellow law student Bill Clinton. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of constitutional rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were current or former Communist Party members); Rodham worked on child custody and other cases. Clinton canceled his original summer plans and moved to live with her in California; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school. The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973, having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton. He first proposed marriage to her following graduation, but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his. Rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the Yale Child Study Center. In late 1973 her first scholarly article, \\"Children Under the Law\\", was published in the Harvard Educational Review. Discussing the new children's rights movement, the article stated that \\"child citizens\\" were \\"powerless individuals\\"Troy 2006, p. 21. and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age, but instead that courts should presume competence on a case-by-case basis, except when there is evidence otherwise. The article became frequently cited in the field. Marriage, family, law career and first ladyship of Arkansas =From the East Coast to Arkansas= During her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.Brock 1996, p. 42. In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the House Committee on the Judiciary during the Watergate scandal. Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum, Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for it. The committee's work culminated with the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974. By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant Betsey Wright moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career. Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president. Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur. After failing the District of Columbia bar examBernstein 2007, p. 92; Allen and Parnes 2014, p. 149\\\\. Taking an out-of-date bar study class may have been a factor. Two-thirds (551 of 817) of the candidates passed. Rodham did not tell even close friends of the failure until revealing it thirty years later in her autobiography. and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision. As she later wrote, \\"I chose to follow my heart instead of my head\\".Clinton 2003, p. 69. She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and became one of only two female faculty members in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.Clinton 2003, p. 70\\\\. Source for number of female faculty members. =Early Arkansas years= At the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades. Rodham became the first director of a new legal aid clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding. As a court- appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a \\"terrible case\\". During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center. Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else. In 1974, Bill Clinton lost an Arkansas congressional race, facing incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt. Rodham and Bill Clinton bought a house in Fayetteville in the summer of 1975 and she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room. A story about the marriage in the Arkansas Gazette indicated that she decided to retain the name Hillary Rodham. Her motivation was threefold. She wanted to keep the couple's professional lives separate, avoid apparent conflicts of interest, and as she told a friend at the time, \\"it showed that I was still me\\". The decision upset both mothers, who were more traditional.Clinton 2003, pp. 91–92. In 1976, Rodham temporarily relocated to Indianapolis to work as an Indiana state campaign organizer for the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter. In November 1976, Bill Clinton was elected Arkansas attorney general, and the couple moved to the state capital of Little Rock. In February 1977, Rodham joined the venerable Rose Law Firm, a bastion of Arkansan political and economic influence.Bernstein 2007, pp. 128, 103. The firm was called Rose, Nash, Williamson, Carroll, Clay & Giroir, but it simplified its name to Rose Law Firm in 1980. She specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while working pro bono in child advocacy; she rarely performed litigation work in court. Rodham maintained her interest in children's law and family policy, publishing the scholarly articles \\"Children's Policies: Abandonment and Neglect\\" in 1977 and \\"Children's Rights: A Legal Perspective\\" in 1979. The latter continued her argument that children's legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases, judicial intervention was sometimes warranted. An American Bar Association chair later said, \\"Her articles were important, not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate.\\" Historian Garry Wills would later describe her as \\"one of the more important scholar-activists of the last two decades\\". Conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority, would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents, and exemplified critical legal studies run amok.Olson 1999, p. 57. Hillary and Bill lived in this house in Little Rock's Hillcrest neighborhood while he was Arkansas Attorney General (1977–1979). p. 244. In 1977, Rodham cofounded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a state-level alliance with the Children's Defense Fund. Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corporation. She held that position from 1978 until the end of 1981. From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to hold the job.Morris 1996, p. 225. During her time as chair, funding for the corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization. Following her husband's November 1978 election as governor of Arkansas, Rodham became that state's first lady in January 1979. She would hold that title for twelve nonconsecutive years (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be the chair of the Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year, where she secured federal funds to expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees. In 1979, Rodham became the first woman to be made a full partner in Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to supplement their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple began their ill-fated investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s. On February 27, 1980, Rodham gave birth to the couple's only child, a daughter whom they named Chelsea. In November 1980, Bill Clinton was defeated in his bid for re-election. =Later Arkansas years= Ronald and First Lady Nancy Reagan Two years after leaving office, Bill Clinton returned to his job as governor of Arkansas after he won the election of 1982. During her husband's campaign, Hillary began to use the name \\"Hillary Clinton\\", or sometimes \\"Mrs. Bill Clinton\\", to assuage the concerns of Arkansas voters; she also took a leave of absence from Rose Law to campaign for him full-time. During her second stint as the first lady of Arkansas, she made a point of using Hillary Rodham Clinton as her name. She was named chair of the Arkansas Education Standards Committee in 1983, where she sought to reform the state's court-sanctioned public education system.Bernstein 2007, pp. 170–75. Bernstein states that \\"the political battle for education reform ... would be her greatest accomplishment in public life until she was elected to the U.S. Senate.\\" In one of the Clinton governorship's most important initiatives, she fought a prolonged but ultimately successful battle against the Arkansas Education Association to establish mandatory teacher testing and state standards for curriculum and classroom size. It became her introduction into the politics of a highly visible public policy effort. In 1985, she introduced Arkansas's Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youth, a program that helps parents work with their children in preschool preparedness and literacy. p. 295. She was named Arkansas Woman of the Year in 1983 and Arkansas Mother of the Year in 1984.Morris 1996, p. 330.Brock 1996, pp. 176–77. Clinton continued to practice law with the Rose Law Firm while she was the first lady of Arkansas. She earned less than the other partners, as she billed fewer hours but still made more than $200,000 in her final year there. The firm considered her a \\"rainmaker\\" because she brought in clients, partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections. She was also very influential in the appointment of state judges. Bill Clinton's Republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial re-election campaign accused the Clintons of conflict of interest because Rose Law did state business; the Clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated. From 1982 to 1988, Clinton was on the board of directors, sometimes as chair, of the New World Foundation, which funded a variety of New Left interest groups.Troy 2006, p. 29. From 1987 to 1991, she was the first chair of the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession, created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it. She was twice named by The National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America—in 1988 and in 1991. When Bill Clinton thought about not running again for governor in 1990, Hillary Clinton considered running. Private polls were unfavorable, however, and in the end he ran and was re- elected for the final time. Clinton in 1992 Clinton was chairman of the board of the Children's Defense Fund and on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Legal Services (1988–92) In addition to her positions with nonprofit organizations, she also held positions on the corporate board of directors of TCBY (1985–92), Bio entry. Wal-Mart Stores (1986–92) and Lafarge (1990–92). TCBY and Wal-Mart were Arkansas-based companies that were also clients of Rose Law. Clinton was the first female member on Wal-Mart's board, added following pressure on chairman Sam Walton to name a woman to it. Once there, she pushed successfully for Wal-Mart to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. She was largely unsuccessful in her campaign for more women to be added to the company's management and was silent about the company's famously anti-labor union practices. According to Dan Kaufman, awareness of this later became a factor in her loss of credibility with organized labor, helping contribute to her loss in the 2016 election, where slightly less than half of union members voted for Donald Trump. =Bill Clinton presidential campaign of 1992= Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed allegations that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged \\"causing pain in my marriage\\". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.Troy 2006, pp. 39–42; Gerth and Van Natta 2007, pp. 94–96. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song \\"Stand by Your Man\\". Later in the campaign, she commented she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers. In retrospect, she admitted they were ill-considered. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would \\"get two for the price of one\\", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.Burns 2008, p. 140. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article \\"The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock\\", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth. First Lady of the United States (1993–2001) When Bill Clinton took office as president in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the first lady. Her press secretary reiterated she would be using that form of her name. She was the first in this role to have a postgraduate degree and her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. Clinton had the first postgraduate degree through regular study and scholarly work. Eleanor Roosevelt had previously been awarded a postgraduate honorary degree. Clinton's successor Laura Bush became the second first lady with a postgraduate degree. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing.Troy 2006, p. 71. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration. Her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones.Troy 2006, p. 68. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.Troy 2006, p. xii. Some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy. Supporters pointed out that Clinton's role in policy was no different from that of other White House advisors, and that voters had been well aware she would play an active role in her husband's presidency. Bill Clinton's campaign promise of \\"two for the price of one\\" led opponents to refer derisively to the Clintons as \\"co-presidents\\" or sometimes use the Arkansas label \\"Billary\\". The pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send Hillary Clinton into \\"imaginary discussions\\" with the also-politically active Eleanor Roosevelt. From the time she came to Washington, Hillary also found refuge in a prayer group of the Fellowship that featured many wives of conservative Washington figures. Triggered in part by the death of her father in April 1993, she publicly sought to find a synthesis of Methodist teachings, liberal religious political philosophy and Tikkun editor Michael Lerner's \\"politics of meaning\\" to overcome what she saw as America's \\"sleeping sickness of the soul\\"; that would lead to a willingness \\"to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century, moving into a new millennium\\". =Health care and other policy initiatives= Clinton presenting her health care plan, September 1993 In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as \\"Hillarycare\\" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times. Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994. Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors. The first lady's approval ratings, which had generally been in the high-50 percent range during her first year, fell to 44 percent in April 1994 and 35 percent by September 1994.Bernstein 2007, pp. 240, 380, 530. The Whitewater investigations were also a factor in her declining rating. Republicans made the Clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections. They saw a net gain of 54 seats in the House election and eight in the Senate election, winning control of both; many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the Democrats' defeat, especially among independent voters. The White House subsequently sought to downplay Clinton's role in shaping policy.Burns 2008, p. 141. Opponents of universal health care would continue to use \\"Hillarycare\\" as a pejorative label for similar plans by others. Read Across America Day in Maryland, 1998 Along with senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a force behind the passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. This federal bill gave state support to children whose parents could not provide them health coverage. She conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome. Enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency. When the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican- controlled Congress lacking protections for people coming off welfare, however, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did. A third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available. This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called \\"sad and painful\\". Together with Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton helped create the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice. In 1997, she initiated and shepherded the Adoption and Safe Families Act, which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as the first lady. In 1999, she was instrumental in the passage of the Foster Care Independence Act, which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was the host for various White House conferences. These included one on Child Care (1997), on Early Childhood Development and Learning (1997), and on Children and Adolescents (2000). She also hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Teenagers (2000), and the first-ever White House Conference on Philanthropy (1999). Clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time, breaking the record for most-traveled first lady previously held by Pat Nixon. She did not hold a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but played a role in U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department, without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited, and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy. Clinton delivering her \\"human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights\\" speech in Beijing in September 1995 (20:19) In a September 1995 speech before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Clinton argued forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the People's Republic of China itself. She declared, \\"it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights\\". Delegates from over 180 countries heard her say: \\"If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.\\" In doing so, she resisted both internal administration and Chinese pressure to soften her remarks. The speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later women around the world would recite Clinton's key phrases.Hudson and Leidl 2015, pp. 7–8. During the late 1990s, she was one of the most prominent international figures to speak out against the treatment of Afghan women by the Taliban. pp. 70, 182. She helped create Vital Voices, an international initiative sponsored by the U.S. to encourage the participation of women in the political processes of their countries.Hudson and Leidl 2015, pp. 25–26. It and Clinton's own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the Northern Ireland peace process. In 1997, Clinton returned to Northern Ireland to deliver the inaugural Joyce McCartan lecture at the University of Ulster in honour of the community campaigner she had meet during her visit in Belfast in 1995. =Whitewater and other investigations= Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel, committees of the U.S. Congress and the press. The Whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from its publication in a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as the first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed, and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. After a two-year search, the records were found in the first lady's White House book room and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first spouse of a U.S. president to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing. Inauguration Day walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to start Bill's second term as president, January 20, 1997 Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as \\"Travelgate\\", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas. The 1996 discovery of a two- year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made \\"factually false\\" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her. In March 1994, newspaper reports revealed that Clinton had earned spectacular profits from cattle futures trading in 1978–79. The press made allegations that Clinton had engaged in a conflict of interest and disguised a bribery. Several individuals analyzed her trading records, but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing. An outgrowth of the \\"Travelgate\\" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called \\"Filegate\\". Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter. In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property. During the last year of Bill Clinton's time in office, those gifts were shipped to the Clintons' private residence. =It Takes a Village release and tour= In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for American children in the book It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us. In January 1996, she went on a ten-city book tour and made numerous television appearances to promote the book, although she was frequently hit with questions about her involvement in the Whitewater and Travelgate controversies. The book spent 18 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List that year, including three weeks at number one.See results of this New York Times archive search. On list January 28 through May 26, 1996. At number one February 4, 11 and 18. By 2000, it had sold 450,000 copies in hardcover and another 200,000 in paperback. Clinton received the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 1997 for the book's audio recording. She was the first president's wife to win a Grammy Award. =Response to Lewinsky scandal= In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.Troy 2006, pp. 176–77. Events surrounding the Lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\".Troy 2006, p. 183. She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.Troy 2006, p. 187. After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage. The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.Brower 2015, pp. 141–49. Public reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70 percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to \\"a love that has persisted for decades\\" and add: \\"No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.\\"Clinton 2003, p. 75. Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House \\"not only dead broke, but in debt\\". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks. =Other books and initiatives= Other books published by Clinton when she was the first lady include Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to the First Pets (1998) and An Invitation to the White House: At Home with History (2000). In 2001, she wrote an afterword to the children's book Beatrice's Goat. She was the founding chair of Save America's Treasures, a nationwide effort matching federal funds with private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites. This included the flag that inspired \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and the First Ladies National Historic Site in Canton, Ohio. She also published a weekly syndicated newspaper column titled \\"Talking It Over\\" from 1995 to 2000. It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world. =Traditional duties= She was head of the White House Millennium Council and hosted Millennium Evenings, a series of lectures that discussed futures studies, one of which became the first live simultaneous webcast from the White House. Clinton also created the first White House Sculpture Garden, located in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which displayed large contemporary American works of art loaned by museums. In the White House, Clinton placed donated handicrafts of contemporary American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating display in the state rooms. She oversaw the restoration of the Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe, p. liii. and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing of the Treaty Room and a presidential study to have a 19th-century look. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most.Brower 2015, pp. 50–55. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000. United States Senate (2001–2009) =2000 U.S. Senate election= When New York's long-serving U.S. senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race. Bill de Blasio was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a \\"listening tour\\" of small-group settings. She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican Upstate New York regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000 jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care. The contest drew national attention. During a September debate, Lazio blundered when he seemed to invade Clinton's personal space by trying to get her to sign a fundraising agreement. Their campaigns, along with Giuliani's initial effort, spent a record combined $90 million. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2000, with 55 percent of the vote to Lazio's 43 percent. She was sworn in as U.S. senator on January 3, 2001, and as George W. Bush was still 17 days away from being inaugurated as president after winning the 2000 presidential election, that meant from January 3–20, she simultaneously held the titles of First Lady and Senator - a first in U.S. history. Publisher Simon & Schuster paid Clinton a near-record advance of $8 million in December 2000 for her autobiography, released in 2003, as Living History. =First term= U.S. senator by Vice President Al Gore in the Old Senate Chamber, as Bill and Chelsea look on Official photo as U.S. senator Upon entering the Senate, Clinton maintained a low public profile and built relationships with senators from both parties. She forged alliances with religiously inclined senators by becoming a regular participant in the Senate Prayer Breakfast. She sat on five Senate committees: Committee on Budget (2001–02), Committee on Armed Services (2003–09), Committee on Environment and Public Works (2001–09), Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2001–09) and Special Committee on Aging. She was also a member of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (2001–09). Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Clinton sought to obtain funding for the recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21 billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment. She subsequently took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties. In March 2006 she voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 that had gained large majority support. Clinton strongly supported the 2001 U.S. military action in Afghanistan, saying it was a chance to combat terrorism while improving the lives of Afghan women who suffered under the Taliban government. Clinton voted in favor of the October 2002 Iraq War Resolution, which authorized President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 74, 76–77. After the Iraq War began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there. On a visit to Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that parts of the country were functioning well. Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000 soldiers to ease the strain. In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from Iraq would be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay \\"until the job is done\\" was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis \\"an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves\\". Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal.Heilemann and Halperin 2010, pp. 34, 39. Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York. She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers. By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying she \\"got it wrong\\" and the vote in support had been a \\"mistake\\". Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Simon & Schuster released Living History: The book set a first-week sales record for a nonfiction work, went on to sell more than one million copies in the first month following publication, and was translated into twelve foreign languages. Clinton's audio recording of the book earned her a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of John Roberts as chief justice of the United States and the 2006 confirmation of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, filibustering the latter. In 2005, Clinton called for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how hidden sex scenes showed up in the controversial video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Along with senators Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh, she introduced the Family Entertainment Protection Act, intended to protect children from inappropriate content found in video games. In 2004 and 2006, Clinton voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment that sought to prohibit same-sex marriage. Looking to establish a \\"progressive infrastructure\\" to rival that of American conservatism, Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff John Podesta's Center for American Progress, shared aides with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, founded in 2003 and advised the Clintons' former antagonist David Brock's Media Matters for America, created in 2004. Following the 2004 Senate elections, she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid to create a Senate war room to handle daily political messaging. =2006 reelection campaign= In November 2004, Clinton announced she would seek a second Senate term. She easily won the Democratic nomination over opposition from antiwar activist Jonathan Tasini. The early frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, withdrew from the contest after several months of poor campaign performance. Clinton's eventual opponent in the general election was Republican candidate John Spencer, a former Mayor of Yonkers. Clinton won the election on November 7, 2006, with 67 percent of the vote to Spencer's 31 percent, carrying all but four of New York's sixty-two counties. Her campaign spent $36 million for her reelection, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Some Democrats criticized her for spending too much in a one-sided contest, while some supporters were concerned she did not leave more funds for a potential presidential bid in 2008. In the following months, she transferred $10 million of her Senate funds toward her presidential campaign.Balz and Johnson 2009, p. 91. =Second term= Clinton listens as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Mullen, responds to a question during his 2007 confirmation hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee Clinton opposed the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, for both military and domestic political reasons (by the following year, she was privately acknowledging the surge had been successful). In March of that year, she voted in favor of a war-spending bill that required President Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq by a deadline; it passed almost completely along party lines but was subsequently vetoed by Bush. In May, a compromise war funding bill that removed withdrawal deadlines but tied funding to progress benchmarks for the Iraqi government passed the Senate by a vote of 80–14 and would be signed by Bush; Clinton was one of those who voted against it. She responded to General David Petraeus's September 2007 Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq by saying, \\"I think that the reports that you provide to us really require a willing suspension of disbelief.\\" In March 2007, in response to the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy, Clinton called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. Regarding the high-profile, hotly debated immigration reform bill known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, Clinton cast several votes in support of the bill, which eventually failed to gain cloture. As the financial crisis of 2007–08 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008, Clinton supported the proposed bailout of the U.S. financial system, voting in favor of the $700 billion law that created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, saying it represented the interests of the American people. It passed the Senate 74–25. In 2007, Clinton and Virginia senator Jim Webb called for an investigation into whether the body armor issued to soldiers in Iraq was adequate. 2008 presidential campaign Clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for U.S. president since at least early 2003. On January 20, 2007, she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the United States presidential election of 2008, stating: \\"I'm in and I'm in to win.\\" No woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency, and no first lady had ever run for president. When Bill Clinton became president in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her presidential race. Later disclosure statements revealed the couple's worth was now upwards of $50 million. They had earned over $100 million since 2000—most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities. Clinton at the 2007 CDA National Convention Throughout the first half of 2007, Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were her strongest competitors. The biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the Iraq War, which Obama had opposed from the beginning. Clinton and Obama both set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter. At the end of October, Clinton fared poorly in her debate performance against Obama, Edwards, and her other opponents.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 95–99.Heilemann and Halperin 2010, pp. 145–49. Obama's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than Clinton's message of experience. Clinton campaigning at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, Minnesota, two days before Super Tuesday, 2008 In the first vote of 2008, she placed third in the January3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards.Kornblut 2009, p. 57. Obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Obama.Heilemann and Halperin 2010, pp. 186–90. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Also \\"The 2008 Presidential Campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton\\" from them. See Shirley Chisholm#1972 presidential campaign for the previous marks for best performance by a major-party woman presidential candidate. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voter's question the day before the election. The nature of the contest fractured in the next few days. Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by Hillary Clinton concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of his campaign. Despite attempts by both Hillary and Obama to downplay the issue, Democratic voting became more polarized as a result, with Clinton losing much of her support among African Americans.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 163–66. She lost by a two-to-one margin to Obama in the January 26, South Carolina primary, setting up, with Edwards soon dropping out, an intense two-person contest for the twenty-two February5 Super Tuesday states. Bill Clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the South Carolina campaign, and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president \\"needs to stop\\". The South Carolina campaign had done lasting damage to Clinton, eroding her support among the Democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of Obama by Ted Kennedy.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 156, 173–78. State-by-state popular votes in the Democratic primaries and caucuses, shaded by percentage won: Obama in purple, Clinton in green. (Popular vote winners and delegate winners differed in New Hampshire, Nevada, Missouri, Texas and Guam.) On Super Tuesday, Clinton won the largest states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states;Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 188–89. they almost evenly split the total popular vote.Heilemann and Halperin 2010, p. 223. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the Democratic proportional allocation rules. The Clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and she made several top-level personnel changes.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 148–54, 190–92. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular.Balz and Johnson 2009, p. 196. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non- college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.Balz and Johnson 2009, pp. 216–17. Clinton speaks on behalf of her former rival, Barack Obama, during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.Heilemann and Halperin 2010, p. 258. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 25, 30. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640 pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; at the time of the clinching, Clinton had 286 superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13 million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013. Official secretary of state portrait, 2009 Secretary of State (2009–2013) =Nomination and confirmation= Associate Judge Kathryn Oberly of the D.C. Court of Appeals administers the oath of office of secretary of state to Hillary Rodham Clinton as her husband Bill Clinton holds the Bible In mid-November 2008, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as secretary of state in his administration.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 48–52. She was initially quite reluctant, but on November 20 she told Obama she would accept the position.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 58–60. On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state. Clinton said she did not want to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \\"difficult and exciting adventure\\". As part of the nomination and to relieve concerns of conflict of interest, Bill Clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.Allen and Parnes 2014, p. 81. The appointment required a Saxbe fix, passed and signed into law in December 2008. Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration; two days later, the committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal. On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2. Clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first lady to be a member of the United States Cabinet. =First half of tenure= 21st NATO summit, April 2009 Clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: \\"We have a lot of damage to repair.\\" She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions. Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 150–51. The first such review was issued in late 2010. It called for the U.S. leading through \\"civilian power\\" as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises. It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world. A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Clinton hold a \\"reset button\\", March 2009 In a 2009 internal debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, Clinton sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \\"Afghanistan surge\\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. She prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 122–24. In March 2009, Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \\"reset button\\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 136–38. The photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into Russian. The policy, which became known as the Russian reset, led to improved cooperation in several areas during Medvedev's time in office. Relations would worsen considerably, however, following Vladimir Putin's return to the position in 2012. In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, Clinton's intervention overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish–Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations. In Pakistan, she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students, talk show hosts and tribal elders, in an attempt to repair the Pakistani image of the U.S. Beginning in 2010, she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015. Clinton and Obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 117–21. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions. Greeting service members at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, October 2010 In a prepared speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet. Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it. The speech garnered attention as the first time a senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element of American foreign policy. In July 2010, she visited South Korea, where she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the US State Department, ensuring that the Caracol Industrial Park would have a key tenant. This was part of the \\"build back better\\" program initiated by her husband, named UN Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 after a tropical storm season caused $1 billion in damages to the island. In January 2011, Clinton traveled to Haiti in order to help pave the way for the election of Michel Martelly. =Second half of tenure= The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration. Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \\"stable\\", to a stance that there needed to be an \\"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\\", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters. Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments. As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others. London meeting to discuss NATO military intervention in Libya, March 29, 2011 As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power. This was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. The State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called \\"convening power\\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. See also The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state. The wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate. During April 2011, internal deliberations of the president's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 233–37. Following the completion of the mission on May2 resulting in bin Laden's death, Clinton played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.) Clinton with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi during her December 2011 visit to Myanmar In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, Clinton said that, \\"Gay rights are human rights\\", and that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gay people abroad.Allen and Parnes 2014, p. 372. The same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. She met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms.Ghattas 2013, pp. 294–304. She also said the 21st century would be \\"America's Pacific century\\", a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \\"pivot to Asia\\".Ghattas 2013, p. 187. During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama administration initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, they called for him to resign from the presidency.Ghattas 2013, pp. 282–85. The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. The proposal was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict, fearing that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.Allen and Parnes 2014, p. 340. In December 2012, Clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 339–42, 360–62. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, was treated with anticoagulant medication, and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery. =Overall themes= alt=President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune's Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011. They are watching live feed from drones operating over the bin Laden complex. Throughout her time in office (and mentioned in her final speech concluding it), Clinton viewed \\"smart power\\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy. As such, she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.Ghattas 2013, pp. 11, 334. In debates over use of military force, she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration. In August 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in Libya and the initial U.S. response towards the Syrian Civil War as examples of smart power in action. Clinton greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries vis-à-vis their governments. And in the Mideast turmoil, Clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide. Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \\"Hillary Doctrine\\", she viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of that state.Hudson and Leidl 2015, pp. 3–4. In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.Hudson and Leidl 2015, pp. 57–60. Clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state (Time magazine wrote that \\"Clinton's endurance is legendary\\".) The first secretary of state to visit countries like Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age. As early as March 2011, she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should Obama be re-elected in 2012; in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor. Her last day as secretary of state was February 1, 2013. Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had accomplished, and highlighted her focus on goals she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.Ghattas 2013, pp. 216, 225. She has also been criticized for accepting millions in dollars in donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State. =Benghazi attack and subsequent hearings= Obama and Clinton honor the Benghazi attack victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony, held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012 On September 11, 2012, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate, and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses saying the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events. On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations. Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate \\"talking points\\" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, \\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator.\\" In November 2014, the House Intelligence Committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administration's response to the attack. The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May 2014 and conducted a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen through the prism of domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House majority leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee.For accounts of Clinton's appearance before the select committee, see ; ; ; ; ; and The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines. The Republican report offered some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton. Email controversy A controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's inspector general revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \\"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\\". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called \\"born classified\\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails \\"contained classified State Department information when originated\\". In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked. Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \\"I never sent or received any classified material—they are retroactively classifying it.\\" On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \\"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\\" On July 5, 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director James Comey said: > 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to > contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight > of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they > were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight > contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of > classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were > \\"up-classified\\" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not > been classified at the time the e-mails were sent. Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \\"c\\" in parentheses, described as \\"portion markings\\" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not \\"technically sophisticated\\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was \\"possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account\\". He added that \\"[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\\". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that \\"no reasonable prosecutor\\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \\"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\\". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute. On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch—who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27—confirmed that the probe into Clinton's use of private email servers would be closed without criminal charges. On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner, husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed the conclusion it had reached in July. The notification was later cited by Clinton as a factor in her loss in the 2016 presidential election. The emails controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election. In September 2019, the State Department finished its internal review into 33,000 emails that Clinton had turned over. The investigation that began in 2016 found 588 violations of security procedures and found that Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information. In 91 cases, the culpability of sending classified information could be attributed to 38 people, but the review concluded there was \\"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\\". Clinton Foundation, Hard Choices, and speeches Clinton in September 2014 When Clinton left the State Department, she returned to private life for the first time in thirty years. She and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013.Allen and Parnes 2014, pp. 374–75, 382–85. There she focused on early childhood development efforts, including an initiative called Too Small to Fail and a $600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide, led by former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In 2014, Clinton published a second memoir, Hard Choices, which focused on her time as secretary of state. , the book has sold about 280,000 copies. Clinton also led the No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, a partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the Beijing conference in 1995; its March 2015 report said that while \\"There has never been a better time in history to be born a woman ... this data shows just how far we still have to go.\\" The foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments, which it had stopped doing while she was secretary of state. However, even though the Clinton Foundation had stopped taking donations from foreign governments, they continued to take large donations from foreign citizens who were sometimes linked to their governments. She began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit. There she received $200,000–225,000 per engagement, often appearing before Wall Street firms or at business conventions. She also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation. For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11 million from her speeches. For the overall period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141 million, paid some $56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15 million to charity. , she was estimated to be worth over $30 million on her own, or $45–53 million with her husband. Clinton resigned from the board of the foundation in April 2015, when she began her presidential campaign. The foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six Western nations only. 2016 presidential campaign Clinton campaigning for president in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016, with Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren (seated) On April 12, 2015, Clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. Prior to her campaign, Clinton had claimed in an interview on NDTV in May 2012 that she would not seek the presidency again, but later wrote in her 2014 autobiography Hard Choices that she had not decided. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Her campaign focused on: raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool, making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. His longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties. In the initial contest of the primaries season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders— the first woman to win them. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five- percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort. On March 1 Super Tuesday, Clinton won seven of eleven contests, including a string of dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American voters. She opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout. Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents. Clinton did better among older, black and Hispanic voter populations, and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats. By June 5, 2016, she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee. On June 7, after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn becoming the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million. Clinton, accepting Senator Bernie Sanders' endorsement in New Hampshire, July 2016 Clinton was formally nominated at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 26, 2016, becoming the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. Her choice of vice presidential running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, was nominated by the convention the following day. Her opponents in the general election included Republican Donald Trump, Libertarian Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Around the time of the convention, WikiLeaks released emails that suggested the DNC and the Clinton campaign tilted the primary in Clinton's favor. Clinton held a significant lead in national polls over Trump throughout most of 2016. In early July, Trump and Clinton were tied in major polls following the FBI's conclusion of its investigation into her emails. FBI Director James Comey concluded Clinton had been \\"extremely careless\\" in her handling of classified government material. In late July, Trump gained his first lead over Clinton in major polls following a three to four percentage point convention bounce at the Republican National Convention. This was in line with the average bounce in conventions since 2004, although it was toward the low side by historical standards. Following Clinton's seven percentage point convention bounce at the Democratic National Convention, she regained a significant lead in national polls at the start of August. In fall 2016, Clinton and Tim Kaine published Stronger Together, which outlined their vision for the United States. Clinton delivering her concession speech Clinton was defeated by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016, presidential election. By the early morning hours of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win; media sources proclaimed him the winner. Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave his victory speech. The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as their next president, saying: \\"We owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.\\" Though Clinton lost the election by capturing only 232 electoral votes to Trump's 306, she won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, or 2.1% of the voter base. She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election. She won the most votes of any candidate who did not take office and the third-most votes of any candidate in history, though she did not have the greatest percentage win of a losing candidate. (Andrew Jackson won the popular vote by 10.4% but lost to John Quincy Adams). On December 19, 2016, when electors formally voted, Clinton lost five of her initial 232 votes due to faithless electors, with three of her Washington votes being cast instead for Colin Powell, one being cast for Faith Spotted Eagle, and one in Hawaii being cast for Bernie Sanders. Post-2016 election activities Bill and Hillary Clinton at Donald Trump's inauguration In their respective capacities as a former president and a former first lady, Bill and Hillary Clinton attended the inauguration of Donald Trump with their daughter, Chelsea. The morning of the inauguration Clinton wrote on her Twitter account, \\"I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values, I will never stop believing in our country & its future.\\" Clinton delivered a St. Patrick's Day speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 2017, referring to reports of her being seen taking walks in the woods around Chappaqua following her loss in the presidential election. Clinton indicated her readiness to emerge from \\"the woods\\" and become politically active again. On March 24, 2017, after the postponement of a Congressional vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Clinton labeled the day \\"a victory for the 24,000,000 people at risk of losing their health insurance\\" and warned of an ongoing battle to maintain coverage. She went on to call the American Health Care Act \\"a disastrous bill\\" during a San Francisco speech four days later. After the House narrowly passed the American Health Care Act on May 4, Clinton dubbed it a \\"shameful failure of policy & morality by GOP\\". On June 23, the day after Senate Republicans revealed a draft of their healthcare reform legislation, Clinton tweeted, \\"This is a critical moment about choosing people over politics. Speak out against this bill.\\" Clinton commented that she would not seek public office again in April. On April 6, in response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, Clinton said the U.S. should take out Bashar al-Assad's airfields and thereby \\"prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them\\". In May 2017 Clinton announced the formation of Onward Together, a new political action committee that she wrote is \\"dedicated to advancing the progressive vision that earned nearly 66 million votes in the last election\\". In a June 2017 appearance at a Baltimore fundraiser for the Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel (ECYP), Clinton condemned the 2017 Portland train attack: \\"When violence motivated by hatred from, Portland, Oregon, to College Park, ends the lives of young Americans, this program's mission of spreading tolerance is more urgent than ever.\\" On June 14, after the Congressional baseball shooting, Clinton tweeted, \\"2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we're all ultimately on one team. My thoughts are with the members of Congress, staff & heroic police.\\" Clinton's third memoir, What Happened, an account of her loss in the 2016 election, was released on September 12, 2017, by Simon & Schuster, in print, e-book, and as an audiobook read by the author. A book tour and a series of interviews and personal appearances were arranged for the launch. What Happened sold 300,000 copies in its first week, less than her 2003 memoir, Living History, but triple the first-week sales of her previous memoir, 2014's Hard Choices. Simon & Schuster announced that What Happened had sold more e-books in its first-week than any nonfiction e-book since 2010. As of December 10, 2017, the book had sold 448,947 hardcover copies. An announcement was made in February 2017 that efforts were under way to render her 1996 book It Takes a Village as a picture book. Marla Frazee, a two-time winner of the Caldecott Medal, was announced as the illustrator. Clinton had worked on it with Frazee during her 2016 presidential election campaign. The result was published on the same day of publication as What Happened. The book is aimed at preschool-aged children, although a few messages are more likely better understood by adults. In October 2017, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Swansea University, whose College of Law was renamed the Hillary Rodham Clinton School of Law in her honor. In October 2018, Hillary and Bill Clinton announced plans for a 13-city speaking tour in various cities in the United States and Canada between November 2018 and May 2019. Hillary was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in law (LLD) at Queen's University Belfast on October 10, 2018, after giving a speech on Northern Ireland and the impacts of Brexit at Whitla Hall, Belfast. In June 2018, Trinity College Dublin awarded her with an honorary doctorate (LLD). A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to Clinton's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. It was intercepted by the Secret Service. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders and to CNN. On March 4, 2019, Clinton announced that she would not run for president in 2020. In October 2019, Trump tweeted that Clinton should run for a third time, prompting her response of \\"don't tempt me\\". On April 28, 2020, Clinton endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president in the 2020 election. Clinton delivered a speech in the 2020 Democratic National Convention. =Comments on President Trump= On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton. On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter \\"doesn't work\\" when pursuing important negotiations. \\"Kim Jong Un ... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position\\". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without \\"a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change.\\" While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was \\"a con\\" for underfunding domestic programs. On June 1, when President Trump announced withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a \\"historic mistake\\". On September 29, 2019, in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Clinton described Trump as a \\"threat\\" to the country's standing in the world; an \\"illegitimate president\\", despite having won the election; and a \\"corrupt human tornado\\". =Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast= On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at Queen's University Belfast after her husband had previously played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process and the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, Thomas J. Moran. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that \\"the university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence\\". Queen's Pro- Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment \\"will be an incredible advocate for Queen's\\" who can act as an \\"inspirational role model\\". Political positions Clinton with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Clinton supports maintaining U.S. influence in the Middle East. Using her Senate votes, several organizations have attempted to measure Clinton's place on the political spectrum scientifically. National Journals 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 on the political spectrum, relative to the Senate at the time, with a rating of1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative. National Journals subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007. A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of Princeton University and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of Stanford University found her likely to be the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal senator. The Almanac of American Politics, edited by Michael Barone and Richard E. Cohen, rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative, with 100 as the highest rating, in three areas: Economic, Social and Foreign. Averaged for the four years, the ratings are: Economic = 75 liberal, 23 conservative; Social = 83 liberal, 6 conservative; Foreign = 66 liberal, 30 conservative. Total average = 75 liberal, 20 conservative. According to FiveThirtyEight's measure of political ideology, \\"Clinton was one of the most liberal members during her time in the Senate.\\" Organizations have also attempted to provide more recent assessments of Clinton after she reentered elective politics in 2015. Based on her stated positions from the 1990s to the present, On the Issues places her in the \\"Left Liberal\\" region on their two-dimensional grid of social and economic ideologies, with a social score of 80 on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances, with an economic score of ten on a scale of zero more-restrictive to 100 less-government stances. Crowdpac, which does a data aggregation of campaign contributions, votes and speeches, gives her a 6.5L rating on a one-dimensional left-right scale from 10L (most liberal) to 10C (most conservative). Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90 percent \\"Liberal Quotient\\" from Americans for Democratic Action, Average consists of a 95 in 2001 through 2004 and 2006, a 100 in 2005, a 75 in 2007, and a 70 in 2008 (the decline in the final two years was due to missed votes while campaigning for president) and a lifetime eight percent rating from the American Conservative Union. Lifetime rating is given. In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which The New York Times called \\"optimistic\\" and \\"wide-ranging\\". Basing her economic philosophy on inclusive capitalism, Clinton proposed a \\"clawback\\" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an \\"exit tax\\" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas. Clinton currently opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (though she previously described it as \\"the gold standard\\" of trade deals). She supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank and holds that \\"any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security\\". As senator (2001–2009), her record on trade was mixed; she voted in favor of some trade agreements but not others. Given the climate of unlimited campaign contributions following the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, Clinton called for a constitutional amendment to limit \\"unaccountable money\\" in politics. In July 2016, she \\"committed\\" to introducing a U.S. constitutional amendment that would result in overturning the 2010 Citizens United decision. On December 7, 2015, Clinton presented her detailed plans for regulating Wall Street financial activities in the New York Times. 2016 presidential campaign logo Accepting the scientific consensus on climate change, Clinton supports cap-and-trade, and opposed the Keystone XL pipeline. She supported \\"equal pay for equal work\\", to address current shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do. Clinton has explicitly focused on family issues and supports universal preschool. These programs would be funded by proposing tax increases on the wealthy, including a \\"fair share surcharge\\". Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act and would have added a \\"public option\\" that competed with private insurers and enabled people \\"50 or 55 and up\\" to buy into Medicare. On LGBT rights, she supports the right to same-sex marriage, a position that has changed throughout her political career. In 2000, she was against such marriages altogether. In 2006, she said only that she would support a state's decision to permit same-sex marriages, but opposed federally amending the Constitution to permit same-sex marriage. While running for president in 2007, she again reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, although expressed her support of civil unions. 2013 marked the first time that Clinton expressed support for a national right to same-sex marriage. In 2000, she was the first spouse of a US president to march in an LGBT pride parade. In 2016, she was the first major- party presidential candidate ever to write an op-ed for an LGBT newspaper (Philadelphia Gay News). Clinton held that allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship \\"s at its heart a family issue\\", and expressed support for Obama's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which would allow up to five million undocumented immigrants to gain deferral of deportation and authorization to legally work in the United States. However, in 2014, Clinton stated that unaccompanied children crossing the border \\"should be sent back.\\" She opposed and criticized Trump's call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Expressing support for Common Core she said, \\"The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized ... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And you see the value of it, you understand why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't understand the value of a core, in this sense a Common Core.\\" On foreign affairs, Clinton voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq in October 2002, a vote she later \\"regretted\\". She favored arming Syria's rebel fighters in 2012 and has called for the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. She supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the NATO-led military intervention in Libya to oust former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Clinton is in favor of maintaining American influence in the Middle East. She has told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, \\"America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security and survival.\\" Clinton expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2006 Lebanon War and 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In April 2017, Clinton called for strikes against Syrian airfields. In 2000, Clinton advocated for the elimination of the electoral college. She promised to co-sponsor legislation that would abolish it, resulting in the direct election of the president. Religious views Clinton in 2011 Clinton has been a lifelong Methodist, attending various churches throughout her lifetime; all belonging to the United Methodist Church: Clinton discussed her faith at 2014 United Methodist Women church rally at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville, Kentucky. However, she has seldom discussed her faith while campaigning. She has openly discussed her Christianity on several occasions, discussing for example the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself, of helping the poor and \\"creating opportunities for others to be lifted up\\". Clinton has also expressed disappointment that \\"Christianity, which has such great love at its core, is sometimes used to condemn so quickly and judge so harshly.\\" Professor Paul Kengor, author of God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life has suggested that Clinton's political positions are rooted in her faith. She often expresses a maxim often attributed to John Wesley: \\"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can.\\" In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy \\"made sure I learned [these] words from our Methodist faith\\". Cultural and political image Clinton worked at Rose Law Firm for fifteen years. Her professional career and political involvement set the stage for public reaction to her as the first lady. Over a hundred books and scholarly works have been written about Clinton. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found \\"a virtual cottage industry\\" of \\"anti-Clinton literature\\" put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints. Some titles include Madame Hillary: The Dark Road to the White House, Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well (other than her memoirs and those of her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her. Don Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable \\"bogeyman\\" to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy, and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich. Clinton has also been featured in the media and popular culture in a wide spectrum of perspectives. In 1995, writer Todd S. Purdum of The New York Times characterized Clinton as a Rorschach test, an assessment echoed at the time by feminist writer and activist Betty Friedan, who said, \\"Coverage of Hillary Clinton is a massive Rorschach test of the evolution of women in our society.\\" She has been the subject of many satirical impressions on Saturday Night Live, beginning with her time as the first lady. She has made guest appearances on the show herself, in 2008 and in 2015, to face-off with her doppelgängers. Jonathan Mann wrote songs about her including \\"The Hillary Shimmy Song\\", which went viral. Clinton in April 2015 She has often been described in the popular media as a polarizing figure, though some argue otherwise.For sources describing her as a polarizing figure, see Purdum, \\"The First Lady's Newest Role\\", op. cit.; ; ; ; ; and those referenced in . For sources arguing against the notion, see the same Davis piece; and In the early stages of her 2008 presidential campaign, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her with two checkboxes labeled \\"Love Her\\", \\"Hate Her\\". Mother Jones titled its profile of her \\"Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary\\". Following Clinton's \\"choked up moment\\" and related incidents in the run-up to the January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed up the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying the New Hampshire events, \\"brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics\\". Once she became secretary of state, Clinton's image seemed to improve dramatically among the American public and become one of a respected world figure. Her favorability ratings dropped, however, after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics once more. By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever. During 2016 she acknowledged that: \\"I'm not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed.\\" Electoral history = 2000 senate election = = 2006 senate election = = 2008 presidential election = = 2016 presidential election = Books and recordings * It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us (1996).

Sironen decided that he \\"never got to touch the ball enough\\" and, after the first season ended, he moved back to Australia. He joined the Balmain Tigers and, in his debut year, he was named as the Dally M Rookie of the Year. In the 1988 season, Sironen played in the Grand Final in which Balmain were defeated by twenty four points to twelve by the Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs. The following year the club again made the Grand Final. Sironen scored a try just before half time to give the Tigers a 12–2 lead, but his club again lost the Grand Final, this time by nineteen points to fourteen against the Canberra Raiders. In the 1990 season, he was named as the Dally M Second-rower of the Year. At the end of the 1990 NSWRL season, he went on the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Sironen was offered a two-year deal by the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks worth $500,000 a season but he opted to stay with Balmain. At the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. At the start of the 1995 season he was named as the captain of the club but he resigned as club captain after six rounds of the competition, in order to focus more specifically on his own game. Sironen surpassed Garry Jack's club record for the most first grade games. At the end of the 1998 season, Sironen left the club to finish out his career for French club US Villeneuve. In total he played 246 matches for the Tigers scoring twenty-two tries for a total of 88 points. He was named as a starting second rower in the Wests Tigers Team of the Century as well as the Balmain Team of the Century. In France, where he was affectionately known as \\"the beast\\", Sironen helped his club Villeneuve-sur-Lot to victory in the final of the 1999 French championship season. Representative career =New South Wales= Sironen made his State of Origin debut for NSW in Game 1 of the 1989 series. In total he made fourteen appearances for New South Wales from 1989 to 1994, although he failed to score a single point in his State of Origin career. =Australia= In his first season in professional rugby league, Sironen was called up to the Australian squad to play against Papua New Guinea and a test match against France, as well as being selected for the 1986 Kangaroo Tour. In 1988 he was selected to play in Australia's World Cup campaign, including the final on 9 October 1988 at Eden Park in which Australia defeated New Zealand by 25–12.1988 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project In 1989, Sironen played in two Test matches on the tour of New Zealand, and in 1990 made a further two Test appearances, against France and New Zealand. He again was selected for the Kangaroo Tour in 1990, where he was a stand out performer in the 2-1 Ashes series win against Great Britain and the two-game sweep of France. Although he was injured for the majority of the 1991 season, he did manage to play for Australia during the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, helping the Kangaroos retain The Ashes, winning man-of-the-match award in the third and deciding Test at Lang Park in Brisbane. Sironen was selected for the 1992 Rugby League World Cup Final, played at the famous Wembley Stadium in London in which Australia defeated Great Britain 10–6. In the 1993–94 season, Sironen had to overcome back problems to be included in the Australian squad for their three test series against New Zealand. He became just the fourth forward in the history of the game to make a third Kangaroo Tour in 1994. He was involved in controversy, after being hit by an elbow in a club game against Wigan at Central Park by British forward Barrie McDermott, and later in the tour was sent off in the match against St. Helens. Altogether Sironen made 21 appearances for his country, scoring three tries. His last test appearance was on the 1994 Kangaroo tour where he came off the bench against Great Britain at Old Trafford in Manchester. Coach Bob Fulton had originally dropped Sirro from the side that lost 8–4 at Wembley, but he got a recall due to an injury to David Fairleigh. Sironen in 2012  Life outside rugby league  Affectionately known as \\"Siro\\" during his playing days, he was also a former police officer and American footballer prior to his career with the Balmain Tigers. Most recently, he has branched out into business as part of the Krispy Kreme management team in Australia. Sironen is the only original model left on Lowes Menswear television commercials which also feature Darryl Brohman and Matt Ballin, who replaced the other original models Steve \\"Blocker\\" Roach, Paul Vautin and Ray Hadley. While playing football, Sironen also served in the New South Wales Police Force and in 2008, rugby league's centenary year in Australia, he was named at second-row in a NSW Police team of the century.

As an Islamic state, the production of plays and theatrical performances in the past was not condoned in the country for religious reasons that is why this performing art did not have the opportunity to develop and flourish. The concept of Pakistani theater as a national heritage could only be traced back to modern plays due to the absence of any classical theatrical tradition while folk literature has also been largely obscured except the performances of the Bhand.  Background  With the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1998, 516). Pakistan, like its Middle Eastern neighbors, did not condone the performing arts except the popular performances of comic dialogues that crudely displayed the female body. Later, however, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across South Asia, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1998, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12). The history of theatre beginning this period coincided with- and often mirrored the political developments in Pakistan. Theater groups, for instance, performed repertoires that depicted and challenged extremism as well as biased notions of nationalism, religion, and gender.  Urdu theater  The modern theatre in Pakistan, which emerged in 1853, is equated with the Urdu-language theater. It was developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.Richmond (1998, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13). The performance of the play Inder Sabha (The Heavenly Court of Indra) written by Agha Hasan Amanat in the court of the last Nawab of Oudh, Wajid Ali Shah in 1855, has been highly regarded as the beginning of Urdu theatre.South Asian arts:: Theatre in Pakistan - Britannica Online Encyclopediadubious - discuss] There is a controversy with regards to whether Urdu theater was influenced by Western sources or mainly a product of Urdu's literary tradition. There are historians, for instance, who proposed that the style of Inder Sabha had elements that can be traced to the French, a position that Masud Hasan Rizvi rejected. This Indian author claimed that Urdu literature is patterned after ancient Sanskrit plays. Today, Pakistan has a growing theatre culture, and Urdu theater competes with English plays for dominance in the country's entertainment industry.Theatre in Pakistan: From English to Urdu The major competition with theatre is that represented by growing television industry and the spread of films produced in the Pakistani film industry based in Karachi and Lahore, known as \\"Lollywood\\". Lack of finance is another major obstacle. Inder Sabha In 1855, the enactment of the play Inder Sabha written by Agha Hasan Amanat in the court of the last Nawab of Oudh, Wajid Ali Shah, marked the beginning of Urdu theatre. The drama dealt with the love story between a fairy and a prince. The Nawab, who was a Kathak dancer and had written theses on stage techniques, composed some of the songs and choreographed the dances for the play. It was a huge success. Its characters (Sabaz Pari (Green Fairy), Kala Deo (Black Devil) and Lal Deo (Red Devil)) live on as a part of the vocabulary of South Asia.South Asian arts:: Theatre in Pakistan - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Post independence theatre =Pakistani literature= The distinct voice of Pakistani literature came soon after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. Since there were many cultural similarities, Urdu and English Literature was inherited by this new state. Over due course, a literature which was somewhat uniquely Pakistani has emerged in every province. Initially the plays were all about the Pakistan Movement and the Persecution of Muslims and anti-Muslim pogroms during the independence by the Hindus and Sikhs. This gradually began to change in 1960s and the current trend is specifically Pakistani venturing into many different genres. =Saadat Hasan Manto= Manto is arguably the most influential Urdu writer of the 20th century. He was one of the most controversial as well. His work is comparable with D. H. Lawrence. This comparison is made because like Lawrence he also wrote about the topics considered social taboos of his Society. He addressed topics ranging from the socio-economic injustice prevailing in pre- and post-colonial South Asia; he stirred up quite a fury when he wrote about controversial topics of love, sex, incest, prostitution and the typical hypocrisy of a traditional South Asian male. In dealing with these topics, he wasn’t careful to conceal any of the facts and clearly showed the true state of affairs. His short stories were often intricately structured, with vivid satire and a good sense of humor. Manto was a well known film writer of the Indian cinema and was making good money. He however, chose to abandon his lucrative career and migrated to Pakistan. In the seven years that Manto lived in Lahore he continuously struggled for survival. However, he proved to be a productive individual who gave some of his best writings to the literary world regardless of his domestic situation. It was in Lahore that he wrote many of his best known works. Manto was primarily known for his short stories of the South Asia, great literature out of the events relating to the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The literature, which came out of the period that followed, is considered to have been progressive in its tone and spirit. According to several critics it had not only evolved its own identity, but also had played a significant role in documenting the hardships and hopes of Pakistan in the latter part of the 20th century. Manto also wrote plays and many of his stories have been successfully adapted for the stage. Some of his characters have become legends in the minds of theatergoers. =Umer Shareef= During the late 1980s Umer Sharif became the most well known stage performer in Pakistan after his extremely popular 1989 comedy stage plays Bakra Qistoon Pay and Buddha Ghar Pe Hai. In both he starred with another comedy legend Moin Akhter. Bakra Qistoon Pay is considered by critics in India & Pakistan to be the show that made stage plays what they are today in Pakistan. Before the advent of Bakra Qistoon Pay majority stage shows in Pakistan used to be classy with rather poetic dialogs. After Bakra Qistoon Pay stage shows became a vibrant, majorly comical (and often gritty) part of the Pakistani culture. Sharif now host a program The Shareef Show Mubarak Ho on Geo TV. =Farrukh Nigar Aziz= The daughter of Abdul Aziz Falakpaima, Farrukh Nigar Aziz was a known literary figure even before the independence of Pakistan in 1947. She and her sisters were educated along liberal styles of education. These women received opportunities that were somewhat of a rarity in their day. Formal education for Muslim women and having a career in the arts or performing arts was considered not respectable. Types of theatre The general complaint in conservative circles is that commercial theatre is lowbrow and thrives on obscene dialogue and dances. The fact is that at least three departments are tasked with monitoring the activities of commercial theatre. From the Punjab Arts Council, which is responsible for vetting the scripts to District Coordination Officers, who are authorized to monitor the screening of plays, to the Home Department that actually takes action against producers, directors, artistes and theatre owners, the dice is loaded against entertainment at every step.\\" Karachi is also creating theatre of all forms especial karachi arts council setting examples of quality theatre and required literature for theatre on the other hand Napa ( National academy of performing arts) nurturing talents in all the domains and forms of theatre. both conduct theatre festivals on regular basis that's not provide quality entertainment to citizen but also develop their curiosity to literature and arts. and provide opportunities to the artist in all forms. =Local theatre= Commercial theatre is surviving this accusation and, in some cases, even thriving this shows that people want entertainment and are prepared to watch plays despite the hazards of doing so. Just like any demand and supply situation, since there is a demand there will be a supply. The arrival of commercial theatre in Lahore was in the early 1980s. The joint efforts of Naheed Khanum, Amanullah, Mastana and Baboo Baral ushered in the art the lively dialogues and innovative style was like a breath of fresh air for the citizens. The initial venue for the staging of these plays was Alhamra but a replacement venue had to be sought once Alhamra closed down for renovations in 1981–1982. Each and every script has to be cleared by the Punjab Arts Council (PAC). Lahore has five private (Tamaseel, Mehfil, Naz, Crown and Alfalah) and a government theatre (Alhamra). The moral citizens were scandalized by the low-quality, obscene and vulgar shows called for the closure of commercial theatre have become common in Gujranwala, Faislabad, Multan and Sahiwal. Most of the complaints originate from religious conservative populace while mostly male crowd enjoy these performances. In Lahore, most of the audience come from other cities. The theatres are packed on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. A stage play usually runs for 16 days and earns around two million rupees in that time. Tickets cost from Rs. 200 to Rs. 1, Training institutions =Punjab Lok Rahs= Punjab Lok Rahs started working as an independent alternative theater group in 1986. The group has seen a number of upheavals both internal and external during its history. On average, the group has held a performance every fortnight since its creation. It started as a group of young men and women, primarily students, that was concerned with the military oppression of arts and cultural activities in Pakistan. The group cherished a society that has gender equity and democratic values, respects all humans and offers equal economic opportunities to all. Rahs believes in organized and conscious efforts to realize this dream. Theater is its medium. Rahs’ experience in the art of theatre is very deep as well. From staging classical epics to quick response street skits and from working out foreign adaptations to improvising ones with community and from performing at overseas festivals to villages and urban slums, Rahs has touched upon a host of issues. Rahs’ canvas is very wide and diverse as it has dealt with subjects like child marriage and women’s right to marry of their free will and staged plays against arms race and military dictatorship. Besides experimentation and experience, Rahs has learned theatre from its gurus like Badal Sarkar. Its members have received training from many institutions in other countries. The group has imparted theatre training to a number of civil society organizations as well. It has supported scores of other organizations by performing for the communities with which they work. Rahs draws inspiration from Punjab’s indigenous theatre tradition. Its name ‘Rahs’ is the Punjabi word for local form of theatre and its logo shows the basic props of this theatre. The group aims to marry the tradition with modern techniques and concepts and make it an effective tool in the hands of organizations working for social change. Rahs performs plays only in the mother language of its audience – the people of Punjab. The group believes that the mother language lies at the heart of the issue of cultural identity. The group not only performs but also trains other dramatic societies and community organizations to do theatre as an art and use it as an effective tool of communication. =Napa (National academy of performing arts, Karachi)= NAPA is a performing arts school located at Hindu Gymkhana in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. NAPA was established in 2005 as an institution to conserve and teach performing arts and music. Napa are acutely aware that in every society there is only a small creative minority which keeps the flame of its country's culture alive. This creative minority is the most valuable asset of a society. Napa under leadership of Zia Mohyeddin NAPA empowers its graduates to go forth with zeal to establish and promote a positive regard for higher accomplishment in the Performing Arts. It also provide opportunities to their alumni and students to display their talent through different festivals and in house NRT productions which shows plays on regular basis. It also creates opportunity to citizen of karachi to observe high quality of performing arts, language and literature. NAPA'S mission is to give Pakistan's rich cultural texture its rightful place not just within the country, but in the world. Napa ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Performing_Arts) offered short and long courses in theatre and music where students from all over the pakistan participates. The advent of commercial theatre in Pakistan =Theatre in the capital= Theatre in Pakistan has been given a professional and commercial face by private production companies that attempt to infuse theatre as a cultural norm in the country. In this respect, the Capital has been exceptionally successful, through the support of the Government and Private Investors, to give a platform to the youth to showcase their talent. 2006 alone saw around eight lavish theatrical productions, and was touted as the year of comedy, as residents of the Capital were treated to a liberal dose of humor and farce. Improvisational theatre =The Acting Wheel= The Acting Wheel, founded in Jan 2011, is Karachi's first drama club of its kind. It's not a theater company, or a school of any kind. It's simply a group of people passionate about acting, who meet every other week in Karachi to spontaneously act out. The act-ups or act-olutions (like revolutions of The Acting Wheel) consist of giving out scripts to participants and enabling them to spontaneously act out the scripts creatively. Participants also play acting games frequently, including improv and comedy. The blog talks about each act- up http://theactingwheel.blogspot.com =Black Fish= Founded in 2002, Black Fish was the first of its kind improvisational theatre troupe in Pakistan. It had a huge following and was very popular among the youth. The group catered to all age groups. The troupe used to perform every Sunday but reduced the frequency of their public shows to every fortnight. Even though they did not advertise heavily, the troupe's popularity spread from word of mouth and an occasional radio announcement that helped the shows manage to draw a packed crowd who sometimes had no place to sit, thus, resorting to sitting on the stairs. Despite being a Karachi-based group, Black Fish managed to take its performances to other Pakistani cities such as Lahore, Islamabad and even Faisalabad. In 2004 Black Fish was also selected by the British Council to represent Pakistan in an International Youth Theatre Festival Manchester called Contacting The World. The troupe has worked with Pakistan's leading English Newspaper, Dawn, to put together the first ever Comedy Festival which was held in Karachi in November 2006. The group has since disbanded and 'Sami Shah', a member of the group is now a standup comedian. =Modern and Cultural Theater= Few names that come up who are still making Theater alive in Pakistan, After Ajoka Theatre and Punjab Lok Rahs, we have individual personalities who are teaching and doing theatre in Pakistan to make us proud. Omair Rana is an Actor/Director/Producer/Teacher/Trainer. Osman Khalid Butt is a Writer [poetry, short prose, film], actor [theatre & film], Director, choreographer & vlogger based in Islamabad who drinks too much Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster for his own good. His forever immortalized performances are \\"Moulin Rouge\\", \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"The Pillowman\\" and Many more.

The play was selected as Pakistan's entry to the Cultural Olympiad preceding the London Olympics and was performed at the Globe (Also known as Shakespeare Globe), London to rave reviews. =School plays= Each year, the Old Grammarians Society (OGS) gets together and puts up a play at the PACC. These plays are usually in English and the audiences are mostly Grammarians. These plays act as sort of a reunion for all the current students to get together in a single place and feel a sense of unity with their predecessors. The plays consist of actors who are the alumni of the old school and are to a degree quite seasoned in their vocation. The props and settings of the plays are of a high standard and this explains the cost of the tickets which range from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1000 or more. This explains the kind of audience that is expected. These plays are popularized through word of mouth. =Foreign theatre companies= At the Lahore World Performing Arts Festival the Euro Theatre Central performed for the fifth time. It had performed a German play dialogues of which were learnt by the troupe in English for the benefit of the local audience. The play entitled \\"Liebesgeflüster\\" (Raaz and Nias) from Bonn to Lahore. The sponsor of the festival was Rafi Peer. This attracted a huge amount of attention from the locals. The German ambassador even made the journey from Islamabad for the Pakistani premier. There were artists from Switzerland, Germany and the Wall Street Theatre group from Cologne/Aachen with its Anglo-Saxon two-man artistic comedy show is perfect proof of the fact that humour. A youth group from Uzbekistan was also present along with many Indian and Pakistani dancers and performers.

The story tells itself in two parallel parts: one of the stories is during his time in the asylum, all a memory slowly bringing itself back to life; the other story takes place after he is released, and he feels compelled to author a book on the events surrounding that murder. He has no paper, so he writes his story on the wall and is constantly challenged with tedious interruptions. At the same time, he forgoes his medication, and the tension of continuing with his work becomes threatened by his struggle with his own madness.

The forming of corporate groups usually involves consolidation via mergers and acquisitions, although the group concept focuses on the instances in which the merged and acquired corporate entities remain in existence rather than the instances in which they are dissolved by the parent. The group may be owned by a holding company which may have no actual operations. In Germany, where a sophisticated law of the \\"concern\\" has been developed, the law of corporate groups is a fundamental aspect of its corporate law. Many other European jurisdictions also have a similar approach, while Commonwealth countries and the United States adhere to a formalistic doctrine that refuses to \\"pierce the corporate veil\\": corporations are treated outside tax and accounting as wholly separate legal entities. Legal independence A corporate group is composed of companies. The general rule is that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders, that is the shareholder's liability for the subsidiary's debts is limited to the value of the shares,Salomon v Salomon and the shareholders cannot be required to perform the company's obligations. However, some jurisdictions create exceptions to this rule. For example, Germany has created affiliated enterprise law which provides situations in which one company is liable for the debts of another company. In New Zealand, the Companies Act provides that the assets of related companies may be pooled to pay the creditors if one of the companies is liquidated. However, the circumstances in which this power will be exercised are very narrow.Lewis Holdings Ltd vs Steel & Tube Holdings Ltd [2014] NZHC 3311 *Berkey v Third Avenue Railway Economic dependence *Concern (business) *DHN v Tower Hamlets LBC *EU Seventh Company Law Directive 83/349, on group accounts *EU Draft Ninth Company Law Directive, on corporate groups Law =Tax= =Accounting= *EU Seventh Company Law Directive 83/349, on group accounts =Civil law= *Salomon v Salomon *Berkey v Third Avenue Railway *Adams v Cape Industries plc =Codetermination= *Mitbestimmungsgesetz Definition LeffLeff 1978:663 defines business group as a group of companies that does business in different markets under common administrative or financial control whose members are linked by relations of interpersonal trust on the basis of similar personal ethnic or commercial background.

Powell and Smith-DoerrSmith-Doerr 1994:388 state that a business group is a network of firms that regularly collaborate over a long time period. Granovetter argues that business groups refers to an intermediate level of binding, excluding on the one hand a set of firms bound merely by short-term alliances and on the other a set of firms legally consolidated into a single unit.

He was a representative in the Australian national team and star player with the Balmain Tigers. Jack was a for the Tigers during the late 1980s, and early 1990s, under the captaincy of Wayne Pearce and the coaching of Warren Ryan. Jack also represented the New South Wales State of Origin team on 17 occasions. Club career Jack commenced his first grade career with Western Suburbs Magpies in 1981. The following year he moved to Balmain Tigers where he played for the rest of his Australian first grade career. His association with English rugby league began at the end of the 1986 Kangaroo tour when he stayed on to play for Salford before returning to the Tigers. He was member of the consecutive Balmain teams which fell at the final hurdle to firstly Canterbury-Bankstown in the 1988 Grand Final and then to Canberra in 1989. 1991 saw the departure of Warren Ryan as Balmain coach and the arrival of former Wallaby coach, Alan Jones. The years playing under Jones at Balmain were unhappy ones for Jack and eventually after he had left the club in 1992 and launched an attack on Jones’ ability as a coach following his ‘surprise’ reappointment for a third year.http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/s551929.htm When his Australian club career ended having surpassed Keith Barnes' club record for first grade matches , he returned to England to play his final season with the Sheffield Eagles. Representative career In the 1984 State of Origin series Jack made his New South Wales début and played in all three games of that year's series. He was thereafter the Blues' first choice fullback for the next six years, aside from the 1987 fourth game exhibition match in Los Angeles when he made himself unavailable, and game I of 1988 when Cronulla's Jonathon Docking was preferred. Jack made 17 appearances for New South Wales in State of Origin series between 1984 and 1989. In 1984, he also made his international début in the three match Ashes series against Great Britain. He played twenty successive Tests (nine versus Britain, seven against New Zealand and two each against France and Papua New Guinea) as well as the 1988 World Cup Final against New Zealand and the Bicentenary International against a Rest of the World team. On the 1986 Kangaroo tour, Jack played in all six Tests and seven minor Tour matches. He became the first Australian fullback to score three tries in a Test against France in the second Test. On 20 July 1988, Jack played for Australia in their record 62-point win over Papua New Guinea, scoring a try. After Jack broke an arm in a 1989 pre-season match the door opened for his State of Origin rival Queenslander Gary Belcher who from that point was the favoured Australian representative for the fullback position. Post playing Jack was appointed coach of English club Salford in July '93 but departed following their relegation from the top flight at the end of the 1994–95 Rugby Football League season. Personal life Jack's sons Kieren and Brandon both played for the Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League.http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/08/brandon-jack-an-afl-bolter-like- kieren/ Another son, Rhys Jack, played in the Bulldogs Toyota Cup (Under-20s) team and Balmain in the New South Wales Cup.

He was court painter of king John III Sobieski and a Polish–Lithuanian noble. He is considered one of the most accomplished painters of Classical Baroque in Poland, who joined in his works classical theory with genuine motives. Life and professional career Siemiginowski was of Armenian origin. He was born in Lwów (Lviv) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (today part of Ukraine) and was the son of a painter Jerzy Szymonowicz and Teodozja née Korunka. In 1677 he was entrusted to the king John III Sobieski by his parents and was sent by the king to Rome. Before he went to Rome he probably spent at least a year, possibly two, in Paris. In 1682 due to recommendation of king John III he was admitted to Accademia di San Luca in Rome, he receive the Knighthood of the Golden Spur and the title of Eques Auratus from the Pope Innocent XI. On 11 January 1682 he also took first place award in the Academy's contest for two of his drawings Construction of the Tower of Babel, and God's anger caused by the building of a tower and was protected by the Pope's nephew Livio Odescalchi. In Rome he was trained by Lazzaro Baldi, Luigi Garzi and Carlo Maratta. Plafond Allegory of Autumn, 1681-1682 Shortly after his return to Poland in 1684 he was ennobled by the king and took the name of Chevalier Eleuter (Greek for free, independent). In 1687 John III granted him the village Łuka near Złoczów (Zolochiv) to confirm his nobility. After king's death he became secretary of Augustus II the Strong and was a court painter of Aleksander Benedykt Sobieski. At that time he still worked in Wilanów (Sobieski's suburban palace) and supervised the construction of new palace's wings. In 1701 he was adopted by the impoverished noble family of Siemiginowski (he paid them lot of money for this privilege) and since that time he used their name. Siemiginowski was married four times and had 11 children. In 1704 he had a house in Warsaw and a manor house at Wielopole near Warsaw. He died probably between February 28, 1708 and March 13, 1711. Siemiginowski-Eleuter was the main artist who was responsible for decorating and painting of the interior of Wilanów Palace in Warsaw. His painting was heavily influenced by French artists of the Baroque. Similarities with plafonds by Charles Le Brun in his works (especially ceiling painting in Pavillon de l'Aurore in suburban Paris residence of Jean-Baptiste Colbert at Sceaux, 1671 or 1672) making his visit in Paris more probable. Influences of Carlo Maratta and Nicolas Poussin are also visible in his works (especially in his plafond Allegory of Spring in the Queen's Bedroom inspired by Maratta's Flora and Changes in the Kingdom of Flora by Poussin). He painted antiquitised portraits of the members of the royal family and made engravings in participation of Charles de La Haye. Siemiginowski painted many frescoes, notable for their many colors. His subject matter varied between dramatic scenes to peaceful landscapes. Among the most notable of his works are four plafonds of the four seasons in the Wilanów Palace. Siemiginowski established his own school of painting in Wilanów and was a renowned architect (participated in designing of the Town Hall in Żółkiew (Zhovkva)). Many of his religious paintings in Warsaw (Crucifixion in the Holy Cross Church, Transfiguration in the Capuchin Church among others) were destroyed during the extensive bombardment of the city by the Germans in 1944.

An earlier system, the Livermore Time Sharing System had been developed over a decade earlier. NLTSS ran initially on a CDC 7600 computer, but only ran production from about 1985 until 1994 on Cray computers including the Cray-1, Cray X-MP, and Cray Y-MP models. Characteristics The NLTSS operating system was unusual in many respects and unique in some. =Low-level architecture= NLTSS was a microkernel message passing system. It was unique in that only a single system call was supported by the kernel of the system. That system call, which might be called \\"communicate\\" (it didn't have a name because it didn't need to be distinguished from other system calls) accepted a list of \\"buffer tables\\" (e.g. see The NLTSS Message System Interface) that contained control information for message communication – either sends or receives. Such communication, both locally within the system and across a network was all the kernel of the system supported directly for user processes. The \\"message system\\" (supporting the one call and the network protocols) and drivers for the disks and processor composed the entire kernel of the system. =Mid-level architecture= NLTSS was a capability-based client–server system. The two primary servers were the file server and the process server. The file server was a process privileged to be trusted by the drivers for local storage (disk storage,) and the process server was a process privileged to be trusted by the processor driver (software that switched time sharing control between processes in the \\"alternator\\", handled interrupts for processes besides the \\"communicate\\" call, provided access to memory and process state for the process server, etc.). NLTSS was a true network operating system in that its resource requests could come from local processes or remote processes anywhere on the network and the servers didn't distinguish them. A server's only means to make such distinctions would be by network address and they had no reason to make such distinctions. All requests to the servers appeared as network requests. Communication between processes in NLTSS by convention used the LINCS (Livermore Interactive Network Communication System) protocol suite, which defined a protocol stack along the lines of that defined by the OSI reference model. The transport level protocol for NLTSS and LINCS was called Delta-T. At the presentation level LINCS defined standards for communicating numbered parameters as tokens (e.g. integers, capabilities, etc.) that were stored in a session level record for processing in a remote procedure call sort of mechanism. The notion of a \\"user\\" was only rather peripherally defined in NLTSS. There was an \\"account server\\" that kept track of which users were using which resources (e.g. requests to create objects such as file or processes required such an account capability). Access control was entirely managed with capabilities (communicable authority tokens). =File server= Any process could make requests to the file server for the creation of files (returning a file capability), ask to read or write files (by presenting a file capability), etc. For example, the act of reading a file generally required three buffer tables, one to send the request to the file server, one to receive the reply from the file server, and one to receive the data from the file. These three requests were generally submitted at one time to the message system, sometimes bundled with other requests. Control bits could be set in the buffer tables to awaken (unblock) a process whenever any of the buffer tables submitted were marked \\"Done\\". A library call to read a file would typically block until the control reply was received from the file server, though asynchronous I/O would of course not block and could check or block later. Any such differences on the user side were invisible to the file server. =Process server= In NLTSS the process server was quite similar to the file server in that user processes could ask for the creation of processes, the starting or stopping of processes, reading or writing process memory or registers, and to be notified of process faults. The process server was an ordinary user mode process that was simply trusted to communicate with the CPU driver, just like the file server was trusted to communicate with the disk driver. The process server stored process state in files provided by the file server and in that regard appeared like any other user process to the file server. =Directory server= An example higher level server in NLTSS was the directory server. This server's task was to essentially turn files (invisible to the user) into directories that could be used to store and retrieve capabilities by name. Since capabilities were simply data this wasn't a particularly difficult task – consisting mostly of manipulating access permissions on the capabilities according to the conventions defined in the LINCS protocol suite. One place where this got a bit interesting was regarding an access permission called \\"inheritance\\". If this bit was on (allowed) then capabilities could be fetched with their full access from the directory. If this bit was turned off (disallowed) then any permissions turned off in the directory capability were in turn turned off in the capability being feteched before it was returned to the requesting application. This mechanism allowed people to store, for example, read/write files in a directory, but to give other users only permission to fetch read-only instances of them. Development The bulk of the programming for NLTSS was done in a Pascal extension developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory known as \\"Model\\". Model extended Pascal to include an abstract data type (object) mechanism and some other features. NLTSS was saddled with a compatibility legacy. NLTSS followed the development and deployment of the LTSS (Livermore Time Sharing System) in the Livermore Computer Center at LLNL (~1968–1988?). NLTSS development started about the same time LTSS was ported to the Cray-1 to become the Cray Time Sharing System. To stay backward compatible with the many scientific applications at LLNL, NLTSS was forced to emulate the prior LTSS operating system's system calls. This emulation was implemented in the form of a compatibility library called \\"baselib\\". As one example, while the directory structure and thus the process structure for NLTSS was naturally a directed graph (process capabilities could be stored in directories just like file capabilities or directory capabilities), the baselib library emulated a simple linear (controller – controllee) process structure (not even a tree structure as in Unix) to stay compatible with the previous LTSS. Since scientific users never accessed NLTSS services outside the baselib library, NLTSS ended up looking nearly exactly like LTSS to its users. Most users weren't aware of capabilities, didn't realize that they could access resources across the network, and generally weren't aware that NLTSS offered any services beyond those of LTSS. NLTSS did support shared memory symmetric multiprocessing, a development that paralleled a similar development in the Cray Time Sharing System. Even the name NLTSS was something of a legacy. The \\"New Livermore Time Sharing System\\" name was initially considered a temporary name to use during development. Once the system began to run some applications in a \\"dual system\\" mode (sort of a virtual machine sharing drivers with LTSS) a more permanent name, LINOS (LIncs Network Operating System), was chosen by the developers. Unfortunately, the management at LLNL decided that the name couldn't be changed at that point (seemingly because the previous term had been used in budget requests) so the temporary development \\"NLTSS\\" name stayed with the system throughout its lifetime. A mass storage system was also developed in parallel with NLTSS that used the LINCS protocols (same file and directory protocols as NLTSS). This system/software was later commercialized as the Unitree product. Unitree was generally superseded by the High Performance Storage System that could loosely be considered a legacy of LINCS and NLTSS. For example, LINCS and NLTSS introduced a form of third party transfer (to copy file to file in NLTSS a process could send two requests to file servers, one to read and one to write and direct the file servers to transfer the data between themselves) that carried through in modified form to Unitree and HPSS. Implementation and design issues The biggest knock against NLTSS during its production lifetime was performance. The one performance issue that affected users most was file access latency. This generally wasn't a significant problem for disk I/O, but the systems that NLTSS ran on also supported a significant complement of very low latency solid state disks with access times under 10 microseconds. The initial latencies for file operations under NLTSS were comparable to the latency for solid state disk access and significantly higher than the LTSS latency for such access. To improve file access latency under NLTSS the implementation was changed significantly to put the most latency sensitive processes (in particular the file server) \\"in the kernel\\". This effort wasn't as significant as it might at first sound as all NLTSS servers worked on a multithreading model. What this change really amounted to was to move the threads responsible for file server services from a separate file server process into the kernel \\"process\\". Communication to users was unchanged (still through buffer tables, LINCS tokens, etc.), but file operations avoided some significant context changes that were the primary cause of the higher latencies over what the older LTSS and the competing Cray Time Sharing System provided. This change did significantly (~3x) improve the latency of file I/O operations, but it also meant that the file server became a trusted part of the kernel (by implementation, not by design). A second implementation issue with NLTSS related to the security/integrity of its capability as data implementation. This implementation used a password capability model (e.g. see Control by Password). With this model any person or process that could get access to the memory space of a process would have the authority to access the capability represented by the data found in that memory. Some system architects (e.g. Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the architect of the Amoeba distributed operating system) have suggested that this property of access to memory implying access to capabilities is not an inherent problem. In the environment of NLTSS it sometimes happened that people took program memory dumps to others for analysis. Because of this and other concerns, such password capabilities were considered a vulnerability in NLTSS. A design was done to protect against this vulnerability, the Control by Public Key Encryption mechanism. This mechanism wasn't put into production in NLTSS both because of its significant performance cost and because users weren't aware of the vulnerability from password capabilities. Modern advances in cryptography would make such protection for capabilities practical, especially for Internet/Web capabilities (e.g. see YURLs or WideWORD).https://wideword.net/ A design issue with NLTSS that wasn't considered until years after it was removed from production was its open network architecture. In NLTSS processes were considered as virtual processors in a network with no firewalls or other restrictions. Any process could communicate freely to any other. This meant that it was not possible to do confinement even in the sense of limiting direct communication (e.g. vs. limiting covert channels such as \\"wall banging\\"). To correct this problem NLTSS would have to require capabilities to enable communication. Late development work on NLTSS such as \\"stream numbers\\" was getting close to such a facility, but by the time active development stopped in 1988 communication in NLTSS was still unconfined.

The school is named after the suburb of Hillcrest for which it serves, although the school itself is actually located in Silverdale. Opened in 1972, the school has a roll of students as of . making it the second-largest school in Hamilton. History Hillcrest High School is the youngest of the ten state and state-integrated secondary schools in Hamilton, opening for instruction for the first time in January 1972, although it plans to be superseded by a new secondary school at Rototuna in about 2016. Like many New Zealand state secondary schools built in the 1970s, Hillcrest was built to the S68 standard design. The school has three full- sized S68 blocks (B, C, and D blocks) and one half-sized S68 block (western half of E block – the eastern half is a later addition). Enrolment At the April 2013 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, Hillcrest High School had 1630 students, including 35 international students. The school roll's gender composition was 47% male and 53% female, and its ethnic composition was 52% New Zealand European (Pākehā), 20.5% Asian, 14% Māori, 7% other European, and 4% Pacific Islanders. Curriculum The school examines students using the New Zealand standard, National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). Cambridge examinations for Mathematics and English are also available for able Year 12 students. A wide variety of subjects can be taken at Hillcrest High, ranging from Visual Art to Mechanics, international languages as well as standard subjects such as English, Mathematics and Science. Hillcrest High is reasonably well known because of its academic success. In 2005, Hillcrest students received a total of 54 scholarships, the sixth highest number of scholarships of any high school in the North Island. Seven Hillcrest students received Top Scholar Awards from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority between 2002–5. A student in 2008 scored 99% in the Cambridge English exam, achieving the highest score in the world. Extracurricular cultural activities Hillcrest High often puts on regular concerts and other cultural events. Below, is a brief list of the regular events: *ILC Concert, held in August every year, hosted by Assistant Principal, Mrs. Sue Radford. *International Concert is held yearly also, in March. The International Concert is held to recognise the multi-culturalness of Hillcrest High. International cuisine can also be sampled beforehand. *School productions is also a regular, three yearly event. Usually a musical and held at a Hamilton City theatre. These musicals have included Seussical (2006), a musical based on Dr.Seuss's works, Spamalot (2009), a musical based on Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The most recent musical was The Little Mermaid (2018). *There are also drama productions held usually at least once a school term. This will usually include a Shakespeare production, a 6th form production and a 7th form production. Student groups and clubs Involvement in cultural activities is an important part of Hillcrest High School. Annual events include the school production and an International Concert that reflects the multiculturalism of the school. The school has social interest groups, including United Nations Youth, Amnesty International, Students Against Drunk Driving, Greenpeace and an Eastside Pentecostal Christian Group and a Bible Society Bible study group.

Operational history At 1800 hours on 23 June 1941, Natsushio collided with the destroyers and in Bungo Channel. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Natsushio, was assigned to Destroyer Division 15 (Desdiv 15), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Palau, as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier in the invasion of the southern Philippines and minelayer . In early 1942, Natsushio participated in the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting the invasion forces for Menado, Kendari and Ambon in January. During the invasion of Makassar on 8–9 February, Natsushio was torpedoed by the United States Navy submarine and sank approximately south of Makassar at coordinates (). Ten crewmen were killed in the attack, and the survivors were rescued by her sister ship . Natsushio was removed from the navy list on 28 February 1942.

Biography Born in Charleston, March 12, 1788; Hayne was the son of William Hayne, a lowland planter, and his wife Elizabeth Peronneau. Hayne was of English and French Huguenot descent. He pursued classical studies, engaged in business, and served in the War of 1812 as a first lieutenant at Sackets Harbor on Lake Ontario, major of cavalry on the St. Lawrence, and inspector general in 1814. He was brevetted lieutenant colonel for gallant conduct at New Orleans. He studied law with Hon. Thomas Duncan in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was admitted to the bar and practiced, and served in the Florida War as commander of the Tennessee Volunteers and retired from the military in 1820. Hayne was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and was United States naval agent in the Mediterranean for five years. He declined the Belgian mission as ambassador, and was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Josiah J. Evans and served from May 11, 1858, to December 2, 1858; he was not a candidate to fill the vacancy. Hayne died in Charleston in 1867; interment was in St. Michael's Churchyard, Charleston. Military career Arthur Hayne began his military career in 1807. When the frigate Chesapeake was attacked, he secured a commission as first lieutenant in a regiment of light dragoons, commanded by Colonel Wade Hampton of Revolutionary war fame. In 1809, he was sent by Hampton to Mississippi, where he laid the Foundation for his later career. He fought in the battle of Sacket's Harbor, was brevetted major for gallantry in action, accompanied General Wilkinson down the St. Lawrence in the contemplated attack on Montreal and also served with General Brown. In 1814 he became Inspector General, with orders to join General Andrew Jackson in the Creek nation. In the absence of Colonel Butler, he also acted as adjutant general. Jackson sent him to Fort Montgomery to organize forces for an attack upon Pensacola. In the storming of the city, Colonel Hayne was one of the first to take possession of an enemy battery under heavy fire. After its fall, he was placed in charge of the city. In the famous Battle of New Orleans, Hayne selected the site for Jackson's defense and had much to do with repulsing the British and saving the city, as did Major Wade Hampton of Columbia. After the battle, Jackson sent Hayne to Washington to secure additional troops for the continued defense of the city, not realizing the war had ended. During the war, he was thrice brevetted for bravery. Family Arthur Hayne was the older brother of Robert Young Hayne, also a U.S. Senator and Governor of South Carolina; famous for the Webster-Hayne Debate over States' rights and held over several days in the U.S. Senate in 1830. He was a cousin of Isaac Hayne, hanged by the British during the Revolution, and uncle of the poet and editor Paul Hamilton Hayne. Arthur Hayne married Frances Gibson Duncan, daughter of Hon. Thomas Duncan of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (1817–1827). He married second, Elizabeth Laura Alston, daughter of William Alston of Charleston, South Carolina. His only child Frances Duncan Hayne married Lloyd James Beall, a former United States Army officer from Rhode Island who sided with the Confederacy and served as Commandant of the Confederate States Marine Corps.

The name Puhoi is translated as \\"slow water\\". (Compare the Māori word , meaning \\"be slow, sluggish, unhurried.\\") It was settled by Europeans on 29 June 1863 by a group of German-speaking migrants from Staab (modern Stod) in Bohemia, now a province of the Czech Republic, under the leadership of Captain Martin Krippner. This has given it the appellation of \\"Bohemian Settlement\\". Altogether three batches of migrants arrived between 1863 and 1866. The migrants were allocated parcels of land by the colonial government. However, when the migrants arrived, the land was covered with forest, which they had to set about clearing before they could begin to use the land.Muller, G. (2004, July 6). “Paddling the Puhoi.” NZ Herald. Retrieved from https:// www.nzherald.co.nz The original settlers were all of the Roman Catholic faith and one of the first things they turned their attention to was constructing a church. This was completed in 1881 and dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul whose feast day in the Catholic calendar falls on 29 June, the date of the arrival of the first settlers. The church still stands today and serves the community. The hotel and general store also have their origins from the times of the first settlers. There is a museum which occupies premises that were originally built as the Catholic primary school (1923–1964).

It is Brown's second novel to include the character Robert Langdon: the first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons. The Da Vinci Code follows \\"symbologist\\" Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris causes them to become involved in a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene having had a child together. The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the Merovingian kings of France were descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's The Templar Revelation (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material. The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Catholic Church, and consistently criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracies. The novel nonetheless became a massive worldwide bestsellerWyat, Edward (November 4, 2005). \\"'Da Vinci Code' Losing Best-Seller Status\\" .

In 2006, a film adaptation was released by Columbia Pictures. Plot Louvre curator and Priory of Sion grand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the \\"keystone,\\" an item crucial in the search for the Holy Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order. Langdon explains to Fache that Saunière was a leading authority on the subject of goddess artwork and that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter, and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said \\"P.S. Find Robert Langdon,\\" which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival. However, \\"P.S.\\" actually refers to Sophie, as the nickname given to her by her grandfather is \\"Princess Sophie\\". It does not refer to \\"postscript\\". Neveu is troubled by memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group. However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads them to a safe deposit box at the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. Google Da Vinci Code Quest Contest Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find a box containing the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password. Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of Mary Magdalene. The trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spell out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier. Arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnesses a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she is shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who are wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She flees the house and breaks off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as hieros gamos or \\"sacred marriage.\\" By the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and bore children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is \\"apple.\\" Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sect Opus Dei and Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound. The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life. The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below the La Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the \\"Rose Line,\\" an allusion to \\"Rosslyn.\\" Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line to La Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as the Templar knights did before him.

The TFP acronym in the banner stands for the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property. The book generated criticism when it was first published for inaccurate description of core aspects of Christianity and descriptions of European art, history, and architecture. The book has received mostly negative reviews from Catholic and other Christian communities. Many critics took issue with the level of research Brown did when writing the story. The New York Times writer Laura Miller characterized the novel as \\"based on a notorious hoax\\", \\"rank nonsense\\", and \\"bogus\\", saying the book is heavily based on the fabrications of Pierre Plantard, who is asserted to have created the Priory of Sion in 1956. Critics accuse Brown of distorting and fabricating history. For example, Marcia Ford wrote: Richard Abanes wrote: The book opens with the claim by Dan Brown that \\"The Priory of Sion—a French secret society founded in 1099—is a real organization\\". This assertion is broadly disputed; the Priory of Sion is generally regarded as a hoax created in 1956 by Pierre Plantard. The author also claims that \\"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents… and secret rituals in this novel are accurate\\", but this claim is disputed by numerous academic scholars expert in numerous areas. Dan Brown himself addresses the idea of some of the more controversial aspects being fact on his web site, stating that the \\"FACT\\" page at the beginning of the novel mentions only \\"documents, rituals, organization, artwork and architecture\\", but not any of the ancient theories discussed by fictional characters, stating that \\"Interpreting those ideas is left to the reader\\". Brown also says, \\"It is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit\\" and \\"the secret behind The Da Vinci Code was too well documented and significant for me to dismiss.\\" In 2003, while promoting the novel, Brown was asked in interviews what parts of the history in his novel actually happened. He replied \\"Absolutely all of it.\\" In a 2003 interview with CNN's Martin Savidge he was again asked how much of the historical background was true. He replied, \\"99% is true… the background is all true\\". Asked by Elizabeth Vargas in an ABC News special if the book would have been different if he had written it as non-fiction he replied, \\"I don't think it would have.\\" In 2005, UK TV personality Tony Robinson edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln, who authored the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, in the program The Real Da Vinci Code, shown on British TV Channel 4. The program featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists cited by Brown as \\"absolute fact\\" in The Da Vinci Code. Arnaud de Sède, son of Gérard de Sède, stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of the Prieuré de Sion, the cornerstone of the Jesus bloodline theory: \\"frankly, it was piffle\\", noting that the concept of a descendant of Jesus was also an element of the 1999 Kevin Smith film Dogma. The earliest appearance of this theory is due to the 13th-century Cistercian monk and chronicler Peter of Vaux de Cernay who reported that Cathars believed that the 'evil' and 'earthly' Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as his concubine (and that the 'good Christ' was incorporeal and existed spiritually in the body of Paul). The program The Real Da Vinci Code also cast doubt on the Rosslyn Chapel association with the Grail and on other related stories, such as the alleged landing of Mary Magdalene in France. According to The Da Vinci Code, the Roman Emperor Constantine I suppressed Gnosticism because it portrayed Jesus as purely human. The novel's argument is as follows:. Constantine wanted Christianity to act as a unifying religion for the Roman Empire. He thought Christianity would appeal to pagans only if it featured a demigod similar to pagan heroes. According to the Gnostic Gospels, Jesus was merely a human prophet, not a demigod. Therefore, to change Jesus' image, Constantine destroyed the Gnostic Gospels and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which portray Jesus as divine or semi-divine. But Gnosticism did not portray Jesus as merely human.. All Gnostic writings depict Christ as purely divine, his human body being a mere illusion (see Docetism). Gnostic sects saw Christ this way because they regarded matter as evil, and therefore believed that a divine spirit would never have taken on a material body. =Literary criticism= The book received both positive and negative reviews from critics, and it has been the subject of negative appraisals concerning its portrayal of history.

While interviewing Umberto Eco in a 2008 issue of The Paris Review, Lila Azam Zanganeh characterized The Da Vinci Code as \\"a bizarre little offshoot\\" of Eco's novel, Foucault's Pendulum. In response, Eco remarked, \\"Dan Brown is a character from Foucault's Pendulum! I invented him. He shares my characters' fascinations—the world conspiracy of Rosicrucians, Masons, and Jesuits. The role of the Knights Templar. The hermetic secret. The principle that everything is connected.

The book appeared on a 2010 list of 101 best books ever written, which was derived from a survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers.. Salman Rushdie said during a lecture, \\"Do not start me on The Da Vinci Code. A novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name.\\" Stephen Fry has referred to Brown's writings as \\"complete loose stool-water\\" and \\"arse gravy of the worst kind\\".. In a live chat on June 14, 2006, he clarified, \\"I just loathe all those book[s] about the Holy Grail and Masons and Catholic conspiracies and all that botty-dribble. I mean, there's so much more that's interesting and exciting in art and in history. It plays to the worst and laziest in humanity, the desire to think the worst of the past and the desire to feel superior to it in some fatuous way.\\" Stephen King likened Dan Brown's work to \\"Jokes for the John\\", calling such literature the \\"intellectual equivalent of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese\\". The New York Times, while reviewing the movie based on the book, called the book \\"Dan Brown's best-selling primer on how not to write an English sentence\\". The New Yorker reviewer Anthony Lane refers to it as \\"unmitigated junk\\" and decries \\"the crumbling coarseness of the style\\". Linguist Geoffrey Pullum and others posted several entries critical of Dan Brown's writing, at Language Log, calling Brown one of the \\"worst prose stylists in the history of literature\\" and saying Brown's \\"writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad\\". (also follow other links at the bottom of that page) Roger Ebert described it as a \\"potboiler written with little grace and style\\", although he said it did \\"supply an intriguing plot\\". In his review of the film National Treasure, whose plot also involves ancient conspiracies and treasure hunts, he wrote: \\"I should read a potboiler like The Da Vinci Code every once in a while, just to remind myself that life is too short to read books like The Da Vinci Code.\\" =Lawsuits= Author Lewis Perdue alleged that Brown plagiarized from two of his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy, originally published in 1983, and Daughter of God, originally published in 2000. He sought to block distribution of the book and film. However, Judge George Daniels of the US District Court in New York ruled against Perdue in 2005, saying that \\"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God\\" and that \\"Any slightly similar elements are on the level of generalized or otherwise unprotectable ideas.\\"\\"Author Brown 'did not plagiarise'\\" , BBC News, August 6, 2005 Perdue appealed, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original decision, saying Mr. Perdue's arguments were \\"without merit\\".\\"Delays to latest Dan Brown novel\\" , BBC News, April 21, 2006 In early 2006, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh filed suit against Brown's publishers, Random House. They alleged that significant portions of The Da Vinci Code were plagiarized from The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, violating their copyright. Brown confirmed during the court case that he named the principal Grail expert of his story Leigh Teabing, an anagram of \\"Baigent Leigh\\", after the two plaintiffs. In reply to the suggestion that Henry Lincoln was also referred to in the book, since he has medical problems resulting in a severe limp, like the character of Leigh Teabing, Brown stated he was unaware of Lincoln's illness and the correspondence was a coincidence. Since Baigent and Leigh had presented their conclusions as historical research, not as fiction, Mr Justice Peter Smith, who presided over the trial, deemed that a novelist must be free to use these ideas in a fictional context, and ruled against Baigent and Leigh. Smith also hid his own secret code in his written judgement, in the form of seemingly random italicized letters in the 71-page document, which apparently spell out a message. Smith indicated he would confirm the code if someone broke it. After losing before the High Court on July 12, 2006, they then appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Court of Appeal. In April 2006 Mikhail Anikin, a Russian scientist and art historian working as a senior researcher at the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, stated the intention to bring a lawsuit against Dan Brown, maintaining that he was the one who coined the phrase used as the book's title and one of the ideas regarding the Mona Lisa used in its plot. Anikin interprets the Mona Lisa to be a Christian allegory consisting of two images, one of Jesus Christ that comprises the image's right half, one of the Virgin Mary that forms its left half. According to Anikin, he expressed this idea to a group of experts from the Museum of Houston during a 1988 René Magritte exhibit at the Hermitage, and when one of the Americans requested permission to pass it along to a friend Anikin granted the request on condition that he be credited in any book using his interpretation. Anikin eventually compiled his research into Leonardo da Vinci or Theology on Canvas, a book published in 2000, but The Da Vinci Code, published three years later, makes no mention of Anikin and instead asserts that the idea in question is a \\"well-known opinion of a number of scientists.\\"Page, Jeremy. \\"Now Russian sues Brown over his Da Vinski Code\\", The Sunday Times, April 12, 2006.

During its opening weekend, moviegoers spent an estimated $77 million in America, and $224 million worldwide. The movie received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert in its review wrote that \\"Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones.\\" \\"it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.\\" The film received two sequels: Angels & Demons, released in 2009, and Inferno, released in 2016.

It was situated in Russell Street in London, at the northwest corner of Bow Street, between the City and Westminster. According to the Methuen Drama Dictionary of the Theatre, it was also known as the Rose Tavern, the Russell Street Coffee House, and the Wits' Coffee House. It was founded by Will Unwin. Patrons Will's Coffee House was the home of the Wits,A Ellis, The Penny Universities: A history of the coffee-houses, 1956; Steve Pincus, \\"'Coffee Politicians Does Create': Coffeehouses and Restoration Political Culture\\" The Journal of Modern History, 67 (December 1995:807-34); Brian Cowan, The Social Life of Coffee: the emergence of the British coffeehouse, 2005; centring on the figure of John Dryden.'Bow Street and Russell Street Area: Bow Street', Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden (1970), pp. 185-192. Date accessed: 8 July 2009; this gives the history of the site. With the departure of John Dennis, William Wycherley complained in a well-known letter, \\"nor is Wills the Wits Coffee-House any more, since you left it, whose Society for want of yours is grown as Melancholly, that is as dull as when you left 'em a Nights, to their own Mother-Wit, their Puns, Couplets, or Quibbles....\\"Wycherley to Dennis, Letter lxxix in A select Collection of Original Letters, written by the Most Eminent Persons...

And, had I time then, or > could at other times, it will be good coming thither, for there, I perceive, > is very witty and pleasant discourse\\". Jonathan Swift, for his part, did not recall it so positively: \\"And indeed the worst conversation I ever remember to have heard in my life was that at Will's coffee-house, where the wits (as they were called) used formerly to assemble.\\"Quoted in Raymond F. Howes, \\"Jonathan Swift and the conversation of the coffee-house\\", Quarterly Journal of Speech, 17.1 (February 1931:14-24). From their first appearance in London,Pasqua Rosée, a native of Ragusa, opened a coffee-house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, in 1652 coffeehouses were centers of sociability, each one frequented by certain professions, a centre of communication for news and information. At Will's gathered those gentlemen of no profession at all and circulated their scurrilous epigrams and satires, and criticized the latest productions on stage or in print. Decline After Dryden's death (May 1700), the reputation of Will's declined rapidly, though it is noted in Daniel Defoe's Journey Through England. Though in the first number of The Tatler, poetry was promised under the heading Will's Coffee- house,\\"All accounts of Gallantry, Pleasure, and Entertainment shall be under the Article of White's Chocolate-house; Poetry, under that of Will's Coffee- house; Learning, under the title of Graecian; Foreign and Domestick News, you will have from St. James' Coffee-house.\\" it was severely reviewed by Richard Steele in The Tatler, 8 April 1709, and fashion soon passed to Button's across the way, where Joseph Addison established Daniel Button in business, about 1712.William Harrison Ukers, All about Coffee, 1922:574-76.

He is known for his role as an anti-video-game activist, particularly against violence and sex in video games. During his time as an attorney, Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture. This included rap music, broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern, the content of video games and their alleged effects on children. He is also known for his unusual filings to The Florida Bar, including challenging the constitutionality of The Florida Bar itself in 1993. Later the Florida Supreme Court described his filings as \\"repetitive, frivolous and insulting to the integrity of the court\\". On March 20, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson, requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of The Florida Bar other than himself. In July 2008, Thompson was permanently disbarred by the Supreme Court of Florida for inappropriate conduct, including making false statements to tribunals and disparaging and humiliating litigants. Background Thompson grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, attended Cuyahoga Falls H.S. and attended Denison University. He received media attention when he hosted his own political talk show on the college radio station.Haring, Bruce. \\"The 'Private Sting' of Jack Thompson\\". Billboard, 1990-08-11 He then attended Vanderbilt University Law School, where he met his wife, Patricia. In 1976, they moved to Florida, where Thompson, working as a lawyer and then a fund-raiser for a Christian ministry, began attending the Key Biscayne Presbyterian Church and became a born-again Christian. Thompson admits to having a \\"colorful disciplinary history\\" as an attorney.Linn, Mike. \\"'Grand Theft Auto' comes under fire\\". Knight Ridder Tribune Business News, 2005-11-22. The Neil Rogers Show In 1988, Thompson became involved in a feud with WIOD Radio host Neil Rogers, after Thompson was instrumental in persuading the FCC to fine WIOD $10,000 for airing such parody songs as \\"Boys Want Sex in the Morning\\" on Rogers' show. Thompson also sued the station for violating a December 1987 agreement to end on-air harassment against him. For the next eight months, Thompson recorded all of Rogers' broadcasts and documented 40,000 mentionings of his name. Thompson claimed that one of the terms of his agreement with the station was that the station would pay him $5,000 each time his name was mentioned, totaling $200 million in the suit. Janet Reno Thompson first met Janet Reno in November 1975, when he applied for a job as an assistant state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers.Evans, Christine. \\"Challenger attacks Reno as too liberal\\". The Miami Herald, 1B, November 6, 1988. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded, \\"I'm only interested in virile men. That's why I'm not attracted to you.\\"Vick, Karl and David Dahl. \\"Stigma of a middle-aged, single woman\\". St. Petersburg Times, 1993-02-17. He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate.\\"Opponent accuses Reno of battery\\". The Miami Herald, 2D, September 9, 1988. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was \\"a political ploy\\". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a \\"kook\\". In 1990, after his election loss, Thompson began a campaign against the efforts of Switchboard of Miami, a social services group of which Reno was a board member. Thompson charged that the group placed \\"homosexual-education tapes\\" in public schools. Switchboard responded by getting the Supreme Court of Florida to order that he submit to a psychiatric examination. Thompson did so and passed. Thompson has since stated that he is \\"the only officially certified sane lawyer in the entire state of Florida\\".Timmerman, Kenneth R. \\"Reno Redux in Florida\\". Insight, October 5, 2001. Rap music Thompson came to national prominence in the controversy over 2 Live Crew's As Nasty As They Wanna Be album. (Luke Skyywalker Records, the company of 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell, had previously released a record supporting Reno in her race against Thompson.)Harrington, Richard. \\"On the Beat; In Md., the Sound and the Fury\\". The Washington Post, 1990-01-31. On January 1, 1990, he wrote to Martinez and Reno asking them to investigate whether the album violated Florida obscenity laws. Although the state prosecutor declined to proceed with an investigation, Thompson pushed local officials in various parts of the state to block sales of the album, along with N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton.Philips, Chuck. \\"2 Live Crew's 'Nasty Lyrics' a Bum Rap? \\" Los Angeles Times, March 7, 1990. In sending documents to opponents, Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver's license, with a photo of Batman pasted over his own. Thompson said, \\"I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I'm playing the role of Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie, I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County.\\" He also wore a Batman wristwatch.Parker, Laura. \\"Sheriff's Crackdown on Rap Puts Unlikely County in Spotlight\\". The Washington Post, 1990-06-17. Thompson compared Campbell to the Joker.Kohn, Marek. \\"Very nasty indeed; Brutal and sexually explicit, the raps of 2 Live Crew have outraged US fundamentalists, but their ghetto origins have confused the liberal conscience\\". The Independent, 1990-09-16. Thompson also said, \\"I understand as well as anybody that the First Amendment is a cornerstone of a free society—but there is a responsibility to people who can be harmed by words and thoughts, one of which is the message from Campbell that women can be sexually abused.\\" Thompson also took issue with another 2 Live Crew song, \\"Banned in the U.S.A.\\". He sent a letter to Jon Landau, manager of Bruce Springsteen, whose song \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was to be sampled by the group. Thompson suggested that Landau \\"protect 'Born in the U.S.A.' from its apparent theft by a bunch of clowns who traffic toxic waste to kids,\\" or else Thompson would \\"be telling the nation about Mr. Springsteen's tacit approval\\" of the song, which, according to Campbell, \\"expresses anger about the failure of the First Amendment to protect 2 Live Crew from prosecution\\".Harrington, Richard. \\"Banned in the U.S.A.' Released as Rap Group Faces 'Nasty' Charges \\". The Washington Post, July 4, 1990. Thompson also said, \\"the 'social commentary' on this album is akin to a sociopath's discharging his AK-47 into a crowded schoolyard, with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee-wee Herman's views on politics\\".Harrington, Richard. \\"The Crew: Courage or Crime? \\" The Washington Post, August 1, 1990. The members of 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal district court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album could result in a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.Luke Records Inc. v. Navarro, 960 F.2d 134 (11th Cir. 1992). As the debate continued, Thompson wrote, \\"An industry that says a line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered.\\"Thompson, Jack. \\"Clean Up Record Lyrics—Or Else\\".

Bob Guccione, Jr., founder of Spin magazine, responded by calling Thompson \\"a sort of latter-day Don Quixote, as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was,\\" and argued that his campaign was achieving \\"two things...: pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity\\".Guccione, Bob Jr. \\"Nothing Should Be Legally Obscene\\".

Billboard, 1991-01-12. Thompson wrote another letter in 1991, this time to the Minnesota attorney general Skip Humphrey, complaining about the N.W.A album Niggaz4Life. Humphrey warned locally-based Musicland that sales of the album might violate state law against distribution of sexually explicit material harmful to minors. Humphrey also referred the matter to the Minneapolis city attorney, who concluded that some of the songs might fit the legal definition if issued as singles, but that sales of the album as a whole were not prosecutable.Harrington, Richard. \\"Brewer’s Ads Rapped \\".

Later, Thompson would criticize the Republican Party for inviting N.W.A member and party donor Eric \\"Eazy-E\\" Wright to an exclusive function.Philips, Chuck. \\"Rodney King Gets Rap Offer \\". Los Angeles Times, 1991-03-20. In 1992, Thompson was hired by the Freedom Alliance, a self-described patriot group founded by Oliver North, described as \\"far-right\\" by The Washington Post. By this time, Thompson was looking to have Time Warner, then being criticized for promoting the Ice-T song \\"Cop Killer\\", prosecuted for federal and state crimes such as sedition, incitement to riot, and \\"advocating overthrow of government\\" by distributing material that, in Thompson's view, advocated the killing of police officers.Harrington, Richard. \\"Time Warner in the Line of Fire \\". Washington Post, July 8, 1992. Time Warner eventually released Ice-T and his band from their contract, and voluntarily suspended distribution of the album on which \\"Cop Killer\\" was featured. Thompson's push to label various musical performances obscene was not entirely limited to rap. In addition to taking on 2 Live Crew, Thompson campaigned against sales of the racy music video for Madonna's \\"Justify My Love\\".Philips, Chuck. \\"Anger Over Madonna Single \\". Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1991. Then in 1996, he took on MTV broadcasts for \\"objectification of women\\" by writing to the station's corporate parent, Viacom, demanding a stop to what he called \\"corporate pollution\\".Sandler, Adam. \\"CLEAN UP MY MTV?\\" Daily Variety, 1996-12-24. He also went after MTV's advertisers and urged the United States Army to pull recruiting commercials, citing the Army's recruitment of women and problems with sexual harassment scandals.Sandler, Adam. \\"Activist demands MTV pull Army ads\\". Daily Variety, 1997-02-19. Video games Jack Thompson worries children may develop violent tendencies due to video games. Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as \\"murder simulators\\" to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres. According to Thompson, \\"In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers.\\"\\"Excerpt from '20/20' on the Debate Whether Violent Video Games Desensitize Children\\". World News Now, ABC, 2000-03-23. Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior.Thompson, Jack. \\"Violent video games feed unhealthy ideas to young kids\\". Tacoma News Tribune, January 8, 2006.The idea of a causal link between video games and violence has been challenged. For example, According to Thompson, \\"If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, one has to wonder why he doesn't get a life, but when it comes to kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain.\\"Drew, James. \\"Ohio sniper case may put video games on trial \\". Toledo Blade, 2004-11-21. Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as \\"Pearl Harbor 2\\".Lasker, John. \\"MURDER SIMULATORS? Railing against video game violence isn't just for Jack Thompson anymore \\". Dayton City Paper, January 4, 2006. According to Thompson, \\"Many parents think that stores won't sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked.\\"Cooper, Anderson. Anderson Cooper 360. CNN, October 8, 2005. Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression, saying, \\"Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech. They're not even speech. They're dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it,\\" as well as simply calling video games \\"mental masturbation\\". In addition, he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military, saying that it was looking \\"for a way to disconnect in the soldier's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end\\".Thompson, Jack. \\"Bloodlust video games put kids in the crosshairs\\". Denver Post, 1999-05-30. Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies, such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies, which, he suggests, were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers' inhibition to kill.Worthy, Kym. \\"Why violent video games may be worse than other media violence\\". Michigan Chronicle, October 5, 2005. He also claims that the PlayStation 2's DualShock controller \\"gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill. This is operant conditioning, behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner's laboratory.\\"Thompson, Jack. . Shreveport Times, 2006-05-24. Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles, Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004. This was an aggravated murder case against 29-year-old Charles McCoy, Jr., the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus, Ohio. When McCoy was captured, a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room. Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy's lawyers, Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy's residence. This showed, among other things, the discovery of additional games State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Dead to Rights. However, he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy, whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia. In Thompson's estimation, McCoy was the \\"functional equivalent of a 15-year-old,\\" and \\"the only thing insane about this case is the (insanity) defense\\".\\"Nancy Grace for April 21, 2005, CNNHN\\". Nancy Grace, CNN, 2005-04-21. =Early litigation= Thompson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of three students killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997. Investigations showed that the perpetrator, 14-year-old Michael Carneal, had regularly played various computer games (including Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Redneck Rampage, Nightmare Creatures, MechWarrior, and Resident Evil) and accessed some pornographic websites. Carneal had also owned a videotape of The Basketball Diaries, which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included product liability for making \\"defective\\" products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors.James v. Meow Media, 90 F. Supp. 2d 798 (W.D. Ky. 2000). Said Thompson, \\"We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites.\\"Prichard, James. \\"Parents of slain students sue entertainment industry companies\\". The Associated Press State & Local Wire, 1999-04-12. The suit was filed in federal district court and was dismissed for failing to present a legally recognizable claim. The court concluded that Carneal's actions were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants and that, in any case, his actions superseded those of the defendants, so the latter could not therefore be the proximate cause of the harm. In addition, the judge determined that \\"thoughts, ideas and images\\" in the defendants' materials did not constitute \\"products\\" that could be considered defective. The ruling was upheld on appeal.James v. Meow Media, 300 F.3d 683 (6th Cir. 2002) =Grand Theft Auto= Actions in law =Ohio= In February 2003, Thompson asked permission to file an amicus curiae (or \\"friend of the court\\") brief in the Ohio case of Dustin Lynch, 16, who was charged with aggravated murder in the death of JoLynn Mishne; Lynch was \\"obsessed\\" with Grand Theft Auto III.Hudak, Stephen. \\"Should video game share blame? Father of slain Medina girl says manufacturer is accomplice\\". The Plain Dealer, 2003-02-21. When Judge John Lohn ruled that Lynch would be tried as an adult, Thompson passed a message from Mishne's father to the judge, asserting that \\"the attorneys had better tell the jury about the violent video game that trained this kid [and] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn. If they don't, I will.\\"Hudak, Stephen. \\"State gets; OK to try teenager as adult 16-year-old accused of killing Medina girl\\". The Plain Dealer, 2003-05-13. In a motion sent to the prosecutor, the boy's court-appointed lawyer, and reporters, Thompson asked to be recognized as the boy's lawyer in the case. Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman, however, said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne's parents.Hudak, Stephen. \\"Lawyer's motive in teen murder trial debated\\". The Plain Dealer, June 7, 2003. Claiming that delays had weakened his case, Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson's request for two months.Hudak, Stephen. \\"Lawyer wants in, wants judge out in murder case of Medina teen\\". The Plain Dealer, 2003-08-19. The boy himself eventually rejected Thompson's offer, withdrawing his insanity plea. Lynch's mother, Jerrilyn Thomas, who had demanded that Collier appoint Thompson to defend her son, said she changed her mind after visiting with her son in jail, saying that the charge against him \\"has nothing to do with video games or Paxil, and my son's no murderer.\\"Hudak, Stephen. \\"Teen can stand trial in girl's murder; Father of slain Medina High pupil upset that video game critic won't be in court\\". The Plain Dealer, 2003-09-16. =Tennessee= Thompson returned to file a lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 on behalf of the victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault.Hamel, et al. v. Sony Computer Ent., et al., No. 28,613-III (Cocke County Cir. Court of Tenn. 2003). Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew or should have known that the game would cause copycat violence.Yi, Matthew. \\"Gamemaker sued over highway shootings \\". San Francisco Chronicle, 2003-10-23. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.Hamel, et al. v. Sony Computer Ent., et al., No. 2:03cv00375 (E.D. Tenn. October 24, 2003). =Alabama= Thompson was involved in a similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore, a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player. The lawyer's participation in the case, however, ran into a dispute over his pro hac vice, or temporary, admission to practice in that state. The opposing attorneys sought removal of the privilege by arguing that Thompson's conduct was unethical and claiming that he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails.DeWitt, Robert. \\"Attorney in Fayette case bows out \\". Tuscaloosa News, November 8, 2005. The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore's criminal trial. Thompson tried to withdraw from the case, but his request was denied by the judge, who went ahead and revoked Thompson's temporary admission to the state bar. For his part, Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore's criminal conviction at any cost.DeWitt, Robert. \\"Judge denies attorney's request to withdraw from Devin Moore case\\". Tuscaloosa News, 2005-11-19. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team,DeWitt, Robert. \\"Judge stands by Fayette decision\\". Tuscaloosa News, 2005-11-22. and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.Station 7 WVU. Birmingham, Alabama. Noon News, November 3, 2005. In the aftermath of this lawsuit, Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell \\"cop-killing games\\". After the slaying of another police officer in Gassville, Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida, an 18-year-old fugitive, Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to Grand Theft Auto, but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved.Rotermund, Maggie. \\"Investigators: Video games not linked to shooting\\". The Baxter Bulletin, February 8, 2006. =Florida= Thompson once reported that he had videotaped a Miami Best Buy employee selling a copy of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City to his son who was 10 at the time. In a letter to Best Buy, he wrote, \\"Prosecutions and public relations consequences should fall on your Minneapolis headquarters like snowflakes.\\"Morris, Chris. \\"Crackpot or crusader? \\" CNN/Money, 2003-01-31. He eventually sued the company in Florida, arguing that it had violated a law against sale of sexual materials deemed harmful to minors. In January 2005, Best Buy agreed that it would enforce an existing policy to check the identification of anyone who appeared to be 17 or under and tried to purchase games rated \\"M\\" (for mature audiences). No law in effect at the time prohibited selling \\"M\\" rated video games to juveniles. =New Mexico= In September 2006, Thompson and attorney Steven Sanders filed a suit in Albuquerque, New Mexico, against Sony, Take-Two, Rockstar Games, and teenage killer Cody Posey, for the wrongful death of three members of Posey's family. The suit, on behalf of surviving family members, claimed that \\"obsessively\\" playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City made violence \\"pleasurable and attractive,\\" disconnected violence from consequences, and caused Posey to \\"act out, copycat, replicate and emulate the violence\\" when in July 2004 he shot and killed his father, stepmother, and stepsister and then buried them under a manure pile. According to Thompson, \\"Posey essentially practiced how to kill on this game. If it wasn't for Grand Theft Auto, three people might not now be dead.\\"Gutierrez Krueger, Joline. \\"Video-game maker blamed in '04 killing \\". The Albuquerque Tribune, 2006-09-25. The suit claimed that Thompson had been told by a sheriff's deputy that the game and a Sony PlayStation 2 were found at the ranch. The suit also claimed that the game taught Posey \\"how to point and shoot a gun in a fashion making him an extraordinarily effective killer without teaching him any of the constraints or responsibilities needed to inhibit such a killing capacity.\\"\\"Lawsuit blames 'Grand Theft Auto' video game for teen shooting family at N.M. ranch\\". The Associated Press State & Local Wire, 2006-09-26. Gary Mitchell, Posey's attorney, said Thompson contacted him \\"numerous times\\" before the trial, urging him to highlight the game in Posey's defense, but Mitchell said he \\"just didn't find it had any merit whatsoever.\\"Romo, Rene. \\"Relatives of Posey's Victims Say Video Game Helped Turn Teenager Into a Killer \\". Albuquerque Journal, 2006-09-26. Take-Two reaction On March 14, 2007, Take-Two filed a lawsuit seeking to permanently enjoin Thompson from filing any public nuisance action against the company that would block the sales to minors of the unreleased video games Grand Theft Auto IV and Manhunt 2. The suit alleged that Thompson's lawsuits violated the company's First Amendment rights.Ganapati, Priya. \\"Take-Two Goes After Chief Critic \\". TheStreet.com, 2007-03-16. Responding, Thompson said: \\"I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid, so arrogant, so dumb, even dumber than what they have to date done, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.\\"Kesten, Lou. \\"'God of War II' takes over PlayStation 2\\". BusinessWeek, 2007-03-21. On April 19, 2007, Thompson and Take-Two settled the suit, with Thompson agreeing not to seek any legal restriction on sales of Take-Two's games, threaten to sue the company, or accuse Take-Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games. One analyst said that the settlement was likely to mute his public pronouncements and lawsuits against the company.Ganapati, Priya. \\"Take-Two Settles With Critic \\". TheStreet.com, 2007-09-19. However, upon the game's 2008 release, Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV \\"the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio,\\" and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to \\"pursue and file criminal charges against [Minnesota-based retailers] Target and Best Buy\\".Ojeda-Zapata, Julio. \\"'GTA IV' releases mayhem — and parental anxiety \\". St. Paul Pioneer Press 2008-04-28. He also sent a letter to Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick's attorney, addressed to Zelnick's mother, in which Thompson accused her son of \\"doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA: IV to teen boys in the United States, a country in which your son claims you raised him to be a 'a Boy Scout'. ... More like the Hitler Youth, I would say.\\"Hawke, Jack. \\"Grand Theft Auto IV cracks $500m mark \\". Ninemsn 2008-05-08. On May 1, 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck, asserting that the game's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal, and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought.Glenn Beck. CNN Headline News, 2008-05-01. Thompson also filed a complaint with the Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago, Illinois bus stops.Dawkins, Tao. \\"Local gamers celebrate premiere\\". Palladium-Item 2008-05-04. GameZone emails In September 2013, Thompson expressed his hatred of Grand Theft Auto V during a series of e-mails exchange with GameZone writer Lance Liebl during its launch week. The game happened to launch the day after the Washington Navy Yard shooting. Traditional media outlets such as FOX News sought out to find proof that violent video games, such as Grand Theft Auto V, had a role in the brutal killings. GameZone responded by writing an article that disagrees with this. These caught Thompson's attention, who then sent an e-mail to the site. \\"Look, Lance,\\" he wrote in an email, \\"The American Psychological Association has established a causal link between these games and increased aggression. The Dept. of Defense uses them for that purpose.\\" Liebl responded by offering Thompson a chance to come on the site and explain his stance, which he refused, describing gamers as \\"too brain-impaired to get it.\\" =Bully= Beginning in 2005, Thompson supported a campaign to discourage Take-Two's subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, \\"what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully.\\"Dobbs, Lou. Lou Dobbs Tonight. CNN, 2005-08-24. According to Thompson, the game \\"shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts.\\" Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game's release.Hoag, Christina. \\"Activist bullies video game sellers.\\" Knight Ridder Tribune Business News, 2005-08-18. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization.Moult, Julie. \\"Slam at Vid Jerks\\". New York Post, August 3, 2005. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game.Pinzur, Matthew I. . Miami Herald, 2006-03-13. In March 2006, the Miami-Dade County Public Schools board unanimously passed a resolution criticizing the game and urging retailers not to sell the game to minors. Thompson also criticized Bill Gates and Microsoft for contracting with Rockstar Games to release the game on the Xbox. The Xbox version has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami if he did not gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, \\"the horse will be out of the barn and it will be too late to do anything about it\\". Thompson argued that it violated Florida's public nuisance laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.Jones, K.C., TechWeb Technology News, 2006-08-14 Rockstar Games co-founder Terry Donovan responded, saying \\"I would prefer it if we could simply make great games and not have to deal with misunderstanding and misperception of what we do.\\"Kesten, Lou. \\"The week in video-game news\\", Associated Press, August 16, 2006 After receiving no response from Rockstar regarding an advance copy, Thompson filed the public nuisance complaint against Wal-Mart, Take-Two Interactive, and GameStop, demanding that he be allowed to preview the game before its October 17 release date. Take-Two offered to bring in a copy and let both Judge Ronald Friedman and Thompson view the game in the judge's chambers on October 12, 2006.Slagle, Matt. \\"BullyLawsuit,00.html Judge to Weigh in on 'Bully' Video Game \\". Associated Press, 2006-10-12. The judge ultimately saw no reason to restrict sales and dismissed the complaint the next day.Slagle, Matt. \\"New Game Renews Criticism of Violence \\". Associated Press, 2006-10-13. Thompson was critical of the judge's decision, telling the judge \\"You did not see the game... You don't even know what it was you saw,\\" as well as accusing the Take-Two employee who demonstrated the game of avoiding the most violent parts.Carey, Bridget. Blank Rome subsequently filed a motion to have Thompson's behavior declared \\"contempt for the court\\". Judge Friedman then recused himself from ruling, and instead filed a complaint against Thompson with The Florida Bar, calling Thompson's behavior \\"inappropriate by a member of the bar, unprofessional and contemptible\\". Thompson later drew attention to the game's main character, a 15-year-old male, being able to kiss other boys. Thompson wrote to ESRB president Patricia Vance, \\"We just found gay sexual content in Bully as Jimmy Hopkins makes out with another male student. Good luck with your Teen rating now.\\" The ESRB responded by saying they were already aware that the content was in the game when they rated it.\\"Game roundup: Wait for 'Burning Crusade'; 'Mansfield' a 96-hour keeper \\". USA Today, 2006-11-03. =Manhunt= During the aftermath of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah, by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England, the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police found a copy in Leblanc's room. The police officially denied any link, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's bedroom, not Leblanc's. Thompson, who had heard of the murder, claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings: \\"I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is not an isolated incident. These types of games are basically murder simulators. There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis.\\" Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £50 million in a wrongful death claim. Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game during the release of the sequel Manhunt 2. Thompson said he planned to sue Take-Two/Rockstar in an effort to have both Manhunt 2 and Grand Theft Auto IV banned as \\"public nuisances\\", saying \\"killings have been specifically linked to Take-Two's Manhunt and Grand Theft Auto games. [I have] asked Take-Two and retailers to stop selling Take-Two's 'Mature' murder simulation games to kids. They all refuse. They are about to be told by a court of law that they must adhere to the logic of their own 'Mature' labels.\\" The suits were eradicated when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL to block the impending lawsuit, on the grounds that video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website \\"I have been praying, literally, that Take- Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two. The pit Take-Two has dug for itself will be patently clear next week when I strike back.\\" =Mortal Kombat= In October 2006, Thompson sent a letter to Midway Games, demanding they cease and desist selling the latest game in the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, claiming that the game was illegally profiting on his likeness, because gamers could use the character creation option to make a character who looked like Thompson. Midway did not respond to his letter. =Activism and lobbying= Jack Thompson and Eugene F. Provenzo believe that first person shooter games provide children with \\"efficient killing skills\\". In addition to filing lawsuits, Thompson has pushed for measures against similar games in a variety of public settings. He wrote a joint article in the Christian Science Monitor with Eugene F. Provenzo, a University of Miami professor who studies the effects of video games on children. Originally brought together to provide opposing viewpoints on 60 Minutes in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, they said they had become friends and were collaborating on a book. They described themselves as having \\"a shared belief that first-person shooter video games are bad for our children, teaching them to act aggressively and providing them with efficient killing skills and romanticized and trivialized scenarios for killing in the real world\\".Provenzo, Eugene F., Jr. and Jack Thompson. \\"A political odd couple's advice on finding common ground .\\" Christian Science Monitor, 2004-10-19. Thompson has supported legislation in a number of states that would ban sales of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors. In response to First Amendment concerns, he argued that the games were a \\"public safety hazard.\\"Snyder, David. \\"Md. House Panel Hesitant on Video Game Restrictions \\". Washington Post, March 9, 2005. However, he rejected as \\"completely unconstitutional\\" Hillary Clinton's proposed legislation to ban sales to minors of games rated \\"M\\" for Mature by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Thompson contended that the government could not enforce a private-sector standard but had to depend on a Miller obscenity test. He charged that Clinton was simply positioning herself politically, with the support of the gaming industry, by proposing a bill which he felt she knew would be unconstitutional.Thompson, Jack. \\"What kind of game is Hillary Clinton playing?\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 2005-12-11. In July 2005, Thompson sent a letter to several politicians urging them to investigate The Sims 2, alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes. Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated \\"T\\" for Teen, a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older. Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations, with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have \\"no anatomical detail\\" under their clothes, effectively resembling Barbie dolls. Although the game does display blurred-out patches over body regions when characters are naked, such as when taking a shower, Brown said that was for \\"humorous effect\\" and denied there was anything improper about the game.Wingfield, Nick. \\"Guess What's Hiding in Your Videogame .\\" The Wall Street Journal, 2005-07-26. Nevertheless, a command that could be entered into the in-game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion. No official reason was given for the change. In Louisiana, Thompson helped draft a 2006 bill sponsored by state representative Roy Burrell to ban the sale of violent video games to buyers under 18 (HB1381). In an effort to avoid constitutional problems, it avoided trying to define \\"violent\\" and instead adopted a variation of the Miller obscenity test: sales to minors would be illegal based on community standards if the game appealed to \\"the minor's morbid interest in violence\\", was patently offensive based on adult standards of suitability for minors, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. The bill was passed unanimously by the state House and approved by the Senate Judiciary A Committee, despite industry opposition and predictions that it too would be unconstitutional.Hasten, Mike. . Shreveport Times, May 5, 2006. The Shreveport Times editorialized that Thompson's support of the bill \\"should immediately set off alarms\\" and described Thompson as someone who \\"thrives on chasing cultural ambulances\\".. Shreveport Times, May 16, 2006. In defense of the bill, Thompson said that it was needed for public safety, and that it was a \\"miracle\\" that a Columbine- type event hadn't happened yet in Louisiana.Thompson, John Bruce. \\"La. needs video game sales restrictions \\". WBRZ News 2, June 8, 2006. However, the ESA filed suit under Entertainment Software Association v. Foti, and U.S. District Judge James Brady issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the law from taking effect until full judicial review can be done.\\"La. Ban of Some Video Games Blocked .\\" Wilmington Star, August 25, 2006. The law was permanently enjoined in late November 2006, and the state was ordered to pay the legal fees of the plaintiffs. Judge Brady was \\"dumbfounded\\" that state legislators and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco wasted taxpayer money by trying to enact the law.. KATC3, April 16, 2007. At one point, Thompson was asked by the National Institute on Media and the Family to stop invoking the organization's name in his campaigns. NIMF president David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name. \\"Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect,\\" Walsh said in an open letter to Thompson.Tilley, Steve. \\"Spielberg Grabs the Controller.\\" Toronto Sun, 2005-10-23. Thompson has additionally worked to influence police investigations concerning violent acts which he views as being connected to violence in video games media. On June 2, 2006, Thompson suggested that West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana police detectives, investigating the murder of 55-year-old Michael Gore by 17-year-old Kurt Edward Neher, should look into the video games played by Neher. According to Sheriff J. Austin Daniel, an autopsy showed Gore was beaten to death as well as shot in the face. Concerning this, Thompson stated that \\"nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you're a hit man or a video gamer.\\" =Other public commentary= Thompson predicted that the perpetrator of the Beltway sniper attacks would be \\"a teenaged boy, who plays video games\\" and speculated incorrectly that he \\"may indeed ride a bicycle to and from his shooting locations, his gun broken down and placed in a backpack while he pedals.\\"Milloy, Courtland. \\"The Need to Put a Face on This Killer\\". Washington Post, 2002-10-23. Saying that the shooter, Lee Boyd Malvo, had \\"trained\\" on Halo, Thompson later claimed credit for this on The Today Show: \\"I predicted that the beltway sniper would be a teen-aged boy that trained on a game switched to sniper mode. And three months later, NBC reported that that's exactly what Malvo did. And Muhammed had him train on the game to suppress his inhibition to kill.\\"\\"Attorney Jack Thompson and Michael Miller, PC magazine, discuss war video games and their impact.\\" Today, 2003-04-17.Gibson, John. \\"Interview with Jack Thompson\\".

Thompson has also criticized a Christian video game based on the Left Behind series. In Left Behind: Eternal Forces, players participate in \\"battles raging in the streets of New York,\\" according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in \\"physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world.\\" Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values.Rhodes, Hillary. \\"Christian Game: Good Word or Bad Idea? \\" Sioux City Journal, 2006-04-11. He said, \\"Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass- killing game.\\"Chmielewski, Dawn C. Los Angeles Times, 2006-05-10. Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying \\"Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give them something that's positive.\\" The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has \\"personally broken my heart,\\" but claims, \\"I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States.\\"Levy, Piet. \\"'Left Behind' Video Game Draws Criticism for Apocalyptic Violence.\\" Religion News Service, June 8, 2006. In April 2007, only hours after the Virginia Tech shooting (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter- Strike.Benedetti, Winda. \\"Were video games to blame for massacre? \\" MSNBC.com, 2007-04-20 According to Thompson, the game \\"drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [and] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower.\\" He says that Seung-Hui \\"was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality.\\" Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four years prior to the shooting, Thompson asserts that \\"you don't drop it when you go to college, typically.\\" Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that \\"Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people.\\"Hardball, MSNBC, 2007-04-19 Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the \\"flat effect on [Seung-Hui's] face\\" and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting.MSNBC, 2007-04-16, 7:27 PM. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that \\"this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer.\\" Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, \\"Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that used to be in the Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill.\\" However, Microsoft did not create Counter- Strike – they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui \\"played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog,\\" and that \\"none of the video games [he had played] were war games or had violent themes.\\"Virginia Tech Incident Review Panel. Chapter IV: Mental Health History of Seung Hui Cho . In December 2007, Thompson filed suit against Omaha, Nebraska Police Chief Thomas Warren, asking him to produce information on all \\"violent entertainment material\\" belonging to Robert Hawkins, who killed nine people, including himself, in a shooting at the Westroads Mall earlier that month. According to Omaha police, such information is not a matter of public record, as it is part of an ongoing criminal investigation.\\"Lawyer Sues OPD Chief For Hawkins' Video-Game Records .\\" KETV-TV, 2007-12-28. On February 15, 2008, Jack Thompson claimed that the actions of Steven Kazmierczak, who the previous day killed five people at Northern Illinois University before committing suicide, were influenced by the game Counter-Strike.FOX News Channel, 2008-02-15. In a subsequent news release, Thompson claimed that \\"We have a nation of Manchurian Candidate video gamers out there who are ready, willing, and able to massacre, and some of them will.\\"Benedetti, Windi. \\"Playing the Blame Game \\".

MyFoxNational Reports, 2008-02-18. =Relationship with the gaming industry and gamers= Thompson's \\"high-profile crusades\\" have made him an enemy of video game aficionados. On occasion, Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans. In 2005, he wrote an open letter to Entertainment Software Association president Doug Lowenstein, making what he described as \\"a modest video game proposal\\" (an allusion to the title of Jonathan Swift's satirical essay, A Modest Proposal) to the video game industry: Thompson said he would donate $10,000 to a charity designated by Take-Two CEO Paul Eibeler if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter. The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of industry executives (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator, among others. Afterwards, he claimed that his proposal was satire, and refused to make the promised donation. Jerry Holkins (right) and Mike Krahulik (left) stepped in to donate $10,000 to charity in Thompson's stead. In response, Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, the creators of gaming webcomic Penny Arcade and of the children's charity Child's Play, stepped in to make the $10,000 donation instead, writing in the memo field of their cheque, \\"For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won't.\\" Afterwards, Thompson tried unsuccessfully to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating \\"criminal harassment\\" of him through articles on their site.Kohler, Chris. \\"Jack Thompson Versus Gamers .\\" Wired News, 2005-11-04. Other webcomics have regularly incorporated references to Thompson, alluding to this incident as well as others.For examples, see Ctrl+Alt+Del by Tim Buckley, \\"Bathing Suit Area\\" (2005-08-08) and \\"An Open Letter to Jack Thompson\\" (2005-10-12); GU Comics by Woody Hearn, August 16 and October 18, 2005 ; VG Cats by Scott Ramsoomair, \\"Coco Beans in Warm Water \\"; Bunny by Lem, \\"different reasons, same fun \\" (2005-10-17); Punks and Nerds by Josh Mirman, October 21, 2005 ; PvP by Scott Kurtz, parody of complaint on October 21st, 2005 news post ; Shortpacked! by David Willis, October 24, 2005 . In 2006, two Michigan gamers began a project dubbed \\"Flowers for Jack\\", soliciting donations to deliver a massive floral arrangement to Thompson's office. The flowers were delivered in February along with a letter aimed at opening a dialogue between Thompson and the video gaming community. Thompson rejected this overture and forwarded the flowers to some of his industry foes, with such comments as \\"Discard them along with the decency you discarded long ago. I really don't care. Grind them up and smoke them if you like.\\"Tilley, Steve. \\"New Windows Will Be Open to Halo 2.\\" Toronto Sun, 2006-02-12. Gamers have responded to Thompson's attempt to link the Virginia Tech massacre to the game Counter-Strike. Video game Web sites and young gamers on Internet message boards \\"teemed with anger\\" at what San Francisco Chronicle reporter Peter Hartlaub called \\"his serial misstatements,\\" in some cases linking to YouTube videos of Thompson and dissecting his claims point by point.Hartlaub, Peter. \\"Another tragedy, another platform for video game fearmonger \\". San Francisco Chronicle, 2007-04-24 Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, said, \\"It's so sad. These massacre chasers—they're worse than ambulance chasers—they're waiting for these things to happen so they can jump on their soapbox.\\" In response, Thompson referred to Della Rocca as an \\"idiot\\" and a \\"jackass [...] paid not to connect the dots [connecting shootings to video games],\\" and compared himself to people who warned that the government should be more concerned about terrorism before the September 11, 2001 attacks.MSNBC, 2007-04-21, 8:42 AM. According to Della Rocca, Thompson then challenged him to a series of gaming debates, claiming that they could each make more than $3,000 per event. When Della Rocca suggested that neither he nor Thompson accept any money for the events, Thompson refused. In July 2009, Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA) president Hal Halpin posted a copy of an email exchange between himself and Thompson, stating, \\"I get messages (IMs, emails, FB notes, etc.) from members all the time, asking what the (almost daily) notes are from JT. Since this one's fairly harmless and I've redacted anything personal (not that I don't love getting his threatening cease and desist letters), I thought I'd share it as a pretty typical exchange.\\" Halpin and Thompson have been vocal opponents since 1998, when Halpin ran the game retail trade association IEMA. The exchange was sparked by a guest editorial that Halpin entitled, \\"Perception is Everything\\" for IndustryGamers.com where he called for consumers and the industry to speak out against negative stereotyping of gamers. In March 2011, in response to the creation of a school shooter mod entitled School Shooter: North American Tour 2012, developed by Checkerboarded Studios on Valve's Source engine, Thompson emailed Valve's managing director, Gabe Newell, demanding that the mod be removed, as he speculated that Valve played a part in the mod's development. In the letter, Thompson stated that Half-Life was directly responsible for the Erfurt school massacre, as well as the Virginia Tech massacre and that Valve had until 5:00 PM on March 18 to remove the mod. The Howard Stern Show In 2004, Thompson helped get Howard Stern's show taken off a radio station in Orlando, Florida by filing a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. Thompson objected to Stern's use of perceived obscenities on the air. He argued that \\"Either broadcasters will accept the light harness of decency that has been the law for decades and start cleaning up their acts, or the public's deepening outrage will foster a more fearsome governmental response.\\"Thompson, Jack. \\"Why I Complain About Indecency.\\" Broadcasting & Cable, 2004-04-26. Thompson claimed to have received death threats from listeners of Stern's show, noting that \\"you'd expect that considering the IQ of people who listen to Howard Stern. Apparently they fail to realize that I might have caller ID.\\"Mayo, Michael. \\"Puritanical Intolerance is Scarier Than Stern Himself.\\" South Florida Sun-Sentinel, 2004-04-18. During his opposition to Howard Stern, Thompson was asked in an interview with a reporter if, by his standards, he would blame Christianity for the murders committed by Michael Hernandez, a fourteen-year-old who murdered one of his classmates in 2004, because Hernandez wrote a diary in which he constantly spoke about praying to God. Thompson replied, \\"The Bible doesn't promote killing innocent people, Grand Theft Auto does. Islam does.\\" Thompson then expanded his comments in the same interview by saying, \\"Islam promotes the killing of innocent people. The Quran requires the infidel, whether Jew or Christian, to be killed. ... That's a core essence of the religion. ... Muhammad was a pirate who killed infidels and who advocated the killing of infidels—not a nice guy. Osama bin Laden is in keeping with his fine tradition.\\" He later spoke in defense of Stern during the latter's legal dispute with CBS over promoting Sirius on-air before his switch to satellite radio. Thompson contended that the technology added by CBS to edit out profanity also could have worked to edit out Stern's references to Sirius.Arango, Tim. \\"Decency crusader backs up Howard .\\" New York Post, March 2, 2006. According to Thompson, \\"The reason why CBS chose not to edit Stern is that Stern's Arbitron ratings remained high and were arguably even enhanced by people tuning in to hear daily about Stern's running feud with CBS and his move to Sirius. In other words, CBS actually used Stern's discussion of his move to Sirius to make more money for CBS.\\"Rosenthal, Phil. \\"The Chicago Tribune Phil Rosenthal Media column.\\" Knight Ridder Tribune Business News, March 3, 2006. CBS President Leslie Moonves responded, saying \\"You know what? You can't let people like that tell you what to put on the air or what not to put on the air. That would only open the door when suddenly next week, he says, 'Take David Letterman off the air or take C.S.I. off the air.' Or you know what? Everybody Loves Raymond was about, you know, sex last week or about a 70-year-old man—you know, we dealt with Peter Boyle having sex with Doris Roberts. 'Take that off the air.' That's something we can't let happen.\\"Brown, Tina. \\"Leslie Moonves discusses his work at Viacom and CBS.\\" Topic A with Tina Brown CNBC, 2004-11-21. The Florida Bar =Actions against the bar= In 1993, Thompson asked a Florida judge to declare The Florida Bar unconstitutional. He said that the Bar was engaged in a vendetta against him because of his religious beliefs, which he said conflicted with what he called the Bar's pro-gay, humanist, liberal agenda. He also said that the \\"wedding of all three functions of government into The Florida Bar, the 'official arm' of the Florida Supreme Court, is violative of the bedrock constitutional requirement of the separation powers and the 'checks and balances' which the separation guarantees.\\"Miami Review. \\"Suit Attacks Constitutionality of Bar.\\" The Recorder, 1992-06-11. Thompson accepted a $20,000 out-of-court settlement.\\"In Brief: Lawyer Accepts $20,000 Bar Settlement.\\" Miami Herald, February 5, 1993. On January 7, 2002, Thompson sent the Supreme Court of Florida a letter regarding The Florida Bar's actions. The letter was filed with the court on January 10, 2002 and was treated as a petition for a writ of mandamus against The Florida Bar.Thompson v. The Florida Bar, No. SC02-82 (Fla. 2002). Before any action was taken on the petition, Thompson sent the court another letter on January 28, 2002 voluntarily dismissing the case. The letter was filed with the court on January 30, 2002, and the Florida Supreme Court issued an order of dismissal on February 28, 2002.Thompson v. The Florida Bar, 816 So.2d 130 (Fla. 2002) (decided without opinion). In January 2006, Thompson asked the Justice Department to investigate The Florida Bar's actions. \\"The Florida Bar and its agents have engaged in a documented pattern of this illegal activity, which may sink to the level of criminal racketeering activity, in a knowing and illegal effort to chill my federal First Amendment rights,\\" Thompson wrote in a letter to Alex Acosta, interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.Jones, Carl. \\"Anti-porn crusader sues over Bar probe .\\" Broward Daily Business Review, 2006-04-13. In April 2006, Thompson filed another suit against The Florida Bar, this time in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that the Bar harassed him by investigating what he called baseless complaints made by disgruntled opponents in previous disputes. His five-count complaint asked for more than $1 million in damages. The lawsuit alleged that the Bar was pursuing baseless ethics complaints brought against Thompson by Tew Cardenas attorneys Lawrence Kellogg and Alberto Cardenas of Miami, and by two lawyers from the Philadelphia office of Blank Rome, in violation of Thompson's constitutional rights. According to the lawsuit, the Bar looked at Thompson for violations of a bar rule that prohibits attorneys from making disparaging remarks about judges, other attorneys, or court personnel. Thompson also filed a motion with the court to order the mediation of his dispute with the Bar. Thompson commented, \\"I enjoy doing what I do and I think I've got a First Amendment right to annoy people and participate in the public square in the cultural war.\\" Thompson also said he is optimistic his federal lawsuit will be successful. \\"I'm 100 percent certain that it will effect change, otherwise I would not have filed it.\\" On April 25, 2006, The Florida Bar filed a motion to dismiss Thompson's complaint. The Bar argued that Thompson's complaint should be dismissed for a number of reasons, including the fact that the complaint failed to state a claim on which he could be granted relief. The Bar also argued that it was absolutely immune from liability for actions arising out of its disciplinary functions, that the Eleventh Amendment barred Thompson's recovery of damages, and that the court should dismiss the case pursuant to the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris. On May 4, 2006, Thompson filed a motion asking Judge Federico Moreno to recuse himself from the case, as Judge Moreno was a member of The Florida Bar. Citing an \\"abundance of caution,\\" Judge Moreno recused himself on May 9, 2006 and referred the case to Chief Judge William Zloch for further action. Thompson did not, however, respond to the Bar's motion to dismiss the case. Finally, on May 17, 2006, Thompson filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with the court, and the case was dismissed without prejudice.Thompson v. The Florida Bar, No. CV-06-20945 (S.D. Fla. May 17, 2006). =Filings= In October 2007, then-Chief accessdate=2014-12-15 U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno sealed court documents submitted by Thompson in the Bar case that depicted \\"gay sex acts.\\" Thompson's submission prompted U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan to order Thompson to show cause why his actions should not be filed as a grievance with the court's Ad Hoc Committee on Attorney Admissions, Peer Review and Attorney Grievance, but the order was dismissed after Thompson promised not to file any more pornography. Thompson then sent letters to acting U.S. Attorney General Peter Keisler and U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy and Arlen Specter demanding that Jordan be removed from his position for failing to prosecute Florida attorney Norm Kent, who Thompson claimed had \\"collaborated\\" with the Bar for 20 years to discipline him.Roberts, Alana. \\"Judge Defends Sealing of Electronically Filed Porn Images \\". Daily Business Review, 2007-10-22. In February 2008, the Florida Supreme Court ordered Thompson to show cause as to why it should not reject future court filings from him unless they are signed by another The Florida Bar member. The Florida Supreme Court described his filings as \\"repetitive, frivolous and insult[ing to] the integrity of the court,\\" particularly one in which Thompson, claiming concern about \\"the court's inability to comprehend his arguments,\\" filed a motion which he called \\"A picture book for adults\\", including images of \\"swastikas, kangaroos in court, a reproduced dollar bill, cartoon squirrels, Paul Simon, Paul Newman, Ray Charles, a handprint with the word 'slap' written under it, Bar Governor Benedict P. Kuehne, Ed Bradley, Jack Nicholson, Justice Clarence Thomas, Julius Caesar, monkeys, [and] a house of cards.\\" (see ) Thompson claimed that the order \\"wildly infringes\\" on his constitutional rights and was \\"a brazen attempt\\" to repeal the First Amendment right to petition the government to redress grievances. In response, he sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, referring to the show-cause order as a criminal act done in retaliation for his seeking relief with the court.Roberts, Alana. \\"Anti-Porn Crusader May Face Sanctions for 'Meritless Filings.' \\" Daily Business Review, 2008-02-22. On March 20, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson, requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of The Florida Bar other than himself. The court noted that Thompson had responded to the show cause order with multiple \\"rambling, argumentative, and contemptuous\\" responses that characterized the show cause order as \\"bizarre\\" and \\"idiotic.\\" =Disbarment= In February 2007, The Florida Bar filed disbarment proceedings against Thompson over allegations of professional misconduct. The action was the result of separate grievances filed by people claiming that Thompson made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate them.Jones, K.C. \\"Grand Theft Auto Critic Faces Misconduct Charges .\\" InformationWeek, 2007-02-06. According to the complaint, Thompson accused Alberto Cardenas of \\"distribution of pornography to children\\", claimed that the Alabama judge presiding over the Devin Moore case \\"breaks the rules, even the Alabama State Bar Rules, because he thinks that the rules don't apply to him\\", and sent a letter to Blank Rome's managing partner, saying, \\"Your law firm has actively and knowingly facilitated by various means the criminal distribution of sexual material to minors.\\" Thompson claims that the complaints violate state religious protections because his advocacy is motivated by his Christian faith.Ostrovsky, Daniel. \\"Fla. Bar Seeks Sanctions Against Morality Watchdog Jack Thompson \\". Daily Business Review, 2007-02-09. In May 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Dava Tunis, after reviewing 2,400 pages of transcripts and 1,700 pages of exhibits, recommended that Thompson be found guilty of 27 of the 31 violations of which he had been accused, including making false statements to tribunals, disparaging and humiliating litigants and other lawyers, and improperly practicing law outside of Florida. Thompson filed a motion with the Florida Supreme Court the day after the report was issued to strike Tunis' recommendations as vague for lack of detail. Previously, Thompson had attempted to have Tunis thrown off his case, and filed a complaint against her with the state Judicial Qualifications Commission, which is responsible for investigating judges.Roberts, Alana. \\"Sanctions Hearing Set for Lawyer Found to Have Humiliated Litigants, Other Attorneys \\". Daily Business Review, 2008-05-21. On June 4, 2008, prosecutor Sheila Tuma recommended 'enhanced disbarment' for Thompson, saying that Thompson demonstrated continued misconduct, a pattern of misconduct and persistently failed to admit any wrongdoing. Enhanced disbarment lengthens the period before an attorney may reapply for admission to the bar from five years to ten. After being prevented from making a speech to begin the disciplinary hearing, Thompson distributed his written objections to lawyers, a court reporter, and a newspaper reporter, departed the courtroom, and called the proceedings against him a \\"star chamber\\" and \\"kangaroo court\\".Roberts, Alana and Shields, Billy. \\"Enhanced Disbarment Recommended due to Lawyer's Pattern of Conduct \\". Daily Business Review, 2008-06-05. On July 8, 2008, Judge Tunis recommended permanent disbarment and a $43,675.35 fine for Thompson to the Florida Supreme Court, citing \\"cumulative misconduct, a repeated pattern of behavior relentlessly forced upon numerous unconnected individuals, a total lack of remorse or even slight acknowledgment of inappropriate conduct, and continued behavior consistent with the previous public reprimand... Over a very extended period of time involving a number of totally unrelated cases and individuals, the Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of conduct to strike out harshly, extensively, repeatedly and willfully to simply try to bring as much difficulty, distraction and anguish to those he considers in opposition to his causes... He does not proceed within the guidelines of appropriate professional behavior, but rather uses other means available to intimidate, harass, or bring public disrepute to those whom he perceives oppose him.\\" The court approved the recommendation and fine on September 25, 2008, and ordered that Thompson be permanently disbarred effective 30 days from the date of the order so Thompson could close out his practice. He later filed for an emergency stay of the Florida Supreme Court's order with the U.S. District Court, which was ultimately denied. In an e-mail to media outlets, Thompson responded to the court's decision by stating, \\"The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation: This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar, the Supreme Court, and all seven of its Justices. This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit. With enemies this foolish, Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has.\\" He closed the email—in which he included the court ruling—with, \\"...this should be fun, starting now\\". On September 19, 2009, Thompson announced that he intended to resume practicing law as of October 1, 2009, claiming that he was \\"never disbarred\\" because all of the orders resulting in his disbarment were legal nullities.Thompson states disbarment 'void ab initio' He dared The Florida Bar to get a court order to stop him. Other activities In 1992, a complaint from Thompson led Florida Secretary of State Jim Smith to withhold a $25,000 grant to the Miami Film Festival; Thompson claimed that the festival was using state money to show pornographic films.Cosford, Bill. \\"Film Fest Vs Porno-Police: It's Your Choice\\". Miami Herald, 1992-03-19. In response, Thompson was named an \\"Art Censor of the Year\\" by the ACLU.\\"Arts Censors of the Year\\". Miami Herald, October 2, 1992. The next month, Thompson faced disbarment over allegations that he lied while making accusations against prominent Dade County lawyer Stuart Z Grossman.Wallace, Richard. \\"Anti-porn Crusader May Be Facing Disbarment\\". Miami Herald, 1992-04-17. Thompson ultimately admitted violating bar rules of professional conduct, including charges that he contacted people represented by an attorney without first contacting their attorneys, and agreed to pay $3,000The Florida Bar v. Thompson, 605 So. 2d 1268 (Fla. 1992) (decided without opinion). in fines and receive a public reprimand.\\"Lawyer Faces Fines, Reprimand to Resolve Case\\". Miami Herald, August 4, 1992. In 1999, Thompson represented the parents of Bryce Kilduff, an 11-year-old boy who committed suicide by hanging himself. Police believed that the death was an accident, and that Kilduff was imitating Kenny, a character from the Comedy Central series South Park, which Bryce, according to his parents, had never watched. Thompson called for Comedy Central to stop marketing the show and toys based on the series to children. \\"You see, the whole show—thrust of the show is it's—it's cool for kids to act like the characters in South Park.\\"\\"Antoinette Kilduff and Her Lawyer, John Thompson, Discuss Her Son Imitating the Cartoon Character Kenny From Popular Comedy Central's South Park and Hanging Himself\\". Today, NBC, 1999-10-11. Prior to Thompson's disbarment, attorney Norm Kent filed a personal lawsuit against him, which eventually resulted in Thompson paying Kent $50,000 for defamation. Thompson reacted to the suit by threatening employees at one of Kent's clients, Beasley Broadcast Group, with lawsuits and depositions unless they got Kent to drop his case. In January 2005, Beasley hired attorney Lawrence A. Kellogg of law firm Tew Cardenas, LLP, to manage Thompson's threats. Because Kellogg delayed arranging a meeting with him, Thompson on March 17 began a campaign targeting the firm's name partner Al Cardenas, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida, accusing him of personally being involved in \\"a statewide racketeering activity\\" in a letter sent to the media, Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist, and Florida Governor Jeb Bush. Kellogg then filed a complaint to The Florida Bar that figured largely in Thompson's disbarment. On April 30, Thompson extended his campaign against Cardenas to an attempt at embarrassing him as a trustee of Florida A&M; University, a historically black university. In an email sent to FAMU interim president Castell V. Bryant, the media, the FCC, and Governor Bush, he cites racist remarks made by a caller to The Howard Stern Show to suggest that Cardenas put \\"profit ahead of race relations\\", even though Beasley, which owned a station broadcasting Stern's show, was not among Al Cardenas's clients. On February 21, 2007, Thompson filed a complaint with the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission against Judge Larry Seidlin, accusing Seidlin of \\"violating nearly every judicial canon\\" in conducting a hearing on the disposition of the body of Anna Nicole Smith.McMahon, Paula. \\"Anna Nicole Smith's mother says she plans to appeal \\". South Florida Sun- Sentinel, 2007-02-23. On June 28, 2007, Thompson filed a complaint with the State Attorney's Office, asking for an investigation and possible prosecution regarding accusations that Seidlin inappropriately accepted expensive gifts.Alanez, Tonya. \\"Attorney's Office seeks investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Broward Circuit Judge Larry Seidlin\\". South Florida Sun- Sentinel, 2007-06-30. In March 2008, Thompson called for the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division to immediately suspend the law license of former state governor Eliot Spitzer, who had resigned from the position amidst reports he was a client of a prostitution ring. Thompson said that the Disciplinary Committee for the Appellate Division's First Department should stop Spitzer from practicing law until the matter was resolved, noting that Spitzer did not claim innocence in his initial public apology.\\"Lawyer wants Spitzer suspended from NY bar\\". Staten Island Live, 2008-03-11. In an April 2016 interview with Inverse, Thompson stated that he was teaching civics classes to inmates in the Florida prison system, including an American history and constitutional law class at the Everglades Correctional Institution.Wilbur, Brock. \\"Attorney Jack Thompson And His Personal Vendetta Against Video Games \\". Inverse, 2016-04-07. =Facebook lawsuit= Thompson filed a lawsuit for $40 million against Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on September 29, 2009. Thompson claimed that the social networking site had caused him \\"great harm and distress\\" by not removing angry postings made by users in several Facebook groups. Thompson withdrew his case less than two months later. According to Parry Aftab, a cyber-law attorney, Thompson would likely not have had any success because the U.S. Communications Decency Act provides that companies such as Facebook have no liability for what users do with their services in most cases.

During this period, Masłowski drew a lot from nature, including between 1865 and 1871 in Bronów near Poddębice at a father's friends – Maria and Jarosław Konopnicki (see story by Konopnicka: \\"How do Children in Bronów with Rozalia Entertained\\", where one of these \\"children\\" was \\"Staś\\" – the future artist;See: (Polish) http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Jak_si%C4%99_dzieci_w_Bronowie_z_Rozali%C4%85_bawi%C5%82y (Maria Konopnicka: \\"How do children in Bronów with Rozalia Entertained\\" in Wikiźródła, acc.: 2012:11:18) and then in Jędrzejów, where lived Wincenty Danilewicz, his grandfather. He was also copying Juliusz Kossak's pictures from illustrated magazines. =Art studies= Duma), oil/canvas, 1879 Since 1871 Stanisław Masłowski lived in Warsaw, where his father was transferred by court administration. His studies at the Warsaw School of Drawing (i.e. Wojciech Gerson's drawing school) lasted perhaps permanently in 1871–1875. \\"In this school I received – finds the artist in an autobiographical note – the advice of Mr. Gerson and Mr. A.Kaminski.\\" In 1875 Masłowski received the silver medal of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, as an award for his school drawings. During this period he took an active part in the life of the famous atelier rented by a group of artists-painters: J. Chełmoński, S. Witkiewicz, A.Piotrowski and others in the \\"Hotel Europejski\\" in Warsaw. Sincere affection for his colleagues from \\"Europe\\" (as he called it) remained him for the rest of his life.(Polish) Polski Słownik Biograficzny, Wrocław- Warszawa-Kraków-Gdańsk 1975 (ed. Polska Akad. Nauk – Zakł. Narod. im. Ossolińskich), vol.XX/1, op.cit.p.129 However it was Ukraine, which gave to young Masłowski many painting emotions. For the first time he went there accompanied by writer Edward Chłopicki (1875). The second trip took place in 1876 (with this Ukrainian visit a number of Masłowski's letters to the artist- painter Władysław Leszczyński are involved). The next trips took place at least in 1878, and 1886. In 1884–1887 Stanisław Masłowski entered a new phase of creativity and a new environment. At that time, he developed close relations with the group of friendly painters and writers associated with \\"Wędrowiec\\" weekly magazine, including Aleksander Gierymski and Antoni Sygietyński, and young painters: Józef Pankiewicz and Władysław Podkowiński. In 1886 Maslowski spent half a year in Munich, where – as he writes – \\"worked at home.\\" Spring of 1905 – the Cossacks party at Ujazdowskie Avenue in Warsaw), oil/canvas, 1906 (National Museum in Warsaw) In Masłowski's creativity, years 1890–1907, was called a period of \\"the storm and ferment\\". Its initial phase is characterized by transition through impressionism and get away from it to find his own form. In 1897 Stanisław Masłowski became a member of the Society of Polish Artists \\"Sztuka\\" in Kraków, created at the initiative of Jan Stanisławski. A number of artists came from Warsaw e.g.: Józef Pankiewicz and Konstanty Laszczka. In 1899 Masłowski issued a number of watercolours in Aleksander Krywult Salon; this year and in 1902 he took part in the exhibitions of the Vienna Secession. In 1900 he traveled to Italy and Paris. In 1900 at the Universal Exhibition in Paris, he gained a medal award for picture \\"The market in the Kazimierz\\". In 1901 he demonstrated a small watercolours in the \\"Chimera\\" monthly editorial. Collective exhibition in 1902 in the Zachęta ends the second phase of Masłowski's creative explorations. The restless period of 1902–1907 points out the artist's first trip in 1903 to Wola Rafałowska between Mińsk Mazowiecki and Siedlce, where he soon found his synthesis of his Polish landscape. In the following year he began a series of trips to Italy. In 1904 – to Rome, Florence, Fiesole, but also to Troki near Wilno. The special exhibition on \\"Zachęta\\" (1904) demonstrated Masłowski's 58 water-colours. In 1905–1907 Masłowski worked in his atelier in Warsaw (at Mokotowska street) and experimented. Period of 1907–1926 was a phase of prosperity and decline of Masłowski's creativity. Plein air in Nowosiółka in Volhynia in 1908 brought 18 watercolours, which then was exhibited in the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts (Polish abbr.: TZSP). In 1909 and 1910 Masłowski had a solo exhibition there, and then exhibited there annually until 1914 the landscapes from Italy, Tunisia and from Polish village Wola Rafałowska. In 1913 Masłowski arranged a small exhibition of watercolours in the Galerie Léon Marseille in Paris. In June 1914 Masłowski received an invitation to taking a position as professor at the Warsaw School of Fine Arts. However he not accepted the proposition. The outbreak of the World War I found him in the country. In April 1916 the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts arranged Masłowski's big collective exhibition. In December of that year he received the jubilee award of Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts. The end of the war in 1918, brought great moral relaxation. Maslowski then painted a picture \\"Beliniacy\\" (related to name of one of Polish patriotic military divisions). =Interwar period= In 1921 Masłowski was elected a member of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1922 he made another trip to Italy. In 1925 a jubilee exhibition of Masłowski's works was held in the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts. The next year, Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts issued a premium reproduction of his painting \\"Jarema's Duma\\" (of 1879). In 1925 Maslowski was awarded Officer's Cross of Polonia Restituta. Market_square in Kazimierz Dolny, watercolor, 1899 (National Museum in Warsaw) In the last year of life, suffering from a heart disease, he little worked. He died 31 May 1926 in WarsawSee.: (Polish) Masłowski M. [coll.]: Stanisław Masłowski – Materiały do życiorysu i twórczości (Stanisław Masłowski – Materials for the Biography and Works), Wrocław 1957, p.232. and was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw, in the tomb of his mother's family (section 11-1-7/8, cf. the information boards behind the entrance of the \\"Saint Honorata\\" gate in the category: \\"Plastycy\\", i.e. \\"Artists\\"). A free time Maslowski was spending on your favorite readings of both the Old Polish literature, and foreign – mostly French or Italian (his favorite reading was Montaigne's writings – the book found by the bed after his death).See.: (Polish) Masłowski M. [coll.]: Stanisław Masłowski – Materiały do życiorysu i twórczości (Stanisław Masłowski – Materials for the Biography and Works), Wrocław 1957, p.232. A peculiar fruit of his reading was a translation into Polish of Giorgio Vasari's \\"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\\" (probably for the first time before World War ISee: (Polish) Giorgio Vasari: Żywoty najsławniejszych malarzy, rzeźbiarzy i architektów (Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), Warszawa 1989, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy – PIW, p.XXXVI – where K.Estreicher – (author of introduction and notes) writes: \\"We felt the need for a translation of the works of Vasari. Before World War I it was S.Masłowski, who translated the 'Lives', next it was J.Morawiński in interwar period. Manuscripts of these translations preserved.\\") He was married (from 20 February 1897) to Aniela Ponikowska – sister of Cezary Ponikowski, lawyer (advocate-attorney), the first President of the Supreme Advocates Council in Poland (after restore of the independence of Poland, in 1918). They had son Maciej Masłowski, an art historian (born in Warsaw 24 January 1901, died in Wysokie Mazowieckie 17 August 1976). Works Masłowski's artistic talent occurred already at an early age. He received a silver medal in 1875 from the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, for his school drawings. \\"Masłowski – recalls Henryk Piątkowski (painter) – while still very young boy, as a student at the Warsaw School of Drawing (i.e. Wojciech Gerson's drawing school) marked his outstanding talent in the first creative gusts\\" – and adds, that – \\"he learned mostly not in school, but in the environment of Polish nature, which he felt and spoke with the mastery\\". These observations complements and confirms relation of his fellow Miłosz Kotarbinski, in which we can read of the \\"very distinctive in school, and not yet appreciated Stanisław Masłowski. He was already a naturally born impressionist. Studies on the plaster casts of classical sculpture he led in purely impressive mode, in which forgiving executives completely did not complain. With vividly colourful and scenic landscape studies of nature he overtook most ardent later Impressionists.\\"A similar opinion on Masłowski's painting expressed Irena Piotrowska, who wrote that his \\"noble landscape views mark the borderline of the Realism and Impressionism.\\" – see: Irena Piotrowska: The Art of Poland, Philosophical Library Publishers, New York, 1947, p.89 (Chapter XIII – Polish landscape painting) Koń na Kapitolu (The Horse statue in the entrance to Capitoline Hill – Campidoglio), Rome, watercolor, 1904 (National Museum in Warsaw) The year 1875 brought in Masłowski's life the first images exhibited in the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, namely: \\"Owczarek\\" (\\"The Shepherd\\") and \\"Kozacy\\" (\\"Cossacks\\"), then – the first illustrations included in the \\"Kłosy\\" Weekly Magazine, and the first trip to Ukraine. Ukrainian topic had a strong influence on Masłowski in his youth. It was carrying parallel: blustering vigor and lyrical musing. That was the Ukraine, which Maslowski saw and began to enact in his studio compositions. It was unlike the painting of the noble- knight's and hunter's Ukraine by Juliusz Kossak, Józef Brandt and Józef Chełmoński. A numerous images of Ukrainian themes may be mentioned: \\"Odbicie branki\\" (Reflection from Captive – exhibited 1878), \\"Pożegnanie Kozaka\\" (Farewell Cossack – illustration, 1878), \\"Jarema's Duma\\" (1879), \\"Chłopcy w stepie\\" (Boys in the Steppe – illustration, 1879), \\"Noc\\" (Night – exhibited in 1880), \\"Tabun\\" (Herd of Horses, 1880), \\"Odpoczynek czumaka\\" (Chumak's Rest, 1880), \\"Wesele\\" (The Wedding, 1881), \\"Odpoczynek\\" (The Rest, 1882), and finally \\"Taniec Kozaków\\" (Cossacks Dance – Kozachok, 1883), which is a kind of closure and synthesis of the whole. At this, however, does not exhaust the subject matter and the topography of Masłowski's paintings created in atelier, in early stages of his work. It happens a Masovian village (\\"Na pastwisku\\" – en.: \\"On the Pasture\\", 1880), and even melodrama (\\"Niedola\\" – en.: \\"Misery\\", 1881), but still the Ukraine was the main emphasis of his contemporary work. Masłowski's studio painting of this period can not be reduced to a common denominator; his realism has a number of editions – closer to the romantic sentiments, or closer to the truth of nature. Generally speaking, Masłowski's way goes from linearity to ornamentation, from value to colour, from oil to watercolour, and in total – from atelier to plein air. Pejzaż jesienny z Rybiniszek (Autumn Landscape of Rybiniszki), watercolour, 1902 (National Museum in Warsaw) The most interesting result of the Ukrainian and other Masłowski's expeditions were quite precursory studies and sketches from nature – watercolours, pencils, and oils, including \\"Trójka bałagulska\\" (a Three- Horse Carriage, National Museum, Kraków), \\"Studium konia\\" (Study of a Horse – ibid.), \\"Zima\\" (Winter – ibid.), \\"Cyganka\\" (Gypsy woman, 1877, formerly in Bohdan Wydżga collections), \\"Studium jamnika\\" (Study of Dachshund), \\"Szczeniaki\\" (Puppies – owned by the artist's family), \\"Studium psa\\" (Study of a Dog), \\"Głowy byków\\" (Bulls Heads – National Museum in Warsaw), \\"Oset\\" (Thistle, between 1876 and 1878, reproduced as a vignette in the \\"Sfinks\\" Monthly ecession magazine in 1909 and 1912). Their cognitive function rapidly transformed and expanded. One of the most interesting studies arose during a few days stay in the Gypsy camp behind the Warsaw-Praga Turnpike. But first fame, and even financial success brought him no pioneer \\"minor sketches\\" but \\"Duma Jaremy\\" (Jarema's Duma) and \\"Taniec Kozaków\\" (Cossacks Dance – Kozachok, reproduced in the booklet No 11 of \\"Album of Polish Painters\\" (Polish: \\"Album malarzy polskich\\", ed. Warsaw 1885). In 1884–1887 Stanisław Masłowski entered into a new phase of creativity. He came into a close relationship with a fellow group of painters and writers associated with \\"Wędrowiec\\" (en.: \\"The Wanderer\\") weekly magazine, i.e. with Aleksander Gierymski and Antoni Sygietyński, with young Józef Pankiewicz and Władysław Podkowiński. This period already in 1884 resulted in large oil-composition done in the atelier, which is a landscape entitled \\"Wschód Księżyca\\" (en.: \\"Moonrise\\", National Museum in Cracow – in the \\"Cloth Hall\\" Department). In Masłowski's painting now pushed to the fore the problem of light in the night and day – the colour issue parallel to the value question. Masłowski's painting underwent profound changes during this period. This is evidenced also by following paintings: \\"Wschód słońca\\" (en.: Sunrise, 1886), and next: \\"Zachód słońca\\" (en.: Sunset, 1887), \\"Targ na Mariensztacie\\" (en.: Market on Mariensztat, ca 1887), \\"Południe\\" (en.: Noon, ca 1888). These images pave Masłowski's way to Impressionism. Gerson in criticism in 1888 notes: \\"Mr. Masłowski sent to the exhibition a \\"Mazovian Cottage\\" – a watercolour painting of rare beauty and strength\\".(Polish) Gerson W.: Wystawa TZSP (TZSP Exhibition), Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly) 1888, vol. I, p.410 Gerson sees in it a lot of brightness, richness, strength of color, plasticity. At this time a new topic appears in Masłowski's works – the city of Warsaw. Particularly interesting came out a numerous notes from Iron-Gate Square in Warsaw. From this period come a numerous watercolour studies of Masovia, picking Masłowski in a row of \\"the first Polish Plein air-ists and Impressionists\\" (S. Rutkowski).(Polish) Rutkowski S.: Stanisław Masłowski (1853–1926), \\"Sztuki Piękne\\" (\\"Fine Arts\\") vol.1926, No 10-11 Fountain at Palazzo Colonna Garden in Rome, watercolor on paper, 1904 (National Museum in Warsaw) The years 1890–1907 were a \\"period of storm and ferment\\" in Masłowski work. Its initial phase – was to go through Impressionism, and then move away from it in search of its own, separate forms. The first attempt towards a new image was reportedly \\"Pocztylion\\" (en.: Postman, 1890), and then \\"Targ na Grzybowie\\" (en.: Market on Grzybów district of Warsaw, 1892), \\"Ostatnie promienie\\" (en.: Last rays), \\"Przed poborem\\" (en.: Before the Conscription, 1892). Next years brought a numerous and still a new trials and experiments, ranging between Impressionism and Neo-romanticism. In 1893 Maslowski issued, inter alia, \\"Stare miasto\\" (en.: Old Town) and \\"Poranek\\" (en.: Morning) and in 1894 – \\"Mickiewicz and Maryla\\" and \\"Porwanie\\" (en.:Kidnapping); in 1895 – \\"Wiosna\\" (en.: Spring); in 1896 – \\"Sprawa o granicę\\" (en.: The Case of the Border)(Polish) Jankowski J.: Wstęp do reprodukcji obrazu Masłowskiego Spór o granicę (Introduction to the Reproduction of Masłowski Picture: \\"Border Dispute\\" Maslowski ), Album sztuki polskiej i obcej (Album of Polish and Foreign Art), Warsaw 1907 – 1910 (ed. S. Orgelbrand) and \\"Bociany\\" (en.: Storks). All these were big oil compositions. It seems that far-reaching attempt in the direction of divisionist, speckle technique of painting was image entitled: \\"Poranek\\" (en.: Morning). The year 1896 brought synthesis of previous efforts, as exemplified by two major themes: \\"Sprawa o granicę\\" (en.: Case of the Border) and \\"Bociany\\" (en.: Storks). Great collective exhibition in the Krywult exhibition room of art in Warsaw in 1896, closed most turbulent phase of a new period of Maslowski's painting. =Turn of the century= Lupin – A Cart way), watercolor, 1909 (National Museum in Warsaw) In 1899, Masłowski exhibited a dozen of watercolours in Krywult exhibition room. This year and in 1902 he participated in the exhibitions of the Vienna Secession. In 1900 he traveled to Italy and Paris. In 1901, in the editorial of \\"Chimera\\" monthly magazine, he presented a set of small watercolours. Here are the leading Masłowski's works of these years. Of 1898 come paintings: \\"Chart\\" (en.: Greyhound), \\"Portret dziewczynki\\" (en. Portrait of a Girl), \\"Giewont we mgle\\" (en. Giewont Tatra Peak in the Mist); then of 1899 – \\"Rynek w Kazimierzu\\" (en. Market Square in Kazimierz), and \\"Kapliczka w Kazimierzu\\" (en. A Wayside Shrine in Kazimierz), and finally of 1902 – a big image of \\"Cyganka\\" (en.: Gypsy Woman), landscapes of Rybiniszki (former Polish Livonia now in Eastern Latvia),(Polish) Trzebiński M.: Pamiętnik malarza (Diary of a Painter ), Wrocław 1958 \\"Wrona\\" (en. Crow), \\"Kamienica pod Okrętem\\" (en. \\"Tenement under Ship\\" in Warsaw Old Town). It is worth noting that these are only watercolours. A Picture \\"Rynek w Kazimierzu\\" (en.: Market Square in Kazimierz) was awarded the medal on the Universal Exhibition in Paris (1900). A collective show of his paintings in 1902, in the Zachęta (i.e. Society for Encouragement of Fine Arts) ends the second phase of Masłowski's explorations. Of the numerous reviews deserves reminder E. Niewiadomski's sentence: \\"Masłowski's place will be in the same series, in which were artists otherwise of different measure: Kossak Juliusz, Matejko, Grottger, Chełmoński, Piechowski. He is a national artist through and through. National are the motives of his works and their concepts, the national temperament, life gushing from images, colour strength [...]\\". In 1903 Maslowski tried his hand in decorative arts – painting a ceiling in the ballroom and chapel choir in a palace at Supraśl. Gryka (Buckwheat Field Landscape), watercolour, Wola Rafałowska, 1922 (National Museum, Kraków, courtesy of Photo Laboratory, National Museum in Kraków) The special exhibition in the \\"Zachęta\\" (1904) demonstrated 58 Masłowski's watercolours. In 1905–1907 Maslowski worked experimenting in his Warsaw studio (at Mokotowska street).

In the following years, until 1914, he exhibited in the \\"Zacheta\\" – Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts the landscapes of Italy, Tunisia and Polish of Wola Rafałowska village, including: \\"Podwórze w Villi d'Este \\" (Courtyard at Villa d'Este),\\"Zatoka Neapolitańska\\" (Bay of Naples), \\"Krowy\\" (The Cows), \\"Białe maki\\" (White Poppies – the field of corn poppies), \\"Chojar\\" (A Single Old pine-Tree), \\"Motyw z Taorminy\\" (Theme from Taormina), \\"Beduinka\\" (Bedouin Woman), \\"Wejście do Pałacu Beja\\" (Entrance to the Bey Palace),\\"Kawiarnia arabska\\" (Arabic Cafe) and other. All of them presented an unusual wealth of colour and decoration, a rare freshness and directness of vision. Examples of watercolor paintings from this period are the images of \\"Poppies\\" and \\"A Hollyhocks in the Garden\\" (1911). There were also oil pictures at that time.

The township ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. History Commonly called Lower Dublin, a township in the upper part of the county, adjoining Moreland and Byberry Townships on the south, extending southeast nearly in a parallel line to the Poquessing Creek and the Delaware River. Bustleton, Fox Chase and Holmesburg were in this township. It was originally about five miles at its greatest length and three miles in breadth, with an area of 9,500 acres (38 km²). It was bisected by the Pennypack Creek, known in those days as the Dublin Creek. This township was formerly called Lower Dublin to distinguish it from another Dublin township, formerly in Philadelphia County, but now in Montgomery County, and there called Upper Dublin. This township was one of the first created in the county, but the date is not known. In 1853, about half the area of the township was separated out into Delaware Township, which comprised what are now the Torresdale and Holmesburg sections of the city of Philadelphia.

The commission studied work conditions throughout the industrial United States between 1913 and 1915. The final report of the Commission, published in eleven volumes in 1916, contain tens of thousands of pages of testimony from a wide range of witnesses, including Clarence Darrow, Louis Brandeis, Mary Harris \\"Mother\\" Jones, Theodore Schroeder, William \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, scores of ordinary workers, and the titans of capitalism, including Daniel Guggenheim, George Walbridge Perkins, Sr. (of U.S. Steel), Henry Ford, and Andrew Carnegie. 40 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 557 p. 573 Predecessors In 1871, there was a failed attempt to create an Industrial Commission. There was also the Hewitt committee hearings of 1878–79, the three-year study of the Blair committee which ended in 1886, and a probe conducted from 1898 to 1902 by the United States Industrial Commission, appointed by President William McKinley. p. 3 Origins Rubble of the Times building after the bombing In 1910, two leaders of the Structural Ironworkers Union, the McNamara Brothers, dynamited the Los Angeles Times building, killing twenty people. There was public outcry as a result, and President William Howard Taft proposed the creation of a nine-person investigative committee called the Commission on Industrial Relations, which was approved by CongressKaufman p. 8 to be formally created April 23, 1912. Its findings were filed April 23, 1915. The Commission on Industrial Relations got its name from a petition presented to President Taft on December 30, 1911, entitled \\"Petition to the President for a Federal Commission on Industrial Relations,\\" signed by 28 prominent people,Kaufman p. 200 Members of the Committee on Standards of Living and Labor of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections, many of whom were associated with Survey magazine, such as Paul Underwood Kellogg and John A. Fitch.McCartin p. 18 Commission members The Commission was made up of nine commissioners, all nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. All but one served from beginning to end. The original nine Commissioners were: * Chairman Frank P. Walsh, Kansas City, Missouri labor lawyer and activist (who once told a friend \\"I hate like hell to be respectable\\"),McCartin p. 22 * James O'Connell, of the American Federation of Labor (A.F.L.) * Austin B. Garretson, of the Order of Railway Conductors * John Brown Lennon, of the A.F.L. * Frederic A. Delano, President of the Wabash Railroad (and uncle of Franklin Roosevelt) * Florence Jaffray Harriman, a New York socialite and social activist * Harris Weinstock, a progressive California businessman * S. Thruston Ballard, a Kentucky democratic flour mill owner Shortly before the Commission's final report, Commissioner Delano resigned, and was replaced by Richard Aishton, vice- president of the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. Among the Commission staff were John R. Commons, a labor economist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Luke Grant, a labor journalist and editor of the Chicago Inter Ocean. Only one of Grant's reports on the structural ironworkers bombing campaign was actually published by the CIR. However, an explosive report by Grant \\"Violence in Labor Disputes and Methods of Policing Industry\\" was never published and is only available in draft form from the National Archives and Wisconsin Historical Society. Congress had authorized the Commission shortly before the 1912 presidential election, in which incumbent President Taft was defeated by New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson. Four Commissioners ultimately confirmed were originally named by President Taft in December 1912, one month after his defeat: Commissioners Delano, O'Connell, Garretson and Lennon. Taft also nominated five other persons, but the Senate failed to confirm them. Those failed nominees were U.S. Senator George Sutherland of Utah (who was Taft's proposed chairman), Connecticut state legislator George B. Chandler (American Book Co.), Charles S. Barrett (Farmers' Union); Adolph Lewisohn (investment banker, copper magnate, and philanthropist); and F. C. Schwedtman (electrical engineer). Two months after entering the White House,McCartin p. 19 President Wilson nominated replacements for Taft's five failed nominees. Investigation The Commission's responsibilities were to: :\\"inquire into the general condition of labor in the principal industries of the United States, including agriculture, and especially in those which are carried on in corporate forms ...; into the growth of associations of employers and of wage earners and the effect of such associations upon the relations between employers and employees ...\\" The commission held 154 days of hearings. Walsh's leadership of the Commission attracted media attention and publicity. Some of the commission findings included: #The Commission found that lumber workers in the Northwest labored at their jobs for ten hours a day at only twenty cents an hour. #Seasonal unemployment affected tens of thousands of people in Pacific Coast cities. Only the fortunate averaged more than a meal a day. #In California, migrant laborers work in fields with temperatures up to 105 degrees on farms where growers refused to supply them water in the fields. #One Paterson, New Jersey, silk mill fined workers fifty cents for talking and fifty cents for laughing while at work.McCartin, p. 25 \\"In an era of...muckraking, the [commission] raised the technique to an unprecedented height.\\" The commission studied several major strikes which occurred during its investigations, including: #The Paterson, New Jersey, silk mill strike (1911–1913), led by the Industrial Workers of the World, #New York City garment workers strike (1909–1910), #Illinois Central and Harriman lines struggles with the railroad shopmen (1911–1915), #The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company strike, where the Ludlow Massacre occurred (1913–1914). When Walsh embarrassed President Wilson, and suggested investigating the southern states, U.S. Senator Hoke Smith of Georgia attempted to cut Walsh's budget 75 percent. The vote failed, and Walsh promptly sent investigators to Smith's state, making lasting and powerful enemies.McCartin, p. 26 Journalist Walter Lippman stated there was \\"an atmosphere of no quarter\\" when Walsh subpoenaed and then questioned John D. Rockefeller, Jr. about the Ludlow massacre. For three days Walsh publicly chastised Rockefeller.McCartin, p. 26, 28 Historian Montgomery stated that the commission found: :\\"repression by police, judicial, and military agencies, which envisaged themselves as the defenders of society's 'good people.' And in each case but Philadelphia, where the public as a whole was irate over the general conduct of the transit company, the 'good people' in turn endorsed the repression. Small wonder that in all these strikes, and above all in the sanguinary three-year conflict on the Illinois Central Railroad, workers simply took the law into their own hands.\\" Commission conclusions Unable to agree on many points, the Commission published three different final reports.McCartin, p. 13 One of the reports — primarily written by Commissioner Commons, with Commissioner Harriman — was signed by a bare majority of five Commissioners. Instead of calling for \\"industrial democracy,\\" the Commons' report instead advocated the creation of impartial labor boards. It did not characterize conflict between labor and management as an inevitable and permanent condition. Commons' report expressed fear that the Commission's report would \\"throw the [labor] movement into politics.\\" The report signed by chairman Walsh and commissioners Lennon, O'Connell and Garretson, written by attorney Basil Manly, was much more provocative and accusatory in its tone and conclusions.Commission, p. 269 Its centerpiece was a call for industrial democracy and Henry George's 'Single Tax' on land values. That report explained the conditions of agricultural estates: :\\"It is industrial feudalism in an extreme form. Such estates are, as a rule, the property of absentee landlords, who are for the most part millionaires, resident in the eastern States or in Europe.\\" p. 25 64th Cong., 1st sess., 1916, S.Doc. 415 (Google Print—Entire document online) Regarding conditions in company towns, the Manly report observed that they displayed \\"every aspect of feudalism except the recognition of special duties on the part of the employer.\\" p.10 A separate supplemental statement joined only by Commissioners Lennon and O'Connell opposed the creation of an agency-administered system of mediation and arbitration, in favor of strengthening trade unions (and employer associations). Their statement concluded: :\\"Where (labor) organization is lacking, dangerous discontent is found on every hand; low wages and long hours prevail; exploitation in every direction is practiced; the people become sullen, have no regard for law and government, and are, in reality, a latent volcano, as dangerous to society as are the volcanoes of nature to the landscape surrounding them.\\" :\\"We hold that efforts to stay the organization of labor or to restrict the right of employees to organize should not be tolerated, but that the opposite policy should prevail, and the organization of the trade unions and of the employers' organizations should be promoted...This country is no longer a field for slavery, and where men and women are compelled, in order that they may live, to work under conditions in determining which they have no voice, they are not far removed from a condition existing under feudalism or slavery.\\"Commission, p. 165. Public response The New Republic observed that the commission had gone well beyond its duties to investigate the \\"cause and cure\\" of labor unrest. In promoting industrial democracy, it offered a \\"tonic\\" for American democracy itself. The Seattle Union Record exclaimed that the report was \\"an indictment against organized capital. The journal The Masses stated the report signaled \\"the beginning of an indigenous American revolutionary movement. Others criticized the report. The New York Herald characterized the Commission's president as \\"a Mother Jones in trousers.\\" In 1916, Republican Presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes called the commission \\"one of the tragic incidents of the present administration\\" which had \\"accomplished nothing\\".McCartin, p. 34. The president of the Pittsburgh Employers' Association stated publicly that Walsh \\"should be assassinated.\\" p. 115 106 Yale L.J. 941 Longterm influence The influence the report had on US politics is debated among historians. Graham Adams, Jr. argues and Louis Galambos agrees that the Commission's hearings and reports influenced the passage of such labor legislation as the Adamson Eight- Hour Act. Historian Rayback explains that the commission's report influenced the decisions of the War Labor Board and the authors of New Deal labor legislation. David Montgomery states: :\\"The uniqueness of the efforts of the Commission on Industrial Relations between 1913 and 1915 lay in its staff of Wisconsin-trained experts and in the steadfast refusal of its nine members to allow any diversion of their attention from immediate problems of industrial relations. These very qualities paradoxically imparted to the commission a political significance greater than that of all previous investigations combined, for out of its work emerged both a labor program for the Democratic party in 1916 which shattered the narrow limits of its 1912 platform and, through the minority report of John R. Commons and Mrs. J. Borden Harriman, a series of proposals that were to become widely infused into the welfare capitalism of the 1920s.\\" On the other hand, LaFayette Harter argues that the commission had been established to determine the roots of labor problems, but its liberal leanings caused Congress to ignore its findings.Kaufman, p. 9. George Brooks, reviewing Adams' book, contends that despite the fact that Frank P. Walsh later became cochairman, with William Howard Taft, of the War Labor Board during World War I that \\"it is an exaggeration to assume that the Commission was the principal, or even a major, cause of subsequent developments and to attribute to it, as [Adams] does, the development of \\"a more steeply graduated tax structure, promotion of collective bargaining, minimum wage scales, and the eight-hour day... .\\" There is nothing in [Adams book] which would support the view that the Commission ever had the importance of the La Follette or McClellan Committees.\\" See also *US labor law Notes References * 11 volumes – online internet archive * 64th Cong., 1st sess., 1916, S.Doc. 415 (Google Print—Entire document online) * Category:History of labor relations in the United States Category:History of the United States Congress Industrial Relations Category:Progressive Era in the United States ","title":"Commission on Industrial Relations"},{"id":"5043575","text":"Don't Wanna Be Here was the first single for the band Cool for August and was also released as a CD single in Australia in 1997.

It lies on the southwest ridge of the Ultar Sar massif, the most southeasterly of the major groups of the Batura Muztagh. The whole massif rises precipitously above the Hunza Valley to the southeast. Bublimotin, while having little prominence above the saddle with nearby Hunza Peak, is particularly notable for being a sharp, relatively snowless rock spire among snow peaks. This, combined with its height above the valley, makes it quite eye-catching; hence the distinctive name. It provides a rock climb (with a very serious alpine approach) and has been the scene of some notable paragliding. An interesting folk tale about the peak (Bubli mo Ting literally means 'Bubli's peak) is that Kisar, a (magical) prince from Baltistan, came to Hunza on one of his adventures and married a princess, a gas, called Bubli. When he received news that his first wife in Baltistan, Langabrumo, had been kidnapped (by a phut or a deu, one story says, but according to Lorimer's book it is a king from another country), he immediately made preparations to set off and rescue her. He took Bubli up to this mountain, (later named after her) and handed her a sack of grain as well as a hen or chicken (a qarqamuts). She must have asked whether - and when - he would be back, and he told her: \\"Every year give this chicken a single grain to eat. When the sack is empty, I will return. Until that time, stay here.\\" He left, and, they say, Bubli is waiting there still.

In a forty-seven race career, despite finishing off the board while losing all 5 of his races outside California, he won seventeen times with his major victories including three Hollywood Gold Cups, two Santa Anita Handicaps and the Pacific Classic Stakes. Background Lava Man is dark bay thoroughbred gelding with a white blaze on his forehead. His dam L'il Ms. Leonard was claimed by Lonnie Arterburn for $16,000 and then sent to Kentucky to be bred to Slew City Slew, a son of Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. Kim and Eve Kuhlman acquired a half interest in L'il Ms. Leonard and kept her at their farm in Kentucky before shipping her back to California. Lava Man was foaled on March 20, 2001 at Poplar Meadows Ranch near Sanger, California. He originally ran as a homebred for Arterburn and the Kuhlmans, and was trained by Arterburn. Eve Kuhlmann, who competes in triathlons, named the horse Lava Man for a triathlon on the Big Island in Hawaii. Lava Man is known for both his intelligent and friendly personality and his \\"tenacity, courage and adaptability\\" on the track. A jockey who regularly rode Lava Man, Corey Nakatani, has said of him, \\"This horse has gears, so many gears. What a horse. He's just about unbelievable.\\" Racing career =Early career= Lava Man first raced as a 2-year-old in a $12,500 maiden claiming race at the San Joaquin County Fair in June 2003, finishing fourth and earning a paltry Beyer Speed Figure of 27. The Fair Circuit is the lowest level of thoroughbred competition in California thoroughbred racing. Arterburn said he was a big, long-striding horse that never got tired. \\"But he was so laid back he could be a pony. He didn't show anything in the mornings. I took him out to Stockton, California to get him a race, make him eligible for starter allowances and not get him claimed away.\\" In the words of Daily Racing Form columnist Dick Jerardi, \\"Lava Man did not start his career on the other side of the tracks. He started his career in a place [Stockton] where there are no tracks.\\" Lava Man lost his next two races before Arterburn tried him on the grass. The horse won for the first time on November 29 at Golden Gate Fields, then followed up with an allowance race win in January 2004. He then lost his next four races, shipping between Santa Anita, Bay Meadows and Hollywood Park, before earning his third win after Arterburn removed his blinkers. Arterburn then entered him in a $62,500 claiming race at Del Mar Racetrack because, as he said, \\"We had no other place to run him so we took him south. It was the usual Northern California problem.\\" He came in sixth, so in his next race, Arterburn dropped him down a notch in a $50,000 claiming race on August 13. In that race, Lava Man was claimed by Doug O'Neill for owner Steve Kenly, who was looking for a useful California-bred for his STD Stables. \\"I never should have run him back down there,\\" said Arterburn. \\"You go down to that claiming pit at Del Mar and you're asking for trouble. They claim crazy down there, and I never should have taken him there. I really liked the horse. He had a great personality; almost a clown. He was like a big kid, always wanting attention. He was a one of a kind character, and we tried to protect him the best we could.\\" Now racing for O'Neill,Lava Man won the Derby Trial Stakes at Fairplex, then finished third in the Pomono Derby. O'Neill initially kept the horse on turf, but then moved him back to dirt where he finished second in three straight races, including a promising performance behind Rock Hard Ten in the Grade 1 Malibu Stakes. Lava Man finished his three-year-old season with three wins and six seconds from thirteen starts. =2005= At the start of his 2005 campaign, Lava Man was badly beaten in his first three starts, finishing seventh, fifth and sixth, with one of these being the Sunshine Millions Classic at Gulfstream Park in Florida. O'Neill re-fitted the horse with blinkers, then entered him in a $100,000 claiming race in May. Lava Man won but was not claimed as Arterburn lacked the funds to do so at the time. Arterburn would later call Lava Man \\"the best and worst thing that ever happened to me\\" after the horse started winning major races for O'Neill. However, because California-breds winning open races in the state generate breeders' rewards worth approximately 15 percent of the purse, Arterburn continued to receive a share of some of Lava Man's earnings as his co-breeder. On June 18, Lava Man won the Californian Stakes for his first graded stakes victory. In his next race, the $750,000 Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup in July, Lava Man won by a stakes-record margin of over 8 lengths and earned his career-high Beyer Speed Figure of 120 while carrying the highweight. Kenly later said, \\"The first Gold Cup, that was the biggest race we’d ever run in, and that was the most special because it was our first.\\" In August, Lava Man entered the Pacific Classic in which he led for most of the race but was caught near the wire and finished third. Despite the loss, O'Neill considered the race one of his finest efforts. \\"He just laid his body down – what a huge race\\", said O'Neill. \\"He was just rubber-legged, like a boxer, just no legs. He was okay. We got him back to the barn, got him drinking, got a hose on him right away, and he finally came to. But you don't see many horses run that hard to where they’re rubber-legged. They usually stop miles before that happens.\\" Lava Man was so exhausted he had to be vanned off the racetrack. \\"He gave us such a scare,\\" said O'Neill. \\"We thought he broke down. You wanted to hug the horse even more. He gave everything he had. People don't do that and horses don't do that.\\" Lava Man was sent east for the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in New York, where he finished over 45 lengths behind in seventh place, hampered by a sore left front hoof. In late November, he went to Japan for the Japan Cup Dirt where he finished eleventh, running without Lasix for the first time. At the start of the race, Lava Man stumbled and tore the sole of his hoof. \\"He bled for 1 1/2 miles. We thought it was the end of him, that he was done racing,\\" said Leandro Mora, O'Neill's assistant trainer. He finished the year with three wins from nine starts and was named the California-bred Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse. =2006= Lava Man's first race of 2006 was the $1,000,000 Sunshine Millions Classic at Santa Anita Park in California on January 28, restricted to California- and Florida- bred horses. Fitted with a special shoe to help with his sore feet, he returned to form with a length win. O'Neill was relieved. \\"If I wasn't connected to this horse, I would have said [he] had lost it,\\" the trainer said. \\"But he finally ran like he had been training.\\" In his next race, the $1,000,000 Grade 1 Santa Anita Handicap, Lava Man faced favorite High Limit, 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo, and 2004 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Champion Wilko. He scored a \\"spectacular\\" length victory over Magnum, who was getting 7 pounds. Because of his earlier turf form, O'Neill next entered him in the restricted Khaled Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Lava Man won easily and set a new track record of 1:44.26 for 1 miles. Keeping him on the turf, O'Neill followed up by entering the horse in the Grade 1 Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Lava Man won the mile race easily after getting an unchallenged early lead. This victory made him the first horse since Eclipse Award winner Vanlandingham in 1985 to win a Grade 1 Turf and Dirt race in the same year. Next up for Lava Man was an attempt to repeat in the Hollywood Gold Cup on July 8. Only California-bred Hall of Famer Native Diver had ever repeated in the Gold Cup, in 1965-66-67. Lava Man raced out of a detention barn because O'Neil had been penalized after another horse had an excess of total carbon dioxide in a post race drug test in May. Lava Man stumbled badly at the start of the race and settled farther off the pace than he generally preferred. Nevertheless, he took the lead in mid-stretch and won by a short nose over longshot Ace Blue, who was carrying 10 pounds fewer than Lava Man. Lava Man had now won the Gold Cup by both the biggest (in 2005) and smallest (in 2006) margins in the race history. Lava Man became the first horse since Triple Crown Winner Affirmed in 1979 to win the Santa Anita Handicap and Hollywood Gold Cup in the same year. He also became the first horse to win the Whittingham and the Gold Cup in the same year since Exceller in 1978. Lava Man earned his third straight Beyer Speed Figure of 108 in the race. Daily Racing Form columnist Dick Jerardi wrote, \\"[N]early 27 months after his first visit to Hollywood Park Racetrack[finishing last at 57-1 in the Snow Chief Stakes], Lava Man was 3-5 in the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup. This is about as close to Seabiscuit as this sport has seen since Seabiscuit.\\" Lava Man (with jockey Corey Nakatani) after crossing the finish line to take 1st place in the 2006 Goodwood Breeder's Cup Handicap. On August 26, Lava Man won the Grade 1 Pacific Classic Stakes over a strong field of equal-weighted thoroughbreds including Giacomo, Perfect Drift, Good Reward, Super Frolic, and Magnum. By virtue of this win, he became the first horse ever to take the Grade 1 Santa Anita Handicap, the Grade 1 Hollywood Gold Cup, and the Grade 1 Pacific Classic Stakes in the same calendar year. The feat has since been matched by Game On Dude in 2013 and Accelerate in 2018. \\"It's incredible when you think about all the great horsemen and great horses that have run in this state\\", said O'Neil. In October, Lava Man won his seventh straight race, the $500,000 Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap, while carrying 126 lbs., 10 more lbs. than runner-up Brother Derek. He was touted by many racing observers as a possible 2006 Horse of the Year candidate if he could beat favored Bernardini outside California in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in Kentucky on November 4. However, he was never a factor in the Classic, finishing seventh after a troubled trip, well behind Bernardini and the winner, Invasor, who came from Argentina by way of Uruguay and Dubai. \\"I'm a little disappointed with the result, but I'm proud of how he ran and how he tried,\\" said O'Neill. Despite his Breeders' Cup Classic loss, Lava Man's likeness was inserted into a snowglobe given to paid admissions at Hollywood Park Racetrack in December 2006. With seven wins (four of them Grade I) in eight starts, Lava Man was named the 2006 California-bred Horse of the Year, Champion older horse and Champion turf horse. He earned a 127 rating in the 2006 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings. =2007= Lava Man's first start of 2007 was the $500,000 Sunshine Millions Turf at Santa Anita Park on January 27. Racing wide most of the way, he pulled away in the stretch to win by two lengths. On March 3, Lava Man earned back-to-back victories in the Santa Anita Handicap, a feat previously only accomplished by John Henry and Milwaukee Brew. In this race, he carried the topweight of 124 pounds and beat Molengao, Boboman, and 2007 Sunshine Millions Classic winner McCann's Mojave in front of 43,024 fans. He became the only horse to win two Santa Anita Handicaps and two Hollywood Gold Cups. \\"These are the moments we all live and work for\\", said O'Neill. \\"He's truly a champion.\\" Three weeks after this win, he was shipped to Dubai to compete in the $5,000,000 Dubai Duty Free Stakes over approximately 1 miles on the turf. As was his characteristic when traveling outside of California, Lava Man did not fare well. He finished last of 16 horses after he had the lead 3 furlongs from the finish line. Lava Man's career record outside California was 5 losses in all 5 races and finishing off the board in each. On returning home, O'Neill said, \\"I think it's reasonable to say we won't be leaving California again... We'll let him tell us how he is through the feed tub and play it by ear.\\" Lava Man (with jockey Corey Nakatani) after dueling with A.P. Xcellent to win the 2007 Hollywood Gold Cup. On June 11, Lava Man returned to the California race circuit with a second-place finish in the Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap, won by After Market in the excellent time of 1:58.77, just off the course record. His connections were pleased at the result after the layoff, especially considering Lava Man six pounds more than the winner. On June 30, Lava Man won his third consecutive Hollywood Gold Cup, beating A.P. Xcellent by a nose after dueling down the stretch. Lava Man's third consecutive Gold Cup matched Native Diver's three-peat of 1965–1967 and set a new course record for 1 miles on the new Hollywood Park \\"Cushion Track\\" synthetic dirt surface. \\"He's done so much and every time he does it, you're like, 'Wow, that's crazy,' and then he does something more,\\" said co-owner Jason Wood. \\"So here we sit, three-peat of the Gold Cup.\\" With his win on cushion track, Lava Man became the first horse to win Grade 1 races on three different surfaces: conventional dirt, synthetic dirt and turf. After his Gold Cup win, Steve Haskin of the Blood-Horse contemplated Lava Man's failure to win outside of the state of California and called upon his owners to make another attempt at the Breeders' Cup. Haskin wrote: \\"Sure, it could backfire, but it’s not as if Lava Man’s reputation is going to suffer if it did. He’ll still be the king of California. He’ll still be a racing treasure. He’ll still be a legend. In short, he’ll still be Lava Man. And that’s enough in anyone’s lifetime.\\" On July 15, 2007, Lava Man was named \\"Horse of the Meet\\" for the Hollywood Park Spring/Summer Meet for the third consecutive year. On July 23, 2007, Lava Man's long-time groom, Noe Garcia, suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident just outside the Del Mar Racetrack, where Lava Man was stabled in preparation for the Pacific Classic Stakes. The accident left Garcia without his left arm. O'Neill said, \\"He's lucky to be alive and he's got a lot to live for. He's got a job with this stable forever.\\" Some of his connections felt that the absence of Garcia contributed to Lava Man's subsequent loss of form. \\"Horses have sensitivity, feelings, and heart. He could have been feeling the loss, and the change in routine,\\" said assistant trainer Mora. On August 19, Lava Man was sent-off as the 6-5 favorite in the Pacific Classic Stakes but did not take well to Del Mar's new Polytrack racing surface and finished a well-beaten sixth. He was then pointed to the October 7 Oak Tree Mile Stakes at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meet in hopes that the shorter distance and firmer turf might benefit him. The gelding placed sixth and last, and jockey Corey Nakatani said, \\"There was no energy level there at all. We were sitting in a real good spot right behind the leaders, and then I can normally push the horse outside, but he just had no fight today. I don't know what the deal was.\\" Lava Man then went off as the favorite in the California Cup Classic at Santa Anita Park on November 3. The gelding broke well and assumed a stalking position. However, in mid stretch he again ran out of steam and placed 6th. Veterinarians at Alamo Pintado Equine Medical Center in Santa Barbara, CA, were unable to identify anything physically wrong with the horse, and O'Neill sent Lava Man to NexStar farm in Temecula, CA, for a planned several-month vacation from racing. Lava Man was also featured in an hour-plus DVD Biography offered at Hollywood Park Racetrack in December 2007 as a fundraiser for Garcia. The biography was narrated by Jim Forbes of VH1 Behind the Music fame, and was later incorporated into the TVG Racing Network's biography series Legends. He was named Champion Older Horse by the CTBA. =Later career and retirements= Lava Man at NexStar farm in Temecula, CA. Lava Man was again examined at the Alamo Pintado Equine Medical Center before returning to Hollywood Park on January 26, 2008.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/43468/lava-man-back- for-2008-campaign O'Neill ran Lava Man at Khaled Stakes on April 28, where he finished third. Lava Man went on to run competitively in the $300,000 Charles Whittingham Handicap at Hollywood Park on June 7, 2008, placing third, a neck behind the winner. O'Neill deemed the three-week timetable between the Whittingham and the Hollywood Gold Cup to be too short of a rest for Lava Man to make an attempt to win the race for the fourth consecutive time. The horse then started in the Grade I Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack on July 20, 2008, finishing sixth. Subsequent x-rays, performed at the Alamo Pintado Equine Medical Center, revealed that the gelding's front ankles showed marked changes from x-rays taken earlier in the year. Based on the veterinarian's assessment and the gelding's performance in the Eddie Read, Lava Man was retired on July 30, 2008, after having made 46 starts. The original plan was to retire the horse to Old Friends Equine. However, Lava Man was restless away from the racetrack so was sent back to Alamo Pintado in hopes that his physical problems could be repaired sufficiently to allow him to be used as a riding horse. Dr. Doug Herthel used stem cell therapy, which proved so successful that his connections considered a return to the racetrack. On September 23, 2009, after Lava Man ran an official 3 furlong workout in 36 seconds flat at Hollywood Park (tied for the fastest time of the 24 horses that ran at that distance), O'Neill announced that the gelding was back in training and preparing for a comeback only if he could compete at a Grade 1 level. Lava Man's only comeback start was in the San Gabriel Handicap (Gr. IIT) at Santa Anita Park on December 27, 2009, where he finished last. It was announced on January 5, 2010, that Lava Man was retired for good. \\"He came out of the race sound and he is a strong and sturdy horse, but we don’t want to tarnish his reputation,\\" said Kenly. \\"It was his first race in a year and half and I’m sure he would improve in his next race, but I think he has lost a step. It was disappointing for all of us because he was training unbelievably.\\" In May 2010, O'Neill said that the horse was his stable pony and that he had become accustomed to his new role. On May 5, 2012, Lava Man served as lead pony for three-year-old colt I'll Have Another in the post parade for both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, races which I'll Have Another subsequently won. \\"He's great with the young horses and happy as he can be,\\" said O’Neill in 2015. \\"He's been a great asset for the team, taking the babies to and from the track.\\" Lava Man underwent colic surgery in July 2018. Legacy Lava Man won 7 Grade 1 races, ranking him as the all-time leader among California-breds. He scored nine triple digit Beyer Speed Figures during his career and set two course records. His earnings of nearly $5.2 million place him third on the list of leading California-bred earners, behind Best Pal ($5,668,245) and Tiznow ($6,427,830). He and Game on Dude are the only horses to win the signature race at each of Southern California's major thoroughbred racetracks in one year, and he equalled Native Diver's record of winning three consecutive Hollywood Gold Cups. Lava Man was the first horse in a generation to win a Grade 1 race on dirt and turf in the same year, and he is the only horse to win a North American Grade 1 race on dirt, turf, and an artificial racing surface. He is the all-time leading earner among claimers and is arguably the greatest claim in racing history. Lava Man made an appearance at the Thoroughbred Classic Horse Show held at the Rancho Mission Viejo Riding Park in order to demonstrate the versatility of retired racehorses. Handled by Sommer Smith of NexStar Ranch, he won all three classes in which he was entered – War Horse, War Horse Showmanship and Spirit of a Winner. On April 20, 2015, Lava Man's induction into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame was announced.

He is notable for having the Senate consider expelling him for corruption during his second term as a Senator. Early life Born on a farm near Little Compton, he attended a private school in Newport and moved to Providence in 1812. He was employed in various manufacturing concerns in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and engaged in the manufacture of yarn at Simmonsville (now Thornton), New Hampshire in 1822. He moved to Johnston, Rhode Island in 1827 and resumed the manufacture of yarns and engaged in agricultural pursuits; he was a member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives from 1828 to 1841. United States Senator Simmons was elected as a Whig to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1847. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Manufactures (Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Congresses) and a member of the Committee on Printing (Twenty-seventh and Twenty-eighth Congresses). Post- Senate career After running unsuccessfully for reelection in 1846, Simmons returned to Johnston and resumed his former pursuits. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Senate in 1850. Return to the U.S. Senate Simmons was again elected to the United States Senate in 1856 as a Republican and served from March 4, 1857, through the first year of the American Civil War. He was chairman of the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office during the Thirty- seventh Congress. On July 12, 1862, Senator Joseph A. Wright submitted a resolution calling for Simmons's expulsion. Wright stated that Secretary of War Edwin Stanton accused Simmons of securing a contract for two Rhode Island rifle manufacturers in exchange for a fee of $20,000 in promissory notes. Following these accusations, Congress passed a law barring members of Congress from accepting fees for services before agencies of the United States government. On July 14, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a report stating that it found Simmons' conduct \\"entirely inexcusable\\" but that charging Simmons would be an ex post facto violation of his rights, in that his conduct had occurred before the law prohibiting it was passed. The Committee recommended that the Senate do what it felt necessary. The Senate adjourned three days later, having taken no action in Simmons' case. Simmons resigned on September 5, 1862, before the Senate could return for its December session and again take up the question of expelling him. Later life After his resignation, Simmons resumed his former manufacturing pursuits. Death and burial Simmons died in Johnston in 1864. He was buried at North End Cemetery in Providence.

He is serving life in prison without parole at the Federal ADX Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. Overview On August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota by the FBI and charged with an immigration violation. He aroused suspicion while taking flight training courses in Eagan, Minnesota. On December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property. Moussaoui was alleged by federal prosecutors to have been a replacement for the \\"first\\" 20th hijacker, possibly Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin al-Shibh and Zakariyah Essabar were denied visas. However, prosecutors in Moussaoui's drawn-out trial in the US had difficulty directly connecting him to the 19 participants. Moussaoui's trial was seen in some circles as a barometer of the ability and willingness of the United States to give a fair hearing to terrorism suspects. Others objected to the degree to which the court and especially Judge Leonie Brinkema tolerated the bizarre and threatening courtroom behavior of Moussaoui. Moussaoui expressed contempt for the trial and court by introducing legal motions deriding Judge Brinkema, surprised onlookers by electing to represent himself in court, and rankled federal prosecutors by requesting the presence of captured al-Qaeda members as witnesses in his case. During the trial, Moussaoui initially stated that he was not involved in the September 11 attacks, but that he was planning an attack of his own. Some al-Qaeda members reportedly corroborated Moussaoui's statement to an extent, saying that he was involved in a plot other than September 11, but prosecutors believed that his story had no merit. On April 3, 2006, Moussaoui was found to be eligible for the death penalty. Before leaving the courtroom, he was reported to have shouted, \\"You will never get my blood. God curse you all!\\"Hirschkorn, Phil. Moussaoui eligible for death penalty. CNN (2006-04-05) Later that month he withdrew his qualifications and again admitted guilt on all charges levied by the prosecution. On May 3, 2006, a jury decided against the death penalty for Moussaoui. The next day, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. As he was led out of the courtroom, Moussaoui clapped his hands and said, \\"America, you lost ... I won.\\" Judge Brinkema responded by telling him that he would \\"die with a whimper\\" and \\"never get a chance to speak again.\\"Judge hits back in Moussaoui spat. BBC News (2006-04-04). According to the Associated Press, three jurors decided Moussaoui had only limited knowledge of the September 11 plot, and three described his role in the attacks as minor, if he had any role at all. Following sentencing, Moussaoui recanted his trial testimony stating he was not a member of the September 11, 2001, conspiracy, but \\"part of another al-Qaeda plot which was to occur after September 11.\\" Personal history =Childhood= Aicha el-Wafi, Moussaoui's mother, was 14 when she was married to a man that she did not previously know,The Independent, 8 September 2011, 'I Love My Son More Than Ever..' The 9/11 Terrorist's Mother Who Won't Give Up p, 26-27 in Morocco.Kennedy, Helen. Terrorist's mom gets hug. New York Daily News (2006-03-14). Five years later, Moussaoui's parents moved to France, where he was born. After enduring domestic violence, his mother left his father Omar while her four children were still young. She raised her children on a cleaner's wages. There was no religious education within the family. Witnesses testified at Moussaui's trial that, as first-generation immigrants from Morocco, the family frequently faced racism in their new country. From 1982, Moussaoui, his brother and sisters, were brought up in a bungalow on the edge of the town of Narbonne. His mother has said that she believes two 'wounding' incidents in his French adolescence contributed to the formation of an extremist sensibility: the first the day that his school careers adviser pushed him towards minor, technical studies, with \\"the clear implication that he was only an Arab and would need nothing more,\\" and the second the day that the father of his teenage sweetheart warned him off because he was an Arab. \\"Don't think that you will ever get your feet under my table,\\" the man said. \\"The Independent, 8 September 2011 According to his brother, Abd Samad Moussaoui, Zacarias loved to play handball:My Brother Zac.

He holds a master's degree in International Business from South Bank University in London, having enrolled in 1993 and graduated in 1995.Woodward, Will. Hijack suspect was South Bank student. The Guardian (2001-10-06). He attended, amongst others, the Brixton Mosque, where he may have met Richard Reid, the future shoe bomber. He was proselytised by groups such as al-Muhajiroun (\\"the Emigrants\\"), who leafleted people attending moderate mosques such as that in Brixton. It is possible that he had connections with members of the Finsbury Park mosque, where the extremist Abu Hamza al-Masri taught. French authorities began monitoring Moussaoui in 1996 when they observed him with Islamic extremists in London. In 1998, he attended the Khalden training camp in Afghanistan, allegedly returning the next year as well. In September 2000, he visited Malaysia and stayed in a condominium owned by Yazid Sufaat who, in October 2000, signed letters identifying Moussaoui as a representative of his company. Two of the September 11 hijackers lived in the same condominium in January 2000. Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Ismauddin sent cohort Yazid Sufaat to provide Moussaoui with $35,000 USD and travel documents in Malaysia in October. =Flight training= From February 26 to May 29, 2001, Moussaoui attended flight training courses at Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma. Despite 57 hours of flying lessons, he failed and left without ever having flown solo. This school was visited by Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted planes into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center. During his time in Norman, Moussaoui had a roommate named Hussein al-Attas. On August 11, 2001, Hussein al-Attas drove Moussaoui to Minnesota from Oklahoma. Hussein al-Attas said that he and Moussaoui planned to take a trip to New York City in late August/early September 2001. In 2002, al-Attas admitted that he lied to the FBI to conceal Moussaoui's name, lied to the inquisitive FBI to conceal Moussaoui's extremist jihadi and anti-American beliefs, lied to conceal his own tendencies, lied to conceal that Moussaoui had been trying to convince him to become more active in the jihad or struggle, and lied to conceal the names of other Middle Easterners who were taking flight lessons in Oklahoma. Moussaoui allegedly received US$14,000 in wire transfers from bin al-Shibh, originating from Düsseldorf and Hamburg, Germany, in early August. This money could have helped him pay for flight training about two weeks later at Pan-Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota. On August 13, Moussaoui paid US$6,800 with US$100 bills to receive training in a 747-400 simulator. The simulator that Pan-Am uses is operated by Northwest Aerospace Training Corporation (NATCO), a training facility affiliated with Northwest Airlines. Moussaoui was reportedly considered as a replacement for Ziad Jarrah, who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters. Plans to include Moussaoui were never completed because the al-Qaeda hierarchy allegedly had doubts about his reliability. Clarence Prevost, the flight instructor assigned to Moussaoui, began to have suspicions about his student. His behavior largely resembled that of other seemingly wealthy men who had come to the center in the past to receive jumbo jet training despite the fact that they would likely never use it, but some characteristics were unusual. Prevost said later that in pre-simulator instruction, Moussaoui would ask questions that had the right jargon but were otherwise nonsensical. Moussaoui read through the 747 training manuals, but had a lack of understanding of the plane's systems. Prevost was confused as to why Moussaoui would seek simulator time if he lacked basic plane knowledge. After some convincing, his supervisors contacted the FBI, who came to meet with him. (Despite later reports, Moussaoui did not skip the training for takeoff and landing).Flight instructor gets $5 million for catching terror suspect CNN (2008-01-25) =Capture= On August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested by Harry Samit of the FBI and INS agents in Minnesota and charged with an immigration violation. Materials itemized when he was arrested included a laptop computer, two knives, flight manuals pertaining to Boeing's 747 aircraft, a flight simulator computer program, fighting gloves and shin guards, and a computer disk with information about crop dusting. Some agents worried that his flight training had violent intentions, so the Minnesota bureau tried to get permission (sending over 70 emails in a week) to search his laptop, but they were turned down. FBI agent Coleen Rowley made an explicit request for permission to search Moussaoui's personal rooms. This request was first denied by her superior, Deputy General Counsel Marion \\"Spike\\" Bowman, and later rejected based upon FISA regulations (amended after 9/11 by the USA Patriot Act). Several further search attempts similarly failed. Ahmed Ressam, the captured al-Qaeda Millennium Bomber, was at the time sharing information with the US authorities, in an effort to gain leniency in his sentencing. One person whom he was not asked about until after 9/11, but whom he was able to identify when asked as having trained with him at al- Qaeda's Khalden Camp in Afghanistan, was Moussaoui. The 9/11 Commission Report opined that had Ressam been asked about Moussaoui, he would have broken the FBI's logjam. Had that happened, the Report opined, the U.S. might conceivably have disrupted or derailed the September 11 attacks altogether. Court proceedings On December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property.UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI - Indictment. United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia Alexandria Division, United States Department of Justice, December 2001. Retrieved on 2007-01-03. The indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui named as unindicted co-conspirators Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, among others, for their role in the attack \\"to murder thousands of innocent people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\\" On January 2, 2002, Moussaoui refused to enter any plea to the charges and so Judge Leonie Brinkema entered pleas of not guilty. A hearing was held on April 22, 2002, to determine his right to self-representation, for by then Moussaoui had declined the assistance of his court-appointed attorneys, and asked to defend himself. At another hearing on June 13, 2002, Brinkema deemed him competent to defend himself and allowed the case to move forward. However, Moussaoui later requested the occasional assistance of attorneys to help him with technical issues. Moussaoui admitted his involvement with al-Qaeda, but claimed he was not involved in the 9/11 attacks. Rather, he claimed that he was preparing for a separate attack. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had earlier told investigators that Moussaoui met with him prior to September 11, but that he, Mohammed, chose not to use him. No evidence directly linking Moussaoui to the 9/11 attacks has yet been released. The trial highlighted a tension in the United States between the judiciary and national security. Moussaoui made requests for access to confidential documents and the right to call captive al-Qaeda members as witnesses, notably bin al-Shibh, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Both requests were claimed by prosecutors to be potential threats to national security. Brinkema denied the motion to access confidential documents, although Moussaoui was permitted to use several al- Qaeda prisoners as witnesses. Brinkema put the death penalty \\"off limits\\" on October 2, 2003, in reply to government defiance of her order to provide access to Moussaoui's witnesses. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Brinkema ruling, holding that the U.S. government could use summaries of interviews/interrogations of these witnesses. On March 21, 2005, the United States Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear Moussaoui's pre-trial appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision, returning the case to Brinkema. On April 22, 2005, in one of the court sessions near the end of that phase of the proceedings, Moussaoui surprised the whole court by pleading guilty to all charges, while at the same time denying having any intention to produce a massacre like 9/11. He said that it was not his conspiracy, and that he intended to free Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman. According to Moussaoui, his master plan was to hijack a Boeing 747-400, since the plane is one of a few that could reach Afghanistan from the U.S. without any intermediate stops. On February 6, 2006, Moussaoui shouted \\"I am al-Qaeda. They do not represent me; they are Americans,\\" referring to his attorneys while being escorted from the courtroom in front of 120 potential jurors.Moussaoui: 'I am al Qaeda'. CNN (2006-02-06).

On March 27, 2006, Moussaoui testified that he and \\"shoe bomber\\" Richard Reid had planned to crash a hijacked airplane into the White House in the September 11 attacks. No direct connection between Moussaoui and Reid had ever before been alleged, and this testimony contradicted earlier testimony by Moussaoui that he had been intended for an operation after September 11.

Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, of the Saudi royal family were specifically mentioned as Al-Qaeda donors—but the project's major patrons was Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who in January 2015 became Saudi Arabia's king. Moussaoui's testimony provides new details of the extent and nature of that support in the pre-9/11 period. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema declared \\"Moussaoui is completely competent\\", called him \\"an extremely intelligent man\\" and added: \\"He has actually a better understanding of the legal system than some lawyers I've seen in court\\". The former Senators Bob Graham of Florida and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and the former Navy secretary John Lehman believe the Saudi role in the 9/11 plot has never been adequately examined and they demand the release of 28 pages of the congressional report that explored Saudi connections and remain classified. Both the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have refused to declassify the 28 pages on grounds of \\"national security\\", but as Graham argues the opposite is true the real \\"threat to national security is non-disclosure\\": The Saudis know what they did and the U.S. knows what they did, and when the U.S. government takes a position of passivity, or actively shuts down inquiry, that sends a message to the Saudis. \\"They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for the most extreme form of Islam known as Wahhabism\\" he stated, arguing that both al Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant are \\"a creation of Saudi Arabia.\\" On January 7, 2015, Graham, Congressmen Walter Jones and Stephen F. Lynch, and members of the 9/11 families including Terry Strada, national co-chair of the ″9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism″ held a press conference on Capitol Hill announcing the reintroduction of the resolution calling for the declassification of the 28 pages. Graham said that those pages \\"point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as the principal financier\\" of the 9/11 hijackers: \\"This may seem stale to some but it's as current as the headlines we see today,\\" referring to the terrorist attack on a satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris.Jason Burke: \\"Zacarias Moussaoui says al-Qaida was backed by Saudi Arabia. But can he be believed?\\" . The Guardian, February 4, 2015Eleanor Clift: \\"The Missing Pages of the 9/11 Report\\" , The Daily Beast, January 12, 2015 Reward On January 24, 2008, Clarence Prevost, the flight instructor who led authorities to Moussaoui, received a $5 million reward from the U.S. government. The payment was questioned by agent Coleen Rowley and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Norm Coleman, among others, on the basis that two other flight instructors had made the initial calls to the FBI.Dialing For Dollars , Newsweek, Jan 30, 2008 See also * Nick Berg * Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, believed to be a principal architect of the September 11 plot * Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh * Richard Reid * Mohamed Atta, supposed executive head of 9/11 terrorists, died in the attacks * Ramzi bin al-Shibh, roommate of Atta, imprisoned under similar conditions as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (believed to be in Guantanamo Bay) * Trials related to the September 11 attacks Notes References * Moussaoui, Abd Samad.

Biography  His first paintings were created in the 1980s. The paintings were inspired by the Pure Form Theory of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy) and entrenched in the tradition of 20th century European art. Beginning in 1985, J.A.R. showed in his paintings the social and political context associated with the criticism of Martial law in Poland (Dec. 1980). The contemplation of the different functions of this art led to the artist's formulation of the theory Art as Freedom (1985). Mostly inspired by Witkacy's grasp of the visible universe, in which the composition introduced the intended and directional tension, led Rossakiewicz to one interpretation of reality. The continuation of this philosophy led him in 1987 to the manifestation of social problems in his art. The next chapter of his art, The Everlasting Art, - 1989 was directly inspired from readings of the Old and New Testament. After 1989, Rossakiewicz started to create a series of evangelical paintings: Passion of Dunkirk and Saint John Passion. The Passion of Dunkirk is in the collection at the Modern Art Museum in Dunkirk, France. He died 24 September 2016. Rossakiewicz about his art: \\"In my understanding, to express man's spiritual life is to create art. The subject of the painting doesn’t matter. But the art has to originate in the inside, it has to be a result of man's life experiences. It cannot be simply planned; how to shock, how to draw attention to one's self, it cannot be done for money either. Because the spiritual and emotional state of an artist while painting, or working on a different work of art, is encoded in the painting and this energy is emanating from it.\\"  Saint John Passion  The cycle of 15 paintings (oil on canvas, 245x140 cm) with the prologue: The Transfiguration Image:Rossakiewicz_Last Supper.jpgThe Last Supper, 1989 (1), the classic composition was replaced by positioning the table vertically, which subconsciously suggested the shape of crucifix.

He was the lead guitarist for Aerosmith from 1979 until 1984. He co-wrote \\"Rock in a Hard Place\\" with Steven Tyler, and has performed or recorded with Rod Stewart, Billy Squier, Meat Loaf, Stevie Nicks, Robert Fleischman, Rough Cutt, Renegade, Flame and others. Early life and career James Crespo Jr. was born in Brooklyn and raised by Puerto Rican-American parents (Jaime and Carmen) within a musical family. He has one brother, John Crespo. Crespo first took up the guitar at age 14. He joined his first band, The Knomes, shortly afterward. During his teenage years he became an accomplished guitarist, influenced by the stylings of such artists as The Yardbirds, Cream, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. Forming the New York club band Anaconda, Crespo drew the attention of industry figures, leading to session work with a number of high-profile artists such as Meat Loaf and Stevie Nicks, before he was recruited as lead guitarist and songwriter by producer Jimmy Iovine for the RCA-signed band Flame, which was fronted by powerful lead vocalist Marge Raymond. Flame released two albums: \\"Queen of the Neighborhood\\" in 1977 and \\"Flame\\" in 1978. Aerosmith years Returning to session work following the breakup of Flame, Crespo attracted the attention of Aerosmith's management following the departure of Joe Perry from the band in 1979. Invited to audition for the vacant lead guitarist position, Crespo was asked to join Aerosmith in October 1979. Contributing a guitar solo to the song \\"3 Mile Smile\\" for the already recorded Night in the Ruts album, Crespo commenced touring with the band soon after joining. The tour was hampered by the increasingly erratic state of the band's singer, Steven Tyler, at this stage heavily beset by drug addiction and suffering several on-stage collapses. Drummer Joey Kramer formed a band called Renegade during this time, and he recruited Marge Raymond to sing lead and front the band. Jimmy Crespo, Tom Hamilton and the late Bob Mayo completed the line-up. An album was recorded at the Power Station in NYC and was produced by Tony Bongiovi, but it has never been released. Renegade is somewhat of a legend in the music industry and the tapes are much sought after by fans. Tyler, after realizing that Renegade was buzzing the industry and about to take off, came back to fulfill his contractual obligation to CBS. Renegade is referenced in several Aerosmith autobiographies. Despite the singer's troubles, including an incapacitating motorcycle accident in January 1981, Crespo and Tyler forged a songwriting and touring partnership. Crespo co-wrote six of the songs on Aerosmith's 1982 album Rock in a Hard Place with Tyler. Crespo performed most guitar duties on the album. Charting at number 37 on the US Billboard chart, Rock in a Hard Place reportedly cost over $1 million in production costs, featuring a plethora of production and engineering staff amongst its credits. Xavier Russell said of it in Sounds: \\"As soon as the needle hit the wax, it melted and the speaker covers blew across the living room floor - Five Stars\\". Subsequent tours from 1982 through to early 1984 saw Crespo team up with Rick Dufay, who filled in for the absent Brad Whitford. Commercial difficulties during pre-production of the band's next album coupled with singer Tyler's desire to reconvene with guitarist Perry saw Crespo exit the band in mid-1984, as the \\"classic\\" 1971–1979 Aerosmith lineup re-formed. Crespo went on to play guitar in the band Adam Bomb through the remainder of 1984 and into 1985. Post-Aerosmith Following his time in Aerosmith, Crespo ended up working at Home Depot as a cashier. Musically he also played on the final sessions of Stress and spent several years with Adam Bomb, a Geffen Records-signed band: his work with Stress was finally in the bonus tracks added to the CD reissue of Killing Me Night & Day on Deep Shag Records. Crespo contributed guitar to the Adam Bomb album Fatal Attraction (Geffen 1985) before settling in Los Angeles with new wife, Cynthia. Crespo joined bassist Danny Sheridan and Bonnie Bramlett in their new band Bandaloo Doctors from 1987 to 1992 and returned to session work as well as touring and recording with Billy Squier for several years. From 1994 to 1996, Crespo was part of Rod Stewart's live band as lead guitarist. Crespo was part of Paul Shortino's The Cutt (a revamped new formation of Shortino's Rough Cutt) who released the LP Sacred Place in 2002 before disbanding. Continuing to play as a studio musician, Crespo has also performed at some of Las Vegas' biggest casinos, whilst also engineering a rock amplifier simulator (\\"Rock Amp Legends by Jimmy Crespo\\") for Nomad Factory. He is working on a new album The Jimmy Crespo Project. Crespo performed with the HitMen All Stars featuring also former members of Boston, Dire Straits, Journey, Fleetwood Mac & Night Ranger. He also is part of The Rod Experience, a project with the drum legend Carmine Appice. There were also reported news of a solo project. 2015 saw the release of the unreleased collaboration with Jamie Borden and Tommy Paris titled JJT.

Early life Travilla was born and raised in Los Angeles. During adolescence, became interested in art and enrolled at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. When Travilla was sixteen, he began to frequent burlesque clubs in order to design the dancers' costumes. He sold pencil sketches of costume designs to the showgirls. After inheriting $5,000 from his grandfather, Travilla used the money to travel. He spent a year in the South Seas and Tahiti, an area which influenced his art work and designs. After being designated 4F due to flat feet, Travilla enrolled at Woodbury University where he studied fashion designing. He graduated in 1941. Career Upon graduating from Woodbury, Travilla began working at Western Costume in Hollywood as ghost-sketcher for studio designers. After a stint at Western, Travilla took a job designing at Jack’s of Hollywood. At Jack’s, he was given assignments working for ice skater and actress Sonja Henie as well as for United Artists and Columbia Pictures. Travilla began selling Tahiti-inspired paintings at the popular tiki bar Don The Beachcomber. Actress Ann Sheridan began collecting Travilla’s work and, shortly thereafter, requested that Warner Bros. hire Travilla as her personal costume designer. His designs for Sheridan were featured in the 1947 film noir Nora Prentiss. The film was a hit and Travilla was hired to design costumes for Sheridan in her next film, the 1948 Western Silver River. Design for Marilyn Monroe when she stands over the subway grating in The Seven Year Itch (1955). Design for Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), for song \\"Two Little Girls from Little Rock\\". After work on several B movies, Travilla worked his way upward through the studio until he earned an Oscar in 1949 for the Errol Flynn swashbuckler Adventures of Don Juan, and in 1951 designed the costumes in the now classic sci-fi tale of morality The Day the Earth Stood Still. He then worked mainly at Twentieth Century-Fox, where his credits included Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata!. By 1952, Travilla had begun working with Marilyn Monroe and created the costumes for Don't Bother to Knock and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. He went on to design the costumes for several more of her films. Travilla created one of the most famous costumes in all of film – the pleated ivory cocktail dress Monroe wore in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch. Monroe is wearing it while standing on a New York City Subway ventilation grate; the dress rises up around her as a train passes below ground. Photographs of this scene have become synonymous with Monroe herself. The iconic dress, which was later purchased by actress Debbie Reynolds, sold for $4,600,000 (USD) during a 2011 auction. Besides winning his first Oscar, Travilla was also nominated for the Academy Award for How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953, There's No Business Like Show Business in 1954 and The Stripper in 1963. In the late 1970s, Travilla began working mainly in television. One of his most widely seen latter-day projects was the TV mini- series The Thorn Birds in 1983. Travilla was nominated for Emmy awards seven times for his work on television. In 1980, he won the Emmy for \\"Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or a Special\\" for The Scarlett O'Hara War, and in 1985 he won the Primetime Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Costumes for a Series\\" for his work on the television show Dallas. Travilla also designed several evening gowns for Lena Horne in the 1980s. Personal life On August 19, 1944, Travilla married actress Dona Drake in Santa Monica, California. The couple had a daughter, Nia, in August 1951. Travilla and Drake separated in 1956 but remained legally married until Drake’s death in 1989. Death and legacy On November 2, 1990, Travilla died of lung cancer at Good Samaritan Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. An exhibition of the personal collection of William Travilla began a world tour in 2008. The show began in England, then came to Los Angeles and in 2009 to Palm Springs, California. The collection includes gowns worn by Marilyn Monroe, Dorothy Dandridge, Dionne Warwick, Whitney Houston, Faye Dunaway, Judy Garland, Sharon Tate, Jane Russell, Betty Grable, Lana Turner, Diahann Carroll, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Joanne Woodward, Barbara Stanwyck and many other women in film and television, as well as his Oscar, patterns, sewing room artifacts and numerous original watercolor renderings of his costume designs.The Travilla World Tour See also * Forever Marilyn – a gigantic statue of Marilyn in the white dress over the subway grate created by Seward Johnson  References  External links   Category:1920 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century American artists Category:20th-century American painters Category:American costume designers Category:American male artists Category:American male painters Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Best Costume Design Academy Award winners Category:California people in design Category:Chouinard Art Institute alumni Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Primetime Emmy Award winners Category:Woodbury University alumni ","title":"William Travilla"},{"id":"5043671","text":"Self-portrait of Casimir Markievicz.

From 1902 the couple lived in Dublin. He continued to be known as \\"Count Markievicz\\" (and Constance as \\"Countess Markievicz\\"), and in the 1911 census gave his occupation as \\"Count (Russian nobility)\\".1911 census return Stanislas later said in a letter that his father had not been a count. Artistic life Markievicz was part of the literary circle that centred on W. B. Yeats and the Abbey Theatre. In 1910 he formed his own theatre company, the Independent Dramatic Company, which staged plays written by himself and starring his wife, Constance. Return to Ukraine In 1913 Markievicz moved to present-day Ukraine, and never returned to live in Ireland. However, he did correspond with his wife in Dublin and he was by her side when she died in 1927. Towards the end of his life Markievicz was active in Warsaw, as well as a correspondent for English magazines, such as the Londoner Daily News. He also wrote the screenplay of a 1920 Polish film, Powrót, directed by Aleksander Hertz.. His paintings included portraits, landscapes, and genre painting. The largest part of his art collection is held in Dublin, some remain in Poland (National Museum, Kraków and in private collections). His talent lent itself particularly to the large oil portraits of Polish statesmen Piłsudski and Wojciechowski. A catalogue for his works is still pending. He died in Warsaw, Poland, in 1932.

Setting =Overview= Characters reside in the world of the dual world of Kaïnas and Naakinis, a 30,000 mile disk lit by a sun-like orb called the Pendulum. This disk is surrounded by the Sofe, a 40-mile-tall wall of black ether that few, if any, have ever returned from. Kaïnas (the rational world) and Naakinis (the mythic world) exist with overlapping topography and ecosystems. Flora and fauna of Kainas are scaled normally by real-world standards, while Naakinis exists on a much larger scale (such as the \\"Kioux\\" trees that reach many miles in height). In general, the word \\"Kaïnas\\" denotes the disk illuminated by the Pendulum, but \\"Naakinis\\" extends further and includes whatever lies in and beyond the Sofe. =Dream, Aran, & Reality= The Pendulum spends roughly ten of each day's thirty hours beyond the Sofe, creating night-like darkness. During this time, a phenomenon called \\"The Dream\\" manifests, becoming stronger as less and less light permeates Kaïnas. The Dream is a fabulous and dangerous world that overlaps with reality. It is initially hazy and hallucinatory, becoming as solid as reality during the darkest parts of the night. Areas where the Pendulum does not shine are affected by permanent manifestations of the Dream. The Aran world is a separate existence, accessible only in places the Pendulums' light cannot reach (underground or deep underwater). It is fiercely primordial, rejecting inorganic matter and operating by rules entirely different from reality. The creatures inhabiting Aran are unpredictable and poorly understood. =Orpee & Eflow= The vast majority of the setting's population depends on the weekly consumption of the orpee fruit to survive. Without orpee, a rapid and excruciating death is guaranteed. Orpee naturally concentrates a life-force called \\"eflow\\" that fuels life. The politics and economics of Kaïnas are primarily driven by the collection and distribution of orpee, as it is an absolute requirement for life. =Races of Kainas= Ten races can be found in Kaïnas. * Emovan: Aquatic craftsmen with a strongly collectivist society. * Frilin: An intellectual plant-based race who do not require orpee to survive. * Gnath: A highly rational people who are the driving force behind modernization. * Inaïs: The only race able to harvest orpee, who live as passionate ascetics. * Nayan: A deeply passionate and charismatic race driven by a powerful martyrdom complex. * Odwoane: A diminutive race of mimicking laborers who instinctively gather and act in groups. * Solek: A race that emerged from the Sofe, characterized by their silence and efficiency * Volkoï: A race bred for war and physically dependent on a constant flow of adrenaline. * Yaki: A collection of tightly-knit nomadic tribes with a strong understanding of the Dream. * Zïn: Extremely rare, solitary beings who carry within them a volatile Aran entity. =Echoes= The heroes of Kaïnas are called Echoes. Able to harness eflow to produce miraculous effect using their \\"Gifts,\\" they are also able to gain information and insight through a \\"Whisper,\\" the so-called voice of eflow that speaks to each Echo. There exist many different \\"vocations\\" for Echoes, castes that delineate their personalities and abilities: * Awakener: Healers and animators of the inanimate. * Guardians: Marksmen and defenders. * Judge: Champions of social order and fair justice. * Judicator: Brutal warriors who police other Echoes. * Mind Chemist: Psychics able to enter the minds of others. * Nightmare: Violent predators who become one with the Dream. * Overlord: Overseers who seek and succeed at control over others. * Truth Crafter: Scholars and storytellers with the power of illusion. * Walker: Hardened drifters and explorers. * War Engine: Masters of all things martial.

Fulton played, coached, selected for and has commentated on the game with great success at the highest levels and has been named amongst Australia's greatest rugby league players of the 20th century. As a player Fulton won three premierships with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the 1970s, the last as captain. He represented for the Australian national side on thirty-five occasions, seven times as captain. He had a long coaching career at the first grade level, taking Manly to premiership victory in 1987 and 1996. He coached the Australian national team to thirty-nine Tests and World Cup games. He was a New South Wales State selector and a national selector. He is currently a radio commentator with 2GB. In 1985 he was selected as one of the initial four post-war \\"Immortals\\" of the Australian game and in 2008 he was named in Australia's team of the century. Background Fulton was born in Stockton Heath, Warrington, Cheshire, England and moved to Australia with his family when he was four years old. Playing career At seventeen years of age Fulton made his senior football début in the Illawarra Rugby League with Western Suburbs in 1965 and went on to represent for Country Seconds. =Manly-Warringah= Fulton was signed to Sydney's Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles by club secretary Ken Arthurson after being spotted by John Hobbs (Manly talent scout) and started his NSWRFL first grade career in 1966 aged eighteen. As a or Fulton made an immediate impact. He earned State representative honours in 1967 and the following year became the youngest ever captain in Grand Final history when he led Manly in the 1968 decider against Souths. Fulton made 219 appearances for the Manly club between 1966 and 1976.

Fulton won premierships with Manly in 1972 (also the League's top try-scorer this season), 1973 and 1976. In the 1973 bloodbath against Cronulla he single-handedly took control of the game scoring two tries to take the side to victory. At the end of the 1976 season Fulton caused a sensation in Sydney rugby league circles when he left Manly and signed a 3-year deal with the Eastern Suburbs club. He left Manly holding the club record for most tries. =Warrington= Following the 1969 NSWRFL season, Fulton accepted an offer to play a season with his 'home town' club Warrington in the 1969–70 English season. Fulton played 16 games for Warrington, scoring 16 tries and kicking 1 field goal before returning to Australia and Manly for the 1970 season. =Eastern Suburbs= Fulton played 56 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club, mainly at . In his first season there Fulton was a member of the side that won the pre-season cup and was the club's leading try scorer. In 1978 he was a member of the Easts side that defeated St George in the mid-week cup final. In 1979, Fulton was appointed captain-coach at the Roosters.

He toured New Zealand in 1971, was on the 1973 and 1978 Kangaroo Tours, played in home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1970 and 1974 and the home series against New Zealand in 1972 and 1978. He participated in Australian squads at four World cups – 1968, 1970 (including Australia's 12–7 World Cup Final win over Great Britain at Headingley), 1972 (including Australia's 10–all draw Great Britain in the World Cup Final in Lyon, France, though the Lions would win the tournament as they had finished on top of the ladder) and 1975 (won by Australia). He was named as the World Cup Man of the Series in 1970. The same knee injury that would eventually force his retirement as a player in 1979 would keep him from Australia's winning 1977 Rugby League World Cup squad. He was honoured with the Australian captaincy in the 2nd and 3rd Tests of the 1978 series against New Zealand and in all five Tests of the 1978 Kangaroo Tour, though that included the 2–0 series loss to France at the end of the tour, the last time Australia would lose a series or tournament until the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations.

He returned to Manly as coach in 1983 and in that same year took them to a Grand Final against Parramatta where the club was unsuccessful for the second year running. In 1987 he guided the Paul Vautin captained Sea Eagles side to a premiership victory over the Canberra Raiders in the last Grand Final played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, becoming in the process the first person at Manly to win premierships both as captain and as coach. Following the grand final victory he travelled with Manly to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against their champions, Wigan, though the Sea Eagles were beaten in a tryless game 8-2. From 1989 Fulton took on the job as coach of the Australian national side. He guided the side in 39 Tests between 1989 and 1998 to 32 victories, 1 draw and 6 losses. the successful 1990 and 1994 Kangaroo tours, as well as winning both the 1992 and 1995 World Cup Finals.

He was effectively exempted from active service by being posted to Sydney-based 5RAR, which had recently returned from Vietnam, thereby enabling him to pursue his professional football career while technically fulfilling his national service obligation. Accolades In 1985 he was selected by the publication Rugby League Week as one of the initial four post-war \\"Immortals\\" of the Australian game alongside Churchill, Raper and Gasnier.

The mosque is believed to be built by the Wali Songo (\\"Nine Muslim Saints\\") with the most prominent figure Sunan Kalijaga, during the first Demak Sultanate ruler, Raden Patah during the 15th century.  Features  Although it has had a number of renovations, it is thought to be largely in its original form. It is a classic example of a traditional Javanese mosque. Unlike mosques in the Middle East it is built from timber. Rather than a dome, which did not appear on Indonesian mosques until the 19th century, the roof is tiered and supported by four saka guru teak pillars. The tiered roof shows many similarities with wooden religious structures from the Hindu-Buddhist civilizations of Java and Bali. The main entrance of Masjid Agung Demak consists of two doors carved with motifs of plants, vases, crowns and an animal head with an open wide- toothed mouth. It is said that picture depicts the manifested thunder caught by Ki Ageng Selo, hence their name Lawang Bledheg (the doors of thunder).

Up until its abolition, it made plans based on evidence for the state’s cities and regions, working with the community, business and local government to create places for people in NSW to live, work and spend their leisure time, while ensuring good access to transport and other services like shops and restaurants. The Department was also responsible for the evidence-based assessment of state significant development applications. In 2015-16 the Department approved major projects worth 20 billion. Following the 2019 state election the department was abolished and most of its functions were merged with the Department of Industry to form the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, with effect from 1 July 2019. Both the Department of Industry and the Department of Planning and Environment were abolished on the same day. Structure The Department was the lead agency in the Planning and Environment cluster, at the time of its abolition led by Secretary, Carolyn McNally. =Ministers= The cluster's portfolio ministers were the Minister for Planning, the Minister for Housing, and the Special Minister of State, Anthony Roberts and the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Heritage, and the Minister for Local Government, Gabrielle Upton. Ultimately the ministers were responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales. The Department administered the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (1979). Priorities The Department's corporate plan was outlined in Planning for Growing NSW: 2015-2017 that aimed to plan for growth by inspiring strong communities and by protecting the environment. In keeping with this, the Department’s priorities were: * Enabling the creation of strong, vibrant communities * Make the planning system simpler, cheaper and faster * Supporting affordable and appropriately-serviced housing and employment land * Assessing major projects and infrastructure in a timely and efficient way, while ensuring appropriate planning outcomes History The main planning department/authority in New South Wales had various names throughout its history.

A kit-cat portrait or kit-kat portrait is a particular size of portrait, less than half-length, but including the hands. The name originates from a famous series of portraits which were commissioned from Godfrey Kneller for members of the Kit-Cat Club, a Whig dining club, to be hung in their meeting place at Barn Elms. They are now mostly in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London, with a selection of about twelve displayed in London and others at their satellite locations, including twenty on display at Beningbrough Hall in North Yorkshire. Size Each canvas is thirty-six inches long, and twenty-eight wide.Malone wrote in Dryden 534 (1800) The special Kit-cat portrait size is said to have been determined because the dining-room ceiling of the Kit-cat Club was too low for half- length portraits of the members. Slightly larger than the traditional head and shoulders format, it allows enough space to include one or both hands. So, while the poses in the Kit-cat portraits may look similar, none is actually repeated. When hung together, the overall effect is of a unified club of equals, though each man retains his individuality through distinct gestures, props and costumes.  Types  The Kit Kat portraits, as a whole, can be broken down into three separate types. The first group may be represented by the portrait of John Vanbrugh. Vanbrugh's portrait is the most famous and the style of the painting is the most common. Subjects wear huge stately wigs and formal clothing. The men painted in this style often look down and off to the left of the view, if to be day-dreaming or thinking of some grand political scheme. These men are also painted with a ring or pendant, depicting their family crest. William Cavendish represents the second most popular pose in the series. He is painted with the same stately wig and fine clothing but he holds his staff of office as Lord Steward. His face is also more ruddy than Vanbrugh's, suggesting that he may be younger.

It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web. It is also one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, . It features exclusively free content and has no advertising. It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, and was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of the terms \\"wiki\\" and \\"encyclopedia\\". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed. With million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than million articles attracting 1.5billion unique visitors per month. In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica, although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.Reagle, pp. 165–166. The following year, Time stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales. Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and exhibiting systemic bias. Wikipedia has also been criticized for gender bias, where the dominant majority of editors are male. However, edit-a- thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. The project's reputation improved significantly in the 2010s as it made efforts to improve its quality and reliability. Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.  History  = Nupedia = Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called Nupedia Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia, but none were as successful. Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.Kock, N., Jung, Y., & Syn, T. (2016). Wikipedia and e-Collaboration Research: Opportunities and Challenges. (PDF) International Journal of e-Collaboration (IJeC), 12(2), 1–8. It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \\"feeder\\" project for Nupedia. = Launch and early growth = The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001 and January 13, 2001 respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Wikipedia's policy of \\"neutral point- of-view\\" was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia. Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit. The Wikipedia Page on December 17, 2001 Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a total of 161 by the end of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years. Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org. Brion Vibber applied the change on August 15, 2002.https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2002-August/003982.html Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \\"low-hanging fruit\\"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.Austin Gibbons, David Vetrano, Susan Biancani (2012). Wikipedia: Nowhere to grow A promotional video of the Wikimedia Foundation that encourages viewers to edit Wikipedia, mostly reviewing 2014 via Wikipedia content In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.Volunteers Log Off as Wikipedia Ages, The Wall Street Journal, November 27, 2009. Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study. Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from \\"a little more than 36,000 writers\\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was \\"stable and sustainable\\". A 2013 article titled \\"The Decline of Wikipedia\\" in MIT's Technology Review questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae. In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline. In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated \\"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis\\".Ward, Katherine. New York Magazine, issue of November 25, 2013, p. 18. = Milestones = Map is showing how many articles of each European language there were as of January 2019. One square represents 1000 articles. Languages with less than 1000 articles are represented with one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color. In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors. , Wikipedia has rank 13 among websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet. In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month. On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \\"according to the ratings firm comScore\\". Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements piecemeal through \\"stigmergic accumulation\\". SOPA on January 18, 2012 On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours. More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced Wikipedia content. On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \\"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\\" Varma added that, \\"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\\" When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \\"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\\" By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally. In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, a portion of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia, 106 books for $500,000 . In 2019, a species of flowering plant was named Viola wikipedia. In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA.  Openness  Differences between versions of an article are highlighted Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principleThe procrastination principle dictates that you should wait for problems to arise before solving them. regarding the security of its content. It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text. = Restrictions = Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly controversial, sensitive or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to some degree. A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to modify it.English Wikipedia's protection policy A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes. In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \\"stable versions\\" of articles, which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \\"pending changes\\" system in December 2012. Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. The editing interface of Wikipedia = Review of changes = Although changes are not systematically reviewed, the software that powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. The \\"History\\" page of each article links to each revision.Revisions with libelous content, criminal threats, or copyright infringements may be removed completely. On most articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a \\"watchlist\\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of any changes. \\"New pages patrol\\" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.Wikipedia:New pages patrol In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor \\"creative construction\\" over \\"creative destruction\\".Andrea Ciffolilli, \\"Phantom authority, self- selective recruitment, and retention of members in virtual communities: The case of Wikipedia\\" , First Monday December 2003. = Vandalism = Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam. Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively. American journalist John Seigenthaler (1927–2014), subject of the Seigenthaler incident. Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes. However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair. In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The article remained uncorrected for four months. Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \\"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\\". This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of . = Edit warring = Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as \\"edit warring\\". The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added. This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive, conflict based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles, which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia. Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.  Policies and laws  Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the and in numerous intended to appropriately shape content. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines. Editors can by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. = Content policies and guidelines = According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.. Retrieved April 1, 2010. \\"Wikipedia is not a dictionary, usage, or jargon guide.\\" A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \\"notability\\",. Retrieved February 13, 2008. \\"A topic is presumed to be notable if it has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject.\\" which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized. It must not present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \\"verifiability, not truth\\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.. February 13, 2008. \\"Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source.\\" This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced. Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).  Governance  Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. = Administrators = Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with \\"administrator\\", privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing. Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision- making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism). Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous. Bureaucrats name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community. = Dispute resolution = Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,See for example the Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard or Neutral Point of View Noticeboard, created to address content falling under their respective areas. or seek outside input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a \\"request for comment\\".  Arbitration Committee  The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.  Community  Wikimania 2005—an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the Wikimedia Foundation, was held in Frankfurt am Main, Germany August 4–8. Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated \\"Talk\\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. Wikipedians and British Museum curators collaborate on the article Hoxne Hoard in June 2010 Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike, although not always with entirely negative connotations. The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as \\"anti-elitism\\". Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. As Wikipedia grew, \\"Who writes Wikipedia?\\" became one of the questions frequently asked on the project. Jimmy Wales once argued that only \\"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \\"much like any traditional organization\\". In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: \\"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\\" This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. The English Wikipedia has articles, registered editors, and active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days. Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \\"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\\". Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia, as \\"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\\", but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty. = Studies = A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \\"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\\". Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \\"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\\" However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \\"outsiders\\", while most editing and formatting is done by \\"insiders\\". A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. According to a 2009 study, there is \\"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\\". = Diversity = Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \\"ugly, intimidating behavior\\".Dimitra Kessenides (December 26, 2017). Bloomberg News Weekly, \\"Is Wikipedia 'Woke'\\". p. 73. Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.  Language editions  There are currently 313 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of , the six largest, in order of article count, are the , , , , , and Wikipedias. The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines. In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Waray, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Egyptian Arabic, Arabic, Portuguese and Ukrainian), six more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Serbian, Indonesian, Norwegian Bokmål and Korean), 43 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.List of Wikipedias The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over million articles. , according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 57% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Chinese: 6%; Japanese: 6%; Spanish: 5%). A graph for pageviews of Turkish Wikipedia shows a large drop of roughly 80% immediately after the block of Wikipedia in Turkey was imposed in 2017. Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color) or points of view. Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \\"neutral point of view\\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use. Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \\"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\\".Jimmy Wales, \\"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia\\", March 8, 2005, <Wikipedia-l@wikimedia.org> Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects. Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \\"interwiki links\\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. A study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia. = English Wikipedia editor decline = On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled \\"The Future of Wikipedia\\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia stating that \\"[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\\" The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014. Should this attrition have continued unabated at the quoted trend rate of approximately 20,000 editors lost within seven years, by 2021 there would be only 10,000 active editors on English Wikipedia. In contrast, the trend analysis published in The Economist presents Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non- English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.Andrew Lih. Wikipedia. Alternative edit policies at Wikipedia in other languages.  Reception  Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words .D. Jemielniak, Common Knowledge, Stanford University Press, 2014. Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \\"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\\".Black, Edwin (April 19, 2010) Wikipedia—The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge , History News Network Retrieved October 21, 2014 Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.Messer-Kruse, Timothy (February 12, 2012) The 'Undue Weight' of Truth on Wikipedia The Chronicle of Higher Education Retrieved March 27, 2014Colón-Aguirre, Monica & Fleming-May, Rachel A.

More like dumbness of the crowds  Oliver Kamm—Times Online (archive version 2011-08-14) (Author's own copy ) A 2008 article in Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.J. Petrilli, Michael (Spring 2008/Vol. 8, No. 2) Wikipedia or Wickedpedia? , Education Next Retrieved October 22, 2014 In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia. = Accuracy of content = Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \\"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.\\" Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \\"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\\" in science articles, \\"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\\" Others raised similar critiques. The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica, and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica. In addition to the point-for- point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a \\"flawed study design\\" (in Natures manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study \\"statistical power\\" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4× 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).See author acknowledged comments in response to the citation of the Nature study, at PLoS ONE, 2014, \\"Citation of fundamentally flawed Nature quality 'study' \\", In response to T. Yasseri et al. (2012) Dynamics of Conflicts in Wikipedia, Published June 20, 2012, , see , accessed July 21, 2014. As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \\"makes no guarantee of validity\\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information, vandalism, and similar problems. Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: \\"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \\"fake news\\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles. Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. The article stated that: \\"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia. These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report. A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \\"general source\\" that \\"can be a real boon\\" in \\"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\\" and, \\"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\\". = Discouragement in education = Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources; some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \\"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia,\\" he said.\\"Jimmy Wales\\", Biography Resource Center Online. (Gale, 2006.) In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.Child, Maxwell L., \\"Professors Split on Wiki Debate\\" , The Harvard Crimson, February 26, 2007. In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \\"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\\". In contrast, academic writing in Wikipedia has evolved in recent years and has been found to increase student interest, personal connection to the product, creativity in material processing, and international collaboration in the learning process.  Medical information  On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled \\"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\\", stated that \\"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\\"Julie Beck. \\"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\\". The Atlantic, March 5, 2014. Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled \\"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \\"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\\" Beck added that: \\"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\\" = Quality of writing = In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit coordination. For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its \\"clear and engaging prose\\", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing. Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised \\"McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words.\\" By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds \\"both verbose and dull\\". Rosenzweig also criticized the \\"waffling—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history\\". While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of such \\"waffling\\", which then stated: \\"Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero.\\" Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, \\"Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 percent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage.\\" A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the \\"start\\" class or \\"stub\\" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that \\"Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing\\". The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: \\"inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information\\". = Coverage of topics and systemic bias = Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism). Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China and Pakistan, amongst other countries. Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008 A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: * Culture and the arts: 30% (210%) * Biographies and persons: 15% (97%) * Geography and places: 14% (52%) * Society and social sciences: 12% (83%) * History and events: 11% (143%) * Natural and physical sciences: 9% (213%) * Technology and the applied sciences: 4% (−6%) * Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%) * Health: 2% (42%) * Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%) * Thought and philosophy: 1% (160%) These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its \\"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males focus more on Geography and Science.  Coverage of topics and selection bias  Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is most underrepresented.Mark Graham, Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content, Zerogeography.net (November 12, 2009). Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.The Guardian 2014 (London) The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.  Systemic bias  When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \\"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\\". The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \\"The Decline of Wikipedia\\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors. Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities or majority religions. It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to being young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may include over- emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.\\"Edit Wars Reveal the 10 Most Controversial Topics on Wikipedia\\", MIT Technology Review, July 17, 2013. His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \\"undo\\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting \\"reverting/reverted pairs\\" or \\"mutually reverting edit pairs\\". Such a \\"mutually reverting edit pair\\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \\"mutually reverting edit pairs\\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism, and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories. Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. = Explicit content = Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as Feces, Cadaver, Human penis, Vulva, and Nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children. The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children. The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \\"blacklist\\" it supplies to British internet service providers. In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law. Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \\"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\\", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have \\"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\\" Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \\"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\\". Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. = Privacy = One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \\"private citizen\\" rather than a \\"public figure\\" in the eyes of the law.Andrew McStay, 2014, Privacy and Philosophy: New Media and Affective Protocol , New York Peter Lang.See \\"Libel\\" by David McHam for the legal distinction. It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life (\\"meatspace\\"). A particular problem occurs in the case of a relatively unimportant individual and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes. In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka \\"Tron\\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.Heise —, by Torsten Kleinz, February 9, 2006. Wikipedia has a \\"\\" that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. = Sexism = Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment. The perceived toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia editors. In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her proposal referred to by a male editor using the words \\"the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one\\".  Operation  = Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia movement affiliates = alt=Katherine Maher in 2016. She is seen with light skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes. She is seen wearing a black shirt. Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks. The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million. In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \\"Information, like air, wants to be free.\\"Jeff Elder, The Wall Street Journal, May 1, 2014, \\"Wikipedia's New Chief: From Soviet Union to World's Sixth-Largest Site\\". The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \\"said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities,\\" Walsh said. Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \\"superprotection\\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.Dimitra Kessenides. Bloomberg News Weekly. December 26, 2016. \\"Is Wikipedia 'Woke'\\". Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the harassment issue that: \\"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority... (and that correction requires that) it has to be more than words.\\"Dimitra Kessenides. Bloomberg News Weekly. December 26, 2016, p. 74. \\"Is Wikipedia 'Woke'\\". Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia. = Software operations and support = The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom- made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third- generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker. Several MediaWiki extensions are installed. Retrieved August 18, 2014. to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene extension was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3. In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use. It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \\"slow and buggy\\". The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward. = Automated editing = Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. One controversial contributor creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.Aljazeera, July 21, 2014, \\"MH17 Wikipedia entry edited from Russian Government IP Address\\". Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.Andrew Lih (2009). The Wikipedia Revolution, chapter Then came the Bots, pp. 99–106. = Hardware operations and support = Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day.\\"Monthly request statistics\\", Wikimedia. Retrieved October 31, 2008. , page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers. Further statistics, based on a publicly available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. Overview of system architecture Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu). , there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam. By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia. in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia. = Internal research and operational development = Following growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.Frederic M. Scherer and David Ross, [1970] 1990. Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance, 3rd ed. Houghton-Mifflin. and 1st ed. review extract. • Google Scholar search of Frederic M. Scherer Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized \\"Thank\\" tab which were developed to ameliorate issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.Patents, Citations, and Innovations, by Adam B. Jaffe, Manuel Trajtenberg, pp. 89–153. At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. In 2016, the level of contributions were reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually. = Internal news publications = Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees. It covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia Commons. Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia. Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the Wikiworld webcomic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also several publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education.  Access to content  = Content licensing = When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. = Methods of access = Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re- distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website. * Websites: Thousands of \\"mirror sites\\" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. * Mobile apps: A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on hand-held devices, including both Android and iOS devices (see Wikipedia apps). (See also Mobile access.) * Search engines: Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Bing (via technology gained from Powerset) and DuckDuckGo. * Compact discs, DVDs: Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles.\\"Wikipedia on DVD\\" Linterweb. Retrieved June 1, 2007. \\"Linterweb is authorized to make a commercial use of the Wikipedia trademark restricted to the selling of the Encyclopedia CDs and DVDs\\".\\"Wikipedia 0.5 Available on a CD-ROM\\" Wikipedia on DVD. Linterweb. \\"The DVD or CD-ROM version 0.5 was commercially available for purchase.\\" Retrieved June 1, 2007. The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles. There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well. Also, \\"Wikipedia for Schools\\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and SOS Children, is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the UK National Curriculum and intended to be useful for much of the English- speaking world. The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes. * Printed books: There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM. * Semantic Web: The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English- language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in a queriable semantic format, RDF. This is still under development. As of February 2014 it has 15,000,000 items and 1,000 properties for describing them. Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged. Wikipedia publishes \\"dumps\\" of its contents, but these are text- only; there was no dump available of Wikipedia's images.Data dumps: Downloading Images, Wikimedia Meta-Wiki Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.  Mobile access  The mobile version of the English Wikipedia's main page, from August 3, 2019 Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \\"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English- language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\\" The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned \\"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \\"worry\\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.Brad Stone, \\"How Google's Android chief, Sundar Pichai, became the most powerful man in mobile\\", June 30July 6, 2014, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, pp. 47–51. At the time of the Tretikov appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. The latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. The latest version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS- based devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See ), such as geoinformation. Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries. It was discontinued in February 2018. Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. The number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.  Cultural impact  = Trusted source to combat fake news = In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, \\"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.\\" In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?' Alexa records the daily pageviews per visitor as 3.04 and the daily time on site as 4.01 minutes. = Readership = In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \\"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\\" However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, a good portion of which is related to academic research. The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements. According to \\"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.  COVID-19 pandemic  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. = Cultural significance = Wikipedia Monument in Słubice, Poland (2014, by Mihran Hakobyan) Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the \\"related links\\" section of its \\"further reading\\" list for the Civil Marriage Act. The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia., San Antonio Express-News, January 9, 2007. In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide. In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one of a select group of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation. On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \\"the seventh most consulted website\\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. Wikipedia, an introduction—Erasmus Prize 2015 Jimmy Wales accepts the 2008 Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award on behalf of Wikipedia On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: \\"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\\" An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \\"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an uninitiated audience. A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia \\"the best-known example of crowdsourcing... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\\" In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \\"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \\"since colonized the web for television's values\\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \\"endangered\\" due to the \\"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\\". Rather than \\"\\" (), social networks have led to a culture of \\"[d]are not to care to know\\". This is while Wikipedia faces \\"a more concerning problem\\" than funding, namely \\"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \\"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\\"  Awards  Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004.\\"Trophy box\\", (March 28, 2005). The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the \\"community\\" category. Wikipedia was also nominated for a \\"Best Practices\\" Webby award. In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \\"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\\" In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger. In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation. Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian language Wikipedia users. The night of the ceremony, members of the Wikimedia Foundation held a meeting with Wikipedians from all parts of Spain, including the local Asturian community.  Satire  Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles. Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning \\"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\\". Another example can be found in \\"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\\", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion, as well as the 2010 The Onion article \\"'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\\". In an episode of the television comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. \\"My Number One Doctor\\", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.Bakken, Janae. \\"My Number One Doctor\\"; Scrubs; ABC; December 6, 2007. In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named \\"Professor Wikipedia\\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \\"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\\" In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \\"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\\" The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier and a trans woman. In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \\"at least a dozen times a day\\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \\"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place or thing that it has left uncovered, and that he could never have written his last two books without it. = Sister projects—Wikimedia = Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002, Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched. = Publishing = A group of Wikimedians of the Wikimedia DC chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the Encyclopædia Britannica (back left) at the US National Archives The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, \\"The amorality of Web 2.0\\", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \\"free trumps quality all the time\\". Carr wrote: \\"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\\" Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the \\"wisdom of crowds\\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process. There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the biography publishing business. \\"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\\" said Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last Victorian. = Research use = Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \\"wikification\\",Rada Mihalcea and Andras Csomai (2007). Wikify! Linking Documents to Encyclopedic Knowledge Proc. CIKM. and to the related problem of word sense disambiguation.David Milne and Ian H. Witten (2008). Learning to link with Wikipedia. Proc. CIKM. Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \\"missing\\" links in Wikipedia.Sisay Fissaha Adafre and [Maarten de Rijke] (2005). Discovering missing links in Wikipedia Proc. LinkKDD. In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. They used PageRank \\"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\\".

Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2(CSCW), 21.  Related projects  Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2), with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).The Free Encyclopedia Project gnu.org ( ) One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative. Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

He is based on the vampire Count Dracula from the novel of the same name by author Bram Stoker. After the initial run of the series The Tomb of Dracula, the character has been depicted primarily as an antagonist to superheroes in the Marvel Universe.  Publication history  The cover of The Tomb of Dracula vol.1 #1 (April 1972), in which Gerry Conway and Gene Nolan's iteration of Bram Stoker's character made his debut. Cover by Neal Adams. The Marvel version of Dracula was created by Gerry Conway and Gene Colan in The Tomb of Dracula (vol. 1) #1 (1972), co-written by Marv Wolfman. A different version of Dracula had previously appeared in the Atlas Comics publication, Suspense #7 (Mar. 1951). Traditionally, the Comics Code Authority prevented Marvel from publishing vampire comics. This was revised in early 1971, when comics were allowed to publish characters and beings from established literary works. Later that year, Morbius the Living Vampire appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man for the first time, and Dracula followed in his own title some months later. The character starred in the comic, which ended with issue #70 in 1979. This version of Dracula also starred in Dracula Lives!, a black-and- white horror comic magazine series published by Marvel from 1973 to 1975. Running concurrently with The Tomb of Dracula, the continuities of the two titles occasionally overlapped, with storylines weaving between the two. Tomb of Dracula initially kept its distance from the rest of the company's properties. Marv Wolfman said, \\"To me, the horror books were outside the Marvel Universe. It was a hard enough problem creating mood, tension, and suspense in a comic book, which is all still pictures. But to then have to worry about superheroes or supervillains at the same time — I didn't feel that would work.\\" But the potential for a sales-boosting crossover eventually became too tempting, and Dracula appeared in the first issue of Giant-Size Spider-Man (July 1974). Although Dracula (and all other vampires) were eventually destroyed by the mystical \\"Montesi Formula\\" in the pages of Doctor Strange, the vampire lord was revived. Marvel published a four-issue Tomb of Dracula miniseries, reuniting Wolfman and Colan, under its Epic Comics imprint in 1991, and revived Dracula and his foes in the short-lived Nightstalkers and Blade series in the 1990s. Most recently, Dracula took the title role in the miniseries Dracula: Lord of the Undead. X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula featured Dracula battling the X-Men's greatest foe, Apocalypse, in Victorian London. The character returns in the Captain Britain and MI13 storyline \\"Vampire State\\",Appearing first at the end of the previous arc Captain Britain and MI13 #9 with Doctor Doom.Bloody Hell: Cornell on Captain Britain, Comic Book Resources, January 21, 2009Newsarama 9: Paul Cornell, Newsarama, February 11, 2009 He was the main subject of the 2010 X-Men storyline \\"Curse of the Mutants\\", written by Victor Gischler. By this time, Dracula no longer adopts the dress and mannerisms of a Victorian era nobleman, rather his appearance is more reminiscent of a medieval warlord. He wears a form of body armor and a cape with ragged ends. He has long blonde hair maintained in a ponytail and inhuman features such as red eyes, elongated canines, and retractable claws at the tips of his fingers and pointed ears.  Fictional character biography  = Historical = Born Vlad Dracula in 1430 in Schassburg, Transylvania (now Sighişoara, Romania), he was the second son of a Transylvanian nobleman. He was named prince of Transylvania and voivode (prince) of Wallachia and became ruler while still a child. Over the next several years, he struggled against the Ottoman Turks, losing and regaining his throne. Through an arranged marriage to a Hungarian noblewoman, Zofia, he sired his daughter, Lilith. He sent his wife and daughter away and later married a woman named Maria, with whom he had a son named Vlad Tepelus. He had a son with his third wife Domini named Janus. In 1459, Dracula was mortally wounded by the Turkish warlord Turac, who brought Dracula to a gypsy named Lianda to be healed. However, Lianda was a vampire, and in revenge for his persecution of the gypsies, transformed Dracula into a vampire as well. Turac raped and killed Dracula's wife Maria, and in revenge Dracula slew Turac, making him a vampire as well. Dracula gave his son Vlad Tepelus to gypsies to raise.Dracula Lives! #1. Marvel Comics. Dracula defeated the vampire Nimrod the First in battle, and thus succeeded him as ruler of Earth's vampires. Soon afterwards, he enhanced his own blood with that of Varnae, giving him greater powers than any other vampire. In 1471, Dracula abdicated his princehood. In the 19th century, he faced opposition from Abraham van Helsing and Jonathan Harker in England, the exploits of which were recorded in the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker, Dracula. When the humans destroyed Dracula, his remains were placed in his coffin, concealed within a cave blocked by an enormous boulder. Frankenstein's Monster was later tricked into unsealing the cave and opening the coffin, thus freeing Dracula.The Frankenstein Monster #7–8. Marvel Comics. In later years, he also came in conflict with Cagliostro and Solomon Kane.

He first contacted Doctor Doom to agree to a non-aggression pact with him, and by association the Cabal, in order to be unopposed in his conquest. Once he'd secured this, he launched a pre-emptive strike on MI-13's superheroes, launching specially-bred vampires at the Earth like missiles. It was also shown he still possessed contempt and bigotry towards Muslims, and intended to exterminate them once he had secured Great Britain; as part of his attack, he went to the parents of Faiza Hussain,Captain Britain and MI-13 #10. Marvel Comics. attacking her mother and taking her father (along with Killpower, an MI-13 agent sent to protect the family) hostage.Captain Britain and MI-13 #11. Marvel Comics. British vampire hero Spitfire, meanwhile, was abducted and forcibly turned into a minion. MI-13 were manipulated into exposing the whereabouts of Quincy Harker's remains, magically treated to prevent vampires from entering the U.K. without invitation, so Dracula could destroy them. Once that was done, with the help of Fate, he launched a series of warships towards Earth. However, unknown to Dracula, Pete Wisdom had tricked him into destroying fake remains and Spitfire had been faking her mind control while channeling information to MI-13. In order to stop Dracula from finding out the remains were fake, he was briefly trapped in a demonic \\"Dream Corridor\\" which saw him live out his fantasies of victory (ending with him standing in a conquered House of Commons while holding the Speaker's mace); as well as giving MI-13 some intelligence on his plans, it stopped him from sending in advance teams. Once he escaped, there were a series of attacks to keep him occupied until the warships entered British airspace without invitation, wiping out the bulk of his forces. In the final battle, he was pursued to his fortress and prevented from escaping by the Black Knight and Faiza Hussain, wielder of the sword Excalibur. While Dracula was able to seriously wound the Black Knight, he was slain with a single blow from Excalibur, leaving Britain victorious.Captain Britain and MI 13 #13–15. Marvel Comics. In a 2010 X-Men storyline \\"Curse of the Mutants\\", Dracula has been killed by his son Xarus, but is resurrected by the X-Men in hopes that he would join them against Xarus. However, Dracula declines and leaves shortly after.Gischler, Victor. X-Men (vol. 3) #3 (November 2010). Marvel Comics. Dracula reasserts himself as Lord of the Vampires, granting amnesty to those who sided with Xarus. When Xarus tries to attack Dracula, he rips off Xarus' head. Although he contemplated attacking the X-Men, Cyclops reminded him that they had had custody of his body for 17 hours before the head was reattached, suggesting that they had included a 'contingency plan' in Dracula similar to the plan that they had used to infiltrate Xarus' forces by temporarily shutting down Wolverine's healing factor so that he could be turned and then returned to normal. Although Dracula suspected that Cyclops was bluffing, he complimented Cyclops's style and allowed them to depart, even returning the now-vampire Jubilee to the X-Men.X-Men (vol. 3) #5. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Fear Itself\\" storyline, Dracula is informed of the arrival of the Hulk (in the form of Nul: Breaker of Worlds) by one of his followers when Nul lands in the Carpathian foothills following his fight with Thor and ends up taking down some vampires. It is revealed that he has the mysterious Raizo Kodo and his legion of vampires called \\"the Forgiven\\" locked up in his dungeon.Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #1 Dracula frees the Forgiven, who worked to slow Nul's progress. Dracula then prepares the vampires for his last stand.Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #2. Marvel Comics. As the Forgiven continue to stall Nul, Dracula prepares his vampire armies for battle when Nul gets closer. In the end, Nul is defeated when Inka uses a vampire-mesmerizing spell to take the form of Betty Ross, causing the Hulk to break free of the hammer's magic and revert to normal.Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #3. Marvel Comics. In \\"Dracula's Gauntlet\\", Dracula hired Deadpool to retrieve his fiancé, a succubus queen named Shiklah. On the way, she falls in love with him instead and, during the extended trip, her brothers are killed by Dracula to secure the kingdom of Monster Metropolis as his own. This causes Shiklah to deny him the throne by marrying Deadpool, driving Dracula into a rage not because of the power and kingdom he lost, but because he was cuckolded by \\"an escaped mental patient\\". After a fight in which he is stabbed with Deadpool's severed hand, poisoned by the mercenary's blood and his army mostly wiped out, Dracula flees into hiding, leaving Shiklah as Queen of the Monsters. Possibly a little over a year later, there is trouble in his ex-fiancé's marriage. Shiklah has had enough of the humans and started a war to annex New York. Deadpool comes to Dracula for help in stopping her, threatening him with a wooden stake. Dracula cannot remember Shiklah's name at first, until Deadpool angrily reminds him. He states that he hates Deadpool, who replies that Dracula hates himself more, which actually makes him Shiklah's type. Once they return to New York, Dracula is able to gain control of the vampires in Shiklah's army to fight against her monsters. However, the second he meets Shiklah, he proposes to her — wanting to merge their kingdoms and rule with the humans at their feet. Deadpool angrily curses Dracula. Dracula and Shiklah are married by Mephisto, while an angry Deadpool and a confused Spider-Man are tied up and made to watch. Dracula and Shiklah share a kiss, and she thanks him for giving her the wedding she always wanted — with chaos and fire burning.Deadpool and the Mercs for Money #10. Marvel Comics. They head off to tell their followers of their union. However, Shiklah's monsters tell her that they do not wish to be ruled by a monarch any longer. Shiklah is shocked that her subjects want her run off, and Deadpool shows up to tell her that she cannot marry Dracula. He argues that the entire reason they married was because he was saving her from Dracula, reminding her that Dracula killed her brothers. Shiklah shrugs it off, and tells Deadpool that he would have done the same if he knew them. She then attacks him, telling him that he cannot tell her who she can impetuously marry. After one last tryst and talk with Deadpool, Shiklah emerges and tells Dracula to let their subjects rule themselves, stating that she does not want to rule by force. Dracula eventually relents, stating that he was retired anyway before Deadpool dragged him into this fight. He leaves with Shiklah, who wants to see more of the world. Shiklah wrote Deadpool a note, stating she was off for some stake-play with Dracula.Deadpool vol. 4 #29. Marvel Comics. Dracula returns to his castle in Romania without Shiklah, and somehow begins summoning all vampires in the world to him, including Jubilee. Old Man Logan tracks Jubilee to Dracula's castle, where it is revealed that she is under the vampire's control. Dracula bites Old Man Logan, but his healing factor is able to resist vampirism. Jubilee eventually breaks free from Dracula's influence, allowing Old Man Logan to decapitate Dracula. Dracula's head is given to a Sentinel that then throws it into the Sun.Old Man Logan #14–15.

Dracula gained the powers of a vampire from his transformation into a vampire by the bite of the vampiress Lianda, and gained additional power by Varnae. Dracula possesses far greater powers than most vampires. He is superhumanly strong (to the point of standing toe-to-toe and defeating Colossus in single combat), and also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, reflexes, and transvection. He is immune to aging, conventional disease, sickness and most forms of injury. He cannot be killed or permanently injured by conventional means. He is unaffected by most assaults and, due to his healing factor, can rapidly regenerate damaged tissue. Dracula can manipulate the minds of others, and command animals, such as rats, bats, and wolves, to his will. With limited exceptions, he may control other vampires. He has the ability to mentally control victims he has bitten, and can temporarily hypnotize anyone with his gaze. He is capable of shapeshifting into a bat – either normal or human size – or a wolf while retaining his intelligence and into a fog or mist – partially or fully – and has the ability of weather control, such as summoning electrical storms. Like some vampires in other works of fiction, Dracula does not cast a reflection in mirrors and his image cannot be captured on film. His powers have been greatly amplified and his weaknesses circumvented by magical sources, such as the spells of the Darkholders. Dracula has a dependence on the ingestion of fresh blood to sustain his existence, and an inability to endure direct sunlight. He falls into a comatose state during daylight hours and must spend much time in contact with his native soil. He has vulnerabilities to garlic (which can both repel him and prevent him from changing form), silver and wood (both of which can cause severe pain, the latter to a lesser extent unless it penetrates his heart) and the presence of religious symbols (wielded by one who believes in their spiritual meaning), and can be killed either by beheading or by a wooden stake or blade made of silver driven through his heart. He can also be destroyed by the spell in the Darkhold known as the Montesi Formula (named after Brother Montesi, the late monk who both discovered it and first realized what it was). Dracula is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman with centuries of experience, specializing in 15th-century warfare and militaristic strategy. He has a gifted intellect, and studied under tutors in his youth in Transylvania.  Other versions  In the mid-1970s, Roy Thomas and Dick Giordano created a serialized adaptation of the original Bram Stoker novel, published in 10- to 12-page installments in the short-lived series Dracula Lives! Following the cancellation of Dracula Lives!, an additional installment of their adaptation appeared in Marvel Preview #8 (\\"The Legion of Monsters\\"),Marvel Preview No. 8 (Fall 1976) at the Grand Comics Database for a total of 76 pages comprising roughly one-third of the novel. After a 30-year hiatus, Marvel commissioned Thomas and Giordano to finish the adaptation, and ran the reprinted and new material as the four-issue miniseries Stoker's Dracula (Oct. 2004 – May 2005).Stoker's Dracula (Marvel, 2004 series) at the Grand Comics Database The entire adaptation was collected by Marvel Illustrated in 2010.

It also includes practical methods for correcting this bias by producing journalism in both the mainstream and alternative media, and working with journalists, media professionals, audiences, and organizations in conflict. This concept was proposed by Johan GaltungFor example see the policy recommendations in the conclusion of: Galtung, J. & Ruge, M. (1965). The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers. Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91.

Retrieved October 5, 2010. constructive conflict coverage, and reporting the world.Reporting the World War journalism is journalism about conflict that has a value bias towards violence and violent groups. This usually leads audiences to overvalue violent responses to conflict and ignore non-violent alternatives. This is understood to be the result of well documented news reporting conventions. These conventions focus only on physical effects of conflict (for example ignoring psychological impacts) and elite positions (which may or may not represent the actual parties and their goals). It is also biased toward reporting only the differences between parties, (rather than similarities, previous agreements, and progress on common issues) the here and now (ignoring causes and outcomes), and zero sums (assuming that one side's needs can only be met by the other side's compromise or defeat).Galtung, Johan, “On the role of the media in worldwide security and peace,” In Tapio Varis (ed.), Peace and Communication, pp. 249–266, San Jose, Costa Rica: Universidad para La Paz. Peace journalism aims to correct for these biases. Its operational definition is \\"to allow opportunities for society at large to consider and value non- violent responses to conflict\\".Lynch, 2008, p.147. This involves picking up calls for, and articulations of, non-violence policies from whatever quarter, and allowing them into the public sphere. Origins Peace journalism workshop in Mindanao, the Philippines Peace journalism follows a long history of news publication, originating in non-sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early 19th century, which published periodicals.Roberts, Nancy L., \\"Peace Journalism,\\" The International Encyclopedia of Communication, Wolfgang Donsbach (ed), Blackwell Publishing, 2008. Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the 19th century, as did utopian communities of the period. From the 20th century, a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker.Roberts, Nancy L., American peace writers, editors, and periodicals: A dictionary, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991. Besides being an element in the histories of pacifism and the social movement press, peace journalism is a set of journalism practices that emerged in the 1970s. Norwegian sociologist, peace researcher and practitioner Johan Galtung proposed the idea of peace journalism for journalists to follow to show how a value bias towards violence can be avoided when covering war and conflict.Seow Ting Lee & Crispin C. Maslog, \\"War or Peace Journalism? Asian Newspaper Coverage of Conflicts,\\" Journal of Communication 55 (June 2005): p. 311. Christian organizations such as The World Council of Churches and The World Association for Christian Communication also practice peace journalism. Peace journalism aims to shed light on structural and cultural causes of violence, as they impact upon the lives of people in a conflict arena as part of the explanation for violence. It aims to frame conflicts as consisting of many parties and pursuing many goals rather than a simple dichotomy. An explicit aim of peace journalism is to promote peace initiatives from whatever quarter and to allow the reader to distinguish between stated positions and real goals. Necessity Peace journalism came about through research arguing there's something wrong with typical conflict reporting. Research and practice in peace journalism outlines a number of reasons for the existence and dominance of war journalism in conflict news. =Other interests= Firstly, the notion that media elites always act to preserve their favored status quo, and their own commercial and political interests, is given relatively little weight. Shared characteristics of the socio-economic class, which heavily influences the production of journalism, are important. For example, their shared ideological pressures, perceptions, attitudes, and values form the basis of a \\"dominant reading\\" of facts that are selected to appear in news. These can then act to fix and naturalize meaning and hide the actual creation of meaning.Lynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2005). Peace Journalism. Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press, p.197 & p.211; also see McGoldrick, 2008, p.95. However, even in the presence of powerful elite media interests against war, war journalism often dominates conflict discourse. Jake Lynch and Annabel McGoldrick show examples from Britain, Ireland, Georgia, and Iraq, where war journalism dominated coverage despite key influential media interests against war.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, pp.198–199. =Journalistic objectivity= Peace journalist Jake Lynch covering protests against joint US-Australia military exercises in Australia. Therefore, not only political and economic, but also social and cultural factors have contributed to the dominance of war journalism in conflict reporting. With the growth of mass media, especially from the 19th century, news advertising became the most important source of media revenue. Whole audiences needed to be engaged across communities and regions to maximize advertising revenue. This led to \\"Journalistic objectivity as an industry standard…a set of conventions allowing the news to be presented as all things to all people\\".Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.203 And in modern journalism, especially with the emergence of 24 hour news cycles, speed is of the essence in responding to breaking stories. It is not possible for reporters to decide \\"from first principals\\" every time how they will report each and every story that presents itself.Lynch,J. (2008). Debates in Peace Journalism. Sydney: Sydney University Press, p.7 It follows that convention governs much of journalism. The rise of journalistic objectivity was part of a larger movement within western academia to a more empirical \\"just report the facts” epistemology and research paradigm. By the 1890s it was focused on the ideal of “objectivity”.Mindich, 2000, p.13 And although it came into fashion around the same period, Journalistic Objectivity must be distinguished from the Scientific Objectivity. For example the experimental sciences uses as \\"best practice\\": # Inter-laboratory replication; # Random assignment of subjects to conditions; # Efforts to ensure that human subjects and experimenters are ignorant of the expectations (hypotheses)of the research: to avoid the Observer-expectancy effect # The Subject-expectancy effect; # Anonymous peer review, a form of peer review, to promote open and systematic exploration of meaning without subjective, \\"political\\" bias; # Careful analysis to ensure that research subjects are adequately representative of the general population, that is not overly atypical when compared to the average population. While it is arguable whether these experimental science safe guards provide “true objectivity”, in the absence of these safeguards, journalism around conflict relies on three conventions to maintain its own form of \\"objectivity\\" ( also see journalistic objectivity), and is therefore distinct from Scientific Objectivity. Conventions Firstly, to sell audiences to advertisers, reporting must appeal to as broad an audience as possible and therefore focuses on “facts” that are the least controversial. Conflict processes are often controversial, so coverage of them risks alienating potential consumers, who may be sensitive to the exposure of structural or cultural predisposing factors.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210. Secondly, a bias in favor of official sources means that, while it may appear uncontroversial, as there is only one official representative for the government on any given issueLynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2009). Day four, Sunday August 30. Lecture presented in the Conflict Resolving Media course, the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, the University of Sydney. and since only the official government is usually allowed to wield legal, sanctioned force within its territoryMax Weber, Essays in Sociology, ed./trans./intro. H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1946, p.78. coverage will tend to privilege violent responses to conflict over non- violent, social-psychological, context-informed responses.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 209. Journalists Annabel McGoldrick and Jake Lynch argue that non- critical reporting of official sources is often rewarded by those sources. Through \\"information transactions\\", these same official sources allow uncritical journalists privileged access to information in the future.Lynch and McGoldrick, 2009. Thirdly and lastly, 'dualism' biasses journalistic objectivity towards violence: \\"A decision to tell a story in that [bipolar] way can slip past, unnoticed, without drawing attention to itself because of its close resemblance, in shape and structure, to so much of the story-telling we already take for granted\\".Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 210. =Gatekeeping= These conventions also form “gates” by which “gatekeepers” in journalism include or exclude various aspects of reality in final publication.Barzilai-Nahon, K. (2008). Toward a Theory of Network Gatekeeping: A Framework for Exploring Information Control. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59, 1493–1512; White, D. (1950). The “gate keeper:” A case study in the selection of news. Journalism Quarterly, 27, 383–390. In this way, proponents of peace journalism argue that in the media meaning occurs according to: “a set of rules and relations established before the reality or the experience under discussion actually occurred”.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 213. In war journalism the objectivity conventions serve this purpose, but are shadowy and unacknowledged.Lynch, 2008, p. 6 “Gatekeeping” is therefore likely to be secretive and haphazard. This means they distort, and also fix, meaning in conflict coverage and obfuscate the production of meaning.Hall, S. (1997). Representation and the media. (Transcript). Media Education Foundation. Northampton: United States. Retrieved July 23, 2007. A recent example demonstrates how peace journalism evaluative criteria might be applied to show how much conventional conflict reporting is biased in favor of violence and violent groups. The example is the coverage leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and US President Barack Obama. Reporting was highly reactive and focused on the visible effects of the conflict, such as announcements and public disagreements between official spokespeople that appeared to disrupt peace efforts.For example see: Benhorin, Y. (2009, July, 22). Mitchell, Gates, Jones to visit Jerusalem next week., Ynetnews.com. Retrieved October 3, 2009; Hardy, R. (2009, September 7). Obama Mid-East plans in jeopardy, BBC.

(2009, September 9). Likud rebels rebuke Netanyahu over settlements. The Sydney Morning Herald (print edition), p. 10. Coverage was oriented to elites with little mention of non-official peace efforts by individuals and groups such as the Hand in Hand network of schools, the Israeli/Palestinian The Parents Circle Families Forum, Peace Now, Breaking the Silence, Physicians for Human Rights, Machsom Watch, and Checkpoint Watch, Hanan Ashrawi (non-violent activist for human rights, founder of the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy, and member of the Palestinian Legislative Council).We Will Not ObeySheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement Also ignored were programmes that promote cultural exchange, for example (the Israeli-Palestinian Aussie Rules football team The Peace Team), see here for official 2011 team details) which played in the 2008 and 2011 AFL International Cups. Another is the current programme of Palestinian children's visits to the Old Yishuv Court Museum in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. Events demonstrating non-violent responses to the conflict were also ignored, a new example being the March 12, 2011, Conference on Civil Disobedience in the West Bank marking the centenary of International Women's Day.For an outline of some of these groups' activities see Lynch, 2008; and Lynch, J. & McGoldrick, A. (2005). Peace Journalism. Gloucestershire: Hawthorn Press Projects working for peace among Arabs and Israelis lists further organizations working for peace in the region, whose activities are generally excluded from news on the Conflict. Reporting leading up to the September 2009 meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Obama focused almost solely on highly divisive issues, such as Israeli illegal settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem, and the diplomatic/official status of Jerusalem. Coverage was also oriented towards differences, with a focus on the here and now. Potential benefits in physical, economic, and social security of peaceful relations were ignored, and “progress” towards peace was portrayed as having to come with one or more parties compromising and surrendering their positions on key issues, which is of course a zero sum orientation.Barker, A. (2009, June 15). Israeli PM endorses Palestinian independence. ABC (Australia): Lateline. Retrieved October 3, 2009; Israel could freeze settlements for 9 months-official (2009, September 18).

Retrieved October 1, 2009; Kousoutkis, 2009) Coverage generally ignored the background or context of positions. Positions were presented as unchangeable on any peaceful settlement, rather than the public \\"face\\" of unmet needs that often drive violent conflicts. Because of distrust between parties these needs are often not honestly expressed publicly.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 44. Thus a pattern of war journalism emerges, largely stemming from the objectivity conventions applied to conflict reporting. Peace journalism argues that this is likely to have important and consistent effects on the way audiences understand a conflict. In war journalism, violence is typically presented as only its own cause, ignoring the possibility of structural or psychological causes. Since violence is assumed to have no cause or explanation (such as the deprived needs of parties), conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers to conclude that the only “natural” or reasonable response to violence is more violence.Lynch, J. (2008). Debates in Peace Journalism, Sydney: Sydney University Press, p. 186 That “more violence—‘the only language they understand'—is an appropriate remedy”, and that non-violent responses are irrelevant or 'unrealistic'. This focus on only physical violent behavior is an example of what leading Conflict Analyst and Peace Researcher, Johan Galtung identifies as a major flaw in responses to inter-communal conflict: the “Conservative Fallacy”.Galtung, J. (2000). Conflict transformation by peaceful means (the Transcend method): Pariticpants’ manual, trainers’ manual, Geneva: The United Nations,Module III, p. 3. This bias towards prioritizing violent actors with coverage is then expected by violent groups, through what is called a Feedback Loop.First outlined by Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p. 216 Parties to a conflict often try to use the media to advance their position, rather than being passive subjects, unaware of being observed, as assumed in sciences where humans are not the subjects. Journalist, and journalism Associate Professor, Jake Lynch notes that \\"it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour\\".Lynch, 2008, p. 61. In this way war journalism is an example of the role of power in representation and of the media trying to fix meaning, in this case about violence and its causes, for “it to become naturalized so that is the only meaning it can possibly carry…where you cannot see that anybody ever produced it.\\"Hall, S. (1997). Representation and the media. (Transcript). Media Education Foundation, pp. 19, 21–22 . Retrieved July 23, 2007. Thus, war journalism is understood as reporting on conflict in a way which imposes an artificially confined closed space, and closed time, with causes and exits existing only in the conflict arena.Lynch, J. (2008). Debates in Peace Journalism, Sydney: Sydney University Press, pp. 147, 162 Peace journalism can then be understood as journalism that avoids this outside imposition, which more objectively assesses the possibility of conflicts taking place in open space, and open time with any number of causes and exits. Effects The Salvadoran Civil War, largely a peasant revolution, took place 1980–92. The USA supported the right-wing government. During the war 75,000 people were killed, 8,000 more went missing and another million exiled. On 17 March 1980, the village of Ingenio Colima was attacked by paramilitaries who murdered all its occupants. At the time, the country’s media gave a biased account of what took place. The intention today – in the face of open hostility from today’s political leaders is to investigate and clarify what happened and to contribute to a national process of truth and reconciliation.See www.waccglobal.org The emotional effects of war journalism also make it more difficult for audiences to be aware of this biased presentation of conflict. War journalism takes advantage of the emotional “high” humans can get from fear through evolutionary psychological mechanisms.Lynch, 2008, pp. 291–297; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94 In a similar way, war journalism appeals to \\"lower order\\" needs for security and belonging.Maslow, A. (1970). Motivation and Personality. New York: Harper & Row, pp. 18–21; McGoldrick, 2008, p. 94 The pre-frontal cortex, governing working memory, rational attentive functioning, and complex thought is inhibited by activation of the brain’s fear centre, the limbic system.Black, B.

This cognitive deprivation also further fixes meaning and increases the role of “automatically activated attitudes” which according to cognitive psychology: \\"guide attention toward attitude-consistent information, provide a template with which to interpret ambiguous information, and…guide behaviour in a relatively spontaneous fashion\\".Olson, M. and Fazio, O. (2006). Reducing automatically activated racial prejudice through implicit evaluative conditioning. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 32, 421–433, see p. 421. Therefore viewers are primed to pay more attention to future information, which is consistent with the automatically activated attitudes formed by war journalism. Research into the ever present framing in the media supports this conclusion: “Certainly people can recall their own facts, forge linkages not made explicitly in the text, or retrieve from memory a causal explanation or cure that is completely absent from the text. In essence, this is just what professors encourage their students to do habitually. But Zaller (1992), Kahneman and Tversky (1984), and Iyengar (1991), among others, suggest that on most matters of social or political interest, people are not generally so well-informed and cognitively active, and that framing therefore heavily influences their responses to communications”.Entman, R, (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm’, Journal of Communication, 43, 51–58, see p. 56. Research shows that war journalism can have negative emotional impacts on audience members. These include feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness, compounded by increased anxiety, mood disturbance, sadness and a sense of disconnection with physical and social environments. Research by Galtung and Ruge (1965) finds negativity bias in foreign news. This has also been confirmed more recently by Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2008).Galtung, J. & Ruge, M. (1965). The Structure of Foreign News: The Presentation of the Congo, Cuba and Cyprus Crises in Four Norwegian Newspapers. Journal of Peace Research, 2, pp. 64–91; Nohrstedt, S. & Ottosen, R. (2008). War journalism and the Threat Society. Conflict and Communication Online, 7, pp. 1–17. This can affect reactions towards the conflict itself, and an audience’s general psychological wellbeing, which biasses their view of the world as excessively chaotic and may cause serious anxiety and emotional difficulties, and a sense of disempowerment and disconnection.Frohlich, G. (2004). Emotional intelligence in Peace Journalism., Master of Arts Thesis. European University Center for Peace Studies, pp.17, 47. Retrieved October 12, 2009; McGoldrick, A. (2008).

Negative Psychological Effects of Watching the News in the Television: Relaxation or Another Intervention May Be Needed to Buffer Them! International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 14, 57–62, see p. 60. Vicarious trauma can increase these negative effects, where \\"even ‘normal’, intelligent, educated individuals can become highly suggestible towards violent acts in formerly unexpected contexts\\".Frohlich, 2004, p. 60. These negative emotional states may discourage audience members from criticism and challenge of the biassed information presented through war journalism. These public concerns may appear to be \\"someone else’s problem\\" and best left to \\"experts\\", who alone have the necessary knowledge, time, and emotional endurance. These negative emotional responses may also discourage creative engagement with the conflict and conflict parties. This is especially troubling considering the critical role of creativity in conflict resolution and peacebuilding.Fisher, R. J. (1997). Interactive Conflict Resolution. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, pp. 26–36; Lederach, J. (1995). Preparing for peace: Conflict transformation across cultures. Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, pp. 55–62; Schirch, L. (2002). Human Rights and Peacebuilding: Towards Justpeace. Paper presented at the 43rd Annual International Studies Association Convention, New Orleans, Louisiana, 24–27 March 2002, pp. 12–14). Feedback loop Peace journalism analysis suggests that typical news on conflict, with its value bias towards violence and violent groups, has important effects on the parties to conflict. Firstly, peace journalism proponents argue that the bias in favour of publicity for violence and violent actors, \\"plays into\\" the interests of violent actors to intimidate and disrupt the peace process.Frohlich, 2004, p. 63. This is an important example of the Feedback Loop effect: \\"it is not the influence of news on public opinion as such, but assumptions by parties to conflict about its likely or possible influence, that condition their behaviour\\". This bias also weakens and punishes, with less publicity, non-violent groups affected by a conflict, for their lack of violence. Nohrstedt and Ottosen (2002) note: \\"if traditional media themselves are unable to transmit alternative perspectives and voice the danger is that those […] that feel marginalised will turn to terror in order to make a difference in the media agenda\\".Nohrstedt & Ottosen 2002, p. 13. The most visible actions of a group, of which one is not a member, are often considered representative of that group’s behaviour (an effect called the “availability heuristic”).Rothman, A. J. & Hardin, C. D. (1997). Differential use of the availability heuristic in social judgement. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 123-138. Therefore war journalism's over-selection of violent, as opposed to non-violent, responses to conflict may actually foster a misperception of excessive threat between parties. This is then generally exaggerated by other inter-group social- cognitive biases within war journalism. These include biases towards: seeing an outgroup as more homogeneous (with less internal variety) than it really is, ignoring the variety of attitudes towards the conflict;Boldry, J.

Indeed Dr. Louis Kriesberg, a sociologist at Syracuse University, and expert on conflict resolution points out that: \\"conventional thinking among partisans in a fight generally attributes destructive persistence in a conflict to the enemy's character, asserting that the enemy is aggressive by nature, has evil leaders, or adheres to a hostile ideology\\".Kriesberg, Louis, ‘Waging conflicts constructively’ in Handbook of Conflict Analysis and Resolution (London: Routledge, 2009), p.162. And Professor of World Religions, Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution, Marc Gopin, agrees with the importance of psychological factors in escalating conflict: \\"being hated normally generates deep injury and corresponding anger in most recipients is what I call a \\"conflict dance\\" of action/reaction\\".Gopin, Marc, ‘Conflict Resolution as a Religious Experience: Contemporary Mennonite Peacemaking’ in Between Eden and Armageddon: The Future of World Religions, Violence and Peacemaking (Oxford: Oxford U.P., 2000), p.143. A peace journalism perspective also highlights another effect of typical conflict journalism on the groups engaged in a conflict: war journalism's common focus on the human drama and tragedy of violence. Hamber and Lewis (1997) note war journalism \\"often involves painting doomsday scenarios of victims who are irreparably damaged and for whom there appears to be no solution and no future\\".Hamber, B & Lewis, S. (1997). An Overview of the Consequences of Violence and Trauma in South Africa. Research paper written for the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation. Retrieved October 10, 2009. This creates an increased impediment for the victims of unreported crimes. And the positive experiences of those who have embarked upon a process of recovery is often ignored in war journalism.Hamber & Lewis, 1997, see section:Is Post-Traumatic Stress… For example in Israel/Palestine, victims of suicide bombing, house demolition, land and house theft, are often portrayed as defenceless, disempowered victims with no prospect of healing or positive response to their predicament.Kershner, 2009; Koutsoukis, 2009; US: Too soon to discuss Israel sanctions.

Effective non-violent bridge building between communities such as the Hand in Hand Arab/Jewish school network in Israel, are routinely ignored in war journalism coverage.

Parties are therefore presented with a biassed picture of the entire conflict, favouring violent responses to the conflict. Parties are led to believe that that violence is the only way their needs can be met, thereby reinforcing and escalating cycles of dangerous retaliation between groups. Peace journalism would also charge that this pattern of conventional conflict reporting submerges the emotional cost of violent conflict and therefore makes the psychological aspects of cycles of revenge subtle, and so more difficult to prevent.Lee, S. & Maslog, C, & Kim, H. (2006). Asian conflicts and the Iraq War- a comparative framing analysis. International Communications Gazette, 68, 499-518. All of this missed information could represent a crucial movement away from violence, as the only option for threatened groups towards peace. But only if they are not hidden by journalistic assumptions that they are irrelevant, and should not be reported. This is of special concern, given that the collective trauma suffered by a population, and the fear that this generates, can lead to a reduced capacity for decision making and action.Etter, J. (2004, November 2). How does Fondation Hirondelle help a population living in a violent conflict area to participate actively in the conflict-solving negotiation process?

Retrieved October 12, 2009, see section: A \\"Citizen Media\\". Response In response to war journalism’s value bias in favour of violence, peace journalism promises two key benefits: for those concerned with objectivity in journalism, it aims to avoid and counteract the persistent bias of valuing violence and violent parties. Secondly, as all journalism must in some way appeal to the values of their audiences, for those who value the promotion of peace and social justice over violence, it provides a practical methodology. The 'fixation of meaning' in war journalism is often hidden by the “scattered opposition facts” that often occur in its coverage. However these do not actually allow for “challenging a dominant frame” of pro-violence: 'Framing' researcher Entman recommends: \\"If educated to understand the difference between including scattered oppositional facts, and challenging a dominant frame, journalists might be better equipped to construct news that makes equally salient—equally accessible to the average, inattentive, and marginally informed audience—two or more interpretations of problems.\\"Entman, R. (1993). Framing: towards clarification of a fractured paradigm, Journal of Communication, 43, 51-58. =Decisions= Hence, peace journalism is anchored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research “to map out solid ground beneath our feet; to declare, in advance, that we intend to use it, to assign meanings and draw distinctions.”Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.204. Decisions, on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report, can be made openly and systematically. Lynch (2008) shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for conflict journalism in that they employ the academic rigor of the social sciences including: \\"openness about – and prepared to justify – starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation; and peer review. Built into social science, moreover, is an allowance for the participant- observer effect – as soon as you start to observe something, you cannot avoid changing it.\\"Lynch, 2008, p.21 As such peace journalism considers the effect it has on audiences and parties with regard to it own “objectivity”. Lynch and Galtung (2010) elaborate on how this operates in conflict journalism: \\"'It is an important distinction in this context because journalism itself may be part of the extended pattern of conflictual relationships, in which parties and their shared relations find themselves embedded – if only by bringing an audience to the ringside. Tillett comments: 'In some situations, individuals (or groups) will ‘fight to the death’ (even when obviously losing all that they claim to be seeking) to avoid being seen to ‘back down’ or ‘lose face' ' (1999, p. 29). In a conflict, he continues, \\"the presence of an audience generally makes it more likely that the protagonists will want to be seen to win, and that they will be less prepared to resolve than to fight'. Schattschneider goes as far as to argue that spectators are 'an integral part of the situation for, as likely as not, the audience determines the outcome of the fight'(1960, p.2).\\"quoted in Lynch, J. & Galtung, J. (2010). Reporting conflict: New directions in peace journalism. St. Lucia: University of Queensland Press, p.45. =Inter-group violence= Pakistan s the best example of PJ Conflict Analysis also provides guidance on mapping the hopes, needs, and fears of all parties to a conflict, including outwardly “impartial” third parties; and acknowledges the potential role of creativity, rather than assuming as war journalism does, that the positions of elites, power gradients and the struggle for power are the most important determinants of a conflict.Francis, D. (2002). People, peace and power: Conflict transformation in action. London: Pluto Press, p.128; Lederach, J. P. (1997) Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies. Washington, DC: US Institute of Peace Press, p.94; Lynch, 2008, p.21 These can then be assessed empirically in the conflict, and its potential resolution, rather than being ignored from the outset by journalists, as often is the case in war journalism. Therefore the importance in peace journalism of being willing to consider conflict as “open in space and time, with causes and exits anywhere”.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.6. Lynch and Galtung (2010) present an important example of this in the case of North and South Korea, indicating that journalists should not ignore the grassroots people that endure this conflict, and that comparisons and input from the reunified Germany may be helpful, as could consideration and dialogue with East Asia.Lynch and Galtung, 2010, pp.77-79. The aim here is not to impose definite “answers”. Conflict Analysis and Peace Research often elicit useful perspectives from those involved in the conflict. Empirical questions can then be put forward, and tested by investigative journalism. These processes demonstrate that conflict is not static and intractable. These insights challenge the psychological tendencies of war journalism noted above to present negative outgroup behaviour as the result of stable group characteristics. Indeed the non-linear cycle of violence outlined by Elworthy and Rogers (2002), proposes that the key stage to prevent a cycle of revenge, is before the anger becomes bitterness.Elworthy, S. & Rogers, P. (2002). The ‘War on Terrorism’: 12-month audit and future strategy options, Oxford: Oxford Research Group, p.17. And peace journalism can allow for the consideration that “bitterness can be thought of as anger + memory[…]storing away trauma in a ‘trauma bank’ and, eventually, withdrawing it as ‘glory’ through further violence”.Lynch, 2008, p.57 Through reporting, which does not routinely ignore causes and non-linear cycles of violence, peace journalism can help expand the cognitive and emotional space for peace initiatives that contribute peacebuilding.Elworthy and Rogers, 2002, pp.18-24; Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.87; Perez, M. (n.d.). Peace Journalism case study: US media coverage of the war in Iraq. Transcend Research Institute. Retrieved 10 October 2009. The Feedback Loop of cause and effect in the media could then support the creation and continuation of peaceful process-structures .Lederach, 1999, pp.33-35. This would involve demonstrating a pattern of coverage that leads present and potential peace actors to predict that their efforts will be reported by journalists to “create opportunities for society at large to consider and value non-violent responses to conflict”. This in turn could reduce negative inter-group social-psychological tendencies. This may be particularly important for projects such as the examples in Israel/Palestine of the 'Hand in Hand' network of schools, 'Peace Now', 'Breaking the Silence', 'Physicians for Human Rights', 'Machsom Watch' and 'Checkpoint Watch', which as mainly grassroots initiatives, are generally more fragile than mid level or upper level peace activities.Lederach, 1997, p.52. Examples As a pedagogical practice, peace journalism training often uses pairs of war journalism and peace journalism reports to illustrate how the same story can be reported in either style, and that there is the potential to produce peace journalism within the time and travel constraints of mainstream journalism. For a peace journalism/war journalism pair on conflict in the Philippines see Peace Journalism in the Philippines. The transcripts of this report pair, along with an outline of a course in peace journalism can be viewed at A course in peace journalism. For a pair of reports covering Israel/Palestine plus a link to practical tips for avoiding journalism that is biased towards violence and violent actors, see The Middle East—War Journalism and Peace Journalism The documentary News from the Holy Land also contains another pair of reports on the Israel/Palestine conflict. The free Reporting the World publication contains pairs of peace journalism/war journalism news reports on Macedonia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq,and Indonesia. The Cairo based Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation (CIDT) seeks to build bridges of understanding between the Arab and Western world through analysis of the news from these regions. To Be an Effective Advocate for Peace, Media Distortions Must Be Addressed analyses situations where conflict reporting has contributed to the actual worsening of conflict. An example from the Hindustan Times, showing how peace journalism can also operate through awards and commendations publicising and supporting the work of non-violence and cooperative conflict resolution: Afghan, Palestinian win UN award in honour of Gandhi. Peace journalism can also take the form of the public dissemination of research on the successful conditions for non-violent conflict resolution and negotiation such as: Unequal Partners Can't Negotiate by Paul Duffill, writing for New Matilda. For an example in Australia see this report on the protests of the 2009 US and Australian military exercises, Talisman Sabre. TED talk by Julia Bacha on the danger of news about conflict only covering violent actors, excluding non-violent programmes Julia Bacha: Pay attention to nonviolence.

Arab revolutions and the power of nonviolent action by Stephen Zunes, writing for the National Catholic Reporter. Anne Applebaum argues in this piece for the Washington Post that though it is tempting to lump all the recent revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa into a single “Arab revolution,” or \\"Arab Spring\\" the differences between them may turn out to be more important than their similarities: In the Arab world, it's 1848 - not 1989. This report from Michelle Shephard Somalia’s Al Qaeda: A chance for Shabab to negotiate? is an example of a partial PJ piece, where some elements of PJ are present. The piece does not assume there are only two parties, and doesn't assume parties' goals exactly match reported positions, and explores contradictory goals within a single official party. It also reports on peaceful responses to conflict. This report however is generally closed in space and time: with little exploration of the reasons behind the conflict between warring groups (including considering the conduct of the weak national government), or whether parties other than Al Queda/Al Shabab have used violence, and assumes that causes and sources of solutions are restricted to within Somalia itself. The report also does not explore non-elite efforts at peace, even though Somalis rally against al-Qaeda allies suggests that there is local support for peace efforts. Projects A peace journalism project conducted by the Kenya Pastoralist Journalist Network The feedback loop of cause and effectLynch and McGoldrick, 2005, p.216 is a useful reference point here for conceptualising the various “entry points” for peace journalism in the wider phenomenology of news. Peace journalism has been applied in training and dialogue with journalists in a variety of settings.For example see Lynch, 2008, pp.35-36, p.81, p.84, p.85 & p.87; Lynch & Galtung, 2010, pp.135-136 However peace journalism has also been applied in a number of other sectors. These interventions are extremely varied and, in addition to the examples noted above, include international NGO work with local partners and networks in areas of conflict,Lynch & Galtung, 2010, p.196 the promotion of communication rights, participatory processes, community-based communication approaches for development, and social change and peacebuilding (for example see Current Projects-Communication for Social Change & World Association for Christian Communication programmes and further reading sections below) and work with organisations who may themselves become sources for peace journalism.Lynch & McGoldrick,2009 Government and inter-governmental approaches have also facilitated peace journalism in preventing media manipulation and promoting people centred media in post-conflict societies and through the United Nations.Such as Thompson, M. & Price, M. (2003). Intervention, media and human rights, Survival, 45, pp.183-202; Krug, P. & Price, M. (2002). A Module for Media Intervention: Content Regulation in Post- Conflict Zones.

Retrieved June 10, 2010; Civil Society Declaration to the World Summit on the Information Society Unanimously Adopted by the WSIS Civil Society Plenary, Geneva, 8 December 2003. Likewise upper level editors and media organisation managers have participated in peace journalism workshops and seminars.[Lynch, 2008, p.xi & pp.29–31; Lynch & Galtung, 2010, pp. 135–136.] Criticism Peace journalism has aroused a number of debates and criticisms from scholars and journalists. =Objectivity= Some opponents characterise peace journalism as \\"activist\\" new writing that, while being socially engaged to promote peace, is unlike mainstream objective, or balanced, news coverage that seeks to remain impartial or above the fray.for example see Hanitzsch, 2007, pp.367–385. This raises the important question: how objective and impartial is peace journalism? From a peace journalism perspective the claim “we just report the facts” must include the facts of how and according to what principals these “facts” came to meet the reporter, and how the finished coverage came to meet the facts. The Press Institute of India’s conflict reporting guidelines point out: \\"Factual accuracy in a single story is no substitute for the total truth. A single story, which is factually accurate can nonetheless be misleading\\".Lloyd & Toit, 1999, cited in Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.54 As such peace journalism is generally more objective, with its inclusion of implications for international law, positive developments in both elite peacemaking and capacity building, and non-elite perspectives and peacebuilding initiatives. This objectivity, unconstrained by Objectivity Conventions, highlights the truth-orientation of peace journalism: to “expose untruths on all sides”. In doing so peace journalism aims to de- naturalise meaning by highlighting the creation of war journalism dominated meaning in conflict. Indeed Hall (1997) recommends that the unfixing of meaning: “is often a struggle to increase the diversity of things which subjects can be of the possibility of identities which people have not seen represented before[…]you have to intervene in exactly that powerful exchange between image and its psychic meaning[…]with which we invest images [and] expose and deconstruct the work of representation which the stereotype is doing”.Hall, 1997, pp.20-21 And many international negotiation experts and peace practitioners note the importance of non-violent confrontation and the equalisation of power, before effective negotiation and dialogue between parties can take place.Docherty, J. (2005). The little book of strategic negotiation: Negotiating during turbulent times. Intercourse: Good Books, p.22; Francis, 2002, pp.56-57; Keashly, L. & Fisher, R. J.

Through reporting on grassroots and local voices for peace, the power of these voices is increased, as they become \\"reality checkers\\" for often contradictory statements from elite representatives involved in violence. Through this non-violent “ideational confrontation”, audiences and parties to conflict may be more able to negotiate their own meaning, outside of fixed elite narratives. Thus “mounting anomalies may expose contradictions, and herald a paradigm shift” as local pro-peace perspectives previously consigned to a zone of “deviance” become “legitimate controversy”.Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.205 For example, prior to the presidential election of 2009 in Afghanistan, the counter- insurgency approach, advocated by US commander General McCrystal, contained elements of relationship building to a degree that is unusual among military approaches in Afghanistan.Alberts, S.

The US military’s promotion of these methods as successful may of course be a less than “objective” evaluation. However the military’s promotion of relationship building as a legitimate tactic to attempt in addressing violence does contribute to the normative strength of non-violence responses to conflict. In acknowledging the importance of (at least being seen to) build cooperative relationships with local populations (over simply violently suppressing disagreement to military policy) the legitimacy of these non-violent responses to violence conflict is reinforced. And indeed researchers also note the importance of relationship building for 'vertical and horizontal integration' in peacebuildingGopin, M. (2002).

Lecture presented in the Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding course, the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, the University of Sydney and in promoting 'peace with justice' and respect for human rights.Francis, 2002; Schirch, 2002 Peace journalism aims to retain the role of observer in reporting conflict, rather than functioning like war journalism, which intervenes in conflict to increase the influence of violent actors and violent actions. Peace journalism, by presenting “anomalous” local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group’s attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence.Lynch, 2005, pp.204-205 Indeed, exploration of new types of relationships between Afghan locals and the international community, contradicts assertions made at the time, with the support of war journalism, by insurgents and the US government, that the negative effects of foreign occupation could only be ended with their violent expulsion, or that 40,000 more combat troops were the most critical component for sustainable peace in Afghanistan.For examples of this war journalism see: Dombey, D.

It simply needs to be fought and destroyed”.Lynch, 2008, p.52 While this may be a common response to journalism which advocates context, it is also an example of many of the social-cognitive inter-group biases noted above, and exemplifies what social psychologist Phillip Zimbardo (of the Stanford Prison Experiments) calls a Fundamental Attribution Error: “the tendency to explain observed behaviour by reference to dispositions, while ignoring or minimizing the impact of situational variables”.Zimbardo, 2004 The notion of human needs driving violence and being significantly effected by violence (borrowed from Conflict Analysis and Peace Research)Lynch & Galtung, 2010, pp.44-47 and insight into the stratified nature of reality (borrowed from Critical Realism),Dandermark et al. (2002) Explaining society – Critical Realism in the Social Sciences, London: Routledge, see particularly pp.59-66 highlights why an explanation of violence is not the same thing as a justification for it. Critical Realism understands reality as existing in a number of levels or strata. Each strata deals with larger and more complex phenomena than that ones below it. These strata might begin from physical mechanisms at the most basic level, followed by chemical mechanisms, then biological, followed by psychological and finally social. Activity at each lower strata contributes to, but can never fully explain, the new mechanisms that develop in higher strata, in a process called “emergence” from the upper strata. For example, competing theories of sub-atomic structure (perhaps at the physical level) influence but cannot fully explain the outcome of the reaction 2Na+2HCl = 2NaCl + H2 (at the chemical level). Likewise the individual psychologies of a landlord and tenant cannot fully explain their relationship in the social strata, which is also influenced by other things that operate at the social stratum, including laws and culture. Structural and cultural explanations for violence generally deal with the social strata: that is relationships between people and groups. An explanation of this violence is not the same as ignoring the role of individual choice and psychology: the violence that “emerges” at the social level is the result of a complex interaction of influences from lower strata (individual choices and psychology) and structures which exist primarily at the social strata (such as laws and culture). So to give cultural or structural explanations of violence is not the same as saying that these social influences override the role the individual choice (which is located in a lower stratum and therefore occurs under different conditions). Take the case where an individual’s anger (brought on from previous trauma) becomes bitterness, which is followed by their own violent acts, following Elworthy and Rogers (2002) cycle of violence noted above. An individual has still made a choice to deprive the victim of their violence of their human needs (probably safety and security) even though their own human needs have also been violated earlier. The point is not that they must be seen as either a innocent victim or an evil perpetrator. The practical point is the prevention of violence, and the healing of all those whose needs have been violated. This approach does not assume that the best solution for stopping individual violence necessarily exists at the level where an individual makes a choice to act violently (which happens at the psychological level). In some cases punishment or imprisonment may be necessary. However Conflict Analysis and Peace Research suggest that, given the failure of the psychological, medical and social sciences (including education) to eliminate the persistent rates of psychotic tendencies in human groups (psychologists estimate that on average 3 percent of any population have psychotic tendencies),Collier, P. (2007). The bottom billion: Why the poorest countries are falling apart and what can be done about it. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.29 a more promising approach may to look at what social, economic, cultural conditions and what inter-group relations enable individuals such as Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, Stalin and Pol Pot, to realise their desire for mass violence. Conflict Analysis and Peace Research does not primarily focus on understanding the individual psychology of these individuals (at the psychological stratum), but on how these individuals may be prevented from taking up a position in society where they are able to direct inter-communal violence (at the social stratum). Indeed in peace journalism the role of individual agency is given a lot of importance. For example journalists are encouraged, in peace journalism workshops, to work peace journalism into the existing media structures. And peace journalism urges journalists to investigate the possibility that, even in violent situations, there are always voices for peace, and to search these voices out, when reporting what the Objectivity Conventions might ignore from the outset.Lynch, 2008, pp.6-31; Lynch & Galtung, 2010, pp.51-63 Likewise the role of individual choice is not ignored in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research, and leading scholar-practitioner, John Paul Lederach notes that: “I have not experienced any situation in conflict, no matter how protracted or severe, from Central America to the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, where there have not been people who had a vision for peace, emerging often from their own experience of pain. Far too often, however, these same people people are overlooked and disempowered either because they do not represent ‘official’ power, whether on the side of government [or] of the various militias, or because they are written off as biased and too personally affected by the conflict\\".Lederach, 1997, p.94. =Structure versus agency= Hanitzsche (2007) argues that “the failures of corporate journalism cannot be overcome by an individualistic and voluntaristic conceptualization of news making. To have any impact on the ways news is being made, and the critical discussion thereof, the advocates of peace journalism must address the structural constraints of news production[…]a peaceful culture is the precondition of peace journalism.\\"Hanitzsche, 2007, p.7 Structure is a key concern in peace journalism, along with the influence of structure on content pluralism in news.Lynch, 2008, p.28. And a number of projects that apply peace journalism (some of which are outlined above) demonstrate that peace journalism activism is not limited to journalists themselves. Indeed, conflict media content analyses are important educational resources for audiences, NGOs and journalists, to show how deficiencies in content can be used to campaign for more structural pluralism.Lynch, 2008, p.28 ; For examples of content analyses see: Galtung & Lynch, 2010; Lee & Masalog, 2005; Lee, Masalog & Kim, 2006; Baltodano, B., Jared Bishop, J., Hmielowski, J., Kang-Graham, J., Morozov, A., White, B., et al. (2007). Discourses of Blame and Responsibility: U.S./Canadian Media Representations of Palestinian-Israeli Relations. Conflict and Communication Online, 6. These varied approaches demonstrate that inroads have been, and are still being made, in peace journalism activism in the areas Hackett (2006) identifies as necessary to address challenges of structure and to \\"make peace journalism possible”: reforming journalism from within, and also creating alternative media organisations, and intervening in the broader fields in which journalism find itself.Hackett, 2006, p.11 =Audiences= Hanitszche (2007) criticises peace journalism, noting that media users are often “fragmented and active audiences instead of a passive mass[…]leading to a selective use of supplied products”.Hanitzsch, T. (2007). Situating peace journalism in journalism studies: a critical appraisal, Conflict and Communication Online 6, p.6. Likewise Devereux (2003) notes that media audiences “may have different expectations of media genres”Devereux, E. (2003). Understanding the media. London: Sage Publications, p.10 and Turnbull (2002) argues that in media research a serious problem is just to limit and define audiences and therefore relevant media practices.Turnbull, S. (2002). Audiences. In Stuart Cunningham & Graeme Turner (Eds.), The media & communications in Australia (pp. 65-77). Crows Nest: Allen & Unwin. Indeed Hall (1997) notes that the meaning of media messages changes “as you move from one person to another, one group to another, one part of society to another.”Hall, 1997, p.7. And Lynch (2008) points out, drawing from Hall (1980) that “the meanings of media messages are made, at least partly, at the point of reception, in a process influenced chiefly by the socio-economic position of the reader or viewer.”Lynch, 2008, p.15. As such Hall (1980) notes that in a negotiated or oppositional manner, meaning often: \\"contains a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements: it acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions to make the grand significations (abstract), while, at a more restricted, situational (situated) level, it makes its own ground rules - it operates with exceptions to the rule. It accords the privileged position to the dominant definitions of events while reserving the right to make a more negotiated application to 'local conditions'\\".And indeed for many peace journalists it is the visibility of 'local conditions' that allows for oppositional and negotiated meaning. Lynch (2008)argues that “for audiences to produce oppositional or negotiated readings of media messages assumes they have enough directly relevant personal and social experience against which to measure them”,Lynch, 2008, p.29. This is often not the case with international conflict. Indeed Hall’s(1980) own example of the negotiation of meaning is the case of an industrial factory worker, willing to challenge official justifications in the media for an Industrial Relations Bill limiting his or her right to strike. Peace journalism analysis shows that the facts absent in audiences’ understanding of conflict, can closely mirror those neglected in war journalism. A notable example is Philo and colleagues’ research into media coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict in the UK media.Philo, G. (2004, July 14). What you get in 20 seconds. Guardian; Philo, G. (2009). News, audiences and the construction of public knowledge. In S. Allan (Ed.), The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (pp.407-506). Abingdon: Routledge. With mainstream media neglecting the Palestinian narrative that Palestinian refugees lost their land and homes when Israel was established, audiences exhibited consistent ignorance about the basic facts of the conflict (for example where the bulk of refugees came from) and tended to perceive Palestinians as “starting the violence” and therefore Israeli authorities as forced to “respond” violently to prevent or contain this action, which has no possible rationale and therefore no potential non-violent resolution.Philo, 2009, p.502 Indeed five years earlier, when reporting results of the study, Philo (2004) noted that: \\"This pattern of reporting clearly influenced how some viewers understood the conflict[…]The gaps in public knowledge closely parallel those in the news. The Palestinian perspective, that they have lost their land and are living under occupation, was effectively absent. It is perhaps not surprising that some viewers believed that they were simply being aggressive and trying to take land from the Israelis\\".Philo, 2004 This omission of the Palestinian perspective was so serious that Helen Boaden, Head of News at the BBC, concluded in an internal email: “we fail to give enough context and history to this highly charged story and that we neglect the Palestinian narrative[…]In our response, we’ve tried to come up with practical ways to remedy our weaknesses”.cited in Lynch, 2008, p.31 The Israeli–Palestinian conflict has also been the focus of research by Yifat Mor and colleagues, who examined how social media (namely Facebook) can be a tool to promote dialogue between both parties. This is an important illustration of the consistent effect of war journalism across general audiences: “the pattern of misunderstanding almost exactly matching[…]missing elements from the story habitually presented in the mainstream media”.Lynch, 2008, p.29 General media audiences as a group are conceptualised within the Feedback Loop of cause and effect.First outlined in Lynch & McGoldrick, 2005, p.216 =Approaches= Two peace practitioner scholars, John Paul Lederach and Johan Galtung present two quite different models for conflict resolution and peace building. Lederach (1995) presents an “Elictive Model” which is aims “primarily at discovery, creation, and solidification of models that emerge from the resources present in a particular setting and respond to needs in that context” and to not impose third party knowledge from trainer to participant.Lederach, 1995, p.55 & p.62 This approach, was applied in a dialogue in 2003 entitled “Reporting the[sic?] Iraq: what went right? What went wrong?”. Included were Heads of News from the BBC and CNN, the editor of the Guardian, and several senior reporters who had also been reporting the war from Iraq.Lynch, 2008, p.201; Lynch & Galtung, 2010, p.135. Drawing on “the resources in the room” recommendations for the coverage of conflict included: #Do not report a ‘line’ from an official source without obtaining and citing independent evidence as to its reliability. #Acknowledge that the important job of testing arguments is best done if they are juxtaposed with, and weighed against, alternative, countervailing arguments. #All newsrooms genuinely interested in offering a service to the public must think long and hard about ‘conduit’ journalism and, in particular, whether their political correspondents are being used in this way.Lynch, 2008, pp.204-206. # Galtung’s TRANSCEND approach in contrast, focuses on the role a third party to “unstick” violent conflicts and stimulate creativity. This is done by probing deeply into the nature of parties’ goals, expanding the spectrum of acceptable solutions, and opening up cognitive space for fresh potentialities not conceived of by conflict parties.Galtung, J. & Tschudi, F. (2001). Crafting Peace: On the Psychology of the TRANSCEND Approach. In D. J. Christie, R. V. Wagner, & D. D. Winter (Eds), Peace, Conflict, and Violence. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, see pp.210-212 \\"In one-on-one conversation- style dialogues, the task is to stimulate creativity, develop new perspectives, and make the conflict parties 'ready for the table'\\".Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210 Lynch (2008) recounts a notable example of this approach during a peace journalism forum of Middle Eastern journalists, in Amman, in 1999. Discussions often devolved into national groups blaming the journalists of the other countries for not confronting their governments’ lack of movement towards peace. Galtung himself challenged the participants to: “imagine a future Middle East they wanted to see, and start to think aloud, in cross-national groups, about how they might play a part in bringing it about”.Lynch, 2008, p.35 A Galtungian perspective, as a foundation for much of peace journalism, insists that “the journalist focus on root causes of conflict such as poverty or prior abuse, and not merely focus on events associated with violent political encounters”..Falk, R. (2008). Foreword. In J. Lynch (Author), Debates in Peace Journalism (pp.v-x). Sydney: University of Sydney Press, see p.vii Through this approach peace journalism could act to “disembed” seemingly immutable official positions from the greater context of a conflict by exploring background to a conflict, challenging propaganda, and making visible official and local initiatives for peaceful conflict resolution. These two approaches differ not only in the \\"how\\" of Conflict Resolution but the \\"who\\". Lederach generally outlines a \\"middling out\\" approach where \\"the level with the greatest potential for establishing an infrastructure that can sustain the peacebuilding process over the long term appears to be the middle range\\".Lederach, 1997, p.60 He argues that grassroots approaches are generally the more fragile since their participants are often concerned with day to day issues of survival.Lederach, 1997, pp.51-52 Upper level approaches assume a high level of integration between elites and grassroots: that peace agreements reached there \\"are relevant to and capable of practical implementation at the local level\\"Lederach, 1997, p.45 Galtung on the other hand argues that upper level leaders often actually feel excluded from facilitated peace processes, with the modern focus on grassroots and civil society initiatives.Galtung, J. (2010, July 7). Self-Determination: 50 years on. Workshop presented at the 2010 biennial conference of the International Peace Research Association, Customs House, Sydney. The root of conflict is incompatible goals, pursued by parties which result in violent attitudes and behavior. It follows that \\"people are more able to discuss a root problem when they sense a solution somewhere. A glimmer of light at the end of a tunnel makes it considerably more easy[sic] to admit that we are in a tunnel\\".Galtung and Tschudi, (2001), pp.210-211 In Galtung's work, the most accessible way to influence these goals had been to work with those who officially defined them and led policy—the upper level leaders. The importance of accurate and complete Conflict Analysis for a given conflict highlights how these two approaches can be complementary. Practical Conflict Analysis is often aimed at identifying the easiest \\"peace levers\\" to pull, within a conflict to \\"unstick\\" violent inter-group relations. This contrasts with intervening in a conflict with pre-set ideas of how a resolution will be found, and with which specific level or group to begin working. Therefore Conflict Analysis may indicate which \\"entry points\\" offer the most promising chance to transform the relations between parties. And from this it will follow which approach, or combination of approaches, are likely to work from that entry point (whether it be at the grassroots, mid level or upper level or a combination). This integrative approach is summed up by peace practitioner and researcher Wendy Lambourne: \\"to rely on only one theoretical approach in peace practice risks being culturally blind\\".Personal communication, 27 June 2008 Similar approaches Sometimes also called conflict solution journalism, conflict sensitive journalism, and constructive conflict coverage. A similar approach is also found in preventive journalism, which extends the principles to social, economic, environmental or institutional problems. Peace journalism is one of several approaches and movements in journalism history, including advocacy journalism, development communication journalism, the new journalism, and public or civic journalism, which reject the universal or hegemonic claims to neutrality of professional journalism in the developed West.Thomas Hanitzsch, “Deconstructing Journalism Culture: Toward a Universal Theory,” Communication Theory 17 (2007) p.368.

He was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Rockdale for the Labor Party between 2003 and 2011. Sartor has previously been Minister for Planning, Redfern Waterloo and the Arts, and Minister for Water and Utilities in the Iemma and Carr governments. Before being elected to the New South Wales Parliament, Sartor is the second longest- serving Lord Mayor of Sydney after Clover Moore, having held the post for nearly 12 years from September 1991 to March 2003. Sartor retired from politics at the 2011 state election. Early life Sartor was born in Yenda near Griffith, New South Wales. His migrant parents named him Francesco Ernest Sartor, but he decided life would be easier if he called himself Frank. He attended St Therese's (Catholic) Primary School, Yenda, followed by Griffith High School. His mother died of melanoma when Sartor was 16. He attended the University of Sydney, residing at St John's College and graduating with a degree in chemical engineering, and a later qualification in accounting. From 1976-1983 he was employed as a chemical engineer and in management roles by Colgate-Palmolive and oil company Total Australia Ltd. Local government  Sartor served on the Council of the City of Sydney from 1984 to 2003, and was Lord Mayor of Sydney for almost 12 years, from September 1991 to April 2003. During his time on the council he served as Vice-President of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, Chairman of the Sydney Festival, Chairman of the Central Sydney Planning Committee, and Board Member of the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. During his tenure as Lord Mayor, unfounded claims were made in an effort to discredit Sartor, in relation to alleged sexual harassment, by Liberal politician, John Hannaford. These accusations were unfounded and never supported with any evidence, and were never raised in a court of law nor raised by Hannaford outside the protection of parliamentary privilege. Hannaford subsequently failed to provide any evidence to support his allegations, and was in turn investigated by the NSW Parliament for abuse of parliamentary privilege. Upon the departure of Sartor as Mayor, he was succeeded by Deputy Mayor, Lucy Turnbull, who served the remainder of the term between 2003 and 2004. Turnbull did not seek election by popular vote. New South Wales politics Sartor first sought to enter state politics in 1988, when he contested the inner-city Electoral district of McKell as an Independent, running against the endorsed Labor candidate, Sandra Nori. Sartor came second, winning 23.5% of the primary vote and 43.4% of the two-candidate preferred votehttp://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/02/1036027047540.html In 2003, Sartor joined the NSW Labor Party and entered parliament after successfully contesting the safe Labor seat of Rockdale at the 2003 State election and was subsequently sworn in as Minister for Energy and Water Utilities, Minister Assisting the Minister for Health (Cancer) and Minister for Science and Medical Research. = Anti-cancer reforms= As Assistant Health Minister, Sartor was responsible for the formation of the Cancer Institute NSW in 2003 and the introduction of smoking bans in NSW pubs and clubs in 2004, reforms he would later describe as among his proudest achievements. Many of these achievements were driven by personal tragedy and loss of his former partner, Hephzibah Tintner, and his mother, to cancer. In his final speech to parliament, Sartor broke down when talking about their loss, and how it influenced his political career. In his time as a Minister in all of his various portfolios, Sartor became known for his blunt and often crude language, but also his drive to improve cancer survival rates. However his smoking bans drew vehement criticism from publicans who argued they would harm profitability, and from anti-cancer groups which said they did not go far enough. In announcing his resignation, NSW Premier Kristina Keneally paid tribute to Mr Sartor’s work as Australia’s first cancer minister. As Minister Assisting the Minister for Health (Cancer) he oversaw restrictions on the retailing of cigarettes in NSW, including forcing them to be kept under the counter. =Water Utilities= As Minister for Water Utilities, Sartor introduced a number of sweeping changes to the water supply system, and championed water conservation, recycling and innovation in Sydney, the Illawarra and the Blue Mountains. Sartor's changes in water and energy included: oversighting the introduction of an energy and water sustainability index for new homes; implementing a government energy and water savings fund to support innovative ideas to reduce water and energy consumption; encouraging the uptake of water conservation rebates, household devices and rainwater tanks; and requiring all local councils in the Sydney metropolitan area to develop water savings plans. Sartor also oversaw the development of water infrastructure projects - including large recycling projects in Sydney. He also released the Metropolitan Water Plan which first envisaged the potential for a desalination plant to supplement Sydney's water supplies. After Sartor left the Water portfolio and became Planning Minister, despite an extremely vocal anti-desalination campaign in Kurnell during the 2007 State election, the government was returned. Desalination was Labor policy established by Sartor, whereas Opposition Liberal policy advocated the human consumption of recycled sewage. Sartor and the NSW Government rejected and ruled out human consumption of recycled effluent in Sydney. =Redfern Waterloo= In 2005 Premier Bob Carr appointed Sartor as the first Minister for Redfern Waterloo overseeing the Redfern Waterloo Authority and exercising planning powers over an area of inner Sydney. In this role he invoked the ire of the Redfern indigenous population with his rejection of a plan by the Aboriginal Housing Company to redevelop \\"The Block\\" and for suggesting on Koori Radio that the Company's chairman, Mick Mundine should \\"Get off your backside ... and bring your black arse in here to talk about it.\\" Sartor later apologised for this remark. The creation of the Redfern Waterloo portfolio was greeted with some cynicism given the long history of similar attempts to rejuvenate the area. Despite this, the Authority was able to deliver urban renewal projects for a number of derelict sites including the former Redfern Public School and a substantial redevelopment of the Australian Technology Park to incorporate headquarters for the Sydney television station Channel Seven. As part of Sartor's broader reforms in the area, the Australian Technology Park was established, and due to the reforms established by Mr Sartor, the NSW Government is able to continue active investigations into better use of disused land in the inner-west, such as the former Eveleigh railway workshops and disused industrial land. =Minister for Planning= Upon the appointment of Morris Iemma as Premier in late 2005, Sartor relinquished the Energy and Water portfolios and was sworn in as Minister for Planning. His administration was marked by a series of planning reforms to reduce the concurrence and consultation processes required for major developments in NSW. In a column in the Sydney Morning Herald, journalist and former City of Sydney Councillor Elizabeth Farrelly was scathing of Sartor for his support for advertising billboards along NSW roadways, his approval of the Anvil Hill Coal Mine, and for his moves to reduce the planning powers of local government. Sartor was re-elected as Member for Rockdale at the 2007 State election with a slightly reduced majority, and was sworn in as Minister for Planning, Minister for Redfern Waterloo and Minister for the Arts. In 2008 the NSW Greens demanded a Royal Commission into alleged links between Sartor's planning approvals and Labor Party donations by major developers. Sartor denied his planning decisions had been influenced by developer donations and threatened legal action against media outlets which repeated the claims. In 2009, Sartor was damaged by a Land and Environment Court judgment that described a decision he made to allow development at Catherine Hill Bay by a political donor, Rose Group, in exchange for conservation land as being influenced by a \\"land bribe\\". On announcing his resignation, Sartor described his time as planning minister as the most difficult of his career. On 7 September 2008 Frank Sartor was defeated in a ballot for ministerial positions and returned to the backbench with reports of internal polling by Labor revealing that Sartor was one of the government's most unpopular ministers. =Minister for Climate Change and the Environment= In December 2009, a no confidence motion was passed; and Nathan Rees stood down as Leader of NSW Labor. Sartor contested a Labor right faction ballot and narrowly lost the ballot to Kristina Keneally, who was then made Premier. Keneally returned Sartor to the NSW Cabinet; appointed to the role of Minister for Climate Change and the Environment. He was also returned to his old role of Minister Assisting the Minister for Health (Cancer), an area of personal interest and commitment.

She served as the fifth Relief Society General President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1910 until her death. She represented the state of Utah at both the National and American Women's Suffrage conventions and was president of the Utah Woman's Suffrage Association. She was the editor of the Women's Exponent for 37 years. She was a plural wife to Newel K. Whitney, then Daniel H. Wells.  Biography  =Early life= Emmeline Blanche Woodward was born on February 29, 1828 in Petersham, Massachusetts. She was the seventh child of David and Deiadama Hare Woodward. Her father died when she was four years old. She would later claim that her widowed mother inspired her to be a woman's rights advocate. When her mother remarried to Samuel Clark Jr., the Woodward family moved to North New Salem, Massachusetts. There, Emmeline spent ten years of her childhood. Religion heavily influenced her first years of life; her family attended the local village church, per New England tradition. As a child, she wrote poems and stories which she shared with her friends. She often enjoyed being in nature. Woodward was very intelligent and began studying in public school until she enrolled in the New Salem Academy. She graduated from the Academy at the age of fourteen. The revivalist movement disrupted New Salem's previous religious unity, and Woodward's community was split among different denominations. Following her mother, siblings, and a few friends, Woodward joined the LDS Church on March 1, 1842. After her baptism, she returned to the Academy and continued her schooling; she did not attend church meetings for her first year of membership. When she applied to be a teacher, discrimination against her new faith proved to be a challenge. Nevertheless, she persevered, and taught school briefly in Orange, Massachusetts, before her first marriage at the age of fifteen. =Marriages= She married 15-year-old James Harris, also a new church member, on July 19, 1843, in Vernon, Vermont. This marriage proved to be difficult for the young Emmeline; her mother-in-law disapproved of her, and she was unprepared for married life. Later, she wrote that she had been too emotional to make such an important decision and regretted marrying at such a young age. Life for Emmeline (now Harris) only became more difficult when she, along with the Harris family and a group of other New England Latter-day Saints, left for the Mormon settlement of Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1844. After a time, her mother- and father-in-law left the church and Nauvoo, so she and James were left alone. She gave birth to a son, Eugene Henri, on September 1, 1844. Unfortunately, Harris had been sick with \\"ague\\" during her pregnancy, and at six weeks old, her infant son became sick as well and did not survive. In addition to battling her own illness and the sorrow of losing her son, Emmeline said goodbye to her husband, who left to find work in St. Louis. He asked her to leave Nauvoo to live with his parents once more, but she refused. James Harris died as a sailor in the Indian Ocean and never returned to his wife. left The young Emmeline Harris returned to teaching. Through his children's attending her school, Harris met and later married Newel K. Whitney on February 24, 1845, under the Mormon practice of plural marriage. Emmeline Whitney admired her new husband and felt much safer as his wife. She left Nauvoo in 1846 and, along with the large Whitney family, left Winter Quarters, Nebraska, for Utah Territory in 1848. They traveled with the Heber C. Kimball company at the invitation of then-church president Brigham Young. During the journey, Whitney grew close to her sister-wives. She was pregnant when the company reached the Salt Lake Valley on October 8, 1848. Her first daughter, Isabel \\"Belle\\" Whitney, was born in the back of the same wagon that had carried her mother across the country; Emmeline later recounted, \\"our poor wagons and tents were the only homes we had.\\" After a Whitney family home was constructed, her second daughter, Melvina Whitney, was born on August 18, 1850. Unfortunately, this good news was followed in short order by her second husband's unexpected death. Emmeline Whitney deeply mourned his passing. By age 22, she had been widowed twice. Newel Whitney's death in 1850 prompted her to begin teaching school once more, as means of providing for her daughters. She remained primarily responsible for financially supporting herself for the rest of her life. She then approached Daniel H. Wells, a friend of her late husband's and a prominent civic leader, about marriage. In 1852, she became his seventh wife. Their early marriage was distant, as Wells was heavily involved in civic and church duties and had six other families. She lived separately from Wells's other wives. She had another daughter in 1853, Emma \\"Emmie\\" Wells. When the Utah War broke out in 1857, Emmeline moved south to Provo. There, she continued to teach school. In 1859 she gave birth to her fourth daughter, Elizabeth Ann Wells, who she named after Elizabeth Ann Whitney. Though the early years of their relationship had been difficult, Daniel and Emmeline Wells became fond and loving companions later in life. She did not regret or doubt her participation in polygamy. Daniel Wells passed away on March 24, 1891. By the end of her life, she had been widowed three times. Contributions September 15, 1880 issue of the Woman's Exponent = Woman's Exponent = > \\"The aim of the paper has always been to assist those who needed assistance > in any or every line. ... We love women and would ever strive to uplift and > help them to attain their ideals.\\" From a young age, Emmeline Wells had been writing poetry and short stories; but her career truly blossomed with the editorials she wrote for the Woman's Exponent. Established in 1872, the periodical published news about women in the LDS church along with articles advocating for women's educational, economic, and voting rights. The Exponent became part of a nationwide network of feminist journalism, exposing Wells's voice beyond Utah. She wrote many articles about women's rights, particularly the right to run for office and the right to vote. Under the pseudonym \\"Blanche Beechwood,\\" she published 40 articles arguing fervently for suffrage, societal reform, and religious freedom. Wells became the Exponent's associate editor in 1875 when Cornelia H. Horne ended her term as business manager. Following Lula Greene Richards, Wells was the second and last editor of the periodical from 1877 to 1914. She also assumed responsibility as its publisher, business manager, and owner. As editor, she became known for her executive talents and her superb memory. She continued to publish her own essays and poems, now under the name \\"Aunt Em.\\" In response to a special request from church president Brigham Young, she wrote and compiled the life stories of many Latter-day Saint women for publication in the Exponent. Her different writing selections over the years balance feminist and romantic views, as well as her religious beliefs. The Exponent served as a space for LDS women to express their views, including those of polygamy. Near the end of her tenure as editor, Wells enlisted the help of her daughter Annie Wells Cannon as assistant editor. After her failed request to have the Exponent become the Relief Society's official publication, the suffragist periodical closed in February of 1914 with Wells's last editorial titled \\"Heartfelt Farewell.\\" Wells continued to write numerous short stories and poems, many of which were published. She later compiled her poetry into a single volume, Musings and Memories; it was so well received that she published a second edition. In 1912, she became the first Utah woman to receive an honorary degree, in literature, awarded her by Brigham Young University. = Women's suffrage and politics = alt= > \\"I believe in women, especially thinking women.\\" When women were enfranchised in Utah in 1870, Wells was among the first to vote in local elections. In 1871, women's rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony visited Utah during their tour of the western United States. Wells attended their conference and was inspired by their messages, especially as she reflected on her mother's life, as well as her own limitations relative to self-sufficiency. She wished for greater freedom and independence for her five daughters. Feminist writer Margaret Fuller also inspired Wells. Wells became an early advocate of women's rights, writing under the name \\"Blanche Beechwood\\" for the Woman's Exponent. She did not adhere to or believe in the usual role of the submissive Victorian woman. Through her anonymous submissions, she expressed her frustration with society's views of the roles of a wife. She wrote 43 essays for the Exponent and became its editor in 1877. In addition to reporting news of the Relief Society, she used the publication to support women's suffrage, as well as educational and economic opportunities for women. She was in frequent contact with women's rights leaders and other pro-suffrage editors around the nation. The publication Woman's Words brought her writing to the east coast. In order to inspire her readers to advocate for change, she wrote 57 articles arguing for more independence for women.left In 1879, Wells was appointed as a Utah representative to a suffrage convention in Washington, D.C., by national feminist leaders Stanton and Anthony. She and Zina P. Young Card were \\"the first official representatives of LDS women to a national women's conference.\\" In Washington, Wells spoke against anti-polygamy legislation, especially when it threatened to disenfranchise Utah women. She and Card met with President Rutherford B. Hayes and first lady Lucy Hayes to present their case. They also addressed the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee on the matter. Wells and Card were ridiculed for attending the convention, but Stanton defended their right to be there. In addition to these national efforts, Wells was a delegate to the 1882 Utah State Constitutional Convention, where she served on the committee on education and the committee on schedule and elections. Wells joined the National Council of Women of the United States in 1891. As early as in 1879, Wells advocated that women be granted the right to hold office in Utah Territory. In 1878, she turned down a nomination for Salt Lake County Treasurer from the People's Party because women were not eligible to hold office in the territory. In 1879 she, along with Sarah M. Kimball, urged Governor George Emery to support women holding office, which he declined. In 1880, Wells was the leading force involved in convincing Charles W. Penrose to introduce legislation to grant women the ability to hold office. She wrote that her wish to be a political representative was \\"not an aggressive act on the part of women but a progressive one which will remove the discrimination that exists among equal citizens.\\" For 30 years, Wells linked LDS women with national suffrage organizations. Wells gathered signatures from women in Utah to appeal to Washington, D. C., for a constitutional amendment that would grant women the right to vote. She also remained life-long friends with Stanton and Anthony as she represented Utah in the national battle for suffrage. For nearly thirty years she represented Utah women in the National Woman Suffrage Association and the National and International Councils of Women. In 1893, Wells was elected president of the Utah Territorial Women's Suffrage Association. As such, she represented the National Council at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago as a speaker, session conductor, and exhibit organizer. She also traveled to Atlanta in 1895 to represent Utah at the annual NAWSA conference. Wells was also involved in the ultimately successful effort to restore suffrage to Utah women in the 1896 Utah state constitution. In 1899, she was invited by the International Council of Women to speak in London as a representative of the United States. A year before her death, Wells was able to see the passing of the 19th Amendment. After Utah gained statehood, Wells did run for election. In a much-publicized election, the 66-year-old Wells stood as one of several \\"at large\\" Republican candidates for state senator from Salt Lake County. Martha Hughes Cannon, a physician and former employee at the Women's Exponent, was one of five Democrats running for the office. On November 3, 1896, Cannon defeated the field and became the first woman ever elected as a state senator in the United States. = Church service = Wells while president of the Relief Society Much of her involvement in women's rights movements, she felt, had been inspired by her involvement in the LDS Church's women's organization, the Relief Society. For several years Wells served as its corresponding secretary, and as such was responsible for planning its 1892 jubilee celebration. Wells was then selected as general secretary for the Relief Society by Eliza R. Snow and served for twenty-two years in the position under succeeding presidents. In her youth in Nauvoo, Wells briefly knew Joseph Smith, founder of the church. In 1905, as Relief Society Secretary, she wrote the following to the young women of the church: Wells was appointed by Brigham Young in 1876 to head a church-based grain- saving program, and managed the church-wide program until the beginning of World War I. In 1919, Wells received a personal visit in her Salt Lake City home from U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who presented her with a commendation for selling the collected wheat to the government for the war effort. Under her leadership, 200,000 bushels had been saved for this time of shortage. Wells' grave marker Wells was called as the Relief Society's general president in 1910 at the age of 82. She served for eleven years, administering service issues related to the world war and dealing with issues relating to growth and administrative expansion. She sought to lead the organization as Joseph Smith had originally organized it. To her sorrow, the Relief Society Board declined to continue their support of the Women's Exponent, and the publication closed in 1914. Poor health led her to be released in 1921, at the age of 93. Wells died three weeks later and was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery. Her first counselor Clarissa S. Williams succeeded her as Relief Society general president. Her funeral was held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, making her the second woman ever to receive that honor. Wells authored the text of the Latter-day Saint hymn \\"Our Mountain Home So Dear\\", which is hymn number 33 in the church's 1985 English-language hymnal. A bust of Wells, inscribed \\"A Fine Soul Who Served Us\\", is found in the rotunda of the Utah State Capitol. The bust was funded through the efforts of women's groups in Utah, including the feminist community, LDS women's groups, and women's groups from other church organizations and was made posthumously as a tribute to Wells. She is the only woman to receive this honor.

Biography Stone began his career as an assistant recording engineer at Abbey Road Studios in England. While still a teenager, Stone worked on some sessions for The Beatles' Beatles For Sale (1964). Later, he became a runner at Trident Studios, then worked his way up to tape operator and assistant engineer. In 1974, Stone began a long relationship with Queen when he worked with Queen's then producer, Roy Thomas Baker, to engineer the unique vocal layering for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". Following Baker's departure as Queen's producer, the band hired Stone as their engineer for his expertise in over-dubbing vocals. By the early eighties, Stone had produced popular top-selling albums for both Asia and Journey. Stone was scheduled to oversee the re-mastering of the Queen catalogue when he died in 2002. Queen's Brian May wrote of Stone in a eulogy: \\"Mike's production style of big chorus building and hitting hard, the ability to treat vocals uniquely, and find space in a recording have influenced a generation of young producers.\\" Stone's work productivity was limited in later years by an alcohol problem, and he died from complications of it.

Robert Henry Wynyard (24 December 1802 - 6 January 1864) was a New Zealand colonial administrator, serving at various times as Lieutenant Governor of New Ulster Province, Administrator of the Government, and was the first Superintendent of Auckland Province. Early life He was born in Windsor Castle to William Wynyard, Colonel of the 5th Regiment of Foot and Equerry to King George III. Robert was educated in Dunmow, Essex and joined the British Army as an ensign in the 85th (Duke of York's Own Light Infantry) Regiment, transferring in 1826 to the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot. He served in Ireland from 1828 to 1841 on the staff of the adjutant general, and was promoted to major in 1841. He returned to England in 1842 and was appointed Lieutenant-colonel in command of the 58th Regiment.  New Zealand  When the regiment was posted to Sydney, Australia in 1844 Wynyard was sent on to New Zealand with 200 men to take part in the Flagstaff War against Hone Heke and Kawiti. Wynyard was one of the party who stormed Ruapekapeka on 11 January 1846 and in recognition of his services he was created CB later that year. In December 1846 Wynyard returned to New Zealand to command the forces there until 1858 and was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1854. When a fire broke out in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1858, eventually destroying an entire city block, Wynyard was personally on the scene directing the men of the 58th Regiment in firefighting efforts. = Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster = From 26 April 1851 to 7 March 1853, Wynyard was Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster, a province of New Zealand encompassing much of the North Island. He replaced George Dean Pitt, who had died in office. During his term of office, he persuaded the local chiefs Ngāti Tamaterā and Ngāti Raupunga to allow gold mining in the province. The office was abolished when New Zealand was divided into several smaller provinces under the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. = Superintendent of Auckland Province = Wynyard elected Superintendent of the new Auckland Province on 12 July 1853 and held office until 5 January 1855. Wynyard's election to the office was controversial, as he was in charge of the colonial armed forces at the time, and effectively deputy to the Governor. The Colonial Office, on learning that Wynyard had been elected to the office of superintendant, demanded he resign from the role. = Administrator of Government = Wynyard served for two periods (3 January 1854 to 6 September 1855 and 3 October 1861 to December 1861) as Administrator of the Government, in each case between the recall of one Governor and the arrival of the next. Wynyard opened the 1st New Zealand Parliament on 24 May 1854. He was quickly confronted by the demands of the new Parliament that responsible government be granted immediately; on 2 June the House of Representatives passed a resolution, sponsored by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, to that effect. Wynyard refused, stating that the Colonial Office made no mention of responsible government in its dispatches. The appointed Executive Council advised Wynyard against implementing responsible government, and in the meantime, he sent a dispatch to London requesting clarification. Wynyard then offered to add some elected members of parliament to the Executive Council, and appointed James FitzGerald, Henry Sewell and Frederick Weld to the council. The compromise worked for a few weeks, but on 1 August Parliament demanded complete power to appoint ministers. Wynyard refused, and all three MPs resigned from the council. In response, Wynyard prorogued Parliament for two weeks. On 31 August he appointed Thomas Forsaith, Jerningham Wakefield and James Macandrew to the Executive Council, but when Parliament met again it moved a motion of no confidence in the members. Parliament met on 8 August 1855, by which time Wynyard had received instructions from the Colonial Office to introduce responsible government. The new Governor, Sir Thomas Gore Browne, arrived on 6 September 1855 and relieved Wynyard of his duties. He resumed his military career and belonged to the 58th Regiment. On 28 January 1858, Wynyard was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council. He resigned on 3 November of that year, as the 58th Regiment was recalled to England. Wynyard's second term as Administrator in 1861 was much less eventful. Filling in between Gore Browne and Sir George Grey, he governed New Zealand for a short period with the advice of responsible Ministers, under Premier William Fox.  Cape Colony  He acted for Sir George Grey as Governor of Cape Colony twice, from 1859 to 1860 and from 1861 to 1862.  Later life  Wynyard served as Colonel of the 98th Regiment of Foot from 1863 until his death. He died in Bath, England, in 1864. He had married in Malta in 1826 Anne Catherine McDonell, daughter of Hugh McDonell, the British consul general at Algiers. They had four sons.

Background The Kagerō-class destroyers were outwardly almost identical to the preceding light cruiser- sized , with improvements made by Japanese naval architects to improve stability and to take advantage of Japan’s lead in torpedo technology. They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun .

Operational history Shortly after commissioning, Kuroshio was assigned to participate in the 16th Annual Maneuvers of the Combined Fleet. On her return, at 1800 hours on 23 June 1941, she collided with the destroyers and in Bungo Channel resulting in a month of repairs at Kure Naval Arsenal. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kuroshio, was assigned to Destroyer Division 15 (Desdiv 15), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Palau, as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier in the invasion of the southern Philippines and minelayer . She suffered minor damage on 23 December due to a strafing attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers. In early 1942, Kuroshio participated in the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting the invasion forces for Menado, Kendari and Ambon in January, and the invasion forces for Makassar, Timor and Java in February. On 8 February, she rescued survivors from Natsushio and on 5 March assisted the destroyer in sinking a Royal Navy minelayer. At the end of March, she returned with from Staring-baai in Sulawesi to Sasebo. At the end of April, Kuroshio deployed from Kure to assist in the occupation of the Cagayan Islands near Palawan in early May, and then returned with the damaged aircraft carrier from Manila to Kure on 17 May. In early June, Kuroshio deployed from Saipan as part of the troopship escort for the Battle of Midway. In mid-June, Kuroshio was assigned as escort for cruisers in projected further Indian Ocean raids, but the operation was cancelled by the time she reached Mergui in Burma, and she was reassigned as escort for the cruisers and to Balikpapan and the Solomon Islands. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons of 24 August she was part of Admiral Kondō’s Advance Force, but was not in combat. During September, Kuroshio was used for patrols between Truk and Guadalcanal, and in October began operations as a “Tokyo Express\\" high speed troop transport to Guadalcanal. These operations continued to mid-February 1943. During the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October, she was assigned to escort the aircraft carrier . Kuroshio was also at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November, during which one of her torpedoes may have hit the American cruiser . On 21 February, Kuroshio returned to Kure for repairs, together with Jun'yō, and returned on 10 April to Truk together with the aircraft carriers and . At the end of April, she was at Shortland Island, and reassigned to troop transport runs.

It was written in 1937, around the same time she was writing Death on the Nile. It is set in Ancient Egypt, and followed the exploits of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhnaton, his wife Nefertiti and his successor Tutankhaton (who would take the name Tutankhamun when he became Pharaoh). In writing the play, Christie was assisted by the eminent Egyptologist, Stephen Glanville,Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. p. 226. Collins, 1984. who was a friend of both her and her husband, Max Mallowan. In her 1977 autobiography, Christie confessed that she never thought that the play would be produced but that she simply enjoyed writing plays or writing something different from that which she was used to.Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography. p. 471. Collins, 1977. There is no record of any serious attempt to get the play staged once it had been written, but Charles Osborne, in his book The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie puts forward the theory that the publishers thought it not commercial, and was not what the public expected of Agatha Christie, who was seen at the time as purely a writer of Crime Fiction. In May 1972, Christie came across the manuscript, and sent it to her publisher in view of the interest in ancient Egypt prompted by the Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition which ran at the British Museum from 30 March until 30 September of that year, although she admitted that it would be an expensive production to stage. She made minor revisions to her 1937 manuscript and asked that it be published;Morgan. pp. 370–371) however there were still major differences between events in the play and what was then known of this time in Egyptian history (such as Akhnaton now being known to have a second wife called Kiya). The play was published by Collins in May 1973. A new, hardcover, facsimile edition of the play was issued in 2009. The play has been used by some amateur groups and repertory theatres, but is seldom performed. Aside from the commercial issues of the subject matter, the play requires eleven scene changes and over twenty speaking parts. Synopsis =Act One= Scene 1 – The Great Courtyard of the Royal Palace of Amenhotep III in the City of No Amon (Thebes): A delegation of Syrians arrive at the palace bringing the shrine of the goddess Ishtar of Nineveh with them in hope that it cures Pharaoh Amenhotep of his illness. The audience is introduced to the High Priest of Amon, Meriptah, and a young soldier Horemheb. Meriptah is loyal to himself, his polytheistic religion of Amon, his country and his Pharaoh, somewhat in that order, whereas Horemheb is a simpler though more honourable man for having equal loyalty to his country and his Pharaoh and through him his religion. Queen Tiye (called Tyi in the play) greets the delegation together with her son, Akhnaton, who is described as a “fragile- looking boy with intelligent eyes”. He stays behind and meets Horemheb. Akhnaton is revealed to the audience as an artist, poet and mystic who believes in a world where all men are free and fighting will end through love. He also recognises the goodness in Horemheb, asks for and receives his allegiance. As the scene ends, Meriptah reveals that the Amenhotep has died and that Akhnaton is now Pharaoh. Scene 2 – A Room in the Palace (Three years later): Tyi is regent of Egypt until Akhnaton comes of age. The young man shows little interest in ruling as his father had done and antagonises Meriptah. It is revealed that it was Tyi who instilled in Akhnaton a dislike of the religion of Amon and a reverence of Ra when he was a child. In conversation with another priest, Ay, Akhnaton realises his destiny and that he is the son of Ra. He gives orders that his barge be prepared for a voyage down the Nile to a spot where he will build a new city to the glory of Ra. Nefertiti is introduced. She and her husband Akhnaton have a genuine love for each other and their only child, a daughter. Tyi warns Nefertiti that she must persuade her husband not to oppose the cult of Amon to any great degree, knowing the danger that such a move would present to him, but she is too loyal to her husband to go against his wishes. Nefertiti's calculating sister, Nezzemut asks her dwarf servant, Para, for a vision of the future through sand divining. Para foretells that Horemheb will one day be Pharaoh and that Nezzemut will be his Queen. Scene 3 – A bank of the Nile, 300 miles below Thebes (A month later): On his royal barge, Akhnaton decides on the spot for his new city of Horizon (at the site of modern-day Amarna). =Act Two= Scene 1 – A bank of the Nile in the City of No Amon (eight years later): The populace of the old city are revealed as being angry with the changes that Akhnaton has brought to their country with his attack on the old religion. Meriptah overhears their complaints as he waits for an acolyte, Ptahmose to arrive from Horizon with news of events there. Ptahmose reveals that Tutankhaton is betrothed to Akhnaton's second daughter, Horemheb is now commander of the armies of Egypt and that Ptahmose has an ally in the cunning Nezzemut. Meriptah's plan is the restoration of the old religion and his own power and riches. Bust of Nefertiti from Berlin's Altes Museum Scene 2 – The King's Pavilion in the City of Horizon (six months later): Akhnaton is revealed as the sculptor of the famous bust of Nefertiti (see right). They now have five daughters. Tyi is no longer regent and Akhnaton rules in his own right. Nefertiti dislikes Horemheb, thinking that he dislikes her but Akhnaton's love for the soldier and belief in him is as great as ever. Horemheb himself is worried at the signs of dissent that he sees in Egypt but Akhnaton brushes these worries aside, obsessed with the perfection of the beauty of his new city. Tyi arrives, old and ill. She is deeply concerned about the feelings of the people and particularly the way in which Akhnaton's tax-gatherers rob them of their money. Horemheb is an ally of her worries and promises to watch over Akhnaton. Tyi misses nothing and warns Horemheb to be careful of Nezzemut. Akhnaton receives foreign tributes but declines to impress them with the grandeur they expect. Tyi is scornful that they will see this as a sign of weakness. She recognises Ptahmose in the crowd and tries to warn her son of the spies in his midst but dies before she can do so. Scene 3 – Horemheb's apartments in the city of Horizon (a year later): Tutankhaton is a good friend of Horemheb and takes instruction from him in the soldier's arts. Two Syrian emissaries arrive to speak with Horemheb. Meriptah has smuggled himself into Horizon and speaks with Tutankhaton and Horemheb, attempting to sow discord over the new religion. News is brought of rebellion in the vassal states of Egypt and riots within its cities. Akhnaton is convinced that the religion of Amon is to blame and issues decrees to wipe all traces of him from Egypt – even from the tombs of the dead. His supporters are just as horrified as his enemies but Akhnaton is determined. =Act Three= Scene 1 – The King's Pavilion (three years later): Akhnaton is weak and ill, but still believing in the goodness of men, he is still deaf to the pleas of Horemheb who begs to be allowed to deal with the insurrectionists across Egypt and its provinces. Nezzemut tries to convince Horemheb that the Pharaoh is mad. Horemheb, for the best motives, tries to persuade Akhnaton to allow Tutankhaton to rule with him. Akhnaton is now set on a course of monotheism and is determined to obliterate all trace of all gods except Ra from Egypt. This persuades Horemheb that Nezzemut is right and that Akhnaton has lost his sanity. Scene 2 – A Street in No Amon (six months later): Horemheb and Meriptah hear the people as they mourn the dead who have lost their lives through famine, plague and attack from outside. Horemheb is determined that Egypt will rise again. Scene 3 – A room in the High Priest's House (the same day): Meriptah, Horemheb, Tutankhaton and Nezzemut plan Akhnaton's overthrow. Horemheb obtains a promise that Akhnaton's life will be spared and that he will be allowed to live with honour for the rest of his life in Horizon. However, Meriptah and Nezzemut plan separately: Tutankhaton will be allowed to live for only a couple of years before he dies and Nezzemut can rule, and Akhnaton must die as Horemheb still has a love for the Pharaoh. Nezzemut will arrange for his death, but tells Meriptah that Nefertiti – who she truly loves – must be unharmed. Scene 4 – A Room in the Palace of the city of Horizon (a month later): One tragedy after another falls on Akhnaton as he hears of further rebellions across Egypt, as Horemheb tells him that he no longer supports him, that his son-in-law Tutankhaton has turned against him and that the supposedly finished cult of Amon has risen again. He falls into a hysterical fever at these events, prompting Nezzemut to suggest that Para make one of her famous brews (i.e. poison) to calm him. Nefertiti feeds the brew to Akhnaton and is about to drink some herself when a horrified Nezzemut stops her. Nefertiti realises that she has been betrayed and has been tricked into poisoning her husband. Horemheb arrives and is distraught at the events he has caused. Akhnaton dies and Nefertiti herself drinks the brew… =Epilogue= A Captain reads out a proclamation to a group of stonemasons. The religion of Amon is to be restored to Egypt.

AllMusic called the song \\"a virtual link between the slightly progressive work on songs such as 'California Girls' and the then-quantum leap taken by Wilson on Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations'\\". Lyrics \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew\\" follows familiar territory as the Beach Boys' 1964 outtake \\"All Dressed Up for School\\", telling the story of a guy who reacquaints with a girl from his past who has now grown up and catches his eye. According to Mark Dillon, some speculate that the song was written about Brian's then-wife Marilyn Wilson. Mike Love reportedly had a hand in the lyrics. In the 1990s, his lawsuit for officially recognized writing contributions failed to include \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew\\". Recording The song was recorded shortly after Brian Wilson completed Beach Boys' Party! in between sessions for the Pet Sounds tracks \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"You Still Believe in Me\\". It was initially labelled \\"Carol K\\" on its session tape box, a reference to the song's bassist, Carol Kaye. The track has drawn comparisons with the work of contemporary Burt Bacharach, whom Wilson admired. In 1995, Wilson expressed, \\"It was a fine song, except the intro is the only good part of it, and the rest didn't sound so good. I thought the song in itself sucked. I didn't like the harmonies, I thought they were sour and off-key.\\" Despite this, he later said that the song \\"should've\\" gotten more attention than it did. Its verses are \\"low-key\\" and hard-shift into a \\"blaring chorus\\", which Dillon writes, \\"foreshadows the Smile track 'Cabin Essence'\\". Release and reception It was released in November 1965 as a single 45 rpm, backed by \\"There's No Other (Like My Baby)\\", and reached #15 on the Cash Box chart and #20 on Billboard.

She was the daughter of a serf actor and musician in the troupe of a landlord called Stolypin, who in 1798 sold him to the Imperial troupe.ru: Большая биографическая энциклопедия // Репина, Надежда Васильевнаru: Биографический словарь. 2000. Верстовская Надежда Васильевнаru: Надежда Васильевна Репина-Верстовская Serf actors, once in the Imperial troupe, immediately were free people. So Nadezhda was born free. Vasily Repin became a musician in the orchestra of the Moscow Imperial troupe, and gave his daughter in 1816 at the Moscow Imperial theater college. Her musical and acting talent were noticed right away. She made her debut in several operas and vaudevilles in 1823. At this time the Moscow Imperial troupe not had its theaters – they all were burned. Performances were held in the homes of wealthy Muscovites. At the end of 1824, a rich merchant Vasily Vargin gave his house to the Moscow Imperial troupe – now this is Maly Theatre (Moscow), it was opened on 14 October 1824. At the same time, architects Andrei Mikhailov and Joseph Bové had built a new theatre on the place of the burnt theatre of Michael Maddox – now this is Bolshoi Theatre; it opened on 18 January 1825. Nadezhda Repina became the first prima donna these theaters. Her talent took all genres: opera, operetta, comedy, vaudeville, drama, tragedy. Many playwrights wrote leading roles for her in their plays (Dmitry Lensky, Aleksander Pisarev). Sergei Aksakov called her the “adornment of the Moscow stage”. She was especially successful in comedies and vaudevilles where her partner was the famous Russian actor Mikhail Shchepkin. She was a pupil and then wife of the composer Alexey Verstovsky. He wrote his operas and musical vaudevilles for her. Among Nadezhda Repina's roles: * Masha – Ivan Susanin, opera of Catterino Cavos * Zerlina – Don Giovanni, opera of Mozart * Angèle – Le domino noir, opéra comique of Daniel Auber * Yulia – Pan Tvardovsky, opera of Alexey Verstovsky * Suzanne – The Marriage of Figaro, play of Pierre Beaumarchais * Ophelia – Hamlet, play of William Shakespeare (1837; music author is a composer Alexander Egorovich Varlamov; Pavel Mochalov as Hamlet) * Luise – Intrigue and Love, play of Friedrich Schiller * Nadezhda – Askold's Grave, opera of Alexey Verstovsky * Sofia – Woe from Wit, play of Alexander Griboyedov * Liza – Lev Gurych Sinichkin (), play of Dmitry Lensky (author's version of the plot of French play Le Père de la débutante of Jean-François Bayard and Emmanuel Théaulon), with music of Alexey Verstovsky etc. The repertoire of Nadezhda Repina was huge; she sang some 100 operatic roles, not counting roles in drama performances.Aron Proujanski.

Modern view Alexey Verstovsky was not only a composer, he became the head of Music department at the Moscow Imperial troupe. He knew that would be expected large changes and, fearing that they would affect to his wife, asked without her knowledge to the Directorate for her dismissal. She knew nothing about this. Her dismissal was held in 1841. When she got it, she fainted. Nadezhda Repina and Alexey Verstovsky made the official church marriage. Her acting was over. She was 32 years old, still had many years of empty and useless life. From time to time, she continued to come backstage and helped councils of young actresses. But it was quite a different life. Her partner, actor S. Solovyov wrote that she was interested of only one thing: her acting, without it she could not live, and she was very grieved at her inaction.

Narrated by various characters, it tells the tragic love story of Philothei and Ibrahim. It also chronicles the rise of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the 'Father of the Turkish Nation'. The overarching theme of the story covers the impact of religious intolerance, over-zealous nationalism, and the war that often results. The characters are unwittingly caught up in historical tides outside of their control. The book's title is taken from a saying by one of the characters, Iskander the Potter, \\"Man is a bird without wings, and a bird is a man without sorrows.\\" The book includes a vivid and detailed description of the horrors of life in the trenches during World War I. Some of the characters are also present in the author's earlier novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Plot summary The pace of the book is languid, even slow. The story is set in Eskibahçe, a small fictional village in southwestern coastal Anatolia during the 1900s, spanning World War I and the era of Turkish nationalism. The Battle of Gallipoli takes place halfway through the novel. The book is written from several different points of view. Chapter by chapter the first person account is from the perspective of Dorsoula, or Ibrahim, or Ayse, or one of many other characters including a wealthy merchant based in Smyrna (now Izmir). All points of view are credible, even insightful at times. Characters *Philothei  Most beautiful girl of Eskibahçe *Ibrahim the Goatherd  Philothei's long standing admirer and betrothed, who becomes crazy upon his return from the war *Abdulhamid Hodja  The local imam. *Ayse  Abdulhamid Hodja's wife. *Charitos  Father of Philothei and Mehmetçik. *Drosoula  Philothei's best friend.

He is also the youngest son of Iskander the Potter. He fights for the Ottoman Empire in World War I and against the Greeks during the subsequent invasion of Anatolia. After returning home, he loses his right arm when his father (unknowingly) shoots him. As a result, he cannot carry on his father's vocation as potter, and so becomes Karatavuk the Letter-Writer, acting as town scribe. *Leyla  Rustem Bey's Circassian mistress, who is in fact Greek. *Mehmetçik (Turkish for 'Red Robin')  Philothei's younger brother and Karatavuk's best friend.

Further information  The book was shortlisted for the 2004 Whitbread Novel Award and the 2005 Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia Region, Best Book). Kayaköyü, the fictional Eskibahçe Although fiction, the setting of Eskibahçe is based upon Kayaköy (Greek: Levissi Λεβισσι) village near Fethiye (coordinates: 36.574128, 29.088058), the ruins of which still exist today. Once a thriving Greek village, this town of over one thousand houses, two churches, fourteen chapels, and two schools, was completely deserted in 1923 when the Greek inhabitants living there, along with a vast number of Greeks living throughout Turkey were deported to Greece through a massive government mandated population exchange between the two countries following the Turkish war of independence. Historically, Turks and Greeks had lived together in this region for centuries, the Turks as farmers in the Kaya valley and the Greeks living on the hillside dealing in crafts and trades. A Greek presence in this region goes back centuries. Since then, the village of Kayakoy, as it is called in Turkish, or Karmylassos, as it was called in Greek, which had been continually inhabited since at least the 13th century, has stood empty and crumbling, with only the breeze from the mountains and mist from the sea blowing through its empty houses and streets. Attempts by the Turkish government to get Turks deported from Greece to inhabit the village failed, and eventually, in the 1950s, the roofs of all the houses were removed.

He won the 2009 Superliga championship with F.C. Copenhagen. Würtz has played 12 matches for the Denmark national football team from 2005 to 2007, as well as 52 matches for various youth national teams, and he was named 2001 Danish Under-19 Player of the Year. As of 21 May 2018 Würtz is the most capped player in the history of the Danish Superliga with 434 matches played. Club career Born in Skive, Würtz played his youth years at hometown club Skive IK. He made his senior debut for the club in the secondary Danish 1st Division league. In November 2001, he signed a three-and-a-half year contract with Aalborg Boldspilklub (AaB) in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship.Henrik Niss, \\"Fra Skive til AaB til Skive\\", Politiken, 20 November 2001 Würtz was subsequently loaned out to Skive for six months, where he finished the 2001–02 season. He joined AaB in July 2002, and instantly became a mainstay in the first team starting line-up. AaB profile In his debut season in the Danish Superliga 2002-03 season, he missed only one match, as he played 32 of 33 league games. In his first three seasons at AaB, Würtz only missed four of 99 Superliga games. On 6 July 2007, Würtz moved to league rivals F.C. Copenhagen, signing a five-year-long contract with the defending Danish champions. The transfer fee was reported to be around 3 to 4 million Danish kroner (€500,000). In his first time at Copenhagen, Würtz suffered injuries and the lack of playing time caused his form to dip.Lars Berendt, Thomsen og Würtz på Ligalandsholdet, Danish Football Association, 17 December 2009. In February 2009, he was loaned out to Superliga relegation battlers Vejle Boldklub. Vejle Boldklub profile He played 15 Superliga games and scored one goal for Vejle, but could not prevent the club from being relegated. As he had played one game for Copenhagen earlier in the season, Würtz had the bitter-sweet experience of both relegation and winning the championship during the 2008–09 Danish Superliga season. In July 2009, Würtz was transferred back to AaB, signing a four-year-long contract with his old club, as his Copenhagen career did not seem to improve.Jan Schrøder, Würtz vender tilbage til AaB , AaB Fodbold, 9 July 2009.

He debuted for the senior Danish national team on 2 June 2005, in a 1–0 friendly match win against Finland. He came on the pitch as a substitute for Danish team captain Jon Dahl Tomasson, and was supposed to hand over the captain's armband to Thomas Gravesen. When he approached Gravesen, he was told to take the armband himself and thus he captained the Danish national team for the final nine minutes of his debut game.

The report was written in response to a 1979 request from the African Governors of the World Bank for a paper analyzing the development problems facing African countries. It also responds to a set of policies determined by African Chiefs of State in 1980, called the Lagos Plan of Action. While the Lagos Plan endorsed inward-looking policies of African self-reliance, the Berg report advocated for outward- looking policies of increased international trade.  Synopsis  The report is historically important for having marked a shift in African countries’ economic policies towards economic liberalization. It details several policy recommendations in its plan for action, including “(1) more suitable trade and exchange-rate policies; (2) increased efficiency of resource use in the public sector; and (3) improvement in agriculture policies.” In terms of trade and exchange-rate policies, the report recommends liberalizations including “correction of overvalued exchange rates […]; improved price incentives for exports and for agriculture; lower and more uniform protection for industry; and reduced use of direct controls.” For efficient resource usage, the Berg report identifies government and parastatal agencies as being overextended, and suggests streamlining public services, in part by allowing a greater share of these to be provided by the private sector. In the area of agriculture, they propose promoting export of cash crops by reducing taxes and other unfavorable terms of trade, as well as making domestic food markets more efficient by loosening regulation and increasing the role of the private sector in inputs (such as fertilizer) and in marketing foodstuffs (e.g. deregulating food prices). The report concludes with a strong appeal to international aid organizations to support African governments as they shift towards the policies of economic liberalization recommended by the World Bank.  Reception  The recommendations contained in the World Bank's report held real significance for African political leaders, as the Bank is a major development lending agency with the power to affect the identification and design of development projects. Structural adjustment programs (SAPs) instituted by the World Bank made loans conditional on specific conditions, a strong inducement for countries to follow free-market policies. The report makes specific recommendations to donors, stating, “The level and pattern of donor assistance to a country must be determined in the framework of programs of action prepared by individual governments, which address the critical development policy issues outlined in this Report.” Explicitly advocating for “policy action and foreign assistance that are mutually reinforcing,” the report reinforces its own recommendations by leveraging loan and aid money. The Berg report generated criticism from some scholars of international development and African studies, particularly for the way it represents “the balance of responsibility for development failure.” The report prioritizes “domestic policy inadequacies” as a major cause for under-performing economies, and some have argued that the report downplays “the importance of external factors in shaping policy and performance in Sub-Saharan Africa.” In 1981, when the report was published, an important external factor was the instability of the global economy, particularly the stagflation of the 1970s, and the 1979 energy crisis.

A year given for her death is 1117. According to mentions in various literature a few centuries later, she was also Queen of Sweden as the wife of King Inge the Younger. Some historians have introduced a possibility, refuted by others, that Ragnhild's father was Alstan, a son of Folke Filbyter, and that she thus belonged to the early House of Bjelbo of subsequent Swedish and Norwegian kings. Ragnhild is said to have founded the church in Södertälje and be buried there. If she is a historical person, she probably lived during the late 11th or early 12th century, but no sources that mention her can be dated earlier than the 15th century. An epitaph in the church, probably dating from that period, was later copied by the late 17th century antiquarian Elias Palmskiöld. In various 15th century literary sources, she is claimed to have been a queen, the daughter of a certain Halsten (it is uncertain whether the king Halsten Stenkilsson is intended) and wife of either Inge the Elder or Inge the Younger (either of which would for genealogical and chronological reasons contradict her being the daughter of King Halsten). 14th and 15th century wall paintings depicting Ragnhild can be found in the churches of Börje and Viksta in Uppland, and Enånger in Hälsingland, all three in the archdiocese of Uppsala. Legacy Queen Ragnhild stylized in the arms of Södertälje 14th-century wall painting at Enånger of Queen Ragnhild Interest in Ragnhild (as in some other medieval local saints) was revived long after the Protestant Reformation through the general interest in Swedish antiquities that flourished in 17th century Sweden. In her case, the publication of Vitis aquilonia by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 had already caused a re-interpretation of the human figure in the seal of the City of Södertälje to be a stylistic depiction of Ragenilda. Her cult image includes a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusalem where she was undressed by bandits and left naked, but by angels was sent a magnificent cloak. It also mentions her marriage to King Inge and her virtues as queen, but that he left her. She could then devote herself to caring for the ill. For the introduction of Christianity in Södermanland in the decades around 1100, Ragnhild has been supposed to be one of the three instrumental people, the earlier being Saint Eskil and later Saint Botvid. Eskil's and Botvid's legends, however, were contemporary (12th century). Ragnhild is not mentioned specifically until the 1450s in the Little Rhyme Chronicles, and then in the newer preface of a 1520s reissue of the Eric Chronicle from 1335. Peringskiöld provided evidence that the original epitaph on Ragnhlid's grave, describing her as a queen, had been transcribed correctly in subsequent centuries. Obvious similarities in style between Ragnhild's epitaph and that of the early 12th century sarcophagus of St. Botvid's brother Beorn in Botkyrka have led to an additional theory of the authenticity of the former. From that epitaph: A legend about her by King Sigismund's librarian and court priest has Ragnhild brought up from childhood fearing God, then married to Inge, living an angelic life on earth, dead of old age in 1120 and buried in Södertälje. When Södertälje got a new city hall in 1965, a memorial plaque to Queen Ragnhild, authored by the town's mayor in 1753, was moved to the new building and placed in its courtroom.

The USARS was intended to enhance combat effectiveness by providing the opportunity for a regimental affiliation, thus obtaining some of the benefits of the traditional regimental system. Overview USARS was developed to include the active Army (all combat arms battalions, separate companies, batteries, and troops; all combat support (CS), combat service support (CSS), and special branches, and appropriate training base battalions) and the reserve components (the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve). It was developed to offer the opportunity for long-term identification with a regiment or corps, provide the potential for recurring assignments within a regiment or corps, provide the opportunity to further emphasize the history, customs, and traditions of the regiment or corps, and provide regiments that are structured as one or more continental United States (CONUS) units of like type linked with one or more units of like type outside the continental United States (OCONUS), or one or more units of like type located exclusively in either CONUS or OCONUS, including one or more training battalions or tactical armored cavalry or ranger regiments. USARS is also designed to provide for CS, CSS, and special branches to operate on a “whole branch” concept as a corps or special branch, carrying on the activities and traditions of a regiment, offer regimental affiliation to allow soldiers the opportunity for continuous identification with a combat arms regiment, a corps, or special branch throughout their careers. USARS provides (through regimental affiliation) different opportunities for soldiers, depending upon which combat arms regiment they choose to be affiliated with or whether they affiliate with a CS or CSS corps or special branch. In addition, the regimental affiliation process allows combat arms soldiers to select the regiment of choice (soldiers can change their affiliation at any time); provides that CS, CSS, and special branch soldiers will automatically be affiliated with their corps or special branch; specifies that all soldiers will belong to a regiment or corps; permits no limit to the number of soldiers who can be affiliated with a regiment or corps; and provides that DA civilians can automatically be affiliated with a regiment or corps by direction of the regiment or corps commander.  Combat arms  = Concept = Combat arms is a rescinded doctrinal term, though colloquially it includes air defense artillery, armor, aviation, field artillery, infantry, and special forces regiments. Combat arms soldiers may affiliate with any of the combat arms regiments consistent with their primary military occupational specialty (PMOS), specialty code, special qualification identifiers (SQI), or additional skill identifiers (ASI). Soldiers will have greater opportunities to serve recurring assignments in their regiments if regiments are chosen that have battalions in both CONUS and OCONUS locations. Since there is no ceiling on the number of soldiers who can affiliate with a particular regiment, the potential for recurring assignments to regiments is diminished where the number of affiliated soldiers exceeds the requirements. = Affiliation policy = Quoting from Chapter 3–2, page 7 of Army Regulation 600-82, U.S. Army Regimental System (note: Army Regulation 600-82 has been superseded by Army Regulation 670-1): > a.

In these tales he is the victim of the pranks of Bruno and Buffalmacco. He becomes a recurring character in Renaissance literature, especially in Italy. Appearances in The Decameron In each of the tales in which Calandrino is a character (VIII, 3; VIII, 6; IX, 3; IX, 5), he is portrayed as a simpleton who believes in the folk magic of the time period. In the first tale (VIII, 3), the three painters hunt for heliotropes, and Calandrino believes that by finding one he is rendered invisible. Bruno and Buffalmacco, his friends and fellow painters, pretend they don't see him and kick rocks at him all the way back to Florence, where he arrives bruised. In the second tale (VIII, 6) Bruno and Buffalmacco subject him to a medieval version of a polygraph test. According to common belief at the time, a person who is lying wouldn't be able to swallow the prepared bread and cheese when under examination. However, Bruno and Buffalmacco sour the cheese with dog ginger, a very bitter herb which Calandrino then spits out. This convinces his friends that he is lying about a pig of his being stolen (which in reality they had taken). Calandrino is convinced that he is pregnant in story IX, 3. To give him a painless miscarriage he takes a potion that is specially prepared by his friends, Bruno and Buffalmacco. Finally, tale IX, 5 is a story in which Boccaccio uses the Calandrino character to ridicule the folk magic of his time period. To gain a woman's affections, Calandrino casts a spell and prepares a potion from a scroll supplied by Bruno. The potion contains all sorts of absurd ingredients and the scroll is filled with gibberish. When his wife discovers his intentions, she beats Calandrino. Calandrino in the arts Calandrino became the main character in several artistic works, including: * Bernardo Dovizi's play La Calandra (also, known as Il Calandro and La Calandria, 1507) - play * Giovanni Alberto Ristori, «Calandro» (1726), libretto - Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino - opera * Antonio Sacchini, «L'avaro deluso, o Don Calandrino» (1778) - opera * Johann Georg Schürer, «Calandro» (1748) - opera * Giuseppe Gazzaniga, «Il Calandrino» (1771) - opera * Domenico Cimarosa, Il ritorno di Don Calandrino (1778)- opera * Le avventure di Calandrino e Buffalmaco (1975) - mini-series * Paul Calandrino, The Nincompoop (2007) - play Historical identity Calandrino was a historical person, an Italian Renaissance painter named Nozzo di Perino who lived in the fourteenth century. Whether he really was the simpleton portrayed by Boccaccio in his work is unknown, but common belief is that he was a bit gullible. It is unclear whether this belief arose because of the popularity of the Decameron, or whether it was already popular belief when Boccaccio wrote the tales.
