History  Between 1994‚Äì95, joint archaeological research was undertaken by Centre for Archaeological Research of Malaysia and Sabah Museum team at the hill. Based on the findings from two seasons of excavations until the base of the undisturbed cultural deposits for about a period of five weeks at two volcanic outcrops near the hill summit, the subsequent layers contained undisturbed artefacts. A broad range of archaeological materials were recovered during the excavations which include large quantities of potsherds, chert, agate and obsidian stone tools, polished stone adzes, a stone barkcloth beater as well as some shell and bone artefacts. Abundant of food remains also discovered, mostly being the marine molluscs, fish bones and some terrestrial animal bones. The site has been identified as the largest pottery making factory in Southeast Asia during the Neolithic period. The hill slopes are littered with numerous pottery shards with various patterns dating 3,000 BP. An ethno- archaeological study shows that such pottery making is still practised by the Bajau community in Semporna until this day.

Del Valle obtained a land grant from the Mexican government, which led to the founding of Galveston, Texas and several towns in Travis County, including Del Valle, which is named in his honor. In 1825, he served as president of the Congreso Constituyente of the state of Coahuila y Tejas, counselor to governor Victor Blanco, and as the arbitrator in a feud between the S√°nchez Navarro and Elizondo families. Land grant The Del Valle land grant was originally an empresario grant purchased by Benjamin Milam in 1825, in hopes of establishing a mining colony. In 1832, the Mexican government canceled Milam's grant due to an insufficient supply of new citizens for their colony in Texas, following a new law passed in 1830. In 1832, the 10 league grant was transferred to Del Valle, who lived and worked in Monclova at the time. In 1835, Samuel May Williams acquired ten leagues (about ) of the grant from Del Valle and sold the land to Michel Branamour Menard, who established the town that would become the present-day Galveston, Texas.

A relentless innovator and novel risk-taker, he has been called \\"the father of modern insurance\\", \\"the maker of modern Lloyd's\\",Brown, Antony. Cuthbert Heath: The Maker of Modern Lloyds. David & Charles, 1980. and \\"the father of non-marine insurance at Lloyd's\\", having through his actions transformed Lloyd's from a British marine-only insurer to the complex and varied international general and specialty-risk insurer it is today, and having cemented Lloyd's sterling reputation, as a reliable insurer which promptly and fully paid all valid claims, in the U.S. and throughout the world. Heath is credited with originating the following forms of insurance: burglary, jeweller's block, all-risks policies, loss-of-profits after fire, bankers' blanket bond, credit-risk, employer's liability, workmen's compensation, smallpox-if-vaccinated, excess-of-loss, air-raid, earthquake, and hurricane. He did pioneering and detailed research and risk-assessment for insurance he originated, in particular for earthquake and hurricane probability. He also cemented Lloyd's reputation in the U.S. and worldwide by his immediate response to the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire: \\"Pay all of our policyholders in full, irrespective of the terms of their policies.\\" In addition, he originated the solvency audit for members of Lloyd's syndicates, which became mandatory at the company. Heath engaged in numerous civilian services during World War I, including giving his mansion Anstie Grange to the War Office for use as an officer's hospital, for which he was appointed an OBE. Early life and education Cuthbert Heath was born in 1859 in Forest Lodge near Southampton, England. He was the fourth of seven children of Captain Leopold Heath, a Royal Navy officer who achieved the rank of Vice Admiral, became the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In childhood Cuthbert contracted partial deafness, which prevented him from joining the military as three of his four brothers did. Heath was tutored privately until the age of eight, and then attended Temple Grove School in East Sheen. He attended Brighton College through 1874, and afterwards, beginning at the age of 16, spent a year in France and a nearly year in Germany, learning French and German. Career =Entry at Lloyd's and early innovations 1878‚Äì1905= In 1878, at the age of 18, Heath became a clerk at Henry Head & Co., a firm of brokers and underwriters at Lloyd's of London. In 1880, at the age of 21, he was elected an underwriting member of Lloyd's, with the backing of a ¬£7,000 deposit provided by his father,The Journal of European Economic History. Banco di Roma, 1988. p. 500. and he began underwriting for himself two years later, in 1882. Lloyd's at the time was a marine insurance-only insurer, so Heath was a marine underwriter at first. In 1885 he reinsured Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society's fire risks, thereby reviving fire insurance at Lloyd's, which had previously been discontinued due to high taxation rates. He started Lloyd's first specifically non-marine syndicate at Lloyd's in 1885. Heath thereafter became renowned for increasing, and innovating in, Lloyd's non- marine insurance business, which eventually resulted in changing the face of Lloyd's forever. Heath's innovations in the insurance industry began in the late 1880s. By 1889 someone insuring a house for fire had asked Heath if he could also insure it for burglary, which had never been done before. Heath's reply was reportedly a now-famous \\"Why not?\\", which became his motto going forward; his principle was \\"Any risk is insurable at the right price.\\" Around the same time he also began insuring the diamond market, resulting in his creating a \\"jeweller's block\\" policy for merchants that covered jewels in transit and on the premises, and an \\"all risks\\" jewellery policy for consumers that covered loss or theft. In the late 1880s Heath also invented and offered insurance for loss of profits after a fire, also known as business interruption insurance. This controversial move created a major uproar, and he was summoned by the Chairman of Lloyd's Fire Offices Committee and asked why he was \\"ruining fire insurance\\". Heath ignored the controversy. In 1890, in order to increase his business Heath established a firm of insurance brokers, C. E. Heath & Co., which became a substantial independent broking firm with considerable overseas business. In 1890 Heath also wrote the first American risk ever in Lloyd's non-marine market. In 1895 he wrote the first earthquake insurance policy in the U.S. Heath also invented bankers' blanket bond insurance. Heath was the first Lloyd‚Äôs underwriter to accumulate detailed probability-of-loss statistics, becoming a specialist in the risks he undertook. In order to price catastrophe insurance, he initially collected maps of 100 years of hurricane paths in the West Indies, and made detailed notes in a little black rating book which acquired renown. He did the same for earthquakes, paying to have maps created of past earthquakes in India, and finding records of past earthquakes in South America, China, and the West Indies. He also lent his black book to competitors so they would not naively undercut his rates. In the 1890s Heath also developed credit risk insurance, with the stipulation that the insured had to bear some part of the risk in order to insure prudence and due diligence on the part of the creditor. He established the \\"8 Principles of Credit Insurance\\", became the first Chairman of the Trade Indemnity Company, and founded the Credit Insurance Association. He also pioneered employer's liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance. In 1894, faced with a need for greater capacity for his non-marine insurance business, Heath established the Excess Insurance Company. With an initial capitalisation of ¬£5,000, it was used as a reinsurance backing for his syndicate. The original stated purpose of the firm was \\"to write marine, fire and accident [liability] business and reinsurance\\". During the 1901‚Äì1902 smallpox epidemic in London, he pioneered smallpox insurance, reducing the premium by 75% if the individual was vaccinated. Prior to the 20th century Lloyd's only secured its marine insurance risks. In 1902 Heath finally persuaded Lloyd's to require security deposits for non-marine business as well; this was implemented in 1903. Heath was also the first to introduce the idea of an audit at Lloyd's; because of the dearth of security for non-marine risks, he required a strict audit of the members of his syndicate, beginning in 1903. =1906 San Francisco earthquake and aftermath= On 18 April 1906 a major earthquake hit San Francisco, and the resulting fires destroyed over 80% of the city, killed thousands of people, and left half of the population homeless. Misled by local propaganda as to earthquake likelihood, few residents of San Francisco had bought earthquake insurance, but they had bought fire insurance. In the wake of the devastating fires following the earthquake, many insurance companies fought paying their policyholders, often by quibbling over causality (since the insurance was not for earthquakes), or paying only 75% of the amounts due. This led to many lawsuits from policyholders. At least 14 insurers went bankrupt, and some insurers ‚Äì mostly German and Austrian ‚Äì simply disappeared and denied all coverage. Heath and his syndicate had insured aggressively in San Francisco, covering about 20% of the total policyholders there. Nevertheless he immediately cabled his San Francisco agent a now-legendary instruction: Lloyd's paid out a staggering $50 million, the equivalent of more than $1 billion in 2010 currency. Heath's action, however, cemented Lloyd's reputation in the U.S. as an insurer that promptly and fully paid all valid claims, and led to a great increase in Lloyd's business there and eventually elsewhere as well. The United States soon became Lloyd's largest market. The catastrophe came at a difficult time for the insurance industry, as the preceding years had left many insurers reeling from several other costly disasters, including the 1903 Chicago fire in the Iroquois Theatre which killed 600 people, the 1904 fire on the steamship General Slocum in Manhattan's East River which killed 1,021 people, and the 1904 Great Baltimore Fire which caused losses of $90 million. Additionally, a few months after the San Francisco earthquake and fires there were further catastrophic earthquakes and fires in Valparaiso, Chile and in Kingston, Jamaica. By 1907 Heath therefore devised excess-of-loss reinsurance, to provide insurers with the protection they needed against catastrophe losses like the San Francisco claims. These reinsurance policies paid out only when the loss was above a certain threshold, and put a cap on payments; they also involved layering and retrocession, thereby inventing vertical reinsurance. An additional consequence of the San Francisco earthquake and fire was that in 1908 Lloyd's as a whole adopted Heath's model of a strict and compulsory annual audit of all members' accounts. All underwriters were required to provide certificates of solvency from approved auditors, and premiums were held in trust accounts for the payment of claims. These practices became the cornerstone of Lloyd's solidity for the rest of the 20th century. =Subsequent career 1907‚Äì1939= Heath sold the first Lloyd's auto insurance policy in 1907, for American drivers and their cars. In 1912 he sold the first fleet coverage, to a meat-packing company in Chicago. In 1911 he was elected to Lloyd's Committee, its governing body, and served on it through 1915. Also in 1911, non-marine insurance at Lloyd's, which he had initiated and so greatly expanded, was given official legal recognition and status, via the Parliamentary Lloyd's Act of 1911. In December 1911 The Times wrote of him, summarizing his achievements: During the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), Heath engaged in a considerable number of civilian service activities, including donating his mansion for use as a military hospital, for which he was awarded an OBE. Business-wise, in 1915, following Zeppelin attacks on London, he estimated the number of Zeppelins, the frequency of attacks, the number of bombs each Zeppelin could carry, the damage area of an explosion, and how much of London was built up as opposed to open spaces. After calculating his risks he offered bomb insurance through the end of the war, raising and lowering his premiums with the intensity of the attacks. In 1919 Heath ventured into aviation insurance, and started the British Aviation Insurance Association. Also by 1919, he was noted as \\"the leader among the Lloyd's underwriters\\", with his finger on the pulse of the insurance public. During the 1920s Heath withdrew from daily business at Lloyd's, but his syndicate continued to lead the non-marine market. By the 1930s his annual income was estimated to be ¬£60,000, and his syndicate was underwriting for 300 members. Civilian services during the war At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Heath and his wife were living at Anstie Grange, their 26-room mansion in Surrey that was host to shooting parties, hunts, and balls. Heath immediately began recruiting, speaking at recruitment meetings, giving pep talks at Anstie Grange to local men who volunteered, and setting up a recruitment office at Lloyd's where volunteers could be sworn in. In 1915 he was appointed a Trustee of Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, which assists soldiers and sailors in distress and the widows and children of those who have died during military service. As his indoor staff enlisted in the war effort at his encouragement, their number was reduced from 26 to three. He allowed the local rifle club to use his rifle range and supplied them with ammunition, and allowed the London Civil Service Rifles to drill on his grounds. Heath was commissioned, along with Frederick Huth Jackson, Roger Owen, and two others, to create a scheme by which the government could insure the public against losses caused by bombing. The plan was adopted, and he served on the committee that carried it out until the end of the war. In September 1916, Heath gave his mansion Anstie Grange to the War Office for use as an officer's hospital. The Anstie Grange Officer's Hospital, also known as the Holmwood Hospital for Officers, was funded by Heath and fully outfitted with the most modern appliances. Dorothy Gore-Brown, a cousin of Heath's wife, was appointed Commandant of the hospital, and his daughter Genesta served as its pantry maid. It became a first-line hospital, receiving patients straight from the Western Front. The surgeons and staff totaled 50, and it housed 50 patients at a time; nearly 700 patients passed through the hospital from October 1916 to its closure in December 1918. It gained a reputation as one of the best hospitals in England. In 1919 Heath joined the Committee of the Labour Department, which allotted funds to enable soldiers and sailors, both officers and enlisted men, to be trained for civil employment. As the donor and organiser of the Anstie Grange Primary Hospital for Officers, Heath was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours, for civilian services in connection with the war. In July 1920 he also received a certificate of appreciation from Winston Churchill to hang in Angstie Grange, and an accompanying letter, in acknowledgement of the Army Council's gratitude.

Heath generously aided the struggling piano company, with both business advice and funds, and in 1902 became its Chairman. In 1891 Heath married Sarah Caroline Gore Gambier (1859‚Äì1944). They had two children, Leopold Cuthbert Heath (1894‚Äì1966), and Genesta Mary Heath (1899‚Äì1990). Upon the death of his uncle Douglas Heath in 1897, he took Kitlands, a small estate near Coldharbour, Surrey, on lease from his father, who had succeeded to the estate. During that time he also had a residence in London at 47 Portman Square. Upon the death of his father in 1907, Heath inherited his large country retirement estate Anstie Grange, near Dorking, Surrey, and moved there with his wife and two children. Anstie Grange, between Holmwood and Coldharbour, was a 26-bedroom mansion which had been purchased and remodeled by Heath's father in 1863. It had a staff of 50, including 26 indoor staff plus gardeners, stablemen, chauffeurs, and gamekeepers. Heath's wife entertained lavishly, hosting shooting parties, hunts, balls, and other gatherings for London's social √©lite. Heath also maintained a London residence at 15 Aldford Street in Mayfair. In 1929 he donated 200 acres near Leith Hill, Surrey to the National Trust for conservation. Heath enjoyed enjoyed fishing, shooting, and hunting. He funded Surrey Union Foxhounds during the war, and in 1918 he became its joint master. He was a member of several gentlemen's clubs in London, including the Sesame Club, the Windham Club, Boodle's, the City of London Club, the Ranelagh Club, and the Royal Automobile Club. In 1910 he was elected to membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and in later years often sailed his yacht in winter in the Mediterranean. In 1930 he purchased a small estate, La Domaine de Savaric, in √àze in the Alpes-Maritimes, France. His pastimes also included country walks, reading, and water colour painting. In 1938 Heath suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralysed. He died at Anstie Grange in March 1939. His memorial service was attended by almost every major financial figure in London, and letters of condolence poured in from the U.S. and all over the world. In its memorial tribute, The Economist called him \\"the first man to see the potentialities of insurance in the modern world\\"; it continued: \\"There are few departments of our modern life, which have not been touched at this point or that by his inventive genius. He had in him every element of greatness ‚Äì intellect, character, vision, courage and a deep personal humility.\\"  References  Further reading *Brown, Antony.

He is the Kernot Professor of Engineering at the University of Melbourne. He previously held the senior administrative roles of Vice-Chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology (2003‚Äì2011) and Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University (2011‚Äì2016). Young's field of research is Ocean Engineering and particularly the role of wind-generated ocean waves. His work has focused on the development of global wave prediction models, extreme wind and wave conditions, tropical cyclone generated waves, nearshore sea states and the role of global winds and waves in climate change. Young is an Honorary Fellow of Engineers Australia, a Fellow of the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, received the Centenary Medal \\"in recognition for his services to research\\" in 2000 and became an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2012 for his \\"services to higher education and research\\". He was awarded the Lorenz G. Straub medal for research in Hydraulic Engineering in 1986, the National Medal for Education by the Vietnamese government in 2012 and has been ranked by Engineers Australia as one of Australia‚Äôs top 100 Engineers. In 2017, he was awarded the Kevin Stark medal for excellence in Coastal and Ocean Engineering.  Education  Young attended Pimlico State High School and then studied Civil Engineering at James Cook University. He completed three degrees at James Cook, graduating with BE(Hons) (1979), MEngSc (1982) and PhD (1984). His PhD study was focused on Ocean Engineering and particularly ocean surface waves.  Research and career  Young was a postdoctoral research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg Germany (1983‚Äì1984), where he studied under Klaus Hasselmann. His post-doctoral work was focused on the use of ship radar to measure ocean waves, this work ultimately leading to the development of the WaMoS radar system. Young returned to Australia in 1984 and took up a teaching and research role at the Australian Defence Force Academy, where he remained until 1998. During this period, he rose through the academic ranks to become a full Professor in 1994 and Rector of the institution in 1998. At this time, Young‚Äôs research focused on the development of global numerical wave models, the development of nonlinear wave processes, shallow water waves and tropical cyclone wave models. His work on spectral wave models underpinned the development of today‚Äôs global models such as WaveWatch. His field research at Lake George near Canberra pioneered understanding of the growth of waves in finite depth conditions and has become a standard approach for engineering design in such situations.Young, I.R. and Verhagen, L.A., 1996, \\"The Growth of Fetch Limited Waves in Water of Finite Depth. Part I: Total Energy and Peak Frequency\\", Coastal Engineering, 28, 47-78. In 1999 he was appointed to the role of Executive Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Adelaide and subsequently became Pro Vice-Chancellor (International) in 2001. In 2003 he became the 2nd Vice- Chancellor of Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, where he served until 2011 when he became the 11th Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University in Canberra. In 2016 he returned to Melbourne to take up the position of Kernot Professor of Engineer at the University of Melbourne. Following 2010, Young's research has focused on the role of ocean wind and waves in climate and climate change.Young, I.R., Zieger, S. and Babanin, A.V., 2011, \\"Global trends in wind speed and wave height\\", Science, 332, 451-455, doi:10.1126/science.1197219.Young, I.R. and Ribal, A., 2019, \\"Multi-platform evaluation of global trends in wind speed and wave height\\", Science, 364, 548-552. doi: 10.1126/science.aav9527. This work has largely been achieved by building long-term databases of satellite observations of the ocean from altimeter, radiometer and scatterometer instruments. A series of publications in this field have highlighted changes in global wind speed and wave height climates over the past 30 years and pioneered this field of research.Ribal, A. and Young, I.R., 2019, ‚Äú33 years of globally calibrated wave height and wind speed data based on altimeter observations‚Äù, Sci. Data, 6, 77, doi: 10.1038/s41597-019-0083-9. = Administrative posts = Young‚Äôs term as Vice- Chancellor of Swinburne was marked by a transformation of the university from a largely teaching institution to one with high quality focused research activities. This sparked a rise in the university‚Äôs place in international rankings, entering the top 500 universities in the world in 2010. Young also transformed the Hawthorn campus of Swinburne through a multi-year capital development. He led a major redirection of Swinburne‚Äôs education programs with the creation of Swinburne Online, an online services company, established through a joint venture partnership with Seek in 2011. During this same period, Young had a national role, representing Australia‚Äôs universities as a Director of IDP Education, an international student recruitment company. Young‚Äôs period as Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University was often controversial. Internally, Young set out to restructure the finances and administrative structures of the institution, a process which required financial restraint and a voluntary early retirement scheme in 2014. Externally, Young became Chair of the Group of Eight in 2014, a time when the Australian Government proposed the deregulation of Australia‚Äôs university system. The Group of Eight became a strong supporter of this policy and hence Young was a public advocate. Ultimately, the controversial proposal was unable to pass the Australian Senate and hence did not come into effect. Young also expanded philanthropy at ANU and in 2012, alumnus Graham Tuckwell donated AUD 50 million to the university, this amount increasing to AUD 100 million in 2016. At the time, this was the largest philanthropic donation ever received by an Australian university. When Young retired from ANU in 2016, the University was ranked 19 in the world, the highest ranking ever achieved by an Australian university and he had put in place a major capital program to transform the built infrastructure of the ANU campus. = Business activities = Outside of his university research roles, Young is also involved in business activities. He is the President and CEO of Conviro, President of CloudCampus and Director of VERNet. He is also the Director of International Centre for Democratic Partnerships, a member of the Questacon Advisory Council and Chair Advisory Board of Cluey.  Awards and honors  *1986 - Lorenz G.

It contains a single species, Tangaroasaurus kakanuiensis. Similar to Basilosaurus and its close relative Squalodon, it was originally thought to be a species of marine reptile. Parts of the Holotype are presumably lost. Its name comes from Tangaroa, the Maori god of the sea, while the suffix -saurus comes from the Latin word for reptile, the group that Tangaroasaurus was originally placed in. The type fossil was found in a grey clay deposit at All Day Bay and consists of a jaw bearing a few teeth, measuring 5 cm each. The original describer of the type specimen, William Blaxland Benham, described it as a reptile, either a dinosaur such as Megalosaurus or an late surviving ichthyosaur. The genus was described as an odontocete cetacean in 1979 by R. E. Fordyce. The status of the genus as a cetacean remains under discussion.

It is distinguished from the concept of a nation state by describing a country's dominant sociopolitical modes as constituting a category larger than a single nation. When classifying states as civilization states, emphasis is often placed on a country's historical continuity and cultural unity across a large geographic region. The term was first coined in the 1990s as a way to describe China,Pye, Lucian W.1990. \\"Erratic State, Frustrated Society.\\" Foreign Affairs. 69(4): 56-74 but has also been used to describe nations such as Russia, India, and Turkey. China as a civilization state The term \\"civilization-state\\" was first used by scholars in the 1990s to categorize China as having a distinct sociopolitical character, as opposed to viewing it as a nation state in the European model. The use of this new term implies that China was and still is an \\"empire state\\" with a unique political tradition and governmental structure, and its proponents asserted that the nation state model fails to properly describe the evolution of the Chinese state. Proponents of the label describe China as having a unique historical and cultural unity, derived from a continuous process of cultural syncretism. The term was further popularized by its use in When China Rules the World by Martin Jacques. According to Li Xing and Timothy Shaw, the central feature of analyzing China as a civilization state is the view that the Chinese state derives its legitimacy from the continuation of a sociopolitical order which posits that the state maintains natural authority over its subjects, and that it is the \\"guardian\\" of both its citizens and their society, a view of the state that is completely distinct from the Westphalian nation-state model. Other scholars make the case that the key features of a civilization-state are the maintenance of an ethos of cultural unity despite displaying significant cultural diversity, across centuries of history and a large geographic space. Some specifically draw attention to the longevity of the Chinese writing system, or describe China's existence as being uniquely and inexorably tied to the past. Guang Xia pushes back on the idea of the uniqueness of a Chinese civilization-state. Xia argues that civilization-state discourse in China studies is an important and positive development, as it allows for characteristics of the modern Chinese state to be properly analyzed in the context of their history. However, Xia concludes that ultimately, all civilizations must reinvent themselves in the context of their history, and that it is a mistake to view China as a static entity or to portray it as being more tied to its past than the rest of the world.  Other examples of proposed civilization states  = India = Although the modern conception of India as a single entity was created by the British Raj, India has been proposed as an example of a civilization state, with political commentators arguing that a shared Indian identity predates British colonization. = Russia = Vladimir Putin's administration has at times embraced the rhetoric of portraying Russia as a distinct Eurasian civilization-state. Criticism Journalist Gideon Rachman argued in 2019 that the concept of a civilization state is at odds with conceptions of universal human rights and common democratic standards, and is inherently exclusive to minority groups who do not share the feature(s) that define a particular civilization state (for example, they may have a different religion).

The field encompasses naturally seen cancers in veterinary patients and the extremely low rates of cancers seen in large mammals such as elephants and whales.  Mammalian cancers  Species that are treated in the veterinary clinic, including dogs, cats, horses and ferrets, present human-relevant cancers. = Canines = Of these, the dog has the greatest number of incidents. One in four dogs older than 2 dies of cancer, a rate that has increased, which may in part be explained by reductions in other causes of death. Canine cancer shares features with human cancer, including histology, tumor genetics, molecular targets, biological behavior and therapeutic response. Canine histologies include osteosarcoma, melanoma, non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, leukemia, prostate, breast and lung cancer, head and neck cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and bladder cancer. Tumor initiation and progression are influenced by age, nutrition, sex, reproduction and environmental exposure. Canine models support the study of metastasis, disease recurrence and resistance patterns, with relevance to human cancers. Since 2009 some ten drugs have been developed in part based on studies with dogs. On July 3, 2019 FDA approved selinexor (Xpovio) for multiple myeloma patients who have failed five or more therapies. Verdinexor is the veterinary form of this drug. It is under study for canine lymphoma and as a human antiviral therapy.  Large mammals  Since cancer typically begins as a mutation in a single cell, risks should increase with the number of cells in an organism. Elephants carry 100 times as many cells as humans, while whales have ten times more than elephants. Both should experience higher cancer rates than humans. However, these species instead have few cancers. This situation is known as Peto‚Äôs paradox. Around 50 MYA, mammals began living in the sea, later evolving into whales. They remained small until about 3 MYA when they reached sizes common to modern cetaceans. As whale sizes increased, tumour-suppressor genes increased in number and effect. 33 tumour-suppressing genes have been identified in humpback whales. These include atr, which detects damage to DNA and halts cell division; amer1, which slows cell growth; and reck, which limits metastasis. Humpbacks have multiple copies of genes that promote apoptosis. Gigantism in cetacea is associated with selective pressure in favor of tumor-suppressing genes. Cancer biologists are familiar with the atr, amer1 and reck genes because they are found in humans. Whales may also harbour tumour-fighting genes unknown in humans. Elephants have a cancer-mortality rate of about 5% (humans face 11-25%). Elephant genomes include tp53, a gene that encodes apoptosis-inducing protein p53. Humans have two copies of tp53‚Äîone from each parent. If one copy is dysfunctional humans experience Li-Fraumeni syndrome, accompanied by cancer. By contrast, elephant chromosomes have 40 copies of tp53. Elephant p53 appears to be more powerful than its human counterpart. One experiment involves lipid spheres loaded with proteins, including a synthetic form of elephant p53.  Other species  Researchers are investigating cancer rates in 13,000 animal species, including 170,000+ specimens, including sponges that have no reported cancer.

SRS is caused by a mutated SMS gene at chromosome Xp21.3-p22.12, which carries instructions for producing the enzyme spermine synthase. Spermine synthase in turn helps the body produce spermine, a polyamine critical to cell processes such as cell division, tissue repair, and apoptosis. The resulting shortage of spermine in cells causes problems with development and brain function, though the exact mechanism is not understood. The syndrome has also been referred to as Snyder‚ÄìRobinson X-linked mental retardation syndrome (MRXSSR) and spermine synthase deficiency. SRS exclusively affects males. Only about ten families currently have a child with SRS, and 50 people have been diagnosed worldwide since 1969. Presentation Snyder‚ÄìRobinson usually is noticeable in infants, causing hypotonia and declining muscle tone with age. Seizures can occur in childhood, and children are especially susceptible to broken bones. During early childhood, SRS causes mild to profound intellectual disability; speech difficulties; problems with walking; osteoporosis; marfanoid habitus; and scoliosis, kyphosis, or both (kyphoscoliosis).Distinctive facial features include a cleft palate, facial asymmetry, and a prominent lower lip.Kidney problems may also occur, such as nephrocalcinosis and renal cysts. Cause SRS is a recessive X-linked condition. There are no known female cases, as both copies of the X chromosome would need to be mutated. Diagnosis When SRS is suspected, doctors will order a molecular genetic test to confirm a mutation in the SMS gene‚Äîspecifically a \\"hemizygous loss-of-function... pathogenic variant\\". However, there are currently no formal criteria for a diagnosis. Management Individuals with Snyder‚ÄìRobinson may be assisted by occupational therapy, physical or speech therapy. Anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and clobazam can be used to manage seizures‚Äîthe medication used often is influenced by the type of seizure. Bone density can be determined via a DXA scan and may be improved with calcium supplements. In 2014, several parents of individuals with SRS founded the Snyder‚ÄìRobinson Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in the US. It is a member of the National Organization for Rare Disorders. History SRS was first reported in a 1969 paper published in Clinical Pediatrics by Russell D. Snyder and Arthur Robinson, who described the syndrome as \\"recessive sex- linked mental retardation in the absence of other recognizable abnormalities\\".

Early life  Bonet was the daughter of Francesc Bonet, a native of Peramola (Alt Urgell), refugee in Andorra because of the Rif War, and one of the daughters of Cal Farrer√≥ d'Escaldes. Up to 12 years of age, she attended the French school in Escaldes, together with her sisters. When leaving the school all three would leave to France to work, while Bonet would stay in Andorra because of their parents' wishes. He started working as a hairdresser, in a barber shop on the lower floors of his house, which had a small space dedicated to ladies' hairdressers. Since Andorra did not have the necessary materials, Bonet moved to Toulouse to buy materials to use in their establishment, and also to sell them. The social changes that occurred in Andorra during the second half of the 20th century and the consumerist fever that became the root cause of the political situation in neighboring countries make J√∫lia Bonet increase the sale of products in a very significant way, leading to physical separation of the hairdresser, from the part that dedicated to sell perfumes. In 1948 Bonet married Pere Zamora, a worker of FHASA, who later joined the family business. With him, she had three daughters, Anna Maria, Melania and Immaculada who would also end up joining the business.  The business expansion  The good operation of the company made the first business facilities improve, and little by little they were opening other stores in other parts of the country. Specifically, in 1958, Bonet would open what would be the second store in Meritxell Avenue Meritxell Avenue of Andorra la Vella. In 1961, she opened a third place in Escaldes, under the name Anmei, based on the name of their three daughters. In 1970, she opened the Ibis d'Escaldes perfumery, motivated by the need not to leave a part of the neglected clientele due to the works that were carried out in the mansion of J√∫lia Bonet. The first center opened outside the central and commercial center of the country in Pas de la Casa, in 1983, which encouraged sales to visitors from Andorra on the French border. Towards 1985, Bonet decided to close the hairdresser's shop that continued to run, and to build one of the centers for marriage, the J√∫lia Center, presided over by a monumental clock called \\"Horloge √† voir le temps couler\\", by Bernard Gitton. At that time, she also decided to create his own range of products, which would later be updated in 2004. In 1999, it began to expand outside the Andorran borders, specifically in Spain, where it opened several perfumes around the country.  Death  On the morning of 3 September 2011, Bonet suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest in her apartment located in Vilafortuny (Cambrils). She was transferred to the Hospital de Reus, and nothing could be done to save her life. The burial took place in the Church of Sant Pere M√†rtir in Escaldes-Engordany on September 5.

It is named after Sanjoy Dasgupta, who formulated it in 2016. Its key property is that, when the similarity comes from an ultrametric space, the optimal clustering for this quality measure follows the underlying structure of the ultrametric space. In this sense, clustering methods that produce good clusterings for this objective can be expected to approximate the ground truth underlying the given similarity measure. In Dasgupta's formulation, the similarity between elements is given by an undirected graph G=(V,E), with non-negative real weights on its edges. Large weights indicate elements that should be considered more similar to each other, while small weights or missing edges indicate pairs of elements that are not similar. A hierarchical clustering can be described by a tree (not necessarily a binary tree) whose leaves are the elements to be clustered; the clusters are then the subjects of elements descending from each tree node, and the size C of any cluster C is its number of elements. For each edge uv of the input graph, let w(uv) denote the weight of edge uv and let C(uv) denote the smallest cluster of a given clustering that contains both u and v. Then Dasgupta defines the cost of a clustering to be :\\\\sum_{uv\\\\in E} w(uv)\\\\cdot C(uv). The optimal clustering for this objective is NP-hard to find. However, it is possible to find a clustering that approximates the minimum value of the objective in polynomial time by a divisive (top-down) clustering algorithm that repeatedly subdivides the elements using an approximation algorithm for the sparsest cut problem, the problem of finding a partition that minimizes the ratio of the total weight of cut edges to the total number of cut pairs. Equivalently, for purposes of approximation, one may minimize the ratio of the total weight of cut edges to the number of elements on the smaller side of the cut. Using the best known approximation for the sparsest cut problem, the approximation ratio of this approach is O(\\\\sqrt{\\\\log n}).

The company creates ‚Äúdevised, interactive and issue-based‚Äù theatre projects focused on social justice using techniques such as Augusto Boal's Forum Theatre and principles of Community Arts and Community Cultural Development. It has been described as \\"one of the most innovative, inclusive and dynamic companies in Australia\\". The company's projects focus on communities of LGBTIQ+, First Nations Australians, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities, including a number of programs in schools or for young people. It has been compared to former theatre companies such as Melbourne Workers Theatre and Junction Theatre Company as an arts organisations working across multiple communities.  History  The company was founded in 2007 by three high school friends, including Artistic Director Edwin Kemp Attrill. The company initially created street theatre performances, on political issues such as the incarceration of Adelaide-born Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks. Initial ensemble members were drawn from the Adelaide branch of Amnesty International Australia and local youth theatre company Urban Myth Theatre of Youth. The company is controlled by a Board of Management and is registered as a charity with Australian Charity and Not for Profit Commission. In 2018 the company established a city based rehearsal studio, office and small arts venue called MakeSpace. Previously, ActNow Theatre were supported by Carclew through a base at Fifth Quarter, a co-working space in Brompton, Adelaide. Initially the company was located in co-working spaces in UrText Studios and Format Collective.  Company activity  Examples of projects include school safety program Expect Respect with the Legal Services Commission of South Australia, anti-racism education program Responding to Racism with Reconciliation South Australia, Queer Youth Theatre workshops, the Game Makers program for kids and dads, and workshop program for culturally diverse artists, the Theatre of the Global Majority (2018-2019). The projects involve participatory theatre techniques, which empower audiences to change aspects of the performances and be active contributors and commentators to broader social movements. > \\"ActNow creates participatory theatre, not just to engage our audience but > also to empower them to be agents of social change within a project and in > their own lives. We don‚Äôt want our audience to sit quietly in the dark. We > want them active as contributors and commentators. Our work finds new ways > to engage with our audiences, through technology and a deep relationship > between artists and audiences. The simple act of storytelling can engage > audiences and create positive social change. As such, our aesthetic is > typically paired back and raw, using everyday environments and technologies > to create life changing experiences.\\" - Artistic Director Edwin Kemp Attrill Artists involved in the company include Artistic Director Edwin Kemp Attrill, singer/songwriter Nathan May, poet/writer/performer Manal Younus and Associate Director Yasmin Gurreeboo.  Notable Projects  = Decameron 2.0 in partnership with State Theatre Company of South Australia = In 2020 ActNow Theatre partnered with State Theatre Company of South Australia to create Decameron 2.0, a project inspired by 14th century Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio‚Äôs landmark The Decameron. The original novellas encompassed 100 stories told by 10 young people and their servants who fled to the countryside of Florence to escape the plague. In Decameron 2.0, 100 stories of contemporary South Australian characters were commissioned and filmed over 10 weeks in Adelaide. It has been described as ‚Äúthe Pinnacle of theatre in COVID age‚Äù and possibly the largest new work from theatre-makers globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of creating Decameron 2.0 consisted of a meeting each week between 10 writers, including 5 core writers Alexis West, Ben Brooker, Emily Steel, Alex Vickery-Howe, Sally Hardy and 5 guest or community based writers. In each weeks meeting they would be given a theme such as fortune, fate, love and virtue. Each writer has one day to write it, then it‚Äôs filmed and edited and delivered digitally at the end of that week. The project received significant praise for its involvement of diverse stories and storytellers, including cultural diversity, sexuality, disability, age and professional status. Of the core writers Alexis West is First Nations artist, and was joined by two emerging first nations writers Kiara Milera and Kyron Weetra who alternated each week. These monologues by First Nations writers were standouts, such as Alexis West‚Äôs Teahrnah, played by Elaine Crombie, about a mother being pulled over by the police while driving to the supermarket, making references to the killing of George Floyd with the line ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù. Notable artists involved in Decameron 2.0 include Ben Brooker, Mitchell Butel, Elena Carapetis, Kate Cheel, Elaine Crombie, Yasmin Gurreeboo, Teddy Hodgeman, Matt Hyde, Trevor Jamieson, Carmel Johnson, Phillip Kavanagh, Edwin Kemp Attrill, Finegan Kruckenmeyer, Verity Laughton, Martha Lott, Sarah Peters, Jacqy Phillips, Susan Prior, Emily Steel, Rory Walker, Alexis West and Manal Younus.  Virtual Intimacy (ËôõÊì¨Ë¶™ÂØÜ) in partnership with Very Theatre (Taiwan)  Over three years, ActNow Theatre worked with Very Theatre in Taiwan to develop a new work called Virtual Intimacy, commissioned by Arts Centre Melbourne's Asia TOPA Festival and National Theatre of Taiwan. The project explored how people‚Äôs relationships with technology are changing the relationships between people. The project was developed through collaboration with queer communities and artists in Taipei, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The basis of the production was the difference between the two Co-Directors, Tung-Yen Chou and Edwin Kemp Attrill: > Edwin and Yen come from distinctly different backgrounds and experiences. > Yen, based in Taiwan and coming from a background of film and theatre, is > creating highly visual and technical work. Edwin, based in Adelaide, is > creating community-based and participatory storytelling projects with a > focus on social justice.

Qing-rule affected the position of women in society. Intermarriage between Han and Turks There were eras in Xinjiang's history where intermarriage was common. \\"Laxity\\" led Uyghur women to marry Chinese men and not wear veils after Yaqub Beg's rule ended. Uyghurs also believe that they have Han Chinese ancestry from historical intermarriage (see around 10th century), such as those living in Turpan. From 1911-1949 when the Kuomintang ruled, many Uyghur girls approached Han soldiers for relationships. Although banned in Islam, a form of temporary marriage from which the man could easily terminate and ignore the traditional contract was created. It was called \\"marriage of convenience\\" by Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. However such marriages were repeatedly conducted even in the Quran's Surah Fatiha by an Emam between Ughlug Beg's great granddaughter Nura Han and Ahmad Kamal. Even though Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, between 1880-1949 the Islamic law was frequently flouted in Xinjiang since Chinese men married Uyghur women anyway. Foreigners suggest it was because the women were poor. Uyghur women who married Chinese were labeled as whores, and their marriages considered illegitimate by Islamic law. = Benefits = However the women obtained great benefits by marrying Chinese men nonetheless since the Chinese defended them from Islamic authorities so the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save income for themselves. The Uyghur women also were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands so they could make their Chinese husbands provide them as much money as she wanted for her relatives and herself since otherwise the women could just leave. Moreover, the property of Chinese men was left to their Uyghur wives after they died. Uyghur women who intermarried considered Uyghur men to be inferior husbands to Chinese (and Hindus). Because they were viewed as \\"impure\\" Islamic cemeteries banned the Uyghur wives of Chinese men from being buried within them. The Uyghur women got around this problem by donating to shrines and buying graves in other towns. Besides Chinese men, others in Xinjiang such as Afghans, Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis intermarried with local Uyghur women. Le Coq reported that in his time sometimes Uyghurs distrusted Tungans (Hui Muslims) more than Han Chinese, so that a Tungan would never be given a Uyghur woman in marriage by her father, while a (Han) Chinese men could be given a Uyghur woman in marriage by her father. In Kashgar 1933 the Chinese kept concubines and spouses who were Turkic women. = Qing \\"temporary marriages\\" = Xinjiang temporary marriage, marriage de convenance, was called \\"waqitliq toy\\" in Uyghur. It was one of the prevalent forms of polygamy, \\"the mulla who performs the ceremony arranging for the divorce at the same time.\\" The women and men married for a fixed period of time, several days to a week. While temporary marriage was banned in Russian Turkestan, Chinese-ruled Xinjiang permitted the temporary marriage where it was widespread. As a result, Chinese merchants and soldiers, and some foreigners like Russians, foreign Muslims, and other Uyghur merchants all engaged in temporary marriages with Uyghur women. Since a lot of foreigners lived in Yarkand, temporary marriage flourished there more than it did in areas towards Kucha's east. The basic formalities of normal marriages were maintained as a facade even in temporary marriages. Prostitution by Uyghur women due to the buying of daughters from impoverished families and divorced women was recorded by Scotsman George Hunter. Mullahs officiated temporary marriages; and both the divorce and the marriage proceedings were undertaken in the same ceremony if the marriage was only to last for a certain arranged time. There was also a temporary marriage bazaar in Yangi Hissar according to Nazaroff. Temporary marriages especially violated Sunni Islam Sharia. = \\"Slut-shaming\\" and mixed children = The local society accepted the Uyghur women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages violating Sharia. Uyghur women also conducted \\"temporary marriages\\" with Chinese men such as nearby Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed for tours of duty. After these marriages the Chinese men returned to their own cities and \\"sold\\" their mixed daughters and Uyghur wives to his comrades. They took their sons with them if they could afford it but otherwise left them behind. Valikhanov claimed that the mixed children of Turkistan were referred to as √ßalƒüurt. Uyghur women were bashed for having \\"negative character\\" by a Kashgari Uyghur woman's Tibetan husband. Racist views of each other's ethnicities between partners in interethnic marriages still persisted sometimes. During this era it was mostly Uyghur women marrying foreign men with a few cases of the opposite occurring. Turkic Muslims in different areas of Xinjiang held derogatory views of each other such as claiming that Chinese men were welcomed by the loose Yam√ßi girls. Andijani (Kokandi) Turkic Muslim merchants (from modern Uzbekistan), who shared the same religion, similar culture, cuisine, clothing, and phenotypes with the Altishahri Uyghurs, also frequently married local Altishahri women. The name \\"chalgurt\\" was also applied to their mixed race daughters and sons. The daughters were left behind with their Uyghur Altishahri mothers while the sons were taken by the Kokandi fathers when they returned to their homeland. The Qing then banned Khoqandi merchants from marrying Kashgari women. Due to 'group jealously'; religious, ethnic differences; and sex; disputes broke out due to Chinese and Uighur. The Uighur locals also viewed fellow Turkic Muslim Andijanis as competitors for \\"their own women.\\" A Uyghur proverb said \\"Do not let a man from Andijan into your house.\\" = Written accounts = Childless, married youthful women were called \\"chaucan\\" by Uyghurs: \\"there was the chaucan always ready to contract an alliance for a long or short period with the merchant or traveller visiting the country or with anybody else\\". Henry Lansdell wrote in 1893 in his book Chinese Central Asia an account of temporary marriage practiced by a Uyghur Muslim woman, who married three different Chinese officers and a Muslim official. The station of prostitutes was accorded by society to these Muslim women who had sex with Chinese men. Intermarriage and patronage of prostitutes were among the forms of interaction between the Uyghur in Xinjiang and visiting Chinese merchants. Many of the young Kashgari women were most attractive in appearance, and some of the little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children... The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits. The peasants are fairly well off, as the soil is rich, the abundant water-supply free, and the taxation comparatively light. It was always interesting to meet them taking their live stock into market. Flocks of sheep with tiny lambs, black and white, pattered along the dusty road; here a goat followed its master like a dog, trotting behind the diminutive ass which the farmer bestrode; or boys, clad in the whity-brown native cloth, shouted incessantly at donkeys almost invisible under enormous loads of forage, or carried fowls and ducks in bunches head downwards, a sight that always made me long to come to the rescue of the luckless birds.Certainly the mullas do their best to keep the fair sex in their place, and are in the habit of beating those who show their faces in the Great Bazar. But I was told that poetic justice had lately been meted out to one of these upholders of the law of Islam, for by mistake he chastised a Kashgari woman married to a Chinaman, whereupon the irate husband set upon him with a big stick and castigated him soundly.http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Through_Deserts_and_Oases_of_Central_Asia_1000333001/83https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023243391/cu31924023243391_djvu.txt Almost every Chinaman in Yarkand, soldier or civilian, takes unto himself a temporary wife, dispensing entirely with the services of the clergy, as being superfluous, and most of the high officials also give way to the same amiable weakness, their mistresses being in almost all cases natives of Khotan, which city enjoys the unenviable distinction of supplying every large city in Turkestan with courtesans.When a Chinaman is called back to his own home in China proper, or a Chinese soldier has served his time in Turkestan and has to return to his native city of Pekin or Shanghai, he either leaves his temporary wife behind to shift for herself, or he sells her to a friend. If he has a family he takes the boys with him‚Äîif he can afford it‚Äîfailing that, the sons are left alone and unprotected to fight the battle of life, while in the case of daughters, he sells them to one of his former companions for a trifling sum.The natives, although all Mahammadans, have a strong predilection for the Chinese, and seem to like their manners and customs, and never seem to resent this behaviour to their womankind, their own manners, customs, and morals [?] being of the very loosest description. That a Muslim should take in marriage one of alien faith is not objected to; it is rather deemed a meritorious act thus to bring an unbeliever to the true religion. The Muslim woman, on the other hand, must not be given in marriage to a non-Muslim; such a union is regarded as the most heinous of sins. In this matter, however, compromises are sometimes made with heaven: the marriage of a Uyghur princess with the emperor Ch'ien-lung has already been referred to; and, when the present writer passed through Minjol (a day's journey west of Kashgar) in 1902, a Chinese with a Uyghur wife [concubine?] was presented to him. He procured me a Chinese interpreter, Fong Shi, a pleasant and agreeable young Chinaman, who wrote his mother-tongue with ease and spoke Jagatai Uyghur fluently, and‚Äîdid not smoke opium. He left his wife and child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even before we left Khotan.Hedin 1898, p. 937.Hedin 1899 , p. 921. Thus the young Chinaman's proud dream of one day riding through the gates of Peking and beholding the palace (yamen) of his fabulously mighty emperor, as well as of perhaps securing, through my recommendation, a lucrative post, and finally, though by no means last in his estimation, of exchanging the Uyghur wife he had left behind in Khotan for a Chinese bride‚Äîthis proud dream was pricked at the foot of Arka-tagh. Sadly and silently he stood alone in the desert, gazing after us, as we continued our way towards the far-distant goal of his youthful ambition.Hedin 1898, p. 970.Hedin 1899 , p. 954.  Women in Uyghur society  The lack of Han Chinese women in Xinjiang led to Uyghur Muslim women marrying Han Chinese men. Moreover, Unmarried Muslim Uyghur women married non-Muslims like Chinese if they could not find a Muslim husband. These women were hated by their families and people. In 1917 the Swedish Christian missionary J. E. Lundahl confirmed that the local Muslim women in Xinjiang married Chinese men because of a lack of Chinese women, and that the relatives of the woman and other Muslims reviled the women for their marriages. = Societal expectations = Among Uyghurs it was thought that God designed women to endure hardship and work, the word for \\"helpless one\\",  øƒÅjiza, was used to call women who were not married while women who were married were called mazl≈´m among Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, however, divorce and remarriage was facile for the women = Marriage = Women of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar usually married at ages 14 ‚Äì 15 minimum. Sometimes it was even 12 years for girls and 13 for boys. Cousin marriages were practiced by the wealthy. There was no marriage between adherents of the Artish located pro-China Black Mountain and the Kucha located anti-China White Mountain sects. Marriages were arranged and arbitrated with financial and religious obligations from both parties. Less complicated arrangements were made for widows and divorcees who wanted to marry again. Wives were often judged according to how many children they could bear. Ceremonies were held after the birth of a child. Public shaming was arranged for adulterers. Women called to Allah to grant them marriage by the shrines of saints. = Banning of child-marriages = Child marriages for girls was very common and the Uyghurs called girls \\"overripe\\" if they were not married by 16 or 18 years old. Marriages were arranged, and husbands were sought out for suitable matches by parents. The high number of \\"child marriages\\" at an extreme young age led to high divorce rates. =Veils= Traveller Ahmad Kamal writes an account in Land without Laughter , which describes his trip to Xinjiang during the Kumul Rebellion. In the streets of the bazar of √úr√ºmqi Uyghur women did not veil unlike southern Xinjiang's Muslim bazars where women veiled in public. Nomadic women did not wear the face veil and neither did peasant women. Only urban rich did. Kamal saw an unveiled peasant woman Jennett Han. The face veil was only allowed to be taken off in the house and were worn just for their husbands and fellow women to see. When Kamal and his companions spied on a boudoir in a Uyghur garden, the young women dropped their veils whereas the \\"older hags\\" were angry (at the peeping Toms). Face covering veils with caps of otter were worn in the streets by women in public in Xinjiang. In order to properly mount her stirrup with her foot, one Uyghur woman had to temporarily lift her veil to see better. Ahmad Kamal's girlfriend Nura Han covered her face with the veil but then removed it after marrying him. One saying was that > \\"Muslim maidens wear the red that bespeaks a virgin, and the transparency of > their veils reveals a desire to change their raiment's hue.\\" = Prostitution = Uyghur prostitutes were encountered by Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim who wrote they were especially to be found in Khotan.http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-1-A-224/V-1/page/0056.html.ja He commented on \\"venereal diseases\\". Different ethnic groups had different attitudes toward prostitution. George W. Hunter (missionary) noted that while Tungan Muslims would almost never prostitute their daughters, Uyghur Muslims would, which was why Uyghur prostitutes were common around the country.

History The group was part of the Free Syrian Army in the Raqqa Governorate, originating as a sub-unit of Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa in 2012, and continued to hold a close relationship with Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa working closely with the group. Though unlike Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa it clashed frequently with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also unlike Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa recognized the Supreme Military Council and the Syrian National Council and was officially linked with it. The group was later completely expelled from the Raqqa Governorate by ISIL and was exiled in Kobani in the eastern part of the Aleppo Governorate later taking part in the defense of the city against ISIL, alongside other Free Syrian Army groups and the People's Protection Units (YPG), and went on to form a joint operations room called the Euphrates Volcano in 2014. The group was also allied with the Euphrates Islamic Liberation Front that together with the Euphrates Volcano operation room went on to form the Syrian Democratic Forces. The group participated in fighting against the Syrian government during the 2012-2013 rebel offensive in the Raqqa governorate, alongside groups including Jabhat al-Nusra, ISIL, Ahrar al-Sham and other Free Syrian Army and opposition groups eventually leading to the ousting of the Syrian government from much of the governorate, including Raqqa city itself. In July 2014, the group published a statement alongside Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa and another group called the \\"Group of Battalions Jarabulus and its Countryside\\" which is a Turkish-aligned Free Syrian Army insurgent group operating in the Raqqa Govenorate targeting ISIL by carrying out IED attacks, along with mortar strikes and minor clashes, asking for reinforcements to be sent by the Supreme Military Council in light of the growth of ISIL. In 2015, the group joined Jaysh al-Salam and in 2016 changed its name to Liwa Ahrar al-Raqqa and officially joined the Syrian Democratic Forces.

Life and career  Born in D√ºsseldorf, Overbeck was a great-granddaughter of the L√ºbeck mayor Christian Adolph Overbeck, a great-niece of the painter Friedrich Overbeck and a niece of the archaeologist Johannes Overbeck. After the separation of her parents in 1866, the mother moved with her and her siblings to London. She received an education at the London Royal College of Music and obtained a diploma in conducting, organ playing, piano playing and composition.Fritz Penzoldt, Sigrid On√©gin, Magdeburg 1939, p. 45 She was piano accompanist to Clara Butt and students of Manuel Patricio Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a in London.Ebendort In the 1890s she made friends with Edward Gordon Craig and wrote the stage music for his adaptation of Alfred de Musset's On ne badine pas avec I'amour, which was performed in Uxbridge in 1894. In 1898 she studied in Taormina with Zinaida Hippius and began an affair with her. With Hippius she came to Saint Petersburg, where in 1902/03 she wrote music for the Alexandrinsky Theatre overtures Antigone, Phedre and Danse russe).Sophie Fuller: \\"Devoted Attention\\": Looking for Lesbian Musicians in Fin-de-siecle Britain, in Queer episodes in music and modern identity. University of Illinois Press, 2002 , . Fuller, however, knows nothing about her later life and considers her a real Russian noblewoman. On 21 February 1904 there was a performance of her Petersburg stage music in East Stonehouse at Plymouth, which Baroness Overbeck conducted herself.See The Strad 16 (1904), , also discussed in Musical Times. There was a real Baroness Overbeck at that time: Romaine von Overbeck, n√©e Goddard, the wife of Gustav Freiherr von Overbeck (1830-1894) and temporary lover of Hans von B√ºlow. She returned from Petersburg under the name \\"Baron Eugene Borisovich On√©gin\\" (also \\"Baron Eugene Borisovich Lhwoff-On√©gin\\") and stated to be a grand-nephew of the Russian Grand Duke Alexei Lvov, composer of the Russian national anthem God Save the Tsar!. The extent to which Overbeck was inspired to create this masquerade by Clara Butt, who liked to wear men's trousers and smoke cigars, remains unclear. Overbeck was responsible for the vocal training of the then young song artist and later opera singer Sigrid On√©gin, who at the time still performed under her middle-class name Lilly Hoffmann. Overbeck accompanied her at the same time during piano performances. She had discovered Hoffmann during an audition at the Spangenberg Conservatory, the forerunner of today's Wiesbaden Music Academy. The two entered into a relationship - \\"the unequal couple, the almost stately seventeen-year-old, who almost towers over the nine year older one by the main length, and the dainty, almost overly tender companions... She knew that people were surprised that she, who had beaten out so many clients, now felt attached to a man... Even though Lilly had a tender love for children from an early age... she was not allowed to think of herself now.\\" On 25 January 1913, Overbeck married Lilly Hoffmann in London under the name Baron On√©gin.Isabel Sellheim, The family of the painter Friedrich Overbeck (1789-1869) in genealogical overviews. Neustadt an der Aisch 1989, Deutsches Familienarchiv Vol 104, , GW , Hoffmann's mother had \\"not yet overcome her aversion to him... Here there was only one solution to withdraw the girl from her mother's will... Without informing her mother, they leave, are secretly married in London.\\"Fritz Penzoldt, Sigrid On√©gin, Magdeburg 1939, p. 49f From 1912 until her death in 1919 she lived with Hoffmann in Stuttgart, where she had an engagement at the opera and now appeared under the name Sigrid On√©gin. During the First World War, Overbeck had to hide as an alleged \\"Russian man\\" from the authorities until \\"he\\" was denounced and arrested in 1916. Sigrid On√©gin was supposedly released because of her influence.The absence of a scandal and the uncritical mention as \\"husband\\" in later reference works suggest that the fictitious marriage did not become public. What is preserved is a recording of the Ave Maria, composed by Overbeck and sung by Sigrid On√©gin. Overbeck died in Stuttgart at age 49.  Work  * Eleanore. Song, words by E. Mackay. London: C.

It acted as both a judicial and executive authority and constituted part of the Dutch colonial system of 'indirect rule'. The rechtszitting, or official seat or building, housing the Kong Koan was called a Kong Tong (Chinese: ÂÖ¨Â†Ç; pinyin: Gongtang; literally 'tribunal' or 'law court'). Overview The Kong Koan as a government body was inseparable from the institution of Chinese officers, who were high-ranking civil administrators, appointed by the Dutch colonial authorities to govern the local Chinese community in colonial Indonesia. In the larger cities, the active officers sat as a council, the Kong Koan, in order to adjudicate justice, govern the local Chinese community and implement the directives of the colonial government. In executing these responsibilities, the Kong Koan had its own administrative staff, headed by the First Secretary or Toa Tju, and at the height of its power also had its own police force. History Among the Chinese Councils of colonial Indonesia, the Kong Koan of Batavia was ‚Äî in the words of Mary Somers Heidhues ‚Äî 'primus inter pares, first founded, longest serving and most powerful.' In contrast, those of Surabaya, Semarang and other cities were not as old and did not serve for as long. The Batavia historian, P. de Roo de La Faille, traces the origin of the first Kong Koan to 1660, when the Dutch East India Company granted a plot of land to be used as a Chinese cemetery. According to de Roo de La Faille, the voluntary community organisation that managed the cemetery became the precursor of the Kong Koan. In the following decades, this community organisation acquired more government-related functions under the leadership of Batavia's Chinese officers. In the aftermath of the Chinese Massacre of 1740, with the ensuing Chinese War still raging in the Javanese heartland, the colonial authorities felt a need to have a better relationship with Batavia's Chinese community. This led in 1742 to the reconstitution of the capital's informal Chinese community organisation as the Kong Koan of Batavia, an official government body within the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. The High Government (Hoge Regering) provided the newly recognised council with its first Kong Tong or tribunal at Jalan Tiang Bendera in Batavia's Old Town. Membership was capped at eight and consisted of the city's active Chinese officers. The Kong Koan was presided by its most senior Chinese officer, bearing the rank of Kapitein der Chinezen until 1837, thereafter that of Majoor der Chinezen. This body assumed the character of a yamen or Qing Dynasty government department. In 1750, the council acquired an official secretary, then in 1766 an adjunct secretary. In 1809, Tan Peeng Ko, Kapitein der Chinezen of Batavia set up a subsidiary office on the southern side of the city, closer to Glodok, the Chinese quarter, to simplify the implementation of the council's day-to-day activities. In 1866, Kapitein Tan Peeng Ko's son and successor, Tan Eng Goan, the 1st Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, officially moved the Kong Tong to larger premises in Tongkangan, where the Koan Koan remained until its abolition by the Republic of Indonesia in the early 1950s. The history of other Chinese councils is neither as old nor as well documented. The Kong Koan of Surabaya became defunct in the 1930s following the abolition of the system of Chinese officers. Similarly, the Kong Koan of Semarang, which was only founded in 1835, was dismantled in 1931.

Low-Energy Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (LEPECVD) is a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique used for the epitaxial deposition of thin semiconductor (silicon, germanium and SiGe alloys) films. A remote low energy, high density DC argon plasma is employed to efficiently decompose the gas phase precursors while leaving the epitaxial layer undamaged, resulting in high quality epilayers and high deposition rates (up to 10 nm/s).  Working principle  The substrate (typically a silicon wafer) is inserted in the reactor chamber, where it is heated by a graphite resistive heater from the backside. An argon plasma is introduced into the chamber to ionize the precursors' molecules, generating highly reactive radicals which result in the growth of an epilayer on the substrate. Moreover, the bombardment of Ar ions removes the hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the surface of the substrate while introducing no structural damage. The high reactivity of the radicals and the removal of hydrogen from the surface by ion bombardment prevent the typical problems of Si, Ge and SiGe alloys growth by thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), which are * dependence of the growth rate from the substrate temperature, due to the thermal energy needed for precursors decomposition and hydrogen desorption from the substrate * high temperatures (>1000 ¬∞C for silicon) required to get a significant growth rate, which is strongly limited by the aforementioned effects * strong dependence of the deposition rate on the SiGe alloy composition, due to the large difference between the hydrogen desorption rate from Si and Ge surfaces. Thanks to this effects the growth rate in a LEPECVD reactor depends only on the plasma parameters and the gas fluxes, and it is possible to obtain epitaxial deposition at much lower temperatures compared to a standard CVD tool.  LEPECVD reactor  Sketch of a typical LEPECVD reactor. The LEPECVD reactor is divided in three main parts: * a loadlock, to load the substrates into the chamber without breaking the vacuum * the main chamber, which is kept in UHV at a base pressure of ~10^{-9} mbar * the plasma source, where the plasma is generated. The substrate is placed at the top of the chamber, facing down toward the plasma source. Heating is provided from the back side by thermal radiation from a resistive graphite heater incapsulated between two boron nitride discs, which improve the temperature uniformity across the heater. Thermocouples are used to measure the temperature above the heater, which is then correlated to that of the substrate by a calibration done with an infrared pyrometer. Typical substrate temperatures for monocrystalline films are 400 ¬∞C to 760 ¬∞C, for germanium and silicon respectively. The potential of the wafer stage can be controlled by an external power supply, influencing the amount and the energy of radicals impinging on the surface, and is typically kept at 10-15 V with respect to the chamber walls. The process gases are introduced into the chamber through a gas dispersal ring placed below the wafer stage. The gases used in a LEPECVD reactor are silane () and germane () for silicon and germanium deposition respectively, together with diborane () and phosphine () for p- and n-type doping. = Plasma source = The plasma source is the most critical component of a LEPECVD reactor, as the low energy, high density, plasma is the key difference from a typical PECVD deposition system. The plasma is generated in a source which is attached to the bottom of the chamber. Argon is fed directly in the source, where tantalum filaments are heated to create an electron-rich environment by thermionic emission. The plasma is then ignited by a DC discharge from the heated filaments to the grounded walls of the source. Thanks to the high electron density in the source the voltage required to obtain a discharge is around 20-30V, resulting in an ion energy of about 10-20 eV, while the discharge current is of the order of several tens of amperes, giving a high ion density. The DC discharge current can be tuned to control the ion density, thus changing the growth rate: in particular at a larger discharge current the ion density is higher, therefore increasing the rate. = Plasma confinement = The plasma enters the growth chamber through an anode electrically connected to the grounded chamber walls, which is used to focus and stabilize the discharge and the plasma. Further focusing is provided by a magnetic field directed along the chamber's axis, provided by external copper coils wrapped around the chamber. The current flowing through the coils (i.e. the intensity of the magnetic field) can be controlled to change the ion density at the substrate's surface, thus changing the growth rate. Additional coils (\\"wobblers\\") are placed around the chamber, with their axis perpendicular to the magnetic field, to continuously sweep the plasma over the substrate, improving the homogenuity of the deposited film.  Applications  Thanks to the possibility of changing the growth rate (through the plasma density or gas fluxes) independently from the substrate temperature, both thin films with sharp interfaces and a precision down to the nanometer scale at rates as low as 0.4 nm/s, as well as thick layers (up to 10 um or more) at rates as high as 10 nm/s, can be grown using the same reactor and in the same deposition process. This has been exploited to grow low-loss composition-graded waveguides for NIR and MIR and integrated nanostructures (i.e. quantum well stacks) for NIR optical amplitude modulation. The capability of LEPECVD to grow both very sharp quantum wells on thick buffers in the same deposition step has also been employed to realize high mobility strained Ge channels. Another promising application of the LEPECVD technique is the possibility of growing high aspect ratio, self- assembled silicon and germanium microcrystals on deeply patterned Si substrates. This solves many problems related to heteroepitaxy (i.e. thermal expansion coefficient and crystal lattice mismatch), leading to very high crystal quality, and is possible thanks to the high rates and low temperatures found in a LEPECVD reactor.

The QRS complex represents the ventricular depolarization and the main spike visible in an ECG signal (see figure). This feature makes it particularly suitable for measuring heart rate, the first way to assess the heart health state. In the first derivation of Einthoven of a physiological heart, the QRS complex is composed by a downward deflection (Q wave), a high upward deflection (R wave) and a final downward deflection (S wave). The Pan‚ÄìTompkins algorithm applies a series of filters to highlight the frequency content of this rapid heart depolarization and removes the background noise. Then, it squares the signal to amplify the QRS contribute. Finally, it applies adaptive thresholds to detect the peaks of the filtered signal. The algorithm was proposed by Jiapu Pan and Willis J. Tompkins in 1985, in the journal IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. The performance of the method was tested on an annotated arrhythmia database (MIT/BIH) and evaluated also in presence of noise. Pan and Tompkins reported that the 99.3 percent of QRS complexes was correctly detected.  Pre- processing  Block diagram of the pre-processing phase of the Pan‚ÄìTompkins algorithm. = Noise cancellation = As a first step, a band-pass filter is applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. A filter bandwidth of 5-15 Hz is suggested to maximize the QRS contribute and reduce muscle noise, baseline wander, powerline interference and the P wave/T wave frequency content. In the original algorithm proposed in 1985, the band-pass filter was obtained with a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter in cascade to reduce the computational cost and allow a real-time detection, while ensuring a 3 dB passband in the 5‚Äì12 Hz frequency range, reasonably close to the design goal. For a signal sampled at a frequency of 200 Hz, Pan and Tompkins suggested the filters with the following transfer functions H(z) in an updated version of their article: * H(z)={(1-z^{-6})^{2} \\\\over (1-z^{-1})^{2}} for a second-order low-pass filter with a gain of 36 and a processing delay of 6 samples; * H(z)={(-1/32+z^{-16}-z^{-17}+z^{-32}/32)\\\\over(1-z^{-1})}for a high-pass filter with a unitary gain and a processing delay of 16 samples. = Derivative step = As a third step, a derivative filter is applied to provide information about the slope of the QRS. For a signal sampled at 200 Hz, Pan and Tompkins suggested the following transfer function: H(z)=0.1(-2z^{-2}-z^{-1}+z^{1}+2z^{2})for a 5-point derivative filter with gain of 0.1 and a processing delay of 2 samples. = Squaring and integration = The filtered signal is squared to enhance the dominant peaks (QRSs) and reduce the possibility of erroneously recognizing a T wave as an R peak. Then, a moving average filter is applied to provide information about the duration of the QRS complex. The number of samples to average is chosen in order to average on windows of 150 ms. The signal so obtained is called integrated signal.  Decision rules  Example of Pan‚ÄìTompkins processing. = Fiducial mark = In order to detect a QRS complex, the local peaks of the integrated signal are found. A peak is defined as the point in which the signal changes direction (from an increasing direction to a decreasing direction). After each peak, no peak can be detected in the next 200 ms (ie. the lockout time). This is a physiological constraint due to the refractory period during which ventricular depolarization cannot occur even in the presence of a stimulus. = Thresholds = Each fiducial mark is considered as a potential QRS. To reduce the possibility of wrongly selecting a noise peak as a QRS, each peak amplitude is compared to a threshold (ThresholdI) that takes into account the available information about already detected QRS and the noise level: Threshold_I= NoiseLevel_I + 0.25 (SignalLevel_I - NoiseLevel_I) where NoiseLevelI is the running estimate of the noise level in the integrated signal and SignalLevelI is the running estimate of the signal level in the integrated signal. The threshold is automatically updated after detecting a new peak, based on its classification as signal or noise peak: SignalLevel_I = 0.125 PEAK_I + 0.875 SignalLevel_I (if PEAKI is a signal peak) NoiseLevel_I = 0.125 PEAK_I + 0.875 NoiseLevel_I (if PEAKI is a noise peak) where PEAKI is the new peak found in the integrated signal. At the beginning of the QRS detection, a 2 seconds learning phase is needed to initialize SignalLevelI and NoiseLevelI as a percentage of the maximum and average amplitude of the integrated signal, respectively. If a new PEAKI is under the ThresholdI, the noise level is updated. If PEAKI is above the ThresholdI, the algorithm implements a further check before confirming the peak as a true QRS, taking into consideration the information provided by the bandpass filtered signal. In the filtered signal the peak corresponding to the one evaluated on the integrated signal is searched and compared with a threshold, calculated in a similar way to the previous step: Threshold_F= NoiseLevel_F + 0.25 (SignalLevel_F - NoiseLevel_F) SignalLevel_F = 0.125 PEAK_F + 0.875 SignalLevel_F (if PEAKF is a signal peak) NoiseLevel_F = 0.125 PEAK_F + 0.875 NoiseLevel_F (if PEAKF is a noise peak) where the final F stands for filtered signal. = Search back for missed QRS complexes = The algorithm takes into account the possibility of setting too high values of ThresholdII and ThresholdIF. A check is performed to continuously assess the RR intervals (namely the temporal interval between two consecutively QRS peaks) to overcome this issue. The average RR is computed in two ways to consider both regular and irregular heart rhythm. In the first method RRaverage1 is computed as the mean of the last RR intervals. In the second method RRaverage2 is computed as the mean of the last RR intervals that fell between the limits specified as: RRlow = 92% RRaverage2 RRhigh = 116% RRaverage2 If no QRS is detected in a window of 166% of the average RR (RRaverage1 or RRaverage2, if the heart rhythm is regular or irregular, respectively), the algorithm adds the maximal peak in the window as a potential QRS and classify it considering half the values of the thresholds (both ThresholdII and ThresholdIF). This check is implemented because the temporal distance between two consecutive beats cannot physiologically change more quickly than this. = T wave discrimination = The algorithm takes particularly into consideration the possibility of a false detection of T waves. If a potential QRS falls up to a 160 ms window after the refractory periody from the last correctly detected QRS complex, the algorithm evaluates if it could be a T wave with particular high amplitude. In this case, its slope is compared to the one of the precedent QRS complex. If the slope is less than half the previous one, the current QRS is recognized as a T wave and discarded, and it also updates the NoiseLevel (both in the filtered signal and the integrated signal).  Application  Once the QRS complex is successfully recognized, the heart rate is computed as a function of the distance in seconds between two consecutive QRS complexes (or R peaks): HR[bpm]={60 \\\\over RR[s]} where bpm stands for beats per minute. The HR is often used to compute the heart rate variability (HRV) a measure of the variability of the time interval between heartbeats. HRV is often used in the clinical field to diagnose and monitor pathological conditions and their treatment, but also in the affective computing research to study new methods to assess the emotional state of people.

During the process, fine powder particles are accelerated in a high-velocity compressed gas stream, and upon the impact on a substrate or backing plate, deform and bond together creating a layer. Moving the nozzle over a substrate repeatedly, a deposit is building up layer-by-layer, to form a part or component. If an industrial robot or computer controlled manipulator controls the spray gun movements, complex shapes can be created. To achieve 3D shape, there are two different approaches. First to fix the substrate and move the cold spray gun/nozzle using a robotic arm, the second one is to move the substrate with a robotic arm, and keep the spray-gun nozzle fixed. There is also a possibility to combine these two approaches either using two robotic arms or other manipulators. The process always requires a substrates as starting plate and uses only powder as raw material. This technique is distinct from selective laser melting or electron-beam additive manufacturing or other additive manufacturing process using laser or electron beam for melting the feedstock materials. History The origins of the cold spray process goes back to the beginning of the 20th century, when it was developed and patented by Thurston. The process was further investigated by in the 1950s by Rocheville and was re- discovered in the 1980s at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Russian Academy of Science and developed as a coating technology. The process started to be employed for additive repair and fabrication of freeform structures, that can be considered as additive manufacturing, at the beginning of the 21st century, when the first commercial cold spray system was introduced in the market. Process Additive manufacturing employing the process of cold spraying and its benefits can be considered as a deposition process, capable to build freeform parts and structures at high rates. Since it is a solid-state coating deposition process, during the process no melting of the feedstock material (metal powder) occurs, there are no heat related distortion and no protective atmosphere required, which enables to build up structures layer-by-layer. Theoretically, it allows for manufacture without size limitations for fabricating individual components or repairing damaged components. The largest 3D printer or Additive Manufacturing machine utilizing cold spray can build parts up to 9√ó3√ó1.5 m. During the cold spray process, the impacting particles create the layer, whose thickness can differ, based on the spray gun travel speed against the substrate and the feedstock material feed rate, building the structure layer-by-layers. Materials In cold spraying, the principle of the process is based on plastic deformation of the feedstock powder particles, therefore it is suitable to deposit with this technique mainly pure metals and alloys, but also metallic glasses, metal matrix composites and in some cases polymers. The research and development activities recently focusing on a few most challenging materials for the aircraft, space and defence industry such as aluminum alloys, Nickel base superalloys, different steel grades and titanium alloys Applications =Space and aerospace applications= *Propellant tank additive manufacturing, exploiting the advantage of the process to deposit titanium and titanium alloys without melting the feedstock material. *Thrust chambers, combustion chambers and rocket nozzles, where the process gives the benefit of unlimited dimensions and combination of different materials, which is also utilized to create the channels for conformal cooling of these components. *The additive manufacturing repair developed for aircraft engine components is utilizing the solid state of the cold spray process, using 2 robotic arms and on-line 3D scanning to apply the deposit onto the complex geometry of a fan blade. *The Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing process is also applied for additive repair of gearboxes and other aircraft components. =Tool and mould making= Forming, casting and stamping tools with conformal cooling and heating conducting elements, enabling shorter cycle times and significantly longer lifetime of these tools =Defence applications= Titanium drones manufactured by Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing =Other applications= *Titanium tubes and other direct manufactured components *Permanent magnets for electric motors, deposited directly to the motor housing using the Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing technique, leading to reduced cost and providing greater freedom in the design process Difference from other AM methods The most significant differences between the Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing process and other additive manufacturing processes are the low temperature, solid state of the process, avoiding melting the feedstock material. =Benefits= *Very high deposition rates, up to 20 kg/h depending on the material density. *No protective atmosphere required. *Possibility to connect or combine dissimilar materials, such as metals with different melting point. *Build-up dimensions limited only by the spray-gun and/or component manipulator. *Capable to deposit almost all metals & alloys. *The process has low energy consumption and produces no toxic waste. *Possibility to collect and reuse 100% of particles (actual recovery rates unknown). *Application of several powder feeders permits to perform separate injection of different materials in case of deposition of multicomponent deposits. =Drawbacks= *The process resolution is limited due to the \\"spray spot\\" size, which is usually of several millimeter. *Due to the severe plastic deformation of the particles, residual stresses in the deposit can accumulate, leading to distortion, deformation or cracks. *To reach the mechanical properties of the additive manufactured components, comparable to bulk material properties, post treatment of the component might be required.

The VMS framework has been mainly applied to design stabilized finite element methods in which stability of the standard Galerkin method is not ensured both in terms of singular perturbation and of compatibility conditions with the finite element spaces. Stabilized methods are getting increasing attention in computational fluid dynamics because they are designed to solve drawbacks typical of the standard Galerkin method: advection-dominated flows problems and problems in which an arbitrary combination of interpolation functions may yield to unstable discretized formulations. The milestone of stabilized methods for this class of problems can be considered the Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method (SUPG), designed during 80s for convection dominated-flows for the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations by Brooks and Hughes. Variational Multiscale Method (VMS) was introduced by Hughes in 1995. Broadly speaking, VMS is a technique used to get mathematical models and numerical methods which are able to catch multiscale phenomena; in fact, it is usually adopted for problems with huge scale ranges, which are separated into a number of scale groups. The main idea of the method is to design a sum decomposition of the solution as u = \\\\bar u + u' , where \\\\bar u is denoted as coarse-scale solution and it is solved numerically, whereas u' represents the fine scale solution and is determined analytically eliminating it from the problem of the coarse scale equation.

In particular, the following assumptions are made on these functions: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\bar u = g & & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma & & \\\\forall& \\\\bar u \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{V_g}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ u' = 0 & & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma & & \\\\forall& u' \\\\in {\\\\mathcal{V_g}}', \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar v = 0 & & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma & & \\\\forall& \\\\bar v \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal{V}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ v' = 0 & & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma & & \\\\forall& v' \\\\in {\\\\mathcal{V}}'. \\\\end{align} With this in mind, the variational form can be rewritten as : a(\\\\bar v + v', \\\\bar u + u') = f (\\\\bar v + v') and, by using bilinearity of a (\\\\cdot , \\\\cdot) and linearity of f (\\\\cdot) , : a (\\\\bar v, \\\\bar u) + a (\\\\bar v, u') + a (v', \\\\bar u) + a(v', u') = f(\\\\bar v) + f (v'). Last equation, yields to a coarse scale and a fine scale problem: : \\\\text{find } \\\\bar u \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V}_g \\\\text{ and } u' \\\\in \\\\mathcal V' \\\\text{ such that: } : \\\\begin{align} & & a (\\\\bar v, \\\\bar u) + a (\\\\bar v, u') &= f(\\\\bar v) & & \\\\forall \\\\bar v \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V} & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\text{coarse-scale problem}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & & a (v', \\\\bar u) + a (v', u') &= f( v') & & \\\\forall v' \\\\in {\\\\mathcal V}' & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\text{fine-scale problem} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} or, equivalently, considering that a(v, u) = (v, \\\\mathcal L u) and f(v)=(v, f) : : \\\\text{find } \\\\bar u \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V}_g \\\\text{ and } u' \\\\in \\\\mathcal V' \\\\text{ such that: } : \\\\begin{align} & & (\\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u) + (\\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal L u') &= (\\\\bar v, f) & & \\\\forall \\\\bar v \\\\in \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & (v', \\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u) + (v', \\\\mathcal L u') &= ( v', f) & & \\\\forall v' \\\\in {\\\\mathcal V}'.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} By rearranging the second problem as (v', \\\\mathcal L u') = - (v', \\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f) , the corresponding Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation reads: : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal L u' = - (\\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f) & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ u' = 0 & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma \\\\end{cases} which shows that the fine scale solution u' depends on the strong residual of the coarse scale equation \\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f . The fine scale solution can be expressed in terms of \\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f through the Green's function G: \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb R \\\\text{ with } G=0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma \\\\times \\\\Gamma : : u'(y) = - \\\\int_\\\\Omega G(x, y) (\\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f )(x)\\\\,d \\\\Omega_x \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall y \\\\in \\\\Omega. Let \\\\delta be the Dirac delta function, by definition, the Green's function is found by solving \\\\forall y \\\\in \\\\Omega : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathcal L^* G(x, y) = \\\\delta (x-y) & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ G(x,y)=0 & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma \\\\end{cases} Moreover, it is possible to express u' in terms of a new differential operator \\\\mathcal M that approximates the differential operator \\\\- \\\\mathcal L^{-1} as : u' = \\\\mathcal M (\\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f), with \\\\mathcal M \\\\approx - \\\\mathcal L^{-1}. In order to eliminate the explicit dependence in the coarse scale equation of the sub-grid scale terms, considering the definition of the dual operator, the last expression can be substituted in the second term of the coarse scale equation: : (\\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal L u') = (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, u') = (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal M (\\\\mathcal L \\\\bar u - f)). Since \\\\mathcal M is an approximation of \\\\- \\\\mathcal L^{-1} , the Variational Multiscale Formulation will consist in finding an approximate solution \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} \\\\approx \\\\bar u instead of \\\\bar u . The coarse problem is therefore rewritten as: : \\\\text{find } \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{\\\\bar V}_g: \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; a (\\\\bar v, \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u}) + (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal M (\\\\mathcal L \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} - f)) = (\\\\bar v, f) \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; \\\\forall \\\\bar{v} \\\\in \\\\mathcal {\\\\bar V}, being : (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal M (\\\\mathcal L \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} - f)) = - \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v)(y) G(x, y) (\\\\mathcal L \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} - f)(x) \\\\,d \\\\Omega_x \\\\,d\\\\Omega_y. Introducing the form : B(\\\\bar v, \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u}, G) = a (\\\\bar v, \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u}) + (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal M (\\\\mathcal L \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u})) and the functional : L(\\\\bar v, G)= (\\\\bar v, f) + (\\\\mathcal L^* \\\\bar v, \\\\mathcal M f) , the VMS formulation of the coarse scale equation is rearranged as: : \\\\text{find } \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{\\\\bar V}_g: \\\\, B(\\\\bar v, \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u}, G) = L(\\\\bar v, G) \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall \\\\bar{v} \\\\in \\\\mathcal {\\\\bar V}. Since commonly it is not possible to determine both \\\\mathcal M and G , one usually adopt an approximation. In this sense, the coarse scale spaces \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V}_g and \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V} are chosen as finite dimensional space of functions as: : \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V}_g \\\\equiv \\\\mathcal V_{g_h} : = \\\\mathcal V_g \\\\cap X_r^h(\\\\Omega) and : \\\\bar{\\\\mathcal V} \\\\equiv \\\\mathcal V_{h} : = \\\\mathcal V \\\\cap X_h^r(\\\\Omega), being X_r^h(\\\\Omega) the Finite Element space of Lagrangian polynomials of degree r \\\\geq 1 over the mesh built in \\\\Omega . Note that \\\\mathcal{V}_g' and \\\\mathcal{V}' are infinite-dimensional spaces, while \\\\mathcal{V}_{g_h} and \\\\mathcal{V}_h are finite-dimensional spaces. Let u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_{g_h} and v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_{h} be respectively approximations of \\\\tilde{\\\\bar u} and {\\\\bar v} , and let \\\\tilde G and \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal M} be respectively approximations of G and {\\\\mathcal M}. The VMS problem with Finite Element approximation reads: : \\\\text{find } u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_{g_h}: B(v_h, u_h, \\\\tilde G) = L( v_h, \\\\tilde G) \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall {v}_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal { V}_h or, equivalently: : \\\\text{find } u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_{g_h}: a (v_h, u_h) + (\\\\mathcal L^* v_h, \\\\mathcal {\\\\tilde{M}} (\\\\mathcal L { u_h} - f)) = ( v_h, f) \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall {v}_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal { V}_h  VMS and stabilized methods  Consider an advection‚Äìdiffusion problem: : \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\mu \\\\Delta u + \\\\boldsymbol b \\\\cdot abla u = f & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ u=0 & \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega \\\\end{cases} where \\\\mu \\\\in \\\\mathbb R is the diffusion coefficient with \\\\mu>0 and \\\\boldsymbol b \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^d is a given advection field. Let \\\\mathcal{V}= H^1_0(\\\\Omega) and u \\\\in \\\\mathcal V , \\\\boldsymbol b \\\\in [L^2(\\\\Omega)]^d , f \\\\in L^2(\\\\Omega) . Let \\\\mathcal L = \\\\mathcal L_{diff} + \\\\mathcal L_{adv} , being \\\\mathcal L_{diff} = - \\\\mu \\\\Delta and \\\\mathcal L_{adv} = \\\\boldsymbol b \\\\cdot abla . The variational form of the problem above reads: : \\\\text{find} \\\\, u \\\\in \\\\mathcal V: \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; a(v, u) = (f, v) \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; \\\\forall v \\\\in \\\\mathcal V, being : a(v, u) = ( abla v, \\\\mu abla u) + (v, \\\\boldsymbol b \\\\cdot abla u). Consider a Finite Element approximation in space of the problem above by introducing the space \\\\mathcal V_h = \\\\mathcal V \\\\cap X_h^r over a grid \\\\Omega_h = \\\\bigcup_{k=1}^{N} \\\\Omega_k made of N elements, with u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_h . The standard Galerkin formulation of this problem reads : \\\\text{find } u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_h: \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; a(v_h, u_h) = (f, v_h) \\\\; \\\\; \\\\; \\\\forall v \\\\in \\\\mathcal V, Consider a strongly consistent stabilization method of the problem above in a finite element framework: : \\\\text{ find } u_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_h: \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, a(v_h, u_h) + \\\\mathcal L_h (u_h, f; v_h)= (f, v_h) \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_h for a suitable form \\\\mathcal L_h that satisfies: : \\\\mathcal L_h (u, f; v_h) = 0 \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, \\\\forall v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal V_h. The form \\\\mathcal L_h can be expressed as (\\\\mathbb L v_h, \\\\tau (\\\\mathcal L u_h - f))_{\\\\Omega_h} , being \\\\mathbb L a differential operator such as: : \\\\mathbb L= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\+ \\\\mathcal L & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, & \\\\text{ Galerkin/least squares (GLS)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\+ \\\\mathcal L_{adv} & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, & \\\\text{ Streamline Upwind Petrov- Galerkin (SUPG)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\- \\\\mathcal L^* & \\\\, \\\\, \\\\, & \\\\text{ Multiscale} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} and \\\\tau is the stabilization parameter. A stabilized method with \\\\mathbb L = -\\\\mathcal L^* is typically referred to multiscale stabilized method . In 1995, Thomas J.R. Hughes showed that a stabilized method of multiscale type can be viewed as a sub-grid scale model where the stabilization parameter is equal to : \\\\tau= - \\\\tilde{\\\\mathcal M} \\\\approx - \\\\mathcal M or, in terms of the Green's function as : \\\\tau \\\\delta (x-y) = \\\\tilde G(x, y) \\\\approx G(x,y), which yields the following definition of \\\\tau : : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Omega_k} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_k} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_k} G(x, y) \\\\,d\\\\Omega_x \\\\,d\\\\Omega_y.  VMS turbulence modeling for large-eddy simulations of incompressible flows  The idea of VMS turbulence modeling for Large Eddy Simulations(LES) of incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations was introduced by Hughes et al. in 2000 and the main idea was to use - instead of classical filtered techniques - variational projections. = Incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations = Consider the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for a Newtonian fluid of constant density \\\\rho in a domain \\\\Omega \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^d with boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega = \\\\Gamma_D \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_N , being \\\\Gamma_D and \\\\Gamma_N portions of the boundary where respectively a Dirichlet and a Neumann boundary condition is applied ( \\\\Gamma_D \\\\cap \\\\Gamma_N = \\\\emptyset ): : \\\\begin{cases} \\\\rho \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\rho (\\\\boldsymbol u \\\\cdot abla) \\\\boldsymbol u - abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma (\\\\boldsymbol u, p) = \\\\boldsymbol f & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0, T) \\\\\\\\\\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol u = 0 & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0, T) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol u = \\\\boldsymbol g & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma_D \\\\times (0, T) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma (\\\\boldsymbol u, p) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat n} = \\\\boldsymbol h & \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma_N \\\\times (0, T) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol u(0)= \\\\boldsymbol u_0 & \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\\\\\{ 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{cases} being \\\\boldsymbol u the fluid velocity, p the fluid pressure, \\\\boldsymbol f a given forcing term, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\hat n} the outward directed unit normal vector to \\\\Gamma_N , and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma (\\\\boldsymbol u, p) the viscous stress tensor defined as: : \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma (\\\\boldsymbol u, p) = -p \\\\boldsymbol I + 2 \\\\mu \\\\boldsymbol \\\\epsilon (\\\\boldsymbol u). Let \\\\mu be the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, \\\\boldsymbol I the second order identity tensor and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\epsilon (\\\\boldsymbol u) the strain-rate tensor defined as: : \\\\boldsymbol \\\\epsilon (\\\\boldsymbol u) = \\\\frac{1}{2} (( abla \\\\boldsymbol u) + ( abla \\\\boldsymbol u)^T). The functions \\\\boldsymbol g and \\\\boldsymbol h are given Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data, while \\\\boldsymbol u_0 is the initial condition. = Global space time variational formulation = In order to find a variational formulation of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, consider the following infinite-dimensional spaces: : \\\\mathcal V_g= \\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol u \\\\in [H^1(\\\\Omega)]^d : \\\\boldsymbol u = \\\\boldsymbol g \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma_D \\\\\\\\}, : \\\\mathcal V_0 = [H^1_0(\\\\Omega)]^d=\\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol u \\\\in [H^1(\\\\Omega)]^d : \\\\boldsymbol u = \\\\boldsymbol 0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\Gamma_D \\\\\\\\}, : \\\\mathcal Q =L^2(\\\\Omega). Furthermore, let \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_g = \\\\mathcal V_g \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_0 = \\\\mathcal V_0 \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q . The weak form of the unsteady-incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations reads: given \\\\boldsymbol u_{0}, : \\\\forall t \\\\in (0, T), \\\\; \\\\text{find } (\\\\boldsymbol u, p) \\\\in \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_g \\\\text{ such that } : \\\\begin{align} \\\\bigg( \\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\rho \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol u}{\\\\partial t}\\\\bigg) + a (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol u) + c (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol u, \\\\boldsymbol u) - b (\\\\boldsymbol v, p) + b (\\\\boldsymbol u, q) = (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol f) + (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol h)_{\\\\Gamma_N} \\\\; \\\\; \\\\forall (\\\\boldsymbol v, q) \\\\in \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_0 \\\\end{align} where (\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) represents the L^2(\\\\Omega) inner product and (\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot)_{\\\\Gamma_N} the L^2(\\\\Gamma_N) inner product. Moreover, the bilinear forms a(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) , b(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) and the trilinear form c(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) are defined as follows: : \\\\begin{align} a (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol u) = & ( abla \\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\mu (( abla \\\\boldsymbol u) + ( abla \\\\boldsymbol u)^T)), \\\\\\\\\\\\ b (\\\\boldsymbol v, q) = &( abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol v, q), \\\\\\\\\\\\ c (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol u, \\\\boldsymbol u) = &(\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\rho (\\\\boldsymbol u \\\\cdot abla) \\\\boldsymbol u). \\\\end{align} =Finite element method for space discretization and VMS-LES modeling= In order to discretize in space the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, consider the function space of finite element : X_r^h = \\\\\\\\{u^h \\\\in C^0 (\\\\overline\\\\Omega): u^h_k \\\\in \\\\mathbb P_r, \\\\; \\\\forall k \\\\in \\\\Tau_h\\\\\\\\} of piecewise Lagrangian Polynomials of degree r \\\\geq 1 over the domain \\\\Omega triangulated with a mesh \\\\Tau_h made of tetrahedrons of diameters h_k , \\\\forall k \\\\in \\\\Tau_h . Following the approach shown above, let introduce a multiscale direct-sum decomposition of the space \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V which represents either \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_g and \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_0: : \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V = \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_h \\\\oplus \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V', being : \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_h = \\\\mathcal V_{g_h} \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q \\\\text{ or } \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_h = \\\\mathcal V_{0_h} \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q the finite dimensional function space associated to the coarse scale, and : \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V' = \\\\mathcal V_g' \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q \\\\text{ or } \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V' = \\\\mathcal V_0' \\\\times \\\\mathcal Q the infinite-dimensional fine scale function space, with : \\\\mathcal V_{g_h} = \\\\mathcal V_g \\\\cap X_r^h , : \\\\mathcal V_{0_h} = \\\\mathcal V_0 \\\\cap X_r^h and : \\\\mathcal Q_h = \\\\mathcal Q \\\\cap X_r^h . An overlapping sum decomposition is then defined as: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\boldsymbol u = \\\\boldsymbol u^h + \\\\boldsymbol u' \\\\text{ and } p = p^h + p' \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\boldsymbol v = \\\\boldsymbol v^h + \\\\boldsymbol v' \\\\;\\\\text{ and } q = q^h + q' \\\\end{align} By using the decomposition above in the variational form of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, one gets a coarse and a fine scale equation; the fine scale terms appearing in the coarse scale equation are integrated by parts and the fine scale variables are modeled as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol u' \\\\approx & -\\\\tau_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h), \\\\\\\\\\\\ p' \\\\approx & -\\\\tau_C (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_C (\\\\boldsymbol u^h). \\\\end{align} In the expressions above, \\\\boldsymbol r_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) and \\\\boldsymbol r_C (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) are the residuals of the momentum equation and continuity equation in strong forms defined as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol r_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) = & \\\\rho \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol u^h}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\rho (\\\\boldsymbol u^h \\\\cdot abla) \\\\boldsymbol u^h - abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol \\\\sigma (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) - \\\\boldsymbol f,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol r_C (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) = & abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol u^h, \\\\end{align} while the stabilization parameters are set equal to: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tau_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) = & \\\\bigg ( \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2 \\\\rho^2}{\\\\Delta t^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2 }{h_k^2} \\\\boldsymbol u^h^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{h_k^4}C_r\\\\bigg )^{-1/2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tau_C (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) = & \\\\frac{h_k^2}{\\\\tau_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h) }, \\\\end{align} where C_r = 60 \\\\cdot 2^{r-2} is a constant depending on the polynomials's degree r , \\\\sigma is a constant equal to the order of the backward differentiation formula (BDF) adopted as temporal integration scheme and \\\\Delta t is the time step. The semi-discrete variational multiscale multiscale formulation (VMS-LES) of the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, reads: given \\\\boldsymbol u_{0}, : \\\\forall t \\\\in (0, T), \\\\; \\\\text{find } \\\\boldsymbol U^h = \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h\\\\\\\\} \\\\in \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_{g_h} \\\\text{ such that } A(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h ) = F(\\\\boldsymbol V^h) \\\\; \\\\; \\\\forall \\\\boldsymbol V^h= \\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol v^h, q^h\\\\\\\\} \\\\in \\\\boldsymbol \\\\mathcal V_{0_h}, being : A(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h ) = A^{NS}(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h ) + A^{VMS}(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h ), and : F(\\\\boldsymbol V^h) = (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol f) + (\\\\boldsymbol v, \\\\boldsymbol h)_{\\\\Gamma_N}. The forms A^{NS}(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) and A^{VMS}(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) are defined as: : \\\\begin{align} A^{NS}(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h )= & \\\\bigg( \\\\boldsymbol v^h, \\\\rho \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol u^h}{\\\\partial t}\\\\bigg) + a (\\\\boldsymbol v^h, \\\\boldsymbol u^h) + c (\\\\boldsymbol v^h, \\\\boldsymbol u^h, \\\\boldsymbol u^h) - b (\\\\boldsymbol v^h, p^h) + b (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, q^h), \\\\\\\\\\\\ A^{VMS}(\\\\boldsymbol V^h, \\\\boldsymbol U^h ) = & \\\\underbrace{\\\\big( \\\\rho \\\\boldsymbol u^h \\\\cdot abla \\\\boldsymbol v^h + abla q^h, \\\\tau_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) \\\\big)}_{\\\\text{SUPG}} - \\\\underbrace{( abla \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol v^h, \\\\tau_c(\\\\boldsymbol u_h)\\\\boldsymbol r_C(\\\\boldsymbol u^h)) + \\\\big( \\\\rho \\\\boldsymbol u^h \\\\cdot ( abla \\\\boldsymbol u^h)^T, \\\\tau_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_M (\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) \\\\big )}_{\\\\text{VMS}} - \\\\underbrace{( abla \\\\boldsymbol v^h, \\\\tau_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) \\\\otimes \\\\tau_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h) \\\\boldsymbol r_M(\\\\boldsymbol u^h, p^h) )}_{\\\\text{LES}}. \\\\end{align} From the expressions above, one can see that: * the form A^{NS}(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) contains the standard terms of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in variational formulation; * the form A^{VMS}(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot) contain four terms: # the first term is the classical SUPG stabilization term; # the second term represents a stabilization term additional to the SUPG one; # the third term is a stabilization term typical of the VMS modeling; # the fourth term is peculiar of the LES modeling, describing the Reynolds cross-stress.

The finite element (FE) numerical computation of incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations (NS) suffers from two main sources of numerical instabilities arising from the associated Galerkin problem. Equal order finite elements for pressure and velocity, (for example, \\\\mathbb{P}_k-\\\\mathbb{P}_k, \\\\; \\\\forall k \\\\ge 0 ), do not satisfy the inf-sup condition and leads to instability on the discrete pressure (also called spurious pressure). Moreover, the advection term in the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations can produce oscillations in the velocity field (also called spurious velocity). Such spurious velocity oscillations become more evident for advection-dominated (i.e., high Reynolds number Re ) flows. To control instabilities arising from inf-sup condition and convection dominated problem, pressure-stabilizing Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin (PSPG) stabilization along with Streamline-Upwind Petrov- Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization can be added to the NS Galerkin formulation.

Hence, the strong formulation of the incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations for a constant density, Newtonian and homogeneous fluid can be written as: Find, \\\\forall t \\\\in (0,T] , velocity \\\\bold u(\\\\bold{x},t) and pressure p(\\\\bold{x},t) such that: \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t}+( \\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u + abla \\\\hat p -2 u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u)=\\\\bold 0 & \\\\text{in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0,T], \\\\\\\\\\\\ abla \\\\cdot {\\\\bold u}=0 & \\\\text{in } \\\\Omega \\\\times (0,T], \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left( - \\\\hat p \\\\bold{I} +2 u \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) \\\\right) \\\\bold{\\\\hat{n}} = \\\\bold h & \\\\text{on } \\\\Gamma_N \\\\times (0,T], \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bold u = \\\\bold g & \\\\text{on } \\\\Gamma_D \\\\times (0,T] \\\\;, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bold{u} (\\\\bold{x},0) = \\\\bold u_0(\\\\bold{x}) & \\\\text{in } \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\end{cases} where, u=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\rho} is the kinematic viscosity, and \\\\hat p=\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} is the pressure rescaled by density ( however, for the sake of clearness, the hat on pressure variable will be neglect in what follows). In the NS equations, the Reynolds number shows how important is the non linear term, ( \\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u , compared to the dissipative term, u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u): \\\\frac{( \\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u}{ u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u)}\\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\frac{U^2}{L}}{ u\\\\frac{U}{L^2}}=\\\\frac{UL}{ u}=Re. The Reynolds number is a measure of the ratio between the advection convection terms, generated by inertial forces in the flow velocity, and the diffusion term specific of fluid viscous forces. Thus, Re can be used to discriminate between advection-convection dominated flow and diffusion dominated one. Namely: :* for \\"low\\" Re , viscous forces dominate and we are in the viscous fluid situation (also named Laminar Flow), :* for \\"high\\" Re , inertial forces prevail and a slightly viscous fluid with high velocity emerges (also named Turbulent Flow). =The weak formulation of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations= The weak formulation of the strong formulation of the NS equations is obtained by multiplying the first two NS equations by test functions \\\\bold v and q , respectively, belonging to suitable function spaces, and integrating these equation all over the fluid domain \\\\Omega . As a consequence: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t}\\\\cdot \\\\bold v\\\\,d\\\\Omega+ \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}(\\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega + \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla p \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega\\\\,-\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}2 u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold u \\\\, q \\\\,d\\\\Omega=0. \\\\end{align} By summing up the two equations and performing integration by parts for pressure ( abla p ) and viscous ( abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S (\\\\bold u) ) term: \\\\begin{align} & \\\\int_\\\\Omega \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t}\\\\cdot \\\\bold v\\\\,d\\\\Omega+ \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}(\\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega\\\\, +\\\\int_\\\\Omega abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold u \\\\, q \\\\,d\\\\Omega- \\\\int_{\\\\Omega}p abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega+\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}p \\\\bold v \\\\cdot \\\\bold{\\\\hat n} \\\\,d\\\\Gamma \\\\, \\\\+ \\\\int_\\\\Omega 2 u \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) : abla \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega-\\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}2 u \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\cdot \\\\bold{\\\\hat n} \\\\,d\\\\Gamma \\\\, =0. \\\\end{align} Regarding the choice of the function spaces, it's enough that p and q , \\\\bold u and \\\\bold v , and their derivative, abla \\\\bold u and abla \\\\bold v are square-integrable functionss in order to have sense in the integrals that appear in the above formulation. Hence, \\\\begin{align} & \\\\mathcal{Q}=L^2(\\\\Omega)=\\\\\\\\{ q \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\text{ s.t. } \\\\Vert q\\\\Vert_{L^2}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}{\\\\vert q \\\\vert^2 \\\\ d\\\\Omega}} < \\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathcal{V}=\\\\\\\\{ \\\\bold v \\\\in [L^2(\\\\Omega)]^3 \\\\text{ and } abla \\\\bold v \\\\in [L^2(\\\\Omega)]^{3 \\\\times 3}, \\\\, \\\\bold v_{\\\\Gamma_{D}}=\\\\bold g \\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\mathcal{V}_0=\\\\\\\\{ \\\\bold v \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\text{ s.t. } \\\\bold v_{\\\\Gamma_D}=\\\\bold 0\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} Having specified the function spaces \\\\mathcal{V} , \\\\mathcal{V}_0 and \\\\mathcal{Q} , and by applying the boundary conditions, the boundary terms can be rewritten as \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_D \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_N}p \\\\bold v \\\\cdot \\\\bold{\\\\hat n} \\\\,d\\\\Gamma+ \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_D \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_N} -2 u S(\\\\bold u) \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\cdot \\\\bold{\\\\hat n} \\\\,d\\\\Gamma, where \\\\partial \\\\Omega=\\\\Gamma_D \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_N . The integral terms with \\\\Gamma_D vanish because \\\\bold v_{\\\\Gamma_D}=\\\\bold 0 , while the term on \\\\Gamma_N become \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_{N}} [p \\\\bold I -2 u S(\\\\bold u)] \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\cdot \\\\bold{\\\\hat n} \\\\,d\\\\Gamma = -\\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_{N}} \\\\bold h \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Gamma, The weak formulation of Navier‚ÄìStokes equations reads: Find, for all t \\\\in (0,T] , (\\\\bold u,p)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Q}\\\\\\\\} , such that \\\\begin{align} & \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t},\\\\bold v \\\\right)+c(\\\\bold u,\\\\bold u,\\\\bold v)+b(\\\\bold u,q)-b(\\\\bold v,p) + a(\\\\bold u,\\\\bold v) = f(\\\\bold v) \\\\end{align} with \\\\bold{u}_{t=0}=\\\\bold{u}_0 , where \\\\begin{align} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t},\\\\bold v \\\\right):=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t}\\\\cdot \\\\bold v\\\\,d\\\\Omega, \\\\\\\\\\\\ b(\\\\bold u,q):=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold u \\\\, q \\\\,d\\\\Omega, \\\\\\\\\\\\ a(\\\\bold u,\\\\bold v):=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}2 u \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) : abla \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega, \\\\\\\\\\\\ c(\\\\bold w,\\\\bold u,\\\\bold v):=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}(\\\\bold w \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Omega, \\\\\\\\\\\\ f(\\\\bold v):=-\\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_{N}} \\\\bold h \\\\cdot \\\\bold v \\\\,d\\\\Gamma. \\\\end{align} Finite element Galerkin formulation of Navier‚ÄìStokes equations In order to numerically solve the NS problem, first the discretization of the weak formulation is performed. Consider a triangulation \\\\Omega_h , composed by tetrahedra \\\\mathcal{T}_i , with i=1,\\\\ldots,N_{\\\\mathcal{T}} (where N_{\\\\mathcal{T}} is the total number of tetrahedra), of the domain \\\\Omega and h is the characteristic length of the element of the triangulation. Introducing two families of finite- dimensional sub-spaces \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h , approximations of \\\\mathcal{V} and \\\\mathcal{Q} respectively, and depending on a discretization parameter h , with \\\\dim \\\\mathcal{V}_h = N_V and \\\\dim \\\\mathcal{Q}_h = N_Q , \\\\mathcal{V}_h \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{V} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathcal{Q}_h \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{Q}, the discretized-in-space Galerkin problem of the weak NS equation reads: Find, for all t \\\\in (0,T] , (\\\\bold u_h,p_h)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{V}_{h} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Q}_h\\\\\\\\} , such that \\\\begin{align} & \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u_h}{\\\\partial t},\\\\bold v_h \\\\right)+c(\\\\bold u_h,\\\\bold u_h,\\\\bold v_h)+b(\\\\bold u_h,q_h)-b(\\\\bold v_h,p_h)+a(\\\\bold u_h,\\\\bold v_h)=f(\\\\bold v_h) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall \\\\bold v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_{0h} \\\\;\\\\;,\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall q_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}_h, \\\\end{align} with \\\\bold{u}_h_{t=0}=\\\\bold{u}_{h,0} , where \\\\bold{g}_{h} is the approximation (for example, his interpolant) of \\\\bold{g} , and \\\\mathcal{V}_{0h}=\\\\\\\\{ \\\\bold v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_h \\\\text{ s.t. } \\\\bold v_h_{\\\\Gamma_D}=\\\\bold 0\\\\\\\\}. Time discretization of discretized-in-space NS Galerkin problem can be performed, for example, by using the second order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF2), that is an implicit second order multistep method. Divide uniformly the finite time interval [0,T] into N_t time step of size \\\\delta t t_n=n\\\\delta t, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; n=0,1,2,\\\\ldots,N_t \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; N_t=\\\\frac{T}{\\\\delta t}. For a general function z , denoted by z^n as the approximation of z(t_n) . Thus, the BDF2 approximation of the time derivative reads as follows: \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u_h}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)^{n+1} \\\\simeq \\\\frac{ 3 \\\\bold u_h^{n+1} -4 \\\\bold u_h^{n}+ \\\\bold u_h^{n-1}}{2\\\\delta t} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\text{for } n \\\\geq 1. So, the fully discretized in time and space NS Galerkin problem is: Find, for n=0,1,\\\\ldots,N_t-1 , (\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,p^{n+1}_h)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{V}_{h} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Q}_h\\\\\\\\} , such that \\\\begin{align} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ 3 \\\\bold u_h^{n+1} -4 \\\\bold u_h^{n}+ \\\\bold u_h^{n-1}}{2\\\\delta t},\\\\bold v_h \\\\right) & \\\\+ c(\\\\bold u^*_h,\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,\\\\bold v_h)+b(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,q_h)-b(\\\\bold v_h,p_h^{n+1})+ a(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,\\\\bold v_h)=f(\\\\bold v_h), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall \\\\bold v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_{0h} \\\\;\\\\;,\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall q_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}_h, \\\\end{align} with \\\\bold{u}^{0}_h=\\\\bold{u}_{h,0} , and \\\\bold{u}^*_h is a quantity that will be detailed later in this section. The main issue of a fully implicit method for the NS Galerkin formulation is that the resulting problem is still non linear, due to the convective term, c(\\\\bold u^*_h,\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,\\\\bold v_h). Indeed, if \\\\bold{u}^*_h=\\\\bold{u}^{n+1}_h is put, this choice leads to solve a non-linear system (for example, by means of the Newton or Fixed point algorithm) with a huge computational cost. In order to reduce this cost, it is possible to use a semi-implicit approach with a second order extrapolation for the velocity, \\\\bold u^*_h , in the convective term: \\\\bold u^*_h=2\\\\bold u^{n}_h-\\\\bold u^{n-1}_h. =Finite element formulation and the INF-SUP condition= Let's define the finite element (FE) spaces of continuous functions, X_h^r (polynomials of degree r on each element \\\\mathcal{T}_i of the triangulation) as X_h^r= \\\\\\\\{ v_h \\\\in C^0(\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}) : v_h_{\\\\mathcal{T}_i} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}_r \\\\ \\\\forall \\\\mathcal{T}_i \\\\in \\\\Omega_h \\\\\\\\} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; r=0,1,2,\\\\ldots, where, \\\\mathbb{P}_r is the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to r . Introduce the finite element formulation, as a specific Galerkin problem, and choose \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h as \\\\mathcal{V}_h\\\\equiv [X_h^r]^3 \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathcal{Q}_h\\\\equiv X_h^s \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; r,s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}. The FE spaces \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h need to satisfy the inf-sup condition(or LBB): \\\\exists \\\\beta_h >0 \\\\;\\\\text{ s.t. } \\\\; \\\\inf_{q_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}_h}\\\\sup_{\\\\bold v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_h} \\\\frac{b(q_h,\\\\bold v_h)}{\\\\Vert \\\\bold v_h \\\\Vert_{H^1} \\\\Vert q_h \\\\Vert_{L^2}} \\\\geq \\\\beta_h \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall h>0, with \\\\beta_h >0 , and independent of the mesh size h. This property is necessary for the well posedness of the discrete problem and the optimal convergence of the method. Examples of FE spaces satisfying the inf- sup condition are the so named Taylor-Hood pair \\\\mathbb{P}_{k+1}-\\\\mathbb{P}_k (with k \\\\geq 1 ), where it can be noticed that the velocity space \\\\mathcal{V}_h has to be, in some sense, \\"richer\\" in comparison to the pressure space \\\\mathcal{Q}_h. Indeed, the inf-sup condition couples the space \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h , and it is a sort of compatibility condition between the velocity and pressure spaces. The equal order finite elements, \\\\mathbb{P}_{k}-\\\\mathbb{P}_k ( \\\\forall k ), do not satisfy the inf- sup condition and leads to instability on the discrete pressure (also called spurious pressure). However, \\\\mathbb{P}_{k}-\\\\mathbb{P}_k can still be used with additional stabilization terms such as Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin with a Pressure-Stabilizing Petrov-Galerkin term (SUPG-PSPG). In order to derive the FE algebraic formulation of the fully discretized Galerkin NS problem, it is necessary to introduce two basis for the discrete spaces \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h \\\\\\\\{ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i(\\\\bold x) \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{N_V} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi_k(\\\\bold x) \\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^{N_Q}, in order to expand our variables as \\\\bold u^n_h=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N_V} U^n_j \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j(\\\\bold x), \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; q^n_h=\\\\sum_{l=1}^{N_Q} P^n_l \\\\psi_l(\\\\bold x). The coefficients, U^n_j ( j=1,\\\\ldots,N_V ) and P^n_l ( l=1,\\\\ldots,N_Q ) are called degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of the finite element for the velocity and pressure field, respectively. The dimension of the FE spaces, N_V and N_Q , is the number of d.o.f, of the velocity and pressure field, respectively. Hence, the total number of d.o.f N_{d.o.f} is N_{d.o.f}=N_V+N_Q . Since the fully discretized Galerkin problem holds for all elements of the space \\\\mathcal{V}_h and \\\\mathcal{Q}_h , then it is valid also for the basis. Hence, choosing these basis functions as test functions in the fully discretized NS Galerkin problem, and using bilinearity of a(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) and b(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) , and trilinearity of c(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) , the following linear system is obtained: \\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle M \\\\frac{ 3 \\\\bold U^{n+1} -4 \\\\bold U^{n}+ \\\\bold U^{n-1}}{2\\\\delta t} + A\\\\bold U^{n+1} +C(\\\\bold U^*)\\\\bold U^{n+1}+\\\\displaystyle{B^T \\\\bold P^{n+1} = \\\\bold F^{n}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\displaystyle{B \\\\bold U^{n+1} = \\\\bold 0} \\\\end{cases} where M \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N_V \\\\times N_V} , A \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N_V \\\\times N_V} , C(\\\\bold U^*) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N_V \\\\times N_V} , B \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N_Q \\\\times N_V} , and F \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{N_V} are given by \\\\begin{align} & M_{ij}=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i d\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ & A_{ij}=a(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & C_{ij}(\\\\bold u^*)=c(\\\\bold u^*,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & B_{kj}=b(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j,\\\\psi_k), \\\\\\\\\\\\ & F_{i}=f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i) \\\\end{align} and \\\\bold U and \\\\bold P are the unknown vectors \\\\bold U^n=\\\\Big( U^n_1,\\\\ldots,U^n_{N_V} \\\\Big)^T, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\bold P^n=\\\\Big( P^n_1,\\\\ldots,P^n_{N_Q} \\\\Big)^T. Problem is completed by an initial condition on the velocity \\\\bold U(0)=\\\\bold U_0 . Moreover, using the semi- implicit treatment \\\\bold U^{*}=2\\\\bold U^{n}-\\\\bold U^{n-1} , the trilinear term c(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) becomes bilinear, and the corresponding matrix is C_{ij}=c(\\\\bold u^*,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i)=\\\\int_{\\\\Omega}(\\\\bold u^* \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_j \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}_i \\\\,d\\\\Omega, Hence, the linear system can be written in a single monolithic matrix ( \\\\Sigma , also called monolithic NS matrix) of the form \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} K & B^T \\\\\\\\\\\\ B & 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\bold U^{n+1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bold P^{n+1} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\bold F^n + \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\delta t}M(4 \\\\bold U^n -\\\\bold U^{n-1}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bold 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\Sigma=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} K & B^T \\\\\\\\\\\\ B & 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]. where K=\\\\frac{3}{2\\\\delta t}M+A+C(U^*) . Streamline upwind Petrov Galerkin formulation for incompressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations NS equations with finite element formulation suffer from two source of numerical instability, due to the fact that: :* NS is a convection dominated problem, which means \\"large\\" Re , where numerical oscillations in the velocity field can occur (spurious velocity); :* FE spaces \\\\mathbb{P}_k-\\\\mathbb{P}_k (\\\\forall k) are unstable combinations of velocity and pressure finite element spaces, that do not satisfy the inf-sup condition, and generates numerical oscillations in the pressure field (spurious pressure). To control instabilities arising from inf- sup condition and convection dominated problem, Pressure-Stabilizing Petrov- Galerkin(PSPG) stabilization along with Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization can be added to the NS Galerkin formulation. s(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h, p^{n+1}_h ;\\\\bold v_h, q_h)=\\\\gamma \\\\sum_{\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\in \\\\Omega_h} \\\\tau_{\\\\mathcal{T}} \\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{T}}\\\\left[ \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h, p^{n+1}) \\\\right]^T \\\\mathcal{L}_{ss}(\\\\bold v_h, q_h)d\\\\mathcal{T}, where \\\\gamma>0 is a positive constant, \\\\tau_{\\\\mathcal{T}} is a stabilization parameter, \\\\mathcal{T} is a generic tetrahedron belonging to the finite elements partitioned domain \\\\Omega_h , \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u, p) is the residual of the NS equations. \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u, p)=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bold u}{\\\\partial t}+ (\\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u + abla p -2 u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u) \\\\\\\\\\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold u \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right], and \\\\mathcal{L}_{ss}(\\\\bold u, p) is the skew-symmetric part of the NS equations \\\\mathcal{L}_{ss}(\\\\bold u, p)=\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} (\\\\bold u \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u + abla p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bold 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]. The skew- symmetric part of a generic operator \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u, p) is the one for which \\\\Bigl( \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u, p),(\\\\bold v, q) \\\\Bigr )=-\\\\Bigl( (\\\\bold v, q), \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\bold u, p) \\\\Bigr ). Since it is based on the residual of the NS equations, the SUPG-PSPG is a strongly consistent stabilization method. The discretized finite element Galerkin formulation with SUPG-PSPG stabilization can be written as: Find, for all t=0,1,\\\\ldots,N_t-1, (\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,p^{n+1}_h)\\\\in \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{V}_{h} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{Q}_h\\\\\\\\} , such that \\\\begin{align} &\\\\left( \\\\frac{ 3 \\\\bold u_h^{n+1} -4 \\\\bold u_h^{n}+ \\\\bold u_h^{n-1}}{2\\\\delta t},\\\\bold v_h \\\\right) + c(\\\\bold u^*_h,\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,\\\\bold v_h)+b(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,q_h)-b(\\\\bold v_h,p^{n+1}_h) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; +a(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h,\\\\bold v_h)+s(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h, p^{n+1}_h ;\\\\bold v_h, q_h)=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall \\\\bold v_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{V}_{0h} \\\\;\\\\;,\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall q_h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Q}_h, \\\\end{align} with \\\\bold{u}^{0}_h=\\\\bold{u}_{h,0} , where \\\\begin{align} s(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h, p^{n+1}_h ;\\\\bold v_h, q_h) &=\\\\gamma \\\\sum_{\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\in \\\\Omega_h} \\\\tau_{M,\\\\mathcal{T}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{3 \\\\bold u_h^{n+1} -4 \\\\bold u_h^{n}+ \\\\bold u_h^{n-1}}{2\\\\delta t} \\\\+ (\\\\bold u_h^* \\\\cdot abla ) \\\\bold u_h^{n+1}+ abla p^{n+1}_{h}+ \\\\right. \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\left. -2 u abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold S(\\\\bold u^{n+1}_h) \\\\; \\\\boldsymbol{,} \\\\; u_h^* \\\\cdot abla \\\\bold v_h + \\\\frac{ abla q_h}{\\\\rho} \\\\right)_{\\\\mathcal{T}}+ \\\\gamma \\\\sum_{\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\in \\\\Omega_h} \\\\tau_{C,\\\\mathcal{T}}\\\\left( abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold u^{n+1}_h \\\\boldsymbol{,} \\\\; abla \\\\cdot \\\\bold v_h \\\\right)_{\\\\mathcal{T}}, \\\\end{align} and \\\\tau_{M,\\\\mathcal{T}} , and \\\\tau_{C,\\\\mathcal{T}} are two stabilization parameters for the momentum and the continuity NS equations, respectively. In addition, the notation \\\\left( a \\\\boldsymbol{,} \\\\; b \\\\right)_{\\\\mathcal{T}}=\\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{T}}ab \\\\; d\\\\mathcal{T} has been introduced, and \\\\bold u^*_h was defined in agreement with the semi-implicit treatment of the convective term. In the previous expression of s \\\\left( \\\\cdot ; \\\\cdot \\\\right) , the term \\\\sum_{\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\in \\\\Omega_h} \\\\tau_{M,\\\\mathcal{T}} \\\\left( abla p^{n+1}_{h} \\\\boldsymbol{,} \\\\; \\\\frac{ abla q_h}{\\\\rho} \\\\right)_{\\\\mathcal{T}}, is the Brezzi-Pitkaranta stabilization for the inf-sup, while the term \\\\sum_{\\\\mathcal{T} \\\\in \\\\Omega_h} \\\\tau_{M,\\\\mathcal{T}} \\\\left( u_h^* \\\\cdot abla \\\\bold u^{n+1}_h \\\\boldsymbol{,} \\\\; u_h^* \\\\cdot abla \\\\bold v_h \\\\right)_{\\\\mathcal{T}}, corresponds to the streamline diffusion term stabilization for large Re . The other terms occur to obtain a strongly consistent stabilization.

The most general layout comprises two electrodes, operating as anode and cathode, connected to a power source. When an energy input and sufficient supporting electrolyte are provided to the system, strong oxidizing species are formed, which interact with the contaminants and degrade them. The refractory compounds are thus converted into reaction intermediates and, ultimately, into water and CO2 by complete mineralization. Electro-oxidation has recently grown in popularity thanks to its ease of set-up and effectiveness in treating harmful and recalcitrant organic pollutants, which are typically difficult to degrade with conventional wastewater remediation processes. Also, it does not require any external addition of chemicals (contrarily to other processes like in-situ chemical oxidation), as the required reactive species are generated at the anode surface. Electro-oxidation has been applied to treat a wide variety of harmful and non-biodegradable contaminants, including aromatics, pesticides, drugs and dyes. Due to its relatively high operating costs, it is often combined with other technologies, such as biological remediation.  Apparatus  alt= The set-up for performing an electro-oxidation treatment consists of an electrochemical cell. An external electric potential difference (aka voltage) is applied to the electrodes, resulting in the formation of reactive species, namely hydroxyl radicals, in the proximity of the electrode surface. To assure a reasonable rate of generation of radicals, voltage is adjusted to provide current density of 10-100 mA/cm2. While the cathodes materials are mostly the same in all cases, the anodes can vary greatly according to the application (see ), as the reaction mechanism is strongly influenced by the material selection. Cathodes are mostly made up by stainless steel plates, Platinum mesh or carbon felt electrodes. Depending on the effluent nature, an increase of the conductivity of the solution may be required: the value of 1000 mS/cm is commonly taken as a threshold. Salts like sodium chloride or sodium sulfate can be added to the solution, acting as electrolytes, thus raising the conductivity. Typical values of salts concentration are in the range of few grams per liter, but the addition has a significant impact on power consumption and can reduce it by up to 30%. As the main cost associated to electro-oxidation process is the consumption of electricity, its performance are typically assessed through two main parameters, namely current efficiency and specific energy consumption. Current efficiency is generally defined as the charge required for the oxidation of the considered species over the total charged passed during electrolysis. Although some expressions have been proposed to evaluate the instantaneous current efficiency, they have several limitations due to the presence of volatile intermediates or the need for specialized equipment. Thus, it is much easier to define a general current efficiency (GCE), defined as an average of the value of current efficiency along the entire process and formulated as follows: GCE=FV\\\\frac{(COD_0-COD_t)}{8It} Where COD0 and CODt are the chemical oxygen demand (g/dm3) at time 0 and after the treatment time t, F is the Faraday's constant (96'485 C/mol), V is the electrolyte volume (dm3), I is the current (A), t is the treatment time (h) and 8 is the oxygen equivalent mass. Current efficiency is a time dependent parameter and it decreases monotonically with treatment time. Instead, the specific energy consumption measures the energy required to remove a unit of COD from the solution and is typically expressed in kWh/kgCOD. It can be calculated according to: EC=\\\\frac{E_CIt}{(\\\\Delta COD)_tV_s} Where EC is the cell voltage (V), I is the current (A), t is the treatment time (h), (ŒîCOD)t is the COD decay at the end of the process (g/L) and Vs is the solute volume (L). As the current efficiency may vary significantly depending on the treated solution, one should always find the optimal compromise between current density, treatment time and the resulting specific energy consumption, so to meet the required removal efficiency.  Working principle  = Direct oxidation = When voltage is applied to the electrodes, intermediates of oxygen evolution are formed near the anode, notably hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are known to have one of the highest redox potentials, allowing degrading many refractory organic compounds. A reaction mechanism has been proposed for the formation of the hydroxyl radical at the anode through oxidation of water: S + H2O -> S[*OH] + H+ + e- Where S represents the generic surface site for adsorption on the electrode surface. Then, the radical species can interact with the contaminants through two different reaction mechanisms, according to the anode material. The surface of \\"active\\" anodes strongly interacts with hydroxyl radicals, leading to the production of higher state oxides or superoxides. The higher oxide then acts as a mediator in the selective oxidation of organic pollutants. Due to the radicals being strongly chemisorbed onto the electrode surface, the reactions are limited to the proximity of the anode surface, according to the mechanism: S[*OH] -> SO +H+ + e- SO + R -> S + RO Where R is the generic organic compound, while RO is the partially oxidized product. If the electrode interacts weakly with the radicals, it is qualified as a \\"non active\\" anode. Hydroxyl radicals are physisorbed on the electrode surface by means of weak interaction forces and thus available for reaction with contaminants. The organic pollutants are converted to fully oxidized products, such as CO2, and reactions occur in a much less selective way with respect to active anodes: S[*OH] + R -> S + mCO2 + nH2O + H+ + e- Both chemisorbed and physisorbed radicals can undergo the oxygen evolution competitive reaction. For this reason, the distinction between active and non active anodes is made according to their oxygen evolution overpotential. Electrodes with low oxygen overpotential show an active behavior, as in the case of Platinum, graphite or mixed metal oxides electrodes. Conversely, electrodes with high oxygen overpotential will be non active. Typical examples of non active electrodes are lead dioxide or boron-doped diamond electrodes. A higher oxygen overpotential imply a lower yield of the oxygen evolution reaction, thus raising the anodic process efficiency. = Mediated oxidation = When appropriate oxidizing agents are dissolved into the solution, the electro- oxidation process not only leads to organics oxidation at the electrode surface, but it also promotes the formation of other oxidant species within the solution. Such oxidizing chemicals are not bound to the anode surface and can extend the oxidation process to the entire bulk of the system. Chlorides are the most widespread species for the mediated oxidation. This is due to the chlorides being very common in most wastewater effluents and being easily converted into hypochlorite, according to global reaction: Cl- + H2O -> ClO- + 2H+ + 2e- Although hypochlorite is the main product, chlorine and hypochlorous acid are also formed as reactions intermediate. Such species are strongly reactive with many organic compounds, promoting their mineralization, but they can also produce several unwanted intermediates and final products. These chlorinated by-products sometimes can be even more harmful than the raw effluent contaminants and require additional treatments to be removed. To avoid this issue, sodium sulfate is preferred as electrolyte to sodium chloride, so that chloride ions are not available for the mediated oxidation reaction. Although sulfates can be involved in mediated oxidation as well, electrodes with high oxygen evolution overpotential are required to make it happen.  Electrode materials  = Carbon and graphite = Electrodes based on carbon or graphite are common due to their low cost and high surface area. Also, they are able to promote adsorption of contaminants on their surface while at the same generating the radicals for electro-oxidation. However, they are not suited for working at high potentials, as at such conditions they experience surface corrosion, resulting in reduced efficiency and progressive degradation of the exposed area. In fact, the overpotential for oxygen evolution is quite low for graphite (1.7 V vs SHE). = Platinum = Platinum electrodes provide good conductivity and they are inert and stable at high potentials. At the same time, the oxygen evolution overpotential is low (1.6 V vs SHE) and comparable to that of graphite. As a result, electro-oxidation with Platinum electrodes usually provides low yield due to partial oxidation of the compounds. The contaminants are converted into stable intermediates, difficult to be broken down, thus reducing current efficiency for complete mineralization. = Mixed metal oxides (MMOs) = Mixed metal oxides, also known as dimensionally stable anodes, are very popular in electrochemical process industry, because they are very effective in promoting both chlorine and oxygen evolution. In fact, they have been used extensively in the chloroalkali industry and for water electrolysis process. In the case of wastewater treatment, they provide low current efficiency, because they favor the competitive reaction of oxygen evolution. Similarly to Platinum electrodes, formation of stable intermediates is favored over complete mineralization of the contaminants, resulting in reduced removal efficiency. Due to their ability to promote chlorine evolution reaction, dimensionally stable anodes are the most common choice for processes relying on mediated oxidation mechanism, especially in the case of chlorine and hypochlorite production. = Lead dioxide = Lead dioxide electrodes have long been exploited in industrial applications, as they show high stability, large surface area, good conductivity and they are quite cheap. In addition, lead dioxide has a very high oxygen evolution overpotential (1.9 V vs SHE), which implies a high current efficiency for complete mineralization. Also, lead dioxide electrodes were found to be able to generate ozone, another strong oxidizer, at high potentials, according to the following mechanism: PbO2[*OH] -> PbO2[O*] + H+ + e- PbO2[O*] + O2-> PbO2 + O3 Also, the electrochemical properties and the stability of these electrodes can be improved by selecting the proper crystal structure: the highly crystalline beta-phase of lead dioxide showed improved performance in the removal of phenols, due to the increased active surface provided by its porous structure. Moreover, incorporation of metallic species, such as Fe, Bi or As, within the film was found to increase the current efficiency for mineralization. = Boron-doped diamond (BDD) = Synthetic diamond is doped with Boron to raise its conductivity, making it feasible as electrochemical electrode. Once doped, BDD electrodes show high chemical and electrochemical stability, good conductivity, great resistance to corrosion even in harsh environment and a remarkable wide potential window (2.3 V vs SHE). For this reason, BDD is generally considered as the most effective electrode for complete mineralization of organics, providing high current efficiency as well as lower energy consumption compared to all other electrodes. At the same time, the manufacturing processes for this electrode, usually based on high temperature CVD technologies, are very costly.  Reaction kinetics  Once the hydroxyl radicals are formed on the electrode surface, they rapidly react with organic pollutants, resulting in a lifetime of few nanoseconds. However, a transfer of ions from the bulk of the solution to the proximity of the electrode surface is required for the reaction to occur. Above a certain potential, the active species formed near the electrode are immediately consumed and the diffusion through the boundary layer near the electrode surface becomes the limiting step of the process. This explains why the observed rate of some fast electrode reactions can be low due to transport limitations. Evaluation of the limiting current density can be used as a tool to assess whether the electrochemical process is in diffusion control or not. If the mass transfer coefficient for the system is known, the limiting current density can be defined for a generic organic pollutant according to the relation: j_L=\\\\frac{Fk_dCOD}{8} Where jL is the limiting current density (A/m2), F is the Faraday's constant (96'485 C/mol), kd is the mass transfer coefficient (m/s), COD is the chemical oxygen demand for the organic pollutant (g/dm3) and 8 is the oxygen equivalent mass. According to this equation, the lower the COD the lower the corresponding limiting current. Hence, systems with low COD are likely to be operating in diffusion control, exhibiting pseudo-first order kinetics with exponential decrease. Conversely, for high COD concentration (roughly above 4000 mg/L) pollutants are degraded under kinetic control (actual current below the limiting value), following a linear trend according to zero-order kinetics. For intermediate values, the COD initially decreases linearly, under kinetic control, but below a critical COD value diffusion becomes the limiting step, resulting in an exponential trend. If the limiting current density is obtained with other analytical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry, the proposed equation can be used to retrieve the corresponding mass transfer coefficient for the investigated system.  Notable applications  Given the thorough investigations on the process design and electrodes formulation, electro-oxidation has already been applied to both pilot-scale and full-stage commercially available plants. Some relevant cases are listed below: # Oxineo and Sysneo are dedicated product for disinfection of public and private pools, where radicals are generated through electro-oxidation with BDD electrodes in order to destroy the microorganisms in the water. Compared to other disinfection methods, these systems do not require chemicals dosing, they do not produce any chlorine smell and they prevent algae formation and accumulation. # CONDIAS and Advanced Diamond Technologies Inc. supply equipment for anodic oxidation with BDD electrodes, sold with the trademark of CONDIACELL and Diamonox, which can be used either for water disinfection or for industrial effluents treatment. # A pilot plant was installed in 2007 in Cantabria (Spain), featuring an electro-oxidation with BDD electrodes as a final stage after aerobic remediation and chemical Fenton oxidation. The overall removal efficiency for organic pollutants was 99% for the combined processes.

Each network slice is an isolated end-to-end network tailored to fulfil diverse requirements requested by a particular application. For this reason, this technology assumes a central role to support 5G mobile networks that are designed to efficiently embrace a plethora of services with very different service level requirements (SLR). The realization of this service- oriented view of the network leverages on the concepts of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) that allow the implementation of flexible and scalable network slices on top of a common network infrastructure. From a business model perspective, each network slice is administrated by a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). The infrastructure provider (the owner of the telecommunication infrastructure) leases its physical resources to the MVNOs that share the underlying physical network. According to the availability of the assigned resources, a MVNO can autonomously deploy multiple network slices that are customized to the various applications provided to its own users. History The history of network slicing can be tracked back to the late 80s with the introduction of the concept of \\"slice\\" in the networking field. Overlay networks provided the first form of network slicing since heterogeneous network resources were combined together to create virtual networks over a common infrastructure. However, they lacked a mechanism that could enable their programmability. In the early 2000s, PlanetLab introduced a virtualization framework that allowed groups of users to program network functions in order to obtain isolated and application-specific slices. The advent of SDN technologies in 2009 further extended the programmability capabilities via open interfaces that enabled the realization of fully configurable and scalable network slices. In the context of mobile networks, network slicing evolved from the concept of RAN sharing that was initially introduced in LTE standard. Examples of such technology are multi-operator radio access networks (MORAN) and multi-operator core networks (MOCN), which allow network operators to share common LTE resources within the same radio access network (RAN). Key concepts The \\"one-size-fits-all\\" network paradigm employed in the past mobile networks (2G, 3G and 4G) is no longer suited to efficiently address a market model composed by very different applications like machine-type communication, ultra reliable low latency communication and enhanced mobile broadband content delivery. Network slicing emerges as an essential technique in 5G networks to accommodate such different and possibly contrasting quality of service (QoS) requirements exploiting a single physical network infrastructure. The basic idea of network slicing is to \\"slice\\" the original network architecture in multiple logical and independent networks that are configured to effectively meet the various services requirements. To quantitatively realize such concept, several techniques are employed: * Network functions: they express elementary network functionalities that are used as \\"building blocks\\" to create every network slice. * Virtualization: it provides an abstract representation of the physical resources under a unified and homogeneous scheme. In addition, it enables a scalable slice deployment relying on NFV that allows the decoupling of each network function instance from the network hardware it runs on. * Orchestration: it is a process that allows coordination of all the different network components that are involved in the life-cycle of each network slice. In this context, SDN is employed to enable a dynamic and flexible slice configuration. =Impact and applications= In commercial terms, network slicing allows a mobile operator to create specific virtual networks that cater to particular clients and use cases. Certain applications - such as mobile broadband, machine-to-machine communications (e.g. in manufacturing or logistics), or smart cars - will benefit from leveraging different aspects of 5G technology. One might require higher speeds, another low latency, and yet another access to edge computing resources. By creating separate slices that prioritise specific resources a 5G operator can offer tailored solutions to particular industries. Some sources insist this will revolutionise industries like marketing, augmented reality, or mobile gaming, while others are more cautious, pointing to unevenness in network coverage and poor reach of advantages beyond increased speed. Slicing can also enhance service continuity via improved roaming across networks, by creating a virtual network running on physical infrastructure that spans multiple local or national networks; or by allowing a host network to create an optimised virtual network which replicates the one offered by a roaming device's home network. Architecture overview Generic 5G network slicing framework Although there are different proposal of network slice architectures, it is possible to define a general architecture that maps the common elements of each solution into a general and unified framework. From a high-level perspective, the network slicing architecture can be considered as composed by two mains blocks, one dedicated to the actual slice implementation and the other dedicated to the slice management and configuration. The first block is designed as a multi-tier architecture composed by three layers (service layer, network function layer, infrastructure layer), where each one contributes to the slice definition and deployment with distinct tasks. The second block is designed as a centralized network entity, generically denoted as network slice controller, that monitors and manages the functionalities between the three layers in order to efficiently coordinate the coexistence of multiple slices. =Service layer= The service layer interfaces directly with the network business entities (e.g. MVNOs and 3rd party service providers) that share the underlying physical network and it provides a unified vision of the service requirements. Each service is formally represented as service instance, which embeds all the network characteristics in the form of SLA requirements that are expected to be fully satisfied by a suitable slice creation. =Network function layer= The network function layer is in charge of the creation of each network slice according to service instance requests coming from the upper layer. It is composed by a set of network functions that embody well-defined behaviors and interfaces. Multiple network functions are placed over the virtual network infrastructure and chained together to create an end-to-end network slice instance that reflects the network characteristics requested by the service. The configuration of the network functions are performed by means of a set of network operations that allow management of their full life-cycle (from their placement when a slice is created to their de-allocation when the function provided is no longer needed). To increase resource usage efficiency, the same network function can be simultaneously shared by different slices at the cost of an increase in the complexity of operations management. Conversely, a one- to-one mapping between each network function and each slice eases the configuration procedures, but can lead to poor and inefficient resource usage. =Infrastructure layer= The infrastructure layer represents the actual physical network topology (radio access network, transport network and core network) upon which every network slice is multiplexed and it provides the physical network resources to host the several network functions composing each slice. The network domain of the available resources includes a heterogeneous set of infrastructure components like data centers (storage and computation capacity resources), devices enabling network connectivity such as routers (networking resources) and base stations (radio bandwidth resources). =Network slice controller= The network slice controller is defined as a network orchestrator, which interfaces with the various functionalities performed by each layer to coherently manage each slice request. The benefit of such network element is that it enables an efficient and flexible slice creation that can be reconfigured during its life-cycle. Operationally, the network slice controller is in charge of several tasks that provide a more effective coordination between the aforementioned layers: *End-to-end service management: mapping of the various service instances expressed in terms of SLA requirements with suitable network functions capable of satisfying the service constraints. *Virtual resources definition: virtualization of the physical network resources in order to simplify the resources management operations performed to allocate network functions. *Slice life-cycle management: slice performance monitoring across all the three layers in order to dynamically reconfigure each slice to accommodate possible SLA requirements modifications. Due to the complexity of the performed tasks which address different purposes, the network slice controller can be composed by multiple orchestrators that independently manage a subset of functionalities of each layer. To fulfill the service requirements, the various orchestration entities need to coordinate with each other by exchanging high-level information about the state of the operations involved in the slice creation and deployment. Slice isolation Slice isolation is an important requirement that allows enforcing the core concept of network slicing about the simultaneous coexistence of multiple slices sharing the same infrastructure. This property is achieved by imposing that each slice performance must not have any impact on the other slice's performance. The benefit of this design choice is that enhances the network slice architecture in two main aspects: * Slice security: cyber-attacks or faults occurrences affect only the target slice and have limited impact on the life-cycle of other existing slices. * Slice privacy: private information related to each slice (e.g. user statistics, MVNO business model) are not shared among other slices.

It is required that structures are designed to preserve their characteristics during the service life, avoiding premature failure and the need of extraordinary maintenance and restoration works. Considerable efforts have therefore made in the last decades in order to define useful models describing the degradation processes affecting reinforced concrete structures, to be used during the design stage in order to assess the material characteristics and the structural layout of the structure.. Service life of a reinforced concrete structure Initiation and propagation periods of steel rebar corrosion in a reinforced concrete structure Initially, the chemical reactions that normally occur in the cement paste, generate an alkaline environment, bringing the solution in the cement paste pores to pH values around 13. In these conditions, passivation of steel rebar occurs, due to a spontaneous generation of a thin film of oxides able to protect the steel from corrosion. Over time, the thin film can be damaged, and corrosion of steel rebar starts. The corrosion of steel rebar is one of the main causes of premature failure of reinforced concrete structures worldwide, mainly as a consequence of two degradation processes, carbonation and penetration of chlorides. With regard to the corrosion degradation process, a simple and accredited model for the assessment of the service life is the one proposed by Tuutti, in 1982. According to this model, the service life of a reinforced concrete structure can be divided into two distinct phases. * t_{i}, initiation time: from the moment the structure is built, to the moment corrosion initiates on steel rebar. More in particular, it is the time required for aggressive agents (carbon dioxide and chlorides) to penetrate the concrete cover thickness, reach the embedded steel rebar, alter the initial passivation condition on steel surface and cause corrosion initiation. * t_{p}, propagation time: which is defined as the time from the onset of active corrosion until an ultimate limit state is reached, i.e. corrosion propagation reaches a limit value corresponding to unacceptable structural damage, such as cracking and detachment of the concrete cover thickness. The identification of initiation time and propagation time is useful to further identify the main variables and processes influencing the service life of the structure which are specific of each service life phase and of the degradation process considered. =Carbonation-induced corrosion= The initiation time is related to the rate at which carbonation propagates in the concrete cover thickness. Once that carbonation reaches the steel surface, altering the local pH value of the environment, the protective thin film of oxides on the steel surface becomes instable, and corrosion initiates involving an extended portion of the steel surface. One of the most simplified and accredited models describing the propagation of carbonation in time is to consider penetration depth proportional to the square root of time, following the correlation x=K \\\\sqrt{t} where x is the carbonation depth, t is time, and K is the carbonation coefficient. The corrosion onset takes place when the carbonation depth reaches the concrete cover thickness, and therefore can be evaluated as t_{i}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{c}{K} \\\\right)^2 where c is the concrete cover thickness. K is the key design parameter to assess initiation time in the case of carbonation-induced corrosion. It is expressed in mm/year1/2 and depends on the characteristics of concrete and the exposure conditions. The penetration of gaseous CO2 in a porous medium such as concrete occurs via diffusion. The humidity content of concrete is one of the main influencing factors of CO2 diffusion in concrete. If concrete pores are completely and permanently saturated (for instance in submerged structures) CO2 diffusion is prevented. On the other hand, for completely dry concrete, the chemical reaction of carbonation cannot occur. Another influencing factor for CO2 diffusion rate is concrete porosity. Concrete obtained with higher w/c ratio or obtained with an incorrect curing process presents higher porosity at hardened state, and is therefore subjected to a higher carbonation rate. The influencing factors concerning the exposure conditions are the environmental temperature, humidity and concentration of CO2. Carbonation rate is higher for environments with higher humidity and temperature, and increases in polluted environments such as urban centres and inside close spaces as tunnels. To evaluate propagation time in the case of carbonation-induced corrosion, several models have been proposed. In a simplified but commonly accepted method, the propagation time is evaluated as function of the corrosion propagation rate. If the corrosion rate is considered constant, tp can be estimated as: t_{p}= \\\\frac{p_{lim}}{v_{corr}} where p_{lim} is the limit corrosion penetration in steel and v_{corr} is the corrosion propagation rate. p_{lim} must be defined in function of the limit state considered. Generally for carbonation-induced corrosion the concrete cover cracking is considered as limit state, and in this case a p_{lim} equal to 100 Œºm is considered. v_{corr} depends on the environmental factors in proximity of the corrosion process, such as the availability of oxygen and water at concrete cover depth. Oxygen is generally available at the steel surface, except for submerged structures. If pores are costantly fully saturated, a very low amount of oxygen reaches the steel surface and corrosion rate can be considered negligible. For very dry concretes v_{corr} is negligible due to the absence of water which prevents the chemical reaction of corrosion. For intermediate concrete humidity content, corrosion rate increases with increasing the concrete humidity content. Since the humidity content in a concrete can significantly vary along the year, it is general not possible to define a constant v_{corr}. One possible approach is to consider a mean annual value of v_{corr}. =Chloride- induced corrosion= The presence of chlorides to the steel surface, above a certain critical amount, can locally break the protective thin film of oxides on the steel surface, even if concrete is still alkaline, causing a very localized and aggressive form of corrosion known as pitting. Current regulations forbid the use of chloride contaminated raw materials, therefore one factor influencing the initiation time is chloride penetration rate from the environment. This is a complex task, because chloride solutions penetrate in concrete through the combination of several transport phenomena, such as diffusion, capillary effect and hydrostatic pressure. Chloride binding is another phenomenon affecting the kinetic of chloride penetration. Part of the total chloride ions can be absorbed or can chemically react with some constituents of the cement paste, leading to a reduction of chlorides in the pore solution (free chlorides that are steel able to penetrate in concrete). The ability of a concrete to chloride binding is related to the cement type, being higher for blended cements containing silica fume, fly ash or furnace slag. Being the modelling of chloride penetration in concrete particularly complex, a simplified correlation is generally adopted, which was firstly proposed by Collepardi in 1972 C(x,t)=C_{s}\\\\left[1- \\\\mathrm{erf} \\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{2\\\\sqrt{Dt}}\\\\right) \\\\right] Where C_{s} is the chloride concentration at the exposed surface, x is the chloride penetration depth, D is the chloride diffusion coefficient, and t is time. This equation is a solution of Fick's II law of diffusion in the hypothesis that chloride initial content is zero, that C_{s} is constant in time on the whole surface, and D is constant in time and through the concrete cover. With C_{s} and D known, the equation can be used to evaluate the temporal evolution of the chloride concentration profile in the concrete cover and evaluate the initiation time as the moment in which critical chloride threshold (C_{cl}) is reached at the depth of steel rebar. However, there are many critical issues related to the practical use of this model. For existing reinforced concrete structures in chloride-bearing environment C_{s} and D can be identified calculating the best-fit curve for measured chloride concertation profiles. From concrete samples retrieved on field is therefore possible to define the values of Cs and D for residual service life evaluation. On the other hand, for new structures it is more complicated to define C_{s} and D. These parameters depend on the exposure conditions, the properties of concrete such as porosity (and therefore w/c ratio and curing process) and type of cement used. Furthermore, for the evaluation of long-term behaviour of structure, a critical issue is related to the fact that C_{s} and D can not be considered constant in time, and that the transport penetration of chlorides can be considered as pure diffusion only for submerged structures. A further issue is the assessment of C_{cl}. There are various influencing factors, such as are the potential of steel rebar and the pH of the solution included in concrete pores. Moreover, pitting corrosion initiation is a phenomenon with a stochastic nature, therefore also C_{cl} can be defined only on statistical basis. Corrosion prevention The durability assessment has been implemented in European design codes at the beginning of the 90s. It is required for designers to include the effects of long-term corrosion of steel rebar during the design stage, in order to avoid unacceptable damages during the service life of the structure. Different approaches are then available for the durability design. =Standard approach= It is the standardized method to deal with durability, also known as deem-to-satisfy approach, and provided by current european regulation EN 206. It is required that the designer identifies the environmental exposure conditions and the expected degradation process, assessing the correct exposure class. Once this is defined, design code gives standard prescriptions for w/c ratio, the cement content, and the thickness of the concrete cover. This approach represents an improvement step for the durability design of reinforced concrete structures, it is suitable for the design of ordinary structures designed with traditional materials (Portland cement, carbon steel rebar) and with an expected service life of 50 years. Nevertheless, it is considered not completely exhaustive in some cases. The simple prescriptions do not allow to optimize the design for different parts of the structures with different local exposure conditions. Furthermore, they do not allow to consider the effects on service life of special measures such as the use of additional protections. =Performance-based approach= Figure 2 - Failure probability and target service life in performance-based service life models for reinforced concrete structures Performance-based approaches provide for a real design of durability, based on models describing the evolution in time of degradation processes, and the definition of times at which defined limit states will be reached. To consider the wide variety of service life influencing factors and their variability, performance-based approaches address the problem from a probabilistic or semiprobabilistic point of view. The performance-based service life model proposed by the European project DuraCrete, and by FIB Model Code for Service Life Design , is based on a probabilistic approach, similar to the one adopted for structural design. Environmental factors are considered as loads S(t), while material properties such as chloride penetration resistance are considered as resistances R(t) as shown in Figure 2. For each degradation process, design equations are set to evaluate the probability of failure of predefined performances of the structure, where acceptable probability is selected on the basis of the limit state considered. The degradation processes are still described with the models previously defined for carbonation-induced and chloride-induced corrosion, but to reflect the statistical nature of the problem, the variables are considered as probability distribution curves over time . To assess some of the durability design parameters, the use of accelerated laboratory test is suggested, such as the so called Rapid Chloride Migration Test to evaluate chloride penetration resistance of concrete '. Through the application of corrective parameters, the long-term behaviour of the structure in real exposure conditions may be evaluated. The use of probabilistic service life models allows to implement a real durability design that could be implemented in the design stage of structures. This approach is of particular interest when an extended service life is required (>50 years) or when the environmental exposure conditions are particularly aggressive. Anyway, the applicability of this kind of models is still limited. The main critical issues still concern, for instance, the individuation of accelerated laboratory tests able to characterize concrete performances, reliable corrective factors to be used for the evaluation of long-term durability performances and the validation of these models based on real long-term durability performances.

In this way, the laser becomes sensitive to the distance traveled by the reflected beam thus becoming a distance, speed or vibration sensor. The advantage compared to a traditional measurement system is a lower cost thanks to the absence of collimation optics and external photodiodes. Background After the development of the classic external interferometric configurations (Michelson and Mach-Zehnder interferometers) which consisted of lenses, beam splitter, mirrors, and corner cube, the possibility of creating a much simpler and more compact system was investigated. Starting in the 1980s, this new configuration known as retro- injection or self-mixing was explored and applications based on the retro- injection effect in commercial laser diodes appeared in the scientific literature. Typical interferometric fringing signalIn this type of interferometric configuration the fact is exploited that a small fraction of the light emitted by a laser, after having been reflected by a vibrating target, is re-injected into the laser cavity, where a sort of coherent radiation detection is realized: the power emitted by the laser is in fact modulated both in amplitude (AM) and in frequency (FM), generating a fringes interferometric signal. This signal is a periodic function of the phase \\\\Phi of the back-scattered field, according to the following relation: \\\\Phi= 2ks_{0} = 2\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}s_{0} where k is the wave number and s_{0} is the physical distance between the laser source and the moving target. If a phase shift of an entire period is imposed, that is \\\\Delta\\\\Phi=2\\\\pi, we get \\\\Delta\\\\text{s}=\\\\tfrac{\\\\lambda}{2}. So, if we can see an entire fringe on the oscilloscope screen, we can say that the phase shift due to the movement of the obstacle is 2\\\\pi, that is \\\\lambda/2. In this way, by counting the number of visible fringes, it is possible to calculate both the magnitude and the direction of the displacement with a resolution of \\\\lambda/2. Compared to the classic interferometers that refer to Michelson one, this new type of interferometer is considerably simpler, since the laser beam already has all the information related to the signal that is no longer generated by the beating of two beams coming from optical path difference. Therefore, the reference optical path is no longer necessary for measurement and relies only on the interaction between the electric field that travels to the target and the electric field inside the laser cavity. AM self-mixing laser interferometry Self-mixing configuration in amplitude modulation (AM) Interferometric fringes The trend of the amplitude modulated interferometric signal is shown, generated by a vibrating target (such as an audio speaker) powered through a sinusoidal voltage. For the properties of self-mixing laser interferometry, whenever the vibration of a vibrating target is such that its displacement is greater than or equal to \\\\lambda_{0}/2 (where \\\\lambda_{0} is wavelength of employed laser), an interferometric fringe is created. However, with regard to amplitude modulation of the interferometric signal there are basically two consequences: *through the simple counting of the number of fringes generated, it is possible to retrieve the displacement of the target *instruments that use only the amplitude modulation (AM) are not very sensitive The amplitude modulation (AM) of the emitted optical power is detected by the photodiode of monitor (PD) inside the laser package. In this particular interferometric technique the resolution of the displacement and vibration measurement is limited by a low signal-to-noise radio or SNR, such that the system is only suitable for slow and wide measurements . FM self- mixing laser interferometry Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Mach-Zehnder transfer function Compared to the reading of the amplitude modulation performed with a photodiode, the reading of the frequency modulation is more complex, since the signal is superimposed on a carrier at the optical frequencies (of the order of THz) invisible to the semiconductor detectors and to the reading electronics, so that techniques (such as a superheterodyne receiver) or complex optical systems to convert frequency modulation into an amplitude modulation would be necessary: in fact by exploiting frequency modulation it would be theoretically possible achieving a higher signal-to- noise ratio and hence a better resolution in the condition of shifts less than half the wavelength. A system capable of converting the frequency modulation into the amplitude one is formed by a Mach-Zehnder interferometer which acts as an optical filter. The shape of the filter transfer function has a perfectly sinusoidal pattern by changing the frequency of the laser; the sinusoidal profile is repeated for the whole spectrum, due to the interference phenomenon on which the operation of the filter is based: *Filter transfer function: T(v)\\\\cong\\\\mathbf{\\\\Gamma_{AM}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{sin}\\\\left[\\\\frac{2\\\\pi n_{\\\\text{g}}\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!L}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right] where, \\\\Gamma_{AM} is an amplitude coefficient and n_{\\\\text{g}} is the group index. It is possible to carry out the conversion appropriately by calibrating the path difference \\\\Delta\\\\text{L} at any optical frequency (therefore to any laser wavelength). The path difference \\\\Delta\\\\text{L} determines both the Free Spectral Range (FSR) of the instrument, coinciding with the bandwidth between two consecutive peaks of the transfer function, and the filter sensitivity. In particular, if the length of the Mach-Zehnder's path difference is large, then the sensitivity of the filter will be high, so that the converted signal amplitude is increased; while, if the length of the Mach-Zehnder's path difference is small, then the sensitivity of the filter will be low, so that the converted signal amplitude is reduced: *Filter sensitivity: \\\\left.\\\\frac{T(v)}{dv}\\\\right_{max}\\\\cong\\\\frac{2\\\\pi n_{\\\\text{g}}\\\\Delta\\\\\\\\!L}{c} In order to design the Mach-Zehnder \\\\Delta\\\\text{L}, it is needed achieving a compromise between sensitivity, FSR and dimensions of the filter, taking into account the main sources of noise in the system. Noise sources The noise sources that affect the entire system are related to both amplitude and frequency modulation. In particular, the noise sources related to the AM modulation are due both to the dark current noise, to the shot noise and to the electronics of the monitor photodiode, and to the laser shot noise. Similarly, the noise sources related to FM modulation are due not only to the dark current noise, to the shot noise and to that of the FM photodiode electronics, but also to the contribution of noise related to the laser frequency modulation, which is converted into amplitude noise by the Mach- Zehnder interferometer: this latter type of noise is related to the line width of the laser, which is in turn linked to the random phase of the photons emitted by spontaneous emission. Compatibly with the noise associated with the electronics of the instrument that will be used for the acquisition of AM and FM signals, it will be possible to reduce the path difference and therefore the noise associated with the interferometric signal, as long as the contribution of dominant noise remains that relative to frequency modulation.

The Date of Filarete‚Ä≤s Treatise  Filarete's book was dedicated to Francesco Sforza, and he called his own book as the \\"Libro Architecttonico\\". The book contains 25 parts. Most of the parts were finished during his stays in Milan. After his last stay in Milan, he turned to Florence, and during his travel, he wrote the last part of his book (Filarete‚Ä≤s term used for the chapters or parts of his books is \\"libro\\"). The book would be expected to be dedicate to the Medici family, and later he added another dedicatory to Piero de Medici. By the research of Vasari, has been de terminated that the last two additions of \\"Libro Architecttonico\\" were finished during 1464, and the scholars of his contemporary time, have defined this information as correct. For the previous 24 books, Spencer(add cite) proposed the years between: 1461 and 1462 for the first 21 books, and 1460 (year?) for the books on drawings (book 22-24) and the last one book for Medici. While Grassi Liliana, thought the books would be finished during 1460 and 1461, and he also thought the revision would be later around 1464 (not clear).  The Book Framework of Filarete‚Äôs Treatise  The books of Filarete were named for long time as \\"manuscripts\\", the books contains two groups of contents. The first group contains two parts, the first part was dedicated to Francesco Sforza and the second was to Piero De Medici.

This group was written for Mattia Corvino, and it was strongly influenced by the book of Vitruvius. Filarete‚Ä≤s books has a narrative structure. In the books, he imagines that Francesco Sforza need him to plan a new city, called Sforzainda. Filarete is in charge of this work and he found the \\"Golden Book\\" a mythical book about the city of \\"Plugiapolis\\" written by the ancient king, Zogalia. The \\"Golden book\\" gave him the idea of the new city. The central part of the Filarete‚Ä≤s books describe the city and the buildings inside of it.

Founded in 1896 by Eugen Diederichs, it profoundly shaped intellectual life at the beginning of the 20th century. After three generations as a family-owned enterprise, from 1988 the firm was owned by Hugendubel. Since 2008, it has been part of the Verlagsgruppe Random House.  History  A bookseller by trade, Eugen Diederichs (1867‚Äì1930) made a trip to Italy after the death of his father. The travel journals published in his home town of Naumburg (Saale) formed the basis of his publishing activities. In 1896, Diederichs founded his book publishing house. Initially based in Florence, Diederichs later moved with his publishing house to Leipzig, finally locating in Jena in 1904. Through Diederichs' achievements, the university town of Jena in Thuringia developed into a significant locations in Germany for publishing. The range included Classical and Romantic literary works, along with non-fiction publications. In addition to books such as those from Hans Christian Andersen, Henri Bergson, Maxim Gorky, S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Leo N. Tolstoy and Anton Chekhov, several book series were published, such as \\"Monographien zur deutschen Kulturgeschichte\\" (Monographs on German Cultural History). Of special significance alongside the \\"Sammlung Thule\\" () were \\"M√§rchen der Weltliteratur\\" (), the entire bibliography of which today encompasses 174 editions. In the 1930s, Diederichs' sons, Niels and Peter, managed the publishing house. During the Nazi period , they adapted the portfolio to the intellectual guidelines of the regime. After the Second World War, the two men resumed operations in D√ºsseldorf and Cologne. From 1973 to 1988, the publishing house was headed up by Diederichs' grandson, Ulf. Due to economic difficulties, it was ultimately sold to Heinrich Hugendubel. Hugendubel sought to position the publisher \\"between tradition and innovation.\\" In 1999, Diederichs became a brand within the Hugendubel publishing company and, as part of that group, was sold to business lawyer Monika Roell. In 2008, the Verlagsgruppe Random House announced the takeover of the brands belonging to the Hugendubel publishing house, including Diederichs. The archive of the publisher and of the family came under the auspices of the . While \\"world cultures, fairy tales of world literature and world religions\\" were the publisher's main focus, the profile of Diederichs underwent myriad changes in the years that followed, and the range was gradually revamped.  Portfolio  Today, Diederichs publishes biographies, novels, memoirs, modern fairy tales and poetry. Recent authors include Igal Avidan, Eva Padberg, and Botho Strauss. The current list of publications encompasses 90 books, including e-books under the \\"Diederichs Digital\\" label. Diederichs has also published a select number of audio books. Among the new releases are the licensed new edition of \\"Eine Stunde hinter Mitternacht\\" () by Hermann Hesse, first published in 1899 by Diederichs, and the German version of the fable, \\"The Dog, the Wolf and God\\" by Folco Terzani.

History  Honda cars have been sold in Indonesia since 1968 through Prospect's affiliated sales company, PT Imora Motor. In 1975, Prospect began local consignment production of Honda automobiles, responding to Indonesian government policy to encourage local automobile production. Honda vehicle sales in 1997 totaled 6,872 units (up 7% over 1996) but declined by 83% in 1998, to 1,182 units, mainly due to the economic crisis that hit the Southeast Asian region.

The term electronic refers to the fact that the optical frequencies in the visible spectral range are used to excite electronic energy states of the system; however such a technique is also used in the IR optical range (excitation of vibrational states) and in this case the method is called two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2DIR). This technique records the signal which is emitted from a system after an interaction with a sequence of 3 laser pulses. Such pulses usually have a time duration of few hundred femtosecond (10‚àí15 s) and this high time resolution allows capturing of dynamics inside the system that evolves with the same time scale. The main result of this technique is a two-dimensional absorption spectrum that shows the correlation between excitation and detection frequencies. Basic concepts about 2DES =Pulse sequence= The pulse sequence in this experiment is the same as 2DIR in which the delay between the first and second pulse is called the coherence time and is usually labeled as t_1. The delay between the second and the third pulse is called the population time and it is labeled as t_2. The time after the third pulse corresponds to the detection time t_3 which is usually Fourier transformed by a spectrometer. The interaction with the pulses creates a third-order nonlinear response function S(t_1,t_2,t_3) of the system from which it is possible to extract two-dimensional spectra as a function of excitation and detection frequencies. =2D Signal= A possible way to recover an analytical expression of the response function is to consider the system as an ensemble and deal with the light-matter interaction process by using the density matrix approach. Such a result shows that the response function is proportional to the product of the three pulses' electric fields. Considering \\\\vec{k_1},\\\\vec{k_2},\\\\vec{k_3} the wave vectors of the three pulses, the nonlinear signal will emit in several directions \\\\vec{k_s} which are derived from a linear combination of the three wave vectors: \\\\vec{k_s}=\\\\pm \\\\vec{k_1}\\\\pm \\\\vec{k_2}\\\\pm \\\\vec{k_3}. For this technique, two different signals which propagate in different directions are usually taken into account. When \\\\vec{k_s}=-\\\\vec{k_1}+\\\\vec{k_2}+\\\\vec{k_3} the signal is called rephasing and when \\\\vec{k_s}=\\\\vec{k_1}-\\\\vec{k_2}+\\\\vec{k_3} the signal is called non-rephasing. An interpretation of these signals is possible by considering the system to be composed of many electric dipoles. When the first pulse interacts with the system, the dipoles start to oscillate in phase. The signal generates from each dipole rapidly dephases due to the different interaction that each dipole experienced with the environment. The interaction with the third pulse, in the case of rephasing, generates a signal which has an opposite temporal evolution with respect to the previous one. The dephasing of the last signal during t_3 compensates the one during t_1. When t_3=t_1 the oscillations are in-phase again and the new signal generated is called photon echo. In the other case, there is no creation of a photon echo and the signal is called non-rephasing. From these signals is possible to extract the pure absorptive and dispersive spectra which are usually shown in literature. The real part of the sum of these two signals represents the absorption of the system and the imaginary part contains the dispersion contribution. In the absorptive 2D spectra, the sign of the peak implies different effects. If the transmitted signal is plotted, a positive peak can be associated to a bleaching signal with respect to the ground state or stimulated emission. If the sign is negative, that peak on the 2D spectra is associated with a photoinduced absorption. =Acquisition of the 2DES spectra= The first and the second pulses act as a pump and the third as a probe. The time-domain nonlinear response of the system interferes with another pulse called local oscillator (LO) which allows measurement of both amplitude and phase. Such a signal is usually acquired with a spectrometer which separates the contribution of each spectral components (detection frequencies u_3). The acquisition proceeds by scanning the delay t_1 for a fixed delay t_2. Once the scan ends, the detector has acquired a signal as a function of coherence time per each detection frequency S(t_1,t_2, u_3). The application of the Fourier transform along the t_1 axis allows for recovery of the excitation spectra for every u_3. The result of this procedure is a 2D map that shows the correlation between excitation ( u_1) and detection frequency ( u_3) at a fixed population time S( u_1,t_2, u_3). The time evolution of the system can be measured by repeating the procedure described before for different values of t_2. There are several methods to implement this technique, all of which are based on the different configurations of the pulses. Two examples of possible implementations are the \\"boxcar geometry\\" and the \\"partially collinear geometry\\". The boxcar geometry is a configuration where all the pulses arrive at the system from different directions \\\\vec{k_1} eq\\\\vec{k_2} eq\\\\vec{k_3} this property allows acquiring separately the rephasing and non-rephasing signal. The partially collinear geometry is another implementation of this technique where the first and the second pulse coming from the same direction \\\\vec{k_1}=\\\\vec{k_2} eq\\\\vec{k_3}. In this case, the rephasing and non-rephasing signal are emitted in the same direction and it is possible to directly recover the absorptive and dispersive spectra of the system. Example of 2D spectra for 3 energy levels system (scheme on the right). Information acquired from 2DES 2D spectra contain a lot of information about the system; in particular amplitude, position and lineshape of the peaks are related to different effects that happened inside of the system. =Position of the peaks= Diagonal Peaks The peaks that stay along the diagonal line in the 2D spectra are called diagonal peaks. These peaks appear when the system emits a signal that oscillates at the same frequency of the excitation signal. These points reflect the information of the linear absorption spectrum. Cross Peaks The peaks that stay out of the diagonal line are called cross peaks. These peaks appear when the system emits a signal that oscillates at a different frequency with respect to the signal used to excite. When a cross peak appears means that two electronic states of the system are coupled because when the pulses pump an electronic state, the system responds with emission from a different energy level. This coupling can be related to an energy transfer or charge transfer process between molecules. =Lineshape of the peaks= Lineshape Evolution: a)Example of the lineshape at population time close to zero b) Example of the line shape at large population time Short population times Thanks to the high spectral resolution, this technique acquires information based on the two dimensional shape of the peaks. When t_2 is close to zero the diagonal peaks show an elliptical lineshape as is shown in the figure on the right. The width along the diagonal line represents the inhomogeneous broadening which contains information about interactions between the environment and the system. If the system is composed of a large amount of identical molecules, each of them interacts with the environment in a different way; this implies that the same electronic state of each molecule assumes different small variations. The value of the linewidth will be close to the one calculated in the linear absorption spectrum. On the other hand, the linewidth along the off-diagonal shows a smaller value with respect to the diagonal one. In this case the spectral broadening contains a contribution from a local interaction inside of the system; for this reason, the width reflects the homogeneous broadening. Long population times For t_2>>0fs, the shape of the peaks becomes circular and the width along diagonal and off-diagonal line are similar. This phenomena takes place because all the molecules of the system experienced different local environments and the entire system lose memory of the initial condition. This effect is called Spectral Diffusion. Temporal lineshape evolution a) Example of a peak on 2D spectra where a and b are the linewidth along diagonal and off diagonal line. b) Example of an application of CLS method The temporal evolution of the lineshape can be evaluated with several methods. One method evaluates the linewidth along diagonal and off- diagonal line separately. From the two values of the widths it is possible to calculate the flattening as f=\\\\frac{a-b}{a} where a is the linewidth along diagonal line and b is the linewidth along off-diagonal line. The flattening curve as a function of t_2 assumes a value close to 1 at t_2=0fs ( a>>b) and then decreases to zero at t_2>>0fs (a\\\\simeq b). Another method is called Central Line Slope (CLS). In this case the positions of the maximum values in the 2D spectra per each detection frequency are considered. These points are then interpolated with a linear function where is possible to extract the slope \\\\theta between this function and the detection axis (x axis). From a theoretical point of view, this value should be 45¬∞ when t_2 is close to zero because the peak is elongated along the diagonal line. When the peak assumes a circular lineshape, the value of the slope goes to zero. The same approach can also be used by considering the positions of the maximum values per each excitation frequency (y axis) and the slope will be 45¬∞ at t_2=0fs and 90¬∞ when the shape becomes circular.

Although synthetic, it is related structurally to natural alkaloid sparteine. It is a white crystalline solid. It has been widely investigated as a chelating agent. Many derivatives are known. Structure and stereochemistry Bispidine has a bicyclic scaffold consisting of two condensed piperidines. The unsubstituted bispidine backbone can assume three conformations: a chair-chair, boat-chair, and a boat-boat. In the gas phase, the chair-chair conformation predominates Synthesis A convenient route to synthesize the bispidine molecule involves a pent-1-en-3-one and a prop-2-en-1-amine leading to a bis(carbethoxyethyl)allylamine which converts in 1-allylpiperidin-4-one by acid hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Then a Mannich reaction occurs, in particular a condensation of a 4-piperidone derivative with paraformaldehyde and allylamine in presence of acetic acid forms N,N‚Äô-diallylbispidin-9-one. This latter, results in the final bispidine after treatment with ethyl chloroformate in the presence of NaI, followed by alkaline hydrolysis. thumb Reactions The reaction with formaldehyde gives the diazaadamantane. 500x500px Bispidine Ligands The bispidine unit can be chemically functionalized in several positions of its rigid bicyclic scaffold leading to a large number of bispidine-type ligands. =Synthesis= The first bispidine- based ligands dates back to 1930, when Carl Mannich reported the synthesis of two different substituted bispidine molecules. The common route to afford the bispidine derivatives is a variation of the Mannich reaction, in particular two steps are required to afford the final product. The first step includes a reaction between a compound containing acidic C-H hydrogens, an aldehyde and a primary amine, using a predefined molar ratio of 1:2:1, respectively, leading to a piperidone. Additionally, a second condensation between the piperidone, an aliphatic aldehyde and a primary amine, using a ratio of 1:4:2, yields the desired bispidine. The reaction conditions need to be controlled to avoid the competitive aldol reaction. Indeed the reaction solution should be as concentrated as possible to afford maximum yield, using alcohols, THF or other solvents listed in literature. Whereas high temperatures are preferred for one-step condensations, the two-step reaction is generally carried out at 0 ¬∞C for the first and refluxed during the second one. 1000x1000px =Stereochemistry= Chemical substitutions on the bispidine backbone can influence the equilibrium of conformers. Many computational studies and others based on nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C NMR), X-ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy have been done to investigate the different conformational entities of bispidine derivatives. =Coordination Chemistry= Bispidine-based ligands have been mostly employed in coordination chemistry. The first transition metal complex with bidentate bispidine dates back to 1957. Indeed, by the addition of further metal binding sites in the basic bispidine scaffold, that has already two aliphatic aminic N donor atoms, efficient stable metal complexes can be selectively synthesized, thus obtaining tetra-, penta-, hexa- and octa- dentate species. Potential applications Because of the chemical versatility of the bispidine scaffold and due to the metal selectivity and complexes stability of these type of ligand, they have been proposed for many applications, although none have been commercialized =Catalysis= Cu(II)-bispidine complexes catalyze aziridations. Amino acids-modified bispidine framework support catalysts for the enantio-selective aldol reaction of functionalized ketones. Bispidine- based iron complexes have been investigated for the oxidation of olefin and unactivated C-H bonds. =Pharmaceutical use= Several patents relate to the use of bispidine ligands for their antiarrhythmic and analgesic activity. It has been also found out that they exhibit high affinity and selectivity to ƒ∏-opioid receptors and many studies concerning the influence of structural variation towards their biological activity were also reported. =Medicine= Bispidine systems were also employed as bifunctional chelators for PET exams. Fast complexation, availability of different functionalities for the linking to the targeting vectors, and a cost-effective way to synthesize them in the multigram scale are among these requirements. The functionalization and optimization of pentadentate bispidine derivatives and the evaluation of the potential of radiocopper‚àíbispidine complexes as PET tracers have been done. =Other= Bispidine derivatives have been used as ligands to build novel one-dimensional coordination polymers, showing an interesting influence on the dynamic behaviour of these hybrid systems.

During this operation on 16 March 1968 the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment carried out the My Lai Massacre. Background Operation Muscatine was a security mission to protect Chu Lai and the neighboring lowlands from several Viet Cong (VC) battalions, and to search for their camps in the hills that ran along the Qu·∫£ng T√≠n‚ÄìQu·∫£ng Ng√£i border. Operation The 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division joined with the 196th Infantry Brigade to conduct the operation. The 196th Infantry Brigade moved north into the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley to join Operation Wheeler and was replaced by the 198th Infantry Brigade, which in turn handed over the operation to the newly arrived 11th Infantry Brigade. By January 1968 the 198th Infantry Brigade continued the operation in ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï District with the 1st Battalion, 52nd Infantry Regiment, and elements of the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. US soldiers suffered a steady stream of casualties from VC booby traps and mines, but rarely encountered the VC. Most of the mines came from bases abandoned by the South Korean 2nd Marine Brigade who had departed the area without clearing their minefields. On 17 January, Company A, 1/52nd Infantry, caught up with four VC local force companies near the coastal village of Phu Nhieu in Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province, several kilometers south of Chu Lai. Reinforced by the battalion‚Äôs Company B, the troops swept toward the village, while the 3rd Brigade‚Äôs reconnaissance platoon and Company B, 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, landed into blocking positions south and west of the town. As the attack progressed, VC who had sought refuge in the village fled into the blocking positions, where small arms fire and gunships cut them down. At a loss of 1 soldier killed and 6 wounded, the Americans claimed 100 VC dead, 7 prisoners and 38 captured weapons. By the end of January 1968 the operation had resulted in 454 VC dead and 103 weapons captured at a cost of 25 US killed. In February 1968 in the aftermath of the Tet Offensive the 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, continued the operation together with Task Force Barker, a group composed of three infantry companies and a partial artillery battery drawn from various parts of the 11th Infantry Brigade that was commanded by the brigade‚Äôs operations officer, Lieutenant colonel Frank A. Barker. It patrolled a sector that lay northeast of Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i City and which included the Batangan Peninsula. Elements from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division guarded the districts immediately surrounding Qu·∫£ng Ngai City. The 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, operated in the southeastern part of the province from the brigade headquarters at Duc Pho. The 11th Infantry Brigade, therefore, had a huge amount of territory to cover, a problem exacerbated by the fact that it was physically split in two by the ARVN zone. In the wake of Tet, Allied units based near Qu·∫£ng Ngai City searched the countryside for the enemy forces that had attacked the provincial capital. The VC had suffered tremendous casualties but would bounce back unless the experienced cadre that formed the nucleus of their units could be destroyed. ARVN troops and US gunships on 6 February killed 50 VC from the 406th Sapper Battalion southwest of Qu·∫£ng Ngai City and another 92 soldiers from the 83rd Local Force Battalion near the same location the next day. The VC 48th Local Force Battalion proved more elusive. The unit typically operated out of the sprawling village of Son My, made up of over a dozen hamlets that dotted the lower coast of the Batangan Peninsula. The community of rice farmers and fisherman had been a Communist stronghold since its founding by Viet Minh supporters in 1945. Technically the area was in the ARVN zone of operations, but the government‚Äôs repeated reluctance or inability to clear the area led the Allies to authorize Task Force Barker to enter Son My in search of the 48th Local Force Battalion. On US military maps, the area surrounding the largest of the settlements, My Lai (1), was colored pink to reflect its VC‚Äìcontrolled status. Before long, the men of Task Force Barker came to refer to the whole area as \\"Pinkville.\\" Although there was some question as to whether the 48th Battalion was recovering from Tet in the village or in the hills to the northwest, Colonel Barker conducted regular sweeps through Son My looking for the unit. Whenever the soldiers from Task Force Barker did so, they faced a landscape that was filled with mines and booby traps. Snipers shot at them from concealment and then vanished without a trace. The Americans rarely caught a glimpse of their foes, in part because the area was riddled with tunnels that the local inhabitants had built to protect themselves and which the VC had turned to their own uses. The villagers, most of whom either actively supported the VC or else were too frightened to resist their demands, almost never warned the Americans when they were in danger. On 25 February when a company walked into an unmarked minefield near the village of Lac Son, the resulting explosions killed 3 Americans and wounded 12 others. The latest intelligence suggested that the headquarters and two companies from the 48th Battalion, some 200 men, had congregated in the hamlet of My Lai (4) and it was also home to some 400 civilians thought to be VC sympathizers. On the morning of 16 March the 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry was landed by helicopters at the edge of My Lai (4) and Company B, 4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry was landed near M·ªπ Kh√™ and they then perpetrated the My Lai Massacre. On 23 April, a VC force led by the 95th Local Force Sapper Company and supported by elements of the 48th Local Force Battalion attacked a hamlet that was occupied by Marine Combined Action Program Team 135. Americal soldiers came to the aid of the defenders and with their help killed some 49 VC. The VC carried away most of the bodies as they withdrew. According to local villagers, one of the dead had been a battalion commander. Aftermath On 10 June the operation was terminated.

She wrote a series of poetical \\"Epistles\\", one \\"To Women\\", another \\"On the Blindness of this Age\\". She also wrote, My Threescore Years (1833); The Twenty-Four Hours of a Sensible Woman; and Cantata on the Marriage of Napoleon. Through her second marriage, she became Princess of Salm-Dyck. Salm was \\"the first woman to be admitted to the Lyceum des Arts\\". Early years Constance-Marie de Th√©is was born in Nantes on September 7, 1767. She was baptized in the parish of Saint-Similien. Her father, Marie-Alexandre de Theis, was a poet who also wrote comedies. During her childhood, her father retired and family moved to Picardy, the family seat, where she received a \\"brilliant education\\". At the age of fifteen, she spoke several languages, and learned musical composition. She also took an early interest in literature, especially poetry. Career In 1789, she married Jean-Baptiste Pipelet de Leury, a surgeon, whose father had been ennobled by a charge of the king, and established herself in Paris, where various pieces of her writing were published in the Almanac des Muses and other periodicals. In 1794, the theater of the Rue de Louvois performed her, Sapho, tragedie melee de chants, a lyric tragedy in three acts and in verse, with music by Jean-Paul-√âgide Martini. This piece, which was preceded by a precise description of the life of Sappho, was quite successful, with more than a hundred performances. She dedicated it to her father, whom died in 1796. She continued to provide fugitive pieces to newspapers and collections. She soon found a place for herself in the top rank of women poets, after writing a series of poems, which she styled as \\"Epitres\\" (Epistles), the first of which, in 1797 was \\"Epitre aux femmes\\", (Epistle to Women) and the most notable, \\"Epitre surl'aveuglementdu siecle\\" (On the Blindness of this Age). Others included \\"Messoixanto ana\\" (1833), \\"Les vingt- quatre heures d'une femme sensible\\", \\"Pensdes\\", and \\"Cantate sur le manage de Napoleon\\". Poetical \\"Epistles\\", \\"Dramas\\", and various other productions in verse, read by Pipelet at the Athenaeum at Paris, and afterwards published, obtained for her an honorable reputation in the literary world. She also published several ballads, of which she composed the melodies and the piano accompaniments. Salm divorced in 1799. She wrote about it in a piece entitled \\"le Divorce, ou Conseils dune M√®re a sa Fille\\" (Divorce, or Advice from a Mother to her Daughter). In 1800, the drama, Camille, ou Amiti√© et imprudence, was withdrawn by Salm after its first performance because of a poor reception, and she did not write for the stage again. In 1803, she married Count Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck, who took the title of prince in 1816. After this marriage, Salm published as the Princesse de Salm. She lived alternately on the estates of her husband, in Germany, and at Paris, where, by her wit, her conversational powers, and her amiable manners, she rallied round her the elite of artists, and people of letters. The numerous productions of Salm were printed under the title, Po√©sies de la princesse Constance de Salm (Poems of the Princess Constance of Salm) in Paris by Didot, in 1811 and a more comprehensive edition in 1817. Salm's poetic works are distinguished by a firm and frank pace, by force of thought, philosophical spirit, and by the habit of using the proper word, which contributes to rendering her style as clear, natural and energetic, without taking away elegance and grace. In June 1833, Salm published, Mes Soixante ans, ou Mes Souvenirs politiques et litteraires (My Sixty Years, or My Political and Literary Memories) (Paris, Bertrand, Didot). Although praised by several newspapers, this work was considered to be mediocre. Salm died in Paris, April 13, 1845.

It was led by businessman Christophe Sapet, co-founder of Infogrames. InfoSources, which Sapet had started as an Internet service provider in 1995, had branched increasingly into content creation since 1998, and had purchased the magazine publishers Pressimage and Freeway in April 2000. As a result, its holdings included a number of youth-oriented magazines and web portals, such as ZoneJeuX. As part of InfoSources' merger with Belgacom, its content division was split off as Ixo, which successfully went public in December 2000. Ixo became the French publisher of Rolling Stone in 2002. That same year, Ixo began a rebranding effort to target \\"urban machismo\\" in its publications. Following a years-long series of setbacks that Strat√©gies described as a \\"descent into hell\\", Ixo filed for bankruptcy in January 2004. Its magazine publishing division was sold off piecemeal to companies such as Cyber Press Publishing and Tests Group as the year progressed. Because it was sold in pieces, over 100 Ixo employees were laid off. The liquidation of Ixo was announced in July 2004, after the firm was unable to find a buyer for the remainder of its business. Publications =GameLive PC= Ixo served as the publisher of the video game magazine GameLive PC, which began circulating in Spain during October 2000. It averaged a circulation of 30,000 copies per issue during its first two years, according to France's Circulation Audit Office, and by 2002 Ixo stated that it was Spain's second-largest computer game magazine. A French edition launched on March 29, 2003, initially as a quarterly release. It switched to a monthly schedule in France after its third issue, by which time its national circulation had reached 60,000 copies, Ixo reported. GameLive PC received praise from outlets such as MeriStation, whose writer Francisco Alberto Serrano remarked that it \\"overshadowed even a magazine so settled in Spain as the dean Microman√≠a\\". Similarly, VidaExtra's C√©sar Saiz called it \\"one of the best magazines about video games\\" in Spain. Each issue of GameLive featured the full version of a game via pack-in CD-ROM. In Spain, the magazine ended suddenly in December 2004, after running for 45 issues. It was one of several closures in the country's print game magazine industry during the period. Key members of GameLive PC went on to found the magazine PC Life.

Trypanosoma forms in a blood smear, the species that causes human trypanosomiasis. David Bruce, a British army captain investigating the cause of sleeping sickness in animals (nagana), had discovered trypanosomes in the blood of a cow in South Africa in 1894 and these were named Trypanosoma brucei in 1899. In 1901, Robert Forde was working at the hospital in Bathurst, Gambia, when he made the first definitive observation of trypanosomes in a human being when he unknowingly found them in the blood of H. Kelly, a 42-year-old steamboat master on the Gambia River who had originally been thought to be suffering from malaria. Kelly had been working on the river for six years and had been ill with malaria on several occasions. Forde thought the \\"small worm-like, extremely active bodies\\" were filiarae (a type of parasitic nematode). Soon after, they were identified as trypanosomes by Joseph Everett Dutton who wrote that it was \\"impossible to decide definitely as to the species, but if on further study it should be found to differ from the other disease producing trypanosomes I would suggest that it be called Trypanosoma gambiens√©\\" (now T. b. gambiense). Towards the end of 1902, Forde clarified in the British Medical Journal that he first saw Kelly in May 1901, excluded malaria and alerted Dutton to the organisms he found in the blood. Forde claimed that it was at his [Forde's] own mention that Dutton recognized the trypanosomes. Around the same time, trypanosomes were discovered in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleeping sickness patients by the Italian physician Aldo Castellani. In 1902, Louis Westenra Sambon raised doubts over Forde and Dutton's priority in discovering the trypanosome, and claimed that they had been preceded by Gustave Nepveu. Sambon accused the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine of overlooking his contributions. This theory was discarded by Ronald Ross who backed Dutton and Forde, and argued that Nepveu had not provided convincing evidence of this. Dutton died in the Congo in 1905 from tick fever that he contracted while researching trypanosomiasis.Joseph Everett Dutton (1879-1905). University of Liverpool.

It is used to study the charge carrier behavior of Organic field-effect transistor. It measures the charge introduced optical transmission variation by directly probing the accumulation charge at the burning interface of semiconductor and dielectric layer where the conduction channel forms. Block diagram of charge modulation spectroscopy setup. Here the photo diode measures the transmission. A direct current plus alternating current signal is applied to the organic field-effect transistor, the AC will be as the reference frequency for the Lock-in Amplifier.  Principles  Unlike ultraviolet‚Äìvisible spectroscopy which measures absorbance, charge modulation spectroscopy measures the charge introduced optical transmission variation. In other words, it reveals the new features in optical transmission introduced by charges. In this setup, there are mainly four components: lamp, monochromator, photodetector and lock-in amplifier. Lamp and monochromator are used for generating and selecting the wavelength. The selected wavelength passes through the transistor, and the transmitted light is recorded by the Photodiode. When the signal to noise ratio is very low, the signal can be modulated and recovered with a Lock-in amplifier. In the experiment, a direct current plus an alternating current bias are applied to the organic field- effect transistor. Charge carries accumulate at the interface between the dielectric and the semiconductor (usually a few nanometers). With the appearance of the accumulation charge, the intensity of the transmitted light changes. The variation of the light intensity () is then collected though the photodetector and lock-in amplifier. The charge modulation frequency is given to Lock-in amplifier as the reference.  Modulate charge at the organic field-effect transistor  Organic Field Effect Transistor: the red layer represents the accumulation charge located at the interface of the dielectric and organic semiconductor. There are four typically Organic field-effect transistor architectures: Top-gate, bottom-contacts; bottom-gate, top- contacts; bottom-gate, bottom-contacts; top-gate, top-contact. In order to create the accumulation charge layer, a positive/negative direct current voltage is applied to the gate of the organic field-effect transistor (positive for the P type transistor, negative for the N type transistor). In order to modulate the charge, an AC voltage is given between the gate and source. It is important to notice that only mobile charge can follow the modulation and that the modulation frequency given to lock-in amplifier has to be synchronous.  Charge modulation spectra  The charge modulation spectroscopy signal can be defined as the differential transmission \\\\bigtriangleup Tdivided by the total transmission T. By modulating the mobile carriers, an increase transmission \\\\bigtriangleup T/T>0 and decrease transmission \\\\bigtriangleup T/T<0 features could be both observed. The former relates to the bleaching and the latter to the charge absorption and electrically induced absorption (electro-absorption). The charge modulation spectroscopy spectra is an overlap of charge-induced and electro-absorption features. In transistors, the electro-absorption is more significant during the high voltage drop. There are several ways to identify the electro- absorption contribution, such as get the second harmonic \\\\bigtriangleup T/T, or probe it at the depletion region. = Bleaching and charge absorption = When the accumulation charge carrier removes the ground state of the neutral polymer, there is more transmission in the ground state. This is called bleaching \\\\bigtriangleup T > 0. With the excess hole or electrons at the polymer, there will be new transitions at low energy levels, therefore the transmission intensity is reduced \\\\bigtriangleup T < 0, this is related to charge absorption. = Electro-absorption = The electro-absorption is a type of Stark effect in the neutral polymer, it is predominant at the electrode edge since there is a strong voltage drop. Electro-absorption can be observed from the second harmonic charge modulation spectroscopy spectra.  Charge modulation microscopy  Charge modulation microscopy is a new technology which combines the confocal microscopy with charge modulation spectroscopy. Unlike the charge modulation spectroscopy which is focused on the whole transistor, the charge modulation microscopy give us the local spectra and map. Thanks for this technology, the channel spectra and electrode spectra can be obtained individually. A more local dimension of charge modulation spectra (around submicrometer) can be observed without a significant Electro- absorption feature. Of course, this depends on the resolution of the optical microscopy. The high resolution of charge modulation microscopy allows mapping of the charge carrier distribution at the active channel of the organic field- effect transistor. In other words, a functional carrier morphology can be observed. It is well known that the local carrier density can be related to the polymer microstructure. Based on Density functional theory calculations, a polarized charge modulation microscopy can selectively map the charge transport associated with a relative direction of the transition dipole moment. The local direction can be correlated to the orientational order of polymer domains. More ordered domains show a high carrier mobility of the organic field-effect transistor device.

It is mother church for the city and a mensal parish and was opened on this site in 1784. At the time, it was the only Roman Catholic church in the city after the repeal of the Penal Laws in the late-18th century. The church features a grotto dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes.  History  In the census of 1782, there were only 365 Catholics recorded living in Belfast. Following a collection from the local Church of Ireland and Presbyterian congregations, funds were donated to the building of St. Mary's Church. The first Mass was celebrated on 30 May 1784 - a Sunday - by Father Hugh O‚ÄôDonnell, the first Parish Priest of Belfast. In the opening ceremony, a company of the Irish Volunteers lined the chapel yard and escorted Father O'Donnell into the building. In 1813, the church's pulpit was donated by the Anglican Vicar of Belfast, Canon Turner, continuing the positive relationship between the Roman Catholic church and the local Protestant congregations. Later, in 1815, St. Patrick's Church was built to accommodate the growing Catholic population of the city. As Belfast's Catholic population grew after the famine, the church was deemed too small and thus architect John O'Neill was contracted to design a church big enough for the burgeoning congregation. Although none of the original church can be seen, in 1868 the church was enlarged and renovated into a new Romanesque style building. In the Marian Year of 1954 a Grotto to Our Lady of Lourdes was established under the auspices of the then Administrator, Fr Bernard MacLaverty - an uncle of the Belfast novelist of the same name. The grotto was created in the gardens surrounding the church by the Belfast architect Padraic Gregory. To mark the bicentenary the sanctuary was renovated in 1983 with work by artist Roy Carroll, a favourite of Cahal Daly, much of this timber furniture was later removed after Daly's departure from the Diocese of Down and Connor. In May‚ÄìAugust 2017, the church underwent a substantial renovation work to repair the roof and walls, and to repave the grotto area.  Present Day  For almost forty years the church was served by clergy from the Mill Hill Fathers, the last of whom left in 2019.http://www.downandconnor.org/blog/2019/08/11/11-august-2019-diocesan- appointments-connor/ The current Administrator is Fr. Timothy Bartlett assisted by a range of retired clergy. The church holds two masses a day from Sunday - Monday, and three a day on Friday and Saturday. The 6pm Mass on both Friday and Saturday are held in the Irish language.

The band is a duo consisting of vocalist/guitarist and founder James Clayton, and drummer Dan Watson, who joined in 2012. Allmusic describes their body of work as containing \\"sadness, paranoia, misery, and dry humor\\", comparing them to AJJ or 'a sarcastic Bright Eyes'. The group have independently released six full length albums. They have previously toured the UK, Ireland, parts of mainland Europe, Australia, and Canada. History After early demos were distributed online, Crywank's debut album James Is Going to Die Soon was released in September 2010. Second album Narcissist on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown followed in April 2012. Clayton enlisted drummer Dan Watson and bassist Tom Connolly to round out a full band for their third full length, Tomorrow Is Nearly Yesterday and Everyday Is Stupid which was released initially in 2013 and issued on vinyl by Chicago label Mutant League Records in 2015. Crywank released the tongue-in-cheek Shameless Valentines Money Grab EP in time for the holiday in 2014. A few weeks later, Clayton also released a Simpsons-inspired EP, Following the Lizard Queen, from the perspective of Langdon Alger, a minor character from the show. The band's fourth LP entitled Don't Piss on Me, I'm Already Dead was released in 2016. According to Crywank the title was inspired by a Simpsons quote. In 2017 Crywank worked with Vancouver record label File Under:Music and their One Song at a Time series to produce a music video for their song Part 2. The band's fifth LP Egg on face. Foot in mouth. Wriggling Wriggling Wriggling. was released in December 2017. The sixth LP entitled Wearing Beige On A Grey Day was released in March 2019. In April 2019 Crywank was one of the headliners at that year‚Äôs Manchester Punk Festival. Crywank announced in 2019 that they were intending to break up after a world tour in the summer of 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was cut short before they could tour round the USA (which they would co- headline with the band Chastity) . On May 1st 2020, Crywank released their seventh and final LP entitled Fist Me 'Til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth. It is the only one of their albums to include drummer Dan Watson on lead vocals for various tracks on the album, and the band describes it as \\"probably [their] weirdest [album]\\". The album contains themes of \\"the importance of self- reflection and also of silliness\\", \\"how the band has affected [their] friendship / how [their] friendship has affected the band\\", and reflection upon the impact of their work. As of now, Crywank is currently on hiatus until they can continue the world tour which, upon ending, so too will the band.

The party was formed in May 1950 with the merger of the Accra Ratepayers' Association and the Manbii Party. It was led by Nii Amaa Ollennu, with Frederick Nanka-Bruce as chairman. It supported a gradual transition self-government, under the slogan \\"Sure, Solid, Self- government\\". It campaigned against Kwame Nkrumah's Convention People's Party (CPP), claiming that the CPP's candidates were inexperienced and extreme, while its candidates were both experienced and respectable. The British colonial officials welcomed the formation of the party, but privately expressed doubts about its popular appeal. At the 1951 Gold Coast legislative election, the party ran in co-ordination with the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC). It also aligned itself with two parties which did not contest the election, the People's Democratic Party, based in Kumasi, and the Independent Party, based in Cape Coast. The party did not win any seats; in the largest constituency, Accra, Ollennu took only 742 votes, and his running mate, Kofi Adumoa Bossman, 666, while Nkrumah won 20,780 and Thomas Hutton-Mills Jr., also of the CPP, 19,812. Two UGCC candidates also beat the NDP. In May 1952, the party merged with the UGCC and dissident members of the CPP, to form the Ghana Congress Party.

Pointing and its object: towards the neuropsychology of objectivation. Rev Neurol (Paris). 1998 May;154(4):283-90. Its name comes from the Greek: \\"hetero\\" which means the other from a pair, \\"a\\" combined with \\"gnosis\\" means without knowledge, and \\"topos\\" means location. This clinical syndrome is distinct from autotopagnosia, another group of cognitive deficits associated with difficulties in locating body parts on own's one body. Allotopagnosia is another related disorder in which the patient cannot point at any external targets except his/her own body parts.  Causes  Heterotopagnosia is a type of brain damage that affects the left parietal lobe, at the parieto-occipital junction, or in the inferior parietal lobe. The brain damage could be an ischemic or an hemorrhagic stroke, or a neurogenerative disorder affecting this region.  Symptoms  Heterotopagnosia is an inability in pointing at another person's body parts associated with a spared ability in pointing one's own body parts. When the patient is asked by the examiner to point at his/her own body parts, he/she shows normal performance. However, when asked to point at the examiner's body parts, the patient erroneously points at his/her own corresponding body parts. For example, when the patient is asked \\"Point at the examiner's nose\\", the patient points at his/her own nose (so-called \\"self- referencing\\" behavior). In typical cases, the patient can point at objects, even those located on the body of other persons. In three reported observations of patients with heterotopagnosia, the ability in touching or grasping other person's body parts was spared.  Diagnosis  = Clinical examination = Heterotopagnosia can be detected by asking several questions: ‚ÄúPoint to your nose‚Äù: the patient shows no error. ‚ÄúPoint to my nose‚Äù: the patient erroneously points to his/her own nose. ‚ÄúPoint to the door, to the ceiling, to my glasses‚Ä¶‚Äù: typically, the patient shows no errors for objects. ‚ÄúWhat is it called?‚Äù (the examiner points to his/her own nose‚Äù: the patient can name the nose of the examiner or any object. = Core syndrome = Based on the different cases reported in the literature, the core syndrome of heterotopagnosia appears to imply: 1) an impaired capacity in pointing at another person's body parts; 2) a spared capacity in pointing at the patient's body parts; 3) a self-referencing behavior is observed when the patient fails to point at another person's body parts (except in the case).Auclair L, Noulhiane M, Raibaut P, Amarenco G. Where are your body parts? A pure case of heterotopagnosia following left parietal stroke. Neurocase. 2009 Dec;15(6):459-65. doi: 10.1080/13554790902911642. = Brain imaging = Brain imaging (CT-scan or MRI or functional imaging) demonstrates a damage to the left posterior parietal, the left parieto-occipital or the inferior parietal region. According to Cleret de Langavant et al.,Cleret de Langavant L, Trinkler I, Cesaro P, Bachoud-L√©vi AC. Heterotopagnosia: When I point at parts of your body. Neuropsychologia. 2009 Jun;47(7):1745-55. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.02.016. an additional lesion in the insular region makes the syndrome of heterotopagnosia long-lasting.  Clinical cases  Sixteen patients with heterotopagnosia have been reported so far in the literature. Those patients all share the striking inability in pointing at another person's body parts, despite normal performance for pointing at their own body. All patients but one show the self-referencing behavior. Despite similarities between the clinical assessments in those sixteen patients, the same tests were not proposed in all patients, yielding discrepancies in the descriptions of impairments. For example, grasping capacities were only tested in four patients and touching in one patient. = Degos et al. (1997) / Degos and Bachoud-L√©vi (1998) = JD Degos and AC Bachoud-L√©vi described for the first time the syndrome of heterotopagnosia in nine patients after a left hemisphere stroke. In 5 of these patients, the deficit was restricted to the body of other persons (pure heterotopagnosia), while for the 4 other patients, the inability to point at external targets included both other persons' body and objects (allotopagnosia). Three patients with heterotopagnosia could perfectly point at body parts of pictures of human body and another patient with heterotopagnosia could point at body parts of a doll. The authors described for the first time the self-referencing behavior typical in heterotopagnosia and allotopagnosia, by which patients point at their own body instead of pointing at another person's one. One patient with heterotopagnosia had better performance for grasping other person's body parts than for pointing at them. Another patient with heterotopagnosia recovered from this disorder after eight days and offered a narrative of his experience: he could see the body parts of other persons but could not locate them, and acknowledged confusing between the body of other persons and his own. The authors interpreted this disorder as an impairment in the process of pointing itself. = Felician et al. (2003) = O Felician and collaborators described two patients showing a typical double dissociation. The first patient suffered from autotopagnosia, with a selective deficit in pointing to own body parts and a spared ability to point to the body parts of others. The second patient demonstrated symptoms of pure heterotopagnosia, with a selective inability to point to another person's body parts, a self-referencing behavior, and a spared capacity to point to own body. The patient with heterotopagnosia could point at objects whether at a reaching distance, in the room or on the examiner's body. The patients could point at parts of animals or of complex objects. This patient could point at body parts of a picture of a human body, at parts of a mask, whether held by the examiner or onto the examiner's face, or at parts of a face visible onto a TV screen, whether still or moving. The patient with heterotopagnosia had decreased brain perfusion in the left inferior parietal lobe, while the patient with autotopagnosia had decreased perfusion in the left superior parietal lobe.Felician O, Ceccaldi M, Didic M, Thinus-Blanc C, Poncet M. Pointing to body parts: a double dissociation study. Neuropsychologia. 2003;41(10):1307-16. = Auclair et al. (2008) = L Auclair and collaborators described the case of a patient with heterotopagnosia, with impaired pointing performance for other persons‚Äô body parts but also for other human body representations. A qualitative analysis of pointing errors showed that the patient did not exhibit a self-referencing behavior. Brain imaging identified a left parieto-occipital hemorrhagic stroke. = Cleret de Langavant et al. (2009) = L Cleret de Langavant and collaborators described three patients with long-lasting heterotopagnosia, in contrast with most patients with this syndrome that rapidly recover after few hours or days. The three patients had typical heterotopagnosia, with severe impairment for pointing at other person's body parts, especially the body of the examiner (‚Äúpoint to my nose‚Äù), but also for a third person (‚Äúpoint to his nose‚Äù). Patients showed better performance when pointing at non-living representations of humans (dolls, pictures, drawings) or at objects. In one patient, pointing performance improved when he was instructed to consider the target person as a doll. In the three patients, grasping other person's body (or touching for one patient) was by far easier than pointing at another person's body parts. All three patients had a left posterior parietal lesion and a lesion in the insula, either left or right. The authors suggested that the left posterior parietal lesion was necessary to occur to observe heterotopagnosia, but that the associated insular lesion was the reason for the long-lasting effect of the parietal lesion. = Cleret de Langavant et al. (2016) = L Cleret de Langavant and collaborators reported the unusual case of a female patient with primary progressive aphasia of the logopenic type and with heterotopagnosia who was more accurate in pointing to men's body parts than to women's body parts. She exhibited the self-referencing behavior and better pointed at objects than at other person's body parts. She also better grasped women's body parts than she could point at them. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the left parietal region and of the left frontal cortex.Cleret de Langavant L, Jacquemot C, Cruveiller V, Dupoux E, Bachoud-L√©vi AC. Pointing to others: How the target gender influences pointing performance. Cogn Neuropsychol. 2016 Jul-Sep;33(5-6):343-51. doi: 10.1080/02643294.2016.1209175. = Bassolino et al. (2019) = M Basolino and collaborators studied the case of a patient with heterotopagnosia and self-referencing behavior after a left parieto-occipital hemorrhagic stroke due to a cerebral arterioveinous malformation which was surgically treated. This patient showed deficits in pointing at another person's body parts, but also at body parts on a drawing of human body, on a doll and on a picture of a human body. The patient could locate the body parts of three different animals without errors. The authors used a virtual reality setting in order to test the respective influence of somatosensory and visual inputs in the disorder of this patient.Bassolino M, Bouzerda-Wahlen A, Moix V, Bellmann A, Herbelin B, Serino A, Blanke O, You or me? Disentangling perspectival, perceptual, and integrative mechanisms in heterotopagnosia CORTEX, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2019.05.017.  Interpretations  Considering the clinical description of their cases, the different authors attempted to provide an interpretation of the complex behavior of patients with heterotopagnosia, which remains debated. = An objectivization disorder? = According to Degos and collaborators, accurate pointing requires two complementary representations at cognitive levels: 1) an egocentric visuo-proprioceptive representation which extends somato-sensori inputs from the subject's body to the visual inputs from the extrapersonal space; 2) an objective representation by which the target of pointing is singled out from the first visuo-proprioceptive continuum. The body of other persons would be easily matched to the subject's body through brain mechanisms such as mirror neurons and thus more difficult to single out in the objective representation, yielding heterotopagnosia. = A category-specific disorder affecting human body-specific visuospatial representations? = Felician and collaborators argue that pointing to body parts is a category-specific behavior that relies on both somatosensory representations and body-specific visual representations. In case of damage of somatosensory representations, autotopagnosia could be observed, while in case of body-specific visual representations, it would be heterotopagnosia. = An impairment of self-other distinction and spatial coding of human body parts? = Auclair and collaborators acknowledge the role of the left parietal region for human body parts representations, and suggest that this region could participate in the distinction between self and other's body. = A difficulty in viewing another person‚Äôs body as an object? = Cleret de Langavant and collaborators recalled that pointing is a communicative gesture that necessarily involves a first person who points, a second person to whom the pointing gesture is addressed, and an object, the target of the pointing gesture. Within this triadic setting, only the first two are truly persons while the object or third person is essentially a non-person. According to these authors, two spatial reference frames (or representations) should exist for any pointing gesture: an egocentric representation that accounts for the first person's perspective and a heterocentric representation that accounts for the second person's perspective (the egocentric space from the addressee's perspective). Heterotopagnosia would arise from the inabily to conceive at the same time another humain as an addresse, with a heterocentric perspective, and as an object, deprived from this heterocentric perspective. They summarize heterotopagnosia as an inability to view another person's body as an object.Cleret de Langavant L, Trinkler I, Remy P, Thirioux B, McIntyre J, Berthoz A, Dupoux E, Bachoud-L√©vi AC. Viewing another person's body as a target object: a behavioural and PET study of pointing. Neuropsychologia. 2012 Jul;50(8):1801-13. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.04.005. = An inability to integrate self-related somatosensory information with others‚Äô body visual information? = Bassolino and collaborators used virtual reality to test the respective role of identity of the human body (self versus other) and of the perspective onto that body (first person perspective versus third person perspective) in heterotopagnosia. They proposed that heterotopagnosia could stem from a difficulty in the integration of self-related somatosensory signals with other-body-related visual information.

The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet for her entire career. She was one of the ships deployed to Denmark during the First Schleswig War of 1848‚Äì50. She took part in the defence of Sweaborg during the Crimean War. Rossiya was decommissioned in 1856 and sold for scrap in 1860. Description The constructor of Rossiya was Alexander Popov (father of the future admiral Andrei Popov). She was built as a First-rate 120-gun ship of the line. She was long between perpendiculars (195 ft keel), with a beam of about (55 feet and 4 or 8 inches according to various sources) and a depth of hold of about (24 feet 11 inches or 25 feet 1 inch according to various sources). She displaced 4,904 tons. At first she was equipped with an experimental uniform armament of 60-pounder cannons: long, short and gunnades on the lower, middle and upper decks, respectively, with the 60-pounder carronades on the forecastle and quarterdeck. Officially, these 60-pounders were considered as 48-pounders. Uniform armament of such a large caliber was installed on such a large ship of the Russian fleet for the first time. In 1854 and 1855, instead of the 60-pounders, 36-pounder gunnades and carronades were listed and part of the short 60-pounder guns were replaced by 36-pounder guns. The two 96-pounder carronades that were listed in 1839 disappeared later. Also at different times, several 2-pood or 1.5-pood shell guns were listed. Career The ceremonial launch of the ship in the waters of Neva River took place on 5 July 5, 1839. The ship was tested in 1840 and in subsequent years sailed in the Baltic Sea (not further than Denmark). She was one of the ships sent to Denmark during the First Schleswig War of 1848‚Äì50 to help preserve Denmark's territorial integrity against Prussia. After the start of the Crimean War, she was based at the naval fortress Sweaborg (near Helsinki) with the Third Division of the Russian Baltic Fleet, while most of the Fleet took up positions in Kronstadt, on the outskirts of St. Petersburg. During the bombardment of Sweaborg on 28 July 1855, she took up an enfilading position between Bakholmen and Gustafsvard islands. Defending the position she received 85 holes, the crew lost 11 people killed and 89 wounded. At night, she left this position. According to Andrew Lambert, this was achieved by Stork and Snapper gunboats, armed with Lancaster guns. Rossiya was decommissioned in 1856; from 1857 she was used as a floating barracks and she was sold for scrap in 1860.

As one side speaks, the other is veiled, but they both assure him that whatever he hungers after will be provided. On waking, a feeling of irritation provokes him to think that unless life is easy, and lived effortlessly, it is better to die. Sitaramrao's uncle turns down a request for a loan, replying that Sitaramrao's father had treated him poorly: it was he who built the family's wealth, which Sitaramrao's father had squandered, and in his view, the son was behaving as his father had. Sitaramrao in turn insults his uncle. He begins to act strangely, beating in succession his daughter and his wife, and talking to a gecko. He drifts into fantasies of becoming a robber and raping a woman. He takes to wandering in bazaars, singing or haranguing passers-by. He visits a prostitute, then challenges a speaker addressing a meeting and is beaten up, whereupon the wise Ramayya takes him to the shelter of a rain tree, and tries unsuccessfully to reason with him so that he might mend his ways and return home. One day, sitting alone, Sitaramrao cries out \\"All is illusion\\" and walks to the cremation grounds, where he imagines seeing his father rolling his eyes, gnashing his teeth and chastising him as a wastrel. His own shadow seems to join with his father and attack him. The following day Ramayya passes by and, on examining the torn bones and scattered flesh there, identifies the mangled body as that of Sitaramrao. Analysis The novel was first published in 1947. The major portions of the narration is a stream of consciousness of the protagonist, Sitaramrao. Set in an unstated year during the 1940s, the story occurs in an unnamed village in Andhra Pradesh, on its way to becoming a town. Sitaramrao inherited megalomania from his father and this theme pervades the novel. Sitaramrao's father's death-bed demand that he maintain the prestige of the family is a key point in Sitaramrao's life, causing an inner conflict between the self-aggrandizement which he inherited from his father and the gentler, more sensitive feelings from his mother's side. He is dominated by the former, which deprives him of his commonsense; as a result hunger, marriage, procreation and maintaining a family appear to be trivial and mean concerns to him. Paradoxically, when Sitaramrao falls in love himself, marries and has children, he considers this to be unnatural. His life and family is shattered due to his uncompromising character, but he attributes his misfortunes to others, and not to his own flaws. He tries to rationalise his defects, at the same time withdrawing into an imaginary world failing even to hold on to his job. When his maternal uncle deceives him, he thinks it a sign of his greatness that he does not concern himself with money matters. He cannot act against external events, only himself. He is sensitive enough to understand when others are hurt, but cannot express this to them. His wife Indira understands him and he loves her for this, nevertheless he is unable to express his love to her. He blames her for his own failings and the consequent inner turmoil sends him mad and leads to his death. Reception and criticism Considered to be a classic of modern Telugu literature, the novel is the best-known psychological novel in Telugu. It is regarded as the first psychological novel in Telugu literature and influenced the later development of Telugu writing. It was translated into English by D. S. Rao under the title The Bungler (2003). Lipipuspa Nayak observes, in her review, that \\"the novel seems to falter in the last chapter that narrates the transition of the protagonist from an incompetent illusionist, unable to overcome the hangover of the family values to a schizophrenic who eventually commits suicide.\\" However, she notes that the end of the novel is thematically reasonable. She found the progression of protagonist from a romantic rebel to a questioning philosopher and a compulsive campaigner for his views to be \\"abrupt\\".

Career  = Development consulting = During 2001-2018, Yuriy Dzhygyr was engaged in provision of technical advice to governments in Ukraine, Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, East Asia and Pacific regions on developing and implementing budget reforms and promoting sound budgeting practices at national and sub-national levels. He worked as an individual expert and as a director of a commercial consultancy, FISCO id, which he set up in 2006. Within one of the projects, Dzhygyr co-authored a research initiative to understand the failures in the governance and financing of Ukraine‚Äôs healthcare system . This work was later used to develop Ukraine‚Äôs health financing reform and to design global indicators of healthcare system governance,. = Public service and contribution to post-Maidan reforms = After the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, Dzhygyr spent four years working as a non-staff adviser to Ukraine‚Äôs new government, concentrating on health financing and fiscal decentralization. He was in the core team designing the 2017 health financing reform, calling to replace the Post-Soviet centralized and hierarchical Semashko-type system with a tax-based funding model involving a national level single-payer,. In early 2018, Dzhygyr has proposed a new approach to financing national public broadcasting in Ukraine. He suggested funding Ukraine‚Äôs National Public Broadcasting Company, NPBC by earmarking 50% of the rent charged by the state for the use of radio frequency resource. This was proposed as a measure to make NPBC funding more transparent and to protect it from political influencing. This approach was supported by the Supervisory Board of the NPBC as ‚Äúone of the most reliable options‚Äù and ‚Äúin line with the Council of Europe recommendations‚Äù and was approved by the Board as its formal proposal for reform on 5 April 2018. The idea was also supported by the EU-Ukraine Civil Society Platform (a joint EU-Ukraine civil society organization set up as a requirement of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement). However, as of August 2019, it remained in consideration by the Government and was not yet introduced in practice, On 26 July 2018, Dzhygyr was appointed as Ukraine‚Äôs Deputy Minister of Finance to cover public spending in social and humanitarian sectors. In this office, Dzhygyr continued to oversee healthcare financing as well as public spending on social protection, education, science, culture and sports. One of the key reforms during Dzhygyr‚Äôs time in office was the on-going transformation of Ukraine‚Äôs program of subsidies on housing and utilities payments for poor households, the country‚Äôs key social assistance scheme. The reform entailed ‚Äúmonetization‚Äù of subsidies, whereby the recipients would be granted in cash instead of payment discounts,. He was also working on the a wide-scale intervention to verify the databases of subsidy recipients to identify fraud and mistakes \\\\- a measure which proved highly unpopular, but led to considerable budget savings. As a deputy Minister of Finance, Dzhygyr was also promoting introduction of a new funding mechanism for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). This involved replacing line- item funding of a pre-selected range of research facilities with a competitive grant scheme through a newly established National Research Fund. After the change of Government in Ukraine in 2019, Dzhygyr was re-appointed at his post of the Deputy Minister of Finance.

He made his professional debut in May 1937 and reached the top division in May 1942. His highest rank was sekiwake. He won six gold stars against grand champion yokozuna in the course of his career. Upon retirement from active competition he became an elder in the Japan Sumo Association under the name Kataonami. He left the Sumo Association in September 1952.  Life and career  Shoichi joined Nishonoseki stable at the age of 15 years old making his debut in the 1937 Natsu (Summer) Basho and taking the shikona or ring name of Kamikaze meaning divine wind. He would steadily climb the ranks suffering only one make-koshi or losing record and winning the Makushita division yusho on his way to the Juryo division. He would make quick work of the Juryo division spending just two basho there before making his Makuuchi debut. In the 1942 Haru (Spring) Basho he would make his top division debut at the rank of Maegashira 18. He would do well there finishing with an 11-4 winning record. He would jump up the banzuke to maegashira 6 but could not manage a winning record, finishing 7-8. Despite this he would still rise up the ranks to maegashira 5. This happened fairly often during these times and was due to the fact that East ranked and West ranked wrestlers were treated as two separate groups and if enough wrestlers from one side received bad losing records, other wrestlers from the same side had to be promoted to replace their slot in the rankings for the next tournament even if their records were not much better. Here he would get a 9-6 record which was enough to place him at the top maegashira 1 rank. At this rank he would get his first kinboshi with a win over Yokozuna Akinoumi on day 9 but would finish with just a 5-10 record sending him back down the banzuke. In the following basho ranked at maegashira 4 he would go 11-4 earning him promotion to the sanyaku ranks. In May 1944 making his sanyaku debut at the rank of Komusubi he would go 8-2 including a win over Yokozuna Terukuni on day 5. For the following basho in November of the same year he would be promoted to the rank of Sekiwake and managed a 5-5 record which would see him demoted. Kamikaze would briefly change his name to Kaizan Taro for the year of 1945. In the summer 1945 tournament in the midst of regular allied bombings, Kaizan had one of his worst top division tournaments of his career. It had been scheduled to be held on the Meiji Shrine grounds in May but had been postponed due to the bombings. The tournament was moved to the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan which itself was regularly closed due to the air raids. Under these conditions and with a truncated tournament of only seven days that was closed to the public, Kaizan, at komusubi, could manage just a 2-5 record. he was demoted down to maegashira 4 following this performance. Here he would finish with a 5-5 record and claim his second kinboshi, again from Akinoumi. He would revert to his original shikona of Kamikaze Shoichi following this tournament. The following year only the Aki (Autumn) Basho was held. Back at the rank of komusubi he would get a 7-6 record and gaining him promotion back to sekiwake. In the following Natsu Basho in 1947 at the rank of Sekiwake he would finish with a score of 7-3 including wins over ≈åzeki Maedayama and Shionoumi on days 7 and 8 respectively. The following Basho he would have to pull out on day 6 having just won win over ≈åzeki Nayoroiwa to his name. He would see himself a ways down the banzuke in his return the following Basho at maegashira 6 ‚Äì his lowest ranking since 1942. Here he would post a good 8-3 winning record. At maegashira 1 the following tournament he would get 7-4 record including his third and fourth kinboshi over Yokozuna Maedayama and Terukuni on days 4 and 5 respectively. Shoichi would have a fair start to his 1949 campaign posting 7-5-1 and 8-7 both at komusubi before injury would cause him to pull out midway in the Aki Basho finishing with just a 4-7-4 record. He would come back after this in the 1950 Haru Basho putting up 9-6 record including two kinboshi from Yokozuna Azumafuji and Haguroyama on days 2 and 4 respectively. The 1950 Natsu Basho proved to be his last, after starting with 5 straight loses he would pull out on day 6 and announce his retirement from sumo. Retirement from sumo He would stay on as a coach at Nishonoseki stable under the name Kataonami Oyakata.

It was formed from the merger of L3 Technologies (formerly L-3 Communications) and Harris Corporation on June 29, 2019, and is expected to be the sixth-largest defense contractor in the world.  History  The \\"Harris Automatic Press Company\\" was founded by Alfred S. Harris in Niles, Ohio, in 1895. The company spent the next 60 years developing lithographic processes and printing presses before acquiring typesetting company Intertype Corporation. In 1967, they merged with Radiation, Inc. of Melbourne, Florida, a developer of antenna, integrated circuit and modem technology used in the space race. The company headquarters was moved from Cleveland to Melbourne in 1978. On May 29, 2015, Harris finalized the purchase of competitor Exelis Inc., almost doubling the size of the original company. L-3 Communications was formed in 1997 to acquire certain business units from Lockheed Martin that had previously been part of Loral Corporation. These units had belonged to Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta, which had merged three years before in 1993. The company was founded by (and named for) Frank Lanza and Robert LaPenta in partnership with Lehman Brothers. Lanza and LaPenta had both served as executives at Loral and Lockheed. The company continued to expand through mergers and acquisitions to become one of the top ten U.S. government contractors. At the end of 2016, the company changed its name from L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. to L3 Technologies, Inc. to better reflect the company's wider focus since its founding in 1997. In October 2018, Harris and L3 announced an all-stock \\"merger of equals\\". The merger was completed on June 29, 2019, and the new company, L3Harris Technologies, Inc., is based in Melbourne, Florida, where Harris was headquartered.  Business organization  L3Harris is organized under four business segments: Integrated Mission Systems, Space & Airborne Systems, Communication Systems, and Aviation Systems. It is led by a 12-member board of directors, including Chairman and CEO William M. Brown (former Harris CEO) and President and COO Chris Kubasik (former L3 CEO). According to merger documents Brown is planning to transition to Executive Chairman in 2021, with Kubasik taking over the CEO role, and Kubasik will become both Chairman and CEO the following year. = Integrated Mission Systems = Headquartered in Palm Bay, Florida, Integrated Missions Systems specializes in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, electrical and electronic systems for maritime use, and electro-optical systems including infrared, laser imaging, and targeting systems.

The small, fusiform shell is slightly elongated. The thickened shell is shiny, with a purple lilac coloration on the upper whorls, below the yellow protoconch. On the penultimate whorl and the body whorl, a light white band occupies the middle, becoming more intense on the dorsal part of the body whorl. At this point, the 5th and 6th ribs become discolored and turn white, especially at the opening of the outer lip, where the white coloring broadens and extends more or less. The shell contains 6 whorls. The 1¬Ω embryonic yellow whorls are rounded and smooth. The next whorls are oblate-convex, compressed at the suture and very briefly angular at the top. The shell is reticulate (quite tight in the upper whorls, more expanded at the body whorl) with a granular, high mesh network produced by the intercrossing of vertical rounded, rather strong ribs and 3 strong decurrent cords. The body whorl is convex, slightly depressed toward the base, below the 5th and 6th ribs, which are stronger than the others. The aperture is elongated, narrow, with the same color as the shell. The columella is purplish. The outer edge is oblate-convex in the upper part but substantially swollen on the fifth and sixth ribs, which show a white appearance, and protrudes on the aperture. The aperture is thickened on the last rib, crenelated on the sharp outer lip and furnished inside with 5 denticulate folds. The subsutural sinus cuts rather deep into the thickening of the outer lip, where it expands and becomes rounded.Hervier R.P.

Michael is an American infectious disease researcher. He has served for nearly 30 years in the United States Army and been directly involved with significant advancements in understanding the pathology of and vaccine development for diseases like HIV, Zika, Ebola and more. Much of his career has been spent at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  Career  = Early career = Michael graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1979 with a degree in biology and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army through the ROTC program. His father, a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, performed the ceremony. Subsequently, he attained a medical degree and Ph.D. degree in cancer biology from Stanford University in 1986. He continued his training in internal medicine at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital from 1986 to 1989, after which he entered active service in the U.S. Army. =HIV Research= Upon entering active Army service, Michael joined the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research's department of vaccine research, division of retrovirology. He eventually served as the director of the U.S. Military HIV Research Program for 12 years between 2006 and 2018. Under his leadership, MHRP completed the groundbreaking RV144 vaccine trial in 2009. The trial, testing a prime-boost vaccine regimen, was an international collaboration involving partners from the Thai and U.S governments, private companies and non-profit organizations as well as 16,000 Thai volunteers. Critically, it was the first study to demonstrate modest efficacy from an HIV vaccine regimen, demonstrating that an efficacious vaccine was possible. The wealth of data generated by the trial still informs current vaccine development. Michael also continued MHRP's longstanding research into effective diagnostics and a functional cure. For his excellence as an HIV researcher and leader in global health, he received the Hero of Military Medicine Award for the U.S. Army. =Emerging Infectious Diseases= Michael has also participated in U.S. Army programs to respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks around the world. Amidst the West African Ebola virus epidemic, Michael and other WRAIR researchers published a study in 2015 showing that vaccines for Ebola and Marburg viruses are safe and well tolerated separately and together ‚Äì the first clinical trial to assess an Ebola virus vaccine and Marburg virus vaccine in an African population. Amidst the Zika virus epidemic, as the Zika virus began to threaten U.S. service members stationed in the southern United States, WRAIR was tasked by the U.S. Army to develop a vaccine countermeasure against the disease. With Michael serving as the project's co-lead, scientists developed a vaccine candidate, completed preclinical trials and initiated human clinical trials in 10 months. WRAIR assets that were dedicated to addressing this and previous outbreaks were solidified in 2018 into a formal research branch specifically tasked to identify emerging disease threats. For his work on Zika, Ebola and other infectious diseases, Michael has received significant media attention: he was included in a New Yorker article about the vaccine development and named one of Vice Motherboard's 2017 ‚ÄòHumans of the Year‚Äô. Michael has recently expanded his research interest to bacteriophage therapies, overseeing a Department of Defense-wide task force into the emerging treatment strategy. =Other= During his career, Michael has served on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, Vaccine Research Center Scientific Advisory Working Group (NIAID, NIH), Office of AIDS Research Advisory Committee (NIH), AIDS Research Advisory Committee (NIAID, NIH), AIDS Vaccine Research Working Group (DAIDS, NIAID, and NIH), Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology Scientific Advisory Board, Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator Scientific Steering Committee, the Scientific Committee of the Global HIV AIDS Vaccine Enterprise and the PEPFAR Scientific Advisory Board.

She was the oldest female SOE agent sent to France, serving there from 31 October 1942 until 16 August 1943. She worked as a courier with the code name of Adele. Her husband and brother-in-law were also SOE agents and she worked closely with them.  Early life  Little about Le Ch√™ne's early life is included in her SOE file. Her birth name is not recorded. She was born in 1890, although some sources say 1887. She was the oldest of three children. Early in World War II, she fled France for London with her husband Henri and brother-in-law, Pierre. In London she worked as a cook and manager in a hotel. Her husband, although born in France, was a British citizen who had managed a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya. She declined to join Charles de Gaulle's resistance organization, but joined the SOE on 16 May 1942. Her husband and brother-in-law were already in SOE and had departed England for France a few weeks earlier.O'Connor, Bernard (2018), SOE Heroines, Stroud, Gloucestershire: Amberly Publishing, p. 164 World War II At the outbreak of the war, she refused to join the Gaullist secret services and was engaged by the Special Operations ExecutiveNational Archives : HS 9/304/1 - Henri Paul Le CHENE and Marie-Therese Le CHENE despite being aged 52.

On the night of 3/4 November 1942 she was landed by boat at Port Miou, near Cassis in southern France, with SOE agents George Starr, organiser of WHEELWRIGHT; Mary Herbert, courier for SCIENTIST; and Odette Sansom courier for SPINDLE. She joined her husband, Henri Le Ch√™ne, organiser of the SPRUCE network in Lyon.Brooks Richards, Secret Flotillas: the Clandestine Sea Lines to France and French North Africa, HMSO, 1996. Le Ch√™ne began as courier for the SPRUCE network, and her role changed to the distribution of political pamphlets and anti-German leaflets as far as Marseilles. During a visit to Clermont-Ferrand she discovered that the workers at the Michelin factory were sabotaging production and delivering inferior tyres to the Germans.Bernard O'Connor, Blackmail Sabotage: Attacks on French industries during World War Two, lulu.com, 2016 In January 1943 Henri Le Ch√™ne considered that listening to the BBC in France meant that the distribution of leaflets had lost its utility, and fled the country via the Pyrenees, but was jailed in Spain. Too tired to join him in the rigorous crossing of the Pyrenees, Marie-Th√©r√®se Le Ch√™ne hid in friends' homes and was evacuated by the SOE from Angers on 19 August 1943. Back in England, she rejoined her husband who had escaped from a Spanish jail.

The program is part of the Trinity College Office of Study Away, with students from various other liberal arts colleges enrolled in the program every year. Undergraduate students take classes and workshops that vary across all topics of interdisciplinary art, including acting, dance, performance art, puppetry, site-specific theatre, playwriting, directing, and media-based performance. Each student works at an internship/field study in an arts organization twice a week. Students also attend 3-4 shows a week in all disciplines of performance. Throughout the semester, students create and showcase original pieces, with a final performance presented at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club and at Trinity College in Hartford, CT. The Trinity/La MaMa office and classes take place at the La MaMa Rehearsal Studios. The students are housed at the 92nd Street Y. The program has admitted students from dozens of colleges throughout the country since its inception.  Background  In 1983, the theater and dance departments of Trinity College were combined to create one Theater & Dance department. Spear headed by Trinity professor and La MaMa artist, Judy Dworin, this change provided a platform for the development of Trinity/La MaMa. In 1985, Dworin, along with Leonardo Shapiro, director/founder of the Shaliko Company, brought a group of Trinity students to visit New York City to explore the downtown performance scene and museums. The trip's primary goal was to expose the Theater & Dance students to the booming emergence of the multi-disciplinary landscape of New York. From the success of this first visit, along with Dworin and Shapiro's artistic affiliations with La MaMa and La MaMa founder Ellen Stewart's passion towards education in the performing arts, Trinity/La MaMa celebrated its first semester in 1986. = 1986 - Early 1990s = From 1986 to 1992, Shapiro acted as Program Director. During this period, the program hosted many guest artists to teach the students, including Ping Chong, Bill Irwin, Steve Paxton, Cecil McKinnon, Nina Martin, Eiko & Koma, Anne Bogart, Cathy Weis, Yoshiko Chuma, The Living Theatre, and Robbie McCauley. Specialty classes included voice, physical theatre, acting and text, kinetic awareness, piano, and the following dance forms: modern dance, jazz, ballet, African dance, Flamenco dance, and contact improvisation. The program took a hiatus in 1993. In its place was a summer program led by Bulgarian theater director, Damyan Popchristov, in collaboration with the Nikitsky Gate Theater and Trinity College. This summer program would continue until 1999.Dworin, Judy.

The program would continue to work with guest artists for ongoing classes and workshops, including Lenora Champagne, Olga Lebedeva, Lisa Race, Patricia Hoffbauer, Maureen Fleming, Claire Porter, Jonathan Hart Makwaia, Lynn Moffat, Tiffany Mills, Joan MacIntosh, and Jonah Emsig. From 2000 to 2001, upon Popchristov's departure from the program, performance artist George Emilio Sanchez took on the role as interim Artistic Director. From 2001 to 2005, interdisciplinary performance artist Roberto Sifuentes took on the role of Artistic Director. In 2001, the Trinity/La MaMa Advisory Board was established, containing faculty members from Trinity College, Amherst College, Brown University, Oberlin College, and Ohio University.  Spring Semesters  From 2004 to 2005, the program had both a spring semester and a fall semester. The spring semester was a notably different format. With its focus on solo performance, independent rehearsal, and field studies geared more towards apprenticeships, the spring semester had a class size between 3-5 students. Upon the departure of Sifuentes in 2006, the program returned to a fall-only program. = 2006 - 2017 = In 2006, performance artist Michael Burke became Program Director. During his time as director, the program went through various changes. From 2006 to 2012, the semester was referred to as the Trinity/La MaMa Urban Arts Semester.

The attackers initially detonated a bomb-laden truck, after which five gunmen entered a nearby building under construction and fired on Afghan security personnel evacuating people onto the street. At least forty-five were killed, including the five attackers. The spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, Wahidullah Mayar, said that 116 civilians, including 26 children and 5 women, were wounded. The Taliban claimed the responsibility for the bomb attack in Kabul and said although civilians were not the Taliban target, some were injured.  Background  The attack occurred during the ongoing Taliban‚ÄìUnited States peace talks in Doha, Qatar. In the days before the attack, the militant group carried out multiple deadly attacks on security forces all across the country. According to The New York Times, the violence in Afghanistan has increased during the 18th year of the United States military presence in Afghanistan.  Attack  The Taliban attacked Afghanistan's capital housing military and government buildings using a powerful car bomb on 1 July 2019, and a gunfight began soon after. The attacks killed 40 civilians and injured 116. The bomb exploded during the morning in Kabul when the streets were filled with people. The attack happened in two stages. The first was the detonation of a truck or minibus bomb, packed full of explosives, in central Kabul. The explosion happened in the Puli Mahmood Khan area of the Wazir Akbar Khan neighborhood during rush hour. The area houses many government, diplomatic, and military buildings and installations. The blast was powerful, shaking buildings up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, sending a plume of smoke in the air and destroying many cars and buildings. At least 51 students were injured during the blast, which damaged two nearby schools and shattered windows of three others. The Pashto media organization Shamshad TV said their office was hit by the blast, with one security guard killed and several journalists wounded. The TV station aired images of broken glass and the damage to its office in the aftermath of the bombing. The New York Times reported that 40 people were killed in the car bombing, 34 civilians and 6 security forces. After the explosion, five attackers entered a nearby building under construction and opened fire on security personnel in the street, sparking a gunfight. The shootout lasted for over 7 hours until all 5 attackers were killed by responders. The spokesman for the Ministry of Interior Affairs, Nasrat Rahimi, said after the explosion, attackers entered the Ministry of Defense building, and two car bombs exploded separately near the museum site and the television site. The attackers had been surrounded by the ministry security forces and one of them was killed. He finally added that a child, a security guard of Shamshad TV, and 2 soldiers of the Special Forces were killed during the attack incident and more than 210 people had been rescued during the operation. An office belonging to the Afghan Football Federation was damaged during the incident, and its chief, Yosuf Kargar, and several players injured. The Afghanistan Ministry of Education spokesman, Nooria Nazhat, announced that 51 students from two schools near the blast site were hurt by flying shards of glass, and the explosion resulted in part of the school collapsing.  Responsibility  The Taliban militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that it attacked \\"the defence ministry‚Äôs technical installation\\". Zabihullah Mujahid, one of two official spokesmen for the Taliban, mentioned on a Twitter account that a logistics and engineering unit of the Ministry of Defense was the intended target. He added that people were not the target of attacks, but some of them have been wounded.  Aftermath  Many of the people wounded in the attack were taken into local hospitals, including many schoolchildren. Social media images reportedly showed some of the children in the hospital still holding books and wearing school uniforms. After the attack, many residents and lawmakers criticized security and intelligence agencies, demanding to know how a truck full of explosives and five attackers managed to enter the area, which contains many secure buildings and compounds, among them the United States embassy and the Kabul Presidential Palace. = Reactions =  Domestic  The Afghan government itself also condemned the attacks, with Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani saying that \\"the Taliban, by conducting terrorist attacks, has demonstrated its vicious designs in killing Afghans and the continuation of the war in Afghanistan\\".  International  *Shah Mahmood Qureshi reacted to a coordinated deadly attack by Taliban group in Kabul city, calling it an act of terrorism.

Early life and career  Ronald Kay was born in Sheffield. His father Ernest (1895-1973) was a cutler who had left school at 13 to work for the firm of George Wostenholm, where he slowly rose through the ranks to achieve the position of sales manager. His mother May (n√©e Friskney) (1898-1946) was originally from Leicester; she taught piano. Ronald was the elder of two children; his sister Shirley (1928-1986) was nearly nine years younger. Ronald gained a scholarship to King Edward VII Grammar SchoolHe returned as guest of honour to present prizes at the school on 21 November 1967: see , and subsequently an Edgar Allen scholarship to Sheffield UniversityMentioned in the local paper, probably the Sheffield Independent, around 29 May 1937, in an article titled Golden Wedding Celebrations, section title Hillsborough Couple, which is mainly about Ronald Kay's grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. George Kay, where he read English. Graduating in 1941, he was disqualified from active service as a result of poor eyesight, and instead went to London to work for the Ministry of Shipping where his duties included planning of Atlantic convoys. He shared an office at this time with the composer Gerald Finzi. One of his tasks was to arrange an exchange of prisoners of war on board the neutral Swedish passenger liner, the SS Drottningholm, in October 1943. Eight hundred German prisoners of war were assembled in Leith, Scotland, and sailed to Gothenburg in two British ships; meanwhile 4000 Allied prisoners were transported to Gothenburg and embarked on the Drottningholm and other ships, for return to Leith. After the war, he enrolled with the Control Commission responsible for administering the British Zone of Allied-occupied Germany, and was posted to Hannover, where he was billeted in the family home of his future wife, Brigitte Albert.Brigitte Kay, Growing Up in Germany 1924-1949 The house, in the suburb of Kleefeld, was one of the few left standing after the allied bombing raids. Subsequently he joined the British Council and spent several years lecturing in English at the University of Copenhagen. He married Brigitte in H√∂ver, a village in Sehnde, in 1949. They lived first in Copenhagen, where their first daughter was born, and then in Vienna. With the arrival of a second child they decided to settle in England in 1951, and soon afterwards, Ronald obtained a post as Assistant Registrar at the University of Leeds.  Career in university administration  Ronald Kay is seen here holding an aperture card. Application forms were photographed onto 35mm microfilm slides, each mounted in an 80-column punched card. The holes in the card contained a summary of which universities and courses a candidate was applying to. Punched card sorters and collators were used to batch together applications for the same university and course, which were then fed into a Xerox Copyflo printer which printed the forms at high speed onto rolls of paper (at peak time in December, this used 5Km of paper daily). These were then despatched by post to the relevant institution. Ronald Kay was responsible for admissions at Leeds University in the 1950s when he became aware that major reform was needed to handle the predicted growth in the university system. At that time Leeds was the largest University to have a centralised admissions process. At the suggestion of Sandy Douglas, the University of Leeds' Pegasus computer was used for a project to process the University's matriculation records. This gave Ronald Kay insights into the potential for improving the admissions system through clerical automation. As early as 1951, schools were campaigning for change: the fact that every university had different procedures, different forms, and different timetables made life very difficult for applicants and their advisors. Equally, individual universities, having made an offer to a candidate, had very little idea whether the student would actually show up in October, because there was nothing to stop applicants accepting multiple offers. At a national level, there was no accurate data on the number of successful and unsuccessful candidates, which made it difficult to plan the expansion of the sector expected in the 1960s. An Ad-Hoc Committee to address the problem was set up by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (CVCP) in 1958, and it published a series of reports in quick succession. The Third Report in January 1961 recommended setting up a central agency, which became UCCA. From June 1960 Ronald Kay was secretary of the Working Party responsible for this recommendation. From the beginning it was made clear that responsibility for deciding which candidates to accept or reject would remain firmly with the institutions; the role of the agency would be to control the number of applications made by each candidate, to maintain a record of the progress of those applications, and to impose a date by which candidates must choose between multiple offers. The final details of the scheme were agreed in principle by November 1961, and published in full in May 1962. During the academic year 1961-62 Kay was on full-time secondment from Leeds to set up the operation, holding discussions with computer manufacturers, and arranging premises and staffing for a pilot year of operation to handle the October 1963 entry. Staffing expanded from two (Ronald Kay and a typist) in February 1962, to 25 in September and 40 the following January. Premises at 29 Tavistock Square were rented from London University. During this time Kay was weekly- commuting from Leeds, leaving Brigitte and an au-pair to look after six children aged from 2 to 12. In the summer of 1962, once his permanent appointment was confirmed (the job title was still \\"Secretary\\"), the family relocated to Fleet, Hampshire. Every acceptance and rejection letter from UCCA carried Ronald Kay's signature By 1968 the office had outgrown its London premises and transferred to Rodney Road in Cheltenham: he was keen to find somewhere that was attractive to live, with good schools to provide a potential workforce, with a postal sorting office capable of handling millions of letters a year, and preferably without its own University, to avoid any suggestion of bias. Ronald Kay remained in charge of UCCA until his retirement in 1985. UCCA expanded to become UCAS (adding the former Polytechnics to its remit) in 1992, after Ronald Kay retired, but he was responsible for much of the planning.  Personal life  Ronald Kay's main interest outside work was music. He trained as an Anglican choir-boy, and through his 20s his career aspiration was to be a professional tenor soloist. Despite a number of professional engagements in the Sheffield area, he realised that he would not be able to earn his living this way, and thereafter devoted himself to amateur music-making. In 1944 he sang in the first performance of Michael Tippett's oratorio A Child of Our Time. When UCCA relocated to Cheltenham he joined the Cheltenham Bach Choir, and remained an active member of the tenor section well into retirement, serving at one time as vice-chairman. With the Bach Choir in 1995, he sang in the first performance of John Rutter's Birthday Madrigals. Even in his late 90s, he continued singing regularly with the Heart and Soul Community Choir in Tewkesbury. After retiring from UCCA, he took a part-time post as music correspondent for the Gloucestershire Echo, writing regular reviews of concerts by both local amateurs and visiting professionals, including coverage of the Cheltenham Music Festival. Ronald and Brigitte converted to Roman Catholicism in 1953. Ronald Kay in 2015He was a governor and subsequently chairman of trustees of Charlton Park Convent School in Cheltenham, where his two youngest daughters had been pupils. This was at the time when the girls' convent school merged with the nearby boys' Catholic school, Whitefriars, to form the co-educational St Edward's School, Cheltenham; he therefore found himself managing the detailed negotiations surrounding the merger. The school sold some of its land for housing to finance this development; he bought one of the houses and lived there for the last 30 years of his life. He was a keen cyclist but learned to drive and acquired his first car when already into his sixties, having previously argued that public transport and bicycles, together with liberal use of taxis, was cheaper and more convenient. His marriage to Brigitte lasted 69 years. They lived at home until the end. Brigitte predeceased him by four months, dying in February 2019. They were survived by their six children (Barbara 1950, Michael 1951, Robert 1953, Richard 1955, Eleanor and Jenny 1959), with twelve grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He died (of \\"frailty of old age\\", according to the death certificate) on 17 May 2019, at home with his family around him.  Titles, honours, and awards  * Awarded OBE 1985.

Her focus was on landscapes. There are also many \\"harbour\\" paintings. As a young woman she traveled extensively, but the paintings for which she is chiefly remembered mostly show the north German flatlands of her home region. Biography Toni Elster was born into an established Bremen merchant family. As a young woman she traveled extensively, notably in France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Those experiences left her with an enduring love both of nature and of art. She was evidently still unmarried when she fell seriously ill at the age of 36. Being still unmarried would have been regarded as unusual for middle class women of this generation, although for the generation born a couple of decades later the impact on the gender balance of wars in Africa (and elsewhere) would leave Germany, Britain, and other colonial powers each with a significant surplus of sometimes reluctant spinsters. It was at the age of 36 that Elster was confined to bed by a lengthy and serious illness, and it was only then that she reached the (also unconventional) decision that she should become an artist. On her recovery, in 1897 she relocated to Munich where she produced her early works which were mostly water colours. She also began to take lessons from the well regarded Munich-based landscape artist Fritz Baer (1850-1919). At some point during the later 1890s, after bringing her technique as a water colour artist up to standard, she took an extended trip to Scotland where she was able to work on her landscape painting technique with the (at that time) much respected young water colour painter, Glasgow-born John Terris (1865-1914). During and after this developmental phase the pattern was set. Elster produced numerous etchings, lithographs and, most notably, water colours depicting landscapes, often showing the same scenes at different times of day. Back in Germany she made it her habit to work from her studio at Leopoldstra√üe 31 in Munich during the summers months, returning to Bremen during the winters. While in Bremen, and before heading south for the summer, she would spend the spring months as a member of the nearby D√∂tlingen Artists' Colony. She formed a particular friendship at with another Bremen artist, Marie Stumpe. Stumpe lived more or less permanently at the \\"D√∂tlingen Colony\\" while her husband, a businessman, generally stayed in Bremen during weekdays, spending weekends with Stumpe and her fellow artists. Elster and Stumpe often explored the artistic possibilities of the area together, seeking out \\"landscape motifs\\" to sketch. In 1904, during one of her summer stays in Bavaria, Elster became a member of the so-called Luitpold Group of artists which had been created a few years earlier by her mentor Fritz Baer to represent a younger generation of contemporary artists and strive to improve the quality of the artistic output being produced at that time.Wolf, G.J.: Ausstellung der ‚ÄûLuitpoldgruppe‚Äú im M√ºnchner Kunstverein, in: Die Kunst f√ºr alle 28, M√ºnchen 1913, p. 267. Later, between 1931 and 1937, Elster was supporting herself as an artist based at Richard-Wagner-Stra√üe 3 in Bremen. Elster died in Munich towards the end of 1948. Artistic approach Elster's work employs a bold and muscular technique. The use of colour and the appreciation of light and shading suggest an appreciation of John Constable's landscapes. Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der identified a level of audacity reminiscent of Constable's work (ein \\"Constable gemahnenden K√ºhnheit\\"). Elster's harbour paintings, in particular, show off her own very distinctive style, the sense of space frequently emphasized with an \\"empty\\" foreground which sometimes extends far into the heart of the picture, evoking associations with photography or with Japanese woodcut images. Some of these same influences can also be inferred in Elster's over-emphasizing of contours, using black outlines. She sheer graphic power is even more evident in her charcoal drawings. And there is a heightened tension created in the contrast between linear grids overlaying the motifs and the more impressionist \\"flood- lighting\\" effect with which it is combined. Other Elster paintings, such as \\"Der Sommertag\\" (\\"The Summer Day\\"), appear to owe more to Vincent van Gogh than to John Constable. Exhibitions Elster exhibited in the Munich \\"Glaspalast\\" as early as 1900. From 1904, as a member of the Luitpold Group, she participated almost every year in their exhibitions in cities such as Berlin, Munich, D√ºsseldorf, Hannover, Hamburg, and Bremerhaven. Her debut in Bremen came in 1922 thanks to the \\"North-West Germany Art Association\\" (\\"Nordwestdeutsche K√ºnstlerbund\\"). Two years later her exhibits took a major part of city's spectacular Kunsthalle exhibition: almost all of the 22 Elster paintings on display found buyers. The last significant exhibition in which Elster's works featured while she was still alive took place in 1941 and was arranged to mark her eightieth birthday at the \\"Print Room\\" (\\"Graphische Kabinett\\") in Bremen, where her work had already been included in exhibitions on a number of earlier occasions. However, it would be more than another fifty years before a collection of her work would be presented in an exhibition. That rediscovery took place thanks to an exhibition organised in 1992 by the Overbeck Foundation. In 2011 her work was celebrated again in an extensive exhibition arranged by the Arts Foundation at Lilienthal (Bremen). Press \\"They say Miss Elster is an old lady. If that is true, how is it possible that so much ability remained undiscovered for so long?\\" The newspaper report that opened with this question reflects the warm reception that Elster's work received at the 1924 Kunsthalle exhibition. It was perhaps no more than a reflection of the attitudes common in those times that another enthusiastic critic, after commending her paintings for their \\"well judged line\\", the frugal and clever \\"economy of her handiwork\\" and a talent that bore comparison with a \\"thoroughly male artistry and balance\\". went on to compare her (favourably) only with three female artists: Paula Modersohn-Becker, Anna Plate and Clara Rilke-Westhoff. Legacy Most of Toni Elster's work, which includes various large format canvas print, is today in private hands, and not readily accessible to scholars or critics. But some of pictures have found their way into the Bremen Kunsthalle collection, the \\"Print Room\\" (\\"Graphische Kabinett\\") and the Focke Museum (both also in Bremen). Further afield the State Museum for Art and Cultural History in Oldenburg holds and normally has on display two characteristic Elster paintings: \\"Kutter im Hafen\\" and \\"Moorlandschaft (Schneeschmelze)\\" (\\"Cutters in harbour\\" and \\"Moorland landscape under melting snow\\"). These both demonstrate her talent. One commentator, enthusiastically commending both paintings, added that they were typical of her work both in terms of composition and of subject matter. He nevertheless thought it nothing short of astonishing that she had discovered the harbours as a recurring theme. At that time a woman of Elster's social background would not normally be expected to turn up unchaperoned with an easel in the Bremen harbour district. But Elster's interest in the many aspects of the maritime scene more than outweighed any conventional scruples. The various artistic testimonies that she created of her wanderings among the warehouses, sheds and cargo ship form a portfolio of swiftly completed and confidently contoured charcoal drawings that express Elster's artistic temperament with stark clarity. She commanded a formidable level of graphic craftsmanship which then found its way into her paintings when she returned to her studio, and added in her own unique impressionistic flavour.Rudolf Alexander Schr√∂der quoted by Inge Jacob in: Hermine Oberbeck-Rohte und Bremer Malerinnen um 1900, published by the Fritz and Hermine Overbeck Foundation.

Early life and education According to Sese himself, he decided to pursue a career related to space science as early as when he was five years old. His mother was biological sciences professor at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB) taught him in biology such as on how to splice a DNA but did not find sufficient interest in the field. He attended University of the Philippines Rural High School. Sese having developed interest in physics while in high school pursued a degree in applied physics at the UPLB which he believed to be the closest to an astrophysics degree since he was not able to find a university which offers such degree at that time and decided to specialize in instrumentation development and design. He attained his master's degree at the Diliman campus of the same university. He pursued a doctorate degree in physics at the University of Tsukuba in Japan and took computational astrophysics as his specialization. He attained his doctorate degree in 2009 and moved back to the Philippines in 2011. Career After graduating from the University of the Philippines Diliman, Sese worked at the Los Ba√±os campus as an instructor. He briefly stopped teaching to pursue a doctorate degree in Japan. As one of the only three astrophysicists in the Philippines as of 2017, Sese joined the Department of Science and Technology and served as the head of the National Space Development Program which was launched in order to set up the foundation of a future space agency. He also set up his own firm, Regulus SpaceTech Inc. which is involved in space research and development, education and consultancy. He also promoted the teaching of space education in high schools and elementary schools through the Philippine Space Science Education Program (PSSEP) which also led to more universities in the Philippines to offer degrees in aerospace engineering and also lobbied for legislation related to space science. He contributed to the writing of the proposed legislation \\"Act Establishing the Philippine Space Development and Utilization Policy and Creating the Philippine Space Agency\\" which aims to establish a national space agency. Sese along with 7 other Filipino scientists were included in Asian Scientist 100 (AS100) list released in March 2018 which recognizes the contribution of individuals in Asia in the field of science and technology.

The church was founded by Glen Yoshioka in 2009 and ordains and trains people to officiate at weddings. The church is a secular non- denominational organization that does not promote any specific religious ideologies, instead allowing its ministers to define their own practice and faith. This allows ceremonies to be tailored to the beliefs of the couple. The church ordained Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen in 2017. The church had operated entirely online until June 2019, when its ministers began performing in-person ordinations in response to Tennessee passing a law disallowing ministers ordained online from solemnizing weddings in the state. According to Executive Director Lewis King, by June 2017 the church has ordained more than 715,000 people in the United States, including over 13,400 active ministers in Tennessee. The church performed mass ordinations in a number of cities in Tennessee, with the majority of attendees being those who had already been ordained online but need to update their status to comply with the new law.  Officiant Training and State Registration  American Marriage Ministries offers online training tools and guidance available for free for ministers. AMM's Legal Requirements library is a database where ministers can look up state or county requirements. The organization also provides city-specific instructions on how to get ordained and perform marriage. For example, New York City is one of the stricter locations and requires wedding officiants to appear in person at the city clerk‚Äôs office to register (the city also charges a $15 fee.) Virginia is the most troublesome state, denying most ministers who get ordained online, but A.M.M. has information on combating that on its website as well.  Charitable Activities  American Marriage Ministries is active in two major areas of civic life -- supporting charities that share its values and beliefs, and defending marriage equality in states where lawmakers attempt to restrict who may or may not perform marriage. AMM has made donations of $500 or more to over 100 Non-Profit Charities across the country. Regarding marriage equality and freedom of religion, AMM is active in New York, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.  Partnerships And Public Practices  American Marriage Ministries is active in the marriage equality and environmental preservation spaces. In 2018, American Marriage Ministries and the International Association of Professional Wedding Officiants (IAPWO) agreed to work together to educate first-time wedding officiants on how to perform wedding ceremonies, and to raise public awareness about the important role that professional wedding officiants play in the special events industry. American Marriage Ministries also partners with Carbon Fund to offset its carbon footprint and promote sustainable practices, especially in the wedding industry. American Marriage Ministries is not affiliated in any way with any other online churches such as the Universal Life Church (ULC) or any brick- and-mortar churches elsewhere in the country.

He also researches idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia and clinical trials of antifungal agents. Bennett and Peter Richard Williamson are studying previously healthy patients with cryptococcal meningitis to discover underlying predisposing factors and improve therapy. Despite the absence of immunosuppression, these patients are surprisingly difficult to treat compared to those with AIDS and cryptococcosis. A major cause of morbidity and death is cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, which usually coexist. The goals in studying these patients include: understanding the mechanisms causing cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, searching for genetic markers in the patients and their families that might have predisposed patients to cryptococcosis, assessing the role of corticosteroids in controlling cerebral edema, and evaluating potential new treatments for cryptococcosis.  Awards and honors  Bennett's honors include master in the American College of Physicians; charter president of the Greater Washington Infectious Diseases Society; member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the American Association of Physicians.

In 1933 she began organizing unofficial scout groups, which were recognized in 1942, and eventually desegregated. She was honored by Girl Scouts of the USA with the naming of Camp Holloway in 1955, and with the \\"Hidden Heroine\\" award in 1976. Early life and education Josephine Amanda Groves was born on March 10, 1898, in Cowpens, South Carolina. She was the seventh of ten children. Her parents were Emma Gray Groves and John Wesley Groves, a Methodist minister. She attended Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating in June 1923 with an A. B. Degree (a bachelor's). In 1926, Holloway obtained a second bachelor's degree at the Tennessee Agricultural & Industrial State College (now Tennessee State University). Scouting career After she graduated from Fisk University, Holloway began working in scouting for girls in 1923 at the Bethlehem Center, a social settlement house home to at-risk women and girls. Upon marrying, however, she ceased working at the Bethlehem Center, as she was forced to resign by the director who claimed that a married woman would not have time to fulfill her work obligations. When her eldest daughter turned six in 1933, Holloway petitioned the Nashville Girl Scout Council to create a new, segregated troop for African-American girls. They declined her request, saying that maintaining separate facilities would cost too much. Holloway went ahead and started her own unofficial troop, and encouraged her friends to do the same. By 1942, the number of African-American Girl Scout troops caused the Nashville Council to officially recognize them. In 1944, Holloway was hired by the Council to be a field advisor for the organization. In 1951, the Council began integrating black and white troops, a process that was completed in 1962 when they ceased maintaining a separate \\"Negro district\\". Holloway did not view the end of segregation as necessarily positive, however, stating that it reduced black girls' exposure to \\"examples of black strength and pride\\". In 1963, Holloway retired from scouting. Personal life She married Guerney Holloway, a coworker from the Bethlehem Center on June 30, 1925 and had three daughters: Nareda Wenefred, Josephine Alzilee, and Weslia Juanita. Death Holloway died on December 7, 1988, at age ninety. Honors and distinctions In 1951, land was purchased by the Girl Scouts so that African-American girls would have a place to go to summer camp, as many state parks denied entrance to African Americans. In 1955, Camp Holloway was opened; as of 2016, it is still operational and open to all girl scouts. Holloway was the first African- American employed by the Girl Scouts in Middle Tennessee. In the 1976 celebration of the US bicentennial, she was given the \\"Hidden Heroine\\" award. In 1991, the Girl Scout headquarters opened the Josephine G. Holloway Historical Collection and Gallery.

Launched by both, Jalil Labadi and his father Dr. Abdel Aziz Labadi, in 2008 in Amman, Jordan, the platform aims at presenting reliable, up-to-date and simplified medical information to users in the region in Arabic, according to their proclaimed mission. Today, the website features thousands of medical articles, a medical glossary, a section that is dedicated to questions and answers, the latest news in medicine, telehealth services and consultations and a lot more. AlTibbi has also partnered with Mawdoo3, a leading online Arabic content provider, to provide high quality content to a growing audience in the region.  Background  Upon his return from Germany in 2004, Dr. Abdel Aziz Labadi launched the ‚ÄúMedical Glossary‚Äù in Arabic, creating a pioneering medical reference for Arabic-speakers. In 2008, Jalil Labadi sought to build on his father's glossary, and create a more comprehensive platform, targeting all Arabic-speakers in the MENA region who were, according to his observations, in need of reliable information in their mother-tongue. Ever since its inception in 2008 in Amman, Jordan, Altibbi has expanded and become one of the leading health platforms in the region: * In 2010, the medical glossary was further developed and turned into a multi- service medical website, with the aim of reaching as many users as possible. * In 2012, the website received text questions from patients and provided answers from specialized doctors for free. * In 2016, remote consultation services were activated, and users could, for the first time, contact doctors at any place and time via. * In 2019, the platform enabled doctors to activate the e-clinic, a patient management system where they could manage patients‚Äô files, appointments booking and electronic health records online and launched services globally.  Funding  When it was first launched in 2008, the founder relied on self-funding, and the financial support of friends and relatives. The website received its first investment in 2015 from Middle East Venture Partners and DASH ventures. With this investment, Altibbi was able to enhance interaction between doctors and users, and draw a larger number of doctors and users from five Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon. In 2018, Altibbi received a new round of funding, with a total of US$6.5 million from Middle East Venture Partners, DASH Ventures, TAMM, RIMCO Investments, Endeavor's Catalyst Fund, and other investors. This investment is expected to help the platform further develop its integrated health solutions, access new markets and enrich medical content in Arabic.  Services  Altibbi offers users in the MENA region a wide range of medical services including: * Access to medical articles, written in a simple language to raise awareness among a non-expert audience. * Access to daily news and updates. * Access to the ‚ÄúEncyclopedia of Medicines‚Äù, a comprehensive reference featuring all medicines that are available in the MENA market. * Access to the ‚ÄúMedical Glossary‚Äù, which explains to non-experts medical terms in a simplified language. * Access to medical laboratories. * Access to the ‚ÄúQuestion and Answer‚Äù section, which enables users to send their questions and receive answers from specialized doctors for free. * Access to informative videos on a wide range of health issues. * Access to the directory of medical care providers in the MENA region. * Consultation services, enabling patients to reach a doctor around the clock in all countries for a fee, which can be paid using different payment methods. * Access to e-clinics, a system that enables doctors to handle their patients‚Äô files online through the platform.  Statistics  Altibbi brings together more than 12 thousand accredited medical doctors from all specializations and different Arab countries. Thanks to their availability on the platform, users can get a remote medical diagnosis (if possible) and facilitate the provision of healthcare services for users around the clock. In 2017, more than 50 thousand users were registered for phone consultation service with medical doctors. In addition, more than 10 million people visited the website on a monthly basis.  Awards  In recognition of its efforts as one of the leading creators of medical content in Arabic, Altibbi was awarded the first prize in health category by the Arab E-Content Award in Bahrain in 2013. The award, which falls under the United Nations‚Äô World Global Summit (WGS), reportedly came after presenting high-quality digital content in Arabic for years.

Weiss identifies the main strains of antisemitism as left-wing antisemitism, right-wing antisemitism, and Islamic antisemitism, and tries to provide a history of each variety. Weiss said that the book will discuss the \\"alarming rise of antisemitism in (the United States) and in Europe,\\" and will propose ways to address the problem. She describes her role in the Columbia Unbecoming controversy, which she writes gave her \\"a front row seat to leftist anti-Semitism\\" at the university. Reception Talia Lavin of The Nation notes that Weiss presents a rather anti-intellectual argument in her exploration of antisemitism. Lavin argues that Weiss presents simplistic caricatures of both the left and the right, and that the presentation of Muslim antisemitism uses a veil of plausible deniability to suggest exclusion of Muslim groups from Europe. Lavin concludes her review by stating that the \\"profound lack of intellectual curiosity, proportionality, and material analysis in the book renders it worse than simply useless.\\" In Jordan Weissmann's review for Slate, he presents a sharp critique of Weiss's book. Weissmann highlights as his central critique a false equivalency between antisemitism on the right and on the left. He argues that by reaching towards genocide as the endpoint of left-wing antisemitism, Weiss far overstates her case. In addition, Weissman argues that Weiss often fails to present a complete picture of events and people, that Weiss never explores evangelical antisemitism, and that Weiss presents an oversimplified view of how antisemitic radicalization occurs. Melissa Braustein of The Federalist describes the book as broadly compelling. She lauds the book's critiques of the left, though she argues that Weiss fails to provide examples to support the claim that President Trump is antisemitic.

Aside from the two bombers, the blasts killed six others; three soldiers and three civilians. 14 other soldiers were left injured. Perpetrators One of the perpetrators of the bombings was a 23 year old Filipino militant who was a member of an Abu Sayyaf faction led by Hajan Sawadjaan. The individual was identified as a first case of a Filipino national carrying a suicide attack in the country which is a cause of concern by authorities. The Filipino militant was the one responsible for the first explosion at the military camp's gate. The other bomber was characterized as a person with Caucasian features and of Moroccan descent. The identity of the second bomber was a presumption by the military from visual assessment of troops and the viewing of old videos of two Moroccan boys under the custody of Sawadjaan after their father detonated himself in the 2018 Lamitan bombing. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant also claimed credit for the bombings. Reactions =Domestic= President Rodrigo Duterte conferred posthumous recognition to the three soldier casualties. The soldiers who died as a result of the attack were awarded the Order of Lapu-Lapu, Rank of Kalasag. He also paid a visit to 14 soldiers injured from the attack. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana voiced concern regarding the frequency of suicide bombings in the country after the Indanan bombings followed the 2018 Lamitan and January 2019 Jolo Cathedral bombings which were believed to be suicide attacks. Personnel of the Army 1st Brigade Combat Team stationed elsewhere were deployed in Sulu to boost security efforts in the area. =Security analysts= Some security analysts from outside the Philippines noted of the attack. Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington described the Indanan bombings as an escalation but added that it is also a \\"sign of increased radicalization\\" while Sidney Jones said the incident brought a \\"lethal new ideology\\" in the country. Jones described that the influence of the noted that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's influence in the Philippines \\"remains strong\\" citing the recent suicide bombings in the country and recent propaganda videos of the group. But Dr. Rommel C. Banlaoi, Chairman of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research (PIPVTR) and former Professor of Political Science at the National Defense College of the Philippines, argues that a suicide bombing involving a Filipino is no longer surprising as the Tausugs in Mindanao have the long history of suicide attacks during the Spanish and American colonial occupations. Dr. Banlaoi also warns that the successive incidents of suicide bombings in the country are indications that suicide terrorism is the newest face of threat in the Philippines and everybody should do their part to counter it. As early as 2006, Dr. Banlaoi was already warning about the possibility of suicide terrorism in the Philippines involving a Filipino.

Miller is colloquially associated with a group of U.S. military personnel convicted of war crimes known as the Leavenworth 10. After being incarcerated for eight years, Miller was granted parole and was released in 2019. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Justice for Warriors Caucus and Military Adviser to Texas Republican U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert. Early life Miller's parents are his mother Rene√© Myers, and his step-father Craig Myers. He was raised in Frederick, Maryland, attended Frederick High School, and later lived in Hagerstown, Maryland. He was a security guard at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Miller has two daughters, who live in Maryland. Military career Miller is a former Maryland Army National Guard Sergeant.Joshua Hersh (May 29, 2019). \\"Meet the Man Pushing the Trump Administration to Pardon Combat Veterans,\\" Vice. He joined the National Guard in 2006, volunteered for three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, and had top performance reviews. His wife said he was given Army Commendation Medals and Army Achievement Medals for his military service. =Shooting= On his third tour of duty, for which he had volunteered, Miller was assigned to a Connecticut National Guard unit, and attached to the US Army's 101st Airborne Division. Miller was on a combat mission in a Taliban-controlled area in Masamute Bala, in Laghman Province, in north-eastern Afghanistan on September 26, 2010. He was warned that day that his unit‚Äôs base had been penetrated. An Afghan man suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation. Miller said that during the battlefield interrogation the suspect, who he believed was an insurgent, tried to grab his 9 mm Beretta handgun, and that he shot the man in self-defense. The military later identified the man as Atta Mohammed. Miller's lawyer told the jury that Miller stopped the man for questioning when the man walked through a defensive perimeter that Miller's unit had set up around a mortar unit, infiltrating the base. He said that upon being questioned the man made inconsistent statements, Miller believed the man could be a threat to Miller's unit who was scouting the area for the Taliban, that during questioning the man tried to grab Miller's weapon, and that during the ensuing struggle Miller shot and killed the man. A platoon sergeant testified that as a result of the interrogation of the suspect the unit came to believe that a Taliban attack was imminent and heightened its security, and that within an hour the unit was in fact attacked, with the sergeant crediting Miller‚Äôs interrogation of the man with saving the lives of American soldiers, his lawyer said. A witness Guardsman from Maryland testified that he heard Miller threaten to kill the man if he did not tell the truth, and that he then straddled the man, who was lying on his back, before shooting him in the head. Matt Calarco, a prosecuting lawyer, said during closing arguments: \\"Immediately following the event the accused said, 'I shot him. He was a liar.'\\" =Court martial= Miller was tried in a court martial trial. After under three hours of deliberation, a 10-member jury of military members at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, convicted him in July 2011 when he was 27 years old, finding him guilty of premeditated murder of a civilian. He was sentenced to life in prison. Miller was incarcerated at the Fort Leavenworth military Disciplinary Barracks, beginning in July 2011. =Sentence reduction and parole= In June 2017 Texas Republican U.S. Representative Brian Babin asked President Donald Trump in a letter to order a review of Miller's case and the cases of other veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq who were imprisoned for battlefield crimes. Miller also received support from Maryland Democratic US Representative Elijah Cummings.Jasmine Pelaez (March 22, 2019). \\"National Guardsman released on parole after serving eight years in military prison,\\" Local DVM News. In April 2018 Texas Republican U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert testified at a hearing, supporting Miller.

Research =Detection of breast cancer= In the early 1980s, Rosenberg‚Äôs early clinical research efforts were focused on validating the use of mammographic location of non-palpable breast lesions. Previously, there was no directed biopsy method for these abnormalities. These studies allowed histologic and radiographic findings to be correlated, and this laid the foundation for the development of the BIRADS classification for mammographic findings.\\"Early Detection of Breast Cancer\\" Recent Results in Cancer Research 90:125-32, 1984.\\"Staging and treatment of clinically occult breast cancer\\" Cancer 53: 1379-84, 1984\\"Clinically occult breast lesions: localization and significance\\" Radiology 162: 167-70, 1987. Rosenberg, along with ultrasonographers, developed techniques for pre- and intraoperative ultrasound lesion localization with post excision evaluation of the tumor bed for confirmation of excision. These techniques were nearly 100% accurate with adequate lesion removal.\\"Hand‚Äêheld and automated sonomammography.

They also reported on the experience with lumpectomy, level 1 axillary node dissection followed by breast radiation (breast conservation) for the treatment of operable breast cancer (stage 1 and 2 disease). This work validated the effectiveness of breast conservation as an equivalent to mastectomy with regard to distant disease and local control and substantiated the need for radiation therapy and complete excision of the primary and established the acceptance of breast conservation therapy for breast cancer.\\"Lumpectomy and Level I Axillary Dissection Prior to irradiation for ‚ÄúOperable‚Äù Breast Cancer\\" Annals of Surgery 200: 554-60, 1984.\\"Extent of axillary dissection preceding irradiation for carcinoma of the breast\\" Archives of Surgery 121:1395-98, 1986. Elderly women with breast cancer were reviewed and, although it was standard of care to perform mastectomy, Rosenberg‚Äôs work, along with others at Jefferson University Hospital, confirmed that elderly women could be effectively treated with breast conservation and should be offered all surgical options, as the new standard of care.Geriatrics 48: Supplement 1: 9-13, 1993 June.\\"Role of immediate reconstruction for elderly breast cancer patients\\" Jefferson Digital Commons. 2007. Introduction of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy also changes the standard of care for a more advanced stage, but localized breast cancers as 80% of women had a response to chemotherapy. The studies helped establish the length of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy needed and the increase in survival and disease-free survival when compared to women who did not receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-free survival improved three to four-fold and neo- adjuvant became the standard of care for a patient with larger tumors and nodal disease but no distant metastases. In collaboration with Carl Mansfield, she reported on ten-year experience with interstitial implants in the breast to deliver the boost dose. This work changed the delivery of breast radiation by showing the complications from excessive boost radiation and also the reduced tumor recurrence when radiation was used. Interstitial implants were effective as method to deliver boost\\"Ten-year results in 1070 patients with stages I and II breast cancer treated by conservative surgery and radiation therapy\\" Cancer 75(9):2328-36, 1995. and offered an abbreviated time frame to do so.\\"Perioperative implantation of iridium-192 as the boost technique for stage I and II breast cancer: results of a 10-year study of 655 patients\\" Radiology 192: 33-36, 1994.

In 2006, Rosenberg reported on and discussed the management of women with a history of breast augmentation who developed breast cancer. The conclusions were that treatment was to be individualized based upon the breast size and tumor location but both breast conservation and mastectomy were associated with similar survival, disease- free interval, and local recurrence. Breast conservation was a viable option to be offered to these women.The Breast Journal, 2006 July-Aug 12(4):343-8. \\"Breast Conservation for the Treatment of Breast Cancer in the Previously Augmented Patient\\". 32nd Annual Symposium of the American Society of Breast Disease, San Diego, California, April 10‚Äì12, 2008.

Evaluation of this tissue led to several observations that were important in understanding the biological behavior of malignancies.

Collaborations with Croce were focused on microRNA expression and allowed the patterns of expression to be identified for target genes for tumors and by profiling the expression. These reproducible patterns of microRNA expression allowed for target tumor gene profiling, including male breast cancer.\\"MicroRNA gene expression deregulation in human breast cancer\\" Cancer Research Journal.

In collaboration with Hallguir Rui, they were the first to isolate a prolactin receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, and to identify this molecule as Janus kinase-2. These human tissue lines in a prolactin deficient mouse model allowed the definition of signal transduction by cytokine receptors and hormones with a primary goal of understanding the role of downstream Jak-Stat pathways and their aberrations in breast cancer. Together, they also demonstrated that the loss of Stat5 in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer is associated with increased risk of antiestrogen resistance and laid the groundwork for the patented matrix assembly technology for generation of high-density tumor tissue arrays for high-through-put molecular profiling.\\"Prolactin Inhibits BCL6 Expression in Breast Cancer through a Stat5a-Dependent Mechanism\\" Cancer Research Journal.

It deals with an unhappy marriage and its dissolution. The play reworks George Wilkin's play The Miseries of Enforced Marriage (1607), itself based on the life of Walter Calverley, who stabbed his wife and killed his children. In Behn's play the unhappy couple manage to dissolve their marriage and seek happiness with other partners.  Plot  Bellmour is in love with Celinda, and they are secretly betrothed. However, Celinda's parents intend her to marry Sir Timothy Tawdrey, a fop. Lord Plotwell, who is Bellmour's uncle and guardian, forces him to marry Diana. Bellmour refuses to consummate his marriage to Diana, and tells her that he cannot love her. An angry Diana tries to seduce Celinda (whilst Celinda is in male disguise). She then turns her attention to Friendlove (Celinda's brother), who agrees to kill Bellmour for her. A despairing Bellmour falls into debauchery, and visits a bagnio with Tawdrey. They meet Betty Flauntit (Tawdrey's mistress) and other women there. Lord Plotwell receives a letter from Diana begging for her marriage to be annulled. Diana and Bellmour's marriage is dissolved, and Plotwell reconciles with Bellmour (who has now reformed). Diana agrees to marry Friendlove, and Bellmour is now free to marry Celinda. In a subplot, Tawdrey plots to revenge himself upon Bellmour by using a mock marriage to trick his sister (Phillis) into having sex with him. However, their 'fake' marriage ceremony in fact turns out to be fully legal.  Reception  When reviewing Behn's life and works, one writer stated that 'in all her [Behn's] comedies we can remember but one true, honest lover, Belmour, in \\"The Town Fop\\"'. Montague Summers felt that The Town Fop showed 'in a marked degree her intimate knowledge of the earlier dramatists'.

In 1935, she founded Denmark's first badminton club, Aarhus Badmintonklub. Ten years later, she was a co-founder of Red Barnet, the Danish branch of Save the Children. From 1965 to 1974, she was director of Jydsk B√∏rnehave-Seminarium, a teacher-training establishment for kindergarten teachers. Early life and education Born in Copenhagen on 11 January 1911, Alfa Tofft was the daughter of the composer Alfred Tofft (1835‚Äì1931) and the singer Elna Bergmann (1875‚Äì1933). When she was three years old, her mother went to sing in America but never returned. Alfa and her twin sister Beta were brought up by their father. After attending the Copenhagen Business College, she worked for the music copyright association KODA which was chaired by her father. When she was 21, she went to Canada to study languages at the University of Montreal where she also developed her skills in badminton. Professional life On returning to Denmark, she used her inheritance to build √Örhus Badmintonhal for the Aarhus Badminton Club which she founded in 1935. In so doing, she was the first to bring badminton to Jutland. She ran the club until 1939 when the premises were taken over by the German occupiers. Driven into bankruptcy, she worked for Aarhus Municipality until the end of World War II. Immediately afterwards, she founded Red Barnet, the Danish branch of Save the Children, which in collaboration with the women's support organization Danske Kvinders Beredskab brought thousands of abandoned children to Denmark from the war-swept countries of Europe. Over 5,000 were rehoused in the Aarhus area. From 1949 to 1951, Tofft was encouraged by Red Barnet to train as a kindergarten teacher as there were plans for her to run a kindergarten in Aarhus. As she was involved in setting up three kindergartens in Copenhagen and Aarhus, her training at the Jydsk B√∏rnehave-Seminarium was not completed until 1954 when she was employed there as a kindergarten teacher. In 1965, she was appointed rector, heading the institution until her retirement in 1974. Tofft is remembered for contributing to the paedagogical side of kindergarten teaching, emphasizing the children's growth and development rather than simply caring for them. At the time, she did not receive much support for her ideas although they were appreciated by her colleagues and students. She was also successful in educating students from Greenland. Alfa Tofft died in Aarhus on 29 July 2004. Awards In 1948, Tofft was awarded the French Medal of French Gratitude and in 1951 the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity.

Shoreditch High St Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. was a department store in Shoreditch High Street, London, described during the early years as \\"Wholesale and Retail Drapers and General Warehousemen\\". The business evolved from a small drapery shop in the 1840s and grew to employ over 500 people. In what appears to have been an altruistic gesture, the founder of the business, Jeremiah Rotherham (1806‚Äì1878), created a partnership with four of his long term employees. After his death they became the owners and sold the company via a stock market flotation in 1898. At this time the store was located at 81‚Äì91 Shoreditch High Street and 17‚Äì35 Boundary Street. Further expansion included the acquisition in 1935 of the London Theatre (formerly the Shoreditch Empire), 95‚Äì99 Shoreditch High Street, for use as warehouse space. During World War II the main store was hit by bombs during the London blitz; the company was able carry on trading by transferring to an adjacent building. In 1968 Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. was purchased by Spencer, Turner and Boldero, later becoming part of the Dent Fownes/Dewhurst Dent P.L.C. group. Jeremiah Rotherham ‚Äì founder The founder of the store, Jeremiah Rotherham, was born in Whitwell, Derbyshire, England. He began his career as a haberdasher with his older brother, William Rotherham, who ran a linen drapers, haberdashers, silk mercers and furriers business at 39-41 Shoreditch High Street with John Hill Grinsell. In 1832 the partnership between William Rotherham and Grinsell ceased In 1835 William was declared bankrupt and on 1 February 1836 he was placed on trial at the Old Bailey for \\"Deception: bankruptcy: having been declared a bankrupt, feloniously did conceal part of his personal estate\\". He was found not guilty. The transcript of the trail provides insights into the size of his business operation and to the fact that another brother, Joseph (1810‚Äì1849), was working with him. By 1834 Jeremiah Rotherham had moved to a linen draper shop run by James Burrough (1764‚Äì1844), at 84 Shoreditch High Street. Burrough had two sons working for him, James (1795‚Äìc1844) and Joseph (1797‚Äì1826) who in 1824 had married Sophia Shingles (1794‚Äì1849) from Norfolk. They had one child before he died 1826. In 1834 the widowed Sophia married Jeremiah Rotherham: she was 40 and he was 28 years old. When Burrough died in 1844, Rotherham took over the lease of his shop, where both he and Sophia worked and lived. Sophia's sister, Mary Ann Shingles (1810‚Äì1849), lived with them, but in 1849, during the cholera epidemic that struck the East End in that year, Sophia died in August, followed within a month by Mary Ann. They were both buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in Rotherham's family vault. Jeremiah's brother, Joseph Rotherham, who lived in Stepney, also died in the same year. Another sister, Elizabeth Shingles (1788‚Äì1877), married the Norfolk schoolmaster George Boardman (1793‚Äì1876). One of their daughters, Marian Boardman (1824‚Äì1903), appears to have become a companion to Rotherham after his wife's death. She later married Rev. Frederic Halliley Stammers (1833‚Äì1902). She and her brother, Rev. Edward Hubbard Boardman (1826‚Äì1912), became major beneficiaries of Rotherham's will, inheriting his share of the business interests when he died in 1878. Business partnerships Part of department store, Boundary St From about 1854 Jeremiah Rotherham took on business partners to help him run the store. The first was London-born fellow draper, George John Frederick Goodrich (1818‚Äì1885). He retired in 1875 for reasons of ill-health, by which time the store had expanded and included 81‚Äì87 Shoreditch High Street plus a new warehouse in Boundary Street. The other partner at this time was Devon born draper, Robert Shapland (1826‚Äì1864). He helped to expand the wholesale side of the business, selling extensively to the millinery trade. Rotherham seemed genuinely fond of Shapland and his family; he was a witness at their wedding and the Shaplands named their third child Edgar Rotherham Shapman.Partnership ended 1865 The next partnership was set up with four employees who had worked their way up in the company. They were Frederick Snowden, George Gotelee, Robert Dummett and William Ellis. Snowden (1844-1932) from Shoreditch, had started with the store in 1856 as an apprentice and later became Jeremiah Rotherham's private secretary. Gotelee (1840‚Äì1918), draper from Buckinghamshire, also started as a trainee at Rotherham's and later became a buyer. Ellis (1841‚Äì1924) was from Devon and described in the 1861 census as draper's assistant, later becoming a buyer. Dummett (1843‚Äì1907), also from Devon, began his career at Rotherham's in the dispatch department, eventually becoming the correspondence clerk and warehouse manager. Barrier Miner, Sat 21 Dec 1895, Page 6, THE WAY TO SUCCESS ‚Äì The Rotherhams of Shoreditch Death of Jeremiah Rotherham Rotherham died on 30 August 1878 in his Anlaby Houses, Upper Clapton, Hackney. His personal estate was valued in probate as under ¬£350,000 (rough value today would be ¬£41 million). He died childless and left the biggest part of his estate to his niece Marian (Boardman) Stammers (1824‚Äì1903) and nephew Rev. Edward Hubbard Boardman (1826‚Äì1912) in equal parts. Before his death, Rotherham had set up a partnership with Snowden, Gotelee, Dummett and Ellis. The instruction in his will was for his share of this partnership to become the property of his niece and nephew. They were at liberty to continue with the business or sell their interest, but he instructed that any sale must first be offered to Frederick Snowden. Rotherham made several other bequests in his will to charities and employees. He also instructed his executors to provide for the continuation of a trust fund for the family of his former partner, Robert Shapland. Rotherham was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green Cemetery. =Anlaby= Jeremiah Rotherham had lived in Anlaby Houses, Upper Clapton for about 18 years. The house was one of a pair and leased by Rotherham. The other one of the pair was occupied by the Hubbard family who owned the freehold. The name Anlaby was later used by the company for a line of hosiery and for its 27‚Äì39 Boundary Street building, which has now been converted to a block of flats.Anlaby House, 27‚Äì39 Boundary Street, London E2 Heritage Statement, Revision A. 3 November 2010 Delta Architects page 9 In his book Cracked Eggs and Chicken Soup: A Memoir of Growing Up Between The Wars, the author Norman Jacobs says that the use of the Anlaby name in the Rotherham business came about because they originally came from the Yorkshire town of that name. Sale of store In 1898 the four partners put the store up for sale for ¬£500,000 via a stock market flotation. They agreed to stay on as directors to ensure a continuity of business arrangements and to liaise with stakeholders. At the time of Rotherham's death, several of the buildings in Shoreditch High Street appear to have been leased,Ralph Fordham's properties in Shoreditch, Hackney Archives however by the time of the sale the company's property portfolio was said to be mostly freehold, including the main store in Shoreditch High Street, numbers 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 and 91, plus the building to the rear in Boundary Street, numbers 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 31, 33 and 35. There is no mention in the prospectus of Rotherham's niece and nephew being involved in the sale of the store, so it appears that their interest in the business had been sold to the partners. Similar stock market flotation of privately owned department stores at this time included Harrods in 1889, William Whiteley (Universal Provider) in 1899 and D. H. Evans & Co in 1894. These stores were able to raise funding on the stock market for expansion and to purchase other smaller stores, for example Harrods purchased Dickins & Jones in 1914. The application for shares in Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. was heavily oversubscribed and about two years later a further sale of debenture and ordinary shares was offered. The dividend paid to shareholders for many years was between five and seven percent. The 600-page illustrated catalogue and general price list of 1904 details the variety of stock they carried in the store. There was also a mail order service on offer.

The most remarkable of them for long service was probably the chairman, Frederick Snowden, who retired on health grounds in 1926, having worked at the Rotherham store for 71 years.[\\"Jeremiah Rotherham And Co.\\" Times, 24 Feb. 1927, p. 20.

In his obituary it was said that he had left Devon at the age of 18 and travelled to London, without capital, without friends and without influence. He started at Rotherham's as an assistant in the despatch department and worked his way up to become head of the department. He died on 21 November 1907, and his probate indicates that he left ¬£71,480, roughly equivalent to ¬£8million today. His children included barrister, Sir Robert Ernest Dummett (1873‚Äì1941), who became chief magistrate, and George Herbert Dummett (1880‚Äì1969), silk/rayon merchant, whose son was philosopher Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett. George Gotelee died 18 September 1918 aged 78, having served with Rotherham‚Äôs for 62 years. His probate was recorded as ¬£117,264. He was replaced on the board by Snowden's son, Frederick Sydney Snowden, who remained as a director until 1958. Gotelee's son, Sydney Treble Gotelee (1878-1959), later became a director, a position he retained until he retired in 1958.New Board for Jeremiah Rotherham The Guardian London 24 Sep 1958, Page 10 William Ellis died aged 84 on the 11 March 1924 at his home in Reigate, Surrey leaving ¬£178,616.

His family were the tailors, Dor√© and Sons, who had several shops in the City of London.Frank Ernest Dore stockbroker When Jeremiah Rotherham died in 1878 he left his share of the business in equal measures to his niece, Marian (Boardman) Stammers, and nephew Rev. Edward Hubbard Boardman. They were at liberty to either continue as partners or to sell their interest to Frederick Snowden, and it appears they took the latter option. They were the children of Elizabeth Shingles (1788-1877) and George Boardman (1793-1876), who was a head teacher in Acle, Norfolk. After the death of Rotherham, the Rev Boardman, who was vicar of Grazeley, near Reading, resigned the living and moved to a large house called Glen Andred in Groombridge, East Sussex. He paid ¬£7,200 for the house, which had formerly been the home of artist Edward William Cooke, and lived there with his wife in partial retirement until his death in 1912.GLEN ANDRED: A GRADE II* GARDEN Sussex Gardens Trust In his will he left ¬£147,122 (rough equivalent today ¬£17 million), with many large bequests to hospitals and charities.The Times London, Greater London, England 25 May 1912, Sat Page 11Kent & Sussex Courier - Friday 03 May 1912, Rev.

The Stammers did not have children, but Rev. Stammers, who was a widower, had two children from his previous marriage and they were remembered by Rotherham with a legacy in his will. The Rev. Stammers' mother was Martha Halliley, from Dewsbury, Yorkshire. Her brother-in-law was Vicar John Buckworth of Dewsbury who had appointed Patrick Bront√´ as his curate in 1809. New management After Frederick Snowden left the business in 1926, a new chairman was appointed. He was Joseph Hockley (1873-1954) who had trained as a draper and joined Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. in about 1894. He had been company secretary before becoming chairman, a position that he retained until his death in 1954, serving 60 years with the business. His tenure covered the difficult trading periods of the economic depression in the 1930s and the Second World War. London Music Hall In 1933/34 the company purchased a theatre on an adjacent site located at 95‚Äì99 Shoreditch High Street. This was demolished to make way for a new warehouse.

Page 9 Final years By 1958 the financial position of the business was such that there was a call for the company to go into liquidation. In previous years, the policy had been to always appoint directors who had been employees of Jeremiah Rotherham & Co. However, to save the business a compromise was agreed and Nadji Khazam (1910‚Äì1984), an outsider from the Anglo-African Finance group, was appointed as a director.\\"More competition from U.S. banks in Europe.\\" Dual Coupon Convertabe. Times, 22 Feb. 1967, p. 13. The Times Digital Archive, . Accessed 29 June 2019. Khazam was originally from Iraq, and naturalised in Britain in about 1947. He had worked in the textile industry for several years and during this time, he and his family had acquired controlling interest in several weaving companies belonging to Haighton Holdings. In 1951 he and his sister, Flora Yentob, sold these businesses to Aurochs Investment Company, although Khazam remained on as managing director. By 1968 the Khazam family firm of Anglo-African Finance owned 49.5% of Jeremiah Rotherham, and they agreed to a takeover by rival company Spencer, Turner and Boldero. In some respects this was more of a merger because Anglo-African Finance also had considerable interest in Spencer, Turner and Boldero. Further rationalisation took place within the group of businesses run by the Khazam-Yentob family over the following years and evolved into Dewhurst Dent Limited. The company still has members of both families on the board of directors. The Khazam-Yentob families had dealings in other sectors apart from textiles. In South Africa they were associated with companies that included automotive and mineral exploration.Don Wilkinson Local takeover of Khazam Yentob group rumoured The Citizen, Johannesburg, DTIC ADA346221: Sub-Saharan Africa Report, No. 2830, P.111' 28 June 1983 Flora (Khazam) Yentob was the mother of creative director Alan Yentob.

He was a seven times winner of the Oaks in addition to winning the Scottish Greyhound Derby and Welsh Greyhound Derby. Early Life Biss spent his childhood living at the Queens Head public house in Waltham Abbey before becoming an Assurance Agent. In 1917 he joined the Navy and Royal Air Force as a Corporal mechanic. He married Agnes Oyler in 1923. Racing career Biss was one of the original trainers at Wimbledon Stadium when the stadium opened in 1928 during the pioneer years of oval racing. In 1929 Biss trained out of Burhill Kennels and was in charge of some of the leading greyhounds in the country which included Bradshaw Fold and Queen of the Suir. He also helped fellow Burhill trainer Sidney Orton and the Kempton family acquire the legendary Mick The Miller. During 1930 he joined West Ham Stadium, the same year that Bradshaw Fold finished second to Mick The Miller in the 1930 English Greyhound Derby final. One month later, in July he trained Captured Half when winning the Scottish Derby and Faithful Kitty claimed the Oaks in August. His kennels suffered a major fire in 1931 which killed three greyhounds including a leading runner called Gone For Sure. Biss was regarded as one of the leading trainers in the country and continued to train major race winners, including Queen of the Suir (Oaks 1932 and 1933), Flying Wedge (Grand National 1937) and Brave Queen (Oaks 1937). Lutwyche also reached the 1933 English Greyhound Derby final. In 1939 Biss fell afoul of the racing authorities receiving a suspension and he left West Ham. With the outbreak of World War II racing in London became fractured, Biss concentrated on his business of poultry farming on his Waltham Cross Farm but did take out a private trainers licence after being reinstated. After the war Biss joined Clapton Stadium and in 1946 steered Celtic Chief through to the Derby final, the same year in which Dumbles Maid won a fifth Oaks for Biss. In 1947 Rimmells Black won the Scurry Gold Cup and Laurels, Rio Cepretta won the Oaks and Patsys Record reached the Derby final. The year was ruined by a serious fire at Waltham Cross Farm that destroyed a building and a mushroom crop. The following year the brilliant Local Interprize ran second in the 1948 Derby and Biss won five classic races the same year, arguably his greatest year as a trainer. Retirement and death Biss retired in 1951 handing the Denver Lodge kennels to head girl Pam Heasman, he died in 1952 after suffering a stroke.

S. in Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, 1986 following the completion of his B. S. in Control Engineering, Nanjing University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China, 1983  Career  In 2000, Zhou joined the faculty of New Jersey Institute of Technology where in 2013, Zhou became a Distinguished Professor at The Helen and John C. Hartmann Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. There, he serves as researcher of Petri Nets and their applications, Director of the M.S. Program in Power and Energy Systems, Director of the M.S. Program in Computer Engineering, Director of Discrete Event Systems Laboratory, Director of CRRC-ZIC Laboratory for Rail System Network and Information Technologies, and Area Coordinator of Intelligent Systems. Previous to his career as professor, Zhou worked at Beijing Institute of Computer Applications, where he was an assistant engineer responsible for the development of CAD/CAM for vehicles.  Significant contributions  Petri nets are a modeling tool playing the same role in event- driven systems as the differential/difference equations in continuous dynamic systems. As the size and complexity of automated systems increase, ad hoc methods lose their effectiveness, and a strong need arises for systematic methods of analysis and design. Zhou's work is about such methods - including their modeling, analysis, and synthesis of various automated systems. In 1991, Zhou provided the theoretical basis for Petri net synthesis methods that model systems with shared resources. He formulated two new resource- sharing concepts: parallel mutual exclusion (PME) and sequential mutual exclusion (SME). PME models a resource shared by distinct independent processes. SME is a sequential composition of PMEs, modeling a resource shared by sequentially related processes. Zhou derived the conditions under which a net containing such structures will not have a total system shut down (deadlock). His approach enabled flexible design of systems that met constraints, and optimized performance. The synthesized models could be converted to supervisory controllers for automated systems. To simplify the optimal control design for any given automated system, his work invented the elementary and dependent siphons of Petri nets - important structural objects for characterizing deadlocks. He also invented several deadlock control methods for automated systems. Their use reduced the structural complexity of supervisory controllers - - they became linear with respect to system size. For certain systems, optimal controllers were developed with polynomially complex algorithms, thereby allowing for the first time, on- line deployment of optimal control methods. Thousands of researchers and engineers use his methods in various applications for automated system design, analysis, and control. Factories which use Zhou‚Äôs methods are thereby able to both prevent deadlock and simultaneously operate at maximum productivity - a rare combination in complex automated systems. Zhou was among the pioneers of Petri net- based methods for semiconductor manufacturing, in particular, robotic cells called cluster tools, widely used in today‚Äôs semiconductor wafer fabrication plants. His survey- type papers popularized and greatly increased acceptance of Petri nets in system designs and applications (e.g., work published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, and IEEE Robotics and Automation Magaz ine). Several of his patents have been licensed to dozens of industrial firms and put into industrial use, generating significant economic outcomes. Helping substantially improve the productivity of manufacturing semiconductor wafers and chips, this has a direct impact on lowering manufacturing costs and significantly increasing bottom line profitability in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Zhou has made contributions to the advancement of Petri net theory and their applications in automated systems. He has published over 400 papers in IEEE Transactions and Journals (majority being regular papers) and over 100 in other journals. He has authored/coathored 12 patents, 12 books, 29 book chapters and over 300 conference- proceeding papers. He is the world‚Äôs most cited researcher on Petri nets, and one of the overall leading researchers in automated manufacturing systems (Scopus). Web of Science ranked Zhou in 2012 as the number one most highly cited scholar in engineering worldwide and has listed him as a \\"highly cited scholar\\" in engineering since then. His recognition includes four Fellow designations - by IEEE for contributions to Petri nets and their applications; by AAAS for distinguished contributions to Petri nets, discrete event systems, and their applications to manufacturing, transportation, workflow, disassembly, web services, and software design; by the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) for seminal contributions to the theory of Petri nets and their application in manufacturing, transportation, and web services; and by Chinese Association of Automation for contributions to the field of automation.

He served as Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1706 to 1708. Early life McClellan was descended from the McClellans of Raeberry Castle near Bomby in Kirkcudbright.Old Kirkcudbright He was the eldest son of Rev Patrick McClellan (died 1666) of Girthon near Kirkcudbright and his wife Jean Primrose. He was apprenticed to Robert Douglas, an Edinburgh merchant, and after Douglas died in 1679, he was admitted as a burgess of Edinburgh in his own right. MacClellan retained some interest during the 1670s in property in the stewartry (in 1676 he is recorded as owner of the Tannifad and Whinniehill farm estates) but he focused his attention on Edinburgh. In 1681, he invested ¬£100 in the new cloth manufactory at the Newmills Cloth Manufactory at Amisfield Haddington, east of Edinburgh. With an employment force of 700, it was one of the largest factories in all Scotland.Amisfield He and his partners secured a series of important contracts for military uniforms. In 1690 he received a lucrative contract for 647 military red coats from Alexander Gordon, Viscount Kenmure, replacing uniforms damaged in the Battle of Killiecrankie. Career McLellan was treasurer to Kirk sessions at Edinburgh in 1690, and a merchant councillor from 1692 to 1693. He was baron bailie for Leith in 1693 and old bailie in 1695. By 1694, he married Marjorie Thomson. From 1696 to 1698, he was treasurer for the city. In 1696 he bought shares in the ill-fated Company of Scotland, also buying ¬£3000 on behalf of the City of Edinburgh probably in his capacity as City Treasurer.>Green Galloway However, despite investment he was not an official company member. The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 In 1697 McLellan took over the stewart and justiciar, Orkney and Shetland,Stewartry of Orkney, supplying goods to the island, and ensuring such supply from others. In 1702, he was old dean of guild and became a magistrate in 1704. He was dean of guild in 1705 and in 1706 was elected Lord Provost of Edinburgh in succession to Sir Patrick Johnston at Michaelmas 1706.List of Lord Provosts of Edinburgh: Edinburgh City Chambers Johnston rather than McClellan was the broker of the Act of Union 1707, but McClellan, as a major investor in the Company of Scotland, received compensation for his losses in the company under the terms of agreement of the Act of Union. McLellan was burgess of Perth in 1708, and at the 1708 British general election, was returned as Member of Parliament for Edinburgh. He was given a detailed set of instructions from his constituents and was voted ¬£300 for expenses in London. The convention of royal burghs also promised him ¬£100 to promote their interests. At Michaelmas 1708, he was succeeded as Lord Provost by Johnston, who returned to office after a period of self-imposed exile. His record in Parliament does show much activity, and he did not meet any of his constituent's objectives, but he claimed an additional sum of ¬£106 7s. 2d in expenses. He also looked after his own interests while in London. He gave financial inducements to Robert Walpole and Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet, to secure Scottish forage contracts. Death and legacy McLellan died on 22 September 1709 leaving three sons and four daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, James, who subsequently made an abortive bid for the barony of Kirkcudbright, claiming to be the nearest male heir to a peerage that had failed in its main line.He was father of P. MacLellan (Patrick?), who is noted as a donor to the Orphan Hospital in 1770.An Historical Account of the Orphan Hospital of Edinburgh and was grandfather to William McClellan, 6th Lord Kirkcudbright.Debrett's Peerage of Scotland His deals for forage contracts were censured in the report of the public accounts commissioners on 21 December 1711.

Conservative estimates placed the storm's death toll at 116. The storm was already well-developed when it was first noted passing westward over the Windward Islands into the Caribbean Sea on August 16\\\\. A ship near Grenada with 74 occupants was lost, constituting a plurality of the deaths associated with the storm. The following day, the storm intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak strength on August 20 with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). At this intensity, the major hurricane made landfall on Jamaica later that day, traversing the length of the island. The damage wrought was extensive, with the strong winds destroying 90 percent of banana trees and 41 percent of coconut trees in Jamaica; the overall damage toll was estimated at \\"several millions of dollars\\". The northern coast of Jamaica saw the most severe damage, with widespread structural damage and numerous homes destroyed across several parishes. In Port Maria, the storm was considered the worst since 1903. Land interaction weakened the hurricane, and the storm maintained this lessened intensity as it passed the Cayman Islands, producing measured gusts of . On August 22, the hurricane moved ashore the Yucat√°n Peninsula near Cozumel and eventually emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a tropical storm. On August 24, the storm made landfall for a final time near Tampico, Mexico, bringing with it heavy rains that caused flooding throughout the coasts of Veracruz and Texas, killing 12. The storm dissipated over the mountainous terrain of inland Mexico later that day. Heavy rains were reported across the Rio Grande Valley, causing minor flooding. A tornado produced by the storms killed one person in McCook, Texas and injured fifteen others. Meteorological history On August 16, 1944, decreased pressures just east of Barbados were indicative of a passing tropical storm. The storm's first entry in the official Atlantic hurricane database lists the system as already possessing winds of ; the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project noted that the possibility that the tropical cyclone forming east of the Lesser Antilles remains ambiguous due to a lack of observations over the open Atlantic. Not long after its first detection, the tropical storm intensified into a hurricane on August 17 as it crossed into the Caribbean Sea near Grenada. Gradual intensification took hold as the storm progressed west-northwestwards across the Caribbean. A ship en route to Buenos Aires, Argentina crossed the eye of the hurricane south of Puerto Rico the following day, recording a central pressure of 973 mbar (hPa; 28.73 inHg); this was the lowest pressure measured in connection with the storm. On the following day, the small tropical cyclone strengthened into the equivalent of a on the modern Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, making the storm a major hurricane. At around 16:00 UTC on August 20, the hurricane made landfall in the vicinity of Boston Bay along the coast of Jamaica with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). At landfall, the hurricane's eye spanned across, resulting in a 15‚Äì20 minute lull in winds over eastern portions of Jamaica as the eye passed overhead. The storm traversed the island over several hours, emerging near Montego Bay by 23:00 UTC that day as a weakened system equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. The storm largely maintained its strength in the western Caribbean Sea, passing near Grand Cayman on August 21 with the same intensity with which it departed from Jamaica. The following morning, the hurricane struck the Yucat√°n Peninsula near Cozumel Island and degenerated into a tropical storm over the peninsula. Despite reemerging over the Bay of Campeche, weakening continued; the system ultimately moved ashore near Tuxpan, Mexico as a minimal tropical storm early on August 24 before dissipating inland later that day. Preparations, impact, and aftermath =Jamaica= alt=Political map of northeastern Jamaica showing the local relief, roads, and communities. On August 19, the United States Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for Jamaica and advised precaution to points in the Caribbean west and northwest of the island. Waves began buffeting the Jamaican coast in advance of the storm: a \\"very heavy\\" swell was noted along Palisadoes with the center still away. Early reports, although scant, suggested that the hurricane was one of the most significant in Jamaica's history, with no comparable storm in the preceding two decades. The most powerful effects were felt in the Blue Mountains, resulting in a swath of devastation on the northern shore of Jamaica. The island sustained heavy losses to its banana and coconut crop, with an estimated damage toll of several millions of dollars. An estimated 90 percent of banana trees and 41 percent of coconut trees were lost. These crops were primarily located in the parishes of Clarendon, Portland, Saint Thomas, Saint Catherine, and Trelawny, as well as in the Montego Bay valley. Within the core coconut-producing region between Saint Thomas and Saint Ann, 30 percent of coconuts were either blown down or destroyed. Entire coconut plantations were denuded by the strong winds. Heavy rains caused the reservoir at Hermitage Dam to overflow‚Äîthe reservoir's water level was initially below the spillway. The of rainfall measured in the dam's watershed was a record for the area. In total, over 30 fatalities occurred in Jamaica, primarily as a result of the hurricane's strong winds. The severest damage was inflicted upon Portland, Saint Ann, and Saint Mary parishes. Five people were killed and many others reportedly injured in Saint Mary Parish. Numerous homes were destroyed in the parish, leaving hundreds of people displaced. In the parish's capital town of Port Maria, nearly all buildings sustained damage and hundreds of people including infants and schoolchildren required immediate assistance; a hospital was destroyed in nearby Annotto Bay, injuring 40 people. The Daily Gleaner called the hurricane Port Maria's worst storm since 1903, as an estimated 75 percent of buildings in the town were at least heavily damaged. The parish's church sustained significant damage, with both of its transepts unroofed and clergy house destroyed. The overturning of two railway cars in Annotto Bay suggested that winds reached there. A copra factory in the adjacent communities of Frontier and Wentworth was also badly damaged. At least six people were killed in Saint Ann Parish. Most homes located on the parish waterfront were destroyed. In Saint Ann's Bay, the court house and parish church all sustained heavy damage. Sugar stores and factories in the town were damaged. Port Antonio in Portland Parish was heavily damaged by the hurricane‚Äînearly all buildings were damaged, with most flattened and others unroofed. Several public buildings, including the city's town hall and court house, were either damaged or destroyed. A five-ward poorhouse was destroyed and several schools lost their roofs. Two people were killed in the port by flying debris. All telecommunication lines were downed in Port Antonio and electricity and transportation service was hampered. Virtually all homes in Buff Bay were damaged, and three churches were destroyed. Ninety-five percent of coconut trees in the settlement were blown down, as well as local banana and breadfruit plantations. Many other communities in Portland Parish suffered similar effects, reporting the destruction of most of their buildings; thousands were left homeless. The Member of Parliament for the parish, H. E. Allen, conservatively estimated the number of homeless persons at 6,000, along with the complete loss of the banana industry and significant loss to coconut trees. Three people were killed and several others injured in Skibo, with considerable losses to livestock reported throughout the parish. At Famouth in Trelawny Parish, the Rose Hall Sugar Factory lost its chimney, and a police station away was destroyed; 500‚Äì600 people were rendered homeless in the parish. Other communities in Trelawny reported numerous destroyed homes and an 80‚Äì100 percent loss of bananas. Small houses were destroyed and a girls' school severely damaged in Montego Bay in Saint James Parish by winds, with the storm's severest effects lasting for roughly two hours. One indirect death was reported in the city. Winds in the capital city of Kingston topped out at . Damage to buildings in the capital city was relatively minor, though transportation and electrical service was disrupted. Fallen trees and fencing tore wires and laid across tramways and streets. Flooding rivers exacerbated the traffic disruptions, submerging or destroying bridges across several parishes. Communications between Kingston and the rest of Jamaica were also severed. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew Parish, widespread crop and infrastructure damage occurred in Swains Spring, Coopers Hill, and Padmore. At Spanish Town in Saint Catherine Parish, trees were uprooted and communications lost between the town and Kingston. While businesses there otherwise avoided significant impacts, their roofs were damaged. Most homes and plantations were destroyed in districts in western Saint Andrew Parish, displacing hundreds of people. Following the storm, The Daily Gleaner initiated a relief fund to aid in the storm's aftermath; the fund was later managed by the Central Council of Voluntary Social Services. On August 22, Governor of Jamaica Sir John Huggins compelled a conference at Hibbert House with all heads of the colony's ministries, establishing a Central Relief Committee to coordinate with local relief operations and serve as the government's principal communications channel vis-√†-vis hurricane relief. =Elsewhere= Across the Caribbean outside of Jamaica, the hurricane's effects were scattered. A British vessel near Grenada with 74 people onboard was lost. Gusts of swept over the Cayman Islands. One station documented a gust of early on August 21. A ship was lost off the Yucat√°n Peninsula, though information on its crew and effects was unknown. Twelve people were killed in Veracruz as a result of flooding from the hurricane's third and final landfall near Tuxpan. Others‚Äìtheir numbers unknown‚Äìwere missing following a surge of meltwater from Pico de Orizaba triggered by the tropical storm. Communication lines were downed in Tampico, delaying early damage reports. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a storm warning for the lower Texas coast from Matagorda Bay to Brownsville, anticipating that the hurricane would eventually make landfall in the Brownsville area. Aircraft stationed at coastal airfields were moved farther inland, and small craft northwards to the Louisiana coast were brought to port. The passing storm brought heavy rains to the Rio Grande Valley, with rainfall totals reaching over in Brownsville. Roma reported on the night of August 22, marking the first rainfall event of that magnitude in nearly a decade. A slightly rain- swollen Rio Grande resulted in minor flooding downstream, disrupting transportation between the United States‚ÄìMexico border southward to Monterrey, Mexico. Projections suggested that a few hundred acres of crops in the immediate floodplain would be inundated, with marginal effects elsewhere. Five oil wells in Wilacy County were suspended after the flooding cut off their water supplies. A tornado struck McCook, killing one person and injuring fifteen others; fourteen of the injured were located in a single home. Crop damage was also reported in connection with the tornado.

It wasn't until after World War II that the company's fortunes forever changed with the introduction of Maalox which would become the world's best selling antacid.Wallace, Andy. \\"Claude Newhart, 87; helped develop Maalox\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, 20 May 1995, p.C7 History alt= Willaim H. Rorer founded William H. Rorer, Inc. in 1910 while working as a pharmacist in Pennsylvania. The business remained small, primarily selling pain relievers until 1949 when it introduced Maalox. Maalox was developed in collaboration between William H. Rorer, Inc. and a medical doctor and researcher specializing in gastrointestinal issues, Alison Howe Price from Philadelphia. The collaboration came about after World War II when Claude Newhart, a salesman and pharmacist for the company had an idea that he thought might change the company‚Äôs fortunes. According to the Rorer family, he suggested that instead of selling pain relievers that the company didn‚Äôt manufacture, they should create their own products. Gerald Rorer, president of Rorer and son of the founder, told Mr. Newhart to ‚Äúgo and find something.‚Äù Mr. Newhart took up the challenge and contacted an old acquaintance from his student days employed at a drugstore in Philadelphia, Martin H. Rehfuss, who happened to be chief of medicine at Thomas Jefferson Hospital. It was Mr. Rehfuss who introduced Mr. Newhart to Dr. Price. It wasn‚Äôt long before Mr. Newhart convinced Price to become a consultant for the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania based Willam H. Rorer, Inc. And it so happened that the first product the partnership produced was Maalox.Wallace, Andy. \\"Claude Newhart, 87; helped develop Maalox\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, 20 May 1995, p.C7 It eventually would become the world's best selling antacid and forever change the company's fortunes. In 1965 the company introduced Quaalude (quiet interlude), similar in spelling to its top-selling antacid, Maalox, but it turned out to be far less successful for the company. The FDA withdrew Quaalude in 1984. Headquarters Rorer's was headquartered in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania. Products Mergers and acquisitions For many years Maalox comprised a large proportion of the drugmaker's sales. In order to diversify Rorer merged with AmChem in 1968, an agricultural herbicide producer to form Rorer-AmChem. The merger did not turn out to be profitable and in 1977 Rorer sold AmChem to Union Carbide. By the late 1980s the pharmaceutical industry had experienced significant mergers, making it very difficult for Rorer to compete. In 1990 the company merged with Rhone-Poulenc SA, France's largest pharmaceuticals company for 3.2 billion dollars. At the time of the merger, the Maalox lineup still represented one of the company's most important revenue streams.

She is notable for being one of the first women in the craft brewing industry and her brews have been widely awarded from organizations such as Great American Beer Festival and the Brewer's Association. Early life and education Fahrendorf was raised in a German family in Wisconsin and is the oldest of four children. She began baking bread at the age of 10, which she credits as her first attempt at fermentation. While she was creative with cooking, Fahrendorf pursued a college degree at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, studying Management Information Systems (business major with an emphasis on computers, COBOL programming); the project management skills she developed helped her later in her brewing career. During college years, a classmate's presentation on making wine sparked her interest; she used the ‚ÄúBalloon wine‚Äù method, combining Welch‚Äôs grape juice concentrate, yeast, and sugar. Following her college graduation in 1984, she moved to the San Francisco Bay area to work at two Fortune 100 companies (Honeywell and Burroughs, which became Unisys) doing software services and software support. She continued homebrewing, but since wine in the area was cheap, in 1985 she turned to homebrewing beer instead. She joined a homebrewing club, the San Andreas Malts, where she learned the foundational ingredients and processes for beer brewing: malts, hops, yeast, and temperature. During this time, she also attended events such as the American Homebrewers Association Conference and the Great American Beer Festival.  Early work as a brewmaster  In 1988, Fahrendorf quit her job as a computer programmer to attend the Siebel Institute in Chicago, where she earned a degree in Brewing Technology and worked at an internship at the Sieben River North Brewpub. Upon her return to California from Chicago, she began her career in brewing at the Golden Gate Brewing Company in Berkeley in March 1989. Golden Gate Brewing changed management prior to her hire and a variety of factors, such as improper layout, led to what Fahrendorf refers to as her \\"worst brewing experience\\". As she brewed 10 barrels in a 7 barrel system on May 1, 1989, she filled a kettle with 50 gallons of water to sterilize it and to later use to top off the kettle after mash-in. During the brewing process at Golden Gate, the design of the kettle required the brewmaster empty the kettle of its last 2-3 gallons when the pump drew air, cavitating loudly. On the day of the accident, Fahrendorf began her routine, and as she worked she heard the pump cavitating, marking the time to drain the remaining 2-3 gallons from the kettle. As she removed the tri-clamp to begin this process, 50 gallons of boiling water gushed out, filling Fahrendorf's left boot. The improper layout of the brewery left her with no clear escape route; however, she was able to duck between the bars on the railings and escape the boiling water, but not before there was severe damage done to her legs and feet, particularly her left side. The accident resulted in 3rd degree burns on 11% of her body, which required surgery and skin grafts from her scalp. Following her accident, Fahrendorf became an advocate for promoting safety in breweries and continues to include the story of the injury in her public talks or interviews. Fahrendorf left Golden Gate for a position at Triple Rock Brewing, also located in Berkeley, California, where she was the Head Brewer. In 1990, she attended the Oregon Brewers Fest, which led her to a job in Oregon at Steelhead Brewing.  Work at Steelhead Brewing Company  After time spent at Triple Rock Brewing, Fahrendorf moved to Oregon when she took a job at Steelhead Brewing Company in Eugene, Oregon. Steelhead was the second craft brewery to open in Eugene, and Fahrendorf began work there on September 17, 1990. She became the Brewmaster, working for Steelhead for 17 years. Her alcoholic creations won awards, including a Bombay Bomber that had \\"near cult status\\" when she brewed it in Eugene and a Great American Beer Festival Silver Medal for \\"U.C.I.P.A.\\", but she was also known for creating the recipe for the company's well-regarded root beer. She recounts on her time spent at Steelhead through the 1990s, and notes of the large expansion of craft breweries that occurred on the west coast during this time. In her reflections on that time, she noted that although many brewers transferred to different breweries of worked in many different locations, she preferred to stay in Eugene. She credits this longevity with her survival during the craft brewery crash of the early 2000s.  Road brewer  In 2007, Fahrendorf left her job at Steelhead Brewing Company to become what she termed as a \\"road brewer\\". She traveled from June 4 to October 20 and traveled across the United States from Oregon to Maine and back, a trip totaling 12,656 miles. During her trip, Fahrendorf visited a total of 70 breweries and brewed at 38 of them, forming connections with brewers across the country in the process. During her trip, Fahrendorf met female brewers who reported feelings of isolation as the only women working in the brewery; as a result, she recognized a need for an organization that would act as a community for women brewers to connect and share information, and collected the names of the women she met for the duration of her trip. That list formed the kernel of the Pink Boots Society.  Founding of the Pink Boots Society and Barley's Angels  Fahrendorf is an advocate for other women and has worked to increase the number of women in the brewing industries. She created the Pink Boots Society (PBS) after traveling through the country as a Road Brewer. In her oral history interview, she claims there is no glass ceiling in brewing, with the exception of the brewery education system. She does recognize that the most difficult part of breaking into the industry had to do her physical size since brewing is a very physical job. She credits Mellie Pullman as a large influence in her early career; Pullman the first female brewmaster in the United States after she started working at Park City, Utah's Schirf Brewing (later Wasatch Brewery) in 1986. Using the connections she made on her trip, she organized the first meeting of the Pink Boots Society (so named after the pink rubber boots Fahrendorf wore while brewing on her trip) in San Diego in April 2008. This meeting included 16 brewers and 6 beer writers; these women decided Pink Boots Society should be a professional organization to support women involved in the brewing industry around the world. The second meeting of the Pink Boots Society was held in December 2008 and there were 35 attendees; the organization continued to grow and in 2017 had nearly 1,900 members. They are recognized as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and currently focus on scholarship, education, and outreach for women in brewing. The archival material for the Pink Boots Society is held within the Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives in the Special Collections and Archives Research Center (SCARC) of Oregon State University (OSU). Fahrendorf was also involved in Barley's Angels, and organization with chapters across the country which focuses on expanding the knowledge and appreciation of craft beer among women.  Present day work  Since her road trip and creation of the Pink Boots Society, Fahrendorf continue to work in the craft brewing industry and her current position is as a Malt Innovation Center Manager for Great Western Malting. Her career accomplishments include the brewing eight of Steelhead's 24 award-winning beers for the Great American Beer Festival, being a published technical author and speaker, and receiving the Brewers Association 2014 Recognition Award.

From 1976 to 1982 he was Director of the Hematology Division at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, and from 1977 to 1989 he was an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. During a nearly 50-year time span, Bunn played a major role in the training of medical students during their four years at Harvard Medical School, and residents and fellows at Brigham and Women's Hospital. From 1991 until 1998, he directed the Harvard-Markey Program in Biomedical Sciences that gives graduate students an additional year of training in human biology and the pathophysiology of disease. The first 20 years of Bunn‚Äôs research focused on hemoglobin. His major work included the demonstration that free hemoglobin in the circulating plasma is excreted by the kidney owing to the dissociation of the a2b2 tetramer into ab dimers, discovery of the hemoglobin binding site of the physiologically important modifier 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate, demonstration that surface charge determines the proportion of commonly encountered mutant hemoglobins in heterozygotes, discovery of the first example of a hemoglobin frame shift mutation, establishment of sequence dependent rules for the cleavage of the initiator methionine and N-acetylation, demonstration with Paul Gallop that the minor hemoglobin component HbA1c contains glucose attached to the N-terminus of the beta globin chain by a ketosamine linkage, providing the rationale for the measurement of HbA1c as an index of long-term control in diabetics with later work indicating that this glucose dependent modification is a likely contributor to the long-term complications of diabetes.The second 20 years of Bunn's research focused on identification of domains on erythropoietin (EPO) that bind to its receptor, and on characterization of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIFa transcription factor responsible for hypoxic induction of EPO and other physiologically relevant proteins.

Taxonomy Chilonatalus macer was described as a new species in 1914 by American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller. The holotype had been collected in Baracoa, Cuba by William Palmer in 1902. Prior to 2011, it was frequently included as a subspecies within the Cuban funnel-eared bat, Chilonatalus micropus. However, it is now most often regarded as a full species. Description It has a short forearm length of . Individuals weigh only . Biology and ecology Chilonatalus macer is insectivorous, consuming moths but also spiders. At any time, its stomach can hold up to 28.6% of its body weight. It is a colonial species, and forms aggregations in caves typically consisting of 30-50 individuals. In cool or dry caves, however, some individuals have been documented roosting solitarily. Range and habitat Chilonatalus macer is found only in Cuba, where its range is the island of Cuba as well as the Isla de la Juventud. Fossil evidence supports that it was once found on the island of Grand Cayman as well. In Cuba, it has been documented at a range of elevations from above sea level. Its habitat includes mesic forest, though it has been documented in drier habitat as well. It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as humid caves.

(1587 ‚Äì 23 October 1664), commonly known as Maria van Pallaes, was a Dutch philanthropist who established the Maria van Pallaes houses in the city of Utrecht. They consist of 12 almshouses and a refectory, together with a or courtyard garden, to be used by the city's poor. After her death, the buildings were placed under the control of the Maria van Pallaes Foundation and another 28 almshouses were later built using her inheritance. The original 12 houses and refectory are now owned by the and are a Dutch national heritage site.  Early life  Van Pallaes was born in 1587 in the Dutch city of Utrecht. She was the oldest child of Lubbert Jansz van Pallaes (died 1610) and Maria Johansdr van Reede (died 1649). She had two younger brothers: Lubbertus (died 1624) and Johan (died 1650). Both her parents came from patrician families and she was raised as a Roman Catholic. On 11 January 1606, at the age of 19, Van Pallaes married Hendrick van Schroyesteijn, a lawyer at the court of Utrecht, in the presence of the city's aldermen. He was also a Roman Catholic. Van Pallaes had more possessions and capital than Van Schroyesteijn at the time of their marriage. They bought a house along the Oudegracht but later moved to on where Van Pallaes lived for the rest of her life. The couple had six children: Johan, Lubbertus, Adriana, Margaretha, Livinius and Hendrick. In Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn's will of 1624, their oldest son, Johan, was not mentioned as an heir; he was presumably disinherited but it is not known why. From 1624 Johan was not mentioned in any other documents or wills by Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn. The youngest child, Hendrick, had not yet been born in 1624 and is therefore not mentioned in the will. Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn remained Roman Catholics for the rest of their lives. As a result of the Dutch Reformation, practising their Catholic faith had been prohibited in Utrecht since 1580. Nevertheless, they continued their devotions, making use of clandestine churches; Van Pallaes' mother similarly practised Catholicism in Utrecht after the Reformation, despite having been raised as a Calvinist. Two of Van Pallaes' children had Catholic religious vocations: Hendrick became a priest and Adriana became a Carmelite in Antwerp.  Later life  Van Pallaes lost most of her loved ones in her later life. First, her son Livinius died when about 10 in 1624. Six years later, her husband, Van Schroyesteijn, died in 1630. She also lost four other children: Margaretha, the only child to be married, died in 1645; Lubbertus in 1646, Hendrick before 1649, and Johan, the oldest child, in . As all Van Pallaes' children remained childless, there were no grandchildren. Van Pallaes owned various houses in Utrecht as well as estates and residences in the surroundings. In 1649, she sent a request to the government of Utrecht, asking for permission to freely decide over her inheritance. Her only remaining child, Adriana, was a member of a mendicant order and, as such, was not able to inherit. If Van Pallaes had not filed a request, her family fortune would have gone to the community of Utrecht. She decided to use her funds as charity for the city's needy inhabitants. It is likely that she did not just do so because she cared for the poor but because she believed she would be rewarded with a place in heaven after her death. = Foundation of the first almshouses = alt=A black and white picture showing a row of houses, taken from the corner of the street In 1651, Van Pallaes bought land from Utrecht's to establish a or collection of buildings with an adjoining court on the street now known as the Agnietenstraat. She charged a general contractor (whose identity is not known) to build 12 almshouses and a refectory there. Each house was designed to have two floors, with two rooms on each floor, except for one of them, which had a different layout. The houses were , with a community garden to the rear. This garden had a few toilets attached to its walls in groups of two or three and connected to a cesspit. The corner house served as a refectory and meeting place for the administrators of the foundation (who were appointed to that position by Van Pallaes in her will). Residents could only eat in the refectory if, for some reason, they were unable to eat in their own homes. Sometimes they were invited to the refectory to meet the administrators. The refectory was rebuilt as an additional building in 1667, three years after Van Pallaes' death. As of 2019, the building still maintains the original locks. All residents of the houses were subject to various conditions. First of all, those receiving support from the diaconate or similar sources were not eligible for residence. Second, residents were housed either with their spouse or with another individual of the same sex. If a spouse died, they were not allowed to remarry and were forced to leave. Third, residents who committed physical violence or had an \\"unsuitable\\" lifestyle were dismissed. Fourth, when residents died, their inheritance was transferred to the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which paid for their funeral. Unusually for the times, Van Pallaes allowed both Catholics and Protestants to live in the houses. Every year, the residents received wheat, butter and cheese, partly grown by Van Pallaes' tenant farmers, from the foundation. Van Pallaes was probably present herself on such occasions. After her death, the foundation's administrators handed out the food while sitting under a painting of Van Pallaes. In 1849, residents started receiving ∆í10, of potatoes and of coal every year instead of the wheat, butter and cheese. Towards the end of the 20th century, they stopped receiving money, as new social security programs rendered financial support unnecessary.  Death  After a long period of sickness, Van Pallaes died on 23 October 1664. An extensive and costly funeral ceremony was held following her death. The bells of St. Martin's Cathedral were rung, as were those of St. Jan's Church, the Buurkerk and Saint Nicholas' Church. After the funeral, she was interred in her family grave at St. Martin's Cathedral. Ten years later, the grave was destroyed in a tornado. = Inheritance = After Van Palleas' death, her property was inherited by the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which was headed by the two directors she had appointed. From that point on, incumbent directors would select their successors themselves. Over the course of the foundation's existence, an additional 28 almshouses were constructed using Van Pallaes' inheritance. The foundation continued to operate until 1910, when the municipal executive board of Utrecht started managing the houses. In 1978, the municipality bought the houses, transferring ownership of the original 12 almshouses and the refectory to the Utrecht Monument Foundation two years later.  Legacy  The foundation's original almshouses and refectory were granted rijksmonument status in 1967 which, as of March 2020, they still hold. In 2015, a corbel was revealed honouring Van Palles. The corbel shows two hands giving away apples and was designed and created by Cissy van der Wel. = Painting by Hendrick Bloemaert = Yearly food distribution to the poor of Utrecht by Maria van Pallaes, a painting by alt=A painting that shows a woman, Van Pallaes, sitting on a chair with various well-dressed individuals behind her.

Without the king's initials, the coat of arms was also used in Swedish Livonia the part of the region that came under the control of the Swedish Empire in the 1620s. Since 1677, the coat of arms of Polish Livonia (the Inflanty Voivodeship, roughly corresponding to today's Latgale) included a ducal crown. After the incorporation of Estonia and Livonia into the Russian Empire in 1710, the Russian Governorate of Riga and later the Governorate of Livonia have been granted coats of arms basing on the historical coat of arms of Livonia. After the establishment of the independent Latvian state, the symbol of Livonia, representing the Latvian regions Vidzeme and Latgalia, became part of the newly created Coat of arms of Latvia.

Slave uprising  On 2 June 1760 the Corona Ottomana left Constantinople with 750 men on board, including 71 Christian slaves. Its mission was to collect taxes from the Levant on behalf of the Ottoman Treasury. The slaves captured the ship whilst the other men were on land collecting taxes. Led by Giovanni del Core, they sailed the ship to Malta. Once in Malta the ship was renamed the San Salvador, and added to the squadron of the Knights Hospitallers. After the Turkish Sultan threatened to invade Malta, the Knights Hospitallers agreed to return the ship to the Ottoman Porte in return for a large indemnity. The ship returned to Constantinople in 1762.

He showed promising form as a juvenile in 2018 when he won one minor race as well as finishing third in the Eyrefield Stakes and fourth in the Beresford Stakes. In the following year he was placed in the Ballysax Stakes and the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial before running unplaced when acting as a pacemaker in the 2019 Epsom Derby. He was given little chance in the Irish Derby but won easily at odds of 33/1. Background Sovereign is a chestnut colt with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Ireland by the County Wicklow-based Barronstown Stud. He entered the ownership of the Coolmore Stud organisation and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership have changed from race to race but he has usually been described as being owned by a partnership of Michael Tabor, Derrick Smith and Susan Magnier. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Sovereign's dam Devoted To You showed good racing ability, winning one minor race and finishing second in the Debutante Stakes. Devoted To You's dam Alleged Devotion was a half-sister to Balanchine. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Sovereign started at odds of 100/30 for a maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse on 21 June and finished fifth, beaten seven and a half lengths by the Dermot Weld- trained winner Masaff. He was ridden in this race by Padraig Beggy a Ballydoyle work rider who had come to prominence in 2017 by winning the Epsom Derby on the 40/1 outsider Wings of Eagles. Two months later he was partnered by Michael Hussey in a similar event over one mile at the Curragh and came home sixth of the fourteen runners as victory went to his stablemate Mount Everest. On 18 September at Galway Races the colt started favourite for a maiden over eight and a half furlongs on heavy ground in which he was ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien. Sovereign took the lead soon after the start, went clear of his rivals approaching the last quarter mile and recorded his first success as he won \\"easily\\" by fourteen lengths despite being eased down by O'Brien in the closing stages. Twelve days after his win at Galway the colt was stepped up in class and started the 3/1 second choice in the betting behind Mount Everest in the Group 2 Beresford Stakes at Naas Racecourse. With O'Brien in the saddle he led for most of the way but was outpaced in the last two furlongs and came home fourth as the Ballydoyle third string Japan won narrowly from Mount Everest. He ended his season in the Group 3 Eyrefield Stakes at Leopardstown on 27 October in which he made the running before being overtaken in the final furlong and finishing third to Guaranteed (trained by Jim Bolger) and Masaff. In the official ratings for Irish-raced juveniles for 2018 Sovereign was given a mark of 103, making him 18 pounds inferior to the top-rated Quorto. =2019: three-year-old season= On his first two runs as a three-year-old Sovereign was partnered by Seamie Heffernan. He began his campaign in the Group 3 Ballysax Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown on 27 April when he proved no match for his stablemate Broome and was beaten eight lengths into second place after briefly leading two furlongs out. In the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial over the same course and distance two weeks later he kept on well in the straight without looking likely to win and finished third behind Broome and the Ballydoyle pacemaker Blenheim Palace. Sovereign was reunited with Beggy when he was one of seven O'Brien runners to contest the 2019 Epsom Derby and started a 50/1 outsider. Acting as a pacemaker for the stable's more highly regarded contenders, he went to the front and led the field into the straight before fading to come home tenth of the thirteen runners, just over nine lengths behind the winner Anthony Van Dyck. Sovereign was expected to fulfil a similar pacemaking role when he started at odds of 33/1 in an eight-runner field for the Irish Derby over one and a half miles at the Curragh on 29 June. Anthony Van Dyck started favourite ahead of Broome and the Epsom Derby runner-up Madhmoon while the other four runners were Rakan (King George V Cup), Norway (Zetland Stakes), Il Paradiso and Guaranteed. Beggy sent the colt to the front soon after the start, opened up a clear advantage at half way and increased his lead entering the straight. He never looked in the slightest danger of defeat in the closing stages and won \\"easily\\" by six lengths from Anthony Van Dyck. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Padraig was in front and he was comfortable and his horse kept coming. I'd say anytime that you make the running you have to get the fractions right, and he did. The Curragh is a big, open galloping track and he has a massive stride. The undulations at Epsom might not have suited him as much\\". He went on to mention the Grand Prix de Paris, King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes and St Leger as possible future targets. In September Aidan O'Brien announced that Sovereign would not race again in 2019, saying \\"He hasn't had a setback, we just want to give him time\\".

It was a direct response to the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War, a feud that had been going on between both countries for about two years.  Background  Decades before the Compromise, the Kingdom of Poland and the Teutonic Order were engaged in The Thirteen Years' War, where the Polish king had sided with Prussian rebels in order to fight the Teutons. Following a Teutonic defeat, Casimir IV Jagiellon forced them to agree to the Second Peace of Thorn, which reduced the amount of power the Order had, as well as annexing almost all of western Prusal (Prussia). This also gave the Polish control of Malbork, the former capital of the Teutonic Order. Fifty-three years later, and tensions were still high between the two eastern European powers. Around January 1519, Polish forces near Kolo attacked towards Eastern Prussia, and kick-started the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War. Both countries were near-equal in military power, causing the war to mostly be a standstill for its three-year duration. Nearing the end of the war, current Holy Roman Emperor Charles V called for both countries to cease their fighting, as the Ottoman Empire had invaded Hungary at this point.  Aftermath  Part of the Compromise required both countries to partake in a four-year truce, giving time for Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon to decide whether Albrecht, former and last leader of the Teutonic Knights, would have to do fealty and homage for Casimir. While no settlement was reached for the latter during that time, Albrecht continued to reach out for allies, most notably Martin Luther, who told Albrecht to abandon his Catholic ways and convert Prussia into a duchy. He agreed, converted to Lutheranism, and dropped out of most positions he was in that related to Catholicism. The old Teutonic Order lost the majority of their power in the region, and eventually Albrecht would become the duke of the Duchy of Prussia.

Founded as a high school by members of the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod in 1878, it added college courses in 1881. The English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States took over control of the school in 1893. Control passed to the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod when the English Synod merged with it in 1911. In April 1935, a fire destroyed the main building, and the school closed permanently at the end of the spring semester. Beginnings and high school In the 1870s, Catawba County, North Carolina, was a major center of the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod, with 70 congregations and a total of 10,000 members. Many of the congregations had shared church buildings with congregations of the Reformed church for decades, and many of the Lutheran families sent their children to Catawba High School, a Reformed institution in Newton. However, a well-attended debate between Methodist minister Daniel May and Lutheran pastor J. M. Smith on the topic \\"Is Christ's Body Present in the Lord's Supper?\\" on August 7 and 8, 1874, aroused the desire of the Lutheran populace to establish Lutheran education in the area. Efforts began that same year to establish a Lutheran high school. The Tennessee Synod agreed that the school should be established, but declined to offer any financial support. Lutheran pastor Polycarp Cyprian Henkel, a grandson of Paul Henkel, had in the years before the American Civil War advocated for a Lutheran school in the area. He had gone to Missouri to serve a group of Lutherans from North Carolina who had migrated there, but returned to his farm near Conover in April 1877 to further the establishment of the school. Three towns in Catawba County, namely, Conover, Hickory, and Newton, competed to be the site of the school. Conover was selected because its inhabitants had raised the most funds and offered a free site for the school. In addition, pastors Smith and Henkel both lived nearby, and the former had two sons of high school age. In appreciation for being selected, the people in Conover raised an additional $2,000. The Concordia High School Association was officially formed on August 18, 1877. The name Concordia was chosen because while in Missouri, Henkel had come in contact with C. F. W. Walther and the Saxon German immigrants who had formed the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States, known today as the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS). He was impressed with that synod's staunch adherence to the Lutheran Book of Concord and their frequent reference to it with the term Concordia. The first session of Concordia High School began in March 1878, with 19 pupils and R. A. Yoder as the sole teacher. Classes were held at Yoder's home while the Administration and Educational Building was constructed at a cost of $4,000. The two-story frame structure had a square cross floorplan, and included an attic and a cupola. The first floor contained an assembly hall, a library, and a classroom, while the second floor housed four classrooms and a storeroom. The building, which was completed in time for the fall term that year, was situated on a portion of the of donated land. In 1881, a two-story boys dormitory was completed. The dormitory had eight bedrooms on the second floor and eight study rooms on the first. Establishment of the college In 1881, the decision was made to add college courses for the preparation of Lutheran pastors. The North Carolina General Assembly passed an act of incorporation for the college in February 1881. After encountering difficulties raising the necessary funding, the association appealed to the Tennessee Synod for formal support. In return, the synod would be empowered to appoint the members of the college's board of trustees. At its annual session in October 1883, the Tennessee Synod agreed to the give its \\"fostering care, influence, and moral support\\", although ownership of the college remained with the association. Henkel was appointed the first president in 1881 and served until he resigned in 1885 due to health issues. Professor J. C. Moser replaced Henkel as president of the college, and the Tennessee Synod agreed to pay $800 a year to help replace what had been Henkel's voluntary contributions as president and professor. In 1886, the college held its first commencement ceremony, the only graduate being David Polycarp Wike. His class originally had thirteen members, but the others had transferred to more established colleges in the area. Beginning in about 1888, proposals to move the college to Hickory were discussed within the Tennessee Synod. Col. Walter W. Lenoir had offered land in Hickory to any group that would establish a Protestant college. In 1890, the faculty attempted to relocate the college, over the opposition of the association. Although the attempt was thwarted, most of the faculty resigned in order to establish Highland College, subsequently renamed Lenoir College and now known as Lenoir‚ÄìRhyne University, in Hickory. However, a clause in the faculty contracts required six months advance notice of resignation, so Concordia College was able to remain open, although the last two weeks of the 1891 spring semester, including final exams, had to be cancelled. In order to keep the school open, the school hired two alumni, Charles L. Coon and M. H. Yount, to teach during the 1891‚Äì1892 school year. In late 1891, the association appealed to the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States, which had been created as an offshoot of the Tennessee Synod, to provide replacement faculty and funding. William H. T. Dau was installed as president in May 1892. A graduate of Concordia Seminary of the LCMS in St. Louis, Missouri, Dau oversaw the linkage of the college with the seminary. The English Synod also supplied a second professor, G. A. Romoser. The 1893 convention of the English Synod formally took control the college as its own institution and appointed two additional professors, Charles L. Coon and L. Buchheimer, while at the same time urging that the Lutheran congregations in the area call their own pastors rather than relying on Dau and Romoser to fill those duties. It was also agreed that the college would provide a \\"full classical course\\" for men who would then attend Concordia Seminary in St. Louis or Concordia Theological Seminary in Sprngfield, Illinois, for theological training to become pastors. The college would also provide courses for men who could not attend one of those seminaries and who would become pastors upon graduation from Concordia College itself. Even after the college courses had been added, the school had continued to conduct elementary school classes for the Lutheran families in the area. The English Synod required the grade school classes to be run by and funded by the local congregations, as was the case elsewhere in the synod. This was accomplished by 1895. In 1911, the English Synod merged with the LCMS, and control of the English Synod's educational institutions, Concordia College and St. John's College, passed to the LCMS. Differences between the LCMS, which still used German in its colleges and seminaries, and local English-speaking supporters of Concordia College soon became apparent. The LCMS was focused on training young men to become pastors, while Lutherans in Catawba County wanted an institution that would also educate their sons and their daughters for secular careers. The LCMS initially discontinued the upper two grades from 1911 to 1916, reducing Concordia to a high school. However, by 1919, not only had college status been restored, but programs in such non-theological topics as French, \\"mental science\\", \\"moral science\\", and pedagogy were being offered. Fire and closure The status of Concordia College varied, depending on attendance, economic conditions, and war, from being the equivalent of a high school to being a junior college. Several times the synod considered merging its preparatory colleges to one location. In response to one such proposal in 1918, the local supporters of the college raised the funds to construct a girls' dormitory and a professor's house without any financial support from the synod. Total enrollment, including high school classes, peaked at about 100 students, but began declining due to the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, the LCMS created a committee to again investigate closing one or more of its three junior colleges. Early in the morning of April 16, 1935, a fire broke out in the Administration Building. Efforts to put out the fire were futile, although the piano and a number of books were rescued by the efforts of the faculty and neighbors. The building itself was destroyed. Initially the LCMS pledged $95,000, later increased to $105,000, to build a new fireproof building. However, no funds were ever actually appropriated. Instead, the synod decided to close the college rather than rebuild it because the LCMS itself was experiencing difficulties placing the pastors coming out of its seminaries with congregations that could afford to pay them. Classes for the remainder of the semester were conducted in the church building, dormitories, and various homes. The final commencement ceremony was held for the five high school and two college graduates. During its history, the college graduated 52 Lutheran pastors as well as a large number of local residents. In 1944, Concordia Lutheran Church, whose church building was located across the street from the school site, bought the campus from the LCMS for $5,000. The congregation had begun in 1878 as a group of Conover Lutherans worshiping in the assembly hall of the Administration Building. The congregation demolished the only remaining building on the campus, the boy's dormitory, and turned the campus into Concordia Park. Sunday evening drive-in \\"Open Air Gospel Services\\" were held in the park starting in 1947. In 1957, the congregation started construction in the park of its current church building; the structure was completed in 1958.

The Batonis Tsikhe complex contains surviving sections of the Persianate palace of the kings of Kakheti and a museum with archaeological and ethnographic exhibits, manuscripts, rare publications, and military equipment as well as a fine arts gallery. In 2007, several structures of the complex‚Äîthe palace, rampart, and a royal chapel‚Äîwere inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. The entire complex underwent extensive renovation in 2018.  The royal palace  = Construction and architectural features = Throne room in the Batonis Tsikhe palace. Royal chapels The original palace was built at the behest of King Archil of Kakheti sometime between 1664 and 1675. In the political turmoil of the 17th and 18th centuries, the palace was damaged and reconstructed several times. Some sections of the building and ground plan of Archil's palace‚Äîreminiscent of the contemporaneous Safavid palaces‚Äîremained intact. Much of the extant edifice is the result of reconstruction during the relatively stable reign of Heraclius II as king of Kakheti between 1750 and 1762. It is a simple Persianate design, clearly modeled on the Arg of Karim Khan in Shiraz, Iran. The entire palace complex, which also includes two royal basilica chapels and bathhouses, are surrounded by a monumental rampart and large circular corner towers. The palace is a rectangular building with a central hall with high ceilings and pointed arches. It has four balconies (ayvƒÅn) each facing a cardinal point and flanked by corridors and smaller rooms in the corners. The main entrance to the palace is from the south with the central two-story hall (tƒÅlƒÅr) with columns. Interior decorations typical for the Persian palaces of that period, such as stucco, mirror mosaics, and oil paintings, were probably present, but have not survived. = Later history = After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Major-General Vasily Gulyakov chose the Telavi castle as headquarters for his Kabarda Regiment in 1802. In 1805, the castle was transferred to the Russian Imperial treasury. It was later used by the Russian military as barracks and was mostly in ruins by 1845, when Mikhail Vorontsov, Viceroy of the Caucasus, ordered the palace to be rebuilt. In 1865, the Telavi palace, now in possession of St. Nino's Female Charity Society, was reconstructed by the Georgian-born German architect Albert Salzmann (1833‚Äì1897), to accommodate the Women's College of St. Nino. In 1935, the building was adapted to its current function as a home to the Telavi Historical Museum. The Batonis Tsikhe complex underwent extensive renovation and was reopened for public in May 2018. A new museum was also constructed to house renovated collections. On 16 December 2018, the castle hosted the inauguration ceremony for Salome Zourabichvili, the fifth President of Georgia.

She earned her doctorate in 1898, at the University of Zurich, being one of the first women to do so at that institution, and acquired in 1902, as the first woman, a Venia legendi at the Faculty of Arts of the same university. Her most famous work is a collection of Icelandic folk tales. Early life and education Adeline Rittershaus was born July 29, 1876, in Barmen (now part of the city of Wuppertal). She was a daughter of the poet Emil Rittershaus and grew up in Barmen in the Prussian Rhine Province. Ferdinand Freiligrath, a friend of her father, was her godfather. As women were unable to acquire an Abitur in Germany until 1899, Rittershaus received private preparation by teachers of Barmer Real Gymnasium in 1894, and passed the Matura exam in Z√ºrich. She then studied Germanic philology, Greek, and Sanskrit at the University of Zurich with, among others, Albert Bachmann. She earned her doctorate in 1898 as one of the first women at the University of Zurich, with research into Old Germanic dialects. She served as an aide of the political scientist, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann. In 1898, she traveled to Iceland for the first time for several months to study Icelandic language and literature. After her return to Zurich, she continued this work with the study of old and new Icelandic. During her second stay in Iceland, in 1899, Rittershaus met the Icelandic teacher Thorleifur Bjarnason and married him, but divorced one year later. In 1901, she submitted an application for admission to the Habilitation for Old and New Icelandic Language and Literature at the University of Bonn, which was rejected by 14 to 16 votes. In the magazine Frauencorrespondenz, on February 11 and 14, 1902, Rittershaus reported in detail on her experiences with the University of Bonn. Rittershaus and Countess Maria von Linden were the only women in Prussia until the end of the empire who had tried to obtain teaching permission at a university. At the State Library in Reykjav√≠k, Rittershaus researched Icelandic fairy tales collected in the last century. From this activity, she developed important contributions to comparative fairy tale research. After rejecting her earlier habilitation petition, Ritterhaus succeeded at the University of Zurich in 1902 with her publication, Die neuisl√§ndischen Volksm√§rchen (The New Icelandic Folk Tales). Her late work, entitled Altnordische Frauen (Old Norse Women) is a popular scientific publication, developed from the saga seal portrait of women during the Viking Age. In 1904, she married the Zurich architect, Theodor Oberl√§nder. This marriage ended in divorce in 1919, which greatly increased the social pressure on her. Due to serious illness, she resigned on May 21, 1920 from the faculty of the University of Zurich. Rittershaus died on September 6, 1924 in Berlin.

The novel is set in the time of Jesus. Reception Reviewing Lazarus for The Guardian, novelist Peter Stanford called it \\"a brave and engaging novel... a page- turner. I simply had to keep going to the very end in order to know on earth what would happen.\\" In her article in The Jewish Week, Sandee Brawarsky observed that \\"Zimler‚Äôs writing is richly detailed, his characters compelling. Even if readers know how this story will unfold, there are surprising turns in these pages.\\" In his Tikkun review, Jacob Staub wrote that \\"Zimler is masterful at immersing his readers in the ambience and symbols of each period, in the alleyways and culinary scents of each of his settings, so that the human lessons he elicits are credible and grounded in the past. He views Jewish history as a sacred text\\". Plot The novel tells the story of Lazarus of Bethany from his own point of view. One of the author's goals was to return to Lazarus and Jesus their Judaism and, in consequence, both men are referred to by their Hebrew names: Yeshua ben Yosef and Eliezer ben Natan. The book presents Yeshua ben Yosef as an early Jewish mystic and explores the deep friendship between Eliezer and Yeshua, who - within the fictional setting - have been best friends since childhood. Antisemitic shunning In June 2019 Zimler published an essay in the Guardian entitled, \\"I have never met antisemitism in Britain... until now.\\" It explained how Zimler, a highly acclaimed, bestselling novelist, had been rejected for appearances by two cultural organizations after they inquired whether he \\"was Jewish.\\" He concluded the essay by writing, \\"if you fail to be welcoming to Jewish writers and artists because you fear a backlash, then your cowardice makes it possible for the haters to have their way ‚Äì to spread their irrational dislike of Jews and make shunning them seem acceptable. Is that really the 'new normal' you want for Great Britain?\\" According to The Bookseller, a trade publication that covers the British publishing industry, both The Observer and The Guardian confirmed that the arts organizations had decided not to sponsor appearances by Zimler after confirming that he is Jewish. The organizations feared that would suffer from a backlash if they sponsored a talk by a Jewish writer.

Wible is based in Eugene, Oregon. Biography =Early life= Pamela Laine Wible was born in 1967 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to physician parents: her mother is a psychiatrist and her father was a pathologist. She spent time growing up both in Philadelphia as well as in rural Texas. She would accompany her father in his work in the morgue, and she spent time visiting state mental hospitals with her mother. =Education= Pamela Wible attended Wellesley College (in Wellesley, Massachusetts) as an undergraduate and then received her MD degree in 1993 from the medical school of the University of Texas Medical Branch (in Galveston, Texas). In 1996 she completed her training in Family Medicine at the University of Arizona Department of Family and Community Medicine. Medical career Upon completing her medical training, Wible worked for several years in a variety of medical settings, including hospital-based clinics and community health centers. Wible began to experience suicidal ideation due to depression and pressures related to her job when she became increasingly frustrated with short patient-appointments and other restrictions, and so she stopped her work in the year 2004, and then in 2005 she held a series of \\"town hall\\" meetings where she invited community members to write out what they felt would be the features of an \\"ideal clinic.\\" In the same year Wible opened up a new clinic in the city of Eugene, Oregon which was based on the recommendations from the community. She has also helped do a similar town-hall feedback session with a hospital in Chippewa Valley in 2010. Wible's clinic includes same-day appointments, appointments that start on time and a smaller practice size. She also emphasizes \\"patient-focused medicine.\\" The change in her practice helped her enjoy her work as a physician again. Wible has set up an anonymous suicide prevention hotline to help doctors and medical students who are contemplating suicide. She also collects stories of doctor suicides as a way of raising awareness of the problem. Wible's work on doctor suicide prevention is featured in the documentary film Do No Harm: Exposing the Hippocratic Hoax, by filmmaker Robyn Symon. In 2015, she spoke at TEDMED about the problem of suicide in the medical profession. Wible also has a blog called Ideal Medical Care which shares physician's stories of their treatment while being trained and also stories of suicides by physicians and trainees.

To this end it is fast, aerobatic and equipped with standard military instrumentation. Only three were built. Design and development The WLM-1 is a high wing glider. It has an all-wood structure and, with the exception of the rudder, is entirely plywood covered. In plan the wing has straight taper out to rounded tips, with an unswept leading edge, and is built around two spars. It has a thin section with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 13% at the root, reducing to 7% at the tip, and is set with 1.5¬∞ of dihedral. Slotted ailerons occupy about half the trailing edges and inboard slotted flaps the rest. The flaps can be set to deflections of 0¬∞, 10¬∞ or 40¬∞ for fast gliding, soaring and landing respectively. When the flaps are down, the ailerons are lowered together by half the flap deflection. DFS-type metal spoilers, which open above and below the wing and can be used to limit speed to the allowed maximum, are mounted behind the rear spar at 68% chord. The WLM-1 has a ply-covered, oval section, semi-monocoque fuselage. The cockpit is its most unusual feature, with the pilot on raised seating under a fighter-style bubble canopy with three separate, unbroken transparencies. The windscreen and aft parts, the latter reaching back above the wing almost to the rear spar, are fixed and the central hood removable; the resulting all-round view is exceptional. The cockpit is richly instrumented by glider standards to familiarize pilots with the standard fighter layout. The WLM-1's tail is conventional, with a short fin carrying a full, rounded, fabric-covered balanced rudder. Only its edges and balance are ply-covered. A narrow, triangular tailplane is mounted on the base of the fin and carries semi-elliptical plan elevators with large cut-outs for rudder movement. The glider's landing gear is also conventional, with a rubber-sprung forward skid and a tail-bumper on the extreme rear fuselage. The WLM-1 first flew on 21 July 1947 from Lupfig. Sx months of rigorous testing followed, piloted by Rolf Isler. These included flutter tests at up to , tows up to and a vertical dive from during which spoilers held the speed to . Operational history Though the Swiss Air Force had originally considered purchasing twelve WLM-1s, only three were built. They all competed in the 1948 World Gliding Championships, held in Samedan but did not excel. Their freedom from flutter at speed was noted but also their inability to exploit weak lift as well as several other competitors. The first WLM-1 crashed in the spring of 1949 but the two survivors were used to prepare pilots for the SAF's de Havilland Vampires between 1949 and 1952; in 1953 the SAF began to receive two-seat Vampire trainers, making the WLM-1s redundant. The second example remained active until 1969, when it was lost in a spin at the end of a series of aerobatic manoeuvres. The last example, HB-552, now belongs to the Air Force Museum \\"Clin d'Ailes\\" in Payerne. After a comprehensive restoration it remains active in 2019.

The church is administered by the religious order Knights of the Cross with the Red Star and the administrator is P. Luk√°≈° Lipensk√Ω O.Cr.  History  = Romanesque Basilica = The basilica was built in the second half of the 12th century under the reign of King Vratislaus I.. It was a parish church for the German community of the extinct village Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠.  Owners of the church  Around the year 1200, the Margrave of Moravian, Vladislav Henry, gave the church to the Teutonic order, which founded a hospital and also its residency there. After the death of a husband, Ottokar I of Bohemia, Constance of Hungary decided to establish a woman's Cistercian monastery, so she bought the church, hospital and surrounding fields from the Teutonic order that moved to the church of Sts. Benedict nearby. However, the woman's Cistercian Monastery was founded near Ti≈°nov. Constance of Hungary donated the church with properties to the hospital of St. Francis which was founded by her daughter Agnes in the same year. The original brotherhood hospital has gradually become into the new Czech church order Knights of the Cross with the Red Star which has continued to provide worships there to this day.  Description  alt= The Romanesque basilica had a frontage with two towers (which are preserved to this day) in the west part of the church, there was also a tribune between towers. The original Romanesque portal was already demolished in the 15th century, as well as smaller windows on the 4th and 5th floors of the tower. The window from the tribune has come down to this day. The main nave was not vaulted but was connected to the tribune. The church was ended with an almost squared choir which consisted of a presbytery and a semicircular apse.  Nave  Aisles were opened with three arcades supported by parallelepiped pillars that grew out of the broader plinths with corniced head, culminating with similar cornice capitals. Two of the southern row of pillars have come down to this day. Both aisles were covered with a groin vault and were closed by a straight wall on the western side. The basilica's walls were 1 meter thick and were made from stones, which were put on lime mortar. The walls were decorated with paintings and the remains of them are still visible in the segmental arches of the windows. The construction was completed in the second half of the 12th century. After the floods in 1280, there was built a mass grave near the church, which was later replaced with a regular graveyard. In the beginning of the 14th century there was built a parish school which belonged to the church. = Gothic Reconstruction = The Gothic reconstruction and extension began in 1382. The northern Romanesque nave was demolished and it was replaced by a Gothic two-aisles construction whereas the southern nave of the double nave copied the ground plan of the original northern Romanesque one. The construction was completed in 1395. However, the Romanesque presbytery did not fit into the new configuration of the church therefore the preparation for the new one began. It was completed in 1406 - the new presbytery was five-sided and two-times wider than the previous Romanesque presbytery, and it occupied the main Romanesque nave and also the southern Gothic aisle. Regardless, the church looked strange because the new presbytery did not follow the main Romanesque nave and the southern Gothic one. That is probably reason, why another rebuilding began. During the remodeling of the temple was pulled down the main Romanesque nave and southern Gothic nave and instead of them was constructed a new massive Gothic nave. The South Romanesque nave has been kept. The reconstruction finished around 1411. alt= = Hussite period = In 1414, during the Hussite period, the Knights' pastor Nicholas implemented a unique method of holy communion which was adding to normal Catholic communion at the main altar, this communion contained delivery of the wine and bread (communion under both kinds) to preyers at side altars. In 1419, after the battle, the Hussites evicted the Knights of the church and the pastor Nicholas avoided a lapidation just in time. The church itself was not destroyed, because of its previous communion in the Protestants way. The Knights returned in 1436, and then George of Podƒõbrady reinstated the hussite priest.  Second half of the 15th century  Another reconstruction was planned. The southern Romanesque nave was dismantled (two columns were preserved to this day) and replaced with a new, two-times wider Gothic nave. The two towers were also rebuilt into Gothic style - the existing Romanesque windows were replaced with new large Gothic ones. The changes also intervened the entrance portals - the western one was rebuilt and a new one was created in the south side. A new chapel arose between the northern Romanesque tower and the northern nave (now used as a confessional). The rooftops were covered with slates. Because of that, the church gained a new look, and the rebuilding was completed around 1500. A tin plate baptismal font with a dated inscription was procured in 1544 and a Gothic bell tower was added to the church in 1598. = Thirty Years' War and other catastrophes =  The 17th century  After the Battle of White Mountain, the last non Catholic priest, Lutheran Stephan, was exiled from the church and the church was taken care of by the New Town Council. The church was returned to the Knights in 1628. During the Thirty Years' War in 1632, the town was shortly controlled by the Saxons and Lutheran Stephan became temporarily the parish priest again. The church was destroyed during the siege by the Swedish in 1648. For the brave defense of Prague King Ferdinand III. the Habsburg took the church from the Knights and gave it to the New Town Council. The church suffered from an extensive fire and after that it was repaired and newly paved by charges from the New Town Council in 1653. The tower was hit by lightning and afterwards damaged by subsequent fire in 1666 and the church and its surroundings were hit by a great fire in 1680. The roof of the main nave and the turrets burned down and also the chapel in the cemetery, the full ossuary, the clergy house, and the steeple, where all three bells melted. The church was left in a bad condition after the fire because the New Town Council did not have money to repair it. in 1686, the council closed a deal with the Knights to whom they returned the church. A long repair of the church began, which was also financed by the Knights (the Prague Archbishop, the Knight John Frederic of Waldstein, also contributed) and a new roof was built. A smaller conflagration affected the belfry in 1689. During the another repair, the belfry's roof gets its characteristic Baroque rooftop.  The 18th century  There were installed new benches (which are kept to this day) in 1700. On eighth of February in 1702, Strahov abbot and bishop Vit Seipel consecrated the restored main altar of St. Peter, where a painting by Wenzel Lorenz Reiner was later delivered. One year later, cracked vaults were repaired, threatening to collapse from the fire in 1680. The Prussians damaged the church in 1757. Along with the repair of the damaged parts, the interior was partly change into baroque style - the choir loft was rebuilt, and the entire space in the middle of the towers. The church was paved with marble and the baroque plaster was used for the walls. These adjustments were made during 1760-61.  Alters  At that time, there were already seven altars - the main St. Peter, St. Charles Borromeo, St. John of Nepomuk, St. Anna, St. Barbara, the altar of Christ's wounds, and the Soul's altar. Another altars were added during the first half of the 18th century - the restored St. Mary Magdalene, St. Lazarus, St. Florian with a painting by John Peter Molitor and two other \\"private\\" altars. The main altar of st. Peter was enhanced with carvings of angels from the workshop of Matthias Bernard Braun in 1725. = Romanesque and Gothic Revival = In the years 1874‚Äì1879 with expenses from the New Town council, the church was completely rebuilt and repaired by the architect Josef Mocker, who puristically reconstructed it. alt=  Exterior  In the beginning, the Baroque plaster was removed and the church showed its stones. After that it was decided to the demolition - the baroque shield of the main nave, including the portal, were demolished and five supporting pillars were met by the same fate. They were rebuilt with a new plinth, as well as new pseudo-Gothic portals on the south, north and west sides. The new main portal was decorated with the Gothic Revial tympanum of Christ and St. Peter by Lewis ≈†imek, and also with a Czech and Prague emblem next to it. The crown of the southern and northern nave was raised, as well as the sacristy and the northwestern chapel. The church also received new roofs and on the north side was added a chimney with a modern sculpture. The windows were also touched with big changes, some were walled up, others were taken down and others (especially Baroque ones) rebuilt.  Interior  The Baroque and Renaissance plastering disappeared in the interior, the windows were replaced with new ones from Neuhauser company. There were also placed new benches (not all) and a confessional. The change influenced even the altars, leaving only six out of the original twelve altars. The Baroque balustrade of the choir loft remained preserved and the emblem of the New Town of Prague was inserted to its center. The whole expensive constructions and reconstructions were completed in 1885. = The 20th century = During the reconstruction of the church in 1913 ‚Äì1914, a thorough archaeological and building historical research began. The rudiments of the Romanesque basilica were mainly discovered, and also other Romanesque and Gothic elements. After the research a new interior repair started with restoration of altar paintings during 1929 -1936. That brought other new Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival elements to the church. However, this time they were placed only to places where they have been proven in the past. The church was confiscated from the Knights again after 1948 and was returned after 1989. Another major revision was in 1989‚Äì1991. A paving in a part of the church collapsed after the floods in 2002.  Architectural description  East Frontage The original building was a Romanesque basilica which was reconstructed many times and today's church is mainly in Gothic style with Romanesque elements. = Exterior = The church is composed of three-aisles with two towers. The walls are thick up to one meter and the masonry is made out of marble. Almost every side of the church (not the west side) has supporting pillars, which end at the same level as a cornice above windows. The church has three entrances, on the west, north and south sides. The western frontage is mainly Romanesque. The main portal is decorated with a tympanum with Jesus with St. Peter. On the sides of the portal is a Czech and Prague's emblem. = Interior = The church galleries are separated by arcades. A strip of smaller windows is situated above the arcades. The ceiling of the church consists of a Gothic groin vault, which goes into corbels. The floor is lined with marble. The presbytery has seven gothic windows, but one which faces to the main altar, is walled up. On the north side of the church there are windows with stained glass. Stained glass windows from the rest of the sides were replaced with pseudo-gothic monochrome glass. The presbytery ends with a semicircular apse with a sacristy. A pulpit is on the left side of the presbytery. The benches are situated in the main nave and the pipe organ stands in a choir loft in the western part of the church . alt=  The clergy house at St. Peter in Prague  The Renaissance Revial building of the clergy house No. 1137 in New Town, Prague 1, Biskupsk√° Street 13 is a part of the church. The clergy house was built in 1893 according to the project of the structural bureau, which was prepared by the constructor Constantine Mr√°ƒçek. The facade was designed by a significant Czech architect of the 19th century, Antonin Wiehl. The author of the sgraffito designs on the facade is Celda Klouƒçek, and according to his design it was made by Ladislav Nov√°k. The house is listed in the Central List of Cultural Monuments. The facade of the clergy house is ended with a lunette cornice, and lunettes are decorated with sgraffito which they are derived from the Schwarzenberg Palace. In the brickwork of the facade is sgraffito plaster, architectural elements out of sandstone and on the first floor there is a medallion with the year 1894. On the ground floor there are shields with the signs of the New Town and the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star that are used as a decorative element. The emblem of the Crusaders reminds us that \\"Now the parish priest of the parish priest after Fr. ≈†tolsk√Ω is Josef Christ, a priest of the Order of the Cross with the Red Star. The new glergy house in the street Biskupks√° No. 13 was built by the architect Ant. Wiehl; the facade is decorated by C.

Durwood (August 5, 1920 - July 14, 1999) was a businessman and philanthropist born in Kansas City to Edward D. and Celia T. Durwood. He is known for building the first multiplex movie theater in the 1960s.  Biography  Durwood attended Harvard University, and served as a navigator in the Army Air Forces in World War II, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. He had an uncanny ability to remember the birthday of nearly everyone he met, and did one-handed push ups into his 70s. He was awarded the 1989 Salah M. Hassanein Humanitarian Award and the Vision Fund of America's 1989 Man of the Year Award.He died at age 78 on July 14, 1999.  AMC Theaters  In 1920, Durwood's father and uncles, Edward, Barney, and Maurice Dubinsky, bought a Kansas City movie theater which they called Regent Theater. The brothers built up the theatre chain over the next decade; by 1932 the company owned 40 theaters in Missouri and Kansas. Stanley started working with the brothers officially by 1945. When Edward (who had changed his surname to Durwood), Stanley's father, passed away in 1960, Stanley took over Durwood Theaters, Inc. The 1960s were a time of changing consumer demands in the world of movie theaters, as televisions started to work their way into individual's homes. Durwood's 600 seat Roxy theater in downtown Kansas City had such low attendance that Durwood had to close off the balcony so the business would not have to cover the expense of the usher. Soon, Durwood dreamed up a solution: in 1963, Durwood opened what is believed to be the first theater designed to be a multiplex. The business model allowed theaters to attract more customers with a variety of titles. Soon, the number of screens had grown to more than two dozen in some cities. In 1968, Durwood changed the company name to connect it to the multiplex: Durwood Theatres became the American Multi-Cinema. Durwood kept innovating beyond the multiplex, as well. He is widely credited with the idea of arm rest cup holders and stadium-style seating in theaters. At his death in July 1999, AMC was the fourth-largest movie exhibition company in the world.  Involvement in Kansas City Community  Durwood grew up in Kansas City, where he graduated from Pembroke-Country Day School. He wanted to see the city revitalized and worked to get people back to the urban core. He was central in the plans for the Power & Light District. His company \\"invested in Power & Light with no assurance of a return.\\" Durwood described \\"an elevated train that would transport visitors to the Power & Light District from the Country Club Plaza. He also suggested that eight Midwestern states should be merged into one, with Kansas City as its seat of government. Colleagues said such grand visions were vintage Durwood - a blend of business practicality with a twist of the seemingly impossible. He was a member of the Pembroke Hill Alumni Association and the Harvard Radcliffe Club of Kansas City.He was a founding member of Downtown, Inc., presently known as the Downtown Council.After Durwood passed away from esophageal cancer in 1999, the Stanley H. Durwood Foundation (better known as the Durwood Foundation) was established to help fund early childhood education programs in the Kansas City Area. Raymond E. Beagle, Jr. and Charles J. Egan Jr. were the co-trustees of the Durwood Foundation at the time of establishment. As of March 2019, it had made more than $40 million grants. UMKC's Stanley H. Durwood soccer stadium was named in his honor, as was the film vault at the Kansas City Central Library. The Kansas City Council, recognizing Durwood, Kansas City entrepreneuer and legend of the theatrical exhibition industry, declared July 23, 1999 as \\"Stan Durwood Day\\" in Kansas City.

It was developed by Bruce Artwick for the Apple II, then ported to the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and IBM PC (as a self-booting disk which does not use MS-DOS).  Gameplay  Night Mission Pinball simulates a pinball machine. Players can tweak dozens of settings in the simulator, including the number of balls in play, velocity of the balls, strength of the flippers, sensitivity to tilting, bounciness of the surfaces, and gravitational force exerted on the balls. Up to four players can compete for a high score. The Atari version uses high resolution monochrome graphics.  Release  The game was initially marketed as A2-PB1 Pinball and subtitled \\"Night Mission\\". The Apple version was released in May 1982. The Commodore 64 version was released in late 1983.  Reception  Robert C. Gray of SoftSide wrote that the IBM PC version's configurability changes pinball from being a game of chance to \\"a game of intellectual choice\\". In a PC Magazine review, Corey Sandler called it \\"a strange combination of game and graduate physics lesson\\" that could have appeal to tinkerers and those who wish to learn how physics impacts game design. Softline highlighted the Apple version's tweakability as having \\"a modest educational purpose\\" and making it \\"a programmer's tour de force\\". Some reviewers compared it to other arcade games released around the same time. John J. Anderson of Video & Arcade Games called the Atari version's realism \\"obsessive\\" and praised its configurability, even though one can not design one's own pinball machine, as in the Pinball Construction Set. Computer Games Magazine rated it A+ and called it \\"the best computerized pinball game\\", as it has some features missing from the PCS, such as a \\"tilt\\" mechanic. Comparing it to Raster Blaster and David's Midnight Magic, Computer Gaming Worlds reviewers determined that Night Mission had the best ball physics and fastest balls, making it the best choice. Rick Teverbaugh of Electronic Games called it \\"easily the most complex\\" of the pinball games released in 1983.

The event was held as part of the 2018 US demonstrations against gun violence.  Conception  An aerial view of Scotts Ridge Middle School (closer) and Ridgefield High School (farther), which share the same campus. The National School Walkout organizers attended RHS. After the shooting in Parkland, student Lane Murdock uploaded a petition to change.org, asking people to protest the lack of responses that follow school shootings in America by participating in a walkout. The petition accumulated over 270,000 signatures. Murdock and fellow Ridgefield High School students Paul Kim, Max Cumming, and Grant Yaun partnered with Indivisible to successfully rollout the effort. The NationalSchoolWalkout Twitter accumulated more than 100,000 followers in five days. National School Walkout scheduled the nation wide walkout to take place on April 20, as it marked the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High school shooting. The official color for The National School Walkout was orange, as a nod to the color hunters wear to distinguish fellow hunters from animals.  Event  The walkout took place at 10 o‚Äôclock in the morning in each local time zone. When students headed outside, they participated in 13 seconds of silence to honour the 13 people killed at Columbine High School. Many walkouts consisted of the incorporation of open mics, to guest speakers and even voter registration sections; where senior students that were eligible, registered to vote. Some students also wrote letters to students from other school communities that have been impacted by school shootings, whereas others decided to set booths where students could call their representatives to pressure lawmakers over gun control. The April 20 walkout organized by Murdock was set to last until the end of the school day, because the issue is one that needed to be ‚Äòaddressed [for] longer than 17 minutes‚Äô. This was said in reference to the March 14 walkout, which lasted for 17 minutes to mark the 17 lives lost at the Marjory Stone High School shooting, after which students returned to their classrooms.  Response  Students partaking in the National School Walkout in Washington DC on April 20. Image attributed to: SLOWKING Murdock‚Äôs plan to hold a school walkout met much criticism from different groups of people, ranging from students and staff from Columbine High school to educators of various schools and even government branches of education from different states across the country. The backlash was largely due to uncertainty about the purpose of the walkout, as well as its overlap with many standardized student exams. National School Walkout occurred on the anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting, but faced criticism from students, alumni and staff from the high school. It was custom for classes to be cancelled on April 24 for Columbine High School students in honor of those who passed during the shooting to allow students to engage in community service. Many members from the school community expressed their dislike of the walkout being held on that day and made it clear that they did not support it. The principal from Columbine High School, Scott Christy, wrote a letter addressed to students from different high schools near the area; prompting them to partake in community service in lieu of participating in a walkout. The letter read, \\"Please consider planning service projects, an activity that will somehow build up your school . . . as opposed to a walkout.‚Äù The New York City Department of Education announced that students who were absent from school due to the walkout would be marked with an unexcused absence. Other schools across the country also placed restrictions on students's ability to participate. This led to some students holding alternative events after school. However, other schools compromised with students holding demonstrations before, or after school or permitting them to attend walkouts, if they had a parental note. Parkland Students organized their own walkout in their community. The morning of the nationwide walkout, news broke that one person was injured in a shooting at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida. This led to some students cancelling their planned walkouts, but also energized others, such as David Hogg, who expressed in a video posted on his social media that the event reiterated the necessity of the walkout. American students at the tertiary level also took part in demonstrations to show their support for the National School Walkout. Harvard Students also partook in the walkout, placing particular emphasis on emphasising the rights of minority groups. American students at Oxford and Cambridge universities in England also participated in walkouts to show support to students back in the United States and call for gun control.

He was involved with running the Windsor City Hockey League, assisted in the foundation of the Windsor Softball League, and later started a junior ice hockey league in Windsor, Ontario. He was a cofounder of the International Hockey League in 1945, and founder of the original Windsor Spitfires junior team in 1946. He served as president of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1961 to 1963, welcomed the Montreal Junior Canadiens into the OHA when it was divided by the Metro Junior A League, and supported measures to preserve the Northern Ontario Hockey Association. He served four years as a vice-president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1964 to 1968, and was its president in 1968. He oversaw international tours between the Canadian and Soviet national teams, and arbitrated disputes in Memorial Cup competition as vice-president. He served as the CAHA president at a time when the Western Canada Hockey League left the CAHA jurisdiction and joined the rival Canadian Hockey Association over disputes on the age limit of junior players. He resigned in 1968 for business reasons, and regretted becoming CAHA president at a critical time. He was inducted into Windsor / Essex County Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. Early life Lloyd Thompson Pollock was born on July 26, 1909 in Pine River, Ontario. He moved to Windsor, Ontario in 1933, and began working for the Canadian Pacific Railway as a cashier. In the early 1930s he became involved with the Windsor City Hockey League and became its secretary-treasurer, and was also involved in the foundation of the Windsor Softball League. Windsor hockey alt=Windsor Arena exterior Pollock was involved in establishing a junior ice hockey league for the 1942‚Äì43 season in Windsor. The league competed at the Junior B-level in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), with the ultimate goal of obtaining a Junior A-level team in Windsor. On December 5, 1945 at the Norton Palmer Hotel in Windsor, Pollock was one of the eight attendees of the inaugural meeting which founded the International Hockey League (IHL), which included Jack Adams and Fred Huber both of the Detroit Red Wings. The league began operations in the 1945‚Äì46 season with teams in Windsor and Detroit, and operated as semi-professional league. Pollock served as general manager of the Windsor Hettche Spitfires in the IHL, which acted as a farm team for the Detroit Red Wings. Pollock's goal of a Junior A-level team in Windsor was realized in 1946, when he established the original Windsor Spitfires for the 1946‚Äì47 OHA season. He and business partner Jack Dent obtained franchise rights from the OHA for C$500, and purchased uniform for another $100. The team lost its first game 15-0 to the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, but attracted a crowd of 4,062 spectators at the Windsor Arena. Pollock served as the team's general manager. The original Spitfires operated in the OHA from 1946 to 1953, were coached by Jimmy Skinner, and reached the J. Ross Robertson Cup final during the 1947‚Äì48 OHA season. Pollock convinced the Detroit Red Wings to relocate prospect players from the Galt Red Wings to Windsor in 1947. The team produced several future star players for Detroit, including Glenn Hall, Marcel Pronovost, Earl Reibel, Johnny Wilson, and Glen Skov. The team was sold in 1953, and relocated to become the Hamilton Tiger Cubs.Simcoe Reformer. February 11, 1975. Page 4. Ontario hockey alt=Photo of trophy Pollock moved up to provincial level hockey in 1952 and served on the OHA executive committee until 1963. During this time, he acted as a convenor for OHA and Allan Cup playoffs. During the 1956 Allan Cup tournament, Pollock commented on the rising salaries in hockey. He felt that players were overpaid and stated that team budgets should correspond to attendance figures and ticket sales. As an OHA convenor in 1960, he ruled that the Kitchener- Waterloo Dutchmen missed the final playoff berth in the OHA standings based on goals, despite protests by the team which represented Canada in ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics. Pollock was elected president of the OHA in 1961 and served as its leader until 1963. In 1961, Pollock was faced with the junior teams based in Toronto splitting off into the Metro Junior A League, which left the OHA's junior division with only five teams. In August that year, Pollock applied to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) to permit the Montreal Junior Canadiens from the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association to play in the OHA as its sixth team. The request was denied by CAHA president Jack Roxburgh, who stated that CAHA rules do not allow en masse transfers between provincial associations. Pollock briefly considered operating the OHA outside of the CAHA's jurisdiction but decided against doing so. The proposal for the Canadiens to play in the OHA's junior division was later approved in September 1961, when the CAHA branch presidents voted in its favour. An agreement was also reached that saw the OHA junior champion play the Metro Junior A League champion during the Memorial Cup playoffs. In November 1962, the Metro Junior A League began its second season separated from the OHA. Pollock stated a continued desire to have only one Junior-A league in Ontario and to reunite the teams under the OHA's jurisdiction. He also spoke out against players under the age of 16 being asked to move away from home to play hockey. At the same time, the OHA introduced rules to make hockey helmets mandatory as of January 1, 1963, for all players except goaltenders in midget age groups and younger. In May 1963, the Northern Ontario Hockey Association applied to the CAHA to become an equal branch to the OHA. When the request was denied by the CAHA, Pollock stated that measures needed to be put in place to prevent the migration of players southwards to the more populated OHA, and preserve the leagues in Northern Ontario. Canadian hockey =CAHA 2nd vice-president= alt=Photo of trophy Pollock was elected the second vice- president of the CAHA, on May 23, 1964, serving under Lionel Fleury as president. Pollock sat on the CAHA committee to reevaluate the existing development agreement with the National Hockey League (NHL), in an attempt to have amateur hockey be more independent from professional influence. He also oversaw the Soviet Union national ice hockey team's tour through Toronto, in December 1964. In March 1965, the CAHA submitted a bid to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for hosting duties of the 1967 World Ice Hockey Championships, but the IIHF ultimately chose Austria instead. Pollock reacted by saying, \\"possibly we should consider now whether or not its worth\\" going to future championships, in response to the IIHF disregarding the Canadian Centennial request. Pollock was reelected as the second vice-president of the CAHA on May 28, 1965. He oversaw the Soviet Union national ice hockey team's 1965 tour, which included games against the Canada men's national ice hockey team, Montreal Junior Canadiens, and Toronto Marlboros. In January 1966, Pollock chaperoned the Sherbrooke Beavers exhibition tour of Europe, and the 1965 Allan Cup champions. When reports surfaced from the media in Moscow that Canadian diplomat Robert Ford had admonished the team for rough play, Pollock denied the reports as untrue. Later in January, the CAHA terminated the working agreement with Amateur Hockey Association of the United States, in favour of negotiating new terms. Pollock said that the decision was due to professional leagues in both countries violating the principles of the agreement by assigning players to IHL and the Eastern Hockey League. He also said American professional teams were supplementing rosters by taking advantage of a 10-day period to negotiate a player transfer, and using the player in games without completing the transfer. Pollock was placed in charge of the 1966 Memorial Cup which included multiple protests and disagreements between the Edmonton Oil Kings and the Oshawa Generals. A Canadian Press release published on May 13, 1966, credited him for keeping the peace and being unflappable. He was quoted as saying \\"a big stick can be just as effective as a soft-sell\\", after he rejected protests from both Wren Blair of Oshawa, and Bill Hunter of Edmonton, for both managers not knowing the regulations. During the series, Hunter made newspaper headlines when he stated his vision for a nation-wide junior ice hockey league competing for the Memorial Cup. Pollock responded by saying that the idea would be nothing more than a pipe dream, and would not be feasible while the CAHA was renegotiating an agreement with professional leagues. After the conclusion of the series, Pollock announced a $40,000 profit in ticket sales due to playing all of the games at Maple Leaf Gardens, and that the CAHA received 25% of revenue from television broadcasts of the games which would benefit junior hockey. =CAHA 1st vice-president= Pollock was elected the first vice-president of the CAHA, on May 28, 1966, serving for two years under Fred Page as president. On August 19, 1966, the CAHA announced a new professional-amateur agreement with the NHL, that Pollock had assisted in negotiating. Under the tentative agreement effective July 1, 1967, direct sponsorship of junior teams by the NHL was to be phased out, the CAHA gained control over the development fees paid by the NHL, and junior players became eligible for the NHL Entry Draft at age 20. The CAHA faced a revolt from teams in Western Canada that disagreed with the age limit changing from 21 to 20. The breakaway teams formed the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League (CMJHL), and Pollock and fellow CAHA executives were unsuccessful in negotiations during the league's first season to resolve the age limit dispute. The CMJHL began legal action against the CAHA executive in March 1967, since the CAHA had suspended CMJHL teams and ruled the teams ineligible for the Memorial Cup playoffs. In May 1967, the CMJHL renamed itself to the Western Canada Junior Hockey League (WCJHL). In his second year as the first vice-president, the CAHA was awarded hosting duties for the A-pool of the 1970 World Ice Hockey Championships. Pollock was part of the executive committee which decided on which Canadian cities would host games in the tournament. The CAHA and the WCJHL reached an agreement for its western teams to compete for the 1968 Memorial Cup, and Pollock was put in charge of the schedule between the Niagara Falls Flyers and the Estevan Bruins. He chose to schedule a game at the Montreal Forum to increase profits for CAHA, due to the smaller size of the Flyers' Niagara Falls Memorial Arena, and Maple Leaf Gardens not being available. Pollock and Fred Page chose to hold a special meeting with the CAHA executive and the CAHA branch presidents in advance of the upcoming general meeting. Pollock summarized the meeting as reiterating the CAHA stance on the change of age limit for junior players due to the new agreement with the NHL, despite pending motions from delegates in the OHA and the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association to raise the age limit. =CAHA president= alt=Chatham-Kent VIA station Pollock was elected president of the CAHA at its general meeting in May 1968. Later that month, Bill Hunter of the WCJHL announced the league would use an age limit of 21 in defiance of the CAHA and NHL agreement. The WCJHL stopped short of declaring independence from the CAHA, and claimed that the lower age limit would decrease its talent pool and negatively affect ticket sales. In response, Pollock was quoted as saying that if the higher age was used, the league and its players would be suspended by the CAHA and not be allowed to transfer to other CAHA teams in good standing. A week later in a telephone interview, Pollock said that he wanted to avoid repeating the mistake of suspending those involved with the WCJHL age limit issue. He felt the previous suspensions were premature, as they did not stop the teams from playing. He also said that his stand on suspensions was misunderstood a week before. He said that players would not likely be released just to play outside the CAHA, and would be suspended for doing so; and that teams which played outside of the CAHA would lose their annual subsidy, and be ineligible for the Memorial Cup playoffs. On June 10, 1968, the WCJHL announced a name change to the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), and that it was leaving the CAHA to affiliate with the rival Canadian Hockey Association (CHA). The WCHL and the CHA were led by Ron Butlin as president of both association and league. Prior to the separation, Pollock had called for meetings to discuss a new junior playoff format, but with fewer teams under its jurisdiction the CAHA decided to allow those remaining to continue playing for the Memorial Cup. Later in June, the NHL confirmed that it would not cooperate with the CHA or WCHL, and Pollock stated that he was aware of the Niagara Falls Flyers being sympathetic to the CHA, and that Butlin was canvassing for more support in British Columbia and Northern Ontario. In July 1968, Pollock helped to set up meetings across Western Canada to outline the CAHA's development plan for teams which had remained within the CAHA. Later that month, he approved a series of exhibition games for teams in the OHA to play the Regina Pats and Weyburn Red Wings, after Regina and Weyburn had asked for assistance in forming the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. Pollock also laid out plans to make player transfers easier between provinces to support the Saskatchewan teams. The CAHA also agreed to help cover the OHA's costs to go west, and also play the Canada men's national ice hockey team in Winnipeg. In September 1968, the Western Ontario Junior A Hockey League (WOJHL) left the OHA and joined the rival CHA. Pollock stated that players leaving for the WOJHL would face difficulty in being reinstated with the OHA, but no suspensions were issued. He also felt that Butlin was making a smokescreen for the failing CHA, when claims were made that NHL teams had contacted the CHA for placement of prospect players. In October 1968, Pollock was feeling overwhelmed by the expectations as the CAHA president. He announced his resignation after taking a week's vacation to contemplate his future. Fred Page announced that he had received the resignation of Pollock on October 22, 1968, and that no changes would be made to the CAHA committee until the semiannual meeting in January 1969. Page also said the association will \\"greatly miss the many years of hockey experience which Pollock brought to the CAHA as an officer\\". Pollock resigned for \\"business reasons\\" after his professional career shifted from Windsor to Chatham, Ontario. Journalist Reyn Davis of the Winnipeg Free Press reported that the resignation was not a surprise, and described Pollock as a silver-haired gentleman with a kind disposition, who had been run ragged by the time demands of being CAHA president. Pollock was transferred to Chatham in July 1968, commuted round- trip from Windsor each weekday, was frequently contacted at work for hockey matters, spent his evenings responding to CAHA business, and was away on weekends for hockey events. He considered selling his house, but chose to remain in Windsor since he was close to retiring and wanted to keep his wife happy. Another factor was the Government of Canada getting involved in ice hockey and amateur sport, which resulted in the proposal to start another governing body in Hockey Canada, in addition to the competing CAHA and CHA. Pollock regretted becoming CAHA president at a critical time in his life, which coincided with the division of ice hockey governing bodies in Canada. Later life and honours alt=Bronze grave marker for Pollock Pollock was succeeded as the CAHA president by Earl Dawson in January 1969, who had been acting as president since the resignation. Pollock was a recipient of the OHA Gold Stick award in 1970, in recognition of his career in ice hockey. He was inducted into the Windsor / Essex County Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, and was called \\"one of the greatest things that ever happened to Windsor athletics\\". Pollock died September 9, 1993, at the Windsor Western Hospital Centre. He was survived by wife Freda, a son and a daughter. He was interred at Victoria Memorial Gardens in Tecumseh, Ontario. Family Pollock's nephew Clarke Pollock was an on-ice official in the OHA for 20 seasons. Clarke's son Kevin Pollock won an OHA championship playing as a member of the Hanover Barons in 1991. Kevin also officiated in the OHA before becoming an NHL referee. Clarke and Kevin are the namesakes of the Pollock Division in the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

Coking coal is being mined for over a century in the Eastern Jharia Area with such mines as Bhowrah, Sudamdih and Patherdih. Geo-mining conditions in the underground mines vary from moderate to extreme. In some cases, it is so extreme that these are amongst the most difficult mines to work in the world. This has resulted in the deeper seams, with good quality prime coking coal, to remain untapped. Moreover, shallow deposits worked by primitive methods, in pre-nationalisation period, is leading to mining fire. Geography =Location= The Eastern Jharia Area office is located at .

It was established in 1910 and is part of the Randolph County School System. Parts of the school have burned down twice, once in 1910 and again in 1994. The school courted controversy when its principal banned interracial couples at its school dances.  History  = 1910: Opening = In 1907, the Alabama Legislature passed a law to place a high school in every county. Due to this law, Randolph County High School (then Wedowee Normal College) was opened September 6, 1910, with a total of 81 students. Moses R. Weston was the first principal, and Professor James A. Parrish was assistant principal. = 1910: Burning = Randolph County High School was destroyed by fire less than three months after opening. On November 30, 1910, L.J. Johnson, an African American teacher, discovered the fire. Shortly after the fire alarm was sounded, most of Wedowee's population was on the scene. Even so, the fire was already so large that no one believed it could be stopped. The courthouse in Wedowee was used to provide temporary classrooms. Judge A.J. Weathers donated five acres of land for the new school, and the Zobel brothers began building a two-story brick building on July 3, 1911. A completion date was set for November 1, 1911. On November 29, 1911, the new school opened with only four completed classrooms. Professor James A. Parrish was named the new principal, and the enrollment increased to 143 students in this new building. = 1938: Present location = On August 30, 1938, the Randolph County Board of Education purchased 12 acres of land for $1,000 from the estate of J.H. Pool. Newman Construction Company was awarded the contract for the new building in December 1938. = 1994: Racism involving principal = Hulond Humphries was principal of Randolph County High School from 1969 to 1994. On February 24, 1994, during an assembly addressing the prom, Humphries allegedly said that he would cancel the prom if students planned to take dates of a different race. ReVonda Bowen, a young lady of mixed race, asked who she should take to the prom. According to ReVonda and other classmates at the assembly, Humphries replied: \\"That's a problem, ReVonda. Your mom and daddy made a mistake, having a mixed-race child.\\" After his remarks created a furor, he said he would not cancel the prom. As a result, Humphries was placed on paid leave (pending an investigation) by the school board. Ms. Bowen filed a lawsuit against Humphries with the Southern Poverty Law Center. Bowen reached a settlement with the school district to end the lawsuit. The amount of money was not disclosed. Neither Humphries nor the school board admitted wrongdoing. After two weeks, Humphries was reinstated as principal. The prom took place on April 23, 1994, but some students attended an alternative dance arranged by civil rights leaders. = 1994: Burning = On August 6, 1994, a suspicious fire burned down the main building of the 56-year-old high school. Volunteer firemen said they responded to the fire at 1 a.m. EDT, and the rubble was still smoldering that afternoon. Officials said that they were almost positive it was arson. Alabama Governor Jim Folsom offered $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those who set the fire. Officials of the Alabama State Fire Marshal's office and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms studied the rubble for three days. State Fire Marshal John Robison said, \\"This was an incendiary fire, an intentionally set fire. Whether they knew what they were doing or not, they were pretty successful.\\" Media outlets such as Jet magazine referenced the racial dispute from earlier in the year; however, authorities would not say if the fire was linked. Humphries broke his long silence about the dispute when he said, \\"I have resigned myself to the view that it is for the best.\\" A Federal Judge in Montgomery canceled the hearing scheduled to have Humphries removed. The head of the Justice Department's civil rights division said the school board's decision to reassign Humphries to an administrative job, coordinating the rebuilding of the high school, satisfied the Federal agency's goal of relieving racial hostility. They named a white man as the new principal and a black woman as assistant principal. Humphries later ran for superintendent of schools and was elected. The Randolph High School football stadium is named after him. June 1, 1995, the FBI arrested Christopher Lynn Johnson, son of a black protest leader, in connection with the burning. On October 21, 1995, his trial was held. Johnson's lawyer said that the real culprit was Humphries. In interviews, Humphries admitted to removing personal and school items from his office and purchasing gasoline. In the transcripts, Humphries seemed to implicate himself twice with what prosecutors insisted were \\"slips of the tongue.\\" Prosecutors presented no physical evidence linking Johnson to the fire, so he was acquitted in the Federal court. The present building cost around $4 million to build. The doors were opened to the students in March 1997.

It first appeared in the video game Resident Evil 2. It has appeared outside video games, including in film. It is one of the most iconic creatures in the game series, as result of a further mutation in zombies infected with certain strains of T-Virus. This process is known as V-ACT. The Licker is noted for its large, exposed brains; lack of skin; sensitivity to sound and their eponymous tongues. The Licker has lost the use of its eyes and cannot track prey by sight. Their super-developed hearing, however, more compensates for the loss. Upon detecting potential prey it will attack full force with teeth, tongue and claws, often alerting others of its kind in the vicinity as well. Weapons that emit very little sound, such as the bowgun, are especially useful.  Development  The Licker came into existence at some point after the Crimson Head Prototype 1's creation, when the V-ACT process was underground research. By 1998, they were undergoing research at the Raccoon City Underground Laboratory as potential bio-weapons. During the Raccoon City Destruction Incident, the creatures made their way to the Raccoon Police Station, which the Raccoon Police Department (RPD) officers encountered throughout the building. It was there that the name \\"Licker\\" was given by the officers, due to its incredibly long tongue which can kill or injure people at a distance especially when climbing through walls or ceilings. Also during the same outbreak, a potent variant of the T-Virus infected the water supply at the Apple Inn hotel, creating a large number of the creatures. According to producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, on Creatures from Resident Evil 2 returning to the 2019 remake said that \\"The alligator boss, the licker's first appearance... those are all in there\\" and stating that \\"The licker for example. In the E3 build, you reach the corridor where you expect the licker to appear. There's evidence it's been there: a body hanging from the ceiling, claw marks on the wall, another body torn apart by claws. But he's not actually there\\". It was also created to be the most iconic moments in the series.  Appearances  The Licker appears several Resident Evil video games. Its first appearance was in Resident Evil 2, in Resident Evil 5, another type of mutated licker \\"type b\\" which has more abilities of hearing, and Resident Evil 7 as Black Licker. The Licker returned in the 2019 remake and 2020 remake as a remaster of the game to prove and make the graphics look more modern, including the creature.https://www.vg247.com/2020/04/03/resident- evil-3-remake-walkthrough-carlos-return-rcpd/ The Licker also appeared in the Resident Evil films, Resident Evil Project Resistance,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-12-project-resistance- is-an-asymmetric-resident-evil-spin-off-in-which-you-can-play-as-mr-x and Resident Evil 2 Remake VR Project, where fans made the game where the players can pet Licker.  Reception  According to Metro, the Licker looks like an Alien from the Metroid series, and reminded them of the Xenomorph from Alien: Isolation, and also praised the creature especially in the Resident Evil 2 remake. According to GameSpot, Akuma from Street Fighter should be placed in Resident Evil 2 to deal with the Licker, also stating that \\"addition could prove a humorous and unexpected way to experience the horrors of Raccoon City\\". Destructoid said that the Licker was Resident Evil 2s most fearsome monstrosity. GameRant also praises the jumpscare that the Licker made in the Resident Evil 2 remake and the Licker's introduction was the scariest moment and stating that \\"The Licker‚Äôs appearance is foreshadowed by thick globs of drool dripping from the ceiling, which leads up to an intense showdown inside the halls of the Raccoon City Police Station.\\",https://gamerant.com/resident- evil-scariest-moments/ and also said that \\"Those distant memories of the introduction of the Licker and the bishop plug (a personal favorite) are about to become someone's new, happy horror moment\\". Licker was also remade by fans to be pet on the fan-made game as VR.

Biography Son of Domenico Maria and Anna Maria Cestari, he was the descendant of the Gagliardis dalla Volta counts palatine. Toderini studied philosophy and archaeology, but tended toward contemplative and religious life since his youth and joined the Society of Jesus. He was employed in teaching, dedicating himself to philosophy in Verona and Forli. After the suppression of the Jesuits, Toderini lost his position, and in October 1781 he joined the entourage of the Venetian ambassador to Constantinople, Agostino Garzoni. Toderini remained there, living in the ambassador's house, until May 1786, studying Ottoman Turkish literature and collecting books and manuscripts in Arabic and other languages. There, he wrote his three volume Letteratura Turchesa (\\"Turkish Literature\\"), the first European survey of Turkish literature, published in Venice the year after his return by Giacomo Storti. This work was soon translated into French and German. Toderini criticized slavery and colonialism, writing \\"You should ask the Negroes, bought like pitiful cattle to the dishonour of humanity, labouring at the caves of the [silver mines of] Potosi, and in Peru, losing their strength and life, what advantage they drew from the luxuries of Europe.\\" His work sought to impress upon Europeans the degree to which Muslims had pursued science and knowledge, contrary to European perceptions at the time. Beyond his pioneering work on Turkish literature, Toderini's other works included religious tracts, a dissertation on marine lightning conductors, and other topics.

Conventionally, the revival lasted from 1055 until 1258. Richard Bulliet has proposed that the term \\"recentering\\" better describes the period than \\"revival\\" or \\"renaissance\\". The period is characterized as much by developments within Sunnism as by Sunni relations with Shia Islam. In particular, it was a period homogenization of Sunnism as scholars and leaders strove for ijmƒÅ ø (consensus). Some scholars have argued that the Sunni Revival led to the decline of scientific output in the Islamic world. Timing The Sunni Revival followed a period of Shia ascendancy, sometimes called the \\"Shia Century\\", under the Fatimid dynasty in Africa, Palestine and parts of Arabia; the Hamdanid dynasty in Syria; and the Buyid dynasty in Iraq and Iran. During this period, Shia polities controlled most of the Islamic world, including its core areas. The Abbasid Caliph, the supreme Sunni leader, was under the control of the Buyids, who governed Baghdad, while the Sharif of Mecca was under the authority of the Fatimids. The revival began when the Sunni Seljuk Turks conquered Baghdad from the Buyids in 1055. The period of Seljuk domination lasted roughly a century, until about 1150. They were definitively ousted from Baghdad in 1157. Thereafter a period of Abbasid resurgence and ecumenism followed until the Mongols sacked Baghdad in 1258. Spread The chief architect of the political and legal Sunni revival was Nizam al-Mulk (d. 1092), grand vizier of the Seljuk Empire. He founded the school which took his name, the Nizamiyya of Baghdad. The chief architect of the theological revival, al-Ghazali (d. 1111), taught at Nizam's school in Baghdad. This was not the first madrasa, but it was by far the most influential and nizamiyya fashioned after that in Baghdad were founded wherever the Sunni revival spread. They were a major factor in the homogenization of Sunnism during the revival. The figure most associated with the Sunni Revival in Syria is Nur ad- Din (d. 1174), who built twenty madrasas in Damascus. In 1171, Saladin crushed the Fatimid Caliphate and brought Egypt into the Sunni fold. His Ayyubid dynasty vigorously strengthened Sunnism in Syria, Palestine and Egypt.

According to legend, from the 6th to 7th centuries CE, H≈çd≈ç traveled from India through China and the Korean kingdom of Baekje and eventually arrived in Japan. He is recognized as the founder of temples in the mountains of Harima Province and is associated with several chokugan-ji (ÂãÖÈ°òÂØ∫), Buddhist temples built at the request of the reigning emperor. Tradition holds that when H≈çd≈ç came to Japan, he was accompanied by the deity Gozu Tenn≈ç (ÁâõÈ†≠Â§©Áéã; Sanskrit: Go≈õƒ´r·π£a devarƒÅja), who was later enshrined at Hiromine Shrine and Yasaka Shrine. While engaged in ascetic practice on Mount Rokk≈ç at the Kumoga Iwa Rock (Èõ≤„É∂Â≤©), H≈çd≈ç is said to have been approached by the deity Vai≈õrava·πáa riding on purple clouds. It was after this encounter that H≈çd≈ç built Tamon-ji in Hy≈çgo Prefecture to enshrine the Kumoga Iwa Rock, Rokk≈ç-Hime-Daizen-no-Kami (ÂÖ≠Áî≤ÊØîÂëΩÂ§ßÂñÑÁ•û), and the Shinky≈ç Iwa Rock. Other names Legend says that H≈çd≈ç would fly through the air with food and money in an iron bowl to offer to those in need, which gained him the nickname Hihatsu no H≈çd≈ç (È£õÈâ¢„ÅÆÊ≥ïÈÅì lit. \\"Flying Bowl H≈çd≈ç\\"). It is also said that on one occasion, he happened upon a ship carrying rice that had been paid as land tax. H≈çd≈ç asked for one bowl of rice, to which the tax man refused. As a result, when H≈çd≈ç flew away, the bags of rice rose into the air and followed him. The tax man pursued the ascetic into the mountains and apologized for his miserliness. He promised to provide H≈çd≈ç with one bowl of rice for the return of his rice bags.

This is the oldest golf course still active on Nantucket and one of the oldest golf courses in America. It once was considered the oldest privately owned golf course in the country still open to the public but, as of May 1, 2012, it is no longer privately owned. It is still known by island locals as \\"Skinner's Golf Club\\", or \\"Skinner's\\", because Robert \\"Skinner\\" Coffin was a co-owner and the superintendent of the course for many years and use to host a recreational golf tournament, known as \\"The Skinner Open\\", which was held during the years 1977 to 2011. It is currently operating as a public 9-hole course. This course was also listed in Links Magazines article titled \\"The Top 10 Old Courses You Can Play\\". On October 24, 2019, this course was named the New England Golf Course Owners Association's \\"Golf Course of New England\\" for 2020.  History  Tourism was responsible for the creation of the island's golf courses as Nantucket catered more to this industry at the end of the 19th century. In 1894, John Grout leased property near Siasconset from owner Levi Starbuck Coffin to develop this course on the land which was the old Bloomingdale Farm. The current course's clubhouse is the old farmhouse. This course was designed by John Grout and Alex Findlay. In 1917, Mike Brady set the United States record for scoring two holes in one in an 18-hole match which was a record held until 1949. This course thrived until 1922 which was when the Sankaty Head Golf Club was established and became their competition. After this many golfers started playing at Sankaty Head Golf Club instead. Due to this competition, this course was abandoned by the Coffin family for many years until. In 1930, Henry Coffin Jr., at age 16, took over running it. The course had numerous changes over its history. The original square greens were changed to the well-known round greens. Even the amount of holes changed from 9-holes to 18-holes and then back to 9-holes before World War II. Henry Coffin Jr. was the golf superintendent of this course until he died in June 1994. In 1994, after Henry Coffin Jr.'s death, Robert Coffin became the course's new superintendent. Robert Coffin was already working with his father on the course before his death. The then Coffin estate, comprising 460 acres, was passed down to his four children: Robert (\\"Skinner\\"), Henry (\\"Hank\\") III, Stephanie, and Mitchell Coffin. In 1995, the four children were forced to sell off 250 acres to pay inheritance taxes to keep the golf course property. The Nantucket Golf Club, Inc. purchased the 250 acres for $8.25 million and, in 1998, their new 18-hole private course opened. The land they purchased included the second and third holes of the original Siaconset Golf Course, so these holes needed to be redesigned. Now the second hole is a 480-yard stretch with a dog-leg right hook and the third hole is a par 3 tight 217 yard stretch with a sloping fairway. Also in 1995, the Nantucket Golf Club, Inc. leased the Siasconset Golf Course from the Coffin family for a 10-year period. Robert Coffin was the superintendent of the course over the duration of the lease and maintained the course independently. The Coffin family chose not to renew the lease when the course fell into disrepair toward the end of the lease period. In 2005, Robert Coffin retired as the course's superintendent and was succeeded by his brother and fellow co-owner Henry Coffin III who came out of retirement to be the course's next superintendent. Henry Coffin III previously had worked at Sankaty Head Golf Club as their course superintendent for 22 years. Robert Coffin still remained the bookkeeper of the club. In 2012, Henry Coffin III retired as the course's superintendent as it was then acquired on May 1, 2012 by a joint effort of The Nantucket Island Land Bank and The 'Sconset Trust. This was when this course ceased to be privately owned. Shortly thereafter, on July 19, 2012, 118 years after the course's creation, the course had its first website of www.siasconsetgolf.com, which last existed on November 10, 2015. Currently this course is managed by NGM Inc, which is the same management team running the Miacomet Golf Course; one of the other golf courses on Nantucket. The current general manager is Alan Costa. The current superintendent is Sean Oberly. On October 24, 2019, the Siasconset Golf Course was named the New England Golf Course Owners Association's \\"Golf Course of New England\\" for 2020.

Working for WLS-TV and WMAQ-TV, he established a reputation as an investigative journalist, and became known as a go-between who negotiated more than 115 surrenders to police of wanted felons, often wanted for murder. Early life Russ Ewing was born in Chicago. At the age of seven he was orphaned, first taken in by an aunt, and later adopted by a neighboring family. Following attendance at Englewood High School, he became a firefighter in Chicago. In the 1960s he began work as a film courier for WMAQ, and first appeared on-camera in 1967. Career In the 1970s Ewing won awards for investigative reporting on abuses at Chicago's animal shelter and on discriminatory lending practices by Chicago-area banks. In 1974 he won an Emmy Award for his reports on conditions at the Cook County Jail, where he had posed as an inmate for two days. Ewing won eight more Emmys in his career. In 1975 Ewing convinced a murder suspect to surrender to police, and the following year Ewing and publisher Gus Savage negotiated the surrender of two robbers who had taken hostages. Following his move to WLS, he continued to arrange for surrenders, eventually reaching as many as 115 surrenders. Ewing aired the first interview with serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 following Gacy's conviction, and in 1986 established the identity of a previously unidentified victim of Gacy's. Working with dental records, Ewing identified victim Timothy McCoy. Ewing retired from WLS in 1995, briefly returning in 1998 to WMAQ as a special correspondent. An accomplished pianist, he formed the Russ Ewing Trio in 1981. Following a childhood interest in aviation, he obtained a private pilot's license and occasionally used his personal airplane in surrenders.

The Johnson family and company commissioned many Wright buildings, such as their corporate headquarters Johnson Wax Headquarters, the Wingspread conference center very near the school, and others. The first building became the Middle School, and is a complete circle surrounding a small courtyard. The Lower and Upper School buildings were soon added, which are curved arcs attached to the Middle School by hallways. Other early additions included a small gymnasium, a circular cafeteria, and a teardrop-shaped art department with a second story for offices and small student workspaces with excellent lighting. Most Prairie School buildings are single story, made of brick, and colored red, and emphasize circles. With the exception of the field house, there are hallways connecting them. In 1969 the H.F. Johnson Fieldhouse opened. There was a $14 million planned addition, built circa 2004, added to the fieldhouse's north, with engineering done by Zimmerman Design Group and general contracting being done by Bukacek Construction. The addition includes a two-story atrium connecting it with the original building as well as basketball courts, a multipurpose room used for dance classes, a running track inside the building, and a weight room.  Athletics  The following sports are offered in the Upper School: Fall: *Cross Country (Coed Varsity) *Golf (Golf ‚Äì Girls Varsity) *Golf (Golf ‚Äì Girls JV) *Soccer (Boys Varsity) *Soccer (Boys JV) *Tennis (Girls Varsity) *Tennis (Girls JV) *Volleyball (Girls Varsity) *Volleyball (Girls JV) *Volleyball (Girls JV2) *Swimming & Diving (Girls‚Äô Varsity) Winter: *Basketball (Boys Varsity) *Basketball (Boys JV 1) *Basketball (Boys JV 2) *Basketball (Girls Varsity) *Basketball (Girls JV) *Swimming & Diving (Boys Varsity) *Wrestling (Varsity) Spring: *Baseball (Varsity) *Baseball (JV) *Golf (Golf ‚Äì Boys Varsity) *Golf (Golf ‚Äì Boys JV) *Soccer (Girls Varsity) *Soccer (Girls JV) *Tennis (Boys Varsity) *Tennis (Boys JV) *Track (Boys) *Track (Girls) Further reading * References External links * The Prairie School Category:Schools in Racine County, Wisconsin Category:Private K-12 schools in the United States Category:Private high schools in Wisconsin Category:Private middle schools in Wisconsin Category:Private elementary schools in Wisconsin Category:1965 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Educational institutions established in 1965 ","title":"The Prairie School"},{"id":"61193237","text":"Pushkino () is a rural locality (a village) in Bedeyevo-Polyansky Selsoviet, Blagoveshchensky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

He is known for improvising electronic songs that feature comical lyrics. Rebillet primarily distributes his work through YouTube videos and Twitch live streams in which he uses a loop station, keyboard, vocals, and percussion instruments to produce his songs in his apartment. He also has released two studio albums: Marc Rebillet and Europe, and three extended play records, Loop Daddy, Loop Daddy II, and Loop Daddy III.  Early life  Rebillet started playing piano at age four, and studied classical music until age 15 while attending Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. He dropped out of Southern Methodist University after one year of studying acting. Rebillet then worked in other sectors for ten years, including in a corporate call center, while producing music unsuccessfully under the name \\"Leae\\". In 2007, Rebillet was profiled on Fox 4 in Dallas after lining up to be first to buy an iPhone during its initial release. A woman paid Rebillet $800 for his spot in the front of the line, attempting to buy many phones to resell. The plan backfired because of the store's policy that only allowed one iPhone per customer. In 2016, Rebillet claimed on Reddit to have discovered an alleged unreleased 1998 Sufjan Stevens album in a dumpster outside record label Asthmatic Kitty's studios in Dumbo, Brooklyn in 2014. A representative from the label who responded to the post was unable to confirm the album's authenticity, but requested that Rebillet not share it. A few hours later, Rebillet proceeded to upload the album and share it on 4chan. In an interview with Stereogum the next day, he expressed regret for disrespecting the label's wishes, but stated he wanted to let the album be preserved online. When asked if the album was possibly a hoax, Rebillet responded, \\"I have neither the time nor the desire to prove its authenticity.\\"  Career  alt= = Online streaming = Rebillet's professional music career began in 2016, when he began publishing YouTube videos and live streams of himself improvising songs in his bedroom, apartment, and hotel rooms, often while dancing in his boxer briefs. These videos began to go viral through Reddit and Facebook, generating a fan base. Many of Rebillet's songs are inspired by live requests from his fans, who call him from a phone number that he posts on social media, or comment during the live stream. Rebillet's sessions can last from one to five hours. The content of the streams vary widely, from romance and sex to more frivolous topics, such as snacking. As of July 2020, Rebillet has 11.8 million online streams of his music, has 753,000 YouTube subscribers, and 50 million YouTube views. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Rebillet's tour of Australia and New Zealand was cancelled and subsequently rescheduled for early 2021. In place of the cancelled shows, he scheduled four free live stream shows on Twitch named for four cities on the cancelled tour. He called this collection of shows the \\"Quarantine Livestream Tour\\", with the first show attracting over 1.57 million viewers and raising over $34,000 for coronavirus-related charity. Explaining why he chose to begin streaming on Twitch, Rebillet told The Verge, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to survive, and Twitch has the highest earning potential for livestreams.‚Äù Also related to the pandemic, Rebillet recorded a song, called \\"Essential Workers Anthem\\", dedicated to essential workers, to thank them for their work. Discussing the song for the Boston Herald, Jed Gottlieb wrote that \\"the tune he built in a minute had more moxie and magic than anything on the recent lo-fi network TV concerts\\". = Live performances = Rebillet performing in Dublin in 2019 His first live shows took place in 2017 in bars in his native Dallas, Texas. He subsequently moved to New York to further develop his music career. Describing how his online presence quickly increased his fanbase, Rebillet told an interviewer: > It happened very, very quickly...the whole online thing just took off in > this very aggressive way. Like, people around the world just started sharing > my stuff on Facebook primarily, and my audience on Facebook went from 7,000 > or 10,000 followers to, within a week or two, 50,000. Then it was 100,000. > And it just kept climbing! And with that spike came all of these booking > requests from all over the world that I really had no clue how to deal with > or what to do with. Starting in 2019, Rebillet has performed on tours in the United States and Europe, and ticket sales has become his primary source of revenue. Rebillet's live shows are energetic, interactive, and almost entirely improvised, with very little material being repeated from show to show. Explaining his approach to performance, Rebillet said, \\"I think up a couple of ideas, make some observations through the day, think of something that‚Äôs germane to the crowd I‚Äôm playing to, I use those things as seedlings for song ideas.\\" The Dublin Gazette called Rebillet \\"a man who‚Äôs thoughtful far beyond his output. A considered artist, having fun.\\" The Irish Examiner called Rebillet a \\"DJ/comedian/one-person emotional meltdown\\" and called his live performance \\"unnerving and very engaging\\". Tyler Hicks of the Dallas Observer said that \\"few performers can match the zealous intensity\\". = Drive-In Concert Tour = In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, in which all concerts were cancelled, Rebillet scheduled a \\"drive-in concert tour\\" in June 2020, in which he performed at twelve shows at eight drive-in theaters in the United States while attendees watch from their cars and listen over a local radio frequency. The objective of these performances was to remain in compliance with social distancing regulations. In place of opening acts, short films were shown. Explaining how he planned to perform, Rebillet told CNN, \\"Since everyone is going to be forced to be in their cars, I'll be able to do a lot of running around, 'interacting' with the audience, just by doing my thing.\\" The tour was called the first of its kind in the United States, and grossed $523,000 with 12,132 attendees. Rebillet reached more fans on the drive-in tour than he would have on a comparable tour of indoor venues.  Awards and recognition  In August 2019, Billboard named Rebillet as a \\"Billboard Dance Emerging Artist\\", writing that Rebillet creates \\"sexy hooks\\", \\"sensual R&B; burners\\", and \\"hip-hop-tinged funk creations\\". In December 2019, Shacknews awarded Rebillet the \\"Do it for Shacknews Award 2019\\", saying that he rose to a \\"surprising level of Internet notoriety\\" in 2019. Shacknews CEO Asif Khan wrote: \\"The popularity of his very experimental style to creating music is inspiring to the countless part-time studio musicians who are out there on the Internet. Marc's ability to build a community has lead to [sic] pockets of cheerleaders appearing all over the place these days.\\" In 2020, Clubbing TV named Rebillet #2 on its list of the top 40 live streaming DJs, saying, \\"No one can make you laugh and dance like Marc Rebillet.\\"  Music  Rebillet's music is defined by his use of a Boss RC-505 loop station, which allows him to layer his voice with keyboards, tambourines, and other hand percussion instruments. Most of his songs are improvised, and include elements of funk, soul, hip hop, and house music, as well as comedy skits. Nick Pagano described Rebillet's music as ranging \\"from soulful serenading piano ballads to funky bass licks to downright club bangers, and is always accompanied by his unique sense of humor\\". His lyrics tend to be comical, silly, or vulgar, enough so that he has been referred to as a comedian. Rebillet's \\"goofy\\", \\"nerdy\\", and \\"earnest\\" personality plays a role in his popularity. Speaking about the lyrical content of Rebillet's songs, WBUR's Tonya Mosley said, \\"they‚Äôre actually really insightful. It‚Äôs sort of like social commentary.\\" Rebillet has mentioned Reggie Watts, Nina Simone, Madlib, and James Blake as sources of inspiration. Speaking about Reggie Watts, Rebillet has said, \\"I would not be doing this if he didn‚Äôt exist.\\" Discography =Solo albums= * Marc Rebillet (2018) * Europe (2019) =Extended plays= * Loop Daddy (2018) * Loop Daddy II (2019) * Loop Daddy III (2020) =Singles= * Funk Emergency (2019) * One More Time (2019) * You Were There (2019) * Work That Ass For Daddy (2019) =As Leae= * Pod 314 (with USooME) (2012) * Rattlebrain EP (2013) * week  ep (2013) References  External links   Interview of Marc Rebillet with WBUR * Interview of Marc Rebillet on NPR, on the topic of his drive-in concert tour * Interview of Marc Rebillet with Yahoo!

In addition, it orders that all medical treatments for transitioning be included in the Compulsory Medical Program, which guarantees coverage by practices throughout the health system, both public and private. Approved by the Senate on 9 May 2012 and promulgated on 24 May, it has been lauded by the United Nations as a pioneering step for transgender rights in the region. History =Background= The most remote antecedent regarding the question of gender identity in Argentina dates back to 1966, in which a doctor performed a sex reassignment operation on a trans woman patient. He received a suspended sentence of three years for the crime of very serious injuries under Article 91 of the country's Penal Code. In 1989, Judge Mario Calatayud of Room F of the National Chamber of Civil Appeals of Buenos Aires, in dissent with the presiding majority, granted the first recognition of the gender identity of a trans woman who had requested a change to her registered name and sex. In 1997, a case emerged that captivated the mass media. It was that of a trans woman, , who had raised a large number of children as her own, and had been denounced by one of the mothers for the appropriation of her minor children. Beginning in 2007, a number of legislative proposals were promoted to guarantee travestis, transsexual, and transgender people rights to identity and comprehensive health care. Using a strategy almost identical to that with which approval of the same-sex marriage law was achieved, several amparo cases were brought before the Tribunals in Contentious Administrative and Tax Matters of the City of Buenos Aires with the purpose of ordering modifications to the registered name and sex of trans individuals. The first of these rulings pertained to the trans actress and vedette Florencia De La V, who received her reissued National Identity Document (DNI) from the hands of the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers An√≠bal Fern√°ndez and Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo in the House of Government. =Processing of the law= On 8 November 2011, the author and the General Legislation and Justice Commissions of the National Congress discussed the bill presented by deputies Diana Conti, , and , and approved its dispatch for further processing. On 1 December 2011 the Chamber of Deputies approved the draft law by 167 votes in favor, 17 against, and 7 abstentions. The Gender Identity Law was approved by the Senate on 9 May 2012, by 55 votes in favor and one abstention. It was promulgated by Decree No. 773/2012 of the National Executive Power on 24 May 2012 and carries number 26.743. The law was regulated by Decree 1007/2012. The became the specialized unit for advice and assistance on matters within the scope of the law. On 26 May, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement of congratulation for the law, saying \\"Argentina has taken an important step to guarantee equality, respect, and dignity for trans people.\\" Rights recognized The Gender Identity Law allows a person to modify their personal data in the National Registry and to change their registered name, image, and sex by submitting a letter. The DNI number is not modified. This process is free and does not require a lawyer. The law also grants access to hormonal treatments and total or partial surgical interventions for the purpose of transitioning. Hospitals must cover these as part of the Compulsory Medical Plan.
