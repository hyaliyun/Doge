He served as the deputy-chief of staff of the army and was one of the most powerful figures in the army and in national politics until his assassination, blamed on a SSNP militant in 1955.Assad laments losing his father's grand visionThe National Malki's assassination led to a crackdown on the SSNP in Syria.  Family History and Childhood  Adnan al-Malki was born in 1918 to a wealthy and prestigious Damascene family. Malki's family originally were North African Ulama trained in the Maliki school of jurisprudence.  Military career  Adnan al-Malki graduated from Homs Military Academy in 1935. In 1951 President Adib al- Shishakli outlawed most political parties in Syria. Malki concerned with Presidents actions urged that the Ba'ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party Become one. This merger became known as Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party in late 1952. In 1953 Malki submitted a memorandum that Colonel Shishakli at the Damascus airport upon his return from Cairo to release all political prisoners and end the one party rule. This leads to his imprisonment in 1954. After military rule ended Malki was reinstated in the army and promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff.  Views and Baath Party Affiliation  Malki never became a member of the Baath party. He was close to the military leadership of the Baath and his brother Riyad was a long time Baathist. Malki was a Nasserist as well as an Arab nationalist. This collided in particular with the views of the Syrian nationalist SSNP who sought unity with Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Palestine instead of Egypt.  Assassination  On Friday April 22, 1955 Senior officers including Adnan al-Malki went to the Damascus Municipal Stadium to cheer on the army's football team against a visiting Egyptian team. Malki was seated in the VIP box along with General Shuqayr and the Egyptian ambassador. Halfway through the game military police sergeant Yunis Abdul Rahim fired two shots into Malki with his revolver killing him. Abdul Rahim appeared to have personal motivation in the assassination as Malki a few months prior had denied him entry for sectarian reasons into the Homs Military Academy. Abdul Rahim attempted to commit suicide shortly after, however, the gun jammed and he committed suicide with a back-up gun. According to other sources, Abdul Rahim did not act for his own account but killed Malki at the personal order of the SSNP's then party leader George Abd al-Massih.  Legacy  The SSNP was outlawed in Syria. The leadership of the party was arrested or exiled. The aftermath of the assassination also entailed a split within the party. A large statue of Adnan al-Malki was placed in central Damascus and a luxurious neighborhood was name after him by the Ba'ath party that came to power in 1963.

It is situated on a wetland and is adjacent to the suburbs of Linksfield and Orange Grove. It comprises approx. 200 hectares of grassland and woodland, with three tree- lined dams providing fishing and bird-watching opportunities. Three golf courses take up most of the space on the park, and, although the blue course is a former SA open course and is still playable, the white and the yellow courses has been left untended for years and have gone to seed. It is one of Johannesburg¬¥s most underutilised and underdeveloped parks, with a property tussle underway for over ten years, with developers wanting to turn the park into anything from casinos to golf estates, and residents beating it back every time. This parks decline is a classic story of new South African mismanagement and corruption with the Johannesburg city council champing at the bit to sell the park for a quick buck. Their granting of leases with very onerous terms (such as a 6-month notice period on 20-year leases) means no-one would invest in the park resulting in its decline and likely sale for property development purposes. The bulk of the legal defense of the park has been done by the Huddle and Environs Anti Degradation (HEAD) league. Unfortunately they have no web presence. The park has been defended by various other groups of residents, including the Friends of Huddle Park and the Huddle Huggers, who have also created the Facebook group Save Huddle Park. Residents groups insist that more is done with the park as golfers already have much choice in the area. Ideas they have put forward and would like to see are cycle and mountain bike tracks and trails, running and walking tracks and trails. Securing a section of the park specifically as an eco-park for the education of the public about wetlands and bird life is also a popular idea and was agreed in principle with the current manager. All of these services have not been acted upon and the future of the park remains hanging in balance unless the park can become more of a public service and less of an eyesore.

It is an odorless neonicotinoid insecticide produced under the trade names Assail, and Chipco by Aventis CropSciences. It is systemic and intended to control sucking insects (Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, mainly aphids) on crops such as leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, pome fruits, grapes, cotton, cole crops, and ornamental plants. It is also a key pesticide in commercial cherry farming due to its effectiveness against the larvae of the cherry fruit fly. Acetamiprid is an insecticide belonging to the chloropyridinyl neonicotinoids, this family of insecticides was introduced in the early 1990s. This compound is an insecticide that is introduced for controlling pests, but also for domestic use to control fleas on cats and dogs.  Structure and reactivity  Acetamiprid is an alpha-Chloro-N-heteroaromatic compound. It is a neonicotinoid with a chloropyridinyl group and it is comparable to other neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid, nitenpyram and thiacloprid. These substances all have a 6-chloro-3-pyridine methyl group but differ in the nitroguanidine, nitromethylene, or cyanoamidine substituent on an acyclic or cyclic moiety. There are two isomeric forms in acetamiprid with E and Z-configurations of the cyanoimino group. There are also a variety of stable conformers due to the rotation of single bonds in the N-pyridylmethylamino group. The E-conformer is more stable than the Z-conformer and assumed to be the active form. In solution, two different E-conformers exist which slowly change into each other.  Mechanism of action  Acetamiprid is a nicotine- like substance and reacts to the body in a similar way as nicotine. Nicotine is a natural insecticide of which many man-made insecticides are derivatives. Acetamiprid is a nicotinic agonist that reacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh-R). These receptors are located in the post-synaptic dendrites of all neurons in the brain, spinal cord, ganglia and muscular junctions. The activation of the nACh-R receptors causes hyperactivity and muscle spasms, and eventually death. Acetamiprid is highly toxic to insects, but less to mammals.  Metabolism  The metabolism of acetamiprid has been primarily studied in plants and soil. However, a recent study (2005) focussed on the metabolism of acetamiprid in honey bees. The honey bees in this study were fed a sucrose solution that contained acetamiprid. Seven different metabolites were discovered, of which two could not be identified. The five most abundant of these metabolites were found in the abdomen of the bee. Within the first hour of ingestion, acetamiprid concentrations were highest in tissues with a high nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density such as the abdomen, thorax and head. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed throughout the bee‚Äôs body, but also rapidly metabolised into the seven compounds. The substance is not just broken down in the gut, but in the entire body of the bee. This is mainly done by Type I enzymes such as mixed function oxidases. These enzymes use O2 to catalyze a reaction and convert acetamiprid into more polar metabolites. This makes it easier to excrete the compounds because the compounds become more hydrophilic. Phase I enzymes form the first step in metabolizing the compound. Phase I metabolites can be bioactive. Three metabolic pathways exist, based on the kinetics of the metabolites that were found. The first pathway starts with the oxidative cleavage of the nitromethylene bond of acetamiprid. This is followed by another oxidation that forms 6-chloronicotinic acid. 6-Chloronicotinic acid is then transformed in one of the unidentified compounds, with an increased polarity. The second possible pathway is based on N-demethylation reactions, followed by oxidation of the nitromethylene bond of the intermediates. This will also result in 6-chloronicotinic acid. The last pathway consists of the oxidative cleavage of the cyanamine group. In this reaction a 1-3 ketone derivative is formed. This compound will undergo N-deacetylation which forms a 1-4 ketone derivative. This compound is transformed by oxidative cleavage into 6-chloropicolyl alcohol. From here, the compound can be metabolized in two different ways: either it is oxidized into 6-chloronicotinic acid or it is converted into a glycoconjugate derivative. The latter is probably in favour of the oxidization.  Efficacy and side effects  = Efficacy = Acetamiprid is used to produce a variety of crops, plants and flowers. It can be used combined with another pesticide with a different mode of action. This way the developing of resistance by pest species can be prevented. According to the US EPA acetamiprid could play a role in battling resistance in the species: Bemisia, greenhouse whiteflies and western flower thrips.US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs. (2010). Response Letter for Extension of the Exclusive Use Data Protection Period for Acetamiprid and Acetamiprid Technical. Neonicotinoids act as agonists for nAChR and are selectively toxic to insects versus mammals, because of a higher potency on insect than mammalian nAChRs. This increases their suitability as pesticides. = Adverse effects = Acetamiprid has a high potential for bioaccumulation and is highly toxic to birds and moderately toxic to aquatic organisms.University of Hertfordshire. (2018). Pesticide Properties DataBase. ‚Äúacetamiprid‚Äù. Retrieved from: https://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/ppdb/en/Reports/11.htm Excessive use of the pesticide could pose a threat to bird populations and other parts of the food chain. On the other hand, the metabolites that are produced after the absorption of acetamiprid in the honey bee are less toxic than those of other neonicotinoides. The half-life time of acetamiprid is also rather short, approximately 25‚Äì30 minutes, whereas other neonicotinoides can have a half- life of 4‚Äì5 hours. However, some metabolites are still present in the honey bee after 72 hours. This might be a toxicological risk for honey bees, as chronic exposure can increase the toxicity of certain compounds. The EPA considers it \\"only moderately toxic\\" to bees; however, some media sources and the recent documentary Vanishing of the Bees have blamed neonicotinoids like acetamiprid for colony collapse disorder. According to a report of the EPA from 2002, acetamiprid poses low risks to the environment compared to other insecticides. It degrades rapidly in soil and has therefore a low chance of leaching into groundwater. The degradation products will be able to reach the groundwater but are predicted to not be of toxicological significance.US Environmental Protection Agency. (2002). Pesticide Fact Sheet: Acetamiprid.  Toxicity  = Insect studies = Extensive studies in the honeybee showed that acetamiprid LD50 is 7.1 ¬µg with a 95% confidence interval of 4.57-11.2 ¬µg/bee. In comparison, the LD50 of imidacloprid is 17,9 ng per bee. The difference in these comparable substances may be explained by a slightly weaker affinity of acetamiprid for nAChr when compared with imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids with a nitroguanidine group, such as imidacloprid, are most toxic to honey bees. Acetamiprid has an acyclic group instead of a second heterocyclic ring and is therefore much less toxic to honey bees than nitro- substituted compounds. = Humans = As of now, two human case-studies have been described with acute poisoning by ingestion of an insecticide mixture containing acetamiprid whilst trying to commit suicide. Both patients were transported to an emergency room within two hours, and were instantly experiencing nausea, muscle weakness, convulsions and low body temperature (33.7 ¬∞C and 34.3 ¬∞C respectively). Symptoms such as muscle weakness seem to be similar to organophosphate insecticide exposure. Hypothermia and convulsions can be directly explained by the active acetamiprid compound which react with acetylcholine- and nicotinic receptors. Although mammalian toxicity is recorded as low, high doses of acetamiprid are recorded to be toxic to humans.Tomonori Imamura, Youichi Yanagawa, Kahoko Nishikawa, Naoto Matsumoto & Toshihisa Sakamoto (2010)Two cases of acute poisoning with acetamiprid in humans, Clinical Toxicology, 48:8, 851-853.  Safety indications  Acetamiprid is classified as unlikely to be a human carcinogen. Acetamiprid has a low acute and chronic toxicity in mammals with no evidence of carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity or mutagenicity. It is classified as toxicity category rating II in acute oral studies with rats, toxicity category III in acute dermal and inhalation studies with rats, and toxicity category IV in primary eye and skin irritation studies with rabbits. It is mobile in soil, but degrades rapidly via aerobic soil metabolism, with studies showing its half life between <1 and 8.2 days. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not consider it to be environmentally persistent. A recent study has implicated acetamiprid as a cause of erectile dysfunction in human males and may be implicated in the problem of declining human fertility, and called into question its safety, particularly where its use may be subject to abuse. To ensure that application rates do not exceed limits which may be toxic to non-target vertebrates, the US proposes a maximum application rate of 0.1 to 0.6 pounds of active ingredient per acre per season of agricultural land, differentiating between different crop types.US Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesticide Programs, Health Effects Division, Science Information Management Branch: \\"Chemicals Evaluated for Carcinogenic Potential\\" (2006) In China, the maximum dose is lower than in the US. The recommended dose that is used in agriculture ranges from 0.055 to 0.17 pounds of active ingredient per acre.

It is a 73 mm low pressure smoothbore semi-automatic gun with a wedge breech block. Development of the 2A28 Grom was directly linked to that of the SPG-9 recoilless gun; both fired projectiles similar to rocket- propelled grenades. Development History During the early 1960s, the Soviet Armed Forces issued a requirement for a new infantry transporter that was highly mobile, sufficiently armed to destroy comparable Western vehicles such as the M59 and the Sch√ºtzenpanzer Lang HS.30, and allowed embarked infantrymen to fight from within its crew compartment. This concept evolved into the BMP-1. The BMP was initially to be armed with a 23mm autocannon, a choice directly inspired by the success of the West German HS.30. However, the Soviet government had invested heavily in the development of anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) systems and discussion soon shifted to arming the BMP with missiles. This would allow it to defend itself against main battle tanks. The KB Priborostroyeniye design bureau in Tula soon proposed a specialized turret carrying both a low-velocity smoothbore gun and a mount for 9M14 Malyutka ATGMs. The purpose of the gun was to destroy tanks at closer ranges where the missiles were largely ineffective. Description The gun is relatively compact and weighs . In the BMP, the gun is brought to bear by an electric motor, with a manual mechanical backup. The maximum horizontal and vertical traverse speed with the electrical system is 20 ¬∞/s and 6 ¬∞/s respectively. Minimum horizontal and vertical direction rate is correspondingly 0.1 ¬∞/s and 0.07 ¬∞/s. The gun can be depressed and elevated between ‚àí4¬∞ and +33¬∞, with aimed fire possible up to an elevation of +15¬∞. The turret can traverse 360¬∞.MON Cyclic rate of fire is between 8 and 10 rounds per minute, with the gun returning to an elevation of +3¬∞ 30' to reload after each shot if the autoloader is used. It is fed from a forty-round mechanized conveyor double- row magazine located around the turret ring of the BMP-1. The gun is reloaded by the M3 electromechanical autoloader with ammunition conveyor, but can be reloaded by hand if necessary. The autoloader is not reliable; it can break down from vibration when the vehicle is moving at high speed over rough ground, and its operation is a danger to the gunner's fingers. With the autoloader, the gun has a rate of fire of 8 rounds per minute. These drawbacks caused the autoloader to be removed in Ob'yekt 765Sp3, Finnish BMP-1 and Swedish Pbv 501. Some units removed the autoloader altogether when new vehicles were delivered, but the mechanized ammunition conveyor magazine was retained. Ammunition Drawing of PG-9 HEAT projectile The 2A28 'Grom' smoothbore gun fires the same projectiles as the SPG-9 infantry light recoilless gun, but with a smaller propellant charge. Before 1974, the ammunition only consisted of high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds; the PG-15V HEAT fixed fin-stabilized rocket-assisted round. After 1974, OG-15V HE- Fragmentation projectiles were introduced. In the Ob'yekt 765Sp3, the standard ammunition load is 24 PG-15V HEAT rounds and 16 OG-15V HE-Frag rounds. The PG-15V HEAT round weighs and uses a PG-9 shell with a RDX explosive charge in the warhead.(1979) –ë–æ–µ–≤–∞—è –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ö–æ—Ç—ã –ë–ú–ü-1. –¢–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –ø–æ —ç–∫—Å–ø–ª—É–∞—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (Infantry Fighting Vehicle BMP-1.

They are stowed in two boxes under the main gun. The machine gun has a rate of fire of around 800 rounds a minute. The 2A28 \\"Grom\\" gun and PKT coaxial machine gun cannot be accurately fired while the vehicle is moving over rough ground. This means that the BMP-1's main armament is less capable than modern stabilised autocannons, which can be fired accurately while moving. The BMP-1 is unable to engage tanks and APCs using the 2A28 \\"Grom\\" gun from hull-down positions due to its limited depression, making it vulnerable to enemy fire.Global Security.

The keeper, Fiora, discovers that she has amazing but undisciplined laran powers. A Terran ship heads towards Cottman‚Äôs Star, seeking possible descendants of pre-Empire lost colony ships of the distant past. After observing the weather patterns and geography of the planet from space, a shuttle attempts to land. It crashes in the mountains during a snowstorm and is rescued by men from Aldaran. At Aldaran Castle, they are greeted by Kermiac of Aldaran, who can speak to Elizabeth because she is a telepath. Elizabeth explains that they are an expedition from the stars looking for descendants of the Lost Ships. Leonie Hastur perceives a threat coming to Darkover from one of the moons. She uses her laran to link to one of the minds on the Terran ship and listen to the crew conversations, though she does not understand all of what she hears. She reports to Keeper Fiora that strangers are lost in a storm near Aldaran. Leonie contacts her twin telepathically, and tells Lorill to go to Aldaran. After several days, Elizabeth tells Commander MacAran that Darkover should be considered a closed world, since otherwise, Darkover will simply be plundered. The others disagree. With Kermiac‚Äôs approval, the Terrans begin building a spaceport at the city of Caer Donn. Leonie is sent to Arilinn for more advanced training. She establishes a telepathic link with one of the Terrans, Ysaye Barnett, and they converse frequently. Ysaye introduces Leonie to Terran music. Elizabeth and Ysaye are deliberately exposed to kireseth pollen by Ryan Evans, a crew member who means them harm. Ysaye, with Leonie‚Äôs assistance, destroys Ryan Evans‚Äô experiments with the kireseth flowers. Evans attacks her and Leonie responds, using Ysaye‚Äôs body. Evans is killed. Ysaye is severely injured and eventually dies. Lorill Hastur reports to the Comyn Council his recommendation that they should have no contact with the Terrans.

The use of high temperature thermoplastics and their structured metallization opens a new dimension of circuit carrier design to the electronics industry. This technology combines plastic substrate/housing with circuitry into a single part by selective metallization. Applications Key markets for the MID technology are consumer electronic, telecommunication, automotive and medical. A very common application for MIDs are integrated antennas in cellphones and other mobile devices including laptops and netbooks. Manufacturing methods Molded interconnect devices are typically manufactured in these technologies: = Laser Direct Structuring (LDS) = The LDS process uses a thermoplastic material, doped with a (non-conductive) metallic inorganic compound activated by means of laser. The basic component is single-component injection molded, with practically no restrictions in terms of 3D design freedom. A laser then writes the course of the later circuit trace on the plastic. Where the laser beam hits the plastic the metal additive forms a micro-rough track. The metal particles of this track form the nuclei for the subsequent metallization. In an electroless copper bath, the conductor path layers arise precisely on these tracks. Successively layers of copper, nickel and gold finish can be raised in this way. The LDS process is characterized by: * single-component injection molding * a wide range of materials is available * full three-dimensionality in a sphere * flexibility: for a changed routing of traces, only new control data have to be transmitted to the laser unit. Thus different functional components can be produced from one basic unit * precision: finest conductor pathes with a width of < 80 ¬µm are possible * prototyping: available LDS- coating of any part enables test specimen Laser Direct Structuring was invented at Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe, University of Applied Sciences in Lemgo, Germany, from 1997 until 2001. LDS technology was developed in a research cooperation with the former LPKF Limited, patented by the inventors and first exclusively licensed to LPKF. In 2002 the patents concerning LDS technology were transferred to LPKF Laser & Electronics AG. The major drawbacks of LDS are the need for the expensive metallic inorganic compound for the entire mold, the necessity for a chemical plating process, a very rough surface of the plated layer making connectors difficult to achieve. The created circuitry usually is limited to only one layer of wiring without crosses. = Printed Electronics = Selective metallization can be achieved by printing of conductive traces (Printed Electronics) onto the surface of the thermoplastic part. Aerosol jet, inkjet, or screen printing may be used, whereas aerosol jet printing delivers the most reliable results on an arbitrary shaped mold. The main advantages to PE include: *any polymer can be used for injection molding * no metallic inorganic compound is necessary, which reduces cost *large variety of conductive coating materials including silver, copper, gold, platinum, graphite, and conductive polymers *thickness can be tightly controlled *direct deposition without plating possible *more complex circuitry possible as isolation layers, dielectrics, and other materials can be deposited in multiple layers *higher line precision of down to 10 ¬µm *higher surface smoothness Currently, printed electronics is still a research and development area but an increasing number of companies start production of smart phone antennas and substitute LDS on other injection- molded parts. The major drawback is a low level of standardization because of the versatility of the technique. = Two-shot molding = Two-shot molding is an injection molding process using two different resins and only one of the two resins is platable. Typically the platable substrate is ABS and the non- platable substrate is polycarbonate.

The Delaware nation was the first to sign a treaty with the new United States. They signed the treaty on the 17th September 1778. Despite the treaty, the Delaware were forced to cede their Eastern lands and moved first to Ohio, later Indiana (Plainfield), Missouri, Kansas, and Indian Territory. The ancestors of the Delaware Nation, following a different migration route, settled in Anadarko. Other Delaware bands moved north with the Iroquois after the American Revolutionary War to form two reserves in Ontario, Canada. Traditionally the Delaware were divided into the Munsee, Unami, and Unalachtigo, three social divisions determined by language and location.McCollum, Timothy James. Delaware, Western. Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture. (retrieved 5 August 2009) Federal recognition =First recognition= After dealing with the United States on a government-to-government basis, the ancestors of the Delaware Tribe of Indians agreed in 1867 to relocate to the Cherokee Nation in what was then Indian Territory. The Delaware Tribe of Indians operated autonomously within the lands of the Cherokee Nation. Following passage of the 1972 Appropriations Act, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reviewed the 1958 Bylaws of the Delaware Tribe of Indians. It recommended that the tribe adopt membership criteria to comply with the distribution requirements of the Act. In a General Council meeting, the Delaware Tribe amended its bylaws to include such criteria, and the BIA approved the amendments on September 30, 1974. In 1975, the BIA certified that the Delaware Tribe's amended bylaws provided \\"the legal entity which in the judgment of the Secretary of Interior adequately protects the interest of the Delaware Tribe of Indians pursuant to the [1972 Appropriations Act].\\" Due to suit filed by the Kansas Delaware, a non- recognized tribe, BIA reviewed all federally recognized Delaware tribes' legal documents. Then in 1979, BIA revoked the Delaware Tribe of Indians' status, citing that the removal to Oklahoma in 1879 with the Cherokees effectively placed the tribe under the authority of the Cherokee Nation. The BIA had determined that the Department of the Interior would generally engage in government-to-government relations with the Delaware Tribe only indirectly through Cherokee Nation, and that the Department would engage in direct relations with the Delaware Tribe solely with respect to the Tribe's claims against the United States. =Second recognition= The Delaware Tribe of Indians regained their federal recognition by the Secretary of the Interior in 1991, when the BIA rescinded their 1979 decision. However, the Cherokee Nation disagreed with the decision and filed suit against the BIA and the Secretary of their decision. The Cherokee Nation's position was upheld in court, leading to the Delaware Tribe's loss of federal recognition in 2004. After years of negotiations, the two tribes resolved their differences through an agreement in October 2008. Delaware voters approved the agreement and voted to reorganize in May 2009, under the authority of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act. =Third recognition= On July 28, 2009, The United States Department of the Interior notified the tribal office in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, that the Delaware are again a federally recognized tribe.Delaware Tribe of Indians‚Äô federal recognition restored.

In addition, that same year Tompkins prepared the then two-year-old Crusader who would earn 1926 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and Horse of the Year honors. For 1925, Gwyn Tompkins was the United States Champion Thoroughbred Trainer by earnings. A story in the November 1, 1925 issue of the Chicago Daily Tribune was headlined: America's Leading Race Trainer Near Death at Laurel. Tompkins recovered from his illness but five weeks later the New York Times reported that he had resigned as trainer for Glen Riddle Farm due to his health problems.

The Almanac is broken down alphabetically by constituency, with additional material offering regional surveys of the previous election, statistical data about the seats such as those with the highest working-class population or the fewest students, the youngest and oldest and longest serving MPs. It is particularly concerned to offer a guide to the likely political characteristics of the new seats created by the regular boundary changes or redistricting of constituencies (such as in 1983, 1997, 2005 in Scotland only, and forthcoming in the UK general election which must take place in late 2009 or 2010) The idea of the Almanac was initiated by Robert Waller, a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford University, in 1983, acknowledging its debt to The Almanac of American Politics, co-authored by Michael Barone and others since 1972 (also still in regular publication). Since the fifth edition (1996) Waller has been joined by a co-author responsible for profiles of MPs by Byron Criddle, Reader in politics at Aberdeen University. Each edition is rewritten to reflect changing election results and prospects. The 8th and last edition (to date) of the Almanac, published in 2007, is 1,081 pages long. Despite its bulk, the book is known also as a guide to the nature of the United Kingdom in a broader sense than the merely political, and also for Byron Criddle's sometimes controversial and acerbic pen-portraits of politicians. According to the cover blurb of the 7th edition (2002), the broadcaster Jeremy Paxman described it as ‚Äòa fountain of arcana and attitude‚Äô. The Almanac contains the following tabular and statistical information: Constituency tables * The 10 seats with the highest %: of students; of the nine Experian Social Groups (top 20 for ‚ÄòUrban Intelligence‚Äô). * The 20 seats with the highest %: of employed in manufacturing industry; pensioners; single-parent households; non-white residents; * The 20 seats with the highest / lowest %: of owner occupied households; of professional/managerial workers; and household disposable income per week; * The 20 seats with the highest / lowest: house prices; and house price % increase 2003‚Äì06; * The 20 seats with the lowest: % of 18-year- olds in higher education. * The 30 seats with the highest unemployment 2006. * The most marginal and safest constituencies - 2005 general election - by party. * The seats with over 10% Muslim / Hindu / Sikh / Jewish residents.

It takes its name from the Senecio genus and is produced by many different plants in that genus, including Jacobaea vulgaris (Senecio jacobaea). It has also been isolated from several other plants, including Brachyglottis repanda, Emilia, Erechtites hieraciifolius, Petasites, Syneilesis, Crotalaria, Caltha leptosepala, and Castilleja. The compound is toxic and consumption can lead to liver damage, cancer, and pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis. Because of this, consumption of plants that produce it has resulted in poisonings, both in humans and in animals. Toxicity Like other pyrrolizidine alkaloids, senecionine is toxic when ingested. The ingested molecule is a protoxin that is metabolized to its active form. In large quantities, ingestion can lead to critical illness, including convulsions and death. Studies in rodents have shown an LD50 of 65 mg/kg. In smaller, non- lethal quantities, ingestion can lead to intoxication, although clinical signs and symptoms may not present until months after exposure depending on the level of exposure. Ingestion can lead to both liver and DNA damage. =Liver toxicity= The liver damage in both acute and chronic intoxication can cause hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOS), signs and symptoms of which include nausea, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and bloody diarrhea. Additionally, acute intoxication can cause hemorrhagic necrosis and liver failure, with signs and symptoms including weight loss, jaundice, depression, behavior changes, and ascites. Photosensitive dermatitis may also be seen. Other symptoms and manifestations of chronic exposure include weakness, portal hypertension, and cirrhosis. =DNA damage= Senecionine ingestion can also induce DNA damage. Although there are few if any cases of human cancers directly linked to senecionine intoxication, rodent studies have shown that it is capable of inducing tumor formation in the liver, lung, skin, brain, spinal cord, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. =Diagnosis= Diagnosis of senecionine toxicity is made based on history, physical examination, and liver biopsy. Lab findings may include increased bile acid concentrations, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia, and abormal liver function tests (LFTs). However, it has been observed that chronically exposed animals may have normal lab values for months to years despite ongoing liver damage. Histological abnormalities on biopsy include megalocytosis, necrosis, fibrosis, and biliary hyperplasia, similar to other hepatotoxic ingestions and immune system disorders. =Other Bioactivity= Senecionine has also been evaluated as an anti-microbial. A cocktail of pyrrolizidine alkaloids with senecionine in it has been shown to be toxic to Fusarium fungi at millimolar concentrations. Treatment There are currently no known available drugs or antidotes to treat senecionine poisoning. Treatment is supportive to permit liver regeneration, which may include administration of intravenous (IV) fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, IV glucose, and wound care with antibiotics if dermatitis is a presenting symptom. Additionally, albumin infusions may be used to reduce ascites. Prevention remains the best method to reduce senecionine posionings, including avoiding consumption of senecionine- containing plants and pesticide use to kill infestations of those plants. Biosynthesis and Chemistry In Senecio species, biosynthesis of senecionine starts from L-arginine or L-ornithine. Because plants don't have decarboxylase enzyme for L-ornithine, it must be first converted into L-arginine. Arginine can then be readily converted to putrescine and spermidine. Next, in an NAD+-dependent reaction catalyzed by homospermidine synthase (HSS), an aminopropyl group from putrescine is transferred to spermidine to form homospermidine, releasing 1,3-diaminopropane (see biosynthesis scheme). HSS is the only enzyme that has been definitively implicated in this biosynthesis. Homospermidine is then oxidized and subsequently cyclized to form the stereospecific pyrrolizidine backbone. The aldehyde is then reduced and then the pyrrolizidine core is desaturated and hydroxylated through yet undetermined mechanisms to form retronecine. Retronecine is acylated by senecic acid, formed from two equivalents of L-isoleucine. This step forms the N-oxide of senecionine, which is subsequently reduced to yield senecionine. Senecionine has a core structure of retronecine, an unsaturated pyrrolizide, with a 12-membered lactone ring attached to the core. The nitrogen atom in the pyrrolizidine core is weakly basic with an estimated pKa of 5.9. Biosynthesis of senecionine Metabolism and Mechanism of Action After oral ingestion, senecionine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When it reaches the liver, it is metabolized via three pathways: N-oxidation, oxidation, and ester hydrolysis. N-oxidation and hydrolysis are detoxification pathways, and the products of these reactions are conjugated and excreted by the kidneys. However, the N-oxide may be converted back into senecionine by cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) monooxygenases. Oxidation of senecionine to its respective dehydropyrrolizidine is responsible for its toxic effects. In the toxic pathway, the 2-pyrroline in the core is desaturated via an oxidation reaction to form a pyrrolic ester. This metabolite can still subsequently be eliminated if it is conjugated to glutathione. However, this metabolite is toxic because it can act as an electrophile. It may be attacked by either DNA base pairs or by amino acid residues in liver proteins, resulting in the formation of toxic adducts, including cross-linked adducts between DNA base pairs, liver proteins, or both. These adducts can damage DNA, leading to genotoxicity and carcinogenesis, and liver enzymes and hepatocytes, leading to hepatotoxicity. Metabolism and mechanism of action of pyrrolizidine alkaloid toxicity. Nuc=nucleophilic protein residue or DNA base Biology and Society defense mechanism and to make pheromones The Senecio plants groundsel and ragwort are both common and are found in many regions, most commonly as weeds on cultivated ground. Common ragwort is especially prevalent in Europe and has been responsible for livestock poisoning and deaths when it is consumed. In Africa, Australia, and the United States, Crotalaria species, shrub-like herbs, have been found to be responsible for similar livestock deaths. Horses seem to be particularly vulnerable to senecionine poisoning through ingestion of ragwort. Symptoms of poisoning in horses (known as \\"horse staggers\\") include nervousness, yawning, fatigue, and unsteady gait. Some species have evolved to leverage senecionine for their own benefit. Danaus chrysippus butterflies can safely consume senecionine-containing plants, making them taste very bitter and thus unpalatable to predators. This adaptation is also present in grasshoppers of the genus Zonocerus and the caterpillars of the Cinnabar moth. Additionally, D. chrysippus are able to convert senecionine to pheromones necessary for successful mating. Consequently, experiments have shown that males deprived of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, including senecionine, in their diets are less successful at mating. Senecionine-containing herbs have been used in folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, hemorrhage, hypertension, and as a uterine stimulant, despite no documented evidence that it is effective for any of those conditions and overwhelming evidence of its toxicity. In humans, bread contaminated with ragwort has caused senecionine poisonings (a condition colloquially known as \\"bread poisoning\\" in South Africa). In the West Indies, poisonings have been reported from the consumption of herbal teas made with Crotalaria.

Its fundamental meaning is the putting together of components in appropriate relationships or structures, according to a formula. Etymologically formula is the diminutive of the Latin forma, meaning shape. In that sense a formulation is created according to the standard for the product. Abstract applications Disciplines in which one might use the word formulation in the abstract sense include logic, mathematics, linguistics, legal theory, and computer science. For details, see the related articles. Material applications In more material senses the concept of formulation appears in the physical sciences, such as physics, chemistry, and biology. It also is ubiquitous in industry, engineering and medicine, especially pharmaceutics.  Pharmacy  In pharmacy, a formulation is a mixture or a structure such as a capsule, tablet, or an emulsion, prepared according to a specific procedure (called a \\"formula\\"). Formulations are a very important aspect of creating medicines, since they are essential to ensuring that the active part of the drug is delivered to the correct part of the body, in the right concentration, and at the right rate (not too fast and not too slowly). A good example is a drug delivery system that exploits supersaturation.

It is used commercially as a violet dye and experimentally as a pH indicator, appearing yellow below pH 11, and violet above pH 13. It also turns deep blue in the presence of magnesium salt in a slightly alkaline, or basic, environment. Azo violet may also be used to test for the presence of ammonium ions. The color of ammonium chloride or ammonium hydroxide solution will vary depending upon the concentration of azo violet used.  Properties  Azo violet at pH ~7. The intense color from which the compound gets its name results from irradiation and subsequent excitation and relaxation of the extended œÄ electron system across the R-N=N-R‚Äô linked phenols. Absorption of these electrons falls in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Azo violet's intense indigo color (Œªmax 432 nm) approximates Pantone R: 102 G: 15 B: 240.  Synthesis  Azo violet can be synthesised by reacting 4-nitroaniline with nitrous acid (generated in situ with an acid and a nitrite salt) to produce a diazonium intermediate. This is then reacted with resorcinol, dissolved in a sodium hydroxide solution, via an azo coupling reaction. ::600px This is consistent with the generalized strategy for preparing azo dyes. ::400px  Reactivity  Tautomerization of Azo Violet The chemical character of azo violet may be attributed to its azo group (-N=N-), six-membered rings, and hydroxyl side groups. Due to steric repulsions, azo violet is most stable in the trans-configuration, but isomerization of azo dyes by irradiation is not uncommon. The para-position tautomerization of azo violet provides mechanical insight into the behavior of the compound in an acidic environment, and thus its use as a basic pH indicator. The predicted 1H-NMR of pure azo violet shows the hydroxyl protons as the most deshielded and acidic protons. The participation of these hydroxyl groups' electron- donation to the conjugated œÄ system likewise influences azo violet's Œªmax and pKa value.

Born in Guayub√≠n, he threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as tall and . An older brother, Diomedes, was also a major league pitcher. Career \\"Chi-Chi\\" Olivo was 27 years old when he signed with the Milwaukee Braves prior to the 1955 season, and was 33 when he made his major league debut on June 5, 1961. He gave up a home run to the very first batter he faced, Jerry Lynch. He returned to the mound again the next day, and surrendered three earned runs in just a third of an inning. He pitched once more three days later, but would not return to the majors for another three years. He stumbled in his first two outings of 1964, but settled down substantially from there. Over the month of July, Olivo had a 1.93 earned run average, and held opposing hitters to a .216 batting average. Both of his first two career wins against the New York Mets on July 26 in a doubleheader at Shea Stadium. Overall, he went 2‚Äì1 with a 3.75 ERA and five saves. After two April appearances in 1965, Olivo was demoted to the Triple-A Atlanta Crackers. He dominated the International League with a 9‚Äì2 record and 1.74 ERA to earn a call back up to Milwaukee that September. He was equally dominant, pitching 9 innings, and allowing just one earned run. That one run came against the Los Angeles Dodgers courtesy of a Maury Wills infield bunt single in extra innings. After reaching first, Wills stole second, and came around to score on a two out single by Lou Johnson off Dick Kelley to give Olivo his only loss on the season. Olivo's final major league season was 1966 for the newly relocated Atlanta Braves. He went 5‚Äì4 with a 4.23 ERA and seven saves. That winter, he and outfielder Bill Robinson were dealt to the New York Yankees for third baseman Clete Boyer. He pitched one season for the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs, going 3‚Äì0 with a 1.59 ERA in nine starts. In his 96 MLB games, all in relief, Olivo compiled a 7‚Äì6 record with 12 saves and a 3.96 career earned run average. He allowed 129 hits and 50 bases on balls, with 98 strikeouts, in 141 innings pitched. Olivo also pitched in the Dominican Professional Baseball League for the Tigres del Licey, Aguilas Cibae√±as and Estrellas Orientales, and the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League with the Criollos de Caguas.

Built in 1898 as part of a major improvement on navigational aids on the river, they are the only surviving pair of range lights in the state. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kennebec River Light Station on January 21, 1988. Description and history The Doubling Point Range Lights are located on the lower Kennebec River, at a point where the normally south-flowing river makes a sharp turn to the east, followed by a turn back to the south. The range lights are set on the north side of the second turn; the first is marked by the Doubling Point Light. The range lights are oriented so that they are in alignment when seen from the main channel to the south. The light station consists of two octagonal wood frame towers, a keeper's house, and an oil house. The towers are joined to the keeper's house by wooden walkways with railings. The southern tower is in height, while the northern one is tall. When a ship is properly in the main channel, only the southern light will be visible. The keeper's house stands west and a little north of the southern light. It is an L-shaped wood frame structure, with a hip roof and a granite foundation. It has enclosed hip-roofed porches on its east and west sides. The oil house, standing further west of the house, is a small brick structure, with a gable roof, a narrow vent in one of the gable ends, and a centrally placed door. The range lights were established in 1898, fifteen years after the founding of the Bath Iron Works, a major shipbuilder, one and a half miles upriver.

Like the American gizzard shad, the threadfin shad has an elongated dorsal ray, but unlike the gizzard shad, its mouth is more terminal without a projecting upper jaw. The fins of threadfin shad often have a yellowish color, especially the caudal fin. The back is grey to blue with a dark spot on the shoulder. D. petenense is more often found in moving water, and is rarely found deep in the water column. It occurs in large schools, sometimes with gizzard shad, and can be seen on the surface at dawn and dusk. The threadfin shad may reach lengths of , but only rarely. This fish is very sensitive to changes in temperature and dissolved oxygen, and die-offs are frequent in late summer and fall, especially when water temperature drops to 42¬∞F. The threadfin shad is a favorite food for many game fishes, including striped bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and catfish. This fish is widely introduced throughout the United States as a forage for game fish. Geographic distribution The threadfin shad is native to the U.S., west of the eastern Appalachian Mountains. This species tends to do best in large lakes and rivers. The construction of dams has created more reservoirs, providing more water bodies for the shad to inhabit. This has expanded the home range of the fish, as has the rise in temperatures in northern lakes.Green, B. W., et al. (2010). Threadfin shad impacts phytoplankton and zooplankton community structures in channel catfish ponds. Aquaculture Research 41:e524-e536. Ecology The adult may reach up to 8 in long, but most shad are about 1 in long. It feeds on plankton near the surface of the water late in the day.Mettee, M. F., et al. Fishes of Alabama and the Mobile Basin. Birmingham, Alabama. Oxmoor House, Inc. 1996. It is a very important food source for many game fish such as the largemouth bass. It has little known competition, but one species known to have a similar lifestyle is the gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum). The threadfin lives a pelagic life in reservoirs and for the most part in large streams. Life history The shad spawns in the spring when the water temperature is in the upper 60s (¬∞F). A pelagic (open water) schooling species often introduced as a supplemental forage, threadfin shad spawn in the spring and early summer with a secondary spawn often occurring in the early fall. Spawning usually occurs early in the morning on available vegetation. The eggs adhere to submerged and floating objects. Females lay from 2,000 to 24,000 eggs. The young and adults feed on a variety of planktonic organisms and organic debris. Many researchers believe that threadfin shad often compete for plankton with young-of-the-year predator species, especially largemouth bass. Life expectancy seldom exceeds 2 to 3 years.Higginbotham, B. Forage Species: Range, Description, and Life History. Oklahoma State University. Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service. Current management Many populations of threadfin shad have been introduced by humans to the far north, resulting in large die-offs in the winter when water temperatures fall below 42¬∞F. This die-off affects both humans and wildlife. A tide of dead fish floats ashore, creating a strong odor unpleasant to humans. The die-off also gives some bird species an unnatural feeding habit, as well. The species should not be transplanted into water bodies that drop below 42¬∞F. This species is not endangered and has relatively healthy populations.

It was established in 1898, fifteen years after the founding of the Bath Iron Works, a major shipbuilder, upriver. It was part of a major upgrade of the river's lights  the Doubling Point Light and the separate Range Lights on the point, Perkins Island Light, and Squirrel Point Light were all built at the same time. The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Doubling Point Light Station on January 21, 1988. It remains an active aid to navigation. Description and history The Doubling Point Light is located on the lower Kennebec River, at a point where the normally south- flowing river makes a sharp turn to the east, followed by a turn back to the south. The light is set at the inside corner of the first of these turns, on the west side of Arrowsic Island, roughly opposite the mouth of Winnegance Creek. The light station includes a tower, keeper's house, shed, and oil house. The tower is an octagonal wood frame structure, finished in wooden shingles, with an iron walkway around the lantern chamber. It is accessed via a three-span footbridge. Near the tower is the keeper's house, an L-shaped 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with hip-roofed porches. Also nearby are the gable-roofed tool shed, built in 1898, and the small brick oilhouse, added in 1906. The city of Bath, located north (upriver) from this point, had been a major shipbuilding port for much of the 19th century, and the river was a major transportation artery all the way to Augusta. In 1892 the river below Bath was identified by the United States Lighthouse Board as needing improved navigational aids, and a series of improvements were authorized. Funding was made available by Congress in 1895, and Doubling Point Light was built in 1898, along with the keeper's house and shed. The tower did not originally stand at its present location, to which it was moved in 1899, and the keeper's house was moved closer to the tower in 1901. The tower's original lens was a fifth-order Fresnel lens; it was automated in 1988.

It was first published in the 1910 edition of The Century Magazine. and later reprinted in her books The Collected Short Stories of Edith Wharton and Tales of Men and Ghosts (1910). It is an ironic ghost story about greed and retribution. The ghost comes for one of the main characters long after a business transgression where the character wronged another. Summary =Part I= She recalls a conversation that she and her husband, Ned Boyne, had with their cousin Alida Stair six months earlier. The conversation centered on their search for a house in a southern or southwestern county in England. Alida suggested Lyng in Dorsetshire, after they had turned down several more suitable suggestions. Lyng is old, isolated, and in disrepair and they are attracted to it because of the ‚Äúcharm of having been for centuries a deep dim reservoir of life.Oates, p.131‚Äù They only wanted the house if it was haunted. Legend has it that the inhabitants of Lyng don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve encountered the ghost until long afterward. Mary reflected on the legend with a new ‚Äúperception of its significanceOates, p.129‚Äù because of her husband‚Äôs disappearance. The Boyne‚Äôs were nouveau riche because of a business deal made by Ned and were looking for a place to pursue their dream of a life of leisure. They wanted to sit ‚Äúin the thick December dusk, by just such a wide-hooded fireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkened to a deeper solitude.Oates, p.131‚Äù Mary recalls that her husband seemed withdrawn and worried earlier in the month but she did not question him about it and he did not reveal why he was upset. As she is reflecting on that day, she recalls an event two months prior, in October, where she had accidentally come across a hidden stairwell that led to a flat ledge on the roof. She remembers that she and Ned climbed the stairs to take in the view and that as they were reveling in the beautiful landscape, a stranger approached. Mary remembers noticing that Ned became perplexed and suddenly fled. At the time of the incident, Mary gave it no more thought because there were various tradesmen coming and going each day working on the house and Ned redirected Mary‚Äôs concern with a trip to Meldon Steep. Now, however, she recalls the anxiety that was evident on Ned‚Äôs face. =Part II= Mary recalls a day, earlier in December, where she noticed a figure coming up the walk. She thought it was the ghost but it turned out to be her husband (a bit of foreshadowing). She remembers being determined to find out what was bothering Ned and intentionally asking him while they were sitting in the library if he had seen the ghost yet. He replied that he had not. She remembers noticing a change in his demeanor as he opened his mail that evening. He seemed to be relieved of whatever burden he was carrying. She recalls feeling relieved at the change until she opened her mail. Someone sent her a newspaper clipping about the suit that a man named Elwell brought against Ned concerning the Blue Star Mine business deal. When Mary questioned Ned about it, he diffused her queries with ‚ÄúI thought that kind of thing bored youOates, p.139‚Äù and he told her the suit had been withdrawn, but he did not reveal why. Mary remembers feeling a stab of guilt at not taking an interest in her husband‚Äôs business affairs. =Part III= She remembers waking up the next day, feeling refreshed at the change in Ned. She reasoned that she did not have to know about his affairs because she trusted him implicitly and decided to work on her garden. She recalls that a stranger approached and inquired about her husband so she directed him to the library to find Ned. She did not give the encounter much thought until later that day after she learns that Ned left with the stranger. She recalls feeling very uneasy with each passing hour because Ned did not return. She remembers going into the library to search for clues to his absence and finding a cryptic note that reads: ‚ÄúMy dear Parvis, I have just received your letter announcing Elwell‚Äôs death, and while I suppose there is now no further risk of trouble, it might be safer ‚Äì.Oates, p.146-147‚Äú Mary disregarded the note at the time but continued to search for clues. She remembers the dread she felt when she realized that Ned left with the stranger. =Part IV= Mary recalls the widespread search by the authorities for Ned. She remembers searching and finding the note to Parvis again and contacting him. He did not have any information to impart. Mary remembers feeling the gradual acceptance of her situation, she became ‚Äúdomesticated with the Horror, accepting its perpetual presence as one of the fixed conditions of life.Oates, p.150‚Äù She remembers reasoning that ‚Äúno one would ever knowOates, p.150‚Äù what happened to Ned but that ‚Äúthe house knew.Oates, p.150\\" Mary recalls thinking that the house was ‚Äúmute accompliceOates, p.151‚Äù in Ned‚Äôs disappearance. =Part V= Mary recalls Parvis‚Äô visit and his explanation of the events at the Blue Star Mine. She finally learned about the bad business deal that destroyed Elwell‚Äôs life and puts the events together when she sees a picture of Elwell. The legend had come true and she finally realizes that the ghost of Lyng had appeared and taken Ned away. Analysis The story is divided into five parts and is told as an exploration of the memories of the central character with several instances of foreshadowing. The dynamic plot starts at the end and bounces back and forth throughout time within a six- month period. An unnamed narrator in third person limited omniscience point of view tells the story. There are several conflicts throughout the story, both internal and external, which include: woman against self, woman against another, woman against society, man against self, man against another, man against society. The focus of the narration is on the central character, Mary Boyne. She is happy to know nothing of her husband‚Äôs business affairs until he goes missing. Her mood transforms from happy to worried and then sad by the end of the story. Mary is the wife of Ned. He is a businessman who strikes it rich in the states and moves his wife to England. He is secretive and his mood transforms from happy to forlorn in a matter of three months. The secrets that he keeps from Mary are his downfall. The setting is on old house name Lyng in Dorsetshire, England. The house is in disrepair and the location is remote. The narrator alludes to darkness and history throughout the story, which contributes to the dark and secretive atmosphere. There is irony in the story. The irony is that they brought the ghost with them. The ghost appears to the house‚Äôs inhabitants but they do not realize it until long after the damage is done. The Boynes bought the house because of the ghost and the ghost took Ned away, in effect wrecking their idyllic life. Adaptations ‚ÄúAfterward‚Äù is the fourth episode of the short film DVD series Shades of Darkness ‚Äì Six Mysterious Tales of Paranormal. The plot retells the story making Mary and Ned Boyne a young newlywed couple who buy a house is the south of England that is haunted and they regret it. ] There is an audio book version of ‚ÄúAfterward‚Äù available on Librivox. Each chapter is read and recorded by volunteers across America.http://librivox.org/afterward-by-edith-wharton/ The story has also been adapted for the radio and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

It is situated within the civil parish of the area of Boho, as well as Fermanagh and Omagh district. The Coal Bog road travels through this townland and the adjacent townland of Drumacoorin. This is a traditional peat cutting area and in past times was the main highway between Lough MacNean and Lough Erne. The area is particularly notable for the remnants of a Neolithic settlement found in the coal bog. An impressive bronze spearhead was also found in this area and is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland.  Neolithic site  On 25 May 1880, a local person known as Mr Bothwell was cutting his turf when he unearthed the ancient site. He immediately sent for the arch√¶ologist Thomas Plunkett, who identified the remains as being a Neolithic settlement, situated on what was once an island or crannog in the midst of a body of water. The dimensions of the crannog were long and wide. The settlement contained two oak wood huts, the larger measuring square, and lay buried at least , below the original surface of the bog. The huts themselves were dated at this time to approximately 4000 years old. The modern whereabouts of this settlement are now unknown, but artefacts from the site are retained in the National Museum of Ireland, including the handle of a stone axe.

He played at scrum-half, for Gala RFC at club level and was capped at international level for Scotland. While he had a short and quiet international career, he served in the administrative offices of the Scottish Rugby Union in the late 1990s. Playing career Paterson earned his first international cap for Scotland against South Africa in December 1969. During the high-point of his career, Paterson started all of his country's matches during the 1971 Five Nations Championship. His most memorable match took place that same year against England at Twickenham Stadium, where the Scots had not won since 1938. With Scotland trailing 5-9 early in the first half, Paterson picked up a loose ball near the centre of the pitch following a line-out, and successfully booted a drop-goal. With about six minutes remaining in the match, however, England held a 15-8 advantage. Paterson, receiving the ball from a ruck, box- kicked the ball down the right-hand touch line, where Billy Steele appeared to knock it on. No knock-on was called however, and in a moment of hesitation by the English backs, Paterson swooped in and dotted the ball down for a try. Scotland went on to win 16-15 on a Peter Brown conversion of Chris Rea's last- minute try. These would be the only points which Duncan Paterson scored for his country. After the 1971 Calcutta Cup match at Twickenham, Paterson was in the match against England at Murrayfield that next week. The match was the hundredth anniversary of Rugby's first international. Scotland defeated England for 26-6. Rugby administrator With his international playing career behind him, Paterson turned his attention to a successful career in business, primarily in the knitwear and property sectors. In 1986 Paterson's role within the Scottish Rugby Union began in earnest when he was elected to the union's general committee. In 1990 he then succeeded Bob Munro as the team manager of the Scottish national team. Paterson steered the Scottish team through two Rugby World Cups, the team reaching the semi-finals in 1991 and the quarter-finals in 1995. He was also the team manager for the 1993 Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament, which was held in Scotland. He is the uncle of Chris Paterson, Scottish rugby's all-time leading points scorer.

He played college football as an offensive and defensive end for the University of Michigan (1951‚Äì1953) and professional football as a defensive end for the Green Bay Packers (1954‚Äì1956). As a senior at Michigan, Knutson was selected to play in the Hula Bowl College All-Star Game. Early years in Beloit Knutson was born in Beloit, Wisconsin in 1932. He was the son of Florence and Peter Knutson. He began playing football at Lincoln High School in Beloit. At Beloit Memorial High School, he played football, basketball and track and field. He earned seven varsity letters and won all-state honors in both football and basketball and was a hurdler on Beloit's state championship track team as a junior. Knutson graduated from Beloit High School in 1950. One of his teammates later recalled, \\"Gene was probably one of the best all-around athletes Beloit High School ever had.\\" University of Michigan Knutson enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1950. After his freshman season, Michigan head coach Bennie Oosterbaan said that Knutson was \\"unquestionably Michigan's outstanding freshman prospect.\\" He sustained a broken leg in April 1951 while stepping off a curb, but he recovered in time for the 1951 football season. Knutson played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1951 to 1953. He played at the offensive and defensive end position for Michigan. By his senior year, he was 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighed 230 pounds. In October 1953, he caught a 29-yard touchdown pass on fourth down in the fourth quarter to help Michigan to a 14-13 victory over Iowa. He was selected as an All-Midwest player and played in the college all-star Hula Bowl. Knutson later recalled the first time he ran out of the tunnel into Michigan Stadium in front of 100,000 fans: \\"That was such a thrill to me, so exciting. How could I ever explain that to someone? Unless you experience sitting in that locker room, getting dressed, warming up and then going out to that crowd and playing in that ballgame, you'll never know. It was exhilarating.\\" Green Bay Packers Knutson was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 10th round (111th overall pick) of the 1954 NFL Draft. He played as a defensive end for the Packers, appearing in 18 games during the 1954 and 1956 NFL seasons. Knutson did not play for the Packers in 1955 after suffering an injury in an exhibition game against the Washington Redskins. His highest annual salary as a professional athlete was $8,000. Knutson later recalled his days in the NFL as follows: \\"It was more of a business - dog eat dog. When I played there were only 12 teams and the (roster) limit was 33. It was a lot harder to get on a pro roster than it is now. I would love to be coming out of college now.\\" Later years After the 1956 season, Knutson retired from football due to chronic knee problems. He taught and coached at St. Joseph's High School in South Bend, Indiana, before entering the insurance business. He also worked as an executive vice president for Ara Parseghian Enterprises. In his later years, he lived in Cassopolis, Michigan. Family and death In 1953, Knutson married the former Carol Buschbaum of South Bend, Indiana. His first wife died in 1982, and in 1995, Knutson married Vicki Futterknecht of Cassopolis. Knutson died of cancer in February 2008 at Cassopolis.

He is one of the three co-authors of the Turkish National Anthem, as he made the arrangements for orchestra.  Family  Of Armenian descent, Edgar's father, Alexandre Manas, was the chief translator for the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. The family lineage may be traced back to Caesarea (now Kayseri), where it originated in the mid-sixteenth century. Raphael Manas (c.1710 - 1790), an official painter of the Ottoman Empire, was arguably the most outstanding figure of the Manas dynasty: he made the portraits of Mahmud I, Osman III and Mustafa III.Mayda Saris (2005). Armenian Painting: From the Beginning to the Present. Agos Press, Istanbul, pp. 107-9. .  Early life  Edgar Manas was born on April 12, 1875 in Istanbul.

While in Venice he also took piano lessons with Professor Trivellini. Upon graduating in 1894, he returned to his native city. Yet, his impulse to continue his music studies took him back to Italy, where he settled in Padua and worked with composer Luigi Bottazzo,:it:Luigi Bottazzo focusing on harmony, counterpoint and fugue.  Professional career  Back in Istanbul, Manas pursued his music studies further. He concentrated primarily on composition by examining the classics and the works of contemporary French masters. He produced a series of piano composition in the idiom of Chopin, including ‚ÄúMinuet-Valse‚Äù which was published in 1905 by A. ComendingerB√ºlent Alaner (1986).

During the same year, Edgar Manas conducted the Gallia choral group in a concert at Salle de f√™tes de l'Union fran√ßaise, a local auditorium, which earned him the order of Officier d‚Äôacad√©mie:fr:Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques from the French government. In 1912, Manas made the acquaintance of Komitas, the founder of modern Armenian music. Although their relationship was cordial, it was not particularly close, for Manas and Komitas lived in two different aesthetic worlds.’ë’´÷Å’´’¨’´’° ‘≤÷Ä’∏÷Ç’ø’•’°’∂ (1968). ’ç÷É’µ’∏÷Ç’º÷Ñ’´ ’∞’°’µ ’•÷Ä’°’™’´’∑’ø’∂’•÷Ä’®. ¬´’Ä’°’µ’°’Ω’ø’°’∂¬ª ’∞÷Ä’°’ø’°÷Ä’°’Ø’π’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂, ‘µ÷Ä÷á’°’∂. p 406. The same year, Leipzig-based Breitkopf & H√§rtel published two of Edgar Manas's compositions ‚Äì Suite for piano and String Quartet. It was followed by other European publishing houses, including Salabert,The New Music Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980). Vol XVI, p 409. SenardThe New Music Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980). Vol XVII, p 126. and Hamelle.The New Music Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980). Vol VIII, p 69. Manas's music was performed often in Istanbul, and, on occasion, in European music capitals. The String Quartet, mentioned above, was premiered in an all-Manas program on May 6, 1921 at Union fran√ßaise. Members of the quartet were violinists Ekrem Zeki √ún:tr:Ekrem Zeki √ún and Krikor Garabedian, violist Diran Israelian and cellist Kalayov. On this occasion, the composer performed his Piano Suite and accompanied soprano A. Khandjian in a number of songs. A few years later, the Quartet was performed in Leipzig with much success. Martin Friedland wrote the following in Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik:April 21, 1923, p 184. Dieses Quartett ... entstammt klassizistisch-neuromantischer Gef√ºhls- und Gedankensph√§re. Es beginnt mit einer Fughetta, die sich auf rhythmisch-charaktervollem Thema aufbaut, und l√§√üt ein pr√§gnantes, gedrungenes Stakkatoscherzo mit einem kantablen Lento an Trio-stelle folgen. Ein kurzes, ‚ÄúLied‚Äù benanntes, gro√üe melodische B√∂gen spannendes Adagio folgt als dritter Satz, und ein schwung- und temperamentvoll dahin-str√∂mendes ‚ÄúFinale‚Äù, voll inneren Lebens, beschlie√üt das knapp gehaltene Werk. Ohne harmonisch oder formell Neuland zu suchen, zeigt es die Hand eines mit der Eigenart des Quartettstiles wohlvertrauten Musikers, der vortreffliche thematische Arbeit leistet und an ehrlichem, jeglicher Affektation abholdem Bilden und Gestalten Gen√ºge findet.

A piece as worthy of hearing as it is of playing.) Manas was soon appointed to the directorship of the Lyre (’î’∂’°÷Ä ) chorus, associated with Armenian Youth League of Istanbul. Between the years 1920 ‚Äì 22, he became affiliated with the Devotee of the Arts (‘±÷Ä’∏÷Ç’•’Ω’ø’°’Ω’ß÷Ä) music organization, conducting their annual presentations. During the final concert on January 20, 1922, the program included Manas's own composition, My Death (¬´‘ª’¥ ’¥’°’∞’®¬ª), in addition to works from the standard repertoire. Manas was engaged to teach music at the Esayan Armenian day school and was hired by the D√¢r√ºlelhan)Istanbul Municipal Conservatory (the precursor of the Istanbul State Conservatoryhttp://www.istanbul.edu.tr/english/socrates/faculty22.htm in 1923 to conduct the orchestra and establish the first women's choir in the newly founded Turkish Republic. Manas also taught harmony at the Bahariye Mektep Bandosu and Orkestrasƒ± (Bahariye School Band and Orchestra). The vocal- symphonic ensemble of the conservatory presented its first concert at the historic Galatasaray High School on March 28, 1924. The program included excerpts from Saint-Sa√´ns‚Äôs Samson et Dalila, Meyerbeer‚Äôs L'Africaine, Brahms‚Äô N√§nie, as well as purely orchestral works by Gluck, Schmitt, Schumann and Mendelssohn. In 1923, Hamelle published a collection of songs by Manas, which were based on Armenian poetry but were presented in their French translation by Yetvart Kolandjian. In 1924, it was followed by the publication of his Sonata for violin and piano, premiered to critical acclaim on December 19, 1932 at the main auditorium of the Paris Conservatoire. Kevork Sinanian was the violinist and the composer was at the piano. In February 1926, Salabert of Paris printed Manas's piano work, Les √Æles des princes (Princes' Islands). The composition consisted of four movements, each portraying one of the main islands of the archipelago in the Sea of Marmara. Manas soon made an orchestral version of the work. Edgar Manas perhaps is best remembered for his work on ƒ∞stiklal Mar≈üƒ±, the Turkish National Anthem. In 1932, he was commissioned by the Turkish Republic to harmonize and orchestrate the melody created by Zeki √úng√∂r. In 1933, a choir of 160 members performed his Vatan ≈ûarkƒ±sƒ± (National Song) at the Tepeba≈üƒ± Tiyatrosu in Istanbul. The following year, Manas arranged and published 5 T√ºrk Halk ≈ûarkƒ±sƒ± (Five Turkish Folk Songs) and, in 1935, composed Danses populaires Turques (Turkish Folk Dances) for piano, published by Editions Maurice Senard in Paris. Manas was appointed choirmaster of The Choir of Goghtn (‘≥’∏’≤’©’°’∂ ’•÷Ä’£’π’°’≠’∏÷Ç’¥’¢) of the Armenian patriarchal church in Istanbul, where he served for twenty years until 1957. His Rapsodie de l'orient was performed by Istanbul Municipal Orchestra under the baton of Cemal Re≈üit Rey in 1959. Edgar Manas has composed a sizable body of sacred music. The most significant among them is perhaps the Armenian Divine Liturgy for soloists, choir and organ. It was initially conceived in 1912, but was given its final form in 1948. The large scale composition was premiered in Istanbul in 1961 and published in Vienna in 1962. In the forward of the printed score, the composer writes:Edgar Manas (1962). Chants de la liturgie armeni√©nne. Mechitharisten Press, p IV. > Compared to the Latin Mass, which consists of five movements of various > lengths, the Armenian Divine Liturgy is made of several short segments that > are interconnected. In order to avoid any kind of monotony and to conclude > the work with a proper ending, I decided to augment certain numbers...and > finish the composition with a chorale and fugue. This particular Divine > Liturgy with organ obbligato, reserved for special occasions, requires a big > chorus in order to project the necessary volume in loud portions, and create > an even and opaque sonority in soft passages.  Legacy  His students included members of the Ottoman Palace, Turkish musicians, such as H√ºseyin Sadeddin Arel:tr:H√ºseyin Sadeddin Arel and Dr. Suphi Ezgi, and Armenian composers, including Ara Bartevian and Koharik Gazarossian. Edgar Manas is buried in the Pangaltƒ± Catholic Cemetery of ≈ûi≈üli, Istanbul. A large portion of Manas's manuscripts is reposited at the Charents Museum of Literature and Arts of Armenia.

Kosikowski grew up outside of Milwaukee and was a star on his high school football team. He attended Marquette University, but his college football career was derailed by service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, he transferred to Notre Dame, where he played under coach Frank Leahy and won two national championships. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1947, but the Browns acquired him in 1948. He stayed in Cleveland for the 1948 season, when the team won all of its games and the AAFC championship. Early life and college Kosikowski was born in Cudahy, Wisconsinhttps://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/K/KosiFr20.htm and attended Cudahy High School, where he played football as an end. He also boxed for three years and broke the school record in the 220-yard dash. Kosikowski was the captain of the football team and was named to The Milwaukee Journal and The Milwaukee Sentinel all-suburban first teams in 1943. After graduating in 1944, Kosikowski went to Marquette University in Milwaukee and continued his playing career as an end on the Golden Eagles football team. He missed playing time due to injury in the 1944 season, when Marquette won just one game. Kosikowski joined the U.S. Navy the following year as World War II wore on, and was stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes, where Paul Brown was coaching a military football team. He was quickly transferred to a Navy base in California, however, and played for a Fleet City team at Camp Shoemaker that won the service championship in 1945. Kosikowski transferred in 1946 to the University of Notre Dame, which was regrouping under head coach Frank Leahy after losing many of its best players to the war effort. Kosikowski, who was a second-team end, caused a stir that November when he collided with and injured Notre Dame's star quarterback, Johnny Lujack, in practice before a crucial matchup against Army. Lujack played in the game nonetheless, and Notre Dame finished the season with an 8‚Äì0‚Äì1 win-loss-tie record. The team was chosen by the Associated Press as the winner of the college football national championship. Kosikowski stayed at Notre Dame for the 1947 season, when the team went undefeated and again won the national championship. Professional career Kosikowski had been drafted by the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1947, and joined the team in 1948. After playing in one game for the Bills, he was acquired by the Cleveland Browns, an AAFC team coached by Paul Brown. Kosikowski was used as a defensive end by the Browns as the team won all of its games in the 1948 season. The Browns beat the Bills to win that year's championship. Kosikowski was moved in 1949 to the Baltimore Colts as part of an effort to bring more competitive balance to the AAFC, but he decided to quit before the season started.

His 1982 film Interrogation starring Krystyna Janda and Adam Ferency, described as \\"the most anti-Communist film in the history of Polish People's Republic\\" was entered into the 1990 Cannes Film Festival after being suppressed by the Polish communist authorities for several years. Life and career He was born on 27 April 1943 in German-occupied Poland. His father was Edward Bugajski, a member of the pre-war Polish Socialist Party (PPS). He studied philosophy at the University of Warsaw and directing at the National Film School in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which he graduated from in 1973. In 1976, he joined the X Film Unit managed by Andrzej Wajda, where he directed the films A Woman and a Woman and Classes. In 1981, he made the full-length feature film Interrogation, which was banned by the communist censorship because of the film's message being incompatible with the political line of the Polish authorities after the imposition of martial law. As a result of this, the X Unit was officially dissolved. In 1985, Bugajski decided to emigrate to Canada where he became a director of popular television series. The official premiere of Interrogation took place in December 1989, after the collapse of communism in Poland. He was a recipient of numerous film awards including the Golden Grape Award, Special Award at the Gdynia Film Festival and Silver Hugo Award at the Chicago International Film Festival. In June 2008, he was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for \\"his outstanding contributions to the democratic transformations in Poland as well as for achievements for the country in his professional and social work\\".

(2016) Vol. 14, No. 2, p. 270.

While Papunhank eventually converted to Christianity, during his early life he had been regarded as a prophet in Munsee society.Jane T Merrit. At the Crossroads: Indians and Empires on a Mid-Atlantic Frontier,1700-1763. University of Carolina. (2003) p. 84. Up until the 1750s he reportedly struggled with an alcohol problem but following the death of his father, he isolated himself for five days in the woods and was struck by a spiritual vision which had a profound impact on his life.Geoffrey Plank, John Woolman's Path to the Peaceable Kingdom: A Quaker in the British Empire¬∏ University of Pennsylvania Press. (2012) p. 137. He became even further devoted to God, and renounced alcohol and became a pacifist.Jay David, Miller, ‚Äú‚ÄúNature Hath a Voice‚Äù: John Woolman‚Äôs Wilderness Habitus‚Äù, Religion & Literature, Vol. 45, No. 2. (2013) p. 43. Papunhank came to use aspects of both Christianity and traditional Munsee spirituality, and was seen as a medicine man by many of his people.Jane T. Merritt. ‚ÄúDreaming of the Saviors Blood: Moravians and the Great Indian Awakening in Pennsylvania‚Äù, The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol. 54, No. 4. (1997) p. 735. Scholars such as Earl Olmstead have argued that white settlement pressure caused Papunhank, alongside his family and other Munsee people to start a village named Machiwihilusing upon the Susquehanna river.Earl P. Olmstead. Blackcoats Among the Delaware: David Zeisberger on the Ohio Frontier. Kent State University Press. (1991) p. 181. Amongst the village which had a population of some 300 people, almost half became followers of Papunhank, and to European settlers they became known as ‚ÄúQuaker or religious Indians‚Äù, emphasizing the perceived gap between the two cultures.Geoffrey Plank, John Woolman‚Äôs Path, p. 138. His syncretism of Munsee spirituality and Christianity was a source of conflict with some European missionaries, who sought a decreased emphasis on Indigenous traditional world views.A Christian Indian of North America: Or, John Papunhank. A Narrative of Facts. Dublin, (1830) p. 24. Some of these Europeans went so far as to call him a heathen, criticizing his adaptation of Christianity as offensive.A Member of the Brethren‚Äôs Church. The History of the Moravian Mission Among the Indians in North America, From its Commencement to the Present time. With a Preliminary Account of the Indians. T. Allman, (1838) p. 141-142. Papunhank invited some Moravian Christians to visit the village in the year 1756, where concerns were raised over the outbreak of the Seven Years War and general anxieties about the deterioration in Indigenous- settler relations were discussed.Anthony Benezet, Some Observations on the Indian Natives of This Continent, Joseph Crukshank. (1784) p. 23. Papunhank‚Äôs skills as a negotiator and diplomat are worth noting, both for his impact within Indigenous society and in his interactions with colonial officials. He became critical of economic agreements made with colonial governments, and in 1760 refused offers of gifts from Pennsylvania, pointing to the ways in which some of these gift giving agreements had been used to exploit Indigenous communities into disadvantageous treaties.Jane T Merrit, At the Crossroads, p. 84-85. Instead, he adopted an argument that trade relationships should not be based on kinship ties, drawing on his Christian faith to emphasize that economic agreements should be equitable under God, attempting to find new grounds for more advantageous arrangements for his community.Jane T Merrit, At the Crossroads, p. 85-86. Papunhank would again formulate criticisms and questions for Quaker missionaries in 1761, suggesting that although Europeans claimed to adhere to the Bible, they frequently interacted with Indigenous people in a way that clearly disregarded their scripture.Brendan McCaughey, ‚ÄúThe Big Book and the Sword: A Study of Native American Disappointment With White Morality‚Äù, University of New Hampshire Scholars Repository. (2011) p. 22-23. As he argued, the Bible was supposed to direct the way in which Europeans lived their lives, yet they clearly adopted it only when it suited them, while continuing to dictate to Indigenous people how they should live their lives.Brendan McCaughey, p. 23. Michael Goode is one scholar who has argued that Papunhank, in addition to his efforts to support temperance within his community, lobbied for cutting alcohol sales and trading by white settlers, efforts which gained him further attention from Quaker society.Michael Goode, p. 259. Papunhank‚Äôs critique of alcohol and its effect on society had a profound impact, as he became a model of piety and temperance to Quakers, many of whom were involved in the alcohol trade.Michael Goode, p. 266. The location of Machiwihilusing with its proximity to the Pennsylvania settlements, encouraged Papunhank to engage in these diplomatic exchanges, attempting to bridge the gap between the communities by making himself an indispensable ally to the Pennsylvania government.Michael Goode, p. 272. For example, he reached out to the governor in 1763 after the Paxton Boys massacred some Susquehannock Indigenous people, appealing to settlers‚Äô common faith in an attempt to de-escalate the cyclical violence of the period.Jane T Merritt, ‚ÄúDreaming of the Saviors Blood‚Äù, p. 746. His efforts to bring about more peaceful relationships with settlers at times brought him trouble from Indigenous groups, at one point he was attacked and injured with a tomahawk for accosting some Indigenous people who had stolen horses from colonizers.Michael Goode, p. 272. While Papunhank may not have wielded a position of power over all Munsee people, he certainly held enough influence to catch the attention of missionaries, several of whom visited his village. When he preached to a Quaker audience via means of a translator, some in attendance came to believe that he had been blessed with direct communication with God and were struck with his similarities to their religious world views.Geoffrey Plank. ‚ÄúQuaker Reform and Evangelization in the Eighteenth Century‚Äù, American Studies, Vol. 59, No. 2. (2014) p. 181. One Quaker who took the journey to Machiwihilusing was John Woolman, who felt compelled to do so after having met Papunhank earlier in 1761 when he had been in Philadelphia.Jay David Miller. p. 43. To embark on such a journey during a time of increasing violence speaks to his dedication to see Papunhank again, visiting his village despite language and cultural barriers.Jay David Miller, p. 43. He would write fondly of his time spent in the region, describing feelings of mutuality while engaging in a shared feeling of religious experience that contrasted much of the violence that surrounded them.Jay David Miller, p. 47. In 1763, Papunhank was baptised as a Moravian by a prominent missionary and clergyman David Zeisberger, during his visit to the settlement.Thomas Hahn-Bruckart & Rachel Wheeler. ‚ÄúOn an Eighteenth-Century Trail of Tears: The Travel Diary of Johann Jacob Schmick of the Moravian Indian Congregations Journey to the Susquehanna, 1765‚Äù, Journal of Moravian History, Vol. 15, No. 1.

He adopted the name Johannes, and in the context of heightened colonial violence infringing upon their village he petitioned officials in Philadelphia to start a new settlement with Moravian support.Thomas Hahn-Bruckart & Rachel Wheeler, p. 52-54. This settlement began in 1765 and came to be known as Friedenshutten, which was composed of mostly Munsee and Mohicans with a limited number of Moravian settlers.Thomas Hahn- Bruckart & Rachel Wheeler, p. 53-54. This community was short-lived and was displaced by 1768 following an influx of white British colonizers.Thomas Hahn- Bruckart & Rachel Wheeler, p. 55.

It was produced in 1940 by Max W. Kimmich and starred Olga Tschechowa, Karl Ludwig Diehl, Ferdinand Marian and others. The screenplay was written by Wolf Neumeister and Hans Bertram after a novel of the same title by Nicola Rhon (Maria von Kirchbach) that had been published at Ullstein publishing house in 1937. It was made at the Johannisthal Studios in Berlin, with sets designed by the art directors Wilhelm Depenau and Otto Erdmann. The shoot lasted from December 1939 to February 1940. It passed censorship on 22 April 1940 and had its debut in Berlin's Ufa-Palast am Zoo two days later.  Synopsis  The film takes place in the fictional Irish county of Glenarvon, somewhere in the northwest of Galway, and tells the story of Gloria Grandison, the Irish wife of the local British magistrate, who falls in love with an Irish freedom fighter and leaves her husband for him. The story is set in 1884, during the Irish fight for freedom and independence from the United Kingdom.

In this film as in My life for Ireland, the British are brutal and unscrupulous oppressors.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p. 97 It does not, however, operate on such crude anti-British stereotypes as such later films as Ohm Kr√ºger and Carl Peters, which were filmed after Hitler gave up hope of making peace with Britain.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p. 99 The fight against the British, furthermore, is depicted less historically and more in the manner of the Nazi seizure of power, including the disruption of a funeral as in the film Hans Westmar.Robert Edwin Hertzstein, The War That Hitler Won pp. 343-4  Awards  Shortly after release, the film was graded artistically valuable by film checkers of the Propaganda Ministry. This attribute was given to movies that fulfilled special aesthetic criteria besides the actors' performances and meant that cinemas had to pay less entertainment tax when showing this film. Even Goebbels was quite enthusiastic about the final movie: on 22 April 1940, he wrote in his diary: \\"Now it's great and very useful for our propaganda.\\"  Further information  The film was shown in many foreign countries, especially those that were allied with Nazi Germany, such as Finland, where it made its debut on 8 March 1942 under the title of Rakkaus voittaa kaikken. Later it was renamed there to Vapauden liekki, and in 1941, it was banned from the stages.

Current programmes are available for 30 days after transmission on the main STV channel, with archive programming available longer-term. The service was established to hold full programming and \\"long-form\\" content, separate from the existing STV Video site, which would then be rebuilt to hold \\"short-form\\" content, news, weather and clips. Most STV primetime, and some daytime, shows are available on the website; however, some sports, movies, imported programming and network programmes with copyright issues are not. Programming The STV Player is intended to combine network programming shown by STV, such as Emmerdale, Coronation Street and The Jeremy Kyle Show, plus regional programming, such as Made in Scotland, Scotland Tonight and STV Rugby, and archive STV programming, like The Steamie, Take The High Road and High Times, in a separate site from other, \\"short-form\\" videos. In general, programmes are available in their entirety, but in some cases, STV does not have the right to broadcast all the content online; in these instances, the segments of the show which are not subject to these rights issues are loaded onto STV Player, with the un-cleared segments excluded. In November 2018, as part of an advertising-sales partnership with STV, Eleven Sports sub-licensed selected La Liga and Serie A matches for streaming within Scotland.  Capacity issues  In April 2014, STV Player experienced downtime during its broadcast of Salmond & Darling: The Debate‚Äîthe first televised debate for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. STV had secured exclusive rights to the broadcast, and refused to offer it to any other broadcaster (including the BBC and Sky News), while STV's network ITV did not choose to pick up the live airing of the debate across the rest of the UK (excluding the ITV Border region), leading to higher-than-anticipated demand for the internet stream. STV apologized for the capacity problems, while BBC Parliament aired the full debate broadcast the next day.  Supported platforms  The website uses Brightcove Flash technology, similar to those used by the services provided by the BBC and Channel 4.

Ankara station is also a hub for YHT high-speed trains, with its own exclusive platforms and concourse. TCDD Ta≈üƒ±macƒ±lƒ±k also operates intercity train service to Kars, Tatvan and Kurtalan as well as Ba≈ükentray commuter rail service. Located within the historic Ulus quarter, the station is a landmark of the city. In 2016, a new building was opened above the YHT platforms known as Ankara Tren Garƒ± (ATG). The ATG building serves as a hub for high-speed rail with its own concourse containing information and tickets booths, waiting rooms and a VIP lounge, and is connected to the rest of the station via a skybridge. History =Ottoman Empire period (1892‚Äì1922)= The original builder, the Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie (CFOA), was engaged in shipping war materials to the fronts in Palestine and Mesopotamia during World War I. Therefore, between 1914 and 1918 the Ankara station had no passenger service and very little freight service. The CFOA fell under British military control after the war, but the Turkish Nationalists captured Ankara and parts of the CFOA. During the Turkish Independence War, CFOA transported troops from Ankara, as the newly named capital of Turkey, to the front near Eski≈üehir.CFOA History - Trains of Turkey CFOA History =Turkish Republic period (1922‚Äìpresent)= View of 19 May Square and the Ankara Railway Station taken in the 1940s After the Turkish independence war ended, the passenger train services from Istanbul to Ankara resumed. The CFOA, now under Turkish control, finally opened the line to Kayseri and Ankara was no longer the terminus. CFOA was then acquired by the Turkish State Railways (TCDD) on June 1, 1927, and Ankara station was placed under TCDD control.TCDD History -Trains of Turkey TCDD History In 1927 the Anatolian Express was inaugurated as a premier overnight train from Istanbul to Ankara operated by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL).The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Steam & Rail - By Colin Garratt and Max Wade- Matthews, page 397 The current Art deco building was built in 1937 by German architects. As TCDD completed rail lines to other cities, new train services from Ankara such as the 9th of September Express (1939) to Izmir, the Eastern Express (1939) to Kars, and the Southern Express (1944) to Diyarbakƒ±r and Kurtalan made Ankara station one of the busiest stations in Turkey. In 1972, the station, along with the track between Sincan and Kaya≈ü, were electrified with 25 kV AC catenary for the Ankara Suburban Railway. In 1993 the Istanbul- Ankara line was fully electrified. In the 1990s TCDD opened a steam museum next to the station. In 2009 a high-speed train service operated from Ankara to Eski≈üehir. The 2015 Ankara bombings occurred on 10 October 2015 at 10:04 local time (EEST) in Ankara.

MiHR contributes to the sustainability of the Canadian mining sector by collaborating with its stakeholders and communities of interest, to develop solutions tailored to human resources needs in the mining sector.http://www.mihr.ca/en/about/index.asp Its vision is to build a diverse, sustainable, safe and skilled Canadian Mining workforce that is recognized globally. Background In 1994, the Canadian Federal Government's Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI) recommended the establishment of a mining industry council to address sector-wide human resources issues. In response to the WMI's request, the Mining Industry Training and Adjustment Council (MITAC) was established in November 1996, through the combined efforts of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) and three major unions in the mining sector: The United Steelworkers of America, the Communication, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and the Canadian Autoworkers Union. MITAC's goal was to enable Canadian mining companies, unions and employees to collaborate to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and availability of training, and to maximize the skills, adaptability and employability of the workers in the minerals and metals sector. Its activities were funded by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). After the HRSDC halted funding MITAC's training development initiatives and Youth Opportunities Program in early 2002, they commissioned the council to undertake a sector study, titled \\"Prospecting the Future - Meeting Human Resources Challenges in the Canadian Minerals and Metals Industry\\". Its 2005 release highlighted the ongoing need for MITAC's expertise in addressing HR challenges facing the mining industry. In particular, the study noted that the industry had to make better use of all potential sources of employment, including youth, women, Indigenous people and new Canadians. It also highlighted the need to ensure a skilled workforce. With the study's findings, MITAC undertook a strategic planning process resulting in a new mandate and future direction and function. Effective February 2006, The Mining Industry Training and Adjustment Council (MITAC) was renamed the Mining Industry Human Resources Council (MiHR).  Services  MiHR conducts research into Canada's mining labour market with the objective of uncovering the important HR trends relevant to the industry. This research forms the cornerstone of the programs MiHR undertakes to identify opportunities and address the human resource and labour market challenges within the Canadian minerals and metals sector. They also offer custom research reports for those interested in topics not covered by their standard reports. To help fill openings and generate new jobs for the Canadian minerals and metals mining industry, MiHR runs a variety of programs such as its Gearing Up and Green Jobs wage subsidy programs, an online Mining Career Quiz, and provides information on its website.  Programs and Initiatives  = Gearing Up = Announced in April 2018, Gearing Up is a work-integrated learning (WIL) program for Canada's mining sector. It aims to create 850 new WIL opportunities in mining over four years. Wage subsidies up to $7,000 are available to employers who create new WIL opportunities, such as co ops, internships, field placements, applied projects, capstone projects or case competitions. MiHR works with a national consortium of mining employers, industry associations and post-secondary institutions to implement program activities and inform how industry and education can work together collaboratively to develop WIL opportunities. = The Green Jobs Program = MiHR's Green Jobs wage subsidy program aims to strengthen the mining industry labour market by helping post-secondary graduates gain relevant and meaningful work experience in mining through paid internships. Its objective is to provide 120 meaningful internship opportunities in the mining sector related to science, technology, engineering and math. Jobs with a focus on clean technology and innovation that provide an environmental benefit to Canada are eligible for a wage subsidy of up to $12,000. = Gender Equity in Mining (GEM) Works = GEM Works is a 12-month, comprehensive training program that builds networks of 10 like-minded mining companies or sites who collaborate to learn from one another, share successes and challenges, and offer mutual support to remove unintentional barriers to gender inclusion. It aims to help companies foster a mining and minerals industry where both women and men have the best opportunities for making great contributions and rewarding careers. = The Canadian Mining Certification Program (CMCP) = The CMCP intends to measure and certify expertise in mining, validating the skills, knowledge, and experience of workers in the mining sector. CMCP is the first - and only - national mining worker certification program in Canada. CMCP recognizes individual mine workers who have demonstrated their competency and expertise by meeting the National Occupational Standards (NOS) established for the Canadian mining industry. They establish clear, objective skill and knowledge benchmarks, and form the basis for workplace development, driving curriculum development within educational institutes, and the alignment of company training programs. = Mining Essentials = Mining Essentials is a pre- employment training program for Indigenous peoples who are interested in exploring career options in mining. The program teaches both the essential skills and work readiness skills that the Canadian mining industry has deemed necessary to gain an entry-level position. It is being expanded as part of the National Essential and Work Readiness (NEWR) Skills Training Program for the mining industry to better represent youth, women and immigrants. = ENSEMBLE = ENSEMBLE, subtitled The Mining Industry Diversity Network, is an online meeting place that provides Human Resources, diversity and recruiting professionals from Canada's mining industry a space to connect with diversity- focused associations, Indigenous mining and community experts, and immigrant employment counselors to find ways to promote diversity and inclusion in mining. MiHR uses this platform to host monthly webinars based on a variety of diversity-based topics. = Immigrant Outreach = The Mining Specific Professional Immigrant Networks (M-PIN) project is the key arm of MiHR's immigrant outreach programs. In collaboration with the Toronto Region Immigrant Council (TRIEC) and Professions North/Nord in Sudbury, M-PIN aims to adapt, test and evaluate innovative methods to broaden engagement to better recruit and integrate immigrant talent into the Ontario mining industry.

It would not be in China‚Äôs financial interest, he argued, to destabilize the dollar by recalling the country‚Äôs vast loans to the U.S. Doing so would result in a shrunken export market for China. Hormats calls this MAD‚Äîmutually assured depression. In 2004, the government fined Goldman Sachs $2 million for illegally and selectively promoting the stock of four Asian companies that were about to go public. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hormats and others \\"made illegal offerings of securities to select customers in 1999 and 2000 and made inappropriate statements to the press.\\" Hormats told four media outlets that PetroChina, a Chinese-based oil producer, was not invested in Darfur.

McGuinness started his club career with Sarsfield's in his native Derry City. He later played for Sean O'Leary's Newbridge winning Derry Senior Football Championship medals with the club. McGuinness finished his club career at Steelstown. He usually played in midfield. He was shorter than most midfielders, but made up for this with his excellent spring and catching abilities, which drew McGuinness comparisons with Jim McKeever. Along with his ability to out-jump bigger opponents was his capability to score long-range points and his free-running play was described as a \\"nightmare for defenders\\". McGuinness is known as one of Derry's best ever players. Along with Mickey McNaught, he has been described as one of the two best ever players to come from Derry City. Personal life McGuinness was born in Derry City on 15 May 1949, to Peggy and William McGuinness, and grew up just 50 yards from Celtic Park. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School in the city.

Founded in the 11th century as a chapel of ease to St Nicolas' Church in the Saxon riverside village of Old Shoreham, it was in use for several centuries until depopulation caused Old Erringham to become unviable as a settlement. The chapel fell into ruin, and its remains have been incorporated into a barn on the farm which now occupies the site of the village. English Heritage has listed the remaining structure at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History The east bank of the River Adur‚Äîthe area covered by the present-day town of Shoreham-by-Sea and its rural hinterland‚Äîwas first settled during the Iron Age, and also saw Roman activity. During the Saxon era it became a prosperous agricultural area. Two villages developed next to the river: Old Shoreham, about north of the English Channel and the river estuary, and Old Erringham, another mile to the north. Old Shoreham became important enough to support a large church‚ÄîSt Nicolas' Church‚Äîby about 900, and its population at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 was 76. Erringham is believed to have been founded as an exclusively agricultural settlement by a Saxon named Erra, who may have had a homestead there (archaeological evidence discovered in 1964 supports this; the remains of a Saxon hut were found). Seven people were recorded as living in Erringham in 1086. A chapel of ease was built to serve the settlement in the 11th century. It was never parished, and was always administered from St Nicolas' Church. The flint and stone structure had a chancel and a nave. Some structural work may have been carried out in the 12th and 13th centuries as well, as Erringham briefly grew more important: by the 13th century it had a manor house and windmill, and its population was nearly the same as that of Old Shoreham. William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber held the chapel and its mother church at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086; soon afterwards he or his son Philip founded the new town of New Shoreham at the river estuary and built a third church, dedicated to St Mary de Haura, there. The chapel continued in service for about 300 years, but the rapid decline of Old Erringham village led to its abandonment. Because the village was thriving in the 13th century and was reliant on agriculture, its depopulation has been explained by a combination of the Black Death of the mid-14th century, changes in farming methods, and alterations in the flow of the nearby River Adur (which affected how the land could be farmed). By the 16th century, only one farm survived. The chapel fell into disrepair: the nave disappeared (although its foundations can still be seen) and only the chancel was left standing. This was converted into a barn on the farm. The structure is still known as, and marked on maps as, \\"The Chapel\\". The east wall retains a stone-mullioned two-light window of the \\"Transitional\\" style between Norman and English Gothic architecture (a style also employed in the substantial parish church of New Shoreham, St Mary de Haura Church, in the late 12th century). The north and south walls each have one small Norman-era lancet window. The entrance door is in the west wall. Modern additions include an iron roof and a concrete floor. Erringham chapel was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 8 May 1950. Such buildings are defined as being \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 106 Grade II listed buildings, and 119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district.

Nashville, Tennessee, 1941 Peter Sekaer (born Peter Ingemann Sekj√¶r 1901 ‚Äì 14 July 1950) was a Danish-American photographer and artist. Biography Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, Sekaer came to New York in 1918 to seek freedom and opportunity. By 1922 he had a reputation as a master sign painter and had his own successful business producing posters. Several years later he began to take classes at The Art Student's League. Sekaer soon became acquainted with Ben Shahn, who may have been the one to introduce him to photography and who later introduced him to Walker Evans. After 1933, he devoted himself exclusively to photography, studying with Berenice Abbott at the New School for Social Research, and assisting Walker Evans on the project of photographing The Museum of Modern Art's African sculpture collection. In 1936 Sekaer accompanied Evans, who was hired by the Resettlement Administration (RA, later to become the FSA) on a photographic journey throughout the South, often shooting the same subject. Like many of his contemporaries, Sekaer sought to capture the real world with photographs that combined artistic expression with a personal commitment to social change. From 1936 to 1942 Sekaer became a professional photographer and was hired by the federal government agency, the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), and later became the head of the REA's graphic department. In 1938 the REA sent Sekaer to the United States Housing Authority (USHA). The photographs Sekaer made for the USHA, an agency primarily concerned with the removal of city slums and sponsorship of public urban housing, reveal his continued interest in the richness of human experience and environment. Transferred again in 1940 Sekaer photographed Navajo and Pueblo Indians for the Office of Indian Affairs. That same year, he worked as photographic researcher and still photographer for the REA film Power and the Land. After 1942 he continued working for other federal agencies photographing briefly for the Office of War Information (OWI), and the American Red Cross-agencies whose agendas conflicted with his own, and limited his freedom in artistic expression. Continually frustrated by this, Sekaer left Washington, DC for New York where he freelanced for several years, doing fashion and editorial assignments, until he died of a heart attack at the age of 49 in 1950. Work Although Sekaer's photographs were widely published and exhibited during his lifetime, his work largely became forgotten after his death until an exhibition held in 1980 at the Witkin Gallery in New York and later in 1990 at the Royal Library in Copenhagen for which a catalogue was published. Many of Sekaer's photographic prints can be seen in the public collection of the Royal Library in Copenhagen. The High Museum of Art in Atlanta acquired a trove of more than seventy rare vintage prints by Sekaer, the largest holding of its kind in any American art museum. Many of these works have never been on public view. From June 2010 until January 2011, the museum staged an exhibition of Sekaer's work titled \\"Signs of Life.\\" High Museum show moves Peter Sekaer toward photography canon (High Museum of Art Atlanta) 12 July 2010 References  Publications  Annemette S√∏rensen: Peter Sekaer, 1990, , hft, Museum Tusculanum ( Danish) External links * \\"Finding Other America in Slums and on Farms,\\" EVE M.

The main oppositional movement, Solidarity, was delegalized, and its key members were interned. However, by April 1982, Solidarity re-emerged, creating its underground body, the Temporary Coordinating Committee (known as TKK from the Polish name Tymczasowa Komisja Koordynacyjna),Polish Americans By Helena Znaniecka Lopata, Mary Patrice Erdmans, page 223.

At the beginning, the Committee opposed street demonstrations, drawing the so-called \\"Five times yes\\" appeal, which stipulated negotiations with the government and release of all political prisoners. However, when the program was rejected, the Committee changed its stance, announcing the \\"Five times no\\" appeal, and urging the nation to participate in demonstrations on August 31, 1982, the second anniversary of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement.Solidarity in underground ‚Äì portal 13grudnia81.pl, supported by the Institute of National Remembrance The August 31 street protests were organized by all regional underground structures of Solidarity. In Lower Silesia, the main oppositional bodies were Regional Strike Committee, and Fighting Solidarity. In Legnica Voivodeship, there also were such organizations, as Interfactory Strike Committee, and Interfactory Coordinating Committee. The demonstrations were regarded as very important for the future of the opposition movements, as activists hoped that they would become a turning point, forcing the government to change its policy. The government was aware of these plans, and initiated a massive propaganda campaign, aimed at reducing the number of demonstrators. Special posters were printed and distributed, and on August 25, general Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak spoke on TV, warning against \\"possible tragic consequences\\". His threats were barely concealed: \\"If the provocateurs have not had enough of their lessons, we will provide them with some more\\". In factories across the nation, party activists warned the workers, telling them not to demonstrate. However, the most important part of the action was carried out by the security services. In the last days of August, its agents detained hundreds of people, and confiscated several underground printing shops. On August 28, during a teleconference, general Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak told police commanders of the voivodeships: \\"The victory must be ours. We have to use a tough rule of action: be quick and determined\\". Members of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party sometimes used an exaggerated tone, while describing the plans of Solidarity. On August 26, during a meeting with party activists in Szczecin, said: \\"The plans of the extremists are the following: public gatherings, a general strike, and, if necessary, an uprising aimed at overthrowing the social system. I accuse Solidarity leaders of political stupidity, leading to crimes against the state and the nation\\". On August 27, Zbigniew Bujak, one of the Solidarity leaders who had eluded arrest, published a statement, in which he urged the nation to participate in rallies and demonstrations on the second anniversary of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement. Two days later, general Jaruzelski warned people to keep away from protests. On the next day, units of riot police armed with water cannons were deployed on the streets of Warsaw and other main cities of the country. Citizens were warned that the government would not hesitate to use force. Polish news agency PAP issued a statement, which said: \\"The martial law decree makes the forces of law and order absolutely responsible for ensuring public order. In order to fulfill this duty, the agencies of law and order may use means of direct compulsion and in special cases they can be aided by units of the armed forces\\".  Street protests across the country  On August 31, 1982, demonstrations took place in 66 Polish towns and cities, with as many as 18 of them occurring in southwestern province of Lower Silesia. Official reports stated that protests took place in 65 places. In Wroc≈Çaw, which was one of main centers of underground Solidarity, several thousand people for many hours fought riot police and soldiers. One demonstrator, 27-year-old Kazimierz Micha≈Çczyk, was killed by a bullet. Street fights were a common sight not only in major urban centers, such as Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Szczecin, Wroc≈Çaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and Gda≈Ñsk, but also in provincial cities (Rzesz√≥w, Koszalin, Kielce, Przemy≈õl, Czƒôstochowa, Bielsko-Bia≈Ça, Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski), and towns (Starachowice, Lubin, Konin). The magnitude of the demonstrations was confirmed by official sources, as on September 1, PAP informed that a day before, the police detained 4,050 people nationwide (589 in Warsaw, 645 in Wroc≈Çaw, 201 in Szczecin, and 120 in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski). Among those arrested was Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity activist and physicist of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

The rally in the local Freedom Square began on August 31, at 3 pm A cross made of flowers was laid, and a small banner was raised. People sung the Polish national anthem, and than chanted: \\"down with the junta\\", \\"release those interned\\", \\"Jaruzelski is a traitor and murderer of the nation\\", \\"down with communism\\", \\"free Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa\\" etc. About 30 minutes later, the crowd of 2,000 was surrounded by 80-member unit of the riot police. In response, agitated protesters shouted: \\"pigs\\", \\"bandits\\", \\"Gestapo\\", \\"servants of Brezhnev\\". People unsuccessfully tried to erect a barricade. They were attacked and dispersed with tear gas. At 4 pm, a platoon of riot police (ZOMO) from Legnica appeared on Lubin streets and immediately attacked the protesters. The officers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, which they pointed towards the demonstrators. When the line of policemen reached the intersection of Kopernika and Odrodzenia streets, some of them opened fire. A few minutes later, two men, 26-year-old Mieczys≈Çaw Po≈∫niak and 32-year-old Andrzej Trajkowski, were mortally wounded. The events of the late afternoon and evening hours are difficult to recount. It has been established that the police opened fire several times more, thus hitting 28-year-old Micha≈Ç Adamowicz in the back of his head. He died on September 5. Before 5 pm, another ZOMO platoon came to Lubin (its members were armed with semi-automatic pistols P-83 Wanads), and local police commandant asked offices in Leszno and Zielona G√≥ra to send more reinforcements. At about 5:30, the police changed their tactics. Instead of attacking large groups of demonstrators, the officers created the so-called raid groups, consisting of 6‚Äì7 officers, riding in Nysa vans. They roamed the town, brutally attacking even single persons. Meanwhile, the demonstrators, upon finding out about deaths of their two colleagues, became more determined. More people joined the fighting, and riots lasted until 10:30 pm, when another ZOMO company from Zielona G√≥ra, a platoon of soldiers from Krosno Odrza≈Ñskie, and three water cannons were brought to Lubin. Altogether, 1323 officers pacified the demonstration, and new street fights erupted in the town both on September 2 and 3. Altogether, on August 31 in Lubin, three demonstrators were killed, unknown number wounded (six of them were hit by bullets). Around 300 people were arrested. Immediately after pacification of the town, security forces began destruction of evidence.

It was designed and built by Elias Holl, Stadtbaumeister (Master Builder of the town), in 1615‚Äì1624. Due to its historic and cultural importance, it is protected by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Summary On 25 August 1615, the foundation stone of the building was laid by then Stadtbaumeister Elias Holl. The exterior of the building was completed in March 1620, and the interior in 1624. Technologically, the Augsburger Rathaus was a pioneering performance; upon its completion it was the first building in the world with more than six storeys. The rigid elegance of the large stonework was similar to Florence, the cultural and financial capital of Northern Italy, with which the city gladly compared itself. The self-image of the Free Imperial City of Augsburg is represented by two conspicuous ornaments on the large gable at the front of the building: the first is the Reichsadler, or Imperial Eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, representing the town's importance; the second is the large copper pine cone, or Zirbelnuss, which is the symbol of Augsburg. The view of the Rathaus was almost completely blocked by the stock exchange building built in 1828, until British bombing on the night of 25 February 1944 destroyed the latter. The removal of the remains of the stock exchange in the 1960s finally made it possible to view the Rathaus properly from the town square. History Augsburg Rathaus, c. 1818. View from the Dorint Hotel Tower The original Augsburger Rathaus was built in 1385, and it was decided at the beginning of the seventeenth century to complete a simple renovation of it in order to accommodate the Imperial Reichstag, which then sat in the city. In 1609, the town council commissioned the renowned architect, Elias Holl, to draw up a renovation plan for the Gothic building. It was only after six years of work that Holl could produce a plan for the magistrates, but it was rejected by the council, and, to Holl's surprise, he was issued with a new brief, on the initiative of mayor Hieronymus Imhoff (1575‚Äì1638): to demolish the old Gothic town hall and erect in its place a beautiful new building. Elias Holl produced his plan for the new Augsburger Rathaus, which was to be built in the Renaissance style, and, on 25 August 1615, the foundation stone was laid. It was the will of the magistrates that the Rathaus should not have a tower, however Elias Holl insisted on the famous onion domes by the gable, and in 1618 was allowed to proceed. The exterior of the Rathaus was completed in 1620, and the interior in 1624, following an almost fifteen-year planning phase and nine years of building. Inside the Rathaus, Holl built three overlaying halls: on the ground floor, behind the main entrance, is the Lower Fletz, and on the floor above, the Upper Fletz; by far the most impressive room in the building, however, is the double-height Goldener Saal, or Golden Hall, with its magnificent doorways, murals and coffered ceiling. Adjacent to the Goldener Saal are the F√ºrstenzimmer, or Prince's Rooms, designed as retreats for important guests. The construction cost of the new Rathaus was around 100,000 Guilder. The Rathaus, as it stands by the Perlachturm The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), which spread across Europe shortly after the beginning of work on the Rathaus, also took its toll on Augsburg. One of the major economic centres of the continent before the war, it emerged in the middle of the seventeenth century in decline. The war had cost Augsburg not only its centuries-old economic supremacy in Europe, but also more than half of its population. The Reichstag, for which the splendid Rathaus was originally built, now took place in other German cities. Only once more, in the late 17th Century, was the Rathaus the scene of a celebration of nationwide importance, when Joseph I held a banquet in the Golden Hall in 1690, on his coronation as King of the Romans. During the devastating British bombing of Augsburg in World War II, the Rathaus was hit a number of times by high-explosive and incendiary bombs, completely burning the exterior of the building. The Rathaus was rebuilt after the war, the exterior according to its historic appearance but the interior much simplified, and from 1955 was again used as the administrative centre of the city. Between 1980 and 1984, the fa√ßade of the building was restored to its original colours, according to historical records. Inside the Renaissance building, what had been damaged in the Golden Hall during the war was restored to its original splendour, and on 9 January 1985, the Rathaus was reopened as part of the city's two-thousandth anniversary celebrations. Rooms =Lower Fletz= The visitor enters the Augsburger Rathaus through an inconspicuous door at the front of the building, through a vestibule and into the Lower Fletz, on the ground floor. This monumental hall, with its marble columns and vaulted ceiling, is the main entrance to one of two staircases leading to the upper floors of the Rathaus. =Upper Fletz= The Upper Fletz, on the second floor, once housed the offices of the Augsburg town council, but since the war has been used as the meeting room of the council. The second floor also has offices of the political groups represented on the council. This part of the Rathaus is not generally open to visitors. =Golden Hall= The Goldener Saal The Goldener Saal, or Golden Hall, is the most impressive of the Rathaus's rooms, and one of the most important cultural monuments of the late German Renaissance. The Hall covers an area of with a ceiling height of , and is richly adorned with large doorways, magnificent murals and a coffered ceiling. The interior of the Hall was designed by Johann Matthias Kager, and was not completed until 1643 (the rest of the building was completed in 1624). The numerous ceiling paintings and murals were executed according to a concept of the Jesuit Matth√§us Raders (1561 - 1634) and designs by the Flemish artist Peter Candid (1584-1628).Rathaus mit goldenem Saal at Mozartstadt The Hall was badly damaged by bombing during the war. When the Rathaus was restored after the war, the Goldener Saal was not repaired to its original state, but left with a wooden ceiling, small doors and white plastered walls. It was used until the 1980s as an exhibition space. In the early 1980s, the council decided to renovate the Goldener Saal for the upcoming 2000th anniversary of the city in 1985. The room was redecorated according to historical drawings and photographs, starting with the basic reconstruction of the coffered ceiling, together with the painted ceilings, the floor and the doors. On 9 January 1985, the Hall was re-opened close to its former glory. Supported by numerous donations and the active interest of Augsburg, the murals and extensive gold jewellery that had once decorated the Hall were reinstated over subsequent years, and the hall was reopened a second time in 1996. The master carpenter Wolfgang Ebner, who created this wonderful ceiling =F√ºrstenzimmer= The F√ºrstenzimmer, or Prince's Rooms, are four in number and located around the edges of the Golden Hall. They were originally used as retreats for distinguished guests of the council. Each room is around with coffered ceiling, panelled walls and parquet floors, and containing elaborately carved writing desks, tables, chairs and stools and several lamps. These rooms were also badly damaged during the war, and only one has yet been fully restored. Work is continuing on the others. Today The Augsburger Rathaus now houses permanent exhibits on the history of the former imperial city and its partner cities, as well as frequently changing exhibitions on different historical and current political issues.. These are held in the Lower Fletz and are open to any visitor. The Goldener Saal is a popular venue for receptions, concerts and ceremonies. The Lower Fletz and Goldener Saal are open daily, although there is an entrance charge to the Goldener Saal. The basement of the Rathaus houses a Rathskeller.

Wetherby is situated at the approximate centre of the triangle. Harrogate is situated to the far north of the triangle. The Golden Triangle is a term commonly used by estate agents for the area of West and North Yorkshire lying between Harrogate, York and North Leeds. The areas of the Golden Triangle are all part of the Leeds City Region. Lying in the centre of this area is Wetherby on the fringes of West Yorkshire. Despite mainly being an affluent area the area does consist of some deprived areas such as Swarcliffe, Cranmer Bank and Hallfields. The most expensive street in the golden triangle is Fulwith Mill Lane on the South Side of Harrogate, where the average house price is ¬£1.7 million. Boundaries The exact boundaries are disputed, in particular around north Leeds, but the Outer Ring Road is often quoted as the boundary so that the area includes Whinmoor, Swarcliffe, Cross Gates and Garforth but not Seacroft, this definition is supported by Leeds City Council. Affluent areas such as Roundhay and Gledhow lie within the confines of the ring road, but are usually included in the area. To the north, the town of Knaresborough would also lie within the boundaries of the golden triangle. Usage The term is mostly applied by estate agents, however, it has been used by local councils within this area and also by the local media. Publications such as the Yorkshire Evening Post, the Wetherby News and the Harrogate Advertiser have used the term on many occasions. Demography While there have been no studies into the demography of the area as a whole. Census studies in the areas within the 'triangle', show most parts of the area have a predominantly white demographic. This remains constant irrespective of the social demographic. The social demographic does however vary throughout the area. Swarcliffe for with a population of 6,751, of which 4,544 were considered to be \\"hard-pressed\\", or experiencing financial difficulty. Conversely Linton compromises almost exclusively wealthy professional residents. Housing Early-19th-century semis in Boston Spa. York lies to the east Pockets of urban decay exist within the triangle such as these flats (now demolished) in Swarcliffe. With the exception of certain small pockets of the area, house prices have traditionally been high in the area, the price hikes in the area often being attributed to the economic growth in the commercial centre of Leeds. As a result, there has often been great demand to build housing in this area. In 2006, Leeds City Council, York City Council and Harrogate Borough Council established a programme aiming to help people afford property in the area. While house prices grew in the area during the prosperous years of economic boom, they fell in line with the rest of the country during the recession of 2008 and 2009. The types of housing in this area vary greatly. Land scarcity and high demand have meant new developments are often of a dense nature. Recently, new proposals have been put forward to build on former green belt in this area. The building of housing on the 'Church Fields' site in Boston Spa began in 2012, and plans have also been put forward to build on fields in the Spofforth Hill area of Wetherby. For many years there has been debate about expanding the Leeds urban boundaries north along the A58 corridor towards Wetherby by building on fields around Whinmoor, Swarcliffe and Shadwell. Economy Much of the area is commuter belt for the commercial centre of Leeds which functions as a large financial and commercial centre. There are however other buoyant industries within this area such as tourism (mainly in York, but to an extent also in Leeds and Harrogate), manufacturing (which is prevalent to the east of Leeds as well as in Wetherby and Thorp Arch) and agriculture, which exists in various areas around the 'triangle'. =Tourism= Besides the city centres of York and Leeds as well as the town of Harrogate, there are attractions in the area which bring visitors to the area such as Roundhay Park, RHS Garden Harlow Carr, The Market Town of Knaresborough and racecourses in York and Wetherby. Leeds and Harrogate also gain visitors due to their proximity to the Yorkshire Dales national park, while York does due to its proximity to the North York Moors national park. Within the golden triangle itself, Almscliffe Crag has proved popular with hikers. Transport The area has many road and rail transport links. The A1(M) runs through the area, while the M1 terminates in this area, merging with the A1(M). Both York and Leeds have mainline railway stations and are linked themselves by a direct line via Cross Gates and also a commuter line via Headingley, Horsforth, Knaresborough and Harrogate. Many areas in the 'triangle' however are without rail links such as Roundhay, Gledhow, Shadwell and Wetherby. Leeds Bradford International Airport lies just to the west of the area. Politics The area does not contain any particularly safe seats for any political party. North Leeds and central York generally return Labour MPs while Harrogate has in the past delivered both Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs and Wetherby has elected both Labour and Conservative MPs in the recent past. Leeds City Council has been led by the three main parties in its history, control of York has alternated between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party and Harrogate is a Conservative-Liberal Democrat battleground.

Education Vaughan graduated from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering chemistry in 1923. While at Georgia Tech, Vaughan was a member of Phi Kappa Phi and Pi Delta Epsilon; a contributor to The Technique in 1918 and 1919; Assistant Editor (1922) and Editor-in-Chief (1923) of the Blue Print; Captain, R.O.T.C; and President, Emerson Chemical Society. Vaughan subsequently earned a Master of Science in ceramic engineering from the University of Illinois in 1925. Career First EES (later known as GTRI) director, W. Harry Vaughan (left), visiting GTRI Director Don Grace in 1984. Vaughan returned to Georgia Tech and became an assistant professor of ceramic engineering, the second faculty member in that department (the first bring Professor Arthur V. Henry). The Ceramic Engineering Department is a distant predecessor to Georgia Tech's modern School of Materials Science and Engineering in the Georgia Tech College of Engineering. In Spring 1935, Vaughan was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa. =Establishment of GTRI= In 1929, some Georgia Tech faculty members belonging to Sigma Xi started a Research Club at Tech that met once a month. One of the monthly subjects, proposed by Vaughan, was a collection of issues related to Tech, such as library development, and the development of a state engineering station. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiments at universities around the country, and the report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929. Their report noted that several similar organizations had been opened across the country at other engineering schools and were successful in local economic development. In 1933, S. V. Sanford, president of the University of Georgia, proposed that a \\"technical research activity\\" be established at Tech in order to boost the state's struggling economy in the midst of the Great Depression. President Marion L. Brittain and Dean William Vernon Skiles asked for and examined the Research Club's 1929 report, and moved to create such an organization. $5,000 in funds (equivalent to $ in ) were allocated directly from the Georgia Board of Regents and the station started operation on July 1, 1934. =Director of GTRI= Vaughan was selected as the acting director of the Engineering Experiment Station in April 1934, and hired 13 part-time faculty and a few graduate assistants. Vaughan was instrumental in securing GTRI's first permanent building, known then as the Research Building but later expanded and renamed the Thomas Hinman Research Building. Also in 1939, Vaughan became the director of the School of Ceramic Engineering, which raised his salary to $4,200 (equivalent to $ in ). He was the director of the station until 1940, when he accepted a higher- paying job as head of the Regional Products Research Division of the Tennessee Valley Authority and was replaced at EES by Harold Bunger (the first chairman of Georgia Tech's chemical engineering department). The ceramics department was subsequently (but temporarily) discontinued due to World War II, and all of the current students found wartime employment. The department would be reincarnated after the war under the guidance of Lane Mitchell.

It has around 35,000 members, and its terrain comprises 170,000 m¬≤ in the well regarded quarter of Jardim Europa. The club's assets are valued to be in excess of R$ 350 million. Historically, Germ√¢nia is the fourth oldest football club of Brazil and was part of the first inter club match of the country. Until 1915 the club had won twice the State Championship of S√£o Paulo. Already early tennis grew popular among the club members and the club should become one of the co-founders of the Tennis association of S√£o Paulo. Football was basically abandoned with the advent of the professionalization of the sport in the 1930s. During the course of World War II the club abandoned references to its German origin and in 1941 was renamed to Pinheiros. In later years water polo was very popular. In the 1970s Jo√£o Carlos de Oliveira from Pinheiros held the world record in the triple jump. In more recent times the club has joined the national elite in basketball and volleyball, in the former even winning international titles. C√©sar Cielo won Olympic gold in swimming.  History  Logo of SC Germ√¢nia ca. 1909. Sport Club Germ√¢nia (S.C. Germ√¢nia) was one of the clubs which established football in Brazil, and was one of the clubs which participated in 1899, in the first inter-club match, and in 1902, in the first championship match of the country. Germ√¢nia was twice the winner of the state championship of S√£o Paulo, the Campeonato Paulista. The eminent player of the early days of the club was Hermann Friese, considered the first football player personality of Brazil. Arthur Friedenreich, the first great star of Brazilian football, and widely acknowledged as one of the all-time greats of the sport, commenced his career at Germ√¢nia in 1909. The football team in the early years. Club's founder, Hans Nobiling (with tie) poses with the players. After abandoning football in the early 1930s, due to the professionalization of the game, the club successfully transformed itself to a universal sports club. Already in 1932, the water sports department sent its first representative to the Olympic Games. Many more athletes from the club since represented Brazil in major international sports events, and swimmers like Gustavo Borges and C√©sar Cielo are among the club's Olympic medal winners. The basketball and volleyball teams play in the national top divisions, and the swimmers continue their dominance in Brazil. Beyond this, Pinheiros has departments for many more modalities, such as judo, gymnastics, and tennis. Since its merger with the Gesellschaft Germania, a social club of German immigrants, in the early 1940s, to form the Esporte Clube Pinheiros, named after the river Rio Pinheiros, flowing close by its seat, the club has also developed as a meeting place and venue for cultural events. These days, thousands of visitors pass daily through the club's restaurants, bars, and other facilities. Top stars of the Brazilian entertainment industry, like Daniela Mercury and Jorge Ben Jor have performed in the club's auditorium, which at its opening in 1957, was the largest of its kind in South America. Also classical music and theatrical plays are regularly on the schedule. Further facilities of the club include a kindergarten, library, and the Centro Pr√≥-Mem√≥ria Hans Nobiling, which comprises a museum displaying trophies and other memorabilia from the club's rich history, as well as the archives.  Activities  Nocturnal view across the greenery of the club, to apartment blocks along Rua Angelina Maffei Vita. = Basketball = In the 2005‚Äì06 season, EC Pinheiros participated for the first time in the professional first division of Brazilian basketball, but then failed to qualify for the single league that resulted from the merging of the conferences. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Pinheiros joined the new top Brazilian league, called the Novo Basquete Brasil, under the sponsored name Pinheiros/Sky.2¬∫ Novo Basquete Brasil ‚Äì Clubes Participantes , Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Basketball, (2010) The team plays at the Gin√°sio Poliesportivo Henrique Villaboim, on the club's grounds in Jardim Europa.

View across the tennis courts. = Tennis = By 1903, SC Germ√¢nia already had its first two tennis courts. In his later years, founding president Hans Nobiling became an enthusiastic tennis player and the club's interest in tennis grew dramatically. In 1924, SC Germ√¢nia won the State's top tennis club honor, the \\"Ta√ßa Brasil\\", or the Brazil Cup. The club was one of the founders of the state association \\"Federa√ß√£o Paulista de T√™nis.\\" By 1949, the now EC Pinheiros had 14 courts and was the largest tennis facility in Brazil. Today, EC Pinheiros has 24 courts, two of which are covered for play during inclement weather. Several times, the club has served as the host of matches for the Davis Cup, i.e. ‚Äì Brazil v.

Hermann Friese, who was German Champion over 1500 metres in 1902 and joined Germ√¢nia in 1903 was in 1907 Brazil's sole representative at an international tournament in Montevideo, Uruguay where he won two competitions and finished second in a third one. In 1924 Germ√¢nia was co-founder of the state athletics association Federa√ß√£o Paulista de Atletismo. By the end of the 1930s the club had a 70 strong group of athletes and dominated track and field in Brazil. Apart from many South-American records it held almost all national records. At the Games in 1932 in Los Angeles L√∫cio de Castro became the first athlete from EC Pinheiros to participate at Olympic Games. In the pole vault he cleared 3,90 metres and finished sixth. Jo√£o Carlos de Oliveira won triple jump bronze 1976 in Montreal and 1980 in Moscow. At the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico he won the long jump with 8.19 metres and surpassed the triple jump world record of Viktor Saneyev by 45 centimetres reaching 17.89 metres. This mark held for almost six years, when the US-American Willie Banks extended it to 17.97 which should stand for ten years. 18 metres should not be exceeded before mid 1995. Lately the club's athletes lined-up as EC Pinheiro/Asics.

In Brazil, certification bodies must be accredited by INMETRO. Electrical and electronic products that meet Brazilian requirements and that are certified by an INMETRO accredited organization must carry the mandatory INMETRO mark along with the mark of the certification organization, such as UCIEE (Uni√£o Certificadora para o Controle da Conformidade de Produtos, Processos ou Servi√ßos). General information INMETRO acts as Executive Secretariat of the National Council of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality (CONMETRO), an inter-ministerial collegiate entity which is the normative agency of the National System of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality (SINMETRO). SINMETRO, CONMETRO and INMETRO were created by Brazilian Law 5966, of 11 of December 1973. In this occasion, the INMETRO substitutes the National Institute of Weights and Measurements (INPM), significantly extending its range of performance for the Brazilian society. In the scope of its ample institucional mission, INMETRO aims to fortify national companies, increasing their productivity by means of the adoption of mechanisms destined to the improvement of the quality of products and services. Being so, INMETRO mission incorporates the promotion of the quality of life of the Brazilian citizens and the competitiveness of the Brazilian economy, by means of Metrology and Evaluation of Conformity concepts and mechanisms. Some of the main attributions of INMETRO are: * To execute the Brazilian Metrology and Evaluation of Conformity policies; * To verify the observance of the technical and legal requirements related to measurement units and methods and instruments, as well as its application to material products; * To keep the standards of the units of measurement, as well as to implement and keep the chain of traceability of measurement unit standards in the country, so as to guarantee that they are internally consistent and compatible with equivalent international standards, aiming at, in the primary level, to its universal acceptance and, in the secondary level, to its use as supporting the productive sectors of the economy, with a focus in the quality of goods and services; * To fortify the participation of Brazil in the related Metrology and Evaluation of Conformity international initiatives, and promoting the interchange with international entities and organisms; * To act as CONMETRO Executive Secretariat, providing technical and administrative support to its advisory committees; * To foment the use of quality management methods and techniques in Brazilian companies; * To plan and execute the activities of accreditation (credenciamento) of calibration and essay laboratories, proficiency essay suppliers, and organisms of certification, inspection, training and other activities necessary to the development of technological services infrastructure in Brazil; and * To co-ordinate, in the scope of SINMETRO, the obligatory and voluntary certification of products, processes, services and the voluntary certification of staff. History During the first Empire, several attempts had been made aiming to the standardization of measurement units used in Brazil, but only in 26 of June 1862, emperor Dom Pedro II promulgated the Imperial Law n¬∫ 1157 and with it officialized, in all the domestic territory, the French decimal metric system. Brazil was one of the first nations to adopt the new system, that would be later used in the whole world. With the following century industrial growth, it became necessary to create more efficient instruments of control in the country, so as to stimulate and to protect producers and consumers. Thus, in 1961, the INPM - Instituto Nacional de Pesos e Medidas (National Institute of Weights and Measurements) was created, implanting the Brazilian network of legal metrology and quality control, establishing the International System of Units (SI) in the Brazilian territory. Soon after, it became clear that it was necessary also to follow the international trends related to technological advances, accuracy and, mainly, attendance to consumer requirements. It was necessary, in other words, to develop and implement Evaluation of Conformity concepts. In 1973, INMETRO was created, in complementation to the CIP - Inter-ministerial Commission of Prices, including in its ample institucionalthe scope, the objective to strengthen national companies, increasing its profits by means of the protection to consumer rights and improvement of the quality of available products. Marking The institutional mark of the INMETRO is registered in the Federal Trademark and Patent Office - INPI - guaranteeing its property. INMETRO Certification =Automotive Components= In order to enter the Brazilian aftermarket, automotive components have to be labeled with the Inmetro Mark as well as a third party certification logo that has been accredited by Inmetro. These specifications were issued within the Inmetro Ordinance 301/2011 on 21 July 2011, which aims to establish minimum safety requirements for automotive components. Shock absorbers, electric fuel pumps for the Otto cycle engines, horns or similar equipment employed in automotive road vehicles, pistons, lock pins and lock rings, piston rings, bearing shell and lamps need to be compliant by January 21, 2013. Until then, manufacturers and importers have to be certified as automotive parts must be labeled with the Inmetro Mark from July 22, 2013.INMETRO, \\"Ordinance 301/2011\\" (Portuguese), Accessed 20.08.2012 The compliance deadline for automotive wheels has been postponed by Inmetro Ordinance 445/2010 to January 1, 2013.

He became well known because of his stylistic fusion of ancient, medieval and modern elements.  Life  He was born on 31 January 1857 in Palermo. His father Giovanni Battista Filippo Basile was also an architect and a professor at the University of Palermo. Ernesto graduated in 1878 as an architect in Palermo in the Royal School of Engineering and Architecture (). During the 1880s he lived in Rome. There in 1887 he married Ida Negrini and became assistant professor at the University of Rome. In the following years he was appointed professor of technical architecture in the University of Rome. At that period of his life he travelled in Brazil and in Spain. In 1890 he succeeded his father Giovanni, who died in 1891, as a professor of architecture. Ernesto Basile died on 26 August 1932 in Palermo.  Career  After graduation Basile took part in many architecture competitions. Ernesto Basile created a stylistic hybrid consisting of Roman, Norman and Arab influences. His father had started the construction of the opera house Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele in Palermo on 12 January 1874 but it was stopped for eight years from 1882 until 1890. From 1891 until the completion of the project on 16 May 1897 Basile was the supervising architect of the building. In 1881 Basile took part in a competition held by Francesco Crispi the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy, regarding the reconstruction of Palazzo Montecitorio, seat of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. In 1903 his project for the new parliamentary hall was selected and presented by the Prime Minister of Italy Giovanni Giolitti. Basile fused the Roman classicist and Baroque elements of the building with Art Nouveau imagery. The construction of the Italian parliament in the Art Nouveau style was one of the most important moments of early modernism in architecture. It was completed in 1927. In 1911 he was the architect of the construction of the town hall of Reggio Calabria. From 1907 until 1912 he built the Palazzo della Cassa Centrale di Risparmio in Palermo. In 1913-14 he built the Kursaal Biondo theatre, which had asymmetrical Baroque elements, in Palermo.

He earned the nickname of \\"The Little Man with the Big Stick\\" for his skill in handling large Parisian crowds.\\"L√©pine, Famous Paris Chief of Police, To Retire\\", The New York Times. February 25, 1913 He was responsible for the modernisation of the French Police Force. Under L√©pine the study of forensic science as a tool of detection became standard practise.Jean-Marc Berli√®re, Le pr√©fet L√©pine : vers la naissance de la police moderne, Paris, 1993. (French) Early life Louis L√©pine studied law in his home city of Lyon and in Paris and Heidelberg. He served with distinction in the French Army during the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871. Serving as a sergeant major at Belfort in the Alsace region, his unit was besieged and continually attacked by the Prussians. It surrendered only after the hostilities had ceased. L√©pine was awarded the M√©daille militaire for his bravery. He then embarked on a career as a lawyer and public administrator, a successful career that took in provincial postings that included deputy prefect of Lapalisse, Montbrison, Langres and Fontainebleau and then prefect of the Indres, the Loire and Seine-et-Oise.Louis L√©pine Mes Souvenirs, Payot, Paris (1929)  The 1893 student uprising in Paris  In 1893 L√©pine became prefect of police of the Seine (Paris) at a time when Paris and indeed France was politically volatile. The perceived failure of the previous Prefect Henri- Auguste Loz√© to quell serious student riots in 1893 resulted in L√©pine‚Äôs appointment. The riots that had taken place arose out of a trivial incident involving the arrest of an actress Sarah Brown, a student called Nuger and a confrontation with a policeman, the consequence of which was the death of Nuger. On the following Monday, 1,000 demonstrators marched onto the Chamber of Deputies, determined to be provided with an adequate explanation. The Deputies summarily retreated and by the evening a further 1,000 students were outside and by now the mood of the demonstrators had turned hostile. At the end of the day barricades were erected around the district of the Boulevard Saint-Germain.L√©pine, Famous Paris Chief of Police, To Retire\\", The New York Times, February 25, 1913 The police had lost control of the situation and the National Guard was called in to regain control. There followed several days of bloodshed as several important workers‚Äô organisations sided with the so-called students. Within five days of the arrest of Sarah Brown, the students were submerged within a violent mob that was ready to fight for control of Paris.\\"L√©pine, Famous Paris Chief of Police, To Retire\\", The New York Times, February 25, 1913 The French Republic seemed in danger and reacted with extreme force with an estimated 20,000 troops deployed to quell the uprising. It was against this backdrop that Louis L√©pine succeeded to the Prefecture of Police for Paris with a reputation as a disciplinarian prepared to use the \\"big stick\\" to keep Paris under control. L√©pine‚Äôs tactics were to allow the various factions to march through Paris but he used skilful and innovative tactics of crowd control to make sure that the various factions were, in effect kept apart, arriving at the planned rendezvous in stages. The modernisation of the police Louis L√©pine circa 1917 L√©pine is credited as the founder of modern French policing.Jean-Marc Berli√®re, Le pr√©fet L√©pine : vers la naissance de la police moderne, Paris, 1993. At the time of his first tenure the police had become renowned for corruption and low standards, trust between the police and the public was very low. L√©pine recognised that if France was not to relapse into military government the relationship between the civil police and the public had to change to become one of mutual trust. The assassination in Lyon in June 1894 of President Carnot, the 5th President of the Republic was the impetus for L√©pine to introduce measures to overhaul policing in France. Thus he set an agenda of reform beginning by carefully codified police procedures and regulations, improving the professional quality of the police force with the introduction of examinations and promotions and by introducing forensic science into the work of the detective. It was during his time as prefect of police that fingerprinting became established as a method of identification. The examinations for police that he instituted were very thorough: the tests for example included determining methods of forgery and examining lock components involved in a burglary so as to tell if a lock had been picked. As befits his training as a lawyer, his was the first prefecture to introduce criminology into policing and to examine the psychology of criminals. Amongst his other innovations, he introduced the white stick for directing traffic and established the river-boat brigade and armed police bicycle units. He installed a series of 500 telephone warning boxes to alert the public and fire services to fire, and he began the reorganisation of traffic movements within Paris by introducing one-way systems and roundabouts.  The Dreyfus Affair  Louis L√©pine & Georges Clemenceau in 1908. Governor of Algeria (1897-1899). L√©pine succeeded Jules Cambon as Governor-General of Algeria in September 1897, serving less than a year in the post. He was recalled to Paris as the Dreyfus Affair began to unravel the Third Republic. In 1894 Alfred Dreyfus, an Alsatian of Jewish descent, had been found guilty of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly having communicated French military secrets to Germany. L√©pine had officiated at the original trial. When two years later it became apparent that Dreyfus was innocent, as another culprit had been found, a retrial was ordered. The military court once again found Dreyfus guilty on the basis of false documents fabricated by French counter-intelligence officers. There was widespread dissent against the proceedings that culminated in a vehement public protestation from √âmile Zola, the novelist. Another retrial was subsequently ordered, and this time Dreyfus was freed, although he was not exonerated until 1906. France seemed to be at the start of civil unrest in 1899, and once again Louis L√©pine was recalled to help ease the situation. Again and again Paris appeared to be on the point of violent protestations, but through wise diplomacy and carefully organised policing, L√©pine managed to avoid the worst of times. He attempted to limit the role of the army as a force of internal order by handling most situations with police and gendarmerie alone. During these febrile times France faced the possibility of a military government and whilst there were occasions when L√©pine required military assistance to control demonstrations it is credit to his reforms that these were rare and that the gendamerie largely controlled the civil strife.Berli√®re, J.-M., Institution polici√®re en France sous la Troisi√®me R√©publique, 1875-1914, University of Bourgogne, 1991 (French)  Pr√©fet de police 1900-1913  A satirical view of L√©pine by Sirat from 1904 The final decade of L√©pine's tenure as pr√©fet de police proved not to be as politically dramatic as his early years. He continued in the task of reforming the police force intent on creating a modern police force to meet the needs of Paris and France. In 1900 he founded the Mus√©e des Collections Historiques de la Pr√©fecture de Police in response to the Exposition Universelle. The museum concentrated on the forensic science of policing and has gradually grown through subsequent years. It now contains evidence, photographs, letters, memorabilia, and drawings that reflect major events in the history of France (including conspiracies and arrests), famous criminal cases and characters, prisons, and daily life in the capital such as traffic and hygiene. L√©pine's realisation that the police required the support of the people to be effective was the catalyst to continue reform almost to the end of his tenure. In 1912 he founded a detective training school based on modern forensic methods of training. This was a lasting legacy and was a methodology admired and copied by other countries.Article in New York Times, August 25, 1912The article subtitled \\"M.L√©pine, Head of The Police Department,Creates a School for Training Detectives\\" is available at https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/08/25/100374695.pdf New York Times August 25, 1912. =Great Flood of Paris= L√©pine faced a number of high-profile events and crimes during this period of office. Each he handled with his usual decisiveness and belief in his own authority. In late January 1910, following months of high rainfall, the River Seine in Paris flooded the French capital, reaching a maximum height of 8.62 metres. The Great Flood of Paris as it is colloquially known caused extensive damage and forced thousands out of their homes. The infrastructure within Paris came close to destruction and there were major concerns for public health. France mobilised to save its capital. L√©pine whose office included public health proved as tough and authoritarian as he had been on policing matters. In the flood's aftermath he established new procedures to address the problems of flooding. The instructions explained the importance of chemical cleansing and institutionalized the growing medical consensus about the causes of water borne diseases that had been controversial just a few years earlier.David S Barnes,The Great Stink of Paris and the Nineteenth Century Struggles Against Filth and Germs, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore 2006Jeffrey H. Jackson, Paris Under Water: How The City of Light Survived the Great Flood of 1910, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) Armand Falli√®res, president of the French Republic and L√©pine worked closely with each other at the outset of the flood as they were concerned that Paris could dissolve into major disorder if the government response was seen to be ineffectual. In the event major disturbances were largely avoided. Throughout the crisis L√©pine was a visible presence attempting to lead from the front by reassuring Parisians that order would be maintained alongside the humanitarian efforts that were taking place. =The theft of the Mona Lisa= Louis L√©pine shortly before his retirement The theft on August 22, 1911 of the Mona Lisa from the Mus√©e du Louvre was more of an embarrassment to L√©pine although initially he acted with his usual decisiveness ordering the museum to be closed for a week whilst forensic analysis was carried out. French poet Guillaume Apollinaire came under suspicion; he was arrested and put in jail. Apollinaire tried to implicate his friend Pablo Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning, but both were later exonerated. The real thief was Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia an Italian wishing to return it to Italy. He was caught with the painting in Florence two years later when he attempted to sell it to the directors of the Uffizi Gallery. =The defeat of the Bonnot Band= One of L√©pine's last successes was the capture and destruction of the notorious Bonnot Gang (La Bande √† Bonnot), an anarchist criminal group that operated in France and Belgium during the Belle √âpoque, from 1911 to 1912. In 1910 L√©pine had instigated La Brigade Criminelle a dedicated unit of specialist law enforcers whose purpose was to gather intelligence and take direct action against high- profile criminals.Richard Parry, The Bonnot Gang, Rebel Press.(1987) . La Brigade Criminelles reputation was established after they were instrumental under L√©pine's leadership in destroying the Bonnot Gang. L√©pine ordered the leader of the gang Jules Bonnot to be captured on discovering his whereabouts in Paris. The operation began badly when three of his officers were shot during the operation. L√©pine then ordered the building to be blown up with dynamite and reputedly administered the final debilitating shot to the head of Jules Bonnot. = Concours L√©pine = Advertisement for the Concours L√©pine 1910 The Exposition Universelle provided the catalyst for innovation and L√©pine decided to create a competition for inventors that continues to be held annually to this day. It was originally intended to encourage small toy and hardware manufacturers, but over the years it has grown into an annual event that includes a multitude of innovative ideas. The 114th edition of the Concours Lepine Show took place over two weeks in April and May 2015 at the Foire de Paris in the Porte de Versailles. Louis L√©pine retired in 1913 and was succeeded by C√©lestin Hennion.In the same year he was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. He published his memoirs in 1929, four years before his death in 1933. He was the brother of the Professor Rapha√´l L√©pine, the pioneering physiologist.

Brook was born in Bradford in 1880 and was educated at Bradford Grammar School and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he was awarded 1st Class Honours in Modern History and Theology. He was Fellow and Tutor of Merton College, Oxford, 1906-19, and he contributed an essay in ‚ÄòFoundations‚Äô in 1912, an influential publication expressing ‚ÄòChristian belief in terms of modern thought‚Äô.Who Was Who,A and C Black When the Great War broke out, Brook joined the YMCA, serving in France, writing to diocesan bishops in 1915 seeking volunteers from the clergy to staff ‚Äòhuts‚Äô for soldiers in need of recreation and refreshments. His letter is referred to in many monthly diocesan gazettes.e.g. Chester Diocesan Gazette In 1916, Brook applied for a commission as a Temporary Chaplain to the Forces (TCF). His interview card described him as ‚ÄòTall. Suitable‚Äô and noted the names of his influential referees including the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. Brook was appointed and seems to have spent the bulk of his time at the Officers School at Brockton in Staffordshire. He was twice Mentioned in Despatches.What Did You Do in the Great War,Bishop? ' by Tom Scherb,Stand To!,no 95,2012,WFA The War led to a career change. In 1919, he was appointed Headmaster of Liverpool College where he remained for nine years. He then moved to parochial work as Vicar of Doncaster and Canon of Sheffield Cathedral and, in 1935, was appointed Archdeacon of Coventry.The Times obituary,2.2.1969 By 1940, although 60, Brook began to be seriously considered for a diocesan bishopric in England. The key figure in the appointment of bishops was the Prime Minister whose ‚Äòpatronage secretary‚Äô compiled evidence from many quarters particularly from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York. In 1940, the choice for the vacancy at Leicester rested between Brook and Vernon Smith, bishop of Woolwich and, on Archbishop Lang‚Äôs recommendation, Prime Minister Chamberlain nominated Smith who was appointed. Lang had described Brook as a scholar with parochial experience and had noted ‚ÄòMrs Brook I am told is quite admirable‚Äô. Smith was a bachelor but was already a Suffragan Bishop and this seemed to be his final opportunity for preferment.TNA PREM5/349Brook was more successful for St Edmundsbury in the summer of 1940. By then there was a new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who preferred ‚Äòwarriors‚Äô to ‚Äògownsmen‚Äô. Unsurprisingly, the choice rested between two 1st World War TCFs, Richard Brook and Russell Barry DSO. Lang preferred Brook since Barry had no rural experience and was ‚Äòdeaf‚Äô. Brook was appointed.PREM5/289 Brook‚Äôs early years in the diocese were hampered by wartime petrol rationing and the influx of temporary wartime personnel linked to the RAF and army bases. But Brook‚Äôs style brought criticism. He was regarded as an astute financier and administrator who ‚Äòwould have made a most successful captain of industry‚Äô. He was not the most approachable of bishops, allegedly having a notice in his study to the effect that if his callers did now waste his time, he would not waste theirs.Church Times obituary,7.2.1969He must have realised this deficiency because years after his retirement he would credit his secretary for easing the path to his study for nervous visitors conscious of his off-putting poster.Article written by Brook for magazine celebrating 50 years of the diocese,1964 He did have one considerable success with his post-War One Million Shilling Fund which raised over ¬£60,000 for the diocese to be spent on buildings, clergy stipends etc.St Edmundsbury monthly Diocesan gazettes from 1945However, it was Brook‚Äôs unpopular style which was evident in the note prepared by the Prime Minister‚Äôs 'patronage secretary‚Äô as the contextual background for the appointment of Brook‚Äôs successor in 1953. ‚Äò ... during the last 13 years Suffolk has had a Bishop who was largely academic and, without meaning to, failed to understand his people.

Among his projects was completing \\"floristic works on both the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains,\\" a study of the flora of Sierra San Pedro Martir, and a checklist for the entire Baja peninsula. = Thorne system = Among Thorne's many accomplishments was a system of plant taxonomy known as the Thorne system, first issued in 1968, and periodically revised from 1976 onwards (1977, 1983, 1992, 1999, 2007). =Fellowships and awards= * Cramer Fellow (Dartmouth College to attend Cornell University, 1941; declined a second Cramer Fellowship in order to enter Army Air Forces). * Research Associate Professor, University of Iowa, 1957. * Fulbright Research Scholar, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia, 1959‚Äì1960 (renewed once). * National Science Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and British Museum (Natural History), London, England, 1960. * Elected Foreign Member, Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, 1986‚Äìpresent. * Merit Award, American Botanical Society, 1996. * Madro√±o, Volume 45, 1999.

The band released a string of EPs and smaller releases through QnotQ and Eyesofsound until they broke up in 2008. After reuniting in 2012, they released a new single, \\"Pick Up Artist\\" (2013), and their debut studio album, Audio Noir (2016). History Following their 2006 debut release, .1, on the QnotQ label they toured extensively with a number of bands, including Cult of Luna, The Ocean, Yndi Halda, Baroness, Capricorns and The Hope Conspiracy. Bossk .2 was released by Eyesofsound in October 2007. Touring on the back of the release saw the band play shows throughout the UK with Devil Sold His Soul and Ephel Duath, and on continental Europe, with Cult of Luna and Humanfly. During early 2008, after an extensive jaunt around the UK with Kruger, original members Nick (drums) and Rob (guitar) left Bossk. Replacements were found and Bossk were back on the road with Textures for a brief stint in the Netherlands. In May 2008 the band played their 200th show and their first headline show at the Islington Academy in London. In October of the same year Bossk broke up. Two final shows were played and the .3 video EP was released, along with a trilogy box-set of all their EPs. In August 2009, a split with Rinoa was released. This was the band's final release and featured a soundboard recording of a new song which was to be used on the album the band were working on before they called it a day. Nick, Rob and Alex formed Eddie Falco in 2011 with members of Battle of Wolf 359 & The Shame. In February 2012, the band announced plans to record a live BBC Maida Vale session and play two shows at a later date. In 2013, Bossk released the single \\"Pick Up Artist\\" through the American indie hardcore punk label Deathwish Inc. Three years later in 2016, Bossk released its debut album titled Audio Noir also released through Deathwish. The band promoted the release with a music video for the track \\"Kobe\\".

The DFL creates 2D and 3D visualizations of the internal and external anatomy of fish obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and makes these publicly available over the web. The information core for the Digital Fish Library is generated using high-resolution MRI scanners housed at the Center for functional magnetic resonance imaging (CfMRI) multi-user facility at UC San Diego. These instruments use magnetic fields to take 3D images of animal tissues, allowing researchers to non- invasively see inside them and quantitatively describe their 3D anatomy. Fish specimens are obtained from the Marine Vertebrate Collection at Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) and imaged by staff from UC San Diego's Center for Scientific Computation in Imaging (CSCI). As of February 2010, the Digital Fish Library contains almost 300 species covering all five classes of fish, 56 of 60 orders, and close to 200 of the 521 fish families as described by Nelson, 2006.Nelson, Joseph S.

Background \\"The Peopletree Sessions\\" was originally issued on Bloch's People Tree Recordings label, from which it derives its name. Shortly after its original issuance, Jovovich and Turin publicly disagreed about the releases' legitimacy. Jovovich, who was filming The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc at the time, attempted to quell the spread of the release over the Internet while Bloch argued for its artistic merit. Legal action was never taken and Cherry Red Records has reissued the remastered CD version of the sessions. There are two versions released of the album. The first, being the standard version, with a black cover art, which includes sixteen tracks and one untitled hidden track. The second version, labeled as the UK Edition, with a complete different orange cover art, features the same track list, but also includes the tracks \\"Hi, It's Milla\\", \\"Loose Weight\\" and \\"Queen of the Parade\\" and does not include the remix of \\"House Of Spiders\\". In 2000, The Peopletree Sessions was chosen as the 'Pop CD of the Week' and given 3/5 stars by The Guardian, which called it \\"so barking, it's great\\".

It is native to western North America from British Columbia to California and Texas. Habitat Leymus triticoides often grows in moist habitat, sometimes with heavy and saline soils. It forms a solid root system which allows it to grow at water's edge and prevent the soil from eroding. Description This rhizomatous, turf-forming perennial grass reaches 1.3 meters in maximum height. The stiff, slender green to blue-green leaves stand away from the stems at an obvious angle. The inflorescence is a narrow spike of flowers up to 20 centimeters long.

In the early part of 1808 he was assigned to The Rower, a small village in County Kilkenny. He was Professor of Philosophy in the Maudlin Street College from September, 1811 to Summer 1814, and then at St Kieran's College at Birchfield until summer 1815. As well as teaching lay students, St Kieran's was both a minor and major seminary. On the appointment of his Uncle, Dean Nowlan, to the pastoral charge of Windgap and Dunnamaggan, in August, 1815, he succeeded him as Professor of Theology, and he became President of the College on the death of Father Quinlan in November 10, 1816. He served as both the President of the college and the Chair of the Theology Department until the summer of 1820. Bishop On July 19, 1820, Kelly was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Richmond, Virginia, in the United States. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Archbishop John Thomas Troy, O.P., with Archbishop Daniel Murray and Bishop Kyran Marum serving as co- consecrators. He sailed from Dublin on 9 October, and arrived in New York, after sixty days, on December 24. With a stop to visit Henry Conwell, Bishop of Philadelphia, Kelly proceeded to Baltimore, where he received a somewhat cool reception from the Metropolitan bishop Ambrose Mar√©chal. \\"He did not receive me over kindly,\\" he wrote his brother, \\"and tried to persuade me it would be dangerous to take possession of my See; but his arguments did not satisfy me, and I arrived Norfolk on 19th January.\\"Magennis, Michael I. J., \\"Bishop Patrick Kelly of Richmond, Va.\\", The American Catholic Historical Researches, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 4 (October,1910), pp. 347-349 American Catholic Historical Society Kelly took up residence at Norfolk, where there was a greater number of Catholics than at the episcopal see in Richmond, in January 1821. During his brief two-year-long tenure, Kelly opened the first Catholic school in the diocese and engaged in missionary efforts. However, due to jurisdictional differences with Mar√©chal, the Holy See decided to transfer him and Kelly was appointed Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in his native Ireland on February 9, 1822, and later died there at age 50 of inflammation of the lungs. He is buried in the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Waterford.

Life Kathleen Nott was born in Camberwell, London. Her father, Philip, was a lithographic printer, and her mother, Ellen, ran a boarding house in Brixton; Kathleen was their third daughter. She was educated at Mary Datchelor Girls' School, London, before attending King's College, London. She soon left King's College on an Open Exhibition scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford. The scholarship was in English Literature, but on arriving at Oxford, Nott switched to Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) in which she took a IVth in 1929.Oxford University Calendar, 1932, p.283 It was at Oxford that she met Christopher Bailey, an electronics and computer engineer, whom she was to marry in 1929. During the 1930s, Nott was a social worker and psychologist in the East End of London, an experience which would inspire her first novel, Mile End (1938), which is set in the area. Bailey's work took the couple to the Netherlands, from which they escaped when the German army invaded in 1940. During the war, Nott and Bailey lived in Bournemouth, and afterwards they moved to Sweden. Their marriage was dissolved in the 1950s, They had no children. It was her book The Emperor's Clothes (1953), which drew Nott to the attention of a much wider audience. An atheist, Nott attacked what she described as the \\"neo- scholasticism\\" of such dominant religious literary figures as T.S. Eliot and C.S. Lewis. In 1954, Nott began to contribute book reviews to The Observer; much of her critical work would appear in that newspaper. Essays and reviews by Nott were also published by Encounter, Partisan Review, The Nation, The Listener, New Society, Commentary, The Times and The Spectator. Nott's last review for The Observer was published in 1986. She also wrote extensively for the humanist and rationalist movement, and many of her articles were published in the Rationalist Annual, Question, and Humanist. She also translated books and articles. In the early 1970s, Nott moved to Horsham, where she lived with a friend. Later in the decade she moved in with one of her sisters in Thornton Heath. Nott was a member of the University Women's Club and the Society of Authors. In Who's Who she listed her recreations as playing the piano and gardening.http://www.ukwhoswho.com She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1977. Nott suffered from deafness and Parkinson's disease in her later years. When she died, Nott was living at Wemyss Lodge Residential Home in Swindon, Wiltshire. Critical reception Mile End (1938), Nott's first novel, was reviewed by the Times Literary Supplement. The reviewer felt that there was \\"something a shade clinical, a trifle too scientifically tolerant or indulgent, in the view of humanity unfolded here\\", and found Nott's prose \\"sharply individual but perhaps a little too mannered in its intellectual precision.\\" Nevertheless, \\"she gives the impression of having entered with astonishing acuteness and subtlety of mind into the impulses of the Jewish temperament, the psychological sway of Jewish religious lore and messianic tradition, the alien intensities of the social and domestic mood of the ghetto.\\" The reviewer concluded that it was \\"an admirably balanced story, which gains in narrative force and even in warmth as it advances.\\"\\"East End Jewry\\" [review of Mile End by Kathleen Nott] Times Literary Supplement, 3 December 1939, p.767. Nott's debut collection of poetry, Landscapes and Departures (1947) received a positive review in the Times Literary Supplement. The reviewer said that although Nott was a \\"difficult poet\\", her \\"quality as a writer is immediately obvious\\", concluding that \\"In spite of the difficulty of her poems, Miss Nott deserves to be read. She has a rich, harsh and rather masculine talent, and every poem here is full of vigour.\\"\\"An original poet\\" [Review of Landscapes and Departures by Kathleen Nott]. Times Literary Supplement, 24 May 1947, p.254. PEN Nott became involved in the writers' organisation PEN in the 1950s, becoming editor (initially acting editor) of the organisation's journal, PEN Bulletin of Selected Books (later renamed PEN International), in 1960. She held the post until 1988. She was briefly President of PEN in 1975,http://www.englishpen.org/aboutenglishpen/pastpresidentsofenglishpen/ staying on as a vice-president until the end of her life. Humanism and rationalism Nott was a committed humanist and rationalist, as signalled by the publication of her controversial The Emperor's New Clothes (1953), Writing on the occasion of Nott's death, a National Secular Society's former general secretary, Colin McCall, explained the significance of the book: > You need to realise the literary situation in post-war Britain to appreciate > the importance of Kathleen Nott... This was a time when T.S. Eliot reigned > supreme, not only as poet, but as critic; when Graham Greene, C.S. Lewis and > Dorothy L. Sayers were, in their different ways, spreading dogmatic > Christian orthodoxy; and when the Times Literary Supplement (January 22, > 1954) said the acceptance of authority in matters of religious belief \\"is > now once more an important constituent in European letters\\". It was the > philosophical inadequacies of this \\"constituent\\" that Kathleen Nott had > exposed in The Emperor's New Clothes...McCall (1999) Nott contributed chapters to H.J. Blackham's collection of essays, Objections to Humanism (1963) (a humanist response to Objections to Christianity from the same publishers), and The Humanist Outlook (1968), edited by A.J. Ayer. In \\"Is Rationalism Sterile?\\", Nott wrote: > To be too analytical, to demand explanations, reasons, and logical or moral > justifications can, we know, destroy human trust and therefore human > relations... Safeguarding, the longing for final reassurance characterises > all of us, rationalists and religious alike, and the prestige of objective > truth is only an intellectual parallel... It seems to me that the > 'theologians' on either side of the rationalist-supernaturalist controversy > have become mere case-makers, primarily out for proofs. (Natural enough, no > doubt, but meanwhile the riches of feeling, religious or human, have been > flung out with the bath-water.) It looks as if some kinds of argument, > whatever they appear to be about, can indeed be largely sterile because they > are not really aimed at finding a synthesis, a solution, at making peace. > They belong to a side, they are covert polemic, and they aim at victory. > With warfare of all kinds, truth is indeed the first victim.Nott (1963, p. > 68) For Nott, rationalism \\"in the nineteenth-century dyed-in-the-wool sense > of being almost wholly preoccupied with the question of the existence of > God, and with rebutting any supernatural sanction for morality\\", is > \\"sterile\\".Nott (1963, p.72) However, \\"I do not think that humanists have to be rationalists in the old sense.\\".Nott (1963, p. 78) In \\"Humanism and the Arts\\", Nott wrote that \\"humanists of our time are not as strong as they should be on the meaning and value of art and the artist.\\" She also admitted that \\"as soon as I begin to write about Humanism or speak from a Humanist platform I find myself in full retreat towards square nought. If someone does not ask me what or who is a humanist ‚Äì I find I am asking myself ‚Äì or the audience.\\"Nott (1968, p. 179). Returning to the theme of \\"Is Rationalism Sterile\\", Nott observes: > Many humanists seem to be just non-Godists. All they seriously worry about > is the mid-Victorian controversy and it is here that they seem irremovably > stuck... the large mass of contemporary literature has made at least one > thing clear: that on the subject of God's existence and of the supernatural > there is no longer any possibility of reasoned communication.Nott (1968, > p.180) Instead, Nott advocated that humanists should examine \\"the real possibilities of the real concrete human being.\\" She continued: > The job for the humanist is to try and extract the human values of religion, > to separate them out from the theological languages in which they disguise > themselves.Nott (1968, p.182) Nott was President of the Progressive League (1959‚Äì1961), and an honorary associate of the Rationalist Press Association, from 1979 until she died in 1999.Cooke (2003, p.322) Writings =Philosophy= *The Emperor's Clothes: an attack on the dogmatic orthodoxy of T.S.

French left school at an early age, and the first decades of his life were characterized by working a variety of jobs and recovering from prolonged illness. After co-founding a successful vehicular spring company, French gained prominence as a businessman and philanthropist in Pittsburgh during the second half of the 19th century. Early life Aaron French was born in 1823 in Wadsworth, Ohio to Philo French and Mary (McIntyre) French. He dropped out of school at age 12 to work as a farm laborer, later apprenticing as a blacksmith and working as an agent of the American Fur Company, among other jobs. In 1843, French married Euphrasia Terrill of Liverpool, Ohio, and they had five children, of whom three survived. Euphrasia died in 1870. In 1844, at age 20, French enrolled at the Archie McGregor Academy in Wadsworth for an additional year of schooling. Following this, he worked as a wagon maker in Illinois, but fell ill and spent four years recuperating in Ohio. Once recovered, French found work in blacksmithing for several railroad companies, eventually rising to the position of superintendent of blacksmiths and master mechanic for the now-defunct Racine & Mississippi Railroad in Racine County, Wisconsin. When the American Civil War broke out, French volunteered but was rejected for health reasons. Instead, he was elected sheriff of Racine County and served from 1862 to 1864. Business career While finishing his term as sheriff, French partnered with Calvin Wells to establish the A. French Spring Company in Pittsburgh, which manufactured vehicular springs. The company began with just 10 employees in a small rented building near Union Depot, and French hired his son, Philo Nelson French, to work with them. Wells stepped down in 1884, and in 1887, Philo French was appointed general superintendent. At this time, the company boasted around 450 employees and a facility spanning two city blocks, by some accounts the largest of its kind in the world. As French's business expanded, he grew to become one of Pittsburgh's most prominent citizens, gaining membership to elite organizations such as the Duquesne Club, the Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, and the Knights Templar. French also remarried, to Caroline B. Skeer of Chicago, and they had one child, Mary Adelaide, who died at age 18. Philanthropy Facade of the A. French Building at Georgia Tech French's business success also provided the funds and time to pursue philanthropy. He played a large part in the establishment of Georgia Tech's textile engineering department, which opened in February 1899, and was the young school's fourth department. French had met Lyman Hall, then president of the school, at a North Carolina summer resort, and Hall had convinced him of the need for a textile school in the South. French agreed to donate $2,500 unconditionally and an additional $3,000 if the government would match it; Hall convinced the state legislature to allocate $10,000. In recognition of this philanthropy, both the new school and the building that housed it bear French's name. The building still stands in what is now the Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District, and the textile school was expanded into Georgia Tech's School of Polymer, Textile & Fiber Engineering. Death French died in 1902, a day after his 79th birthday, in his Pittsburgh home. He was interred in a large polished-granite mausoleum in Allegheny Cemetery, unique in that cemetery for its Roman triumphal arch.

BjF with numbered carbon atoms Mechanism of action BjF is categorized by the IARC as possibly carcinogenic to human beings, like many other PAHs, on the basis of sufficient evidence in animals.K.Straif et al. (December 2005) \\"Carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\\" THE LANCET Oncology, vol.6, issue 12 For example, BjF is active as a tumor initiator on mouse skin and is carcinogenic in both mouse skin and in rat lungs. Recently, BjF was also found to induce tumors in newborn mouse lung and liver.J.E. Rice et al. (1 December 1987) \\"Identification of Tumorigenic Metabolites of Benzo[j]fluoranthene Formed in Vivo in Mouse Skin\\" Cancer Research 47, 6166-6170 The mechanism of actions of BjF is similar to other PAHs. The diolepoxide mechanism involves formation of stable and unstable DNA adducts, mainly at G and A, which can lead to mutations in proto-oncogenes (RAS) and tumour-suppressor genes (P53). Many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon diolepoxides and their precursor diols and epoxides are tumorigenic in animals. The radical cation mechanism involves generation of unstable adducts at G and A, leading to apurinic sites and mutations in HRAS. Orthoquinone formation could lead to stable and unstable DNA adducts and generation of reactive oxygen species, inducing mutations in P53.K.Straif et al.

History  Opened in 1802, the restaurant was named in honor of the Treaty of Amiens, a peace accord signed between Britain and France. In the beginning, its clientele were coachmen and domestic servants but later became frequented by actors and patrons of the nearby Opera House. In 1822, the new proprietor, Paul Chevreuil, turned it into a fashionable restaurant with a reputation for roasted and grilled meats. It was after the arrival of chef Adolphe Dugl√©r√© that the Caf√© Anglais achieved its highest gastronomic reputation. It was then frequented by the wealthy and the aristocracy of Paris. The Caf√© Anglais some months before its destruction The site now Although the white-faced exterior was austere, the interior was elaborately decorated with furniture in mahogany and walnut woods, and mirrors of gold leaf patina. The building included 22 private rooms and lounges. The London food reviewer and historian Lt.-Col.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Liberal MP, Trevelyan Thomson who had held the seat since 1918. Although Middlesbrough West had been Liberal since 1918 and the predecessor seat of Middlesbrough had been Liberal since 1886 (with the exception of the 1900 general election), no recent contest had been three-cornered and Trevelyan Thompson had made the seat so much his own that he had not even been opposed in 1924. So, there was no reliable way of knowing how the votes would fall. Candidates =Liberals= The Liberals selected Frank Kingsley Griffith, a thirty-eight-year-old barrister from London and formerly unsuccessful candidate at Bromley at the general elections of 1922, 1923 and 1924. Griffith was also Chairman of the National League of Young Liberals. It was reported that Trevelyan Thomson's wife, Hilda, had been approached as a possible candidate in succession to her husband but that her health ruled her out.The Times, 14 February 1928 p. 9 =Unionists= The Unionists chose as their candidate, local councillor and businessman Stanley Sadler. Sadler was the son of Samuel Sadler the first Conservative Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough and the founder of Sadler & Company, a chemicals business.The Times, 14 February 1928 p. 9 Stanley Sadler was a former Mayor of Middlesbrough.The Times, 24 February 1928 p. 9 =Labour= The candidate adopted for the Labour Party was also a local councillor. Huddersfield born Alonzo Ralph Ellis was a trade union official and councillor in Bradford.The Times, 14 February 1928 p. 9 The adoption of these candidates meant this was the first three-cornered contest in the constituency since it was created in 1918.The Times, 17 February 1928 p. 14 Issues Griffith issued his election address on 24 February, declaring himself an out and out Free Trader and stating that never before had Free Trade been so vital to industrial recovery at home and international amity abroad. The government's policy of protectionism was not applicable to the great national industries like iron and steel or shipping. He urged the government to put in hand great schemes of work and to allow local authorities to do the same to improve the infrastructure and create employment. It was ludicrous he argued to be paying the unemployed benefit to do nothing while improvement schemes such those at Middlesbrough docks were held up because of poor government accounting. Ellis countered by declaring that what was wanted was 100% socialism. The government must intervene to provide employment ‚Äì or work with a capital W, in his words. Sadler had previously put forward an argument that those receiving poor law relief (unemployment benefit) should lose their right to vote if they refused to take work. He was challenged on this during the campaign and said that at a time of high unemployment this should not apply as people were out of work through no fault of their own but in better economic times a man who would not work should not be entitled to vote.The Times, 24 February 1928 p. 9 It was reported however that Sadler was a strong defender of the Unionist government record in office and was particularly assured on the questions of safeguarding in industry (protectionism) and the economy.The Times, 8 March 1928 p. 14 Result The result was a narrow hold for the Liberals over Labour, a margin of just 89 votes, with the Tories in third place.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p. 196 Kingsley Griffith The poll showed that the popularity of the government was waning. Sadler and the Unionists had been expecting a higher vote and Labour advanced to a strong second place, presaging their win at the 1929 general election. For the Liberals the retention of the seat was a relief.The Times, 8 March 1928 p. 14 The result of this by-election came on the same day as the by-election in St Ives in Cornwall, which was a Liberal gain from the Unionists.C Cook & J Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 p. 59ff This double triumph for the Liberal Party was a boost to party morale, renewed under the dynamic leadership of Lloyd George and to the radical policy agenda of the coloured books and the manifesto We Can Conquer Unemployment being produced at this time.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 pp. 110‚Äì111 Aftermath Despite his slim majority this time however Griffith went on to hold the seat at the general elections of 1929, 1931 and 1935, the last of these in a three-cornered fight against Labour and National Labour opponents. When Griffith was appointed a county court judge in 1940, the seat was retained for the Liberals by Harcourt Johnstone in the resulting by- election, although under the wartime truce between the political parties, he was not opposed. Stanley Sadler clearly did not find national level politics congenial as he never fought another Parliamentary election. A R Ellis tried to win Middlesbrough West again in 1929 and then unsuccessfully contested Nottingham South in 1931. This turned out to be a false dawn for the Liberals however, as the result of the 1929 general election produced a strong advance in terms of the popular vote and percentage of poll share but only a modest improvement in the number of seats held overall.The Times House of Commons 1929; Politico‚Äôs Publications 2003 References See also *1940 Middlesbrough West by-election *1945 Middlesbrough West by-election *List of United Kingdom by-elections *United Kingdom by-election records West Category:1928 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1928 in England Category:20th century in North Yorkshire ","title":"1928 Middlesbrough West by-election"},{"id":"23879320","text":"Working For A Nuclear Free City is the debut album by Manchester (United Kingdom) indie band Working for a Nuclear Free City.

It was distributed by AP Newsfeatures for more than 25 years, illustrated by veteran magazine cartoonist Ralph Fuller and scripted by AP Newsfeatures comics editor William McCleery. Characters and story Launched two years before Prince Valiant, the strip was set in medieval times. Neither a prince nor a knight, Oaky Doaks was merely a muscle- headed farm boy who constructed his suit of armor from the tin roof of a shed. Setting out on his father's plow horse, Nellie, Oaky Doaks rode into a series of misadventures. Scoop described the strip's hero: By the 1950s, the principal characters were Oaky Doaks, King Corny, and Princess Pomona. One got the impression that there was a hopeless romantic relationship between Oaky and Pomona, though it was not certain who was in love with whom. Creators Ralph Fuller's Oaky Doaks McCleery was a prolific writer, and a list of his numerous credits offer some indication as to why he dropped the Oaky Doaks scripting chores. In addition to editing at AP, he was an editor at Life, PM and Ladies' Home Journal. He also was a special projects editor at Princeton University, and he wrote more than 15 plays, with two of his comedies playing on Broadway during the mid-1940s, followed by teleplays for The Philco Television Playhouse and other live television series of the 1950s. His children's book, Wolf Story, was illustrated by Warren Chappell. A Nebraska native, McCleery died January 16, 2000 in Princeton, New Jersey. Born in Michigan in 1890, Ralph Fuller was 16 when he sold his first cartoon to Life for $8. He studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and went to work as a staff artist for the Chicago Daily News. For years he contributed cartoons to Puck, Judge, Collier's, Harper's, Liberty, Ballyhoo, College Humor and The New Yorker. He had his own feature, Fuller Humor, in Judge during the 1920s. He moved to New York, began Oaky Doaks and eventually took over the writing as well as the art. In later years he drew Oaky Doaks from his home in Tenafly, New Jersey. Comics historian Maurice Horn commented, \\"Oaky Doaks was a solid entrygenuinely funny, superbly drawn and well written.\\"Horn, Maurice. The World Encyclopedia of Comics, Chelsea House, 1984. AP carried a set number of comic strips, so when the Oaky Doaks daily debuted on June 17, 1935, it replaced Harold Detje's Be Scientific with Ol' Doc Dabble which ran from June 6, 1932 until June 15, 1935. The Sunday Oaky Doaks, which began in October, 1941, was initially drawn by Bill Dyer (who also worked on The Adventures of Patsy) and later by Fuller. Reprints Oaky and Nellie were featured often on the covers of Famous Funnies which reprinted the strip. Eastern Color published an Oaky Doaks comic book in July, 1942. Oaky Doaks came to an end when the comics division of AP Newsfeatures folded in 1961. Ralph Fuller died two years later, on August 17, 1963.

It dates back to 1830 and gains its name from Queen Victoria, who as Princess Victoria of Kent visited the hotel in 1832 and who gifted the hotel with a pair of tortoise shells to commemorate the visit. The building has been extended over time and now operates as a hotel, bar and restaurant. History It was originally called the Union, and built on the site of the Bear Inn. Local people subscribed to the building project of the new Union, which was to be the principal hotel in the town, built with the fashionable five bays and two and a half storeys surmounted by a very shallow pediment of the period. The first manager was William Liddle who came from the Red Lion in Winchester. It was renamed in 1832 after the Princess Victoria visited it and she herself declared that it would now be called 'The Royal Victoria Hotel' The hotel grew to the rear after the demolition of the factories and workhouses, which were built along the back of the hotel. The hotel grew further with the building of a ballroom and cocktail bar in 1910. A second entrance from Water Lane was created for the use of people coming from the canal area, with Newport being on the main route to North Wales and Ireland.

He held that position for 28 years (1894‚Äì1922), until he retired. He had previously been Oldham's Medical Officer of Health. He lectured in Public Health in Manchester. He committed suicide in 1925. Background A son of Charles Niven, James was born in Peterhead on 12 August 1851. He graduated with a Scottish MA from the University of Aberdeen and from 1870 studied at Queens' College, Cambridge, gaining his BA in 1874 as 8th Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos and becoming a fellow at Queens'. His intention was to study engineering but he switched to the study of medicine after gaining his Cambridge MA in 1877. Niven trained in medicine at St Thomas' Hospital in London. He qualified in 1880, as MB, and worked first for the Metropolitan Asylums Board, being appointed an Assistant Medical Officer at the Deptford fever and smallpox hospital. It was not long before he left that post to take up a private practice in Manchester. Medical Officer of Health for Oldham In 1886, Niven left private practice after four years and was appointed as Medical Officer of Health for Oldham, a post that he held until 1894. He was simultaneously appointed as Medical Superintendent at Westhulme Hospital. During that time, he campaigned to have tuberculosis classed as a notifiable disease by the town's council, obtaining the support of local medical practitioners but failing in his pioneering aim. Doctors and physicians in Oldham raised enough money to send Niven to Berlin to study with Robert Koch, who had discovered the TB bacillus in 1882, thereby proving that the disease was not caused by \\"bad air\\" as was generally believed in accordance with the prevalent miasma theory. He also used Koch's treatment at the Oldham General Infirmary on his return, as well as dealing with smallpox, typhus, measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough. An Oldham Chronicle obituary of 1925 said: \\"Dr Niven also showed an interest in child welfare well in advance of his time.\\" According to medical historian William Povey, whilst at Oldham Niven was \\"instrumental in improving the standard of housing, of sewage and refuse disposal, of the milk and water supply, in reducing smoke pollution, and containing the spread of infectious diseases.\\" He wrote several papers on the latter subject and was awarded a BCh degree in 1889. Medical Officer of Health for Manchester Niven moved to his new post as Medical Officer of Health for Manchester in 1894 and remained in that role until his retirement in 1922. He succeeded John Tatham in the role after being preferred over 32 other applicants and became the longest-serving holder of the post, which was abolished in 1974. Niven dealt with many of the same public health problems in Manchester as he had while in Oldham. During his 28 year term of office, the city's population grew from 517,000 to 770,000 but the death rate per 1,000 population fell from 24.26 to 13.82 in 1921, largely as a consequence of his work. Among the notable strategies that he pursued was the conversion of 85,000 houses to water closets from pail closets and a more intensive slum clearance programme than had existed previously, which resulted in the demolition of 23,000 unsuitable houses. On Niven's initiative tuberculosis became a voluntary notifiable disease in the city in 1899.Observations on the History of Public Health Effort in Manchester by James Niven (1923). gtj.org.uk\\"Tuberculosis\\" in: The Book of Manchester and Salford, British Medical Association, George Falkner & Sons, Manchester, 1929, pp. 188‚Äì90 He was also responsible for Monsall Hospital, a fever hospital, being bought by Manchester Corporation from its then owners, the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Niven is noted for trying to restrict the impact in Manchester of the Spanish Flu pandemic that spread to Britain towards the end of World War I. He was probably the first Medical Officer of Health to enforce preventive measures to stop the spread of disease.Anne Hardy, The epidemic streets: infectious disease and the rise of preventive medicine, 1856‚Äì1900 (Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 255 In addition, the biographical records held by the Manchester Medical Collection note that he was \\"recognised as responsible for major improvements of public health in Manchester - slum clearance, milk supply, Monsall Fever Hospital, smoke pollution and health visiting.\\" His background in mathematics was advantageous for compilation of statistics and he became president of both the Epidemiological Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and the Manchester Statistical Society, as well as lecturer in public health. Life and legacy In 1923, Niven published Observations on the History of Public Health Effort in Manchester. Following his retirement in 1922 he suffered from depression and committed suicide on 30 September 1925 at Douglas on the Isle of Man by taking an overdose and swimming out to sea.Arnold, C. (2018). Pandemic 1918: Eyewitness Accounts from the Greatest Medical Holocaust in Modern History. St. Martin's Publishing Group, p. 322. He requested that he should be buried at sea and was survived by three daughters. During his lifetime, Niven received recognition for his pioneering work in Public Health. This included an honorary degree from the University of Aberdeen and the presidency of the Section of Public Health at the Annual Meeting of the British Medical Association in Manchester in 1902. The Royal Institute of Public Health awarded medals to him. A dramatisation of the Spanish flu period in Manchester was transmitted on BBC television as Spanish Flu: The Forgotten Fallen on 5 August 2009 and again on 25 September 2012Spanish flu drama, BBC, 24 September 2012.

History Souhegan Wood Products (SWP) was founded in 1941 when C. Randolph \\"Randy\\" Myer purchased a sawmill and began running a dressing mill in order to process some of the two billion trees downed by the New England Hurricane of 1938. The name \\"Souhegan\\" is derived from the nearby Souhegan River, a tributary of the Merrimack River. During this period, the amount of wood going to waste was overwhelming, and solutions to wood waste were in high demand. Randolph Myer, a 1924 graduate as a mechanical engineer of MIT, became interested in using wood waste from lumbering operations after working for Longbelle Lumber Company, out of Texas, on their operations in Washington state. There he observed the amount of waste remaining after processing. During World War II, SWP manufactured ammunition boxes for the government. The war also created such a sharp demand for lumber that SWP was distributing wood nearly as a fast as it was cut, not allowing the wood time to dry. Myer built a dry kiln, where wood could dry as rapidly as five days. By 1944, the company had developed a particle board called \\"Plaswood\\" that they manufactured until 1954, when the company expanded its manufacture of molded products. Location Souhegan Wood Products is housed at the Souhegan Mills, located in the town of Wilton in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. Wilton is located approximately northwest of Boston and southwest of Concord, the capital of New Hampshire. The mill was built in 1925 by the Souhegan Apple Packing Association for the sorting, storage, and packing of apples. In 1938 David Whiting and Sons purchased the property and turned it into a dressing mill. C. Randolph Myer purchased the mill in 1941 and installed a dry kiln; both the kiln and the mill burned in a fierce fire in 1944. The mill was rebuilt in the same year, and Souhegan Wood Products returned to the manufacture of ammunition boxes for the army. Wood Recycling Souhegan Wood Products acquires all of its waste wood from a variety of woodworking enterprises within 100 miles of its Wilton facility. In its 65-year history, SWP has produced a diverse array of wood products, including bases for brushes, wheel rims for tea carts, and Banjo heads. Currently SWP focuses on the manufacture of Belt-Winding shells, \\"Corsaver\\" core-plugs, center-hole core plugs, casket tops, as well as veneered casket tops. The Belt-winding cores are made from graded and softwood particles, combined under heat and pressure. They are extruded cylinders of graded wood particles compounded with high strength resins and square center holes. Present Souhegan Wood Products is in its fourth generation of family ownership. Current design developments include paper plugs, as well as a staved extruded core that provides both high beam and compression strength. Today, SWP ships its products nationally and internationally to customers in Mexico, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Malaysia, and South Korea.

Accessed October 9, 2012 Bromacil is one of a group of compounds called substituted uracils. These materials are broad spectrum herbicides used for nonselective weed and brush control on non-croplands, as well as for selective weed control on a limited number of crops, such as citrus fruit and pineapple. Bromacil is also found to be excellent at controlling perennial grasses. Safety There are quite a few safety precautions that should be taken when dealing with Bromacil. Dry formulations containing bromacil must bear the word \\"Caution\\" and liquid formulas must signal \\"Warning.\\" Care should be exercised when spraying Bromacil on plants because it will also stop the photosynthesis of the adjacent non-target plants, therefore killing them. Bromacil should never be used in residential or recreation areas for risk of exposure. Bromacil is slightly toxic if individuals accidentally eat or touch residues and practically nontoxic if inhaled. Bromacil is a mild eye irritant and a very slight skin irritant. It is not a skin sensitizer.Washington State Department of Transportation. ‚ÄúBromacil‚Äù. 2006, p.1-4. Accessed October 9, 2012 In studies using laboratory animals, bromacil is slightly toxic by the oral, dermal, and inhalation routes and has been placed in Toxicity Category IV (the lowest of four categories) for these effects. This herbicide should be stored in a cool, dry place and after any handling a thorough hand-washing is advised. In regards to occupational exposure, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recommended workers handing bromacil not exceed an exposure of 1 ppm (10 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average. Facts Bromacil (40%) is combined with the active ingredient diuron in the herbicide Krovar, which is used by companies such as the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). It is in a group of chemicals that are absorbed through the gut and excreted primarily in the urine. The half-life of bromacil in soils is about 60 days, but as long as 8 months in some conditions. Bromacil is available in granular, liquid, water- soluble liquid, and wettable powder formulations. Because bromacil is a possible human carcinogen and systemic toxicity may result from intermediate exposure (one week to several months), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessed risk to workers using several major exposure scenarios. Bromacil is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions. Applications Bromacil is applied mainly by sprayers including boom, hand- held, knapsack, compressed air, tank-type, and power sprayers. Bromacil is also applied using aerosol, shaker, or sprinkler cans. Solid forms of bromacil are spread using granule applicators and spreaders. Application using aircraft is allowed only for Special Local Need registrations to control vegetation on the Department of Defense's Yakima Firing Center in the state of Washington.

It is used to match the refractive index of PMMA for example in confocal microscopy of colloids. A mixture of cis-decalin and CXB can simultaneously match optical index and density of PMMA.Wiederseiner, S., Andreini, N., Epely-Chauvin, G. & Ancey, C. Refractive-index and density matching in concentrated particle suspensions: a review. Experiments in Fluids 50, 1183‚Äì1206 (2010).doi:10.1007/s00348-010-0996-8 Due to the moderate dielectric constant of CXB (Œµ = 7.9 ), PMMA acquires charges that can be screened by the addition of salt (e.g. tetrabutyl ammonium bromide), leading to a very good approximation of colloidal hard sphere.Royall, C. P., Poon, W. C. K. & Weeks, E. R. In search of colloidal hard spheres. Soft Matter (2012). doi:10.1039/c2sm26245b A drawback is that CXB is a good solvent for PMMA, causing it to swell over time, which may lead to a poor determination of particle radii and determination of solid volume fraction.Poon, W. C. K., Weeks, E. R. & Royall, C. P. On measuring colloidal volume fractions. Soft Matter 8, 21 (2012). doi:10.1039/c1sm06083j  Synthesis  Bromocyclohexane can be prepared by the free radical substitution of bromine to the cyclohexane ring at high temperatures or in presence of electromagnetic radiation. But the reaction is not selective and it gives a mixture of polyhalogenated products. Another synthesis path is the addition of HBr on cyclohexene.

It has applications in geophysics, seismic imaging, photonics and more recently in neural networks. Ricky T. Q. Chen, Yulia Rubanova, Jesse Bettencourt, David Duvenaud Neural Ordinary Differential Equations Available online The adjoint state space is chosen to simplify the physical interpretation of equation constraints.Alain Sei & William Symes. Gradient Calculation of the Traveltime Cost Function Without Ray-tracing. Expanded Abstracts, 65th Annual Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) Meeting and Exposition, pages 1351‚Äì1354 (Available online ) It may take the form of a Hilbert space. Adjoint state techniques allow the use of integration by parts, resulting in a form which explicitly contains the physically interesting quantity. An adjoint state equation is introduced, including a new unknown variable. The adjoint method formulates the gradient of a function towards its parameters in a constraint optimization form. By using the dual form of this constraint optimization problem, it can be used to calculate the gradient very fast. A nice property is that the number of computations is independent of the number of parameters for which you want the gradient. The adjoint method is derived from the dual problem and is used e.g. in the Landweber iteration method . The name adjoint state method refers to the dual form of the problem, where the adjoint matrix A^*=\\\\overline A ^T is used. When the initial problem consists of calculating the product s^T x and x must satisfy Ax=b, the dual problem can be realized as calculating the product , where r must satisfy A^* r = s . And r is called the adjoint state vector.

License managers protect software vendors from losses due to software piracy and enable end-user organizations to comply with software license agreements. License managers enable software vendors to offer a wide range of usage-centric software licensing models, such as product activation, trial licenses, subscription licenses, feature-based licenses, and floating licensing from the same software package they provide to all users. A license manager is different from a software asset management tool, which end- user organizations employ to manage the software they have licensed from many software vendors. However, some software asset management tools include license manager functions. These are used to reconcile software licenses and installed software, and generally include device discovery, software inventory, license compliance, and reporting functions. An additional benefit of these software management tools are that they reduce the difficulty, cost, and time required for reporting and can increase operational transparency in order to prevent litigation costs associated with software misuse, as set forth by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance ‚Äì Transparency and Responsibility 2015, Beth Stewart, itispivotal.com.

History Wat Chiang Man was built by Mangrai in 1297 CE as the first temple of Chiang Mai on the location of Wiang Nopburi, a fortified town of the Lawa people which had been used by King Mangrai as a camp during the construction of his new capital city Chiang Mai.http://www.chiangmainews.com/indepth/details.php?id=373 Sights Plan of Wat Chiang Man *Chedi Chang Lom - the 'Elephant Chedi' is the oldest construction within the temple complex. The square base supports a second level which has the front half of 15 life-sized brick-and-stucco elephants emerging from it. The elephants seem to carry the upper levels of the building on their backs. The gilded upper part of the chedi contains a bell shaped relic chamber directly underneath the pinnacle. *Main Wihan - the larger of the two wihans was renovated in the 1920s by the famous monk Khru Ba Srivichai. The building houses a large mondop structure for an altar surrounded by Buddha statues. One of the standing Buddha's has the year 1465 CE engraved on its base, which would make it the oldest statue of the Lanna Kingdom. It is also the oldest statue of Thailand which shows the Buddha with an alms bowl. The fa√ßade of the wihan features gilded carvings of Kirtimukha in between flower and plant motives. *New Wihan - the smaller of the two wihans houses two important statues of the Buddha which, due to their protective powers, are regarded as the Palladium statues of Chiang Mai:  The Phra Sae Tang Khamani is also known as the 'Phra Kaew Khao' or 'Crystal Buddha'. This 10 cm tall statue is carved out of a clear quartz crystal. According to Oliver Hargreave,Oliver Hargreave: Exploring Chiang Mai, City, Valley & Mountains the statue was crafted around 200 CE for King Ramraj of Lopburi and brought to the Hariphunchai Kingdom (present day Lamphun) by Queen Jamadevi in 662 CE. It was only transferred to Chiang Mai by King Mangrai in 1296 after he had conquered Lamphun. As it survived the pillaging of that city, the statue is thought to protect against disasters. However, Carol StrattonCarol Stratton: Buddhist Sculpture of Northern Thailand dates the statue as having been created in the 15th century based on its style characteristics. The gold covered wooden base and golden canopy are later additions donated by King Inthawichayanon of Chiang Mai in 1874. Together they contain more than 6 kg of gold. The Phra Sila statue is a stone stele depicting a standing Buddha whilst taming the elephant 'Nalagiri' in bas- relief. The temple states that the statue originated from India before being transferred to its present location. However, others believe the statue originated from Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) and might date from either the 8th or 10th century CE depending on the source . Due to the religious belief that the statue has rain-giving powers, this statue features prominently in the Songkran festival at the end of the dry season. *Ubosot - in front of the ubosot one can find a stone stele from the year 1581 CE. This stele contains the oldest mentioning of the founding date of Chiang Mai: the 12th of April, 1296 CE at 4 am. It also mentions that the ubosot was commissioned by King Mangrai and that Phya Saen Luang had it restored in 1571. The present building was built in the 19th century. *Ho Trai - the Temple Library (scripture depository) of Wat Chiang Man is of a fairly plain design when compared to the Ho Trai belonging to Wat Phra Singh. It is a wooden building set on top of a high plastered brick base.

It was deactivated in 1981 and relit as a private aid to navigation by the Friends of Acadia National Park in 1989. Bear Island Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Bear Island Light Station on March 14, 1988. Description and history Bear Island Light was authorized by federal legislation signed by President Martin Van Buren in 1838. The government acquired of land at the southwestern end of Bear Island, and in 1839 constructed a stone keeper's house, on top of which a light was mounted. This structure burned in 1852, and was replaced the following year by a brick tower. A fifth order Fresnel lens was installed in the tower in 1855, and a fog station was added in 1888. In 1889 the 1852 tower was torn down and most of the present complex of buildings was constructed. The Coast Guard discontinued the light in the 1980s, replacing it with an offshore buoy with a bell and light. The Bear Island property became part of Acadia National Park in 1987. The station was restored in 1989 by the Friends of Acadia, and relit as a private aid to navigation. Bear Island Light The tower is a cylindrical brick structure, in height, with an attached gable- roofed workroom, and was built in 1889. It is topped by a polygonal lantern chamber, with a surrounding iron parapet and railing. There are two narrow windows in the tower, and two into the workroom, which also has the entrance providing access to the tower. The keeper's house is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof pierced by gable-roof dormers. The light station includes three outbuildings. The largest is a gable-roofed barn, set at a remove from the keeper's house and tower. Just to the barn's southwest is a small stone oil house, built in 1905. To the northwest of the tower is the station's boathouse and slip. The boathouse is a frame structure with a gable roof and shingled sides, and was also built in 1905.

Development The Knight was a conventional looking low-wing monoplane, with a fixed tailwheel landing gear, the main legs housed in trouser fairings and powered by a nose-mounted 90 hp (67 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Minor piston engine. It had an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seating for two. It had an unusual wing construction which used four spars and interspars instead of ribs.

Known for tackling Southern racial issues, Somerville‚Äôs works incorporate collage painting and sculptural elements, as well as site-specific installations.  Early life and education  Somerville was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1963. His parents, both European American, were civil rights activists, his father worked as an Episcopal preacher and his mother was a schoolteacher. Somerville grew up in various cities and rural towns throughout the Southern United States. He briefly studied at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), Baltimore, Maryland, finally settling in San Francisco in 1984 where he attended the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI).  Work  Somerville‚Äôs work simultaneously tries to reconcile his personal struggle with his own Southern Christian upbringing and the overt tumultuous racial politics of then with the mixed messaging backlash of now. Using collaged and painted pictorial elements, he summons imagery and words from the history, politics, popular culture, and fine art into juxtapositions that challenge conventional lines of history and social perceptions. For example, his piece, Boy in the Hood, 2000, portrays Malcolm X wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood. In an interview with Nathan Larramendy, Somerville stated, ‚ÄúMy southern identity will always play a part in my work because that is who I am... I feel the overall theme [of my work] is oppression and greed. I want the oppressed to be validated and the oppressors to be guilty.

Together with shipping magnate Thomas Fearnley, the brewery sponsored the polar expeditions of Fridtjof Nansen and Otto Sverdrup, and funded the construction of the exploration vessel Fram. This led to Heiberg's name being given to Axel Heiberg Island in Canada, the Axel Heiberg Glacier in Antarctica as well as Heiberg Islands in Siberia. In 1878 Heiberg was one of the founders of the rowing club Christiania RK. Later he founded the \\"Consul Axel Heiberg and Manufacturer Hans B.

Hunting is a popular recreational pursuit and a tourist activity in New Zealand with numerous books and magazines published on the topic. Unlike most other developed countries with a hunting tradition, there are no bag-limits or seasons for hunting large game in New Zealand. Hunting in national parks is a permitted activity. The wide variety of game animals and the limited restrictions means hunting is a popular pastime which has resulted in a high level of firearms ownership among civilians. Prior to human settlement New Zealand had no land based mammals other than two species of bat, one of which is now extinct, and two species of seal. European settlers introduced a wide range of animals including some specifically for game hunting. Acclimatisation societies were active for a period of 60 years from the 1860s in having introduced animals established in New Zealand. The majority were introduced for food or sport. In the 1980s Recreational Hunting Areas (RHA's) were set up to support recreational hunting on conservation land. The RHA's are administered by the Department of Conservation. Guided or independent hunting is open to non-resident hunters with a firearms licence and permit issued by the Department of Conservation. Because of the number of large game species and varied terrain available, New Zealand is a popular destination for hunting-based tourism. Government sanctioned deer culling By the 1950s red deer were recognised as an animal pest which damaged the natural environment and the government began employing hunters to cull the deer population to prevent this damage. Networks of tracks with bridges and huts were set up to gain easy access into the backcountry. These tracks and huts, now maintained by the Department of Conservation, are popular for tramping. Types of hunting =Chamois= Chamois is a goat-antelope native to Europe. Alpine chamois arrived in New Zealand in 1907 as a gift from the Austrian Emperor, Franz Joseph I. The first surviving releases were made in the Aoraki / Mount Cook region and these animals gradually spread over much of the South Island.A Note on the Chamois in New Zealand at New Zealand Ecological Society They are often referred to colloquially as \\"chamy\\" (pronounced \\"shamy\\"). In New Zealand, hunting of chamois is unrestricted and even encouraged by the Department of Conservation to limit the animal's impact on New Zealand's native alpine flora.Recreational hunting in Nelson/Marlborough - Chamois at the Department of ConservationHeritage Preservation (p. 40 and 45) at the Department of Conservation =Deer= ;Fallow deer (Dama dama) A smaller species of deer in New Zealand. Various genotypes exist with differing colour phases: (i) common, (ii) melanistic, (iii) menil and (iv) white. They are often found in bush closer to pasture/farmland, as they prefer grazing on grasses. Major herds are found in the North and South Islands of New Zealand. ;Red deer (Cervus elaphus scoticus) The red deer in New Zealand produce very large antlers and are regarded as amongst the best in the world by hunters. Along with the other introduced deer species they are however regarded as a pest by the Department of Conservation and have at times been heavily culled using professional hunters. Additionally many hunters and outdoors enthusiasts class deer in NZ as a resource, for both food, hobbies, and an economic (tourist attraction). Ongoing issues over their pest status continue to be debated between parties. ;Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) A shy and challenging deer to find in New Zealand. Larger populations are found in Te Urewera National Park. Very elusive. ;Sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) A large bodied deer, antlers of 6 points are standard for mature stags. They are hunted on public and private land in the North Island of New Zealand. ;Sika deer (Cervus nippon) Sika deer were confined to the Kaweka and Kaimanawa Ranges but have been discovered in the Tararua and in Coromandel Ranges. It is thought that they had been transferred by recreational hunters. In 2009 it was discovered that they had been illegally released in the Toatoa Valley. Sika deer are one of the most sought after deer species to hunt in New Zealand. They are smart, beautiful animals and very cunning. Found in the central North Island, many hunters and tourists enjoy chasing these noisy (have a squeak/squeal as an alarm call), elusive animals. The Department of Conservation have been working with hunters to target mainly hinds, which ensures stags can develop to trophy potential and allow hunters (and tourists) the chance to secure a lifetime trophy. ;Moose (Alces alces) Ten moose were introduced in Fiordland in 1910 but they were thought to have died off. Nevertheless, there have been reported sightings that were thought to be false until moose hair samples were found by a New Zealand scientist in 2002. Moose have had patchy sightings since the last was shot in 1956. There is still ongoing debate over their existence and likely will be until legitimate footage is taken, or an animal is shot. ;Wapiti (Cervus elaphus nelsonii) Found in the Fiordland National Park. These are large animals, growing very large antlers. Length has exceeded 55 inches in historic herds, but interbreeding with red deer has reduced the pure wapiti genetics. Antler length and spread often do not exceed 45 inches. Fiordland Wapiti Foundation have been working with Department of Conservation to actively control and protect this historic herd for hunting, through management of the population. This involves culling of red deer through aerial recovery, and also culling of hybrid red/wapiti in selection for pure wapiti type animals. Slowly genetics are becoming more pure wapiti, and antler length/points/span is increasing once again to trophy status. ;Whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) These deer are found in the lower South Island, but predominantly on Stewart Island. They are challenging and elusive to hunt. They are much smaller in size compared to the American counterparts and do not produce trophy heads as large. Often the environment itself is an attraction to hunters, where many native birds are present, including kiwi roaming the forest during the day. =Pigs= They are widespread throughout New Zealand and commonly are hunted using dogs. Pigs range in size and in the wild can exceed 250 pounds. They are sought after by hunters as they have a unique free range taste. They can cause a large amount of damage to the environment through rooting up of native plants. =Tahr= The Himalayan tahr sculpture unveiled in May 2014 at Lake Pukaki by Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford Himalayan tahr, often simply known as \\"tahr\\", were gifted to the New Zealand government by the 11th Duke of Bedford in 1903; of the three males and three females, five survived the journey from Woburn Abbey and were released near the Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village. He sent a further shipment in 1909 of six males and two females. Himalayan tahr are near-threatened in their native India and Nepal, but are so numerous in New Zealand's Southern Alps that they are hunted recreationally. At their peak in 1970, some 40,000 were in New Zealand. By 1984, the numbers had fallen to between 1,000 and 2,000 due to demand for tahr meat, which triggered a moratorium on commercial harvest. The Department of Conservation controls numbers to below 10,000. A statue of a Himalayan tahr was unveiled in May 2014 at Lake Pukaki and dedicated by Henrietta, Dowager Duchess of Bedford. Tahr are sought after by hunters for their meat, horns and skin. During winter bull tahrs develop a heavy mane and coat that is attractive as skin or rugs. Most hunters in New Zealand attempt to gain a trophy through climbing into the area where the tahr roam, upwards of , although hunting by helicopter has become more common in recent years. =Duck shooting= The duck shooting season opens in the first weekend of May and runs for 3 months. A licence must be obtained from Fish and Game New Zealand every season, at a cost of $80NZD (2010 Adult). These can be purchased from most outdoor sporting stores. Strict laws govern the number of birds which are allowed to be taken daily and may change between provinces. Laws also state that ducks must be shot with a shotgun while on the wing (flying). Although a mercy shot on the ground or water is an ethical responsibility of the hunter should a bird be injured during the initial shooting. In 2006 lead shot was banned from use while using 10 or 12 gauge shot on game birds within 200 m of any waterway. Nontoxic shot, mainly steel, is being used as a replacement. Hunters often build blinds known as \\"maimais\\" to conceal themselves from ducks, often these are permanent structures besides or on rivers, lakes, lagoons or ponds. They vary in size from small (3x3m), to two storied house sized buildings, complete with running water and electricity. These maimais are then elaborately camouflaged, usually using a combination of live and dead vegetation, camouflaged paint jobs and camouflaged netting. Hunters will also hide in the vegetation near a waterway as a temporary maimai. To aid luring ducks in, a variety of decoy ducks and duck callers can be purchased commercially, although some hunters prefer to make their own. Duck species which may be legally hunted are the mallard (and hybrids thereof), Pacific black duck (known as grey ducks), paradise shelduck, and Australasian shoveller.http://hunting.fishandgame.org.nz/sites/default/files/GameBird%20NI%202014-15.pdf Most hunters use specially trained dogs to retrieve ducks which land on the water, and many discussions are held about the best breed for the job, although most will agree that almost any breed can be trained to retrieve. Game birds in New Zealand are managed by Fish and Game New Zealand, previously the acclimatisation societies of New Zealand. Legislation The Wild Animal Control Act 1977 regulates commercial and recreation hunting, and established the RHA's. In 2012 the Game Animal Council Bill was opened up for submissions with the primary aim of establishing a Big Game Hunting Council as part of a national wild game management strategy. The bill is part of a support agreement between United Future and the National Party. Organisations The Conservation Act 1987 established Fish and Game New Zealand as a statutory body to advocate for recreational hunting and fishing in New Zealand. It has statutory responsibility for the sports of freshwater sport-fishing and gamebird hunting. They are funded predominantly from the sale of hunting and fishing licenses. The New Zealand Deerstalkers Association was established in 1937 to promote the interests of hunters in New Zealand. Outdoor Recreation New Zealand lobbies for the hunting and fishing community. From 2002 to 2007 it functioned as a registered political party. In 2011 the New Zealand government established the Game Animal Council to manage game animals. As well as managing tahr, chamois, deer and pig the Council will promote hunters' safety and improve hunting opportunities. The New Zealand Deerstalkers Association and Tourism Industry Association welcomed the formation of the Game Animal Council but Forest and Bird, a large nationwide conservation organisation, sees it as an impediment to recreational hunters. The New Zealand Game Industry Board is a statutory marketing authority established by regulations made under the Primary Products Marketing Act 1953.

It takes its name from the ancient manor of Debden, which lay at its northern end. The area is predominantly residential, but is also the location of Epping Forest College, East 15 Acting School and the De La Rue printing works. It is one of a limited number of places outside Greater London to be served by the London Underground. History The name (Deppendana in the Domesday Book of 1086) is derived from the Old English dep, 'deep' and den, 'valley'. Debden originated as a manor of in the Ongar hundred of Essex. The manor became the property of Waltham Abbey in 1086. By about 1254 the manor of Loughton had absorbed Debden. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 the manor passed to the king and later to private owners. In 1944 John Maitland sold of land to the London County Council for the building of a housing estate. The Debden Estate was constructed between 1947 and 1952. Because of post-war restrictions on building, a supermarket could not be opened until 1952. Debden station on the London Underground is a renaming (1949) of the Chigwell Lane railway station, which was originally opened on the Great Eastern Railway in 1865. Economy There is considerable light industry, including the De La Rue print works, which prints Bank of England banknotes. In 2005, Higgins Group PLC moved its headquarters to Debden, and, in 2008, Amstrad announced its intention to move the group HQ to Debden from Brentwood. A new HQ was opened in 2013 nearer the centre of Loughton. The Broadway is one of Loughton's two main shopping centres and forms an architecturally important parade consisting mainly of family-run shops together with a small weekly market. Transport The area is served by Debden tube station on the Central line of the London Underground. Debden is located next to the M11 motorway, about from its junction with the M25 motorway. The local motorway junction has restricted access: drivers cannot enter the M11 northbound or exit it southbound. These restrictions are designed to prevent congestion on the local road network. Motorway traffic must instead flow to and from the North Circular road. There are many bus routes in Debden, which are either London Buses routes, commercial routes or Essex County Council contract routes. London Buses routes 20 and 397 serve destinations south of Debden such as Chingford, South Woodford and Walthamstow. Routes operating to destinations north and east of Debden are commercial services Destinations include Epping, Harlow, Romford, Theydon Bois, Abridge, Waltham Abbey and Waltham Cross. Sport, culture and politics The local Debden Sports Club, founded in 1948, includes a football team that competes in local leagues. Until 2014, there was an annual Debden Day celebration. Debden is the location of the British Postal Museum Store. Debden Community Association was founded circa 1950 and formerly had premises at Loughton Hall and on land owned by Epping Forest College. Most council seats in Debden were held until 2004 by the Labour Party. Then a swing to the British National Party occurred, but the BNP lost its last seat to the Loughton Residents Association in 2012. See main article Politics of Loughton.

It is a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Turbinellidae, and is the only species in the genus Syrinx. This is the largest extant snail (shelled gastropod) species in the world, and arguably the largest (heaviest) gastropod in the world. Although the shell itself is quite well known to shell collectors because of its extraordinary size, little is known about the ecology and behavior of the species, except for one study about its feeding habits.  Taxonomy  1681 engraving of a shell of Syrinx aruanus by Filippo Bonanni. Here the coiling of the shell appears to be reversed, this is due to the engraving process. In 1681, Filippo Bonanni depicted this species in one of the first books ever published that was solely about seashells.Buonanni's Chiocciole (1681) . Accessed 8 August 2009. The book was entitled: \\"Ricreatione dell' occhio e dela mente nell oservation' delle Chiociolle, proposta a' curiosi delle opere della natura, &c.;\\" Bonanni F. (1681).

The taxonomic affinities of Syrinx aruanus were not properly understood for a long time. Until fairly recently it was placed in the family Melongenidae. A detailed taxonomic overview of this species was provided by Harasewych & Petit (1989).Harasewych M.G. & Petit R.E. (1989). \\"The nomenclatural status and phylogenetic affinities of Syrinx aruanus Linne, 1758 (Prosobranchia: Turbinellidae)\\". The Nautilus 103(2): 83‚Äì84.  Description  Dorsal view of a shell This is the largest Recent (as opposed to fossil) shelled gastropod, and the largest shelled gastropod by weight. (However, the largest shell-less gastropod or slug is Aplysia vaccaria, a giant sea hare known as the California black sea hare. The largest A. vaccaria has been measured at 99 cm in length and weighing in at almost 14 kg). An extremely large species of fossil gastropod is Campanile giganteum. The overall height (also known as length) of the shell of S. aruanus is up to 91 cm (see also Hawaiian Shell News, 1982). The weight of the shell is about 1800 g. Drawing of the protoconch, from Tryon, 1887 The shell is usually pale apricot in color, however in life it is covered by thick brown or grey periostracum. The shell color can fade to a creamy yellow. The whole shell has a spindle-like shape. The spire of the shell is high. The whorls usually have a strong keel which can have nodules on it. The shell has a long siphonal canal. There are no folds on the columella, unlike some other genera within the same family. Juvenile shells show a long tower-shaped protoconch or embryonic shell of 5 whorls, which is usually lost in the adult. This protoconch is about 2.5 cm long and looks so unlike the adult shell that it was described by George Washington Tryon in 1887 as a different species. The weight of the animal (including the shell) can be up to 18 kg (40 lb). The radula of this species was described in detail by Wells et al. (2003).  Distribution  In Endo Shell Museum This species occurs in the northern half of Australia and adjacent areas, including eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.  Ecology  These giant snails live on sandy bottoms in the intertidal zone and the sublittoral down to about 30 m.Carpenter K. E. & Niem V. H. (eds.) (1998).

Rome, FAO, ISSN 1020-4547, 686 pp., pages 603-617, page 605. Where it has not been overfished, this snail is locally common. (Abbott & Dance, 1982) This carnivorous species is specialized for feeding on polychaete worms in the genera Polyodontes (Acoetidae), Loimia (Terebellidae) and Diopatra (Onuphidae).Wells F. E., Walker D. I. & Jones D. S. (eds.) (2003). \\"Food of giants ‚Äì field observations on the diet of Syrinx aruanus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Turbinellidae) the largest living gastropod\\" . The Marine Flora and Fauna of Dampier, Western Australia. Western Australian Museum, Perth. It may seem unlikely for such a large gastropod to feed on worms, but worms in the family Acoetidae do include the largest polychaetes, with a length of over 1 meter. These worms live in tubes; Syrinx aruanus can reach them with its proboscis, which has a length of up to 250 mm.  Human uses  This species is fished both for its very large shell and for its edible flesh, which is sometimes used as bait. The shell is sold for shell collections and is used as a source of lime. Another use of its shell is as a water carrier.Dance S. P. (1992). Shells. Dorling Kindersley. London, New York, Stuttgart. 256 pp., . page 141. Drawing of creating a nose-pin from the shell of Syrinx aruanus. The Aboriginal Australian peoples who live on the Pennefather River in Queensland, use (or used) a half-moon shaped nose-pin known as an imina which is made from the shell of Syrinx aruanus. This nose pin is employed by men only; the women use a piece of grass instead. In order to make one of these nose pins, if the Syrinx shell is fresh, then it can be worked on right away, but if it is dried out, the shell is first soaked for two or three days in water. After this, a portion of the shell which is near the suture and the keel on the body whorl is chipped out using a stone, (see image), and then is ground down with water. The resulting rib-shaped object is used as the nose-pin.

Crown spires first appeared in the Late Gothic church architecture in England and Scotland during the Late Middle Ages, continued to be built through the 17th century and reappeared in the late 18th century as part of the Gothic Revival. Gothic crown spires Crown steeple of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh (1495) The crown steeple on St Nicholas Church, Newcastle upon Tyne was erected in 1448 and is possibly the earliest example of this form of steeple. The crown spire of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh was erected in 1495, and rebuilt by John Mylne in 1648. Another medieval crown steeple was built on the Chapel of King's College, Aberdeen (1500‚Äì1509), although this too was rebuilt in the 17th century, after the original blew down. The crown steeple of the Tolbooth Steeple, in Glasgow's Merchant City, was built in 1626‚Äì1634 by John Boyd, and at the time was the only such steeple in western Scotland. In 1698, Sir Christopher Wren added a tower with a crown steeple to St Dunstan-in-the-East, London. Gothic Revival crown steeples Coats Memorial Baptist Church, Paisley (1885) Crown steeples were often incorporated into Gothic Revival churches. An octagonal bell tower with crown spire was added to St Giles' Church in Pontefract in 1790. The open spire of Faversham Parish Church, Kent was built in 1797, and a crown steeple was added to Tillington Parish Church, Sussex, in 1807. A secular example tops the Wallace Monument, near Stirling, erected in 1869 to a design by the architect John Thomas Rochead. Other ecclesiastical examples include those at Tarbert, Kintyre (1886), and the Kelvin Stevenson Memorial Church, Glasgow, by John James Stevenson (1902).

The sculpture stands proud in the \\"Ranfjord\\" in the city of Mo i Rana, which is often referred to in Norway as \\"Polarsirkelbyen\\" (in English: the \\"Arctic Circle City\\"). The sculpture is tall, weighs , and according to Lonely Planet is \\"forever up to his knees in water, turns his back on the town and gazes resolutely out over the fjord\\". The artist originally envisaged the sculpture being created in steel, based on the traditional steel industry which was one of the pillars of industrial Mo i Rana, and placed in the fjord to illustrate the sharp contrasts between nature and industry. However, the local industry was undergoing major changes at the time, with what was effectively state subsidized and unprofitable factories being closed down, including the local steel works. Realizing the project using local steel therefore became impossible. As a result, Havmann was to become Antony Gormley's first large stone sculpture.) The sculpture was created and erected in the Ranfjord in 1995 as part of Artscape Nordland, causing controversy and much debate in the local media, notably in the local paper Rana Blad, which received hundreds of letters and over 300 poems dedicated to the sculpture. The local debate was ongoing for months, and mainly focused on two issues: whether the commissioning of the sculpture was good use of public money, and maybe less serious, a concern about the newly erected sculpture's lack of an erectable device. Despite the initial debate and controversy, citizens of Mo i Rana today take pride in the sculpture by the internationally renowned artist Antony Gormley and have adopted it as an ambassador for the town. The sculpture has inspired and given name to an annual festival, Havmanndagene (the \\"Havmann days\\") which is held in the city every year in May.

Belvoir Publications. ISSN 0891-1851Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, pages B-9, B-70, B-103 & E-6. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Beaver ultralights have evolved as designs over time, have been produced by several companies and remain in production in the 21st century. Development The first model Beaver was the RX-28, a simple lightweight single-seat aircraft that was intended to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, including the category's maximum empty weight. The model designation indicated that it was Rotax-28 hp as it was powered by the Rotax 277 single-cylinder, two-stroke powerplant. With this engine the RX-28 had an empty weight of . The availability of the Rotax 377 engine lead to a higher-powered version of the RX-28, which was designated the RX-35. This Beaver model was fitted with floats and continued in production by Spectrum Aircraft until they ceased business in 1992. Building on the success of the single-seat Beaver models, Spectrum Aircraft introduced the two-place Beaver RX 550 in 1986 and it quickly became the most popular ultralight trainer in Canada. The combination of its predictable and docile handling, along with the reliable Rotax 503 engine, ensured its success. Intending to improve on the RX 550, Spectrum introduced the Beaver RX 650 in 1991, intending to place it in the Advanced Ultra-light Aeroplane category (AULA) in Canada. The RX 650 has doors that fold upwards, making it ideal for use on floats. The cockpit cage was changed to welded steel tube, from the previously used aluminum and a sprung tailwheel was added. In service the 650 quickly proved to have structural issues and its acceptance in the AULA category was rescinded by Transport Canada until the issues could be rectified. Most customer 650s were kept flying by operating them in the Basic Ultra-light Aeroplane category. Spectrum Aircraft went out of business in 1992, prior to rectifying the issues with the 650. A new company, Beaver RX Enterprises acquired the design and commenced production of the RX 550, placing it in the AULA category. They did not produce the single-seaters or the RX 650. Despite demand for the Beaver, the company soon went out of business. Fun Flight Inc of Alexandria, Virginia, United States also produced the RX550 model in the late 1990s.Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter ‚Äì Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, pages 166 and 168. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. In 1995 Aircraft Sales and Parts (ASAP) of Vernon, British Columbia purchased the Beaver tooling and redesigned the RX 550. The new version, designated the RX 550 Plus incorporated a new wing with a greater number of wing ribs and standard aircraft fabric replacing the Dacron covering. The ASAP RX 550 Plus remains in production and available in kit form. It can be registered in the Canadian Basic and Advanced ultralight categories as well as in the US and Canadian amateur-built aircraft categories. By the end of 2007 a total of 2000 RX 550s had been produced by all manufacturers. In 1996 a new company, Freedom Lite of Walton, Ontario reintroduced the Beaver RX 650, first displaying it at Sun 'n Fun that year. The improved RX 650 incorporated 186 changes over the previous RX 650 design and the company renamed it the Freedom Lite SS-11 Skywatch. The wings use conventional aircraft fabric instead of Dacron, giving build times of about 250 hours. The company placed the aircraft in the Canadian AULA category. Freedom Lite soon went out of business and the design was acquired by Legend Lite of New Hamburg, Ontario. This new company also closed its doors in the early 2000s. In 2000 the manufacturer of RX 550 Plus kits, ASAP, reintroduced a single-seat version of the Beaver, designated the Beaver SS (Single Seat). This is similar to the original RX-28, but powered by a Rotax 447 engine and with a wing derived from the RX 550 Plus design, with additional ribs. The new wing is covered in standard aircraft fabric and incorporates drag tubes in place of the original drag wires. The empty weight has increased somewhat to , putting it above the maximum empty weight for the US FAR 103 category. In Canada it can be flown in the basic ultralight category or amateur-built. By the end of 2007 ten had been completed and flown. Design The Beaver family of aircraft all have similar construction, with the frame fuselage constructed around a single longitudinal 6061-T6 aluminum tube that supports the tail, landing gear and seats. The wings and engine mount are similarly of 6061-T6 aluminum tube and attached to the main tube by connecting struts. The wing features aluminum tube spars and ribs. All Beavers prior to the RX 550 Plus and the SS had pre-sewn Dacron envelopes, which enabled builders to complete the kits in as little as 100 hours. The later models use conventional fabric methods and this makes the factory- claimed build times 150‚Äì200 hours for the SS and 180‚Äì200 hours to the RX 550 Plus. All Beaver wings are swept-back and have elliptical tips. The Plus wing differs from the earlier Beaver wings in that it replaces the internal drag wires with tubes and uses many more ribs to maintain a better airfoil shape, at the cost of additional weight and complexity. The SS and RX 550 Plus wings have 3/4 span ailerons. All models have conventional three-axis controls. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration. Earlier models did not have a steerable nosewheel, but the SS and RX 550 Plus include this feature. Most models have independent mechanical or hydraulic brakes. The cockpit pod enclosure is made of fiberglass and incorporates a windshield. Operational history The Beaver has proven very popular in service, both with flight schools and private owners, due to its ruggedness and pleasant handling characteristics. ASAP owner Brent Holomis says that \\"The RX-550 is often used as a trainer because it's so easy to fly.\\" The early single seat RX-28 suffered from a problem of main tube cracking in operational service, due to the close proximity of the muffler heating the tube. This was later resolved by relocating the muffler.

It is located on Hockamock Head, at the entrance to Burnt Coat Harbor and at the end of Harbor Road. Hockamock Head is a peninsula extending south from the center of the island, dividing the island's main harbor from Toothacker Bay. The light marks the entrance to Burnt Coat Harbor. It was built in 1872, and is a well-preserved 19th-century light station. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The light station consists of the main tower and three buildings: a keeper's house, bell house, and oil house, set on at the southernmost tip of Hockamock Point. The tower is a square brick structure in height, with a ten-sided lantern chamber surrounded by an iron walkway with railing. It is capped by a round ventilator. The keeper's house is an L-shaped wood frame structure, finished in white clapboards. Just to the south of the tower stands the small clapboard bell house, a roughly square structure (it is slightly tapered), with a gable roof and doorway at one end. The oil house is a small brick structure with a doorway at one gabled end, and a small ventilator on the roof. The station was authorized in 1871, and the tower and keeper's house were completed the following year. The station originally had a second range light, placed at the site of the bell house, with a covered way connecting the two towers. That tower and the covered way were removed in 1884. The bell house was built in 1911, and the oil house in 1895. The station was automated in 1975. The keeper's house is now maintained by the Town of Swan's Island, with financial assistance from Friends of the Swan's Island Lighthouse. The keeper's house is open in the summer with a historical exhibit and a small art gallery. The tower is also open for climbing several days per week.

(), (June 4, 1761 ‚Äì July 12, 1841) was a French- born prelate of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. He served as bishop of the Diocese of Bardstown in Kentucky from 1832-33. Biography David was born in Cou√´ron, in the Province of Brittany (now the Department of Loire-Atlantique) in pre-revolutionary France. At age 7 he was placed under the care of his uncle, a priest, who instructed the boy in Latin, French, and music. He entered the nearby college of the Oratorians at age 14, and later the seminary of the Diocese of Nantes, receiving the tonsure in 1778. Ordained a priest on September 24, 1785, he joined the Society of Saint-Sulpice (commonly known as the Sulpicians) and taught philosophy, theology, and Scripture at the Sulpician seminary in Angers from 1786 until 1790, when the French Revolution forced him to seek shelter in the private home of a Catholic family. In January 1792, seeking safety, David was part of a small group of Sulpicians who left France for the United States, under the leadership of the Abb√© Benedict Joseph Flaget, S.S., landing in Baltimore, Maryland in March. He was first sent by Bp. John Carroll to serve the Catholics of southern Maryland in Bryantown and missions in Charles County.\\"David, John Baptist Mary\\", New Catholic Encyclopedia While professor of philosophy at Georgetown College (1804‚Äì06), he continued to serve as a missionary to southern Maryland. He was the professor of theology at St. Mary's Seminary (1806‚Äì10) in Baltimore, where he was also acting president during 1810-11. In 1810 he moved west to serve under his colleague, Flaget, now the bishop of the Diocese of Bardstown, Kentucky, where he established St. Thomas Seminary. In 1812 he founded the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, whose Superior General he remained almost to the end of his life. On July 4, 1817, David was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Bardstown and Titular Bishop of Maurocastrum by Pope Pius VII. He received his episcopal consecration on August 15, 1819 (the two-year-long delay due to his reluctance to accept his nomination) from Bishop Flaget. Following his consecration, he continued to serve as a missionary, superior of St. Thomas' Seminary, and pastor of St. Joseph's Cathedral. David succeeded Flaget as the second Bishop of Bardstown on August 25, 1832. However, he resigned as Bishop less than a year later, on March 17, 1833. His poor health compelled him to retire to the motherhouse of the Sisters of Charity he had founded in Nazareth, where he later died at age 80 and was buried.Shook, John R., \\"John David\\", Dictionary of Early American Philosophers, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2012 References Episcopal succession Category:1761 births Category:1841 deaths Category:People from Cou√´ron Category:Sulpicians Category:Breton Roman Catholic priests Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Sulpician bishops Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:Catholic Church in Maryland Category:Catholic Church in Kentucky Category:Burials in Kentucky Category:Religious leaders from Kentucky Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in the United States ","title":"John Baptist Mary David"},{"id":"23880307","title":"List of tallest buildings in Bucharest"},{"id":"23880308","text":"Anne of Ostfriesland (Aurich, June 26, 1562 - Neuhaus upon Elbe, April 21, 1621) was the eldest daughter of Edzard II, Count of East Frisia and his wife, Katarina Vasa, daughter of Gustav I of Sweden.

King's illustrated publications about Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and elsewhere in the U.S. received generally positive reviews. King published a few handbooks in the Boston area that were written by Moses Foster Sweetser (1848-1897), such as the King's Handbook of the Boston Harbor. M. F. Sweetser was an author and a manuscript writer of many works. The more popular titles of King's publications returned in updated editions. One darker chapter in King's career occurred in June 1893. During a business meeting in New York, King and photographer Arthur G. Massey engaged in an altercation resulting in Massey filing a lawsuit alleging that King had pulled out part of Massey's beard.

History While some logging took place in the middle of the 19th century, real impetus to its development was due to the economic crisis of the 1930s, when government authorities encouraged resettlement of the unemployed by opening the area for agriculture. In 1932, Saint-Marc-de-Latour was formed with the construction of a sawmill. In 1935, the Parish of Sainte-Th√©r√®se-des-Colombiers was formed. Also that year, pioneers set up 20 camps and built the road along the Saint Lawrence River. In 1937, the post office opened, then designated as Rivi√®re-Colombier, named after the Colombier River, a tributary of the St. Lawrence that flows through the municipality. In 1946, the Municipality of Colombier was formed, named after the river, which in turn was named after Charles-Roger des Colombiers (1628-1687), fur trader, citizen and alderman of Quebec, who had been granted a fief in that territory in 1677.

The islets are southeast and in sight of Cape Island, that is just off the southern tip of Cape Newagen on Southport Island, south of Booth Bay, that leads to Boothbay Harbor, Maine. The fog station was first established as a daymark on November 16, 1892, for marking the islets and Collector ledge replacing a 57-foot-tall wooden tripod, In 1893 a bell was installed and a light was added in 1907. The keepers house was demolished following the 1974 decommission but was rebuilt from 2010 to 2014, along with the wharf, and the lighthouse restored. The Cuckolds Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Lincoln County, Maine as Cuckolds Light Station on December 2, 2002. History The United States Congress appropriated funding through the Lighthouse commission and authorized the building of the lighthouse August 30, 1890, but the $25,000 funding was not provided until March 3, 1891. The station commenced operation in 1892 with duplicated four horsepower coal-fired engines, compressors, and tanks, along with hot air first-order Daboll trumpets. Material for construction included 105 yards of granite, 60,000 bricks, 430 casks of cement, 100 tons of sand, 200 tons of broken stone and pebbles, 70,000 feet of lumber, and included 3,400 pounds of wrought-iron work. The granite was used for the foundation and the lighthouse was attached to this for stability. A radio transmitter was installed in 1956. =Light= In 1907 a Fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. The early coal fired system used approximately seven tons of coal to run around 1000 hours and when converted to oil ran 423 hours on 195 gallons of oil. The original 24,000 candlepower, provided by an incandescent oil vapor lamp, was increased to 30,000 candlepower powered by an electric lamp and the fourth-order lens, and by 1971 to 500,000 candlepower. = Deactivation and transfer= The lighthouse was decommissioned in 1974 and listed as United States Coast Guard surplus property. The non-profit Cuckolds Island Fog Signal and Light Station Council was formed and submitted a 542-page proposal that was accepted and the deed transferred on May 8, 2006. =Current= In June 2014 the Inn at Cuckolds Lighthouse opened, being rebuilt as well as the lighthouse restored, and is advertised as a luxurious retreat providing \\"pampered luxury\\" for upward of $3000 a weekend. Tours will be held and transportation to the island will be provided in a restored United States Navy whaleboat. The Fresnel lens, removed when the light was decommissioned, is housed at the Maine Lighthouse Museum in Rockland. The lighthouse is currently equipped with a VRB-25 and remains an active aid to navigation, maintained by the Coast Guard.

In the Talmud, the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God.Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:1Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:1 According to the prophet Malachi, God makes the analogy himself: Judaism The commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for man owes his existence to his father and his mother. The Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God.Talmud Kiddushin 31 It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated: Because honouring parents is part of honouring God, the mitzvah does not depend on the worthiness of the parent: \\"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father.\\" (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25) It also requires honour to one's stepparentsMishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:17Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:19 or an older sibling who is raising one,Plaut, W.

Jason Aronson. view on Google Books The commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.Exodus 21:11; Deuteronomy 5:16; Leviticus 19:3; =Historical beliefs= Keeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. According to the Torah, striking or cursing one's father or mother was punishable by immediate death. In Deuteronomy, a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.Deuteronomy 21:18‚Äì21. Note that the reference to the son being a drunkard would suggest that he is not a small child. Honouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God.Commentary on Exodus 20:12, The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation According to the prophet Jeremiah, God refers to himself as Father to Israel,Jeremiah 31:9 and according to the prophet Isaiah, God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters.Isaiah 43:6 According to the prophet Malachi, God calls for similar honour.Malachi 1:6 (NIV) According to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of RechabThis family is first introduced in 2 Kings 10:15‚Äì31 for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods: =Precedence= According to the Mishneh Torah this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:2Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:14 While Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents: =Requirements= The commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey. Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a law of the Torah, he/she must refuse to obey. A child is not required to obey if a parent says that he/she must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person he/she wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.Isaacs, The Jewish Book of Etiquette (p. 132)Donin, Hayim Halevy.

This can be done by reciting kaddish for 11 months and on the yarzeit (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child. A child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent. A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother. A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.The Little Midrash Says, Volume III, The Book of Vayikra, by M. Weissman, C 1988, page 165 New Testament Ruth honoured her widowed mother- in-law Naomi. Simeon Solomon, 1860. In the gospels, Jesus affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1‚Äì9, Matthew 19:17‚Äì19, Mark 10:17‚Äì19, Luke 18:18‚Äì21) Paul quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in Ephesus: In his letters to the Romans and Timothy, Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29‚Äì31, 2 Timothy 3:2). The words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3‚Äì8, Mark 7:9‚Äì12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted. According to the gospel of Matthew, the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: \\"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.\\" (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does not include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12‚Äì17 read online (accessed 31 August 2009)NIV Study Bible. 1999. Zondervan. Note on Colossians 3:20 with reference to Acts 5:29 Paul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following: Christian =Catholicism= The import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role: According to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity ‚Äì first God, then parents, then others. Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society. The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society: The Gospel of Luke notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching. \\"Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'\\" (Proverbs 6:20‚Äì22) The Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing \\"material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress\\". This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure. The principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers. The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as \\"a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'.\\" Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father. =Orthodox Church= Father Seraphim Stephens sees \\"Honor\\" defined as \\"Love and Respect\\", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. \\"It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people.\\" Richard D. Andrews points out that, \\"Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents.\\"Andrews, Richard Demetrius. \\"Honor thy Father and Mother\\", Orthodoxy Today, June 2, 2007 =Protestantism= John Calvin describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion \\"absurd\\".Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III, Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 read online The commentary of John Wesley on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1‚Äì3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents.Wesley, John. Notes on the Bible: Notes on the Second Book of Moses, commentary on Exodus 20:12 read onlinesee also Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20:12 read online Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, \\"Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?\\" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.Galatians 6:6 and 1 Timothy 5:17‚Äì18 Matthew Henry explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of Esther honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai: Esther and Mordecai writing the second letter of Purim. Arent de Gelder, ca. 1685. Oil on canvas, RISD Museum of Art, Providence RI The commandment itself encourages obedience \\"so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you\\".Deuteronomy 5:16 Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual. In his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death.Exodus 21:15,17 and Leviticus 20:9 Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate.Deuteronomy 21:18‚Äì21 Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 21:15, 17 and Leviticus 20:9 read online Although Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose. As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother,Proverbs 6:20‚Äì22 and Paul specified that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, \\"which is pleasing to God\\".1 Timothy 5:4 Just as \\"honor\\" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance.\\"Honor your father and mother\\", The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention Respect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul's life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king. Rewards for compliance This commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: \\"...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.\\"Plaut and Stein,The Torah: A Modern Commentary(p. 504) Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: \\"...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.\\" Kioulachoglou, Anastasios. \\"Honor your father and mother\\", Journal of Bible Accuracy Consequences of disobedience As with most terms of the covenant between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience: See also * Biblical law in Christianity * Filial piety * Pietas References Further reading * U.S. Catholic Church.

Established in 1855, it is one of the only separately managed fog signals in the United States, having been operationally independent of Monhegan Island Light for most of its existence. It is also home to the only known fog signal trumpet tower, built in 1889. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Manana Island Fog Signal Station in 2002. Description Monhegan is a small island community off the coast of Maine, consisting of Monhegan Island, and a number of nearby smaller islands. Its harbor is situated in the channel between Monhegan and Manana Islands, just west of the main island. The Manana Island Sound Signal Station is located at the highest point on Manana Island, and consists of several buildings and structures. The present signal equipment is housed in small brick building, built in 1906 on the foundation of the original signal house, originally for use as an oil house. The former main signal building is a brick structure about , built in 1889 on the site of an earlier wood frame structure. It is topped by a low tower that was originally used to house a Daboll trumpet. A shed covering several iron pressure tanks is attached to one side. The keeper's house, dating to 1855, is a much-altered 1-1/2 story wood frame building. The station is served by an electromechanical hoist, to facilitate the movement of materials to the site. It consists of a set of rails, which extend from the boat landing on the island's east side to a hoist house, housing the motor, near the other buildings. This facility was built in 1905, and is maintained for use. History Monhegan Island has long been an important marine navigation landmark on the coast of Maine. Because it is frequently beset by fog, the United States Lighthouse Board proposed in 1853 the construction of a fog signal for Manana Island. Congress appropriated funds for the station in 1854, and in 1855 a manually sounded bell was installed on Manana Island, about one mile west of Monhegan Island Light. In 1856 an automatic striking machine was installed. After further funding was secured, a steam-powered Daboll trumpet, then an experimental device, was installed in 1870. It was replaced in 1872 by a whistle, and the trumpet was moved to the Portland Head Light. Originally administratively part of Monhegan Island Light, the fog signal was placed under separate administration in 1876. In 1877 a new Daboll trumpet was installed. It was replaced in 1912 by an air siren, and in 1937 a radio beacon was added to the site. The station was automated in 1986, and the radio tower was removed in 1995.

That's no different from an American company saying > you have to rub two sticks together to get the production on because our NEA > budget got cut this year. In the June 2012 issue of the British magazine Opera which examined recent repertoire trends which reveal a move towards the rare and unusual, Strassberger makes the following observation regarding the staging of some of them: > I love these works and they give me the freedom to turn up as a director and > put them on stage without having to un-engineer what people thought they > were going to be.

A dentist, lawyer, and former real estate agent,http://politifact.com/personalities/orly-taitz/CA Department of Real Estate license records Taitz was a figure in the \\"birther\\" movement, which promoted the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen eligible to serve as president of the United States. Taitz also promotes other conspiracy theories both related and unrelated to Obama. Taitz has initiated lawsuits on behalf of the \\"birther\\" movement; all were dismissed by the courts, and on one occasion Taitz was ordered to pay $20,000 as a sanction for misconduct in filing frivolous claims. Taitz has unsuccessfully run for statewide office in California three times. Early life and immigration Taitz was born to a Jewish family in Chi»ôinƒÉu, Moldavian SSR, in the Soviet Union (present-day Moldova). Both of her parents were science teachers. In 1981, Taitz immigrated to Israel, where she obtained a dentistry degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1987, she met Yosef Taitz who proposed four months later. Taitz immigrated to the United States in May 1987, marrying the Latvian-born Yosef in Las Vegas. Taitz became a naturalized United States citizen in 1992. She received her law degree from Taft Law School and was admitted to practice law in California in December 2002. Taitz lives in Laguna Niguel, California, and owns dental practices in nearby Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita. She has three sons, holds a second degree black belt in Taekwondo, and speaks five languages: English, Hebrew, Romanian (also known as Moldovan in her homeland and are sometimes considered different languages for political reasons), Russian and Spanish. Before her national news exposure, Taitz was quoted in The Orange County Register in 2006 supporting Israeli military actions against Hamas and Hezbollah, and downplaying the impact of the espionage trial of two American Israel Public Affairs Committee staffers. (Charges against both were subsequently dropped.) Taitz has also said that she lost relatives in the Holocaust and that her grandmother witnessed the Kishinev pogrom. Activities =Taitz's claims regarding President Obama = Taitz claimed that U.S. president Obama was not a natural-born citizen of the United States and was therefore ineligible to serve as President. She claimed he was born in Kenya and that he falsified his Selective Service papers and his application to the Illinois bar. Taitz made other claims against Obama, including: *That a number of homosexuals from Obama's former church have died mysteriously. *That Obama had dozens of Social Security numbers, and his passport was inaccurate. Taitz claimed that a person who was cooperating with the FBI in connection with Obama's passport died mysteriously, \\"shot in the head\\". *That a Kenyan birth certificate with the name \\"Barack Obama\\" is authentic. *That Obama's first act as president was to donate money to Hamas, which she claims will be used to build Qassam rockets. *That Obama, or someone connected to him, has made threats to Taitz's life and vandalized her car. *That FEMA camps conspiracy theory: Obama is having the Federal Emergency Management Agency build internment camps for \\"Anti-Obama dissidents\\". *That Osama bin Laden was killed years before 2011 when he actually died, with his body kept on ice, and the announcement of his death was timed to divert attention from an upcoming court case she was litigating challenging Obama's citizenship. *Claims about the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories: Taitz blamed Obama for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, writing on her website: \\"Was Adam Lanza drugged and hypnotised by his handlers to make him into a killing machine as an excuse as the regime is itching to take all means of self defense from the populace before the economic collapse?\\" =Taitz's other claims= Taitz has also supported a number of other theories not directly related to President Obama, including: *Goldman Sachs runs the United States Treasury. *Baxter International has developed a bird flu vaccine that kills people. *Representative Alcee Hastings and the House of Representatives are planning to build at least six labor camps. *Hugo Ch√°vez owns the software that runs American voting machines. *FactCheck is untrustworthy because of its links to the Annenberg Foundation. Taitz has also advocated numerous Internet-related theories, including PayPal attacks, the deletion of her Wikipedia entry, and Google's flagging her webpage as an attack site and suppressing search results for her name. Taitz has stated that 2016 Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Bobby Jindal were not natural-born citizens and therefore were ineligible for the office they sought. =Legal actions= Challenges to and during Obama's first presidential term =Keyes v. Bowen= In November 2008, Taitz filed a lawsuit on behalf of independent presidential candidate Alan Keyes, suing California's secretary of state, Debra Bowen, for allegedly failing to ascertain Obama's eligibility for president before placing him on the ballot. The case was dismissed on May 4, 2009. The U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment to review the case on October 3, 2011. =Lightfoot v. Bowen= Taitz filed an emergency petition in the California Supreme Court in 2008 on behalf of Libertarian vice presidential candidate Gail Lightfoot to stop the certification of California's 2008 election results because of the challenge to Obama's eligibility. The California Supreme Court denied the petition, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. =Barnett v. Obama= Taitz filed a lawsuit on behalf of Pamela Barnett, Alan Keyes, other candidates in the 2008 federal elections, several military personnel, and some legislators from various states alleging that Obama was ineligible to be president. On October 29, 2009, U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter dismissed the lawsuit. The dismissal criticized Taitz's legal abilities, stated her behavior was \\"unethical\\", and suggested that Taitz \\"may have suborned perjury\\". On December 22, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal. On June 11, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined, without comment, a request by litigants not represented by Taitz to hear the case. =Cook v. Good= Taitz represented Stefan F. Cook, a major in the United States Army Reserve, who challenged orders implementing his voluntary deployment to Afghanistan because of his claim that Obama was not a legitimate president. The case was dismissed when the Army Reserve revoked his order to deploy. Taitz filed an appeal in the Eleventh Circuit, which was dismissed on November 24, 2009, due to a failure to prosecute the appeal. =Rhodes v. MacDonald= In September 2009, Taitz was retained by Captain Connie Rhodes, a U.S. Army physician. Rhodes sought a restraining order to prevent her forthcoming deployment to Iraq. In the request for a restraining order, Taitz argued the deployment order was illegal since Obama was illegally serving as president. On September 16, federal judge Clay D. Land rejected the motion and denounced it as frivolous. In his opinion, the judge noted that Rhodes had not previously raised any objections to orders she had received from Obama since he had been sworn in. He noted that while she seemed to have \\"conscientious objections\\" to taking orders from Obama, she did not seem to object to serving under him \\"as long as she is permitted to remain on American soil\\". Land then upbraided Taitz for using military officers as pawns to further her claims that Obama was not qualified to be president. He also expressed astonishment at Taitz's apparent misunderstanding of American judicial fundamentals, saying that she was trying to make Obama prove his innocence' to 'charges' that are based upon conjecture and speculation\\".Rhodes vs. MacDonald CASE NO. 4:09-CV-106, Middle District of Georgia(CDL) Within hours of Land's decision, Taitz told the news site Talking Points Memo that she felt Land's refusal to hear her case was an act of treason. Two days later, she filed a motion to stay Rhodes' deployment pending rehearing of the dismissal order. She repeated her treason allegations against Land and made several other intemperate statements, including claims that Land was aiding and abetting purported aspirations of \\"dictatorship\\" by Obama.Motion for stay of Connie Rhodes' deployment Land rejected the motion as frivolous and ordered her to show cause why she should not be fined $10,000 for abuse of judicial process. A few hours later, a letter bearing Rhodes's signature arrived, stating that Taitz filed the motion without her knowledge or consent, asking Land to remove Taitz as her attorney of record in the case, and stating that it was her \\"plan to file a complaint with the California State Bar due to [Taitz's] reprehensible and unprofessional actions\\". On September 26, 2009, Taitz filed a motion with the court seeking to withdraw as counsel for Rhodes, so she could divulge in court \\"privileged attorney-client communications\\" since the dismissed Rhodes case \\"is now a quasi-criminal prosecution of the undersigned attorney, for the purpose of punishment\\". Attorney misconduct On October 13, 2009, Judge Clay Land ordered \\"Counsel Orly Taitz ... to pay $20,000 to the United States, through the Middle District of Georgia Clerk's Office, within thirty days of the date of this Order as a sanction for her misconduct in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\" Land's decision stated: > The Court finds that counsel's conduct was willful and not merely negligent. > It demonstrates bad faith on her part. As an attorney, she is deemed to have > known better. She owed a duty to follow the rules and to respect the Court. > Counsel's pattern of conduct conclusively establishes that she did not > mistakenly violate a provision of law. She knowingly violated Rule 11. Her > response to the Court's show cause order is breathtaking in its arrogance > and borders on delusional. She expresses no contrition or regret regarding > her misconduct. To the contrary, she continues her baseless attacks on the > Court. Upon learning of Land's ruling, Taitz said she would appeal the sanction, declaring that Judge Land was \\"scared to go against the regime\\" of the \\"oppressive\\" Obama administration, and that the sanction was an attempt to \\"intimidate\\" her. On March 15, 2010, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the sanctions against Taitz, ordering her to pay the $20,000 fine. In July 2010, Taitz applied to the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the enforcement of sanctions, arguing that \\"allowing sanctions by judge Land to stand will signify beginning of tyranny in the United States of America and end to the Constitutional Republic which is the foundation of this nation\\". On July 8, the application was submitted to Associate Justice Clarence Thomas; on July 15, he denied it. Doubting that Justice Thomas signed the denial order, Taitz claimed to have requested of Chief Justice John Roberts that Thomas's signature be presented to her for verification. In the meantime, on August 9, the federal government filed an abstract of judgment, a document placing a lien in the amount of $20,000 plus interest on all her real property, prompting Taitz to say, \\"I will pay the money, and I will continue fighting,\\" should it happen that her application for stay is ultimately denied and that the Supreme Court consents to her request to authenticate Justice Thomas's signature. On August 16, after being resubmitted to Associate Justice Samuel Alito, who in turn referred it to the full court, the application for stay was again denied. On January 10, 2011, the Court declined, without comment, to hear the case. =Taitz v. Obama= On January 27, 2010, Taitz, in propria persona, filed a petition for writ of quo warranto. On April 14, 2010, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth dismissed the petition, stating that \\"the Court is not willing to go tilting at windmills with her.\\" =Taitz v. Astrue= In February 2011, Taitz filed, in propria persona, a Freedom of Information Act suit against the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, alleging the agency improperly refused to disclose to her information about Obama's social security number. After Taitz repeatedly failed to follow the court rule regarding the redaction of social security numbers in court filings, Chief Judge Lamberth wrote that Taitz \\"is either toying with the Court or displaying her own stupidity... There is no logical explanation she can provide as to why she is now wasting the Court's time, as well as the staff's time, with these improper redactions.\\" Copy at On August 30, 2011, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the government, writing \\"As her numerous filings with the Court demonstrate, plaintiff will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this alleged conspiracy. Unfortunately for plaintiff, today is not her lucky day.\\" =Taitz v. Fuddy= In August 2011, Taitz filed, in propria persona, a suit against the director of the Hawaii Department of Health, seeking to review Obama's \\"long form\\" birth certificate. On October 12, 2011, the Hawaii Circuit Court dismissed Taitz's suit. =Taitz v. Ruemmler= Taitz sought to compel White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler under FOIA to grant access to Obama's \\"long form\\" birth certificate. On October 17, 2011, Chief Judge Lamberth noted Taitz's \\"Sisyphean quest\\" and dismissed the suit.Memorandum and Order. D.C. District Court. Challenges to and during Obama's second term =2012 New Hampshire primary challenge= In November 2011, Taitz, backed by four New Hampshire state legislators, filed a complaint with the state's Ballot Law Commission challenging Obama's eligibility to compete in the primary election. As Obama had paid the filing fee and his declaration of candidacy conformed to state law, the Commission unanimously voted to keep Obama on the ballot. The Commission then denied a request for reconsideration. In response, Taitz wrote to William L. O'Brien, the Speaker of the House of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and demanded the removal of Bill Gardner, New Hampshire's Secretary of State, for \\"egregious elections fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, forgery and possibly treason.\\" D.J. Bettencourt, House Majority Leader of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, wrote to Taitz and called her actions \\"unbecoming of any legitimate political dialogue, nevermind one as ridiculous as the continued obsession over President Obama's birthplace.\\" Bettencourt added, \\"I have spoken to the Representatives who were present and expressed to them my strong desire that they immediately disassociate themselves from you and this folly.\\" =2012 Georgia primary challenge= Five Georgians, including one represented by Taitz, filed challenges with the Georgia Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, regarding Obama's inclusion on the March primary ballot. Kemp referred the challenges to Deputy Chief Judge Michael Malihi, an administrative law judge, who denied Obama's motion to dismiss them and scheduled a hearing for January 26. On January 23, Malihi denied Obama's motion to quash a subpoena issued by Taitz to compel Obama to appear, saying that Obama did not show why he should not be at the hearing or how his testimony would not be helpful. On January 25, Obama's attorney requested that Kemp halt the proceedings, and indicated that Obama would no longer participate in the litigation pending Kemp's decision. Kemp denied their request and warned that their non-participation would be \\"at your own peril\\". Neither Obama nor his attorney appeared at the January 26 hearing. This normally would result in a default order, but the challengers requested Malihi to allow them to go ahead with the hearing and rule on \\"the merits of their arguments and evidence\\". Taitz called eight witnesses (including herself), and presented seven exhibits in support of her claims that Obama was not a natural-born citizen, has used multiple names, has multiple Social Security numbers, and used a fake birth certificate. Taitz asked Malihi to fine Obama in contempt for failing to appear. On February 3, Malihi recommended that Obama remain on the ballot. Concerning Taitz's case Malihi wrote: \\"The Court finds the testimony of the witnesses, as well as the exhibits tendered, to be of little, if any, probative value, and thus wholly insufficient to support plaintiffs‚Äô allegations\\". The Drudge Retort described the hearing as \\"Empty Table 1, Orly Taitz 0\\". On February 6, Kemp accepted Malihi's recommendation. On February 13, Taitz filed for review,\\"Docket\\". Farrar v. Obama. February 13, 2012. but on February 15 her application to appear pro hac vice was denied \\"at this time\\". =2012 Alabama primary challenge= A lawsuit filed by an Alabama citizen, Albert Hendershot, in December 2011 alleged Obama's birth certificate was forged and that he was ineligible to be on the Alabama primary ballot. Taitz agreed to represent Hendershot and sought to enter the case, but it was dismissed before she could make an appearance. =2012 Indiana primary challenge= On February 24, Taitz appeared as a witness on the behalf of two residents of Indiana who had filed with the Indiana Election Commission a challenge to Obama's eligibility. The challengers demanded a default judgment against Obama, as neither he nor a representative appeared at the hearing; this motion was unanimously denied by the commission. Taitz made false claims, arguing that the President's surname was not Obama, that he was not a natural-born citizen, and that he was using a stolen Social Security number. When Taitz accused the commission of a cover- up, Dan Dumezich, the ScherervilleDaniel Dumezich's Biography Vote Smart. Retrieved 16 August 2020. Republican who is chairman of the commission, told her that if she was disrespectful one more time, \\"your butt is going to be gone.\\" The challenge was denied. =2012 Mississippi primary challenge= In February 2012, Taitz sued the Mississippi state Democratic Party and the Mississippi Secretary of State alleging Obama was not a natural born citizen. Taitz accused the party of aiding and abetting in forgery and fraud when it submitted to the court a copy of Obama's birth certificate. In response, the party filed with the court a certified verification from Hawaii's State Registrar attesting to the accuracy of Obama's birth certificate. Taitz accused the registrar of being complicit with the forgery. =2012 Indiana general election challenge= Taitz filed a lawsuit in Indiana, and attempted to subpoena Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and one of his assistants, Mike Zullo, to compel them to testify about the results of their investigation into Obama's birth certificate. Zullo indicated the two did not intend to attend the trial, stating, \\"We don't want our information tainted by a circus show\\". =2012 Kansas general election challenge= In September 2012, Taitz attempted to address a Kansas state board that had been reviewing a challenge to Obama's placement on the ballot, but her request to speak was denied. After the hearing was over, Taitz and an Obama supporter argued, and eventually both were escorted out of the building by a police officer. Taitz claimed that during the post-hearing confrontation she was threatened by African-American men behaving like \\"animals\\" and \\"thugs\\"; two Topeka community leaders who were present labeled Taitz's remarks as \\"inaccurate\\" and \\"racist\\". On September 20, Taitz filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to stay the board's actions. On November 2, 2012, the court dismissed Taitz's suit due to her lack of standing. =2012 Mississippi general election challenge= In a lawsuit initiated by Taitz, she falsely claimed Obama's birth certificate and Social Security Number were fake, and sought to disqualify him from the ballot. =Grinols v. Obama= On December 13, 2012, Taitz filed in Sacramento, California a lawsuit on behalf of James Grinols (a Republican elector from Minnesota), Robert Odden (a Libertarian elector from Minnesota), Keith Russell Judd (a federal prisoner who was on the West Virginia Democratic primary ballot), Edward Noonan (who won the American Independent Party presidential primary in California), and Thomas MacLeran (who filed to run as a Republican for president) seeking to prevent Congress from certifying the Electoral College's vote. The lawsuit also sought to prevent California officials from certifying the election results from the 2012 presidential election. On January 3, 2013, District Judge Morrison C. England Jr. denied the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to prevent Congress from certifying the Electoral College's vote. At the hearing, the judge told Taitz, \\"Your argument, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever,\\" and at one point asked, \\"Why do you keep filing these lawsuits when they keep getting rejected?\\" In April 2013, the court dismissed the suit. In November 2015, the 9th Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal. =Taitz v. Hawaiian Memorial Park Mortuary= Believing that the death of Loretta Fuddy (the director of the Hawaii Department of Health) was not an accident, Taitz sued the Hawaiian Memorial Park Mortuary in Federal district court on December 20, 2013, to prevent a cremation. Taitz withdrew her petition on January 9, 2014 and the suit was dismissed the following day.Taitz v. Hawaiian Memorial Park Mortuary, case no. 13-cv-00708-SOM-KSC, U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. Legal actions not related to Obama's eligibility In June 2012, Taitz was retained by a medical marijuana activist who had been arrested while attempting to gather signatures for a ballot initiative. In December 2013, in response to A&E; suspending Phil Robertson, Taitz filed an administrative complaint in Colorado that accused A&E; was \\"engaged in discrimination against heterosexuals in favor of homosexuals, engaged in discrimination of religious people, particularly Christians, in favor of godless atheists\\". In May 2014, in response to the National Basketball Association banning Donald Sterling for making racist remarks, Taitz filed a \\"complaint\\" with the NBA, requesting that it also ban Shaquille O'Neal because he, in Taitz's opinion, \\"publicly bullied\\" a disabled person. In July 2014, Taitz filed a lawsuit challenging the transfer of undocumented immigrants from South Texas to other states, claiming they would spread communicable diseases. The U.S. government opposed Taitz's lawsuit, arguing she lacked standing and was trying to \\"entangle the judiciary in her political quarrels.\\" At a hearing held on August 27, 2014, the court denied Taitz's request for a temporary restraining order, but permitted her to amend her lawsuit. In her amended complaint, in addition to her claims about communicable diseases, Taitz claimed that unknown parties pressured a border patrol agent to not testify on her behalf; she also claimed the NSA and FBI have placed agents in the federal courts to tamper with documents. In July 2015, the court dismissed almost of all Taitz's lawsuit, ruling she lacked standing to challenge the federal government's immigration practices. In December 2014, Taitz filed a second lawsuit in Texas, alleging the Centers for Disease Control failed to provide her with information she requested about Ebola and other communicable diseases in the United States. Because the information Taitz sought was not in Texas, the court transferred the case to a court in Southern California, where Taitz resides. In March 2015, Taitz filed a third lawsuit in Texas, alleging the federal government's grant of asylum and refuge status encouraged undocumented immigrants to engage in identity theft. She also alleged Obama was using a stolen Social Security number, forged identification documents, and a false name. Taitz's attempt to join this lawsuit with the first suit that she filed in Texas failed. =Political campaigns= California Secretary of State, 2010 Republican primary In March 2010, Taitz qualified to run for the office of California Secretary of State. At the same time, she unsuccessfully challenged the eligibility of her Republican Party primary opponent, former NFL player Damon Dunn, claiming that he was pretending to be a Republican. Dunn had registered as a Democrat in the state of Florida in 1999, but that registration had lapsed before he filed for the Republican primary. On May 12, 2010, Pamela Barnett (named plaintiff from Taitz's lawsuit Barnett v. Obama) filed a lawsuit in the Sacramento County Superior Court alleging that Dunn was not eligible to run for Secretary of State. Taitz was defeated by Dunn in the June 8 primary by a margin of about three to one, losing by over 900,000 votes.California Secretary of State's website. Retrieved June 21, 2010. On June 17, 2010, Taitz filed a lawsuit in the Orange County Superior Court contesting the election results, again alleging Dunn's ineligibility. On March 17, 2011, the judge ruled against Taitz. On May 1, 2012, a California Court of Appeal affirmed the superior court's ruling. U.S. Senator from California, 2012 blanket primary Taitz attempted to challenge U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein in the 2012 blanket primary, stating, \\"I think I do have a chance specifically because I do speak Spanish and I speak Hebrew.\\" In November 2011, Taitz trailed Feinstein by a nearly 2‚Äì1 margin. A Feinstein advisor stated, \\"If this race plays out as a bunch of unknowns who have no serious funding, Orly Taitz will probably win the primary [along with Feinstein].\\" (In 2012, California used a blanket primary campaign system for offices other than U.S. President, so that the top two finishers in the primary regardless of party affiliation go on to the ballot in the fall general election.)Primary Elections in California http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/voter-info/primary-elections.htm A March 2012 poll by another Republican candidate had Taitz leading the Republican field; 38% of those polled had not decided whom to vote for. On March 11, the California Republican Party endorsed another candidate, Elizabeth Emken, over Taitz. Citing fears the election might be \\"rigged\\", Taitz announced her intention to work with Sharron Angle to ensure \\"a fair and honest election\\". On June 5, 2012, Emken came in second to Feinstein in the primary with about 12% of the vote and advanced to the general election; Taitz came in fifth with 3.1%. In July 2012, Taitz sued to block the certification of the primary election results, alleging \\"rampant election fraud\\"; she also alleged Obama engaged in \\"identity fraud.\\" Her suit was denied. In October 2012, Taitz tried to revive her election lawsuit by asking the court to compel Occidental College to produce student records for President Obama, who attended Occidental from 1979 to 1981. The judge ruled that Taitz's motion did not meet basic legal requirements and ordered her to pay $4,000 in sanctions to Occidental's lawyer for the cost of opposing the motion. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal and sanctions. California Attorney General, 2014 blanket primary Taitz filed paperwork indicating her intent to become the California Attorney General in the 2014 blanket primary. Taitz was endorsed by David Manning. Judson Phillips, leader of the Tea Party Nation, accused Taitz of falsely implying that the organization had endorsed her when it had not. Taitz came in sixth (out of seven candidates) in the primary, with approximately 3.1% of the vote. =Activities in Israel= Taitz has also actively promoted her conspiracy theories in Israel, where she falsely claims that \\"the vast majority\\" of the population supports her views. She has appeared on the Channel 10 nightly news show London and Kirschenbaum, was the subject of a feature on Channel 1 TV, and filmed a video for the website Arutz 7. Israel's Russian-language media, such as Channel 9 and Vesti, the country's largest Russian-language newspaper, have also covered Taitz. In the media Taitz received media attention in connection with President Obama eligibility questions in late 2008. She was interviewed by co-hosts David Shuster and Tamron Hall on MSNBC on August 3, 2009. Various media outlets described her appearance on the network as an \\"implosion\\", while Taitz asserted that Shuster, who is Jewish, was a \\"brownshirt\\", a charge she would repeat in a phone interview the following week. Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly called Taitz a \\"nut\\". In response, she and pastor James David Manning organized a protest outside Fox News headquarters in New York City in November 2009, which drew an estimated 15 to 20 attendees. In April 2011, Lawrence O'Donnell invited Taitz on MSNBC so that she could address President Obama's long form birth certificate, which had been released the day before. When Taitz only wanted to make false claims about President Obama's alleged Selective Service papers and refused to comment on his birth certificate, O'Donnell kicked her off the show, stating: \\"Look, she's crazy. I invited a crazy person on this show to see if the crazy person ... could say something responsive, something human, to the document that was released today ... and she wants to play with all of her other kids' toys.\\" See also * Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories References External links * Official web site * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American dentists Category:American women lawyers Category:American people of Moldovan-Jewish descent Category:California lawyers Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Israeli emigrants to the United States Category:People from Chi»ôinƒÉu Category:People from Laguna Niguel, California Category:Soviet emigrants to Israel Category:Women dentists Category:Women in California politics Category:American real estate brokers Category:California Republicans Category:Activists from California Category:American people of Israeli descent Category:Israeli people of Moldovan-Jewish descent ","title":"Orly Taitz"},{"id":"23880673","text":"Jon Manasse is an American clarinetist.

Dutch troops are standing on the left. The Dutch intervention in Bali in 1906 was a Dutch military intervention in Bali as part of the Dutch colonial suppression, killing over 1,000 people, most of whom were civilians. It was part of the Dutch campaign for the suppression of most of the Netherlands East-Indies. The campaign killed the Balinese rulers of Badung and their wives and children, as well as destroying the southern Bali kingdoms of Badung and Tabanan and weakening the kingdom of Klungkung. It was the sixth Dutch military intervention in Bali. Context The Netherlands had already conquered northern Bali by the middle of the 19th century, integrating the kingdoms of Jembrana, Buleleng and Karangasem into the Dutch East Indies, but the southern kingdoms of Tabanan, Badung and Klungkung had managed to remain independent. Various disputes took place between the Dutch and the southern kingdoms, and it was expected that the Dutch would intervene militarily once a pretext presented itself.Hanna, pp.139‚Äì140 There were recurrent disputes between the Dutch and Balinese kings regarding the right to plunder ships that foundered off the reefs surrounding Bali. According to Balinese tradition called tawan karang, the Balinese king traditionally considered such wrecks as their property, while the Dutch insisted they were not. On 27 May 1904, a Chinese schooner named Sri Kumala struck the reef near Sanur, and was plundered by the Balinese. Upon request for compensation by the Dutch, the kings of Badung refused to pay anything, supported by the king of Tabanan and the king of Klungkung. The ruler of Tabanan had also caused Dutch discontent by authorizing in 1904 the practice of suttee (ritual self- sacrifice of relatives upon the death of a ruler, also called wesatia) despite a Dutch formal request to abandon it. In June 1906, the Dutch started a blockade of the southern coasts and sent various ultimata.  Intervention  On September 14, 1906, a substantial force of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, named the Sixth Military Expedition, landed at the northern part of Sanur beach. It was under the command of Major General M.B. Rost van Tonningen.Hanna, pp.140‚Äì141 Badung soldiers made some attacks on the bivouacs of the Dutch at Sanur on September 15, and there was some resistance again at Intaran village. Notice at the Bali Museum = Kesiman = Overall, the force managed to move inland without much resistance, and arrived in the city of Kesiman on 20 September 1906. There, the local king, a vassal of the king of Badung, had already been killed by his own priest, as he had refused to lead an armed resistance against the Dutch, the palace was in flames and the city was deserted. = Denpasar = The force marched to Denpasar, Bali, as if in a dress parade. They approached the royal palace, noting smoke rising from the puri and hearing a wild beating of drums coming from within the palace walls. Upon their reaching the palace, a silent procession emerged, led by the Raja being borne by four bearers on a palanquin. The Raja was dressed in traditional white cremation garments, wore magnificent jewellery, and carried a ceremonial kris. The other people in the procession consisted of the Raja's officials, guards, priests, wives, children and retainers, all of whom were similarly attired. They had received the rites of death, were dressed in white, and had had their ritual kris blessed.Barski, p.49 Wrapping the body of the Raja. When the procession was a hundred paces from the Dutch force, they halted and the Raja stepped down from the palanquin and signalled a priest, who plunged his dagger into the Raja's breast. The rest of the procession began killing themselves and others, in a rite known as Puputan (\\"Fight to the death\\"). Women mockingly threw jewellery and gold coins at the troops. A 'stray gunshot' and an 'attack by lance and spear' prompted the Dutch to open fire with rifles and artillery. As more people emerged from the palace, the mounds of corpses rose higher and higher. The whole procession numbered hundreds, and is said to have been over 1,000 people in all. It was mown down by Dutch gunfire.Haer, p.38 Alternative accounts describe that the Dutch first opened fire on the Balinese people moving outside of the palace gate, only equipped with traditional krises, spears and shields, and that survivors killed themselves, or had themselves killed by their followers according to the dictates of the puputan. The soldiers stripped the corpses of the valuables and sacked the ruins of the burned palace. The palace of Denpasar was razed to the ground. The same afternoon, similar events occurred in the nearby palace of Pemecutan, where the co-ruler Gusti Gede Ngurah resided. The Dutch let the nobility at Pemecutan kill themselves, and proceeded with the looting. Monument to the 1906 Puputan, located in Taman Puputan, Denpasar, Bali. The massacre is remembered locally as the \\"Badung Puputan\\" and is glorified as an example of resistance to foreign aggression. A huge bronze monument was elevated on the central square of Denpasar, where the royal palace used to stand, glorifying Balinese resistance in the Puputan. = Tabanan = The Dutch force continued to the kingdom of Tabanan, where the king Gusti Ngurah Agung and his son fled, then surrendered to the Dutch, and attempted to negotiate a settlement to become a regency of the Dutch. The Dutch only offered them exile to nearby Madura or Lombok, and they preferred to kill themselves (puputan) in prison two days later.Hanna, pp.143‚Äì144 Their palace was plundered and razed by the Dutch.Hanna, p.144 = Klungkung = Dewa Agung of Klungkung, nominal ruler of all Bali, arriving in Gianyar to negotiate with the Dutch. The Dutch also moved troops to Klungkung and considered an attack on king Dewa Agung, the nominal ruler of all Bali, but eventually refrained from it as Dewa Agung refrained from military action against the Dutch and agreed to sign agreements to destroy his fortifications, deliver his firearms and renounce import and export taxes. A strong pretext for the Dutch to attack Klunkung would appear later, and materialize in the 1908 Dutch intervention in Bali, which would put a final end to autochthonous rule in Bali.  Aftermath  In the short term, the 1906 Dutch invasion in Bali, and its sequel in 1908, sealed the Dutch control of the island. The Dutch invasion however was followed closely by media coverage, and reports of the bloody conquest of the southern part of the island filtered to the West. The disproportion between the offense and harshness of the punitive actions was pointed out. The image of the Netherlands as a benevolent and responsible colonial power was seriously affected as a consequence. The Netherlands, also under criticism for their policies in Java, Sumatra and the eastern island, decided to make amends, and announced the establishment of an \\"Ethical policy\\".Hanna, p.171 As a consequence, the Dutch in Bali turned students and protectors of Balinese culture and endeavored to preserve it in addition to their initial modernization role. Efforts were made at preserving Bali culture and at making it a \\"living museum\\" of classical culture, and in 1914, Bali was opened to tourism.Barski, p.50 The very harshness of the 1906 and 1908 military invasions thus paradoxically triggered an international uproar which contributed to the preservation of Bali's culture, to make the island one of the most popular tourist destinations today.  In fiction  Vicki Baum's 1937 historical novel Love and Death in Bali (Liebe und Tod auf Bali) tells of a family caught up in the 1906 events. The book was written after Baum's visit to Bali 1935, when she became close friends with Walter Spies, a German painter who lived on the island for many years and who provided her with much information on these events - at the time still well within living memory.

Though it is in Collins, mail is postmarked to the Gowanda ZIP code of 14070. It is located on the northern side of Zoar Valley. History The area was first inhabited during the Stone Age by Algonquians, a nomadic people. An Algonkian mound from the first or second Stone Age is located on a farm in the area of Rosenburg along Zoar in Gowanda. The mound is believed to be about 3,500 years old, with artifacts including spearheads, copper heads, and stone implements of a crude nature having been excavated from the site.Kirby, C.D. (1976). The Early History of Gowanda and the Beautiful Land of the Cattaraugus. Gowanda, NY: Niagara Frontier Publishing Company, Inc./Gowanda Area Bi-Centennial Committee, Inc. A little-known fact about the area, not written in any history books and known only to some locals, is that it was a station in the Underground Railroad. A functional tunnel of the Underground Railroad, still in existence today, connects a former train drop-off area of the New York and Lake Erie Railroads near the foot of Gowanda-Zoar Road to an outlet on the property formerly owned by William and Evelyn (Merrill) Glazier, a local surgeon and nurse. Located on Gowanda-Zoar Road, the home was used as a safe house for former slaves escaping to free states and Canada from Southern states around the 1860s and the time of the American Civil War. A homemade railroad sign is posted on the property at the location of the tunnel's outlet. Notable within the Zoar area are maple trees that are approximately 200‚Äì300 years old. Many of these trees are located along South Quaker Street and Vail Road. Each spring for decades, the trees have been tapped by locals in order to make maple syrup and maple sugar candy. Several of the trees have become diseased and have died in recent years, with some having to be cut down. Others were cut by the Highway Department when South Quaker Street was repaved and realigned with the section crossing Gowanda-Zoar Road that connects it to Vail Road around 1990‚Äì1995. Community The Zoar community includes many homes and families living throughout a hilly area with pastures, fields, woods, ponds, and open land. Some residents own farms with dairy cows, horses, and other animals; other residents own homes and property that does not include a farm or farmland. Notable businesses For many years, the area tree nursery company, Congdon and Weller Nurseries, owned fields in the area and grew trees, shrubs, and other plants and crops there. Presently and for several decades, the farming company, Capella Farms, has operated on South Quaker Street. On the Vail Road section of Zoar, an excavation site operated by the Gernatt Family of Companies is present. In 2013, residents of the area expressed concerns about changes to the natural environment, the water table, wells, and springs due to a proposed mining expansion by the companies on the site.Collins residents air their concerns, The Observer, Dunkirk, NY: John D'Agostino, 29 September 2011, McDonnell, S.

Most residents in the area get their water from wells or springs, so there is understandable concern about the companies' proposed mining expansion there that would affect the water supply.

Its larvae feed on the roots of crops. The cucurbit beetle (Diabrotica speciosa) is also known to transmit several viruses such as comoviruses and different mosaic viruses. Diabrotica speciosa (D. speciosa) is native to South America and is now distributed in Central America and other global areas. Common names include the Cucurbit Beetle and San Antonio beetle. Their native land is South America in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Their current distribution is in Central America including countries such as Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama. There are no known location or year of first introduction of D. speciosa to new habitats.  Distribution  D. speciosa can move locally by adult flight, and by movement of eggs, larvae or pupae in soil contaminating vehicles or farm machinery. For long-distance spread, adults could be present on host plants for planting, but these are not of the kind normally moved in international trade, and the active adults will not necessarily remain on their hosts. Larvae could be associated with ground crops like groundnuts or potatoes, and the underground parts of maize, wheat or soybean because they are unlikely to be moved. It also is not likely that the larval hosts would be traded as plants with soil.  Ecological role  In their native and newly acquired habitats, D. speciosa is an important pest throughout southern South America (except Chile), but, being highly polyphagous (feeds on various foods), qualitative reports of its impact on different crops vary in different regions. It is considered an important pest of maize, cucurbits, and orchard crops throughout its distribution. Although it migrates as an adult, no information on observed distances has been found. There is evidence that D. speciosa is a viral vector for comoviruses, southern bean mosaic virus, mimosa mosaic virus, tymoviruses (such as passionfruit yellow mosaic virus), carmoviruses, and purple granadilla mosaic virus. D. speciosa transmitted cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV ‚Äì comovirus) to bean. Eggplant mosaic virus (EMV ‚Äì tymovirus) was transmitted to tobacco by D. speciosa. D. speciosa may also transmit bacterial wilt, caused by Erwinia tracheiphila, in cucurbits.  Factors in establishment  Predators of D. speciosa are infrequent in their new habitats. This likely aids in their establishment. D. speciosa is cold-tolerant and overwinters as an adult. This positively impacts their success in colder climates. They hide in the crown or rosettes of winter-growing plants. In the spring, adults emerge to feed on the host plant. Adults like to feed on pollen-rich flowers such as cucurbits, thistle, and sunflower. Eggs are oviposited on the soil close to a host plant. Larvae complete three instars while feeding on the roots of the host plant and pupate in the soil. Multiple generations are possible. In tropical areas, the cucurbit beetle reproduces continuously.  Control methods  Plant protection products are widely used to control D. speciosa, either applied to the soil to control larvae or to the above-ground parts to control adults (according to the crop concerned). Intensive use of products is required to control larvae in soil. In southern Brazil, IPM programs combine no-till agriculture, rotation of soybeans with maize or wheat, and use of insecticides only when damage is evident. Using this system, wheat is produced with virtually no pesticides in this area. Adults can be lured to baits composed of insecticide on the cucurbitacin-rich roots of wild cucurbits. Although some natural enemies of D. speciosa are known there is no prospect of biological control of this species.  Status of mitigation  D. speciosa was added in 2002 to the European Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) A1 action list of pests, and endangered EPPO member countries are thus recommended to regulate it as a quarantine pest. In general, most EPPO countries prohibit the import of soil, and restrict the import of plants with soil, from other continents. This measure should be effective against D. speciosa. Host plants should be free from the pest.  Morphology  = Egg = During eggs stage (Ovoid, about 0.74 √ó 0.36 mm, clear white to pale yellow), D. speciosa becomes active in mid-spring and quickly starts locating host plants for feeding and egg deposition. Females oviposit throughout the field and eggs typically hatch within 6‚Äì9 days and can take up to 30 days with under low temperature conditions. Eggs are yellow, oval shaped laid in clusters of 25-50 below leaf surface, and measure about 0.7 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. Adult females deposit eggs in soil crevices at or near the base of cucurbit plants. Freshly laid eggs are completely dependent on soil moisture for their survival. After eggs hatch, larvae start feeding on plant roots. = Larvae = D. speciosa then transitions to larvae stage (8.5 mm long at maturity, subcylindrical; chalky white; head capsule dirty yellow-light brown) where it requires seven, five, and four days for development of first, second and third instars, respectively or a total of 2-3 ¬Ω weeks for complete larval development. The last stage larva constructs a small chamber in the soil and pupates within that chamber. = Pupae stage = Once transitioning to pupae (5.8‚Äì7.1 mm long; white, formed in an 8 √ó 4 mm oval cell in the soil), a pair of stout spines is present on the tip of the abdomen and smaller spines are found on the dorsal side of other abdominal segments. Pupal period varies from 6‚Äì10 days. = Adult = D. speciosa is then finally ready to enter the adult stage (Adults are 5.5‚Äì7.3 mm long; General colour grass-green, with yellow spots). The head and legs are black, and the beaded black antennae are about 1.6 mm long. Adults are most active in the morning and late afternoon. The beetle overwinters during the adult stage near buildings, wood lots or in fence rows. Overwintering adults become active once the temperature reaches 15-20 ¬∞C. Adults are long lived: 60 days in summer and up to 200 days in winter. Adults start ovipositing 2‚Äì3 weeks after emergence.  Diet  The larvae of D. speciosa feed on roots of maize, wheat, groundnut, soybean and potato, and various other crop and non-crop hosts. The adults are highly polyphagous, being recorded on over 60 species, mainly vegetables, but are particularly associated with Cucurbitaceae (e.g., Cucurbita maxima, Cucurbita pepo). They feed on every part of the plant above ground. In maize, their feeding on newly emerging silks prior to pollination is most serious, resulting in sparsely filled ears. Serial reduction in the number of ripening kernels from the tip of the ear to the base can often be observed at harvest. Whilst the adults do feed on young maize leaves, this is of secondary importance. = Affected plants = The affected plants of D. speciosa include cucumber, cantaloupe, squash, gourd, pumpkin, corn, soybean, cotton, beans, potato, grape, sweet potato, tomato, cassava, rice, sorghum, wheat, cabbage, amaranth, peanut, watermelon, bell pepper, mulberry, pea, beet, okra, onion, lettuce, and oats.  As invasive species and viral vectors  D. speciosa threaten the lives of many crops and they act as vectors for many viruses, which contributes to human/animal health if consuming infected crops. They not only feasts on cucurbits but on beans, grapes, and potatoes too. The damage caused reduces the amount of food available to the plant for growth, consequently lowering the yield. They can transmit plant diseases. The most commonly-spread are bacterial wilt and the cucumber mosaic virus. D. speciosa (Germar) is one of the chrysomelid more widely distributed in crops of Argentina. They can move locally by adult flight, and probably by movement of eggs, larvae or pupae in soil contaminating vehicles or farm machinery. For long-distance spread, adults could be present on host plants for planting, but these are not of the kind normally moved in international trade, and the active adults will not necessarily remain on their hosts. Larvae could be associated with groundnuts or potatoes, but the underground parts of maize, wheat or soybean are unlikely to be moved. Nor is it likely that the larval hosts would be traded as plants with soil. Accordingly, the main potential pathway is soil as such.

The film was released in Hong Kong on 18 August 1989. Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah (alongside their opera school brother Yuen Tak) also served as action choreographers on the film. Similar to Highlander the film combines elements of sci-fi and historical fantasy with a contemporary setting and action. The film was nominated for three Hong Kong Film Awards in 1990. The film is related to the Eugene O'Neill play. A remake, titled simply Iceman, was released in April 2014 and a sequel to that remake, Iceman: The Time Traveller on November 2, 2018. Plot In 16th Century China, Ming guard Fong Sau-ching (Yuen Biao) relentlessly tracks the ruthless villain Feng San (Yuen Wah), who is notorious for raping and killing women. Feng San murders the princess and the emperor is furious that Fong Sau-ching wasn't able to save her. He gives Fong one last chance to capture Feng San within 20 days. After Feng San steals the priceless and magical Black Jade Buddha, a magical artifact that grants user the ability to time travel; Fong and Feng San are transported to 300 years in the future. Upon arrival, a titanic martial arts encounter atop a cliff ensues and is only ended when the two men tumble into a glacier where they are instantly frozen. Later being thawed out and awaken by scientists, Fong Sau-ching must continue his pursuit of his quarry although to survive in 1980s Kowloon with the confounding discovery of electricity, TV and toilets, he's going to need a little help from femme fatale Polly (Maggie Cheung). Polly hires Fong to be her servant and bodyguard since she knows of his martial arts expertise and in return she will help him get an ID card. Fong feels extremely shameful for not being able to capture Feng San and once a royal guard like himself is now a servant to a woman. Meanwhile, Feng San is still out and about and he's now a thief working for the local crime boss. He kills his boss after he was caught trying to rape his boss' girlfriend and a fight started. He then kills her in a brutal fashion of breaking her limbs. Later, Fong finds out that this whole time Polly was a prostitute and she's been using him the whole time, so he vows to not be her slave any longer. Around the same time, Fong reads a newspaper about a woman who's been murdered and her limbs are broken. He is instantly reminded of how Feng San kills his victims and now knows he's still alive. Feng San kidnaps Polly by pretending to be one of her clients. Fong goes to rescue her and is forced to admit that he loves Polly when Feng San has held her hostage. A big fight between Fong and Feng San ensues with Feng San being the victor and Fong severely injured but is able to recover after making it to the hospital. Feng San learns that the Buddha's wheel, the magical device that sent him to the future has been dug up and transported to a Hong Kong exhibit. He steals a load of firearms from the local arms dealer and plans to take the modern firearms back to the 16th century and conquer the dynasty. Fong is also aware of the Buddha's Wheel and predicts that Feng San will be there. He then trains for the upcoming battle and crafts a sword to combat Feng San. After finishing the sword he leaves Polly without her noticing because he doesn't want her to get involved. At the exhibit, Feng San finds a note on the wheel written by Fong that tells him to come up to the roof for the Black Jade, which he needs to activate the time travel device. On the roof top, Fong confronts Feng San and tells him that no matter what happens he will fulfill his duty to the emperor and take Feng San back to pay for his crimes. Fong eventually kills Feng San by impaling him on shards of broken glass. He takes Feng San's body and activates the Buddha's wheel. Polly arrives at the scene but was too late. She watches tearfully as Fong leaves. Some time later, Polly quits being a prostitute and is now working at a corner store. As she went to take out the trash, she runs into a man who resembles Fong (possibly a reincarnation). She shouts with joy that Fong is still alive and leaps onto him even though the man has no idea who she is.

Main characters = Ares= Ares is the main protagonist. He is 18 years old when the story begins. He is the bastard son of a nobleman named Kaiser. His birth name is Sebastion, but he lost his memories at the age of 6 after jumping of a cliff during a failed assassination instigated by his half brother, the legitimate heir to their father. Kiron, the famous Master Swordsman of Chronos, chanced upon him during the assassination attempt, rescued him, and took him on as an apprentice. After 6 years, Kirberos, the weapon collecting Red-Eyed Swordsman, tracked down the retired recluse Kiron and killed him to collect his sword. Ares lost his right eye to Kirberos during this fight and vowed vengeance. After Killing Kirberos, Ares re-establishes the Temple mercenaries and becomes the commander. He, Baroona, and Douglas lead the mercenaries. Ares is last seen dancing with his girlfriend in a ball before the manhwa ends ... Ares is light-hearted and friendly in normal situations. He is goofy, cracks jokes, and behaves as if he is simple-minded. For example, he joins Temple Mercenaries because they provide meals for their members. In battle Ares is deadly. As expected of Kiron's apprentice, few can stand against his fighting ability. Throughout the course of his travels, Ares has either defeated or fought equally with various legendary characters from his universe. He fights with a sword, but he will eliminate weaker opponents with only kicks or elbow strikes. His swordplay and fighting style incorporate quick, hard strikes, and acrobatic maneuvers to both evade enemy attacks and enhance the momentum of his own. He makes good use of his environment: launching off walls, dropping chandeliers on enemies, taking swords from fallen soldiers if his own breaks. Temple Mercenaries gave him B-Rank status after his first skirmish. He is currently A-Rank although he calls himself A+. A year after he killed Mikael, Ares killed Kirberos and avenging his master.

He is 18 or 19 years old. Baroona is the calm middle ground between the personalities of Ares and Mikael. That is, he is more sensible than Ares and more sane than Mikael. He has a kind-hearted and laid back personality. Baroona fights with two daggers tied to the ends of a metal rope-the double dagger rope dart-a weapon given him by his former master and fellow gladiator (who also got him hooked on smokes). He became B-Rank after his first mission and is currently A-Rank. He, Ares, Mikael, and Gogh belong to the Temple Mercenaries, 4th Regiment, 2nd Squadron, Troop 3. Baroona, alongside Robin and six other Temple Mercenaries, survived the assault when they were sent away on a mission to protect a rich family. While there, he developed a friendship with a young girl. A year after Ares killed Mikael, Baroona joined the hunt for Kirberos with Ares. When they do encounter Kirberos, Baroona defends an unconscious Ares, the resulting battle breaking his knives. Eventually, him and Ares split the bounty money to reestablish the Temple Mercenaries, along with Douglas and Gogh. Baroona first appears in Chapter 2. =Gogh= Also known as Gohu, Gohue, etc. Gogh is an artist and a soldier who can't fight. He joined the mercenaries because he wanted to paint epic battles and believes the proper way to capture them is to experience the battles first hand. Despite his cowardice, he shows courage and loyalty to his friends. Gogh has no fighting ability and rose to B-Rank by surviving enough battles by hiding, playing dead, or relying on the abilities of his friends. After the war with Mikael, he becomes a highly respected artist. He, Ares, Mikael, and Baroona belong to the Temple Mercenaries, 4th Regiment, 2nd Squadron, Troop 3. During the Isiris war, Gogh survived the attack on the Temple Mercenaries by hiding from them, which Mikael anticipated. Afterwards, he developed a crush on Jill (who's actually Sandra of the Death Knights), which he couldn't purse because Rikion killed her. Gogh first appears in Chapter 4. =Emergency Food= Emergency Food is the name of the small black bird that hangs around with Ares. Ares was first annoyed by the bird's presence, but Gogh told him the bird could be used as emergency food. Since then the bird is usually seen perched on Ares' shoulder or helmet, occasionally Emergency Food rests on Gogh's shoulder too. When Ares is crucified by the Isiris Graccio soldiers, Emergency Food protects Ares from being eaten by the larger birds of prey. Emergency Food first appears in Chapter 19. Temple Mercenaries Temple Mercenaries is the most respected soldiers-for-hire operation in Chronos. =Douglas= A mercenary from Marlan. He has a scar on his right cheek and blonde (or white) shaggy hair that covers his left eye. He confronts Ares because he wants to see which of them is a better fighter, but they have to end their fight early. They become friends soon after and he eventually joins Ares, Baroona, Robin, and Gogh's group. Douglas is an intelligent and very strong fighter. Like Mikael and Ares, he is a swordsman, although not at their level. He is also smooth with the ladies, although he was once beaten by Helena for hitting on Ariadne, before finding out she was Ares' girlfriend. =One-Armed Jack= One-Armed Jack is an A-Rank soldier. He also has a scar across the bridge of his nose. He is a strong fighter whose ability forces Carnival to fight with both swords. In that battle, he tires and is rescued when Mikael resumes the fight in his stead. One-Armed Jack, often referred to as One-Armed-Sunbae, always dreamed of running a bakery shop when he retired from the Temple Mercenaries. One-Armed Sunbae died in the Daraak vs Chronos war, his last battle before he was going to retire, promising to Ares that he'd serve him bread. His death spurned Ares to fight even harder against Cygnus. One-Armed Jack first appears in Chapter 7. =Robin= A mute and extremely skilled archer of the Temple Mercenaries. He became close friends with Ares,Baroona,Douglas and Gogh. He was killed in battle after wounding Mikael with an arrow and saving Icarus. His actions forced Mikael's troops to withdraw to heal Mikael. Chronos Chronos is the central nation in the geography of this story. Despite past conflict, it had enjoyed ten years of relative peace. However, the country's strength waned with the sanity and judgment of its king. =Ariadne= The love interest for Ares. She is the daughter of Lord Gizelle and innocent of the world. She follows Ares into the battle at Minos, taking for simple truth his statement that fighting was \\"fun\\". He saved her many times and diverted her from witnessing the worst of the battle. After Ares was wounded, Ariadne treated him. When Minos' assassins came and tried to take her and Helena away to Darrak to be sold as slaves, Ares saved them, but Ariadne called him a savage and left him (due to how brutally he killed everyone). Helena chastised her for that, and Ariadne returned and remains his girlfriend. Ariadne was targeted by Mikael and his Death Knights in an effort to kidnap her. When in all reality, Mikael wanted to keep her safe from the war. Ariadne first appears in Chapter 19. =Antonis= Antonis is an admiral in Chronos' army. He assassinates the king of Chronos and tries to have Icarus assassinated also. He takes over the country for a brief period of time, during the civil war. During a meeting with Daarak for an alliance against Icarus, he was killed by Cygnus. Antonis first appears in Chapter 21. =Carnival= Carnival was previously an A-Rank soldier for the Temple Mercenaries and their top fighter. He was known to be merciless and was kicked out for killing a comrade over a trivial matter. He was nicknamed \\"Bloodmaster\\". Carnival uses two swords and a manic fighting style that reflects his savage nature. Carnival joins an ex-general of Chronos, Shion, and creates with him a bandit group. Carnival meets with the Temple Mercenaries again when they are hired to destroy the bandit group. Carnival nearly kills One-Arm Jack when he is stopped by Mikael who fights with him while the rest of the Temple Mercenaries go onward to fight Shion. Carnival is narrowly defeated by Michael who spares his life causing Carnival to be in Michael's debt while at the same revering him. Carnival is later recruited by Michael to be part his personal guard, and is killed by Baroona. Carnival first appears in Chapter 7. =Genasis= Icarus' right-hand man. Genesis was considered unworthy at his dojo but Icarus notes him and decides to make him his underling although it shocks the other students and master. Genesis claims that he will do what his master wants him to do: if Icarus says to win he will, and if he says to lose, he will. Genesis is killed by one of the Death Knight‚Äôs leaders. Mikael then sends his head to Icarus to unnerve him. Genesis has great skill in swordsmanship and is even respected by Carnival. He is defeated by the two Death Knight leaders, Sandra/Ray/Rei, Carnival, and Esteban when he was trying to kill Mikael. Genesis first appears in Chapter 21. =Gizelle= Ariadne's father. He is a nobleman who supports Icarus during the civil war. =Helena= Helena is the acknowledged strongest fighter in the port city of Nix and the bodyguard of the Lord Gizelle's daughter, Ariadne. She is initially hostile to Ares and thinks he is a bad influence on Ariadne. When Ariadne stowed away with the soldiers headed to Minos, she realized immediately and set off to rescue her. She warmed to Ares after he protected her and Ariadne from assassins during the invasion of Minos. She has a glare that can discourage most men to approach Ariadne. Helena first appears in Chapter 19. =Icarus= Icarus was a young general who became the youngest king of Chronos. He first commissioned Temple Mercenaries to help with the pre-emptive invasion of Minos. He hired Mikael, Baroona, Ares, and Gogh as a personal escort for the preliminary talks with the Radnik Alliance. He again hired Temple Mercenaries to assist with the civil war in Chronos after the previous king was assassinated and with the war with the Radnik Alliance shortly afterwards. After the Civil War, the former king's advisors offered him the kingship. Icarus is a calm, thoughtful man, respected and loved by his soldiers. His skill lies with military strategy more than battle, but he fights competently when needed. He also has a good eye for ability, selecting his right-hand man, Genesis, despite that man's bad reputation. He is also a notorious smoker, which he can't give up because of all of the trouble that he has do deal with. Icarus first appears in Chapter 19. =Kiron= Kiron is the Master Swordsman of Chronos. After much battle prestige, Kiron chose a quiet retirement over a government post. By chance he saved the child Ares from an assassin and raised him. During their six years together as master and apprentice, he imparted his skills to the boy as his eyesight slowly failed. They lived quietly until Kirberos, the Red-Eyed Swordsman, tracked them down. Kiron fought well until Kirberos used Ares as bait to lure the now completely blind Master Swordsman into a wooded copse whose layout he did not know as well as his own property. Kirberos killed Kiron and added Kiron's sword to his collection. Ares vowed to not return to his master's grave until he had defeated the Red-Eyed Swordsman. The late Master Swordsman of Chronos was also known as the Swordsman of the Wind for the sound made by his blade as he fought. Kiron first appears in Chapter 5. =Mickey= A boy who lives in Jagsen village. Shion's bandits killed his parents when they raided his village. He antagonizes then supports Ares and his group, and promises to join the Temple Mercaneries when he becomes older. in the last chapter of Ares he is seen joining the new temple mercenaries to keep his promise with Ares. Mickey first appears in Chapter 4. =Shion= Previously a General of Chronos, Shion goes off to become a bandit lord. Shion uses a giant sword to fight that crushes and slices through most other weapons. The sheath alone weighs 30 kg. Despite the size and weight of his blade \\"Ionix\\", Shion moves extremely fast. Shion will fight with his sword sheathed until he finds an opponent that he considers worthy of his blade. Shion leads a bandit group that terrorizes a nearby town. Shion's group is eventually decimated by the Temple Mercenaries who were hired by the town to defend them. While Michael fights Carnival Shion crushes many Temple Mercenaries eventually meeting his match when Ares appears. Shion begins with the upper hand in battle against Ares but ends up succumbing to Ares' incredible strength. Shion tells Ares that he is born a hero and requests that his men be spared. Ares agrees and with that slices Shion's throat. Shion first appears in Chapter 5. =Pig= A large man and a leader in Shion's group of bandits. His soldiers comment that he would steal their food but was otherwise a good commanding officer. Ares kills him when Temple Mercenaries invade the bandits' headquarters. Pig first appears in Chapter 11. Daraak = Cygnus = Cygnus is the son of a deceased Daraakian general whose family fell from nobility to lower class. He loves a girl named Sara. He fought with great skill to protect her from the Black Knights, but their leader threatened her safety if he did not join them. He is defeated by Ares during the war with the Radnik Alliance. Ares spares his life when he discovers that Cygnus also has a girl waiting for him. However, Mikael murders the defenseless, exhausted Cygnus after Ares leaves him. He was about 19 years old at the time of his death. Cygnus displays pacifist behavior early into his story, but he is very protective of Sara. His father was killed in a war with Chronos, and his late mother raised him to hate all Chronosians. He still has nightmares about her and may be mentally unstable because of that. Cygnus fights with a spear inherited from his father. His skill is such that 10 captains of the Black Knights had to subdue him after he killed 150 regular soldiers from the 6th Regiment. He is called The Black Swan under the Black Knights army because his movements are like a swan. He leaps high and is noted to be acrobatic. =Sara= Girlfriend of Cygnus. She and Cygnus work for the same eatery. The Black Knights held her life hostage to force Cygnus to fight for them. Isiris = Mikael Graccio= Mikael is heir to the throne of Isiris. He is 18 years old. Mikael journeys to Chronos to fight with Temple Mercenaries and to experience the life of commoners. He is often seen with a leaf in his mouth. After the war with the Radnik Alliance, he receives intelligence of his father's failing health and his uncle's rebellion. He resigns his commission to return to his royal duties. After vanquishing his uncle, he decides to take Chronos for his own. During his time in Chronos, he'd ordered an elite army of children to be trained under the tutelage of Carnival, an ex-Temple Mercenary he defeated in an early battle. Mikael is intelligent, well-educated, and well-versed in military strategy. He is anti-social and considerate to only his closest friends. Like Ares and Baroona, he overlooks the cowardice of Gogh. He gave a spoil to Ares for his girlfriend, and he vowed to help Ares defeat the Red-Eyed Swordsman. He also exhibits considerable bloodlust, which has put him at odds with his comrades. For example, he killed enemy soldiers who have surrendered and allies with battle wounds asking for help. He also killed the exhausted, weaponless Cygnus after Ares had spared his life. Mikael is promoted to B-Rank after his first mission and A-Rank after the invasion of Minos. His victory over a hero of Minos caught the attention of Icarus during its invasion. He is a very strong fighter and typically fights with a sword. He, Ares, Baroona and Gogh belonged to Temple Mercenaries, 4th Regiment, 2nd Squadron, Troop 3. Mikael first appears in Chapter 1. While Isiris invaded Chronos, however, Mikeal dreaded every second of it, especially the attack on Temple Mercenaries Headquarters. He delayed the attacks on the headquarters until he knew Ares, Robin, Baroona, and Gohu at least would survive. He treasured all of the memories he had during the time he was in Chronos and his final words was that he was glad to have at least died at the hands of his best friend Ares, who misunderstood Mikeal's true intentions. = Kaiser= Silver Wolf Kaiser was Mikael‚Äôs master. He is an old man who lives with his grand daughter. He acts senile but is actually very sharp witted and skillful with his sword. He is first introduced after Icarus‚Äô defeat against Mikael at Hakuna.Mikael takes Kaiser's granddaughter hostage in order to blackmail him into assassinating Icarus. By this time, Icarus has recruited Ares,Baruna and Douglas as bodyguards, so Kaiser ends up fighting the three and being killed by Ares. When he was younger he fought with Kiron. He defeats Kiron after several hours of fighting, but doesn't kill him. As he leaves, he tells Kiron not to waste the life that he has spared. =Sandra= One of the leaders of the Death Knights that serves under Mikael. One of two, the other being Nikolai, who knows of Mikael's real intention towards Ares, Baroona, Gogh, and Robin. She went under the alias of Jill when taking care of Ares' PTSD after the Youth Brigade and the Death Knights slaughtered the Temple Mercenaries. Gogh developed a slight crush on her. She gave Ares and Gogh Mikael's plans for keeping Ariadne and Ares out of the war, but Gogh lost it when bandits attacked. She's very skilled in battle, using a claw attached to a chain, like Baroona. She was the first one to hit Robin when he hit Mikael with an arrow, and she eventually killed him. She was the last one to die when she tried to defend Mikaels dead body, being killed by Rikion. Minos = No-Name Knights= An elite group of knights serving the Kingdom of Minos.They were eliminated during an ambush battle with the Temple Mercenaries during the Minos Invasion Arc. Red-Eyed Clan Members of the Red-Eyed Clan have a natural fighting ability that exceeds that of normal men. They tried to live a pacifist life and declined to fight for a king. That king aggressively exterminated them directly and by offering bounties. =Kirberos= Kirberos is the Red-Eyed Swordsman. He is infamous for killing other swordsmen and collecting their swords. He killed the Master Swordsman Kiron after Kiron had gone blind and took the right eye of his young apprentice, Ares. Although he is of mixed blood, his eyes are a \\"purer\\" red than full-blooded Red-Eyes. He is younger brother to the captain of the Black Knights, but he refuses to acknowledge his \\"weak\\" older brother. Kirberos fighting ability is so fearsome that none will claim bounty on him. The weapons of those he defeats he wears on his person and switches them out during battle. He currently has six swords in Chapter 204. The first two are swords that he uses at the same time, he is ambidextrous, are swords of high quality but are not unique in any other way. The second pair are sword, he ties together to form a weapon like Baroona‚Äôs. The wire is not as strong as Baroona‚Äôs wire based on the fact that Ares easily cuts through it. However the swords are so sharp they can also easily cut through Baroonas wire, although previous characters have failed to. His fifth sword is a bendy sword that he used to take Kiron‚Äôs left eye. Ares nicknames it the Squid/Tentacle sword. It is used in the way that when a swordsman tries to block it with a sword, it will curve around the sword and stab them. It can be blocked by a long weapon, Ares counters it with a house lamp. The final sword, not yet shown in action is Ares' master‚Äôs sword. It was the most recent sword that the Red-Eyed swordsman has gained. He is killed by Ares. Kirberos first appears in Chapter 15. =Nicolai= Nicolai is one of Mikael's closest guards. When Mikael sends his other elite guards including Carnival away, Nicolai and Sandra/Ray are told of Mikaels real plan. Nicolai has red eyes and fights with a light scythe. He is killed by Ares on a mission to kidnap Ares' girlfriend. Nicolai's real intentions however were to move Ariadne and Helena away so they wouldn't get hurt by the war. Silonica = Rikion= Rikion is a young general from Silonica. He has a dark Mohawk and gold hoop earrings. His brash, provocative temperament puts him at odds with the Temple Mercenaries and Genesis, although Icarus tends to overlook this. Rikion's attempts to fight strong enemies are often usurped by Ares, Mikael and Baroona to comedic effect. He is, however,a very skilled and capable fighter. His troops respect him very much. They are very loyal to him, even turning around in the middle of a retreat to go back and rescue him, although sometimes they just cheer Rikion on without joining the fight themselves, much to his annoyance and disappointment. Rikion uses a weapon slightly similar to Baroona's, a sword connected to a chain. He appears to be 17‚Äì19 years old. Rikion first appears in Chapter 22.

Overview  Besides our world, there exist alternate worlds whose development did not follow ours. All of these worlds are called the worlds of the Fan. Passages exist between these worlds, which are opened through the houses of customs officers-functionals, which often look like towers (at least most of the ones operated by males). Some of these worlds are inhabited, while others are devoid of human presence. However, it is possible that all worlds are inhabited. Initially, it is stated that there are only two dozen worlds. Later, though, it is revealed that the number is much higher.  Functionals  All inhabited worlds feature a small percentage (about 1 in 20,000) of special people called functionals. Functionals are people who have been \\"erased\\" from their lives and granted certain superhuman abilities, which work only within a certain area no more than 200 square kilometers (about 77 square miles). There is also a very small number of functionals who are not attached to a specific location. Usually, all abilities of a functional are directly linked to his or her function. Functionals began to appear on our Earth in the 1810s. = Becoming a functional = The process of a human turning into a functional starts with everyone forgetting him or her, starting with random acquaintances and ending with immediate family members. This process can take anyone from two-three days to several weeks. The \\"forgetting\\" is not instantaneous. Other people will, at first, still recognize the future functional, albeit with some difficulty. Then they will get a sense of deja vu upon meeting him or her and, eventually, forget about the functional completely. At the same time, all official documents and records related to the person disappear, and most personal effects (ID, apartment/house keys, etc.) turn to dust. His or her house or apartment is occupied by other people who are convinced that they have always lived there. If the functional meets anyone during this period, the new acquaintance immediately forgets him or her upon departure. At the end of this period, the new functional receives a message, inviting him or her to a certain place. The type of the message depends on the level of technology at the time. For example, in modern times, the functional gets a text message, while in the 1920s, one would get a telegram delivered by a postman-functional. Upon arriving to the specified location, the functional sees a house, which becomes his or her function (place of residence/work). The message is sent by a midwife-functional, whose function is to help the process of \\"birthing\\" new functionals. = Abilities and limitations of functionals = Functionals have superhuman abilities related to their function as well as all the necessary knowledge. Some functionals (such as customs officers and police officers) are granted advanced physical abilities (superstrength and superspeed) and knowledge of martial arts, allowing them to easily defeat several well-trained humans. There are, however, not equal in combat abilities ‚Äî while a customs officer is a superior combatant, even he or she is incapable of defeating a police officer. Functionals do not age or get sick; they look younger than their biological age and are able to regenerate. A functional's regenerative ability is more advanced the closer he or she is to his or her function. Inside his or her function, a functional is nearly invulnerable (it is suggested that even beheading a functional inside his or her function would not kill him or her). The functional's place of work/residence restructures itself in accordance with the functional's wishes. There are, however, limitations to this: the function will only create the bare minimum required for a more or less comfortable life. It will not create food, items of luxury, money or anything living. Functionals are allowed (and, usually, welcome) to use the services of other functionals. A functional is tied to his or her function with a so- called \\"leash\\". A typical length of a \\"leash\\" is 10-11 kilometers (about 6.5 miles). While a functional is able to go beyond this radius, he or she loses all functional abilities. A functional's \\"leash\\" also extends to other worlds through customs. For example, if a functional lives 4 kilometers away from a customs office, he or she can only go 6-7 kilometers away from the customs office on another world. A functional is incapable of completely reject his or her function but can make his or her duties extremely easy (for example, a maid-functional whose hotel is never occupied). = Types of functionals = Most functionals have regular human jobs (doctor, restaurant owner, etc.). Their services are available to other functionals and the select humans who are aware of their existence. These humans are usually the social elite, such as politicians, moguls, artists, and others. The relations between the social elite and the functionals differ from world to world. Police officer- functionals maintain order among the functionals. They are granted highly developed reasoning as well as combat abilities. Their function is not a specific place but a certain territory. Customs officer-functionals operate the customs between worlds. They open doors to other worlds, let people through them and prevent the import and export of illegal goods. They also charge tariffs for certain items. All proceeds are kept by the customs officers. Only a customs officer is able to open doors in his or her function. They instinctively know everything the visitors are carrying and all the appropriate tariffs. Midwife-functionals help new functionals leave their lives behind and find their function. They are extremely powerful and are able to kill a human in another room by stopping his or her heart with a thought. They can also destroy a functional's function, which would usually kill the affected functional as well. Midwives are not tied to specific locations or territories; their function covers an entire world.  Customs  Customs are doorways to other worlds. The customs are operated by a customs officer- functional, the only person who is able to let others through the doors. A customs office is not dependent on the outside worlds and can only be destroyed by a thermonuclear warhead. The ratio of customs officers to all functionals is surprisingly high. For example, Moscow has 17 customs officers for only 700 functionals. Passageways between worlds are usually limited to 2 square meters (i.e. the size of a door). It is extremely difficult to create a passageway that would allow a large object (such as a tank) to pass, while anything larger is physically impossible.  Worlds of the Fan  = Earth 1 (Arkan) = This world was long thought to be most similar to ours but historically ahead by 35 years. It was later discovered that, historically, Arkan is actually behind. However, in several areas, most notably in military technology, it is more advanced than Demos. Uses the other worlds as test sites for various experiments. For example, Demos is used as a platform for developing technology. However, this use of other worlds by Arkan led to its war with the world of Tverd, which was originally supposed to be the test site for the development of biotechnology. Arkan controls other worlds with the use of functionals. Geographically, Arkan is very similar to Demos. = Earth 2 (Demos) = Our world. One of the most technologically advanced worlds in the Fan. Named so due to democracy being the prevailing form of government. = Earth 3 (Veroz) = A world without petroleum, which caused its technological development to stall (due to interference from Arkan) at the level of Demos in the 19th century (making Veroz an example of a steampunk world). Veroz fauna is also different from Demos fauna. For example, traveling the seas is dangerous, as krakens are real in this world. Also, there are nearly two dozen species of dinosaurs in existence in Africa. The generic shape of continents on Veroz is similar to Demos continents with some significant differences. For example, India is an island not a peninsula. Also, Veroz's complex political system is also radically different from ours. It includes elements of feudalism and democracy, while our version of democracy is seen as primitive. There are no nation-states on Veroz. While there are occasional alliances between the many city-states, they are usually fragile and do not survive the end of wars. As such, wars on Veroz would be seen by Demos inhabitants as nothing more than localized conflicts. Known cities: Kimgim in place of Stockholm, Orysultan in place of Moscow, and Zarhtan in place of Saint- Petersburg. Islam is a peaceful religion and is most prominent in Orysultan. Isa the Prophet is the Veroz version of Jesus Christ, with Christians being an aggressive religious minority. = Earth 4 (Antik) = A world artificially stalled at the level of Ancient Greece (hence the name). Slavery is a major part of everyday life on Antik, with several major differences between slavery in Demos history. A master may not claim a slave's property for himself. This means that it is not uncommon for a slave to be wealthier than his master and have servants and concubines (but not slaves of his own). Twice a year, slaves are handed out weapons, so that they can rebel. If a slave succeeds, he trades places with his master. = Earth 5 = A friendly and attractive world, whose technological development is at the level of Demos in the 1950s. Its inhabitants are close to developing space travel. There is, however, a biological curiosity which makes the sociopolitical structure of Earth 5 very complicated ‚Äî humans have a set mating season in spring, just like animals. = Earth 8 (Tverd) = A world dominated by the Catholic Church. While several nations do exist on Tverd, their governments handle the lower-level day-to-day management of their countries. The Church handles the theological and higher-level international issues. While the Church does exercise control over the entire world, they are so secure in their rule that they allow other religions to exist without persecution, including Islam, Judaism, and Orthodoxy, preferring to convince nonbelievers to convert through the use of philosophical debate rather than force. Tverd's level of development is mostly equal to the Late Medieval period of Demos history. The significant exceptions are the fields of biotechnology and genetics. Most devices and appliances are made from living things. For example, genetically modified medusae are used to create the Tverd equivalent of contact lenses, which can also be used to see certain wavelengths invisible to the naked eye (e.g. infrared). The Church has but one rule for genetic engineering: a human may not be modified in any way, as humans are made in the image of God. Other results of Tverd bioengineering efforts include Yorkshire Terriers able to leap many times their height into the air and kill a person within a few seconds, songbirds which act as biological recordings of songs, and flying gargoyles which act as the Church's air force. Tverd is the only well-known inhabited world that exists without interference from Arkan. Centuries ago, after the Church cardinals (the Church is ruled by the Cardinal Council instead of a single Pope) discovered the existence of functionals, they were systematically hunted down and eliminated in a manner similar to the witch-hunts of Demos during the Middle Ages. All known customs offices were immured, leaving one in Vatican, protected round- the-clock by female Swiss Guards and killer Yorkshire Terriers, to allow for diplomacy with the agents of Arkan. This customs office was also immured during the attempt by Arkan special forces to capture Kirill Maximov. = Earth 12 = This world is only mentioned once throughout both novels. Humanity does not exist on Earth 12, its place having been taken over by giant hairy spiders. = Earth 14 (Janus) = A world which is officially considered to be uninhabited. Later, it is discovered that Janus is populated by Stone Age-level humans. The geography of this world is unknown, but the climate is extremely harsh: furious winters and scorching summers. This is explained by the lack of sufficient solar energy (i.e. either the Sun is too far away, or it is weaker than ours). = Earth 16 = The functional homeworld and, possibly, Demos's future. Less than 10% of the surface is habitable, and the remaining inhabitants of this once-prosperous world live on islands. The remaining 90% of the planet, including the mainlands, is covered by a volcanically-active radioactive wasteland. All customs that open to Earth 16 only open to the mainlands, ensuring that no one finds out the truth about this world (most functionals believe Earth 16 to be Hell). The only remaining sign of this worlds former greatness is a strange-looking skyscraper on an inhabited island, unseen to most humans. The structure is, actually, a museum and holds little value to functionals. It is protected by an angel-like functional. = Earth 18 (Preserve) = An uninhabited world, although some believe that to be false. Used by functionals and some humans as a popular vacation spot. = Earth 22 (Nirvana) = A world used by functionals as a prison of sorts. This is achieved using the naturally occurring fungus which produces spores that have a narcotic effect on humans. The spores can only exist on Nirvana. A settlement has been built by humans who have been sent to this world by functionals. The settlement is located close to two customs offices (one after Kirill's was destroyed). Vasilisa, a customs officer- functional, helps the inhabitants and teaches their children. The humans themselves are so used to the narcotic effect of the fungus, that they are incapable of leaving Nirvana without suffering severe withdrawal. = Earth 46 = An unknown world, the existence of which is known only to the top functionals. It can be inferred that its level of technological development far exceeds all known worlds of the Fan. The humans of Earth 46 have advanced knowledge of quantum physics, putting them on the level with Earth 16 functionals. They are capable of building powerful combat robots, whose consciousnesses are copied from living or deceased humans. For example, on Earth 16, Kirill meets a robot from Earth 46, whose consciousness was copied from a poet named Anatol Lars, who was killed during the functional invasion of that world. On Earth 46, humans live in peace with the robots, and there are more of the latter. It is likely that robots are used as vessels for deceased humans who wish to live on in any form. After the functional invasion, Earth 46 was sealed forever from the rest of the Fan, preventing anyone from coming or leaving that world.

Discovered by NOAA, the patch is estimated to contain 20 times the density of floating debris compared to the global average. The project aims to study the extent and nature of the debris with a view to capturing, detoxifying, and recycling the material, and is organised by the Ocean Voyages Institute, a California-based 501c3 non-profit organisation dealing with marine preservation. The project is based in San Francisco and Hong Kong. History Project Kaisei was started in late 2008 by three co-founders from the San Francisco Bay Area, all with many years of ocean stewardship and activities behind them. As ocean lovers, Mary being a long time sailor, George a surfer and expert on surfboard design, and Doug with his open water swimming and paddling racing, each had different contacts and abilities to contribute to the group. With Doug living in Hong Kong, the group set up two points of operation on either side of the Pacific (San Francisco and Hong Kong) to help begin to bring all parties to the table to stem the flow of plastic and marine debris into our ocean. Project goals The project was launched on 19 March 2009, with plans for an initial phase of scientific study of the plastic debris in the North Pacific Gyre and feasibility study of the recovery and recycling technologies. The goal is to bring about a global collaboration of science, technology and solutions, to help remove some of the floating waste. New catch methods for the debris are being studied, which would have low energy input and low marine life loss. Technologies for remediation or recycling are being evaluated, to potentially create secondary products from the waste, which in turn could help subsidize a larger scale cleanup. The project has completed two expeditions, one in the summer of 2009, and one in 2010. New data on the issue has been collected, and more research and planning needs to be done in order to understand the metrics and costs associated with a larger scale cleanup effort. Planning is now taking place for future research and expeditions to take place which would allow for the testing of new capture technologies and equipment, as well as the demonstration of some of the remediation or recycling technologies that could be used. Initial voyage In August 2009, the initial study and feasibility voyage phase of Project Kaisei began, conducted by two vessels, the 174-foot (53-meter) diesel powered research vessel R/V New Horizon, and the project flagship, the 150-foot (46-meter) tall ship Kaisei.McFeely, Megan, \\"Earath's Eighth Continent,\\" common groundJuly/August,2009, pp. 16‚Äì17. The New Horizon, owned by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, left San Diego on 2 August 2009 on the Scripps Environmental Accumulation of Plastic Expedition (SEAPLEX), set to last until 21 August. The SEAPLEX expedition is funded by the University of California, San Diego, the National Science Foundation with supplemental funding from the Project Kaisei. Two days later the Kaisei a smaller tall ship, owned by the Ocean Voyages Institute, departed San Francisco on 4 August, and was expected to undertake a 30-day voyage. The Kaisei was to investigate the size and concentration of the debris field, and explore retrieval methods, while the New Horizon would join her and study the effect of the debris field on marine life. =Intensive sampling= On reaching the patch, 1,000 miles from the Californian coast, New Horizon began intensive sampling on 9 August. The crew took samples every few hours around the clock, using nets of various sizes and collecting samples at various depths. New Horizon returned on Friday 21 August 2009. SEAPLEX reported their initial findings on Thursday 27 August 2009, declaring that the patch stretched at least 1,700 miles across, and that from 100 consecutive surface samples taken along that 1,700 path track taken through the patch, plastic was found in every one. Miriam Goldstein, chief scientist of the SEAPLEX expedition described the findings as \\"shocking\\". Speaking about the patch, Goldstein added, \\"There‚Äôs no island, there‚Äôs no eighth continent, it doesn‚Äôt look like a garbage dump. It looks like beautiful ocean. But then when you put the nets in the water, you see all the little pieces\\". =Return= Kaisei returned to San Francisco on the morning of Monday 31 August. OVI founder and Project Kaisei co-founder Mary Crowley stated immediately following the Kaisei expeditions that the pollution was \\"what we expected to see, or a little worse.\\" Andrea Neal, principal investigator on the Kaisei speaking on Tuesday 1 September stated that \\"Marine debris is the new man-made epidemic. It's that serious\\". Kaisei and New Horizon together had conducted tests along over 3,500 miles of the ocean. Initial findings from the voyages concluded that the vast majority of the debris is small. The tiny portions of the debris field was said to be pervasive, and was found both at the surface and at deeper areas. It was also described as a \\"nearly inconceivable amount of tiny, confettilike pieces of broken plastic\\", increasing in density the further they sampled into the patch. Findings suggested that the presence of small debris, of a similar size to the existent marine life, could prove an obstacle to cleanup efforts. Larger debris found consisted of mainly plastic bottles, but also included shoe soles, plastic buckets, patio chairs, Styrofoam pieces, old toys and fishing vessel buoys, and a large collection of floating debris entangled in fishing net. Various types of marine life were found on, around and within the larger types of debris. Some of the garbage collected was put on display at the Bay Model Visitor Center in Sausalito, California. =Goal= The initial feasibility mission aimed to collect 40 tonnes of debris, using special nets designed not to catch fish, in two passes through the field. The project would later test methods of recycling the collected garbage into new plastic, or commercial products such as diesel fuel or clothing. If the initial mission proved the collection and processing technologies to be viable, it was expected that the Kaisei would lead a full scale commercial cleanup voyage with other vessels, becoming operational within 18 months. Fundraising and recognition Ocean Voyages Institute raised $500,000 for the Project Kaisei initial voyages. The SEAPLEX expedition cost $387,000, funded with $190,000 from UC Ship Funds, $140,000 from Project Kaisei and $57,000 from the National Science Foundation. Project Kaisei is also partnered with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. The group has since been recognized by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 2009 as a Climate Hero, by Google as a Google Earth Hero for its work with a video blogging voyage tracking system, and it was recently part of the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2010.

September 28, 1838 -‚Äì d. December 9, 1876) was an officer in the 7th Cavalry Regiment (United States), notable for his participation in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as Custer's Last Stand. Weir first served under General George Armstrong Custer during the American Civil War, and after the war continued serving under his command up to the famous battle in 1876. During the Little Bighorn battle, Weir disobeyed orders to remain in a defensive position at Reno Hill and led a cavalry group that attempted to come to Custer's aid. Weir and the group retreated back to Reno Hill in the face of overwhelming numbers of Native American warriors. A hill on the battlefield, Weir Point, is named in his honor and marks the farthest point of Weir's advance. Reportedly deeply depressed by his experience in the historic battle, Weir's health declined, and he died only a few months afterwards, aged 38. Civil War Experience Weir was born in Nashville, Ohio. He graduated from the University of Michigan in June 1861. On August 27, 1861, he enlisted in Company B of the 3rd Michigan Cavalry and earned quick promotion to first sergeant. By October 1861, he earned promotion to second lieutenant. In June 1862 Weir was promoted to first lieutenant. Shortly afterwards, he was taken prisoner by the Confederate States Army and was promoted again to captain during the seven months he was held captive. After his release, Weir was assigned as Assistant Inspector General on the staff of Major General George Armstrong Custer. In July 1868, Weir received brevet promotions to major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel to recognize his superior performance of duty during the war. Battle of the Little Bighorn and Weir Point During the Indian Wars on the Great Plains, Weir commanded Company D of the 7th Cavalry under Custer, as part of a two-pronged attack on a large Native American encampment on the Little Bighorn River in Montana on June 25, 1876. Custer had led a detachment north to attack the camp from that direction. Three companies, with Major Marcus Reno in overall command, attacked the south end of the village, but Reno's forces retreated from their initial attack on the south end of the village to a hilltop nearby, now known as Reno Hill, where they were joined by another three companies, including Weir's Company D, led by Captain Frederick Benteen as well as a pack train carrying supplies. Weir's company, without orders, (and eventually followed by other soldiers including Benteen) moved north from the defensive position on Reno Hill, heading in the direction of the sound of firing from the direction where they believed Custer and his troops were fighting. However, Weir and the would-be relief were forced to retreat back to Reno Hill under fire where they were under further attack until relieved by General Alfred Terry two days later, when the Native American warriors withdrew. Weir Point Also known as Weir Ridge, Weir Point is about three miles south from where Custer and the soldiers with him were killed and about one and a half miles north of Reno Hill. Weir Point is the location where Captain Weir and those with him eventually realized after two hoursLt. Edgerly (Carroll, The Gibson and Edgerly Narratives, p. 11: \\"We stayed out there [on the Weir Peaks] about 2 hours, according to my recollection....\\" that Custer was beyond their aid, and that hostile warriors were advancing towards the relief force in substantial numbers. From Weir Point the surviving members of the 7th Cavalry withdrew back to the already-established defensive positions on Reno Hill. In the present era, Weir Point is a modest pull-off on the paved lane that ends at Reno Hill, also known as the Reno-Benteen Battlefield. Weir Point is marked with an illustrated roadside sign naming the hill and showing an artist's rendition of what the artist believed Weir and those with him saw: clouds of dust rising from the bluffs to the north where Custer and his men were wiped out.https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=86823 Weir's Decline and Death Deeply shaken by his experience after the famous battle and showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, Weir's mental health declined rapidly. Weir wrote letters to Custer's widow, Elizabeth Bacon Custer, hinting at untold matters regarding her husband's death.http://www.historynet.com/libbie-custer-wounded- thing-must-hide.htm Formally posted back to New York City on recruiting duty, in the final months of his life he refused to go outside, began to drink heavily and in his last days was said to be extremely nervous, to the point of being unable to swallow. He died in New York City less than six months after Custer's death, reportedly in a state of extreme depression. He was buried at the Fort Columbus post cemetery on Governors Island in New York City. In the 1880s his remains were reinterred at Cypress Hills National Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

She underwent a protracted \\"medium refit\\" from June 2006 until May 2015 at the Hindustan Shipyard at Visakhapatnam. The midlife upgrade was projected to be completed in 3 years but numerous delays postponed the submarine's return.

It was originally planned to send her to Russia for the upgrade, like her sister ships Sindhughosh, Sindhuvir, Sindhuratna, and Sindhuvijay. However, it was decided that Sindhukirti would be upgraded indigenously. Hindustan Shipyard was selected for the refit due to political wrangling, against the wishes of the navy staff.http://www.business- standard.com/article/current-affairs/scorpene-subs-to-join-fleet-without- torpedoes-114051500200_1.html HSL had a history of prolonging submarine refits, taking ten years to upgrade each of the Vela-class submarines Vela and Vagli. Sindhukirti's refit was scheduled for 3 years, but the refit dragged on as problems arose. The ship became known as the dockyard queen. In 2009, Admiral Sureesh Mehta explained, \\"That kind of expertise did not exist in India before and this is for the first time that we are trying it out here. Instead of sending them to Russia all the way, this one is being offloaded to Hindustan Shipyards. There are some problems in their procurement procedures. It takes a little longer than is expected\\". While a Russian shipyard would deploy 200 workers in three shifts to complete the refit in two years, HSL deployed only 50 workers to work on Sindhukirti. After nine years in refit, Sindhukirti finally returned to sea on 23 May 2015 and is currently active. In popular culture INS Sindhukirti was featured in series 'Breaking point Indian Submariners' which was released on Veer by Discovery YouTube channel.

It should not be confused with the adjacent but separate Innu reserve of Natashquan 1. The municipality is named after the Natashquan River, which had already been mapped and named in the 17th century. It comes from the Innu language, meaning \\"where one hunts for bear\\". In addition to the village of Natashquan itself, the municipality also includes the small community of Pointe-Parent () that is located on the Natashquan River, directly adjacent to the Natashquan Reserve. It is home to some fishermen's homes and was served by a post office from 1953 to 1976. Once also known as Pointe-du-Poste and Village-du-Poste, Pointe-Parent was named after priest Pierre-Cl√©ment Parent (1733‚Äì1784) who served as missionary in Tadoussac and Labrador and died in Natashquan. Geography The community is located on the north shore of the Jacques Cartier Strait and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, straddling both banks of the Little Natashquan River, some east of Havre- Saint-Pierre. The township is bordered on the east and south by the estuary of the Natashquan River, and encompasses an area that is riddled with numerous small ponds and lakes. History The original fishermen huts (magasins du Galet) are since 2006 a Quebec cultural heritage site. While Jacques Cartier had visited the area in 1534 and a trading post already existed in 1710 at the mouth of the Natashquan River, the settlement of Natashquan in the eponymous township was not founded until 1855 when the first settlers arrived. They were Acadians from the Magdalen Islands, particularly from Amherst Island (√Æle du Havre Aubert). That same year, the Notre-Dame-de-Natashquan Mission was founded on the west bank of the Little Natashquan River. In 1869, the township was officially established, and in August 1872, the post office opened. In 1907, the place was incorporated as a township municipality. For many decades Natashquan was dependent on fishing, but nowadays few fishermen remain. On June 18, 2016, Natashquan changed status from township municipality to a (regular) municipality. Demographics =Population= =Language= Mother tongue: * English as first language: 0% * French as first language: 96.2% * English and French as first language: 0% * Other as first language: 3.8% Transport The main road through Natashquan is Quebec Route 138, and it is also served by Natashquan Airport and Natashquan (Lac de l'Avion) Water Aerodrome. Climate Natashquan experiences a borderline subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) that is just short of being classed as a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb). Summers are mild, moderated by the Gulf of St Lawrence and winters are cold and snowy, with annual snowfall averaging 140 inches (356 cm).

In normal individuals, a 25 g oral dose of D-xylose will be absorbed and excreted in the urine at approximately 4.5 g in 5 hours. A decreased urinary excretion of D-xylose is seen in conditions involving the gastrointestinal mucosa, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Whipple's disease. In cases of bacterial overgrowth, the values of D-xylose absorption return to normal after treatment with antibiotics. In contrast, if the D-xylose urinary excretion is not normal after a course of antibiotics, then the problem must be due to a non- infectious cause of malabsorption (i.e., celiac disease).

The film's working titles were Thunder in Alaska and Swift Lightning.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70105/Call-of-the-Yukon/notes.html  Plot  Adventuring author Jean Williams is living in the wilds of Alaska alongside the Eskimo people gathering material for her novel. She befriends several animals who become her loyal friends such as a pair of bear cubs whose mother has been killed by hunter Gaston Rogers, a talking raven and the bereaved collie Firefly who will not leave the grave of her master, a game warden killed in the line of duty. The community is imperiled by a pack of wolves and wild dogs, led by a wild dog called Swift Lightning, who are killing all the reindeer. With the supply of fresh meat gone, the Eskimos are migrating to lands with more food. Hunter Gaston agrees to take Jean to Nenana, Alaska, along with his furs by dog sled. Jean, who despises Gaston as being more savage and blood thirsty than the four-legged predators, is followed by her loyal animals. The pair face attacks by wolves, an avalanche and being trapped on a river whose ice floes are melting.

The 502d activated on 1 August 2009. The wing's three Mission Support Groups perform the installation support mission at each major installation in the San Antonio area. The mission of the wing is to meet the needs of all three installations of JBSA, their missions and people and to optimize installation support while maximizing opportunities for greater joint military and community cooperation. This mission is carried out through the Mission Support Group located on each JBSA base. History The 502d Air Base Wing traces it lineage back to 1947. On 17 November 1947, the Air Force organized and activated the 502d Air University Wing (502 AUW) at Maxwell Field, in Montgomery, Alabama. The Air Force, which became a separate service on two months before, initiated a re- organization program that decentralized operations and provided for easier and quicker mobility of tactical units. As part of the re-organization, the Air Force inactivated the 42d Army Air Force Base Unit, and activated the 502 AUW in its place. Personnel and equipment from the 42d transferred to the 502 AUW. Under the command of Col. William E. Covington Jr., the 502 AUW provided logistical support and base services for Air University and other base agencies on or near Maxwell Field and nearby Gunter Field. The 502 AUW performed the installation support mission for less than a year when the Air Force disestablished the wing on 27 July 1948 and established, organized and activated the 3800th Air University Wing in its place on 28 July 1948. The 3800th, under various designations, carried out the installation support mission at Maxwell and Gunter for the next 44 years. In 1992, then Air Force Chief of Staff, General Merrill A. McPeak ordered a major reorganization of the Air Force. As part of the re-organization, the general decided that all four-digit MAJCON units should be redesignated as three-digit units. Because of this, Air Training Command (ATC) consolidated the history of the 502 AUW with the now designated 3800th Air Base Wing on 1 October 1992. That same day, ATC redesignated the 3800th Air Base Wing as the 502d Air Base Wing (502 ABW). The 502 ABW continued to perform the installation support mission at Maxwell and Gunter until 1 October 1994. That day, the 502 ABW inactivated once again and the 42d Air Base Wing took over installation support for Maxwell and Gunter. On 9 November 2005, President George W. Bush endorsed the recommendations of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission and signed them into law. One of the recommendations called for the implementation of joint basing. Joint basing involved a single entity that managed the support functions of two or more adjacent DoD installations. The commission felt that combined support functions eliminated duplicated efforts and created a single efficient organization. For San Antonio, the commission recommended joint basing for the three major installations around the city; Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base, and Randolph Air Force Base. The Air Force, as the lead service for Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA), looked to one of the few wings with a history of accomplishing an installation support mission, the 502d Air Base Wing. On 1 August 2009, the 502 ABW activated once again, this time to perform the joint base administration mission. Because of its central location in San Antonio and Bexar County, Texas, the Air Force activated the wing at Fort Sam Houston. This also marked the return of a major Air Force presence to Fort Sam Houston for the first time since 1917. Unlike its prior activations, the 502 ABW did not replace a unit. The wing gradually built its staff over the next few months, while it coordinated with the support functions at Fort Sam Houston, Lackland AFB, and Randolph AFB, in anticipation of JBSA achieving Initial Operational Capability (IOC). When IOC occurred, the 502 ABW assumed the installation support mission for the three installations. On 31 January 2010, the 502 ABW took over responsibility as the host unit at Lackland and Randolph. On that day, the 12th Mission Support Group at Randolph inactivated and the 902d Mission Support Group activated in its place. Meanwhile, the 37th Mission Support Group at Lackland inactivated and the 802d Mission Support Group activated in its place. At Fort Sam Houston, the wing assumed IOC on 30 April 2010 when the 502d Mission Support Group (502 MSG) activated. The 502 MSG also provided installation support for Camp Bullis in northwestern Bexar County. The three groups and their subordinate squadrons accomplished the various installation support missions for each JBSA installation. The U.S. Army Garrison at Fort Sam Houston remained active alongside the 502 MSG until JBSA achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) on 1 October 2010. The 502 ABW became the host unit for Fort Sam Houston, Lackland AFB, and Randolph AFB. While all three installations and Camp Bullis (supported by Fort Sam Houston) make up JBSA, none share a fence line, and each maintains its historical identity.

He worked internationally as a soloist, in chamber music ensembles, and in jazz, with a repertoire from early music played on historical instruments to world premieres.  Career  Meyer studied clarinet with Otto Hermann at the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Stuttgart from 1968 to 1972, and then with Hans Deinzer at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hannover, until 1978. He studied along with his sister Sabine Meyer, with whom he also maintained a lifelong partnership professionally. In 1975, he won the ARD International Music Competition in the category chamber music with the Syrinx Quintet. Meyer played as a soloist with a focus on contemporary music, including world premieres. In 1991, Jean Fran√ßaix dedicated his Double concerto pour fl√ªte, clarinette et orchestre to flautist Dagmar Becker and Meyer. In 2008, he played the premiere of the work Levitation, which Peter E√∂tv√∂s had composed for his sister and him. He played earlier music on historical instruments, including a recording of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto with Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He was a member of the chamber music ensembles Trio di Clarone (with his sister and his brother-in-law Reiner Wehle), and the Zemlinsky Trio, and played with the Carmina Quartett and the Quatuor Mosa√Øques. Meyer was professor of clarinet at the Musikhochschule Karlsruhe from 1989 until 2016, serving as its director from 2001 to 2007. Among his students were Alexander Bader and Alison Lambert. He led masterclasses in Brazil, Canada, Finland, Italy and Japan. He often played with jazz saxophonist Peter Lehel, recording six albums. In 2009, Meyer founded an association, KlangKunst in der Hemingway Lounge, to promote concerts of different genres in Karlsruhe. He played his last concert there with Lehel on 7 February 2019. Meyer died of cancer at his home in Karlsruhe on 17 March 2019.  Recordings  Meyer recorded as a soloist and in chamber music and jazz ensembles. In 1990, he recorded Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps with violinist Christoph Poppen, cellist Manuel Fischer-Dieskau, and pianist Yvonne Loriod. In 1993, he recorded chamber music by Mozart, his Clarinet Quintet with Quatuor Mosa√Øques and the Kegelstatt Trio with violinist Anita Mitterer and pianist Patrick Cohen, using a period basset clarinet as Anton Stadler, for whom Mozart wrote the works, would have used; a reviewer of Gramophone noted his \\"very full, rounded, beautiful tone\\", \\"always perfectly tuned and with extremely light articulation.\\" In 2004, he recorded sonatas which Johannes Brahms composed for clarinet or viola, on a CD comparing the same works in both versions, with violist Pierre-Henri Xuereb and pianist . A reviewer noted that he began \\"in a measured but beautiful fashion, evidently showing all his understanding of the clarinet\\". In a 2007 collection of Mozart concertos with the Concentus Musicus Wien conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Meyer played the Clarinet Concerto. A reviewer described his \\"beautifully rounded, velvety tone\\", imaginative phrasing and capturing of the work's \\"undertow of melancholy\\".

Brown diamonds are the most common color variety of natural diamonds. In most mines, brown diamonds account for 15% of production. The brown color makes them less attractive as gemstones because of the reduced glimmer, and most are used for industrial purposes. However, improved marketing programs, especially in Australia and the United States, have resulted in brown diamonds becoming valued as gemstones and even referred to as chocolate diamonds. A significant portion of the output of Australian diamond mines is brown stones. There are several causes for the brown color, including irradiation treatment, nickel impurities and lattice defects associated with plastic deformation; the last is the predominant cause, especially in pure diamonds. A high-pressure high-temperature treatment can heal lattice defects and convert brown diamonds into yellow or even colorless stones.  Rise in popularity  Baumgold Bros., a diamond cutter and fine jewelry importer in the 1950s and 1960s, rebranded brown diamonds in order to entice sales. Names included champagne, amber, cognac, and chocolate. Other companies followed the Baumgold Bros. lead and named different shades clove, coffee, caramel, cappuccino, mocha, espresso, cinnamon and even tobacco. This rebranding had some initial success, but ultimately the massive number of names caused confusion in the marketplace. In 1986, massive amounts of brown diamonds were brought to the market. Rio Tinto opened the Argyle mine in Australia, in which 80% of the diamonds mined were brown in color. DeBeers followed this trend and in 1996 introduced massive number of brown diamonds to the market. These brown diamonds were previously only used for industrial purposes. The value of brown diamonds was hard to determine since the GIA and other third party assessors did not evaluate these diamonds. To rectify the issue, Rio Tinto created a grading system where C1 represents the lightest color and C7 represents the darkest hue. In 2000, the fine jewelry company Le Vian trademarked the term \\"chocolate diamond\\" and introduced a new brown jewelry line. Le Vian worked with the supplier Rio Tinto and partnered with the retailer, Signet Jewelers. The brand heavily advertised the 'chocolate diamond' line including a massive TV media spend. The campaign was a success; in 2007 virtually no one was searching for \\"chocolate diamonds\\", and in 2014 the number jumped to 400,000 times a year. Occurrence Diamonds occur in various colors including blue, yellow, green, orange, various shades of pink and red, brown, gray and black. Before the development of the Argyle diamond mine in Australia in 1986, most brown diamonds were considered worthless for jewelry; they were not even assessed on the diamond color scale, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes. However, marketing strategies changed in the 1980s and brown diamonds have become popular gems. The change was mostly due to supply: the Argyle mine, with its 35 million carats (7,000 kg) of diamonds per year, makes about one third of global production of natural diamonds; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown. The percentage of brown diamonds is lower in other mines, but it is almost always a significant part of the total production. Consequently, scientific research has intensified on causes of brown color in diamond and ways to alter it. Notable brown diamonds *The Golden Jubilee Diamond is the largest cut diamond in the world. It was found in 1985 as a rough stone of 755.5 carats (151 g) in the Premier mine in South Africa, which is operated by De Beers. The stone was cut into a 545.67-carat (109.13 g) and was purchased from De Beers by a group of businessmen led by Henry Ho of Thailand in 1995. The Golden Jubilee Diamond was named by King Bhumibol Adulyadej and given to him on occasion of his 50th coronation anniversary. *The Earth Star Diamond was found at another South African mine of De Beers, the Jagersfontein Mine on May 16, 1967. The diamond came from the 2,500-foot (760 m) level of the volcanic diamond-bearing pipe. The rough gem weighed and was cut into a pear- shaped gem with a strong brown color and extraordinary brilliance. The diamond was bought in 1983 for $900,000. *The Star of the South (the original name was Portuguese \\"Estrela do Sul\\") is one of the largest diamonds found in Brazil and the first Brazilian diamond to receive international acclaim. The original rough stone was found in 1853 by an African slave woman, for which she received her freedom and life pension. The diamond was cut into a cushion shaped gem weighing . For a long time, the Star of the South was considered to be \\"by far the largest diamond discovered by any woman anywhere\\", until the Incomparable Diamond was discovered in the 1980s. The diamond has a color grade of Fancy Light Pinkish-Brown. *The Incomparable Diamond is another African diamond, one of the largest ever found in the world (). In 1984, a young girl discovered it in a pile of rubble from old mine dumps of the nearby MIBA Diamond Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rubble had been discarded during the recovery process because it had been considered too bulky to contain diamonds. Before cutting, the stone was the largest brown diamond and the fourth largest diamond of any color ever discovered after the Cullinan (), Excelsior Diamond () and Star of Sierra Leone (). The massive diamond's owners initially planned to cut it into the world's largest gem. However, the diamond's final size was reduced to in order to reduce the number of internal flaws. Nevertheless, it was the 3rd largest cut diamond after the Cullinan I and Golden Jubilee Diamonds. The stone was cut by a team led by Marvin Samuels, who co-owned the stone along with Donald Zale of Zales Jewellers and Louis Glick. In November 1984 the finished stones were put on display: a single golden diamond of in a 'triolette' shape, and fourteen additional gems. Notably, the satellite stones cut from the Incomparable varied greatly in color, from near-colorless to rich yellow-brown. The largest of these stones still bears the name 'Incomparable Diamond', and was graded by the GIA as internally flawless in 1988. *The Lesotho Brown was unearthed at the Letseng diamond mine in Lesotho in 1967 at Letseng-la-Terai by Ernestine Ramaboa. The rough stone weighed and was cut in 1968 into 18 polished diamonds totaling . The largest was a emerald cut known as the Lesotho I. The Lesotho III (the third largest stone cut from the crystal) is a marquise-shaped gem that was once owned by Jackie Kennedy, given to her by her husband Aristotle Onassis as an engagement ring. It was mounted in a platinum ring created by Harry Winston. The ring had an estimated value of $600,000 US, but at the Jackie Kennedy estate sale auction in April 1996 it reached a price of $2,587,500 US dollars. The Lesotho I was offered at Sotheby's, Geneva on November 19, 2008 as part of a Magnificent Jewels sale, but it did not sell. Its value was estimated before the sale to be 3,360,000 to 5,600,000 Swiss francs, which equated to $2,783,894 to $4,639,824 US dollars. The lot's description mentioned it was being offered for sale by the same owner who had originally bought it from Harry Winston around 1969. It also listed the gem as having a clarity of VVS2, excellent polish and excellent symmetry, and, although the stone (and the other Lesotho fragments) is a pale brown color, no color grade is mentioned in the auction text. *In 1974, Elizabeth Taylor wore a cognac diamond ring and earrings to the Oscars. The jewelry was a gift from Richard Burton for their tenth anniversary. Causes of color =Irradiation= Pure diamonds, before and after irradiation and annealing. Clockwise from left bottom: 1) Initial (2√ó2 mm) 2‚Äì4) Irradiated by different doses of 2-MeV electrons 5‚Äì6) Irradiated by different doses and annealed at 800 ¬∞C. Irradiation of diamond by high-energy particles (electrons, ions, neutrons or gamma rays) produces vacancies in the diamond lattice by ejecting carbon atoms. Those vacancies produce green color centers in pure transparent diamond and yellow-green color in yellow diamonds. The color of yellow diamonds results from small numbers of nitrogen atoms replacing carbon in the lattice. Heating the irradiated diamonds to temperatures above 600 ¬∞C results in brown color associated with aggregation of the vacancies, with or without nitrogen involved. Such irradiation and annealing treatment can occur in nature because diamonds are often accompanied by uranium-containing ores which emit alpha particles. However, the thus produced color is restricted to a thin surface layer of few micrometers. Homogeneous color can be produced if the treatment is performed artificially, using electrons, neutrons or gamma-rays. Radiation treatment induces characteristic sharp optical absorption lines which can be easily detected by spectroscopic techniques. =Brown synthetic diamonds= Synthetic diamonds created by compressing graphite to several gigapascals and heating to temperatures above 1500 ¬∞C are usually rich in nitrogen. Nitrogen in those diamonds is dispersed through the lattice as single atoms and induces yellow color. Nickel is often added to graphite to accelerate its conversion into diamond. Incorporation of nickel and nitrogen into diamond induces brown color. Nickel is easily detectable by characteristic, sharp optical absorption and luminescence signals making such diamonds easily identifiable. =Natural brown diamonds= Whereas the brown color due to irradiation or nickel impurity can be easily recognized through spectroscopic (e.g. absorption) measurements, the majority of natural brown diamonds do not show any characteristic absorption peaks. Whereas the consensus has been reached that the color relates to the plastic deformation, the particular reason has been reliably identified (large clusters of vacancies) only in type IIa natural brown diamond. Other recent results suggest that these large clusters of vacancies (mini-voids) are a likely cause in other types of diamond as well. Those lattice defects are most likely responsible for the color of the notable diamonds described above. =Heat-treated brown diamonds= The concept that brown color might be related to lattice imperfections has led to a technique to convert brown diamonds into more valued light-yellow or even colorless ones: the diamond is subjected to high pressures of 6‚Äì10 GPa and temperatures above 1600 ¬∞C that heals (anneals) those defects. The technique has been demonstrated in several research laboratories in Russia and the United States. In March 1999, Pegasus Overseas Ltd (POL) from Antwerp, Belgium, a subsidiary of Lazare Kaplan International, started marketing such diamonds that were processed by General Electric (GE). Those diamonds therefore received the name GE POL (or GEPOL) and were marketed in the US as Bellataire diamonds. The existence and identity of the treatment process was considered so important that micrometer-sized letters \\"GEPOL\\" were inscribed with a laser on the girdles of every treated diamond. In 2004, however, the GE diamond section was purchased by Littlejohn & Co. and renamed Diamond Innovations. Since 1999, several companies around the world have adopted the technique and use various brand names for the processed diamonds.

The species was first described by George Robert Gray in 1833. Description Ctenomorphodes chronus next to matchstick to show scale Ctenomorphodes Chronus Stick Insect (Sydney) C. chronus resembles a eucalyptus twig and can grow up to 20 cm in length.Hasenpusch, J. & Brock, P. D. (2006). Studies on the Australian Stick Insect Genus Ctenomorpha Gray (Phasmida: Phasmatidae: Phasmatinae), With The Description of a New Large Species in Zootaxa The males are long and slender, have full wings and can fly. The females are larger with blackish hindwings. The wings of the females are smaller than those of the males. The legs and head (prothorax) are light pinkish brown, with the legs being dentated. The mesothorax, tegmina, abdomen and leaflets, are all blackish green. The mesothorax may have small tubercles. The abdomen contains numerous small spots. The cerci are extremely long and may be somewhat dentated. The nymphs are similar to the older stage, but with only small wing buds instead of the full-length wings of the adults. This species can be distinguished from other members of the family by their extremely long cerci and by the appearance of their eggs. Distribution and habitat This species is quite common in heaths and woodlands from southern Queensland south to Victoria, but prefers coastal environments. Reproduction The female lays 3 mm elliptical eggs that look like plant seeds. Like most phasmids, C. chronus flicks its eggs on the soil, where a little knob called the capitullum attracts ants to carry them to the ant refinery, where they hatch. This species is parthenogenetic. Ecology C. chronus feeds on leaves from the eucalyptus tree as well as other tree species. It is a twig mimic, its body shape and colouration making it well camouflaged among eucalyptus twigs. See also * Phasmatodea Further reading * Balderson, J., Rentz, D.C.F. and Roach, A.M.E.

Life and career Pieterson suffered from asthma as a child, and began studies of clarinet at age 11 to try to counteract this condition. He studied clarinet with his uncle, Jos d'Hondt. As a teenager and student at the Amsterdams Muzieklyceum, Pieterson was a member of the Aulos Quintet, which included Martine Bakker (flute), Edo de Waart (oboe), Joep Terweij (bassoon) and Jaap Verhaar (French horn), under the guidance of Thom de Klerk.

From its headwaters in the Bitterroot Mountains of eastern Idaho, it flows U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 3, 2011 westward and is dammed by the Dworshak Dam just above its mouth in north-central Idaho. Draining a rugged watershed of , the river has an average flow of over , accounting for a third of the discharge from the Clearwater basin. The river drains parts of Clearwater, Shoshone, Latah, and Idaho counties. Most of the watershed is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Some of the fish of the river include westslope cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and the threatened bull trout. It also has smallmouth bass and a kokanee salmon run, both from Dworshak Reservoir. The North Fork drainage is home to grizzly bears, cougars, deer, moose, black bear, elk, grey wolves, and osprey. The river used to have a large steelhead run before the implementation of Dworshak Dam. The North Fork of the Clearwater is located within the Clearwater National Forest Course It rises in the Bitterroot Mountains, which form the far eastern border of the State of Idaho, on the Idaho-Montana border. The headwaters are on the south flank of the triple summits of Graves Peak, Illinois Peak and Gold Crown Peak, very near St. Joe Lake, the head waters of the St. Joe River, which flows into Coeur d'Alene Lake. The river immediately flows southwest through a narrow gorge, joined by numerous small tributaries. The river turns southeast to join with Long Creek and Lake Creek, which flow in from the east. After joining these two large creeks, the river turns west, then receives Elizabeth Creek from the right as it veers to the south. Then it turns sharply west into a wider valley, where it receives its largest tributary thus far, Kelly Creek,Robbins, p. 65. from the left near an unincorporated community, and turns west and southwest, paralleled by Forest Service Road #250. It then receives 4 July Creek from the left, Weitas Creek from the left, Orogrande Creek from the left and Quartz Creek from the right. Flowing northeast then swinging back west, the river receives Skull Creek from the northeast just downstream of the Quartz Creek confluence. Beaver Creek enters from the south and Isabella Creek from the north. With high buttes towering to the north and comparatively gradual mountains rising on the south, the river enters Dworshak Reservoir, formed by the massive Dworshak Dam.Benke and Cushing, p. 632 About later, the flooded canyon meets the canyon of the Little North Fork Clearwater River on the right, which is also flooded for some distance. Still narrow and winding, following the river's original course, the reservoir branches to the south and spreads wider as it enters more gradual terrain. Reeds Creek and Elk Creek, formerly major tributaries of the river, now flow directly into the lake. The reservoir then ends at the Dworshak Dam, a high concrete gravity dam. Below the dam the river runs southeast for a little over a mile, crosses under Idaho State Route 7, and meets the Clearwater River at Ahsahka. Watershed The North Fork Clearwater's watershed covers of land in the lower Idaho Panhandle. The watershed is approximately 26.6 percent of the Clearwater River watershed, itself a tributary of the Snake River. The drainage area of the St. Joe River abuts the North Fork drainage to the north, Latah Creek to the northeast, the Middle Fork Clearwater to the east and south, the South Fork Clearwater and Snake River to the south, and the Potlatch River and Clearwater to the west. The basin is very lightly populated - the largest and only incorporated town is Elk River, Idaho, population 149. The logging industry makes up the primary economy of the North Fork's watershed. The major tributaries to the North Fork Clearwater River are (proceeding downstream) Kelly Creek, the Little North Fork Clearwater River, and Elk Creek. On average, streamflow in the North Fork is approximately , ranging from to over . The USGS operated a stream gauge near the mouth of the river from 1927 to 1968. In that time period, the highest recorded flow was on December 23, 1933. The lowest peak was on 18 May 1941. *Graphs for peak discharge at this site See also *List of Idaho rivers *List of longest streams of Idaho References Works cited *Benke, Arthur C.; Cushing, Colbert E.

Its programming is generalist with a strong focus on highbrow and Korean-oriented programming, ranging from news and current affairs, cultural programming, sports coverage, entertainment series, drama, talkshows and children's programming.  History  KBS TV began broadcasting on 31 December 1961, as South Korea's first full-scale television station. Regular broadcasts commenced on 15 January the following year. KBS1 was once known for being one of the first commercial TV stations in South Korea. But in 1963, the South Korean government through its parliament, introduced the Television License Fee system. Advertisements on KBS1 were abolished in 1994. The monopoly was broken in 1965 when TBC began broadcasting. In December 1980, following KBS's acquisition of various private broadcasters, including the forced merger with TBC, it became known as KBS1. KBS 1TV began 24-hour broadcasting on 8 October 2012, the first channel in South Korea to do so, in line with the digital switchover and following the lifting the ban of broadcasting into the early hours of the morning on terrestrial television. Even though KBS1 is 24 hours, they continue closing down on Sunday and Monday nights, due to technical maintenance. As of 2018, KBS1 is the only channel to maintain its late night offerings after its rival stations MBC TV and SBS TV discontinued their 24-hour offerings and resumed closing down on a nightly basis in 2017. Programming In contrast to its sister channel KBS2, which focuses on entertainment, TV series, movies and sports, KBS 1TV is the home of predominantly the news, current affairs, cultural and documentary programming being produced by KBS, as well as primetime drama miniseries and weekend historical and literature series. It also acts as the principal channel for breaking news or live events of national and international significance. It also airs musical shows, children's programming, more regional programming and selected sports coverage if KBS2 is unable to broadcast them live. All KBS 2TV dramas are also shown on this channel as reruns, notably the Monday/Tuesday dramas & Wednesday/Thursday dramas. KBS 1TV has musical variety shows, but unlike its sister channel, KBS 2TV and most commercial stations which air it on a live basis, most KBS 1TV musical shows are either recorded or broadcast live on special occasions. The only live music program shown on this channel is the National Singing Contest (also known as Korea Sings), a talent show currently shown since 1980.

For example John Burke states he was the 7th baron while Charles Firth states he was the 6th (, ). was a Parliamentary supporter during the English Civil War and was the only peer created before the Interregnum to sit in Cromwell's Upper House. Lord George inherited the title from his cousin William Eure, 6th Baron Eure, a colonel in the Royalist army who died fighting at the Battle of Marston Moor. Mark Noble suggests that as Lord George was not wealthy, he chose the side which was evidently the most powerful. Though he was a peer of the realm, he did not think it beneath him, to sit in the house of commons, as a member for Yorkshire, he accepted a nomination to the Barebones Parliament called by Oliver Cromwell in 1653, and was elected to parliament for the East Riding of that county in the First Protectorate Parliament 1654, and he was elected in 1656 as an MP to the North Riding for the Second Protectorate Parliament. Cromwell, therefore, could not do less than place Eure in his house of lords; he long survived the restoration, and sat in the restored House of Lords. George Eure died a bachelor in 1672; and was succeeded by his brother Ralph, lord Eure, who joined with the Duke of Monmouth, and others, in petitioning Charles II against the Roman Catholics in, 1680-1; and, Mark Noble thought, was one of those who had the courage to present James Duke of York, as a popish recusant. With Ralph's death, without issue, in 1690, the title became extinct. Another of the brothers was Samual Eure, esq. a colonel in the royal army, and a compounder upon that account for his estate. A relation of theirs was Isaac Eure (Ewer), esq. who was colonel in the parliamentary army, and was sent to conduct King Charles I from the Isle of Wight to Hurst Castle, named one of the commissioners to sit in judgment upon his sovereign, which he did, and signed the warrant for his execution; was one of those who were sent, in 1649 to Ireland. Happily for himself, he died before the restoration, but at that time his estates were confiscated.

Overview and Assumptions In 4CAPS computations are distributed and dynamically balanced among independent processing centers. Like in other cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R), these processing centers have been identified with corresponding cortical regions in the human brain. Performing specific task, such as reading or driving, requires the simultaneous contribution of many of such regions. Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers. In particular, according to Just and Varma, 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions: # Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions # Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources # The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated. # Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels. Implementation and Applications Like other cognitive architectures (such as ACT-R, EPIC, and Soar), 4CAPS is implemented as a production system. It is written in the Common Lisp programming language.The source code for 4CAPS can be found at http://www.ccbi.cmu.edu/4CAPS/index.html This system has been used to create computational models for a variety of phenomena, especially in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In particular, 4CAPS models have been created and used to fit behavioral and imaging data for tasks such as the Tower of London,Newman, S. D., Carpenter, P. A., Varma, S., & Just, M. A. (2003).

It provides banking services to the Stanford community. Stanford FCU has over $3.3 billion in assets and serves over 74,000 members. Stanford FCU is the third fastest growing credit union in California by share growth. History Stanford Federal Credit Union was created by a group of Stanford University employees on December 17, 1959. Its original field of membership was limited to employees of the university. The credit union opened in 1960 with $261 in deposits and established its first office in Encina Hall on Stanford University‚Äôs campus. In 1985, Stanford Federal Credit Union expanded its field of membership to include Stanford University students and members and employees of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce. In 2004, the credit union opened its membership to members of the Friends of Palo Alto Libraries (FOPAL). Today, Stanford Federal Credit Union also serves numerous company partners, including Google, VMware, Facebook, Tesla, SAP and more. =Expansion of Services= The credit union became one of the first to offer checking accounts and credit cards in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, it introduced ATMs and banking by telephone. In November 1993, Stanford Federal Credit Union conducted its first four internet transactions; and in 1994, it became the first financial institution to offer online banking when it launched its website; it offered online BillPay to its members in 1997, added account aggregation and mobile banking in 2002, and became one of the first institutions to implement the Passmark authentication system in 2005. In 2007, Stanford FCU joined the CO-OP network to provide its members with over 30,000 surcharge-free ATMs worldwide. Membership Any member of the Stanford community may join Stanford Federal Credit Union, including students and employees of Stanford University, employees of Stanford Health Care, Stanford Children‚Äôs Health, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The credit union‚Äôs field of membership also extends to the following: * Companies that are located on Stanford-owned lands * Members, employees, and volunteers of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce * Employees of member companies of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce * Employees of select member companies, including Google, VMware, Facebook, Tesla and SAP. * Members, employees, and volunteers of the Friends of Palo Alto Libraries (FOPAL) * Members, employees, and volunteers of the Museum of American Heritage (MOAH) Organization Stanford Federal Credit Union is chartered by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) as a federally insured credit union. It is led by a Board of Directors that is elected by the credit union‚Äôs members and serves without pay. Products and services Stanford Federal Credit Union offers a range of financial services, including consumer and business accounts and loans. Financial tools and services in the form of seminars, online calculators, and financial counseling are also available to both consumer and business members of the credit union. The credit union has five branch locations and maintains twenty-four ATMs around the Stanford University campus and Palo Alto, California. As a member of the CO-OP Network since 2007, Stanford Federal Credit Union also has access to over 30,000 additional surcharge-free ATMs. Subsidiary In 1997, Stanford Federal Credit Union announced the creation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cardinal Services Corporation (CSC). The corporation focused on licensing software and supporting Internet development for businesses. Cardinal Services Corporation operated as a Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO). CUSOs were established by the NCUA as a way for credit unions to conduct business that they would otherwise be restricted from.

Its species name 'Occidentale' means 'westernmost' and refers to its location along the West Coast. It is native to northwestern California and southwestern Oregon.Center for Plant Conservation Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapCalflora taxon report, Lilium occidentale Purdy western lily It grows in coastal prairie habitat, swamps and stagnant bogs with Drosera species, bluffs and sandy cliffs, and seaside spruce forests. This rare wildflower is limited in distribution and directly endangered by a number of environmental factors. It is a federally listed endangered species and it is listed as endangered by the states of California and Oregon. It is found growing along a narrow 200 mile stretch of coast between Southern Oregon and Northern California usually within sight of the ocean. Its furthest northern distribution is Florence, Oregon to as far south as Eureka, California. Lilium occidentale is a perennial herb sometimes exceeding two meters in height. It grows from a scaly, elongated bulb which may be nearly 10 centimeters long. The leaves grow in a series of whorls around the stem. They may be linear to oval in shape and over 20 centimeters long. The inflorescence bears up to 35 showy nodding lily flowers. The flower has 6 recurved tepals each up to 8 centimeters long, sometimes curled back into complete rings. The tepals are usually red to orange to yellow-green, generally bicolored with more red on the inside and more greenish yellow on the outer surfaces. They are often spotted. There are six stamens with large red anthers up to 1.4 centimeters long, and a pistil which may be more than 5 centimeters in length. The flower is pollinated chiefly by hummingbirds, including Allen's hummingbird (Selasphorus sasin).Flora of North America Threats to this species have included grazing and trampling by livestock, development and ranching, cranberry farming, genetic drift, vehicles and road maintenance, and horticultural collecting of the bulbs and flowers. New sprouts and shoots dry out quickly and are easily crushed. The invasion of trees into the plant's habitat, either by natural succession or deliberate planting and fire suppression, can alter the hydrology and soil structure enough to eliminate it. When the plant was listed as an endangered species in 1994, there were 2000 to 3000 individuals remaining.FWS. Determination of Endangered Status for Lilium occidentale. Federal Register August 17, 1994. Lilium occidental grows easily from seed with stratification. It can be easily grown in an artificial type bog or other wetland setting providing its need for constant moisture during the growing season is met. (McRae). There is considerable hybridization with other native lilies, in particular L. columbianum, in areas where the two species grow in close proximity. At some locations the two species grow side by side, with Occidentale growing in low depressions (drainage ditches) that are clearly flooded during wet periods or periods of heavy rain, and columbianum growing just feet away on the steeper slope.(McRae). This leads to confusion with regards to \\"true\\" phenotype. One home owner near Eureka, California had literally hundreds growing in his garden. Regardless of its realitive easy of culture, Lilium occIdentale is a federally protected species under the Endangered Species Act and C.I.T.E.S (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and therefore it is illegal to own or process any plant material (seed, bulbs, leaves, ETC), or sell seed or bulbs without proper documentation and approval of U.S. Fish & Wildlife. Violators face prosecution and a possible felony conviction for possession of undocumented plant material. Occidentale produces more nectar than any other American lily, which is not surprising given that hummingbirds are the primary pollinator.

Historical background French is a Romance language descended primarily from the Gallo-Roman language, a form of Vulgar Latin, spoken in the late Roman Empire by the Gauls and more specifically the Belgae. However, northern Gaul from the Rhine southward to the Loire starting in the 3rd century was gradually co-populated by a Germanic confederacy, the Franks, culminating after the departure of the Roman administration in a re-unification by the first Christian king of the Franks, Clovis I, in AD 486. From the name of his domain, Francia (which covered northern France, the lowlands and much of Germany), comes the modern name, France. For a few centuries, sizeable minorities of Frankish speaking peasants held on to their native language, but in northern France they shifted to their own dialect of Gallo-Roman.. The first Franks spoke Frankish, a Western Germanic language. As the Frankish Kingdom expanded under the reigns of Charles Martel and Pepin the Short, becoming the earliest Holy Roman Empire under Charlemagne, the common language differentiated into a number of mutually incomprehensible languages of Europe. The main division was between High German and Low German. The dividing zone was the Rhenish Fan. The Ripuarian and Carolingian Franks came to speak a form of Old High German. The Salian Franks spoke Old Frankish or Old Franconian, which later evolved into Old Dutch. The Franks in northern Gaul adopted their own version of Gallo- Roman, which became French. France emerged after the heirs of Charlemagne divided the empire along linguistic lines. In France, Germanic language continued to be spoken among the kings and nobility until the time of the Capetian Kings (10th century).Wise, The vocabulary of modern French: origins, structure and function, pg 35. Hugh Capet (AD 987), born to a Saxon mother, was reportedly the first King of France to need an interpreter when addressed by envoys from Frankish Germany. Generally, Frankish nobles of the Carolingian dynasty were bilingual in Frankish and Gallo-Romance. The Neustrian army had received orders in Gallo-Romance since the time of the Oaths of Strasbourg. The situation was not unlike the one in England after the Norman Conquest, with Frankish nobility occupying the role of superstratum language over the existing Proto-Romance language spoken by the populace. The development of French As a result of over 500 years of Germano-Latin bilingualism, many Germanic words became ingrafted into the Gallo-Romance speech by the time it emerged as Old French in AD 900. And after the Franks abandoned Frankish, the Old French they spoke tended to be heavily Frankish influenced, with a distinctively Frankish accent, which introduced new phonemes, stress-timing, Germanic grammatical and syntactical elements, and contained many more Germanic loans not found in the Old French spoken by the native Gallo-Romans. Even though the Franks were largely outnumbered by the Gallo-Roman population, the position of the Franks as leaders and landholders lent their version of Old French a greater power of influence over that of the Gallo-Romans; it thereby became the basis of later versions of the French language, including Modern French (see Francien language). It is for this reason that Modern French pronunciation has a rather distinct and undeniably \\"Germanic\\" sound when compared to other Romance languages, such as Italian and Spanish, and is a major contributing factor in why there exists a distinction between Northern French varieties spoken in regions where Frankish settlement was heavy (langue d'o√Øl) vs. those where Frankish settlement was relatively slight (langue d'oc).Price, The French language: present and past, pg 11. Although approximately ten percent of Modern French words are derived from Frankish,Nadeau, Barlow, The Story of French, pg 24. Frankish was not the only source of Germanic words in French. Gothic languages, like Burgundian, made contributions (via Proven√ßal), as did Old Norse and Old English via Norman French. Other words were borrowed directly from Old, Middle and Modern versions of Dutch and German, and still others came through the Germanic elements found in Latin (particularly Medieval Latin) and other Romance languages, like Walloon, Italian, and Spanish. Finally, Modern English has made contributions to the French lexicon, most notably within the past few decades. Scope of the dictionary The following list details words, affixes and phrases that contain Germanic etymons. Words where only an affix is Germanic (e.g. m√©fait, bouillard, carnavalesque) are excluded, as are words borrowed from a Germanic language where the origin is other than Germanic (for instance, cabaret is from Dutch, but the Dutch word is ultimately from Latin/Greek, so it is omitted). Likewise, words which have been calqued from a Germanic tongue (e.g. pardonner, bienvenue, entreprendre, toujours, compagnon, plupart, manuscrit, manoeuvre), or which received their usage or sense (i.e. were created, modified or influenced) due to Germanic speakers or Germanic linguistic habits (e.g. comt√©, avec, commun, on, panne, avoir, √ßa) are not included. Many other Germanic words found in older versions of French, such as Old French and Anglo-French are no longer extant in Standard Modern French. Many of these words do, however, continue to survive dialectally and in English. See: List of English Latinates of Germanic origin.

She participated in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, where she played a key role in patrol missions. She later participated in naval exercises with other nations and made many goodwill visits to other countries.

The complement is about 75, including 8 officers and 67 sailors. Telegraph dials aboard the submarine The submarine has three shafts, each with a six-blade propeller. She is powered by three Kolomna 2D42M diesel engines, each with . She also has three electric motors, two of them with and one with . She can achieve a maximum speed of when on surface, when submerged and while snorkelling. She has a range of at when surfaced and at when submerged. There are 10 torpedo tubes to carry 22 Type 53 torpedoes. She could lay 44 mines instead of torpedoes. She also had a snoop tray and I-Band radar for surface search. Operational history Kursura was commissioned on 18 December 1969 at Riga, Soviet Union. She was India's fourth submarine. Kursura's first commander was Commander A Auditto. She began her maiden voyage to India on 20 February 1970. During her homecoming voyage, which lasted from February to April 1970, she visited G√∂teborg, La Coru√±a, Takoradi and Mauritius. Kursura, along with sister boat , were made operational under the Indian Navy's Western Naval Command, and reported to the Flag officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command (FOCINCWEST). They were ordered to patrol approaches to Pakistan's Karachi harbour and Makran Coast, for which they established waiting stations and submarine havens. In 1970, Karanj was badly damaged after a collision with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship. As no drawings of the damaged portions of the boat were available with the Bombay Dockyard or the Indian Navy, it was decided to use Kursura, which was already docked at Bombay, as the design template for the metal work, and Karanj was repaired within months, in time to join the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. =Indo-Pakistan War of 1971= During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura operated in the Arabian Sea. She was given the patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance. She started from her home port on 13 November 1971 and reached her patrol location by 18 November. She remained there until 25 November when she was shifted to a new patrol location and remained there until 30 November. On 30 November, she rendezvoused with Karanj at sea to transfer instructions and subsequently then left for Bombay and reached there by 4 December 1971. During her patrols, she encountered fair weather and monitored a number of tankers and commercial aircraft flying on international routes. She was originally intended to lay mines but the plan was later cancelled. =Later service= Kursura was used for test firing the NSTL 58 torpedo in 1975. She was laid off for many years to be cannibalised for spare parts for other submarines, but underwent a refit in the Soviet Union between September 1980 and April 1982, and was made operational again in 1985. Along with , she participated in the first anti-submarine warfare(ASW) training exercise with the RSS Victory of Singapore off the coast of Port Blair between 21‚Äì24 February 1994. She participated in the second ASW exercise with Singapore along with , RSS Valour and RSS Vigilance. She visited Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia, in December 1994 on a good-will visit. After a service of 31 years and traversing , she was decommissioned on 27 February 2001.

Museum ship (2002 ‚Äì present) Kursura as a museum ship in Visakhapatnam Kursura undergoing repairs in 2013 After decommissioning, the ship was towed to RK Beach in Visakhapatnam and was established as a museum ship, which is the first submarine museum in South Asia. The idea of the boat's conversion to a museum is credited to Admiral V Pasricha. Towing the submarine 600 metres to its final location took 18 months and cost 55 million. It was inaugurated on 9 August 2002, and it was open to the public from 24 August 2002. Six retired naval personnel serve as guides and another one as the curator. Kursura has the distinction of being one of the very few submarine museums to retain originality. She has become a famous tourist attraction of the city and has been called a \\"must-visit destination\\" of Visakhapatnam by The Hindu. Out of the 10 million revenue generated every year by the museum, 8 million is used for the submarine's maintenance. During the first four months of the museum's operation, it was visited by about 93,000 people. Daily visitors usually range between 500 and 600 and shoot up to 1,500 during the tourist season. In September 2007, Vice Admiral Carol M. Pottenger of the United States Navy visited the submarine when she wrote in the guestbook \\"What a fantastic experience. The Indian Navy should be very proud of this awesome display\\". She said that the submarine was very well preserved and they did not have anything similar to it in the United States.

Today, taxonomic databases are routinely used for the automated construction of biological checklists such as floras and faunas, both for print publication and online; to underpin the operation of web based species information systems; as a part of biological collection management (for example in museums and herbaria); as well as providing, in some cases, the taxon management component of broader science or biology information systems. They are also a fundamental contribution to the discipline of biodiversity informatics.  Goal  The goal of a taxonomic database is (or should be) to accurately model the characteristics of interest that are relevant to the organisms which are in scope for the intended coverage and usage of the system. For example, databases of fungi, algae, bryophytes and higher plants would need to encode conventions from the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature while their counterparts for animals and most protists would encode equivalent rules from the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature; in both cases modelling the relevant taxonomic hierarchy for any taxon is a natural fit with the relational model employed in almost all database systems. In addition to encoding organism identifiers (most frequently a combination of scientific name, author, and - for zoological taxa - year of original publication), a taxonomic database may frequently incorporate additional taxonomic information such as synonyms and taxonomic opinions, literature sources or citations, plus a range of biological of attributes as desired for each taxon such as geographic distribution, ecology, descriptive information, threatened or vulnerable status, etc.  History  Possibly the earliest documented management of taxonomic information in computerised form comprised the taxonomic coding system developed by Richard Swartz et al. at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science for the Biota of Chesapeake Bay and described in a published report in 1972. This work led directly or indirectly to other projects with greater profile including the NODC Taxonomic Code system which went through 8 versions before being discontinued in 1996, to be subsumed and transformed into the still current Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). A number of other taxonomic databases specializing in particular groups of organisms that appeared in the 1970s through to the present jointly contribute to the Species 2000 project, which since 2001 has been partnering with ITIS to produce a combined product, the Catalogue of Life. While the Catalogue of Life currently concentrates on assembling basic name information as a global species checklist, numerous other taxonomic database projects such as Fauna Europaea, the Australian Faunal Directory, and more supply rich ancillary information including descriptions, illustrations, maps, and more. Many taxonomic database projects are currently listed at the TDWG \\"Biodiversity Information Projects of the World\\" site.  Issues  The representation of taxonomic information in machine-encodable form raises a number of issues not encountered in other domains, such as variant ways to cite the same species or other taxon name, the same name used for multiple taxa (homonyms), multiple non-current names for the same taxon (synonyms), changes in name and taxon concept definition through time, and more. One forum that has promoted discussion and possible solutions to these and related problems since 1985 is the Taxonomic Database Working Group.

Inspired by the White City and Midway Plaisance sections of the World's Columbian Exhibition of 1893, the parks started gaining in popularity in the last few years of the 19th century. After the 1901 Pan-American Exposition inspired the first Luna Park in Coney Island, a frenzy in building amusement parks (including those to be named White City, Luna Park, and Electric Park) ensued in the first two decades of the 20th century. Like their Luna Park and Electric Park cousins, a typical White City park featured a shoot-the-chutes and lagoon, a roller coaster (usually a figure eight or a mountain railway), a midway, a Ferris wheel, games, and a pavilion. Some White City parks featured miniature railroads. Many cities had two (or all three) of the Electric Park/Luna Park/White City triumvirate in their vicinity... with each trying to outdo the others with new attractions. The competition was fierce, often driving the electric parks out of business due to increased cost due to equipment upgrades and upkeep and increasing insurance costs. More than a few succumbed to fire. Only one park that was given the White City name continues to operate today: Denver's White City, opened in 1908, is currently Lakeside Amusement Park. Origin White City of the World's Columbian Exposition (1893) The enormously successful 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago attracted 26 million visitors and featured a section that is now commonly considered the first amusement park: a midway (the mile-long Midway Plaisance), the world's first Ferris wheel (constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr.), a forerunner of the modern roller coaster (Thomas Rankin's Snow and Ice Railway, later moved to Coney Island),Robert Cartmell, The American Scream Machine: A History of the Roller Coaster (Popular Press 1987) lighting and attractions powered by alternating current (Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti had completed the first power plant with AC power in London just the year before), and the debut of several kinds of foods in the United States, including hamburgers, shredded wheat, Cracker Jack, Juicy Fruit chewing gum, and pancakes made using Aunt Jemima pancake mix. The Zoopraxographical Hall was the first commercial theater. Ragtime composed and performed by Scott Joplin exposed millions of people to a new form of music and instantly became a staple for fairs and carnivals.Richard Crawford, America's Musical Life: A History (W. W. Norton & Company 2001) Ferris wheel at the World's Columbian Exposition. White City can be seen behind it and to the right. While the Midway Plaisance became the Exposition's main drawing card, it was not the primary purpose of the World's Fair in the eyes of its founders, who pictured it to be the beginning of a classical renaissance featuring electrically-lit white stucco buildings (collectively known as White City) occupying the main court. While White City gave the park its visual identity, the throngs who attended the Columbian Exposition tended to collect at the Midway Plaisance (and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which set up shop just outside the park grounds after the fair's founders rejected Buffalo Bill Cody's attempt to become an official Columbian Exhibition exhibitor). The World's Fair was destined to be remembered primarily for two ironic visions, that of the crowds at the Midway Plaisance (which essentially was the first modern amusement park with its entertainment, including exhibitions of boxer John L. Sullivan and exotic dancer Little Egypt, its games and its rides) and the architecture of the (far less popular) White City. Much of the Midway Plaisance reappeared in Coney Island's Steeplechase Park by the end of 1897 (but not the Ferris wheel, which had been committed to the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis: a smaller version was built and installed in Paul Boyton's Steeplechase Park instead... along with a sign that stated \\"On this site will be erected the world's largest Ferris Wheel\\"). While Steeplechase Park eventually became one of the earliest embodiments of an amusement park, Chicago had one to replace Midway Plaisance a year after the close of the Columbian Exposition, Paul Boyton's Water Chutes, featuring a shoot-the-chutes ride that wasn't present in the Columbian Exposition, but would soon become a staple of amusement parks to come.Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of New Jersey (Stackpole Books 2004) Paul Boyton's Water Chutes was the first amusement to charge admission when it opened in 1894; inspired by the immediate success of his Chicago park (500,000 people visiting it in its first year of operation), he moved (and expanded) Water Chutes in 1896, a year after he started the similar Sea Lion Park in Coney Island.Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of New York (Stackpole Books 2006) Foretelling a fate similar to most amusement parks that followed, Paul Boyton's Water Chutes went out of business in 1908, in the face of increasing competition, mainly exhibition parks inspired by the Columbian Exposition in Chicago (\\"White City\\") and the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo (\\"Luna Park\\") and the emergence of trolley parks owned and operated by railroads and electric companies (\\"Electric Park\\"). In 1901, Boyton sold Sea Lion Park to Frederic Thompson and Elmer \\"Skip\\" Dundy, who operated \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" in both Buffalo and Steeplechase Park. Thompson and Dundy quickly redesigned Sea Lion Park and redubbed it Luna Park, which quickly added to the legend of Coney Island. White City parks and the amusement park boom alt=Postcard view of Chicago's White City amusement park. The 300-foot-tall Electric Tower was one of the highlights of \\"the city of a million electric lights\\" that could be seen from 15 miles away. In the half decade after the end of the Columbian Exposition, the American concept of the amusement park was starting to take hold, with the increased popularity of shoot-the-chutes rides, roller coasters (with roller coaster designer and entrepreneur Frederick Ingersoll providing many parks - many of long standing - with figure 8 roller coasters and scenic railways long before starting his Luna Park chain in 1905) were being erected in a frenetic pace (over a quarter century period, the Ingersoll Construction Company, erected more than eleven roller coasters per year). Railway companies, noticing the popularity of Midway Plaisance of the Columbian Exposition and the lack of railroad ridership on the weekends, constructed trolley parks as an effort to improve their bottom line. Power companies were starting to partner with railroad companies to create electric trolley companies... and construct Electric Parks. Dale Samuelson, AJP Samuelson, and Wendy Yegoiants, The American Amusement Park (MBI Publishing Company 2001) As the end of the 19th century approached, a few exhibition parks - those inspired by the exhibits and midways of either the Columbian Exposition or the (later) Pan-American Exposition - started to appear. Before the end of the year 1900, White City amusement parks were making their appearance in Philadelphia (1898 - it was also known as Chestnut Hill Park) and Cleveland (1900). Soon, some long-established parks changed their names to White City upon the addition of amusement rides and a midway (Seattle, for example). As the American amusement park was increasing in popularity in the first few years of the 1900s, the success of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition (particularly its \\"Trip to the Moon\\" ride, featuring \\"Luna Park\\") led to the first Luna Park in Coney Island in 1903... and an explosion of nearly identical amusement parks soon followed. There were roughly 250 amusements operating in the United States in 1899; the number almost tripled (700) by 1905; and more than doubled again (to 1500) by 1919 - and these latter figures do not include the amusement parks that were opened and permanently closed by then. While the White City in Chicago was not the first one of that name, it was certainly one of the most fondly remembered. Within years of its 1905 founding, dozens of White City parks dotted the United States (with Australia and the United Kingdom having namesakes built by the 1910s). Although most White City parks were out of business by the end of the United States involvement in World War I, a few survived into the middle third of the 20th century. The Chicago White City lasted until 1946; the Worcester park survived until 1960.

Nash Museum at Chucalissa is located on and exhibits excavated materials of the Mississippian culture archaeological site known as Chucalissa (40 SY 1) which means \\"abandoned house\\" in Choctaw. The site is located adjacent to the T. O. Fuller State Park within the city of Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Chucalissa was designated National Historic Landmark in 1994 due to its importance as one of the best-preserved and major prehistoric settlement sites in the region. Description The Walls Phase and some of its associated sites Chucalissa is a Walls Phase mound and plaza complex that was occupied, abandoned and reoccupied several times throughout its history, spanning from 1000 to 1550 CE. It is located on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. Other contemporaneous groups in the area include the Parkin Phase, Menard Phase, and the Nodena Phase. It is known for the well preserved architectural, floral, faunal, and human osteological remains excavated there. During the early 1540s the Hernando de Soto Expedition passed through the area, stopping at many villages along the way. It is thought that the Walls phase may be the Province of Quizquiz encountered by de Soto on the banks of the Mississippi River. There is no evidence that Chucalissa itself was visited by the expedition, as it is thought to have been abandoned at the time. C. H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa Civilian Conservation Corps workers discovered Native American artifacts on the site in 1938 and archaeological excavations of this Mississippian mound complex were initiated. The C. H. Nash Museum at Chucalissa and the rest of the village grounds have been operated by the University of Memphis since 1962.C. H.
