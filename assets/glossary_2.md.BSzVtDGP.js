Biography  Antonio Lauro was born in Ciudad Bol√≠var, Venezuela. His father Antonio Lauro Ventura, an Italian immigrant, was a barber who could sing and play the guitar so he taught his son what he could, but died when Antonio was still a child. After the family moved to Caracas, Lauro pursued formal musical study (piano, composition) at the Academia de M√∫sica y Declamaci√≥n, where the composer Vicente Emilio Sojo (1887‚Äì1974) was one of his teachers. A 1932 concert performed in Caracas by Agust√≠n Barrios, the Paraguayan guitarist and composer, so much impressed the young Lauro (already an accomplished folk guitarist) that he was persuaded to abandon piano and violin in favor of the guitar. From 1933, Lauro studied with Ra√∫l Borges (1888‚Äì1967), and was introduced to the classical guitar repertoire. In the next decade, Borges' pupils would also include Rodrigo Riera, Jos√© Rafael Cisneros, and Alirio D√≠az. These colleagues, especially D√≠az, were later responsible for unveiling Lauro's works to an international audience, introducing these unheard works to, among others, Andr√©s Segovia, Leo Brouwer and John Williams. Like many South Americans of his generation, Lauro was a fervent cultural nationalist, determined to rescue and celebrate his nation's musical heritage. As a member of the Trio Cantores del Tr√≥pico in 1935‚Äì1943 (Lauro sang bass and played both guitar and cuatro), he toured nearby countries to introduce them to Venezuelan music. Lauro was particularly attracted to the myriad colonial parlour valses venezolanos (Venezuelan waltzes) created in the previous century by accomplished national composers such as Ram√≥n Delgado Palacios (1867‚Äì1902). Unfailingly melodic and characterized by a distinctive syncopation (created by a hemiola in which two measures of 3/4 become a single measure of 3/2), such music was precisely the sort of folkloric raw material which Smetana, Bart√≥k or Granados had elevated to the category of national art in Europe. A concert whose programme consisted entirely of such valses venezolanos (Venezuelan waltzes) by the distinguished Venezuelan pianist Evencio Castellanos (1914‚Äì1984) convinced Lauro that the guitar, too, should have comparable pieces in its repertory. Among his first efforts in this genre were the pieces later known as Tatiana, Andre√≠na, and Natalia, composed sometime between 1938 and 1940; their instant popularity inspired still others. In addition to his guitar pieces, Lauro composed dozens of works for orchestra, choir, piano and voice; many of which remain unpublished. He occasionally experimented with modern compositional techniques, but most of his guitar music remains essentially on the Calle Real or \\"main street,\\" an expression used by musicians of Lauro's generation to refer to a straight and direct route, without distracting harmonic detours. In 1948, the military junta of General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez imprisoned Lauro for his principled belief in democracy. Lauro later shrugged off the experience, telling his friends that prison was a normal part of life for the Venezuelan man of his generation. He had continued composing even in prison, and after his release immediately returned to performing with a pioneering professional classical guitar trio, the freshly formed Trio Ra√∫l Borges. In the following decades Lauro's compositions were published, recorded and performed throughout the world, and his contributions to his nation's musical life were recognized and acknowledged. Lauro was appointed professor of guitar at several distinguished schools including the Juan Jos√© Landaeta Conservatory, and was named president of the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra where he played the horn. In spite of his modest insistence that he was a composer rather than a performer, he was persuaded by his friends to embark upon a solo concert tour, which began in Venezuela and culminated in a triumphant 1980 performance at London's Wigmore Hall. Shortly before his death at Caracas in 1986, he was presented with the Premio Nacional de M√∫sica, his country's highest artistic award.  Popular Works  * Seis por derecho: Joropo * Mar√≠a Carolina * El Marabino * Natalia * Suite Venezolana * Angostura * Maria Luisa * Nelly * 4 Valses venezolanos * El Negrito * Triptico  Legacy  The works of Antonio Lauro have long been very popular with guitarists worldwide, yet there have been few recordings devoted exclusively to him. However, several recordings by Adam Holzman, John Williams (guitarist) and David Russell have been issued. John Williams is quoted as having referred to Antonio Lauro as being the \\"Strauss of the guitar\\". Another recording worth mentioning, \\"A Tribute to Antonio Lauro\\" by Thomas Cronin (guitarist), recorded initially for Irish National Radio on the RTE label, gained great appeal with Venezuelans worldwide. Additionally, Lauro's masterpieces have been the core of studies, workshops and Masters in universities all around the World.

He is most famous for his participation at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. After the death of the Gothic King Vithimiris while fighting against the Huns in 376, Alatheus became, with Saphrax, co-regent and guardian of Vithericus, infant son of Vithimiris. He helped in the leadership of the great Gothic migration before the Hun onslaught, he crossed the Danube while Rome was busy with Thervingi refugees in that year. He soon allied himself with the Thervingi leaders Fritigern and Alavivus against Rome. Alatheus eluded the Romans and rampaged through Thrace and Moesia in 377‚Äì378. He marched to Fritigern's aid against Emperor Valens at the battle of Adrianople in 378, in which Valens was killed when Alatheus' forces were victorious. He continued to raid Thrace and northern Greece, but was defeated by Theodosius the Great's general Promotus, and he settled on the north side of the Danube. He appeared on its banks again in 386, with the intention of invading the Roman provinces again. His forces were, however, repulsed, and Alatheus was slain.Ammianus Marcellinus, Rerum Gestarum xxxi. 3, &c.;Jordanes, Getica 26, 27Claudian, de IV Cons.

After the death of the King Vithimiris while fighting against the Huns in 376, Alatheus and Saphrax became regents and guardians of Vithericus, infant son of Vithimiris. He and Alatheus commanded the Greuthungi, while Fritigern commanded the Thervingi, numbering an army of 10,000 (according to contemporary Ammianus Marcellinus) in the Battle of Adrianople in 378 against the Roman Empire. It is theorized that Saphrax led a Hun-Alan contingent. Ending in defeat for Rome, many of their followers rampaged through the Eastern Empire until they were settled years after by Theodosius treaties in Pannonia Prima.

Ian Francis Hancock (Romani: Yanko le Red≈æosko; born 29 August 1942) is a linguist, Romani scholar and political advocate. He was born and raised in England and is one of the main contributors in the field of Romani studies. He is director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at The University of Texas at Austin, where he has been a professor of English, linguistics and Asian studies since 1972. He has represented the Romani people at the United Nations and served as a member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council under President Bill Clinton, who, Hancock claims, has Romani ancestry.Ian Hancock: We Are the Romani People (Ame Sam E Rromane D≈æene), Hertfordshire, Great Britain. University of Hertfordshire Press 2002. Page 130. He also represented the Romani people at the 1997 Rafto Prize award. Early life Hancock was born in London in 1942. His mother, Kitty, is Romanichal; his father, Reginald (Red≈æo), was part Romungro, the descendant of a Hungarian speaker of North Central Romani named Imre Benczi. He acquired the surname Hancock by Imre's daughter, Maria, who married a member of an English West Country showman family of that name. In the late 1960s, he became a Romani rights activist after reading reports about anti-Romani discrimination in Britain. In particular, he took up the cause of Romani rights after reading about an incident in which three Romani children were killed in a fire caused by a lamp after police officers, who had arrested their parents, attempted to use a bulldozer to forcibly remove their caravan while they were still inside. In 1971, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of London. Romani studies Hancock has published more than 300 books and articles on the Romani people and language (particularly the Vlax dialect). These works analyse the Romani people through not only Romani linguistics but also history, anthropology, and genetics. He has also appeared in the documentary American Gypsy. He is currently writing a book called On Romani Origins and Identity.Ian Hancock. On Romani Origins and Identity. Hancock supports some of Ralph Lilley Turner's views on Romani history based on the Romani language. In particular, Hancock agrees that the Dom left India much earlier than the Romani people ie before 1000 AD. In fact, he claims that the Indian musicians mentioned in the Shah-Nameh and the atsingani mentioned in The Life of St. George the Anchorite, both of which were previously believed to be ancestors of the Romani people, may have been the ancestors of the Domari people but not of the Romani people. He considers it possible that the Lom split off from the Romani people on reaching Armenia. Contrary to the popular view that the Romani people are descended from low- caste Indians who brought their occupations to Europe, he argues that the Romani people are descended from Indian prisoners of war of Mahmud of Ghazni. As evidence, he points to the presence of Indic words specifically of military origin and to a Banjara oral legend telling of Rajputs who left India through the Himalayas during the Ghaznavid invasions and never returned.Ian Hancock. \\"The Emergence of Romani as a Ko√Øn√© Outside of India.\\" Scholarship and the Gypsy Struggle: Commitment in Romani Studies, Hertfordshire, Great Britain. University of Hertfordshire Press 2000. He also believes that the Romani language originates in a koine language, which he calls \\"Rajputic,\\" between the many Indian languages spoken by the prisoners of war. He finds it thus similar to several other Indian languages, especially Hindustani. As for Romani history, he points out a \\"Pariah syndrome\\" throughout time and space, culminating in the attempted genocide at the hands of Nazi authorities that was simultaneous to that of the Jews and part of the same \\"Final Solution of the Jewish and Gypsy Problem\\" project. Creole language studies Hancock is as well known in the field of linguistics, particularly in the area of pidgin and creole languages, as he is in the world of Romani studies and Romani social activism. In addition to his research on the Krio language of Sierra Leone, he has studied the Gullah language, of coastal South Carolina and Georgia, and the Afro-Seminole Creole language, spoken by a community of Black Seminole descendants in Brackettville, Texas. Hancock was the first scholar to report Afro-Seminole Creole. He later identified another variety of that language spoken among Black Seminole descendants in the village of in the Mexican state of Coahuila, where their ancestors had settled in 1850. He maintains that Afro-Seminole Creole and Gullah are closely related languages, as Black Seminoles were descended primarily from Gullah people of the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia. Hancock is recognised as one of the founders of the field of pidgin and creole linguistics. He has also done extensive research on the English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the West Indies. He is known especially for his views on the historical development of these languages. He maintains that all the English-based pidgins and creoles spoken in the Atlantic basin region, both in West Africa and in the Caribbean, belong to a single language family, which he calls the \\"English-based Atlantic Creoles.\\" He argues that all of them can be traced back to what he calls Guinea Coast Creole English, which arose along the West African Coast in the 17th and 18th centuries, as a language of commerce in the Atlantic slave trade. He says that Guinea Coast Creole English was spoken in coastal slave trading bases such as James Island, Bunce Island, and Elmina Castle, where the offspring of British slave traders and their African wives used it as their native language. Hancock says that Guinea Coast Creole English ultimately gave rise to the pidgin and creole languages spoken in West Africa today, such as the Aku language in the Gambia, Sierra Leone Krio, Nigerian Pidgin English and Cameroonian Pidgin English. He also maintains that some of the Africans taken as slaves to the New World already spoke Guinea Coast Creole English in Africa. Their creole speech influenced the development of creole languages spoken today on the American side of the Atlantic, such as Gullah, Afro-Seminole Creole, Bahamian Dialect, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Kriol, Guyanese Creole, and Sranan Tongo in Suriname. Hancock's views on the connections among the Atlantic creole languages are controversial. The strong similarities among these languages are undeniable, but many linguists prefer to explain the similarities by convergence rather than historical relationships. Other scholars argue that both factors played a role in the formation of the languages. Another group of linguists subscribes to a theory that attributes creole similarities (which extend to Indian Ocean creoles and Hawaiian Creole) to an innate \\"bioprogram\\" for language that emerges under the conditions common to most creole communities.

Early in his career he partnered with Duane Allman, introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint which \\"rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe\\". Following Allman's death in 1971, Betts assumed sole lead guitar duties during the peak of the group's commercial success in the mid-1970s. Betts was the writer and singer on the Allmans' only hit single, \\"Ramblin' Man\\". He also gained renown for composing instrumentals, with one appearing on most of the group's albums, the most notable of these being \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" and \\"Jessica\\" (the latter widely known as the theme to Top Gear). He was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and also won a best rock performance Grammy Award with the band for \\"Jessica\\" in 1996. Betts was ranked No. 58 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list in 2003, and #61 on the list published in 2011. Betts departed the Allman Brothers Band in 2000 under acrimonious circumstances and continued with a solo career that had begun in the 1970s. Biography = Early life = Born in West Palm Beach on December 12, 1943 and raised in Bradenton, Florida, Betts grew up in a musical family listening to traditional bluegrass, country music and Western swing. He started playing ukulele at five and, as his hands got bigger, moved on to mandolin, banjo, and guitar. At sixteen and feeling the need for something \\"a little faster,\\" he played in a series of rock bands on the Florida circuit, up the East Coast and into the Midwest before forming Second Coming with Berry Oakley in 1967. According to Rick Derringer, the \\"group called the Jokers\\" referenced in \\"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\\" was one of Betts' early groups.Scott Freeman, Midnight Riders, pp. 41-42 = Early Allman Brothers Band years = In 1969, Duane Allman had parlayed success as a session player into a contract with Southern soul impresario Phil Walden, who planned to back a power trio featuring Allman. The ensuing Allman Brothers Band eventually grew to six members, including Duane's brother Gregg, Betts, and Oakley. After the death of Duane Allman in late 1971, Betts became the band's sole guitarist and also took on a greater singing and leadership role. Betts, over the course of one night's traveling, practiced slide guitar intensively in order to cover the majority of Duane's parts. He went on to write \\"Jessica\\" and the Allmans' biggest commercial hit, \\"Ramblin' Man\\". \\"Jessica\\" was inspired by his daughter of the same name. = Solo career and later work = Betts's first solo album, Highway Call, was released in 1974, and featured fiddle player Vassar Clements. After the Allman Brothers fell apart in 1976, Betts released more albums, starting with Dickey Betts & Great Southern in 1977, which included the song \\"Bougainvillea\\", co-written with future Hollywood star Don Johnson. In 1978 he released an album, Atlanta's Burning Down. The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979 for the album Enlightened Rogues with two members of Great Southern replacing Allman Brothers members unwilling to participate in the reunion: guitar player Dan Toler (for pianist Chuck Leavell) and bassist David \\"Rook\\" Goldflies (for bassist Lamar Williams). Several albums would follow, with various personnel changes, until steadily declining record and concert ticket sales and tensions around management issues led the group to again disband in 1982. Betts returned to his solo career, performing live at smaller venues and releasing the album Pattern Disruptive in 1989. When a one-off reunion tour was proposed in support of the Allman Brothers' Dreams box set released in 1989 to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary, Betts's solo band again supplied the Allman Brothers' other guitarist, slide guitarist Warren Haynes. The one-off tour's success resulted in a permanent reunion which absorbed Betts's energies for the remainder of the 1990s. This band lineup went on to release three acclaimed studio albums between 1990 and 1994. Betts was replaced on numerous Allman Brothers tour dates throughout the mid-to-late 1990s for what were reported in the media as \\"personal reasons\\". While remaining active as a touring band, they failed to release an album of new studio material after 1994's Where It All Begins until 2003's Hittin' the Note. Haynes and Allman Brothers bassist Allen Woody formed Gov't Mule with former Dickey Betts Band drummer Matt Abts as a side project in 1994 and left the Allman Brothers for Gov't Mule full-time in 1997. Betts' last show with the Allman Brothers was at the Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta, Georgia on May 7, 2000. Things reached a breaking point when the remaining original Allman Brothers members ‚Äì Gregg Allman, Butch Trucks and Jaimoe ‚Äì suspended Betts (reportedly via fax) before the launch of the band's Summer Campaign Tour 2000. According to Betts, the band told him in the fax to get clean (presumably from alcohol and/or drugs). Betts was subsequently ordered out of the band after the dispute went to arbitration.Allman, Gregg. My Cross To Bear, HarperCollins, (2012). Betts was temporarily replaced for the 2000 tour by Jimmy Herring, formerly of the Aquarium Rescue Unit. When Betts filed suit against the other three original Allmans, the separation turned into a permanent divorce. Although separated personally and as musical bandmates for over 15 years, Betts and Gregg Allman did reconcile before Allman's death in 2017. Betts re-formed the Dickey Betts Band in 2000 and toured that summer. The band reassumed the name Dickey Betts & Great Southern and added Betts' son Duane (named after Duane Allman) on lead guitar. In 2005 Betts released the DVD Live from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. = Personal life = Betts married his fifth wife, Donna, in 1989. He has four children: Kimberly, Christy, Jessica, and Duane. Christy is married to Frank Hannon of the band Tesla. Duane, named for Betts' former bandmate Duane Allman, is also a musician, and has performed and recorded with his father. In August 2018, Betts suffered a mild stroke and had to cancel upcoming tour dates with his Dickey Betts Band. He was in critical yet stable condition at a Florida hospital following an accident at his home in Osprey, Florida. Surgery was planned for September 20, 2018. He successfully underwent surgery to relieve swelling on his brain. A statement posted on his website says Betts and his family said the \\"outpouring of support from all over the world has been overwhelming and amazing. We are so appreciative.\\" Although he briefly resided in Georgia during the formative years of the Allman Brothers Band, he has lived in the Sarasota metropolitan area for most of his life.

Piping dacquoise meringue disks onto a baking sheet. A pastry bag (or piping bag in the Commonwealth) is an often cone- or triangular-shaped bag made from cloth, paper, plastic, or the intestinal lining of a lamb, that is squeezed by hand to pipe semi-solid foods by pressing them through a narrow opening at one end often fitted with a shaped nozzle, for many purposes including in particular cake decoration and icing. It is filled through a wider opening at the opposite end, rolled or twisted closed, and then squeezed to extrude its contents. Many differently shaped nozzles are used to produce cross-sections such as star, leaf, and flower- petal shapes; a simple circular nozzle makes round shapes and is also used for filling pastries such as profiteroles. In addition to icing, pastry bags are commonly used to shape meringue and whipped cream, and to fill doughnuts with jelly or custard. They are used to form cream puffs, √©clairs, and ladyfingers. Bags can also be used to shape savory foods such as filling for deviled eggs, whipped butter, and mashed potatoes (especially for Pommes duchesse). Reusable bags are usually made from tightly woven nylon, polyester, rubber or waterproofed (plastic-coated) cotton. After use they are washed and hung to dry. A high-quality bag may last for many years. Disposable bags do not, of course, require washing; they are typically made of inexpensive plastic. A plastic food storage bag may be used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged. Interchangeable tips usually come in sets; particular tips can often be purchased individually. They may be chrome-plated or stainless steel, or plastic. Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; in some cases they are inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in. If tips need to be interchanged without emptying the bag, they can be used with pairs of adapter rings: an inner ring is dropped inside the bag and pushed part way out the hole, a tip is slipped over the ring, then an outer ring is slipped over the tip and screwed onto the inner ring. Some inexpensive sets are of disposable plastic film with a drop- in ring and screw-on plastic tips (see image above). Many foods (including frosting and pressurized \\"spray can\\" whipped cream) can be purchased in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a pastry bag.

The strike began on August 12, 1994, and resulted in the remainder of that season being cancelled, including the postseason and, for the first time since 1904, the World Series. The strike was suspended on April 2, 1995, after 232 days, making it the longest such stoppage in MLB history and the longest work stoppage in major league professional sports at the time (breaking the record set by the 1981 strike); its length would be surpassed by the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, which ran for 310 days and caused the cancellation of that league's entire 2004‚Äì05 season. 948 games were cancelled in all, and MLB became the first major professional sports league to lose an entire postseason due to labor struggles. Due to the strike, both the 1994 and 1995 seasons were not played to a complete 162 games; the strike was called after most teams had played at least 113 games in 1994. Each team played 144 games in 1995. Background In response to a worsening financial situation in baseball, the owners of Major League Baseball teams collectively proposed a salary cap to their players. Ownership claimed that small-market clubs would fall by the wayside unless teams agreed to share local broadcasting revenues (to increase equity among the teams) and enact a salary cap, a proposal that the players adamantly opposed. On January 18, 1994, the owners approved a new revenue- sharing plan keyed to a salary cap, which required the players' approval. The following day, the owners amended the Major League agreement by giving complete power to the commissioner on labor negotiations. The dispute was played out with a backdrop of years of hostility and mistrust between the two sides. What arguably stood in the way of a compromise settlement was the absence of an official commissioner ever since the owners forced Fay Vincent to resign in September 1992. Vincent said the owners had colluded in the signing of free agents, which led to \\"a $280 million theft\\" by Bud Selig and Jerry Reinsdorf, which \\"polluted labor relations in baseball\\" and left Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, with \\"no trust in Selig.\\" On February 11, 1994, the owners greatly reduced the commissioner's power to act in \\"the best interests of baseball.\\" Owner representative Richard Ravitch officially unveiled the ownership proposal on June 14, 1994. The proposal would guarantee a record $1 billion in salary and benefits. But the ownership proposal also would have forced clubs to fit their payrolls into a more evenly based structure. Salary arbitration would have been eliminated, free agency would begin after four years rather than six, and owners would have retained the right to keep a four- or five-year player by matching his best offer. Owners claimed that their proposal would raise average salaries from $1.2 million in 1994 to $2.6 million by 2001. Fehr rejected the offer from the owners on July 18. He believed a salary cap was simply a way for owners to clean up their own disparity problems with no benefit to the players. On July 13, 1994, Fehr said if serious negotiations between the players and the owners did not begin soon, the players could go out on strike in September of that year, threatening the postseason. On December 31, 1993, Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement ran out with no new agreement yet signed. Strike =June= As negotiations continued to heat up, the owners decided to withhold $7.8 million that they were required to pay per previous agreement into the players' pension and benefit plans. The final straw came on June 23 when the Senate Judiciary Committee failed to approve an antitrust legislation by a vote of 10‚Äì7. According to Fehr, the action left the players with little choice but to strike. \\"We felt in '94 we were pushed into it,\\" he said. \\"I still think that's a justified conclusion.\\" =July‚ÄìAugust= On July 28, the Players Association executive board set August 12, 1994, as a strike date. When that day came, the players went ahead with their threat to walk off the job. The last games of that baseball season were played on August 11, 1994. On August 31, three-and-a-half hours of negotiations with federal mediators produced no progress in the strike, and no further talks were scheduled as the strike went into its 4th week. According to then-acting commissioner Bud Selig, September 9 was the tentative deadline for canceling the rest of the season if no agreement was reached between the owners and players. The MLBPA offered a counterproposal to ownership on September 8 calling for a two-percent tax on the 16 franchises with the highest payrolls to be divided among the other 12 clubs. Teams in both leagues would share 25% of all gate receipts under the MLBPA's plan. The owners responded by claiming that the measures wouldn't meet the cost. The rest of the season, including the World Series, was called off by Bud Selig on September 14. Selig acknowledged that the strike had torn an irreparable hole in the game's fabric. The move to cancel the rest of the season meant the loss of $580 million in ownership revenue and $230 million in player salaries. In 1994, the average MLB salary was an estimated $1.2 million. =Reaction= The Montreal Expos' best season in their history was stopped by the strike. They had the best record in baseball, 74‚Äì40, and were six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East despite having the second-lowest payroll in MLB. Most baseball writers considered the Expos to be World Series contenders. Coincidentally, the only time that the Expos actually made it to the postseason was in 1981, the last time that there was a significant players' strike in Major League Baseball. That season, Montreal qualified by winning the 2nd half of the 1981 season. Chicago White Sox star Frank Thomas, who wound up winning the American League's Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for the second year in a row in 1994, said \\"I've had a career year, but I'm not going to finish it.\\" Tony Gwynn had a chance to be the first to finish a season over .400 since Ted Williams, as he was batting .394 at the time of the strike. The strike also cost Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants a chance to beat Roger Maris' single season home run record. When the strike forced the cancellation of the remaining 47 games of the season, Williams had already hit 43 home runs, on pace to match Maris' single season record of 61 home runs. Cleveland Indians second baseman Carlos Baerga was unable to extend his record two-year streak of 20 home runs, 200 hits, and 100 RBI by a second baseman because of the strike. Seattle Mariners star Ken Griffey, Jr., who led the American League with 40 home runs at the time of the strike, summed it up by saying, \\"We picked a bad season to have a good year.\\" Kevin Mitchell of the Cincinnati Reds, Julio Franco of the Chicago White Sox, and Shane Mack of the Minnesota Twins, all .325 hitters in 1994, opted during the strike to play in Japan in 1995. By the third day of the strike, Cleveland Indians owner Richard Jacobs directed that all souvenirs being sold at the Indians' gift shop carrying the words \\"inaugural season at Jacobs Field\\" be sold at half price. The Colorado Rockies were completing their last season at Mile High Stadium with an attendance of 3,281,511 through 57 home games for an average of 57,570 per game. At that pace, the team would have had a good chance of drawing over 4.6 million fans in their 81 home games if the season had continued. This would have eclipsed the major league season attendance record of 4,483,350 fans set by the Rockies only the season before. One of the few positive notes was that fans were spared from witnessing one of the worst division races in history. The Texas Rangers were leading the newly reformed AL West despite being 10 games under .500. The last-place California Angels were only games out despite having the second-worst record in the majors at 21 games under .500‚Äîon pace for 96 losses. In fact, the two last place teams in the other American League divisions (namely, the Detroit Tigers of the AL East and Milwaukee Brewers of the AL Central) had better records than the Rangers. The National League's MVP award was given to Jeff Bagwell. His hand was broken by a pitch on August 10, just before the players' strike began; had the season continued, he would likely have missed the remainder of the year and might not have won the MVP. But because of the timing of his \\"lucky break\\", Bagwell became just the fourth player in National League history to win the award unanimously. The strike also led to an absurdity. The Minnesota Twins traded Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later. Since the strike led to the season being cancelled, no further transactions could be made until it was settled. The Twins would officially be listed as having sold Winfield to the Indians, but the actual transaction was conducted much differently. Instead of the Indians buying the contract outright, team management went out for a meal with Twins management and the Indians paid the tab; this essentially meant that Winfield had been traded for dinner. Arguably, the biggest storyline of the strike was the New York Yankees. In having the best record in the American League, which was also the second-best record in baseball, 70-43, and a game lead over the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East, the largest division lead of any division leader, the strike cost their captain, Don Mattingly, his best chance at his postseason debut in his 13-year career. The Yankees had not been in the postseason since 1981. Because the Yankees' prior postseason chances had also been cut short by a strike, news media reported on the parallels between the two Yankee teams (1981 and 1994), both of which had division leads taken away by strike actions. Mattingly would reach the playoffs for the first and only time in his playing career the following year, being defeated at the hands of the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS in five games. =December= On December 5, it was announced Richard Ravitch would step down as negotiator for the owners on December 31, 1994. Ravitch instead resigned on December 6, 1994. On December 14, labor talks headed by federal mediator William Usery broke down. The next day, the owners approved a salary cap plan by a vote of 25‚Äì3, but agreed to delay implementing it so that another round of talks with the players could be held. On December 23, with negotiations at a standstill, the owners unilaterally implemented a salary cap. =January 1995= On January 4, 1995, five bills aimed at ending the baseball strike were introduced into Congress. The next day, Fehr declared all 895 unsigned Major League players to be free agents in response to unilateral contract changes made by the owners. On January 10, arbitrator Thomas Roberts awarded 11 players a total of almost $10 million as a result of collusion charges brought against the owners. On January 26, both players and owners were ordered by President Bill Clinton to resume bargaining and reach an agreement by February 6. Unfortunately, President Clinton's deadline came and went with no resolution of the strike. Just five days earlier, the owners agreed to revoke the salary cap and return to the old agreement. =Replacement players= After the deadline passed with no compromises, the use of replacement players for spring training and regular season games was approved by baseball's executive council on January 13. Replacement players were reportedly guaranteed US$5,000 for reporting to spring training and another $5,000 if they made the Opening Day roster. Selig declared that, \\"We are committed to playing the 1995 season and will do so with the best players willing to play.\\" On March 14, the players' union announced that it would not settle the strike if replacement players were used in regular season games, and if results were not voided. Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson was put on an involuntary leave of absence as he refused to manage replacement players. Replacement players created major issues for two American League teams. The Toronto Blue Jays would be unable to play games with replacement players or umpires in Ontario, due to labour code amendments passed by the Ontario NDP that prohibited replacement workers. This would be confirmed in a March 28, 1994 Ontario Labour Board hearing. Manager Cito Gaston and his coaching staff were sent to work with minor league players, and the team would announce that games featuring replacement workers would be played at their Spring training facility in Dunedin, Florida. The Baltimore Orioles, owned by prominent union lawyer Peter Angelos, announced they would also not be using replacement players. On March 20, Angelos's Orioles canceled the remainder of their spring training games. The next day, the Maryland House of Delegates approved legislation to bar teams playing at Camden Yards from using replacement players. On March 26, the MLB announced that the 1995 season would be reduced from 162 games per team to 144 games per team as a result of the use of replacement players. =Television deal collapses= Following the end of the 1993 season, CBS Sports lost the rights to broadcast baseball games on television. Production of nationally televised games was taken over by MLB itself, which sold the games as brokered programming to ABC and NBC as part of a joint venture that was referred to as The Baseball Network. Originally, the idea was for ABC and NBC to share a slate of games aired in prime time during the week, with the two networks alternating coverage of the All-Star Game and World Series and splitting the Division and League Championship Series between them. The agreement was to run for six seasons and end in 1999, with ABC and NBC airing the World Series and All-Star Game three times each. The strike, however, resulted in ABC losing out on two weeks of coverage and the World Series and NBC losing out on all of its allotted regular season games. MLB and the local NBC and ABC stations lost a combined $595 million in advertising revenue, and both networks announced that they would be opting out of the deal after the shortened 1995 season; the Fox network became the new broadcast partner for MLB in 1996, and has remained as such since, although NBC stayed on and broadcast only the postseason until the 2000 season. Strike ends On March 28, 1995, the players voted to return to work if a U.S. District Court judge supported the National Labor Relations Board's unfair labor practices complaint against the owners (which was filed on March 27). By a vote of 27‚Äì3, owners supported the use of replacement players. The strike ended when Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a preliminary injunction against the owners on March 31. On April 2, 1995, the day before the season was scheduled to start with the replacement players, the strike came to an official end at 232 days. Judge Sotomayor's decision received support from a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. As part of the terms of the injunction, the players and owners were to be bound to the terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement until a new one could be reached and the start of the season would be postponed three weeks, with teams playing an abbreviated 144-game season instead of a 162-game season. Post-strike =1995 season= During the first days of the 1995 season, some fans remained irate at both players and owners. Attendance at the games plummeted, as did television ratings, to a greater extent than during the last significant players strike in 1981. While a total of 50,010,016 fans had attended the 1,600 MLB regular season games played in 1994, averaging 31,256 per game, a total of 50,416,880 fans attended the 2,016 games of the 1995 MLB regular season, for an average attendance of just 25,008 per game. This represented a decline in average attendance of 20% from 1994 to 1995. A few of the fans who showed up demonstrated their frustration, and booed the players; the strike was seen as the worst work stoppage in sports history, leaving the game in crisis and some fans shaken and angry. Among the major examples of fan protests: *Three men wearing T-shirts emblazoned with \\"Greed\\" leaped onto the field at Shea Stadium to a standing ovation, and tossed $160 in $1 bills at the players' feet before being restrained by security, who were loudly booed as the men were escorted from the field. *In Cincinnati, one fan paid for a plane to fly over Riverfront Stadium that carried a banner reading \\"Owners & Players: To hell with all of you!\\" *Fans in Pittsburgh disrupted the Opening Day game between the Montreal Expos and the Pittsburgh Pirates by throwing various objects on the field, causing a 17-minute delay before being warned that the game would be declared a forfeit to the Expos; however, they continued to boo afterwards. *In Detroit, fans booed and hurled beer bottles, cans, baseballs, cigarette lighters, and a hubcap onto the field, causing a 12-minute delay, while holding up signs saying \\"Field of ~~Dreams~~ Greed\\" and \\"Strike, Owner$ Win, Player$ Win, Fans Lose\\".Baseball's Darkest Days *While 50,425 fans showed up for the New York Yankees' home opener against the Texas Rangers, it was the smallest opening day crowd at Yankee Stadium since 1990. MLBPA President Donald Fehr attended the game, angering many fans who blamed him for ruining their team's postseason chances, and also what would have been Don Mattingly's postseason debut. Fans booed Fehr and yelled \\"You ruined the game!\\" in response to him having attended the last game played at Yankee Stadium before the strike, and also booed him as he left the stadium. During the game, one fan held up a sign saying \\"$HAME ON YOU!\\", to which Fehr responded by flipping off the fan. The opening games were played with replacement umpires, the first time since Opening Day 1991 that replacement umpires were used. On August 3, 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a bill calling for the partial repeal of baseball's antitrust exemption to the full Senate. The vote was just 9‚Äì8. On August 9, George Nicolau, baseball's impartial arbitrator since 1986, was fired by Major League owners. On September 29, 1995, a three-judge panel in New York voted unanimously to uphold the injunction that brought the end to the strike in April 1995. The owners had appealed the injunction issued on March 31, but the panel said the Players Relations Committee had illegally attempted to eliminate free agency and salary arbitration. =Replacement players on postseason teams= While replacement players from the 1995 spring training were allowed to play on postseason teams, these players were not allowed to have their names or likenesses on any commemorative merchandise; furthermore, they could not be featured in video games or tabletop games, and were instead replaced by placeholder players. The affected players include Shane Spencer of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 New York Yankees, Damian Miller of the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks, Brendan Donnelly of the 2002 Anaheim Angels, Kevin Millar of the 2004 Boston Red Sox, and Jamie Walker of the 2006 Detroit Tigers. =Long-term impact= Arguably the largest impact was to the Montreal Expos. The strike was considered to be start of the franchise's downfall in Montreal, eventually leading to their becoming the Washington Nationals. Not only did their dream season (first in MLB, six games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the NL East) end abruptly, they were forced to lower payroll and sell off their four highest paid stars (Marquis Grissom, Ken Hill, Larry Walker, and John Wetteland) in the span of less than a week in spring training. With the strike negatively affecting its fan base, the Expos would never recover from the incident. Despite respectable performances in 1996, 2002 and 2003, the team never came close to contending again; the team was purchased by Major League Baseball after the 2001 season, and would become the focus of contraction rumors until the team was moved to Washington, D.C., to become the Washington Nationals after the 2004 season. The franchise won its first World Series in 2019, as the Nationals.

It is on the BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain, approximately 30 km east of the capital Bucharest, in the historical region of Wallachia. It has a population of 6,217. The A2 freeway and Mosti»ôtea River pass through its vicinity. Two villages are administered by the town: Alexandru Ioan Cuza and Gostilele. Historically, Fundulea's outskirts housed a military base maintained by the Romanian Army. The town is home to an agricultural institute, the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute (, INCDA). A reservoir known as Lake Fundulea, fed by water from the Mosti»ôtea, is a popular spot for sport fishing. History During the 19th century, the village of Fundulea housed the Sionu estate of writer Gheorghe Sion, which, through the 1923 marriage of his daughter Marica, became the property of eccentric novelist, poet, and heraldist Mateiu Caragiale.Perpessicius, \\"Tabel cronologic\\", in Mateiu Caragiale, Craii de Curtea-Veche, Editura pentru LiteraturƒÉ, Bucharest, 1965, p.XIX, XXI. Caragiale intended to turn it into a private domain, and reportedly flew an ensign he had created for himself. The INCDA was created in 1962, during the Communist period, through the merger between the Research Institute for Maize Cultivation (Institutul de CercetƒÉri pentru Cultura Porumbului) and the Field Cultivation Department (Departamentul Culturilor de C√¢mp) of the Romanian Agronomic Institute.Official site of INCDA Fundulea; retrieved July 10, 2007 Fundulea is also the birthplace of novelist Mircea Nedelciu (1950-1999), in whose honor a local primary school was named in 2002.

Their first school was opened in Waterford, Ireland, in 1802. At the time of its foundation, though much relieved from the harshest of the Penal Laws by the Irish Parliament's Relief Acts, much discrimination against Catholics remained throughout the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland pending full Catholic Emancipation in 1829. This congregation is sometimes referred to as simply \\"the Christian Brothers\\", leading to confusion with the De La Salle Brothers ‚Äì also known as the Christian Brothers (sometimes by Lasallian organisations themselves), Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools and Lasallians ‚Äì founded in France by Jean-Baptiste de la Salle (later canonised). Rice's congregation is sometimes called the Irish Christian Brothers or the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers to differentiate the two teaching orders. Since the Second Vatican Council, the reputation of the congregation has been marred by widespread sexual abuse cases. History =Formation of the Christian brothers= Edmund Rice At the turn of the nineteenth century, Waterford merchant Edmund Rice considered travelling to Rome to join a religious institute, possibly the Augustinians. Instead, with the support of The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Hussey, Lord Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, he decided to found a religious community dedicated to teaching disadvantaged youth. The first school, on Waterford's New Street, was a converted stable and opened in 1802, with a second school opening in Stephen Street soon after to cater for increasing enrollment. Two men from his hometown of Callan, Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, soon arrived to aid Rice in his makeshift schools, with the intention of living the life of lay brothers. In the same year, Rice used proceeds from the sale of his victualling business to begin building a community house and school on land provided by the diocese. Bishop Hussey opened the new complex, christened ‚ÄúMount Sion‚Äù on June 7, 1803, and pupils were transferred to the new school building the following year. The reputation of the school spread and across the next few years several men sought to become ‚ÄúMichaels‚Äù. On 15 August 1808 seven men, including Edmund Rice, took religious promises under Bishop John Power of Waterford. Following the example of Nano Nagle's Presentation Sisters, they were called \\"Presentation Brothers\\". This was one of the first congregations of men to be founded in Ireland and one of the few founded in the Church by a layman. Houses were soon opened in Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan, and in 1811, in Cork. In 1812 the Archbishop of Dublin established a community in the nation's capital and by 1907 there were ten communities in Dublin, with pupils in excess of 6,000. The schools included primary, secondary and technical schools, along with orphanages and a school for the deaf. A community was founded in Limerick in 1816, followed by establishments in several of Ireland's principal towns. The Holy See formally established the congregation in 1820. This, too, was an unusual event, since the Christian Brothers were the first Irish congregation of men approved by a charter from Rome. Some brothers in Cork chose to remain under the original Presentation rule and continued to be known as Presentation Brothers, a separate congregation but also recognising Edmund Rice as its Founder. =Expansion= The congregation of Irish Christian Brothers spread to Liverpool and other parts of England. These new ventures were not always immediately successful. Two brothers had been sent to Gibraltar to establish an institute in 1835. However, despite initial successes they left in August 1837 on account of disagreements with the local priests. In 1878 the Brothers returned to the then Crown colony of Gibraltar. The school eventually flourished supplying education to the twentieth century. The \\"Line Wall College\\" was noted in 1930 for the education that it supplied to \\"well to do\\" children.Gibraltar Directory for 1930, accessed 8 May 2013 Similarly, a mission to Sydney, Australia, in 1842 failed within a couple of years. Brother Ambrose Treacy established a presence in Melbourne, Australia, in 1868, in 1875 in Brisbane, Australia, and in 1876 a school was commenced in Dunedin, New Zealand. In 1875 a school was opened in St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland. In 1886 the Pope requested that they consider setting up in India, and a province of the congregation was established there. In 1900 came the invitation to establish houses in Rome, and in 1906 schools were established in New York City. In 1940 Iona College was founded in New York, as a Higher Education College,About Iona College Iona College Website. facilitating poorer high school graduates to progress to a College education. St. Joseph's Junior Novitiate Baldoyle was where trainee brothers went to complete their second level studies, normally proceeding to St. Mary's in Marino to train as school teachers. Today there is a nursing home there, and there is over 1000s brothers buried in the cemetery in St. Patrick's Baldoyle. In 1925 the brother's bought St. Helen's, Booterstown which became their administrative headquarters and novitiate. Around 1968 land to the south was used to build two new schools Col√°iste Eoin and Col√°iste √çosag√°in. St. Helen's was sold in 1988. In 1955 Stella Maris College in Uruguay was established. In 1972 the alumnus rugby team was travelling in Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 when it crashed in the Andes, stranding survivors in freezing conditions with little food and no heat for 72 days; 16 of the 45 people on the aircraft survived. In the 1950s due to the number of brothers in Ireland, it was split into two sections divided into North and south by a line from Dublin to Galway.'Secondary School Education in Ireland: History, Memories and Life Stories (1922 - 1967)' By Tom O'Donoghue, Judith Harford. In 1967, the Christian Brothers had a membership of about 5,000, teaching in around 600 schools. The Christian Brothers teacher training centre St. Mary's/Colaiste Mhuire has become the Marino Institute for Education which has trained lay teachers since 1972 and has offered degrees validated by the University of Dublin since 1974. In 2012 Trinity College Dublin became a co- trustee with the Brothers of the Institute.Trinity College Dublin Enters into a Co-Trusteeship of the Marino Institute of Education Communications Office TCD, January 30, 2012. The Brothers' schools include primary, secondary and technical schools, orphanages and schools for the deaf. A number of these technical schools originally taught poor children trades such as carpentry and building skills for which they could progress to gain apprenticeships and employment. As the National School system and vocational schools developed in the Irish Republic, the Irish Christian Brothers became more concentrated on secondary education. =Contraction= As of 2013, the Christian Brothers were living in 280 houses. In 2008 it was reported that not more than ten Christian Brothers were teaching in Irish schools, with the expectation that there would soon be none. This was contrasted with the mid-1960s, when over 1,000 Brothers worked in schools, with no shortage of new recruits. Organizational structure of the Christian Brothers Traditional crest of the Christian Brothers, incorporating the Latin motto Facere et docere (\\"To Do and To Teach\\"). Many schools run by the Brothers feature the cross in their school logo. Geographically, the Christian Brothers are divided into several provinces that encompass every inhabited continent. The brothers within each province work under the direction of a Province Leadership Team. In turn, the entire Congregation operates under the leadership of a Congregation Leadership Team that is based in Rome (and led by the Congregation Leader). These provincial and congregational teams are elected on a six-year basis at Congregation chapters. Restructuring has taken place in the congregation to account for the changing needs, in particular the declining number of brothers in the developed world. The three provinces of North America (Canada, Eastern American, and Western American Province) restructured into the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North America on 1 July 2005.Embracing a Common Future The provinces that cover Ireland, England and the Congregational Leadership Team in Rome combined into a single European province on May 5, 2007,edmundrice.org.au - New European Province while the five provinces covering Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea combined into one Oceania province on October 1, 2007,Shaping Our Future The English Province is a registered charity. The Dublin Headquarters are in the grounds of Marino Institute of Education, Claremont, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, Ireland. A special community within this new European province will be based in Geneva, Switzerland, working to establish an NGO known as Edmund Rice International. The purpose of such an organisation is to gain what is known as a \\"general consultative status\\" with the United Nations. \\"This position allows groups the opportunity to challenge systemic injustice and to engage in advocacy work with policy makers on behalf of people who are made poor.\\" As well as including Christian Brothers from provinces all over the world, members of the Presentation Brothers will also have a presence within this community. Edmund Rice Development is a faith-based non-governmental organisation with charity status in Ireland. Based in Dublin, Edmund Rice Development was established in 2009, to formalise the fundraising efforts of the developing world projects for the Christian Brothers globally and received its charitable status in 2009. Funding raised by the charity is directed mainly to nine countries in Africa, where The Christian Brothers work on mission in development: Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Additional funds are also raised for similar work in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay) and India. = List of Superiors General = The following is a list of the Superiors General of the Congregation of Christian Brothers.

In most of their schools in Ireland Gaelic football and hurling (and Handball) were encouraged as opposed to foreign sports and there were even examples of boys being punished for playing soccer. The also runs and sponsor The Rice Cup set up in 1944, is named after the order's founder, for post-primary hurling, also the Westcourt Cup and Rice Shield. Many of the first Irish language textbooks were produced by the Christian brothers for their schools.

Sexual abuse of children In the late 20th and early 21st century many cases were exposed of emotional, physical and sexual abuse of children in the Christian Brothers' care over a number of decades. Cases emerged in Ireland, Canada, the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom. =Australia= The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse documented Christian Brothers activities in Australia and in particular in Ballarat. 22% of Christian Brothers across Australia have been alleged sexual predators since 1950, according to the royal commission. The commissioners concluded that the Christian Brothers \\"completely failed... to protect the most vulnerable children in their care\\" and that senior brothers‚Äìincluding Brother Paul Nangle, Ballarat's highest Brother in the 1970s‚Äìhad deliberately misled police in more recent statements about their knowledge of abuse. There were allegations that during the 1970s sexual abuses took place at the junior campus of St Patrick's College and St Alipius Primary School in Ballarat, Victoria. After investigation, Brothers Robert Best, Edward Dowlan and Stephen Francis Farrell were all convicted of sex crimes. Dowlan and Best were later transferred to the senior campus, and continued to offend.Ellingsen, Peter. Ballarat's good men of the cloth. The Age Newspaper, June 14, 2002. \\"Four of the school's brothers and their chaplain, Gerald Ridsdale, were accused of sexually assaulting children ‚Äî all but one, who died before charges could be laid, have been convicted.\\" In December 2014, a royal commission found that \\"Christian Brothers leaders knew of allegations of sexual abuse of children at four Western Australian orphanages and failed to manage the homes to prevent the systemic ill- treatment for decades.\\"Banks, Amanda, Legal Affairs Editor. \\"Christian Brothers cop blast\\", The Weekend West, 20‚Äì21 December 2014, p.11 During the 2016 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Ballarat, it was found that 853 children, average age 13, had been sexually abused by one or more Christian Brothers. Child abuse complaints had been made against 281 Christian Brothers, and the Congregation had paid A$37.3 million in compensation. The Royal Commissions final report of Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat was released on 6 December. The report found that 56 Christian Brothers had claims of sexual abuse made against them in Ballarat and that there ‚Äúwas a complete failure by the Christian Brothers to protect the most vulnerable children in their care‚Äù. The response to complaints of sexual abuse was \\"grossly inadequate\\": most often Christian Brothers were moved to a new location after an allegation had been made. The Report found: \\"Often, the Christian Brother in question was allowed to remain in the position he held where the allegations arose, with continuing access to children,\\" and \\"On many occasions, the Brother was moved to a new location after a complaint or allegation was made about his conduct. In some cases, the reason given for the move was to conceal the true reason for it and to protect the reputation of the Christian Brothers and avoid scandal and embarrassment.\\" In February 2020, Rex Francis Elmer pleaded guilty to two charges of indecently assaulting boys at St Vincent‚Äôs Boys‚Äô Orphanage in South Melbourne. He was removed from St Vincent‚Äôs in 1976 after a welfare officer who inspected the orphanage complained that he had ‚Äúinterfered with‚Äù boys who lived at the home. He was appointed headmaster of a Melbourne Catholic boys school a few years after the religious order became aware of his abuse.Known sex abuse priest was appointed headmaster of Catholic junior school =Ireland and the UK= England In December 2012, the Christian Brothers school St Ambrose College, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was implicated in a child sex abuse case. A former lay teacher was convicted of nineteen counts of sexual assault occurring between 1972 and 1991.\\"Deacon Alan Morris jailed for school sex abuse\\", BBC News, 28 August 2014 Ireland The Congregation of the Christian Brothers published full-page advertisements in newspapers in Ireland in March 1998, apologizing to former pupils who had been ill-treated whilst in their care. This advertising campaign expressed \\"deep regret\\" on behalf of the Christian Brothers and listed telephone lines which former pupils could ring if they needed help. In 2003 the Congregation brought a case against the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse seeking to prevent the Commission from naming brothers accused of child abuse. Justice Se√°n Ryan declared that individual alleged perpetrators of abuse would not be named unless they had already been convicted In May 2009 a report was issued by an independent government commission on child abuse committed on thousands of children in residential care institutions run by various religious institutes for the Irish state.Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ireland) , 2009. Chapter 6 of Volume 1 covers the Christian Brothers This report found that sexual abuse of boys in institutions run by the Brothers was common. In response, the Irish ecclesiastical province issued a pledge to pay 161 million euros toward a fund set up to compensate male and female victims of such abuse in both their institutions and those run by other religious institutes. the Christian Brothers in Ireland continued to seek out-of-court settlement for historical claims initiated by survivors of sexual assault by Brothers committed in day schools managed by the order in Ireland. Towards Healing was set up by CORI to offer therapy to survivors of clerical abuse; it is a Catholic organisation about whose independence there has been controversy. The Christian brothers in Ireland used the services of the L&P; groupL&P; (financial and management services) Official website. Accessed 15 October 2015 to set up an education trust. In late November 2009 the organization announced they would supply a ‚Ç¨161 million (¬£145 million sterling) package as part of reparations for child abuse in Ireland.Catholic order pays out for abuse, BBC News, 25 November 2009 This includes a donation of ‚Ç¨30 million to a government trust and ‚Ç¨4 million donated to provide counselling services. Playing fields owned by the organisation and valued at ‚Ç¨127 million would be transferred to joint ownership of the government and the trust that runs former Christian Brothers schools. In 2019 former Brother John Gibson was convicted and sentenced to serve time in prison for his role in abuse in Wexford CBS in the 1980s & 90s. On June 22nd 2020 he received an additional four years after pleading guilty to a number of assault and sexual assault charges. Scotland In 2016 Fr. John Farrell, Retired priest of the Diocese of Motherwell, the last Head teacher at St Ninian's Falkland, Fife, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. His colleague Paul Kelly, a retired teacher from Portsmouth, was given ten years, both were convicted of the physical and sexual abuse of boys between the years 1979 and 1983. More than 100 charges involving 35 boys were made. The school closed in 1983. =Canada= In 1987 men came forward to say that when they were being raised in Mount Cashel Orphanage in St. John's Newfoundland, from the 1950s until the 1970s, they had suffered physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and that when the Archdiocese became aware of the abuse, it removed brothers who were guilty of these acts, but took no other immediate action. Both the St. John's Archdiocese through the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as the Congregation of Christian Brothers have since enacted policies aimed at the prevention of child sexual abuse. =United States = Christian Brother Robert Brouillette, who had taught at St. Laurence High School, was arrested in April 1998 in Joliet, Illinois, for indecent solicitation of a child. He was convicted in March 2000 of 10 charges related to child pornography. In 2002 a civil lawsuit was filed in Cook County, Illinois, against Brouillette for sexual assault against a 21-year-old man. In 2013 the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North American Province, known as Irish Christian Brothers, paid US$16.5 million to 400 victims of child sexual abuse across the US, and agreed to enforce a zero- tolerance policy for brothers accused of abuse. This followed the Brothers filing for bankruptcy in April 2011 following rising legal costs, leading to a reorganization settlement between creditors and the order according to the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy code.

Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead. History Lead white was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described by Pliny the Elder, Vitruvius and the ancient Greek author Theophrastus. The traditional method of making the pigment was called the stack process. Hundreds or thousands of earthenware pots containing vinegar and lead were embedded in a layer of either tan bark or cow dung. The pots were designed so that the vinegar and lead were in separate compartments, but the lead was in contact with the vapor of the vinegar. The lead was usually coiled into a spiral, and placed on a ledge inside the pot. The pot was loosely covered with a grid of lead, which allowed the carbon dioxide formed by the fermentation of the tan bark or the dung to circulate in the pot. Each layer of pots was covered by a new layer of tan, then another layer of pots. The heat created by the fermentation, acetic acid vapor and carbon dioxide within the stack did their work, and within a month the lead coils were covered with a crust of white lead. This crust was separated from the lead, washed and ground for pigment. This was an extremely dangerous process for the workmen. Medieval texts warned of the danger of \\"apoplexy, epilepsy, and paralysis\\" from working with lead white.Daniel V. Thompson, The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting, pp. 90‚Äì91. Despite the risks, the pigment was very popular with artists because of its density and opacity; a small amount could cover a large surface. It was widely used by artists until the 19th century, when it was replaced by zinc white and titanium white.Philip Ball (2000), Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour, pg. 99. The dangers of lead paint were considered well-established by the beginning of the 20th century. In the July 1904 edition of its monthly publication, Sherwin-Williams reported the dangers of paint containing lead, noting that a French expert had deemed lead paint \\"poisonous in a large degree, both for the workmen and for the inhabitants of a house painted with lead colors\\". As early as 1886, German health laws prohibited women and children from working in factories processing lead paint and lead sugar., sections 26 & 121 In 1786, Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter warning a friend about the hazards of lead and lead paint, which he considered well-established. The League of Nations began efforts to ban lead paint in 1921. Toxicity Lead paint can crack and form flakes, which then contaminate the surrounding environment. Lead paint is hazardous. It can cause nervous system damage, stunted growth, kidney damage, and delayed development. It is dangerous to children because it tastes sweet, therefore encouraging children to put lead chips and toys with lead dust in their mouths. Lead paint is dangerous to adults and can cause reproductive problems in men or women. Decreases in sperm production in men have been noted. Lead is considered a possible and likely carcinogen. High levels may result in death. Regulation Lead paint is banned in the European Union by the 2003 Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), which forbids hazardous substances in consumer goods, including paint. This act superseded and harmonized existing laws of the member states, many of which had banned lead paint years before. To protect the painters' health, France had already passed in 1909 a law banning the use of paints containing lead for the painting of the interior and exterior of all buildings. In Canada, regulations were first enacted under the Hazardous Products Act in 1976 that limited lead content of paints and other liquid coatings on furniture, household products, children's products, and exterior and interior surfaces of any building frequented by children to 0.5% by weight. New regulations on surface coating materials, which came into force in 2005, further limit lead to its background level for both interior and exterior paints sold to consumers. Canadian paint manufacturers have been conforming to this background level in their interior and exterior consumer paints since 1991. Nevertheless, a Canadian company, Dominion Colour Corporation, is \\"the largest manufacturer of lead-based paint pigments in the world\\" and has faced public criticism for obtaining permission from the European Chemicals Agency to continue to export lead chromate paints from its Dutch subsidiary to countries where its uses are not tightly regulated.< EPA poster on protecting children from lead poisoning The United States' Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned lead paint in 1977 in residential properties and public buildings (16 CFR 1303), along with toys and furniture containing lead paint. The cited reason was \\"to reduce the risk of lead poisoning in children who may ingest paint chips or peelings\\". For manufacturers, the CPSC instituted the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which changed the cap on lead content in paint from 0.06% to 0.009% starting 14 August 2009. In 2018 the State of Delaware banned the use of lead paint on outdoor structures. Also, the Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act (AKA the \\"Lead Paint Act\\") was created in order to ensure that the disclosure of any lead-based hazards in a building be discussed with potential buyers or renters of units.https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/healthy_homes/enforcement/disclosure In April 2010 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required that all renovators working in homes built before 1978 and disturbing more than six square feet of lead paint inside the home or 20 square feet outside the home be certified. EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule (RRP Rule) lowers the risk of lead contamination from home renovation activities. It requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities and pre-schools (any child occupied facility) built before 1978 be certified by EPA and use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices. As of 2018, there are an estimated 37 million homes and apartments with lead paint in the United States. The Philippines banned lead paint in 2013, but in 2017, 15% of the paint still was not certified. The EcoWaste Coalition and the Philippine Association of Paint Manufacturers declared on 1 January 2020 that the Philippines has phased-out lead paint following the implementation of Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Order 2013‚Äì24, or the Chemical Control Order for Lead and Lead Compounds, which directed manufacturers of lead- containing paints for industrial uses to phase out such paints by 31 December 2019. Lead paint was not prohibited in India until 2016. A 2015 study found that over 31% of household paints in India had lead concentration above 10,000 parts per million (ppm), which far exceeds the BIS standard of 90 ppm for lead in paint. The Regulation on Lead Contents in Household and Decorative Paint Rules came into effect on November 1, 2017, according to which the paints should have lead less than 90 ppm and their label should say so. But two years later, an analysis of 32 locally manufactured paint samples from nine states found lead content ranging from 10 ppm to 1,86,062 ppm, with 90% of samples having lead levels above 90ppm. In South Africa, the Hazardous Substances Act of 2009 classifies lead as a hazardous substance and limits its use in paint to 600 parts per million (ppm). A proposed amendment will modify this to 90 ppm, thereby almost completely eradicating lead from paint. The amendment would also include all industrial paints, which were previously excluded. Lead paint in art =Oil paints= In art, white lead paint is known as \\"flake white\\" or \\"Cremnitz white\\". It is valued for the ease of handling and resilience the lead confers to oil paints. Lead white paint dries relatively quickly to form a strong, flexible paint film. Lead-based white is one of the oldest manufactured pigments. It was the only white pigment available to artists in appreciable quantities until the twentieth century, when zinc white and titanium white became available. Industrially produced lead white, the typical pigment from the 19th century until its ban, was thought to be inferior to traditionally fabricated forms, which had larger \\"flake\\" particles that conferred ease of handling. Titanium and zinc whites are far less toxic than lead white and have largely supplanted it in most fine arts applications. Safety regulations have also made lead white more expensive and difficult to obtain in some regions, such as the EU. Lead white oil paints are still produced and in use by artists who prefer their unique handling, mixing, and structural qualities. Flake white has various drawbacks, including a tendency to become transparent over time. It also blackens in the presence of certain atmospheric pollutants, although this can be reversed. =Water-based paints= Lead is not a traditional pigment in water media, as zinc is superior for works on paper, as is calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) for frescos. Lead-based paints, when used on paper, often cause the work to become discolored after long periods; the paint's lead carbonate reacts with hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, which often come from fingerprints. Substitutes =Titanium= Paint manufacturers have replaced white lead with a less toxic substitute, titanium white (based on the pigment titanium dioxide), which was first used in paints in the 19th century. Titanium dioxide is considered safe enough to use as a food coloring and in toothpaste. It is also a common ingredient in sunscreen. When used in paints today, it is often coated with silicon or aluminium oxides for durability. Titanium white has far greater opacity and tinting strength than lead white, and it can easily overpower most other pigments if not mixed carefully. Titanium white has been criticized for leading to \\"chalkiness\\" in mixtures, and for allegedly decreasing the permanence of organic pigments mixed with it due to its high refractive index. =Zinc= Zinc white is less opaque and weaker in tinting strength than either titanium white or lead white. It is commonly used to lighten mixtures subtly while maintaining transparency. Although zinc white is the standard white in watercolors, its structural soundness in oils has been debated. Zinc white dries slowly and creates a relatively inflexible paint film. Critics of the pigment argue that its use leads to excessive cracking and delamination, even when used sparingly.

It is one of the French grands √©tablissements.https://www.ehess.fr/frhttps://historyandliterature.columbia.edu/content/ecole- des-hautes-etudes-en-sciences-sociales Originally a department of the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, an institution created in 1868 with the purpose of training academic researchers, the EHESS became an independent institution in 1975. Today its research covers the fields of Economics and Finance (through the Paris School of Economics), Cognitive Sciences, Humanities, Political Sciences, Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Development studies, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Musicology, and Philosophy of social science. The institution is concentrated on scholarly research and some of its faculty (known as \\"directeurs d'√©tudes\\") have achieved international recognition in different areas: in economics, Thomas Piketty and Nobel laureate Jean Tirole; historians such as Fernand Braudel and Lucien Febvre; anthropologists such as Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro and Marcel Mauss, sociologists such as Pierre Bourdieu, Edgar Morin and Alain Touraine; philosophers such as Jacques Derrida, and interdisciplinary scholars such as Marcel Mauss and Raymond Aron. As a higher education institution under the jurisdiction of the French Ministry of Education, the EHESS trains academic researchers and professors specialised in the social sciences. It awards graduate degrees, such as the Master of Research and the doctorate, as well as a school diploma. Some of them are awarded conjointly with institutions such as the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, the √âcole Polytechnique, the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, and some of the universities of Paris. The EHESS is a grande √©cole and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system. It evaluates students through a selection process based on the research project of the applicants. The scholars in training are free to choose their own curriculum among the large quantity of seminars offered by the school. The √©cole has a small student- faculty ratio (830 researchers for 3000 students). Most faculty belong to other institutions, mostly within the CNRS but also other schools of Universit√© PSL such as the ENS, the EPHE and the ENC, schools of Universit√© Paris-Saclay such as T√©l√©com ParisTech and the ENSAE, and some of the universities of Paris. History =√âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes= Originally part of the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes (EPHE) as its VI Section: Sciences √©conomiques et sociales, the EHESS gained autonomy as an independent higher education institution on 23 January 1975. The creation of a dedicated branch for social science research within the EPHE was catalyzed by the Annales historical school and was supported by several academic initiatives of the Rockefeller Foundation, dating to the 1920s. After WWII, the Rockefeller Foundation invested more funds in French institutions, seeking to encourage non-Marxist sociological studies. The VIth section was created in 1947, and Lucien Febvre took its head. Soon after its creation (1947), the VI Section, later EHESS, became one of the most influential shapers of contemporary historiography, area studies and social sciences methodology, thanks to the contribution of eminent scholars such as Fernand Braudel, Jacques Le Goff and Fran√ßois Furet. F. Braudel succeeded L. Febvre in 1956. He concentrated the various study groups at the well-known building on boulevard Raspail (area of all√©e Claude-Cahun-Marcel-Moore), in part by financing from the Ford Foundation. =Independent institution= Today, the EHESS is one of France's Grands √©tablissements. It functions as a research, teaching, and degree-granting institution. It offers advanced students high-level programs intended to lead to research careers. Students are admitted on the relevance of their research project and undertake at the EHESS master programs and doctoral studies. The main areas of specialization include: history, literary theory, linguistics, philosophy, philology, sociology, anthropology, economics, cognitive science, demographics, geography, archaeology, psychology, law, and mathematics. The institution's focus is on interdisciplinary research within these fields. The EHESS has more than 40 research centers (among which are several joint research units with the CNRS) and 22 doctoral programs, 13 of which are in partnership with other French Universities and Grandes √©coles. =PSL Research University= The school is a constituent college of the federal PSL Research University. Other institutions include the College de France, the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes, Chimie ParisTech, ESPCI ParisTech, the √âcole des mines, and Paris Dauphine University. Research =History = Influence from the Annales School Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel were members of the √âcole des Annales, the dominant school of historical analysis in France during the interwar period. However, this school of thought was contested by the growing importance of the social sciences and the beginning of structuralism. Under pressure from Claude L√©vi-Strauss, in particular, they integrated new contributions from the fields of sociology and ethnography to event-based historical analysis, a concept put forward by the Annales school, to advocate for the concept of \\"a nearly imperceptible passage of history\\". They were reproached, along with the structuralists, for ignoring politics and the individual's influence over his fate during a period in which the colonial wars of liberation were taking place. The work of Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie and other historians working under their influence greatly affected the research and official teaching of history in France beginning in the 1960s. The work of Jean-Marie Pesez renewed interest in the issue of methodology in medieval archeology and created the idea of \\"material culture\\". Fran√ßois Hartog, who serves as the director of the school's ancient and modern historiography department, is also noted for proposing that the problems of modern time schema are not entirely caused by an imperialist past.Lorenz, Chris; Bevernage, Berber (2013). Breaking Up Time: Negotiating the Borders Between Present, Past and Future. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. p. 209. . He is also known for challenging the Eurocentric reflection of history and the present.Diawara, Mamadou; Lategan, Bernard C.; R√ºsen, J√∂rn (2010). Historical Memory in Africa: Dealing with the Past, Reaching for the Future in an Intercultural Context. Berghahn Books. p. 88. . New History During the 1970s, EHESS became the center of New History under the influence of Jacques Le Goff and Pierre Nora. During this period, a generation of ethnologists working under the ideas of Georges Balandier and Marc Aug√© were critical of the French colonial tradition and applied modern sociological concepts to third world countries.  New Polish School of Holocaust Scholarship  In 2019, held the New Polish School of Holocaust Scholarship conference. The conference was disrupted by Polish nationalists.Par Danielle Delmaire, ¬´ Chahut lors d‚Äôun colloque sur la Shoah en Pologne ¬ª, Tsafon [En ligne], 77  2019, mis en ligne le 09 septembre 2019, consult√© le 15 d√©cembre 2019.

In France this debate is also enabled by the proximity of the researchers in Paris with national economic institutions: In this sense EHESS's advisors who have been drawn from economic professors have enjoyed a large media audience (a case example was Jean Fourasti√©). The diversity of viewpoints has been a priority, and liberal and Marxist economists have had the chance to debate in EHESS. Since the 1970s and 1980s EHESS has focused on quantitative economics, with classes led by well-known professors such as Louis-Andr√© G√©rard-Varet, Jean-Jacques Laffont, Fran√ßois Bourguignon and Roger Guesnerie. They initiated not only the Paris School of Economics but the Toulouse School of Economics and Grequam (Aix-Marseille). Organisation =Recruitment= More than 50% of the student body comes from countries other than France. Domestic and foreign networks =Affiliations= The school is a founding member of the Paris School of Economics, Toulouse School of Economics, and Aix-Marseille School of Economics, the three French leading centers in Quantitative Economics. Since 2014 it is an associated member of the Paris Research University (PSL). =International partnerships= EHESS has exchange programs with universities such as Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, Yale, Berkeley, Columbia and Michigan State in the United States, Heidelberg in Germany, Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, Peking in China, the European University Institute in Florence, etc. Also, it has many relations and exchange programs with universities in Asia and the Middle-East; it holds research centers on Asian Studies and Islamic Studies.

Originally a teacher, he was an entrepreneur who built political contacts along with a business empire, leading to various government and political positions at the state (State of Mexico) and national level. He was prevented from seeking the presidency due to laws requiring both parents to be Mexicans by birth; his father was German. He has been involved in drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption, and criminal threats.  Biography  Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez was born in Santiago Tianguistenco in the State of Mexico. He graduated from the Escuela Nacional de Toluca as a primary education teacher and from the Normal Superior (Teacher's College) de M√©xico as a professor of history and biology. From 1947 to 1951 he was a teacher at the Secundaria Federal de Atlacomulco. To supplement his income, he sold candy on the side. He grew and exchanged his small businesses into larger ones, along the way adding names of prominent politicians to his list of contacts. He founded a business empire of banking and transportation interests, including the foundation of airline Taesa. In 1999, Forbes estimated his wealth at about US$1.3 billion but other sources say that figure should be much higher. He married Guadalupe Rhon, with whom he had five children, 3 boys and 2 girls. He is the father of Carlos Hank Rhon, Cuauhtemoc Hank Rhon, and Jorge Hank Rhon and grandfather of Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez who now heads the company called Grupo Financiero Interacciones. =Career= Hank Gonz√°lez's political career began when he moved from Atlacomulco to Toluca to take charge of the State of Mexico's Departmento de Escuelas Secundarias y Profesionales (Department of Professional and Secondary Schools) as well as the Oficina de Juntas de Mejoramiento Moral, C√≠vico y Material (Office of Committees for Moral, Civic and Material Improvement) between 1952 and 1953. The following year he was in charge of the treasury for the municipality of Toluca. From 1955 to 1957 he was the president of the ayuntamiento of Toluca. His federal service began in 1961 when he became a congressman (diputado federal) for the XLIV Legislature. However, at the height of his political career, he served as the governor of the State of Mexico from 1969 to 1975 and was appointed \\"regent\\"(similar to mayor) of Mexico City in 1976. Federally, he served as Secretary of Tourism from 1988 to 1990 when he was then named as Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources. He was considered one of the leaders of the old guard wing of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) He began as chief of the Delegaci√≥n del Sector Popular at district, state and national conventions of the PRI, then was a delegate for the party for the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche and Quintana Roo. He worked his way up to be a member of the Comisi√≥n P√≥litica del Comit√© Ejecutivo Nacional, advising presidents of the party. His death not only left a vacant place in the party structure of the PRI but it also signaled the end of a cycle in Mexican politics where the PRI dominated everything. Constitutionally barred from running for the Mexican presidency by a provision then in force which excluded those with a foreign-born parent from holding the office. His father, Jorge Hank Weber, was German and a colonel in both the German and Mexican armies. However, Carlos Hank had great influence in the PRI party, culminating in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Other evidence of his wide-ranging connections came in the form of his birthday celebration every year on August 28, when \\"The professor\\" would have a grand party at his ranch called \\"Don Catarino\\" in Santiago Tianguistenco with thousands of invited guests. As mayor of Mexico City, he built the Eje vial system of roads and other projects designed to make the city more car- friendly.  Death  In 1997, Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez suffered an embolism and died in 2001 of cancer, spending the last few years of his life in the United States for treatment.  Criminal accusations  According to a report by the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) nicknamed Operation White Tiger, he -and now his two sons- are so involved in drug trafficking and money laundering that they \\"pose a significant criminal threat to the United States.\\" While U.S. law enforcement officials have spent years investigating Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his sons Carlos Hank Rhon and Jorge Hank Rhon, the assessment by several agencies marks the first time that all three have been linked directly to the operations of major Mexican drug organizations. The report drew on information from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Customs Service, CIA, Interpol and others. The report says intelligence agencies had intercepted conversations of the Hank family coordinating drug shipments. The document concludes that the Hank family has laundered money on a massive scale, assisted drug trafficking organizations in transporting drug shipments, and is engaged in large-scale public corruption, and was closely associated with the late Ju√°rez Cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes. A report by the World Policy Institute presented to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, described Carlos Hank as the \\"primary intermediary between the multinational drug trafficking enterprises and the Mexican political system\\". Following the media revelations about Operation White Tiger, the Hank family, which has denied it is linked to or protecting top Mexican narcotraffickers, lobbied the U.S. Justice Department. With the assistance of Republican former U.S. senator Warren Rudman, whom Carlos Hank Rhon hired to represent his interests in Washington, Hank secured from Reno a letter contradicting the NDIC analysis. The attorney general's retraction of an intelligence analysis based on dozens of past investigations on the Hank family and on new lines of inquiry came as a bitter disappointment to members of the San Diego-based Operation White Tiger Task Force. The Hanks and their supporters insist that Reno's intervention was just and that they have been victims of innuendo spread by their political and business rivals. From the start, agents involved in the probe feared that Washington would conclude that Operation White Tiger was too controversial and potentially too disruptive to Mexican-American relations for it to continue. They suspected it would be blocked, as previous investigations of top Mexican politicians.

It is made from lime plaster, which is rammed, polished, and treated with soap to make it waterproof and water-repellant. Tadelakt is labour-intensive to install, but durable. Since it is applied as a paste, tadelakt has a soft, undulating character, it can form curves, and it is seamless. Pigment can be added to give it any colour, but deep red is traditional. It may have a shiny or matte finish. Etymology and history The term tadelakt, meaning \\"to rub in\\", is an Amazighified expression from the Arabic word tadleek meaning \\"to rub or massage.\\" Tadelakt is thought to have evolved from qadad, a similar plaster used in Yemen for millennia that is treated with calcium hydroxide and oils and fats instead of soaps.Anita Sutter, ¬´ Note sur la fabrication du qad√¢d ¬ª, Chroniques y√©m√©nites [En ligne], 6-7  1999, mis en ligne le 18 d√©cembre 2006, consult√© le 13 f√©vrier 2016.

The soap chemically reacts with the lime plaster, forming lime (calcium) soaps. Calcium soaps are insoluble in water, and fairly hard. They are familiar, in areas with calcium-rich (\\"hard\\") water, as deposits in bathtubs, sinks, and showers; when soap is mixed with the water's dissolved calcium carbonate/lime, calcium soaps form. :2 C17H35COO‚àíNa+ \\\\+ Ca2+ ‚Üí (C17H35COO)2Ca + 2 Na+ Techniques Traditional application includes polishing with a river stone and treatment with oleic acid, in the form of olive oil soap, to lend it its final appearance and water resistance. In Morocco, the traditional application technique: * plaster powder is mixed with water for 12 to 15 hours prior to the addition of pigment. * the plaster is applied in one thick coat with a wooden float, and smoothed with the same. * before the plaster sets, a flat, smooth, hard stone is used to compress the plaster, then a plastic trowel used for the final polish. * it is mechanically polished using stones or abrasives harder than the plaster, providing a smooth, sometimes shiny, finish. * lastly, an olive-oil soap solution is used to seal the plaster Long-term maintenance of tadelakt requires regularly re- sealing the surface with a soap solution; in the case of qadad roofs, this was traditionally done every few years. Tadelakt can be elaborately carved into yeseria. Uses Tadelakt is the traditional coating of the palaces, hammams and bathrooms of the riads in Morocco. The restoration of the riads of Morocco had led to a resurgence in its use. In modern times, it has been used outside.

The film is based on the play Kind Sir written by Norman Krasna. This was Grant's and Bergman's second film together, after Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (1946), and was one of the first films to popularise artistic use of the technique of split screens. The film was remade for television in 1988 starring Robert Wagner and Lesley-Anne Down.  Synopsis  Anna Kalman (Ingrid Bergman) is an accomplished London-based theatre actress who has given up her hopes of finding the man of her dreams. Through her brother-in-law, Alfred Munson (Cecil Parker), she meets a handsome economist, Philip Adams (Cary Grant). She is instantly captivated by him and expresses visible interest in him. At the end of their first meeting, she makes a pass at him to go on a date sometime later to which he politely states that he is married. He further adds that he is separated and unable to get a divorce from his wife. Anna is seemingly unperturbed by the fact and still asks him out whereupon he agrees. They hit it off on their first date and continue seeing each other frequently. Soon after, they fall in love. Anna is then cautioned by her sister Margaret (Phyllis Calvert) about the affair but she rebuffs her approach. As their romance continues to blossom, Philip receives a temporary transfer notice to New York for his work at NATO which greatly distresses Anna as it will keep them apart for possibly five months. On the day before Philip's scheduled sail, Alfred tells Philip that he knows Philip is a bachelor from Scotland Yard investigations and asks him the reason for this secret. Philip reveals that he is unenthusiastic about the idea of marriage but can't give up on women which led him to develop this white lie. However, he assures Alfred that he sincerely loves Anna. He also tells that he plans to surprise Anna on her birthday the next day by delaying his departure by a few days and visiting her at midnight. Anna informs Alfred and Margaret that she plans to go to New York to surprise Philip. To discourage her Alfred unwillingly discloses Philip's plan. Margaret further worsens the situation by stating that Philip is actually unmarried. Anna becomes furious upon learning this as she takes this as an insult to her dignity. She decides to go on as if nothing happened but secretly concocts a plan to get even with him. She arranges an elaborate ruse where it will appear that she was having an affair with David, an old flame, when Philip comes to visit her at midnight on her birthday. But it does not go as planned when David meets an accident and she is informed that he can't come. She tries to solve it by making her elderly caretaker Carl (David Kossoff) play the part of David. Despite this, her plan goes haywire when Philip comes and actually proposes marriage to her and leaves when he mistakes Carl for David. She is absolutely distraught by this but luckily, Philip returns and she is able to clear up the confusion. She tells him that she is happy the way things are. But now Philip is adamant about getting married and tells her so. Hearing this, Anna becomes extremely happy and the film ends with the couple embracing each other.

It is part of Tacoma Public Schools, or Tacoma School District No. 10 and is located in the Stadium District, near downtown Tacoma. The original building was severely damaged by a fire in 1898 while it was still a partially-constructed hotel designed by Hewitt & Hewitt being used for storage. It was reconstructed for use as a school beginning in 1906 according to designs by Frederick Heath, News Tribune and a \\"bowl\\" stadium was added later in 1910. History Stadium High School during a 2007 renovation The main building was constructed by architects Hewitt and Hewitt for the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and the Tacoma Land Company at what was then known as Blackwell Point. Construction began in 1891 with the intention of building a luxury hotel resembling a French ch√¢teau. The Panic of 1893, however, brought construction to an abrupt halt when the Northern Pacific was faced with financial disaster. The unfinished building became a storage facility, with much of the building materials still inside. On October 11, 1898, the building was gutted by a massive fire. The walls remained standing, and the Northern Pacific began to dismantle the structure, removing some 40,000 of the unique Roman bricks manufactured by Gladding, McBean that would be used to construct still-existing train stations in Missoula, Montana, and Wallace, Idaho. The Tacoma School District purchased the gutted building on February 19, 1904, with the intent of turning it into a high school. The redesign and later renovations were planned by the school's architect, Frederick Heath. It was repaired and renovated into a school.Plaque outside the school, May 22, 1992. Consulted 16 August 2008. Despite its extraordinary locale and design, on the inside it looks, feels, and operates like a typical American high school. The reconstructed building opened on September 10, 1906, as Tacoma High School. Seven years later, the name was changed to reference the adjacent Stadium Bowl. Later additions included a circular lunchroom, an underground swimming pool, a science and industrial arts complex, a gymnasium, and a multi-story parking lot structure with tennis courts on the roof. The stadium, also designed by Frederick Heath, dates from 1910 and is in a location once known as Old Woman's Gulch. It was originally much grander than it is today, with a seating capacity of 32,000. Among those who spoke there were Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, William Jennings Bryan, and Billy Sunday.Plaque outside the stadium, May 28, 1993. Consulted 16 August 2008. The stadium was originally built in 1909‚Äì1910 using steam shovels and sluicing to move more than down the edges of the gulch to create a flat playing field of . Wooden molds were built to cast concrete for 31 rows of stadium seating surrounding the playfield. The original structure exceeded what the soil could support. A restoration project in the 1970s had to sacrifice roughly half of the seating capacity because of instability. In 1981 a burst storm drain washed away the scoreboard and the bayward end zone of the football field. This was followed by a further restoration allowing the stadium to reopen in 1985. The school was the filming location for many of the scenes of the 1999 movie 10 Things I Hate About You. In 2005-2006 the school underwent a major renovation, seismic upgrade, historical restoration, and expansion. Bassetti Architects were the design architects, and Merrit Pardini Architects (later Krei Architecture) were the architects of record for this work.Bassetti Architects During the renovation, students were temporarily relocated to the old site of Mount Tahoma High School in the south end, just over away.

Specifically it is used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Kaposi's sarcoma. It is used by injection into a vein. A liposomal formulation known as liposomal daunorubicin also exists. Common side effects include hair loss, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and inflammation of the inside of the mouth. Other severe side effects include heart disease and tissue death at the site of injection. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. Daunorubicin is in the anthracycline family of medication. It works in part by blocking the function of topoisomerase II. Daunorubicin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1979. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally isolated from bacteria of the Streptomyces type. Medical uses It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in the body. Treatment is usually performed together with other chemotherapy drugs (such as cytarabine), and its administration depends on the type of tumor and the degree of response. In addition to its major use in treating AML, daunorubicin is also used to treat neuroblastoma. Daunorubicin has been used with other chemotherapy agents to treat the blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Daunorubicin is also used as the starting material for semi- synthetic manufacturing of doxorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin.  Mechanism of action  Similar to doxorubicin, daunorubicin interacts with DNA by intercalation and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits the progression of the enzyme topoisomerase II, which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Daunorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. On binding to DNA, daunomycin intercalates, with its daunosamine residue directed toward the minor groove. It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C base pairs flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair. Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8¬∞, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs. It can also induce histone eviction from chromatin upon intercalation.  History  In the 1950s, an Italian research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to isolate anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle in Apulia. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius which produced a red pigment was isolated, and an antibiotic was produced from this bacterium that was found to have good activity against murine tumors. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color.Per prior citation, the first publication: Camerino B, Palamidessi G (1960) Derivati della parazina II. Sulfonamdopir (in Italian). Gazz Chim Ital 90:1802‚Äì1815 Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug saw success in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity. In 2015‚Äì16, a team at Ohio State University \\"showed that, by carefully manipulating strands of viral DNA, an origami structure with complex folds can be created in just 10 minutes. Incredibly, these structures are only 100 nanometers across ‚Äì that‚Äôs 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Small volumes of daunorubicin can be wrapped up in these minuscule pods, which can then be released into a leukemia cell-filled environment.\\" Route of administration Daunorubicin should only be administered in a rapid intravenous infusion. It should not be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, since it may cause extensive tissue necrosis. It should also never be administered intrathecally (into the spinal canal), as this will cause extensive damage to the nervous system and may lead to death. Daunorubicin has been used intravitreally (inside the eye) for the purposes of preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a common complication following retinal detachment surgery, but has not been found to be effective and is not used for any other ophthalmic purposes at this time.

It is thought to have been built to serve as the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Menkaure.  Size and construction  The Diagram Of the Pyramid. Menkaure's pyramid had an original height of 65.5 meters (215 feet) and was the smallest of the three major pyramids at the Giza Necropolis. It now stands at 61 m (204 ft) tall with a base of 108.5 m (356 ft). Its angle of incline is approximately 51¬∞20‚Ä≤25‚Ä≥. It was constructed of limestone and Aswan granite. The first sixteen courses of the exterior were made of the red granite. The upper portion was cased in the normal manner with Tura limestone. Part of the granite was left in the rough. Incomplete projects such as this pyramid help archaeologists understand the methods used to build pyramids and temples. South of the pyramid of Menkaure are three satellite pyramids, with each accompanied by a temple and substructure. The easternmost is the largest and a true pyramid. Its casing is partly of granite, like the main pyramid, and is believed to have been completed due to the limestone pyramidion found close by. Neither of the other two progressed beyond the construction of the inner core.Edwards, Dr. I.E.S.: The Pyramids of Egypt 1986/1947 pp. 147‚Äì163 Isometric views of the pyramid of Menkaure taken from a 3d model  Temple complex  In the mortuary temple the foundations and the inner core were made of limestone. The floors were begun with granite and granite facings were added to some of the walls. The foundations of the valley temple were made of stone. However both temples were finished with crude bricks. Reisner estimated that some of the blocks of local stone in the walls of the mortuary temple weighed as much as 220 tons, while the heaviest granite ashlars imported from Aswan weighed more than 30 tons. It was not unusual for a son or successor to complete a temple when a Pharaoh died, so it is not unreasonable to assume that Shepseskaf finished the temples with crude brick. There was an inscription in the mortuary temple that said he \\"made it (the temple) as his monument for his father, the king of upper and lower Egypt.\\" During excavations of the temples Reisner found a large number of statues mostly of Menkaure alone and as a member of a group. These were all carved in the naturalistic style of the old kingdom with a high degree of detail evident.  Age and location  Base of Menkaure's pyramid, adjacent to the northern entrance. The bottom courses of granite are visibly unfinished, probably halted in mid-work due to the death of the pharaoh. The pyramid's date of construction is unknown, because Menkaure's reign has not been accurately defined, but it was probably completed in the 26th century BC. It lies a few hundred yards southwest of its larger neighbours, the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu in the Giza necropolis.  Sarcophagus  Richard Vyse, who first visited Egypt in 1835, discovered on 28 July 1837 in the upper antechamber the remains of a wooden anthropoid coffin inscribed with Menkaure's name and containing human bones. This is now considered to be a substitute coffin from the Saite period. Radiocarbon dating on the bones determined them to be less than 2,000 years old, suggesting either an all-too- common bungled handling of remains from another site, or access to the pyramid during Roman times. Deeper into the pyramid, Vyse came upon a basalt sarcophagus, described as beautiful and rich in detail with a bold projecting cornice, which contained the bones of a young woman. Unfortunately, this sarcophagus now lies at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, having sunk on October 13, 1838, with the ship Beatrice, as she made her way between Malta and Cartagena, on the way to Great Britain. It was one of only a handful of Old Kingdom sarcophagi to survive into the modern period. The lid from the anthropoid coffin mentioned above was successfully transported to England and may be seen today at the British Museum.  Attempted demolition  The damage to the pyramid At the end of the twelfth century al-Malek al-Aziz Othman ben Yusuf, Saladin's son and heir, attempted to demolish the pyramids, starting with that of Menkaure. Workmen recruited to demolish the pyramid stayed at their job for eight months, but found it almost as expensive to destroy as to build. They could only remove one or two stones each day. Some used wedges and levers to move the stones, while others used ropes to pull them down. When a stone fell, it would bury itself in the sand, requiring extraordinary efforts to free it. Wedges were used to split the stones into several pieces, and a cart was used to carry it to the foot of the escarpment, where it was left. Despite their efforts, workmen were only able to damage the pyramid to the extent of leaving a large vertical gash at its northern face.Stewert, Desmond and editors of the Newsweek Book Division \\"The Pyramids and Sphinx\\" 1971 p. 101 Lehner, Mark The Complete Pyramids, London: Thames and Hudson (1997) p. 41 .

Between 1951 and 1958, telephone numbers were lengthened by adding one digit (3L-4N) to be compatible.http://jbb.poslfit.com/Pages/514.html Numbering plan area 514 was split in 1957 to create area code 819 for most of western Quebec, from Estrie (Sherbrooke) to the Ontario border, with the then-unserved far northern portion nominally added to 418 (and later moved to 819). 514 was reduced to the region surrounding Montreal. This configuration remained unchanged for 41 years. In 1998, the off-island suburbs (Laval, Mont√©r√©gie, etc.) received area code 450, which now completely surrounds 514. This left 514 as the Island of Montreal and a few surrounding smaller islands, making it one of the six pairs of doughnut area codes in the numbering plan, and the only one in Canada. The 1998 split was intended as a long-term solution to a shortage of available numbers in Canada's second-largest toll-free calling zone. However, within less than a decade, 514 was close to exhaustion due to the proliferation of computer, pager, and cell phone technologies, a problem exacerbated by the proliferation Canada's inefficient system of number allocation. Unlike the United States, Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Every competing carrier is assigned blocks of 10,000 telephone numbers, corresponding to a single central office prefix, in every rate centre where it plans to offer service. Once a telephone number is allocated to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be reused elsewhere, even when a rate centre has more than enough numbers to serve it. This resulted in thousands of wasted telephone numbers. Many larger cities have multiple rate centres which have never been amalgamated. Montreal is an exception; it is Canada's second- largest rate centre. The number allocation problem was not as severe in Montreal as in other areas of Canada, since numbers tend to be used up fairly quickly. However, it was apparent that the area needed another area code. On November 4, 2006, numbering plan area 514 was overlaid with area code 438. This required ten-digit dialing for all subscribers in the Montreal area, even for local calls. By this time, overlays had become the preferred relief measure in Canada, as they affect existing subscribers the least and provide a workaround for the number allocation problem. No area codes have been split in Canada since 1999. Although the number allocation problem has never been addressed, under current projections, Montreal will not need another area code until 2023.https://nationalnanpa.com/reports/2019-1_NPA%20Exhaust_Projections_Final.pdf Despite Montreal's continued growth, 514/438 is nowhere near exhaustion. Area code 438 was considered for overlaying 450 as well, but a later decision determined that 579 would be the overlay code for that area.http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2009/28/c9180.html As of February 2017, Area code 263 is reserved for a third area code in the region.

Description Collage showing a potato ricer from four angles A common variety of potato ricer resembles a large garlic press. It has two long handles, one with a perforated basket at the end, the other with a flat surface that fits into the basket. The food is placed in the basket, then the flat surface is pushed down into the basket by pressing the handles together, forcing the food through the holes.Potato Ricer. CooksInfo.com. Published 02/18/2007. Updated 05/27/2009. Web. Retrieved 11/29/2012 from http://www.cooksinfo.com/potato-ricer Another form, sometimes called a rotary ricer, is cone-shaped with small perforations all around the cone. It comes with a wooden pestle that is used to push the food through the holes. A food mill can be used as a substitute for a ricer. Uses This tool is commonly used to rice potatoes, a process that forces cooked potatoes through the ricer and turns the potatoes into fine, thin shreds. The resulting potatoes are lighter and fluffier. The process allows the full starch cells of high-starch potatoes to maintain their integrity and stay separate, giving the potatoes a fluffy, full texture. At this point, milk, butter, and other additives can easily be blended to maintain the starch structure, the result being consistent mashed potatoes. The process works since uniform texture is created due to the passing of potatoes through evenly sized holes, which ensures that the potatoes are smashed only once. With this method, the cell walls are much less likely to break open. Pressing cooked vegetables and fruits through the small holes produces a puree comparable to using a drum sieve. Many foods can now be pureed more easily in a food processor; however, a manual method such as ricing is best for potatoes, which are starchy and become glutinous when over-processed. Ricers are often used to puree food for babies. A ricer can be used to remove excess water from foods such as cooked greens that are to be added to quiche, thawed frozen spinach, and sliced or grated potatoes to improve the quality of potato chips or hash browns made from them. Ricers are also used to make Mont Blanc (a dessert of chestnut puree), lefse (a Norwegian) flatbread, sp√§tzle (German noodles), passatelli (a type of Italian pasta), and process ice cream when making the German dish spaghettieis. Potters and ceramicists use ricers to extrude \\"hair\\" for human heads or animal sculptures such as sheep.

He succeeded his half-brother, Yeonsangun, because of the latter's tyrannical misrule, which culminated in a coup placing Jungjong on the throne.  Biography  = Jo Gwang-jo's reforms = On the day Yeonsangun was deposed, soldiers belonging to the coup leaders surrounded the house of his half- brother Grand Prince Jinseong. He was about to kill himself, thinking that Yeonsangun was finally going to kill him; but, dissuaded by his wife later known as Queen Dangyeong, Grand Prince Jinseong found himself becoming the eleventh king of Joseon Dynasty, or King Jungjong. Jungjong worked hard to wipe out the remnants of the Yeonsangun era by reopening the Seonggyungwan, royal university, and Office of Censors, which criticizes inappropriate actions of the king. However, during the early days of his reign, Jungjong could not exert regal authority freely because those who put him on the throne exercised immense power. When the three main leaders of coup died of old age and natural causes eight years later, Jungjong began to assert his authority and carried out a large-scale reformation of the government with help of Jo Gwang-jo and other Sarim scholars. Jo Gwang-jo strengthened local autonomy by establishing a self-governing system called Hyang'yak, promoted Confucian writings by translating them into Korean hangul and distributing them widely, pursued a land reform that would distribute land more equally between the rich and poor, and introduced a supplementary system for recruiting talents to the government. He also believed that any talented people, including slaves, should be appointed as officials regardless of social status. As Inspector General, he enforced the laws strictly so that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the local populace during this time according to Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.Annals of Joseon Dynasty, October, 1520 However, the reforms faced much opposition from conservative nobles who led the coup in 1506 that placed Jungjong in power. After four years of reformist agenda, Jungjong abruptly abandoned Jo Gwang-jo's programs because he either lost confidence in Jo's programs or feared that Jo was becoming too powerful. While Jungjong and Jo Gwang-jo shared the reformist agenda, Jungjong was also chiefly interested in solidifying royal authority whereas the latter was more concerned with neo-Confucian ideology, according to which those who rule must be a virtuous example to the rest. Finally in November 1519, when conservative officials slandered Jo Gwang-jo to be disloyal by writing \\"Jo will become the king\\" () with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation, Jungjong executed Jo Gwang-jo on charge of factionalism and exiled many of his followers, abruptly abandoning his reforms. This incident is known as the Third Literati Purge of 1519 or Gimyo massacre of scholars. = Rule of in-laws = After Jo Gwang-jo's fall, King Jungjong never had the chance to rule on his own. His reign was marked by tumultuous struggle among various conservative factions, each of them backed by one of the King's queens or concubines. In 1524 the conservative factions collided with each other, one faction deposing the corrupt official Kim Anro. Kim Anro's followers took their revenge in 1527 by intriguing against Consort Park, one of the King's concubines, which led to her execution along with her son Prince Bokseong. Kim Anro came back to power and took revenge on his enemies until he was removed from government and then executed by the new queen's brothers, Yun Wonro and Yun Wonhyeong. However, Yun Im, ally of Kim Anro, was able to keep his nephew as crown prince since the new queen, Queen Munjeong, did not have a son until later. Injong would later be declared the crown prince. His uncle Yun Im competed for power with the Queen Munjeong 's brothers, Yun Won-hyeong and Yun Won-ro. Many officials and scholars gathered around the two centers of power and each group developed into separate political factions. Yun Im's faction became known as ‚ÄòGreater Yun‚Äô and the Yun brothers' faction as ‚ÄòLesser Yun‚Äô. Their conflict led to the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545 after Jungjong's death. As the dynasty weakened as a consequence of the continual internal conflict, foreign powers driven away by earlier monarchs returned with much greater effect. Wokou pirates and privateers often plundered southern coastal regions, while the Jurchens attacked the northern frontier numerous times, bleeding the army dry. = Assessment = Jungjong was a good and able administrator especially during the reform period led by Jo Gwang-jo. However, historians judge that he was a fundamentally weak king due to circumstances of his ascension to throne, too easily swayed by both Jo Gwang-jo and conservative ministers who placed him on the throne. Sometimes he was seen as a tragic figure who never wanted to be a king but was forced to become one and depose his loving queen under the pressure of the coup leaders, who killed her father during the coup. More recently, some historians have suggested that Jungjong was not actually manipulated by his ministers and in- laws, but rather used them to get rid of one another to strengthen regal authority albeit not so successfully. In either case, his reign was marred by much confusion, violence, corruption, and court intrigues. He has been especially criticized for allowing the Third Literati Purge of 1519 and executing Jo Gwang-jo and others on framed charges. In the early days of reform, Jungjong encouraged the publishing of many books; but publications declined dramatically after the literati purge in 1519. He also tried to improve self-government of local areas and succeeded in reforming the civil service examination. In the latter days of his reign, he realized the importance of defense and encouraged military service.

He batted and threw right-handed. Cuddyer was a two-time MLB All-Star, and won a Silver Slugger Award in 2013, when he led the National League in batting average. Cuddyer announced his retirement after the 2015 season. He was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame on August 19, 2017. Early life Cuddyer was born in Norfolk, Virginia and is a 1997 graduate of Great Bridge High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he was a standout athlete in baseball, basketball, and football as well as student body president and National Honor Society member. In 1997, he was named to the All-America First Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association and Rawlings. Cuddyer was named Virginia's Player of the Year and Gatorade National baseball Player of the Year in 1997. He was also a member of USA Todays All-Star and the USA Junior National teams in 1997. During his high school career, he played American Legion Baseball and was named the 2014 American Legion Graduate of the Year. Cuddyer has given back to his hometown and high school many times during his career.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2016/01/18/cuddyer- enjoying-life-after-mlb/78952900/ Professional career =Minnesota Twins= Cuddyer was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 1st round (9th pick) of the 1997 amateur draft, but did not sign until August. Cuddyer initially committed to play college baseball at Florida State but waited for the Twins' signing bonus offer to increase from $700,000 to $1.3 million before deciding to go professional. Consequently, he did not make his professional debut until 1998 when he was assigned to the Fort Wayne Wizards in the single-A Midwest League. Showing the tools that made him a first round draft pick and regularly named to the Baseball America's top minor league prospects, Cuddyer made steady progress through the Twins' minor league system and made his Major League Baseball debut on September 23, 2001 after hitting .301 with 30 home runs and 87 RBI in 141 games at AA New Britain. After hitting .309 with 20 home runs in 86 games at AAA Edmonton, Cuddyer would be called back up with the Twins for the 2002 stretch drive and would be named to the post-season roster where he would hit over .300 against the Oakland A's and the Anaheim Angels. Despite playing over half of his 676 minor league games at third base and another 166 games at second, prior to the 2004 season Cuddyer got most of his playing time as an occasional fill-in in the outfield. During 2004, Cuddyer started to see more time in the majors in the infield, playing second and third base. After the departure of veteran Twins third baseman Corey Koskie to the Toronto Blue Jays by way of free agency in 2005, Cuddyer became the Twins' starting third baseman. However, he struggled at third base and was relegated to a reserve role for much of 2005, although he did hit .263 with 12 home runs for the second season in a row. Cuddyer underwent surgery to repair a tear in his right lateral meniscus in October 2005. The Twins then extended his contract on January 21, 2006, giving him a one-year deal worth $1.3 million. After beginning the 2006 season on the bench, Cuddyer emerged as a regular in right field and in the cleanup spot of the Twins batting order. He finished second to Justin Morneau in RBI for the Twins in 2006. Prior to the 2008 season, Cuddyer re-signed with the Twins with a three-year $24 million contract, with a $10.5 million club option for 2011. On April 4, 2008, Cuddyer suffered a dislocated right index finger after sliding headfirst into third base. He also suffered a laceration on the knuckle after getting stepped on by Kansas City Royals third baseman Alex Gordon. He was put on the 15-day disabled list and was activated on April 25 against the Texas Rangers. On his second game after being activated, Cuddyer hit a three-run home run off Rangers' Scott Feldman, his first of the 2008 season. On May 22, 2009 Cuddyer hit for the cycle in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Three months later, on August 23, 2009, Cuddyer hit two home runs in the same inning, the seventh inning of the Twins' game against the Kansas City Royals, becoming the 53rd player in Major League Baseball to accomplish this feat. He is the only player in major league history to have performed both offensive rarities in the same baseball season. During September and October 2009, Cuddyer moved back into the infield playing first base filling in for Justin Morneau. Cuddyer returned to the outfield at the start of the 2010 season, but also found playing time at first and third base. On July 3, 2011, Cuddyer was named an All-Star for the first time as a managers' pick. On July 25, Cuddyer became the first Twins position player to pitch in a game in 21 years when he was inserted in the eighth inning of a Twins loss against the Texas Rangers, in which they lost 20‚Äì6. The right- hander gave up a double to Mike Napoli, a bloop single to Mitch Moreland, and walked Ian Kinsler with one out to load the bases. Cuddyer then retired Elvis Andrus on a fly ball and David Murphy on a pop-up for a scoreless inning. The last Twins position player to pitch was outfielder John Moses against the California Angels on July 31, 1990. =Colorado Rockies= Colorado Rockies in 2013 On December 16, 2011, Cuddyer signed a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the Colorado Rockies.USAToday.com Retrieved on December 16, 2011. He chose to wear number 3 in order to honor Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew, with whom he had grown close within the Twins organization before Killebrew's death. Retrieved on December 20, 2011. In 2013, Cuddyer set a personal best with a 27-game hitting streak, the longest in Rockies history to that point. Cuddyer was also named an All-Star for the second time in his career. Cuddyer finished the 2013 regular season with a .331 batting average to win the batting title by 10 points over Atlanta's Chris Johnson. It was the 34-year- old outfielder's first batting title as the highest Cuddyer had hit in a season before 2013 was .285. On August 17, 2014, Cuddyer again hit for the cycle, becoming the 30th player to hit for the cycle more than once and just the third player in history, after John Olerud and Bob Watson, to hit for the cycle in both the American and National Leagues. Cuddyer was the only player to hit for the cycle during the 2014 season. =New York Mets= Cuddyer signed a two-year contract with the New York Mets on November 10, 2014 worth $21 million. On July 24, 2015 Cuddyer was put on the 15 day disabled list due to a bone bruise in his left knee. With the Mets in 2015, Cuddyer appeared in the first World Series of his career, but the team would lose the series four games to one to the Kansas City Royals. On December 11, 2015, Cuddyer announced his retirement via an article on The Players' Tribune titled \\"Play Hard and Dream Big\\". =Career statistics= In 1536 games over 15 seasons, Cuddyer posted a .277 batting average (1522-for-5488) with 809 runs, 333 doubles, 42 triples, 197 home runs, 794 RBI, 75 stolen bases, 527 bases on balls, .344 on-base percentage and .461 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage plying at all three outfield positions and first, second and third base. In 28 postseason games, he hit .306 (26-for-85) with 5 runs, 2 home runs and 8 RBI. Personal life Michael is the son of Henry Cuddyer and Marcia Harris. He has a younger sister named Katie. He married Claudia Rente, an English teacher, on November 11, 2006. She has worked for both Hickory High School and Great Bridge High School. Son, Casey Jonathan, was born on June 20, 2008, and fraternal twin daughters, Chloe and Madeline, were born on December 6, 2011. Due to a childhood virus, Cuddyer has been deaf in his left ear since he was eleven years old. However, he insists that his partial deafness has never interfered with his ability to hear teammates on the field and he does not view himself as hearing impaired.

History  Artstor logo Since 2003, the organization has been an independent non-profit 501(C)(3) organization based in New York. Starting in 2016, it joined in a strategic alliance with Ithaka Harbors, which currently operates the services JSTOR, Portico, and Ithaka S+R. In the late 1990s, as universities and libraries began to convert their slide libraries into local digital image databases, Artstor was created to address the growing need for a shared online image library that would be accessible to educational institutions worldwide. The Artstor Digital Library is intended to reduce redundant efforts of scanning and cataloging thousands of the same images from multiple repositories, and also to enable new digital image collections to be shared for teaching and research. The initiative paired innovative digital image and online technologies with Mellon Foundation‚Äôs ongoing mission to support higher education, museums, the arts, and art conservation to ‚Äúbring about a substantial transformation in art-related teaching, learning, and research.‚Äù Artstor's primary goals as an organization are: to assemble image collections from across many time periods and cultures; to create an organized, central, and reliable digital resource that supports strictly non-commercial use of images for research, teaching and learning; and to work with the arts and educational communities to develop collective solutions for building, managing and sharing digital images for educational use. Like many non-profits, Artstor has a mixed business model; some services are provided on a fee basis (geared toward the size of the subscribing institution) and others are provided free of charge to the community.  Digital Library  The Artstor Digital Library includes a set of software tools to view, present, and manage images for research and teaching purposes. There are currently more than 1,500 Artstor institutional subscribers in over 45 countries, including colleges and universities, museums, libraries, primary and secondary schools, and other non-profit organizations. The Artstor Digital Library offers a wide range of images needed for interdisciplinary teaching and research, including contributions from the leading museums, photo archives, libraries, scholars, photographers, artists, and artists‚Äô estates. These diverse collections include: Magnum Photos, Carnegie Arts of the United States, The Illustrated Bartsch, the Mellon International Dunhuang Archive, The Huntington Archive of Asian Art, and The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Architecture and Design Collection, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Bodleian Library, and more. The Digital Library comprises more than one million images from hundreds of collections worldwide. The Digital Library is continually expanded by new contributions such as: Mark Rothko Estate; Latin American Art (Cisneros Collection); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA); Christopher Roy: African Art and Architecture; Berlin State Museums; the Gernsheim Corpus of Master Drawings (185,000 images of old master drawings); Larry Qualls Archive (100,000 images documenting 30 years of New York City gallery exhibitions); architectural photography from Esto, Canyonlights and ART on FILE; university collections from Harvard and Yale; and historical photo archives such as the National Gallery of Art and Frick Art Reference Library, among many others. Tools and features Artstor users have the ability to search, organize, present, upload, and share images. In addition to keyword and advanced searching, users may browse works by geography, classification, or collection name. Users can zoom in on high-resolution images in the image viewer and review related information in image data records. They can also export images for use in classroom presentations and other non-commercial, educational uses, either as JPEGs, or presentations for PowerPoint 2007. Artstor has also developed the Offline Image Viewer (OIV), an alternative tool for giving offline classroom presentations. OIV allows users to download much larger images from Artstor, combine Artstor images with their own content to create digital slide show presentations that feature side-by-side comparisons, zooming and panning, and the ability to customize text on the slides. OIV enables instructors to give reliable classroom presentations using both high- resolution Artstor images and local content without being connected to the Internet. The Artstor Digital Library is accessible through Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android-powered devices, providing read-only features such as searching and browsing, zooming, and viewing saved image groups.  Shared Shelf  Artstor also provides Shared Shelf, a Web-based cataloging and digital media management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections. Shared Shelf was launched in 2011. Artstor worked with ten institutional partners to develop this service: Bard College, Colby College, Cornell University, Harvard University, Middlebury College, New York University, Society of Architectural Historians, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Miami, and Yale University.  Other initiatives  As part of Artstor's mission of using digital technologies to further education, scholarship, and research worldwide, the organization collaborates with other institutions in the community to offer a number of services, many of them free. Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) Through a collaboration with Artstor, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is providing free access to more than 10,000 high-quality images and data records from six leading museums: the Dallas Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Samuel H. Kress Collection at the National Gallery of Art, the Walters Art Museum, the Yale Center for British Art and the Yale University Art Gallery. Images for Academic Publishing (IAP) Artstor‚Äôs Images for Academic Publishing (IAP) program makes available publication-quality images for use in scholarly publications free of charge. The IAP program was initiated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2007 and is now available as an optional service to all museums who contribute images to the Artstor Digital Library. Scholars can access these images through the Artstor Digital Library at subscribing institutions or can request free access to IAP by contacting Artstor. Current IAP contributors include Frank Cancian (University of California, Irvine) (forthcoming), Dallas Museum of Art, Getty Research Institute, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Mellink Archive (Bryn Mawr College), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Northwestern University Library, Princeton University Art Museum (forthcoming), the Walters Art Museum, and the Yale University Art Gallery. Built Works Registry (BWR) Artstor and the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University are collaborating on the creation of the Built Works Registry (BWR), a community-generated data resource for architectural works and the built environment. The BWR‚Äôs goal is to create the system and tools to enable the gathering and widespread dissemination of a large and growing body of built works information. It will serve scholars, students, educators, librarians, and catalogers from academic and cultural heritage organizations worldwide, and will be openly accessible to the general public. The project is supported by a three-year National Leadership grant awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The Getty Research Institute (GRI), nine other institutions, and an international advisory board will also participate throughout the three-year project development cycle. BWR data will be contributed to the Getty Vocabulary Program‚Äôs Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA) and will be a critical component to the controlled vocabulary warehouse in Shared Shelf. Society of Architectural Historians Architecture Resources Archive (SAHARA) The SAH Architecture Resources Archive (SAHARA), an online library of architectural and landscape images for research and teaching, is a collaboration among The Society of Architectural Historians (SAH), scholars of architectural history, librarians, and Artstor, funded by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. EMET (Embedded Metadata Extraction Tool) EMET is a software tool that is freely available for download as a stand-alone application. EMET is intended to facilitate management and preservation of digital images and their incorporation into external databases and applications. EMET was created by Artstor through funding from the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP). For programmers interested in reviewing and customizing the code, EMET is also available as an open source application on SourceForge.  References   Further reading   * Brunning, Dennis.

History  HCRO was founded in the late 1950s by the newly created Radio Astronomy Laboratory (an Organized Research Unit of the Astronomy Department at the University of California, Berkeley). An 85-foot antenna was installed in 1962 and operated until 1993, when it collapsed during a wind storm. Using it, astronomers discovered the first astrophysical maser. The university managed the facility until 2012, when SRI International assumed site management.\\"UC Berkeley Passes Management Of Allen Telescope Array To SRI\\", Space Daily, April 19, 2012 The earliest experiments in millimeter-wave astronomy were performed at this site starting in the 1970s when a 2-element interferometer was constructed. From 1980-1985 a 3-element interferometer was constructed, with another four antennas added between 1990-1992. After the 85-foot dish was lost, another three antennas were added to the millimeter array for a total of 10 elements. This came to be known as BIMA. The BIMA telescopes were moved in the spring of 2005 to be combined with other millimeter antennas as part of the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) project and to make way for the Allen Telescope Array (ATA).

A spring ice jam on the Winisk River caused flood waters to reach as far as six kilometers inland, sending every structure but two into Hudson Bay. Many residents were caught by surprise. Massive boulders of ice were carried by the torrent through town, completely enveloped by the swollen river. Several were injured and two were killed. One man drowned and one woman was crushed by ice. Relief efforts were difficult, as few roads existed in the isolated settlement. Residents had no escape from the town, which was connected to the greater world only by a small helipad. While the flood had spared this infrastructure, it proved inadequate for effective rescue of the town's population. Some residents were stranded in canoes for days while rescue conducted by The Department of Indian and Northern Affairs airlifted victims between the disaster and the helipad. A Chinook helicopter from the Ottawa-based 450 Squadron was also at Winisk for a week bringing in supplies from Kapuskasing. An inquest was launched as a result of the disaster. Several recommendations were made, including more effective surveillance of river conditions, the implementation of an early flood warning system, emergency transportation adequate to serve its population, and a pre-planned escape route. Communication was also cited as an issue. Many northern communities did not even possess a CB radio. The community's isolation contributed to its neglect in flood protection. Winisk was abandoned, and the community was later rebuilt thirty kilometers up-river on higher ground. The new settlement was renamed Peawanuck, meaning \\"flintstone\\" in the Cree language.

It is an islet in the eastern Bahamas, northeast of Acklins Island. About long and up to wide with an area of about it is bound by reefs. The verdant cay has long been uninhabited, but figurines, pottery shards, and other artifacts discovered there in the mid-1980s have been ascribed to Lucayan Indians, who lived on the cay around the time of Columbus's voyages. The indigenous people of the island on which Columbus first landed called it \\"Guanahani.\\" Samana Cay was first proposed to be Guanahani by Gustavus Fox in 1882, but the predominant theory gives the honour to San Salvador Island.William D. Phillips Jr., 'Columbus, Christopher', in David Buisseret (ed.), The Oxford Companion to World Exploration, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, online edition 2012). However, in 1986, Joseph Judge of National Geographic Magazine made different calculations based on extracts from Columbus's logs and argued for Samana Cay as the location, but his methodology has also been criticised.For a brief discussion of the controversy, see William D. Phillips, Jr., and Carla Rahn Phillips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 155‚Äì5. Samana was a name of apparent Lucayan origin (meaning \\"Small Middle Forest\\") used by the Spanish to designate one of the islands in the Bahamas.

The film's initial German title was , the German term for the character of the \\"Wandering Jew\\" in medieval folklore. The film was directed by Fritz Hippler at the insistence of Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. With a screenplay credited to Eberhard Taubert and narrated by Harry Giese, the film consists of feature and documentary footage combined with materials filmed shortly after the Nazi occupation of Poland. At this time, Poland's Jewish population was about three million, roughly ten percent of the total population. Background The interior of the exhibition The Eternal Jew (1937/1938) Poster for The Eternal Jew exhibition, 1937 Hitler and Goebbels believed that film was a vital tool for molding public opinion. The Nazis first established a film department in 1930 and Goebbels had taken a personal interest in the use of film to promote the Nazi philosophy and agenda. Soon after the Nazi takeover, Goebbels insisted in speeches that the role of the German cinema was to serve as the \\"vanguard of the Nazi military\\". The Goebbels film appears to have been intended as a violently antisemitic version of the British film The Wandering Jew, which argued that Jews were victims of relentless persecution throughout history. Saul Friedl√§nder suggests that Goebbels' intent was to counter three films: Jew S√ºss, The House of Rothschild, and The Wandering Jew. These three films, all released in 1933‚Äì34, showed that Jews were persecuted throughout history; the Goebbels films presented the opposite message. In 1937, a special wing of the Propaganda Ministry put on an art exhibition in Munich titled Der ewige Jude. It followed this up with the publication of a book of the same title, consisting of 265 photographs, each with a derogatory caption asserting the degeneracy of the Jewish race. In November 1938, Goebbels made a series of attacks against the Jews in the German media that were a factor which resulted in the pogrom known as Kristallnacht. Despite the emotional satisfaction afforded the Nazis by carrying out their antisemitism with direct violence, Kristallnacht was considered by Hitler to have been a political disaster both within Germany and internationally. Not only did the brutality indirectly caused by Goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally, the mixed reaction in the German media showed a lack of broad-based support among Germans for antisemitism and violence. Hitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should \\"elucidate events of foreign policy\\" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews. In response to Hitler's harsh reprimand, Goebbels launched a campaign to promote the antisemitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an antisemitic film. In the case of The Eternal Jew, Goebbels conceived of a film that would communicate to the German people the same antisemitic message that had been the theme of the 1937 Munich exhibition. Hitler preferred films such as The Eternal Jew which presented the Nazi antisemitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straightforward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching antisemitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal. The film Jud S√º√ü is an example of Goebbels' preferred approach. Production Although Goebbels did not generally take an active role in the production of particular films, he elected to do so in the case of major propaganda films such as The Eternal Jew. The film was in production for over a year. Throughout the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Goebbels devoted \\"constant attention\\" to the production of what he referred to as \\"the Jew film\\". As early as 1938, Goebbels had wanted to have a film crew travel to Poland to shoot the ghetto scenes; however, he was unable to gain permission from the Polish government. In October and November 1939, almost immediately after the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, he instructed Hippler to send camera crews to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Warsaw, Cracow and Lublin to shoot footage of Polish Jews. The footage that Hippler shot in the Jewish ghettos of those cities in German-occupied Poland was the only footage shot specifically for the purpose of the film. At the beginning of the film, animated text informs the audience that this \\"documentary footage\\" shows Jews in their original state \\"before they put on the mask of civilized Europeans.\\" In the Nazi press, Hippler expanded on this claim, asserting that his filming techniques captured Jews \\"in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings.\\" Although Hippler advertised the film as being a factual documentary consisting of pictures of real Jews with nothing faked or simulated, his claims were complete falsehoods. In reality, the film was an exercise in manipulation for the purposes of propaganda. In shooting his footage, Hippler did in fact simulate scenes and use actors who were performing under duress and without knowledge of how the footage would be employed. For example, in order to get shots of Jewish worship services, Hippler and Goebbels assembled the congregation of the Vilker synagogue, ordered them to wear the tallithim and tefillin and hold a full-scale service. When the Germans ordered the Torah reader to read from the Torah, he started by saying on camera \\"Today is Tuesday\\" signalling that his reading of the Torah was coerced since it was not customary to read the Torah on Tuesdays. Aside from the footage shot in Poland, the rest of the film consisted of stills and archival footage from feature films (often without permission) that the film presented as if they were documentary footage. Format and structure The movie was produced in a documentary format and, like other Hippler films, relied heavily on narration. The film can be roughly divided into four thematic areas: * Recordings from Polish ghettos * Enumeration and evaluation of numerous political, cultural and social values in the international arena of Jewish origin * Religious ceremonies, religious instruction, worship, ritual slaughter * Adolf Hitler's Reichstag speech, parading SA troops Themes Richard Barsam writes the film's \\"essential contrast is between myths and stereotypes of Jews and the Nazi ideal of a 'master race,' between the alleged inferiority of the Jews and the superiority of the Germans.\\" According to Stephen Fritz, Goebbels' intent was to create a film that would serve as \\"both a demonstration of the parasitical nature of the Jews and a justification for drastic measures against them.\\" Maria Tatar writes that the Nazis were able to use Hippler's film to \\"position the victims of their genocidal project as dangerous aggressors who had to be exterminated.\\" Similarly, Barsam describes the film as arguing that \\"Jews are criminals;... they have no soul;... they are different in every way;... killing them is not a crime, but a necessity‚Äîjust as killing rats is a necessity to preserve health and cleanliness.\\" Unser Wille und Weg (Our Will and Way), a Nazi Party monthly publication aimed at propagandists, provides a rationale for why The Eternal Jew was made. The author of the essay \\"The Film of a 2000-Year Rat Migration,\\" who remains anonymous, believes the film shows \\"a full picture of Jewry\\" and provides \\"the best treatment of this parasitic race.\\" The author connects the Jews' migration from the Middle East to Egypt and their following of German colonists to rats traveling as a group, who \\"even then displayed the same criminal traits that they still displayed\\". The film is complimented for \\"its portrayal of the Jews' vulgar methods and the brutality and all-devouring hatred they exhibit when they reach their goal and control finance.\\" The slaughtering method causes the author to question the \\"so-called Jewish religion\\", as butchers do their work with grins on their face. In closing, the author states the film will be a valuable tool in the struggle to break the Jews' \\"power over us. We are the initiators of the fight against world Jewry, which now directs its hate, its brutal greed and destructive will toward us. We must win this battle for ourselves, for Europe, for the world.\\" =Jews as an uncivilized and parasitic people= Photographs such as this served to record the horrors of life in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto for posterity Ghetto children Richard Taylor describes the basic tenet of the film as arguing that \\"the Jew is an oriental barbarian who has insinuated himself cleverly into European society, and now exploits it parasitically.\\" This point is emphasized throughout the film, starting from the very opening lines of the film's commentary: > The \\"civilized\\" Jews that we know in Germany give us only an incomplete > picture of their racial character. This film shows genuine shots of the > Polish ghettos. It shows the Jews as they really are, before they conceal > themselves behind the mask of the civilized European. Following this commentary, the film provides a succession of scenes in which Jews are portrayed as an uncivilized, parasitic people with low social standing. The images were mostly shot on site in the Warsaw Ghetto and other Polish ghettos, showing subjects who were deliberately chosen to be poorly dressed, dirty and who had partially toothless grins. The locations shown are dirty and infested by vermin. Robert Reimer asserts that a central theme of the film is the assertion that \\"Jews have always lived in the ghettos and in fact they choose to live this way.\\" According to Reimer, the film asserts that ghettos are \\"ordinary [and] normal\\" aspects of Jewish life. Reimer charges that what the film is actually showing is not the normal life of Polish Jewry but rather the \\"effect of the Nazi administration and the disruption of the lives of millions of Polish Jews.\\" Erik Barnouw describes the Warsaw Ghetto after the Nazi conquest as a place where \\"hundreds of thousands of Jews were herded by the Nazi conquerors into pockets of indescribable misery.\\" He describes footage shot there as showing \\"half-starved, unshaven creatures caught in pathetic acts of barter ‚Äì a pair of socks for a scrap of food.\\" It is scenes such as these that the film presents as showing Jews \\"in their natural state.\\" The film utilizes a montage that juxtaposes these images of ghetto Jews with images of rats to draw an analogy between the migration of Jews from Eastern Europe with the migration of rats. For example, one of the shots shows a pack of rats emerging from a sewer, followed by a shot of a crowd of Jews in a bustling street of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto. Close-ups of those in the crowd reveal sickly, malformed facial features. The narrator states that, as rats are the vermin of the animal kingdom, Jews are the vermin of the human race and similarly spread disease and corruption. Unlike rats, however, the narrator continues, Jews have the uncanny ability to change their appearance and blend into their \\"human hosts.\\" A scene depicts four bearded men in traditional religious Jewish clothing, then shows them shaved and in modern business suits, while the narrator explains that only a \\"trained eye\\" can distinguish their Jewish features. > \\"Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and > foodstuffs. In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid > fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on. They are cunning, cowardly and cruel > and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the > rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction ‚Äì just like the Jews among > human beings.\\" The film also claims that: > [Jewish people] need other people because they need the goods with which to > carry on business. The things that are valued by the creative Aryan peoples > have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, > which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. He leaves production to > the labourers and peasants of the people upon whom he has imposed his > presence. The Jews are a race without farmers and without manual labourers, > a race of parasites. According to Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany: > By showing the way in which Jews allegedly insinuate themselves from small- > scale to large-scale operations by preying on others, the film returns to > its original image of the Jew concealing himself 'behind the mask of the > civilised European'. [...] According to the film, the Jew presents an > insidious, because concealed, threat, and one that is growing and must be > brought under control. The message of this part of the commentary is that > Jews will always be Jews, and that the 'civilised European' Jew is only a > guise for a new and more dangerous forms of parasitic exploitation. =Jews as manipulative= Changing outward appearances The film also claims that the Jewish people ... > ...change their outward appearances when they leave their Polish nests and > go out into the rich world. [...] When he appears without them, then it is > only the keen-eyed amongst us who recognise his racial origins. [...] It is > true that their fathers and grandfathers still lived in ghettoes, but there > is no trace left now in their external appearance. Here in the second and > third generation, the Aryanisation has reached its zenith. [...] And people > lacking in intuition allow themselves to be deceived by this mimicry and > regard them as being in truth their equals. Therein lies the dreadful > danger, for even these 'civilised' Jews remain foreign bodies in the > organism of their hosts, no matter how much their outward appearance may > correspond to that of their hosts. Economic impact The film claims: > \\"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews sit at the junction of the > world financial markets. They are an international power. Only one percent > of the world's population, with the help of their capital they terrorize the > world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics.\\" The movie blamed Jews for inflation and unemployment in Germany. It charged that they had crept into all professions through usury, racketeering and crimes against German assets. > \\"Out of a thousand workers in Berlin, only two were Jews. For the start of > 1933, out of one hundred prosecutors in Berlin 15 were Jews. Out of a > hundred judges were 23 Jews. Out of a hundred lawyers 49 Jews. 52 Jews out > of a hundred doctors. And out of every hundred of businessmen 60 Jews. The > average wealth of Germans was 810 marks each. The average wealth of each Jew > amounted to 10,000 marks.\\" The evidence for these assertions is unstated in the film. The occupational information is found in Germany's June 1933 census, which proves the claims made in the movie to be greatly exaggerated.Margarete Limberg and Hubert R√ºbsaat, eds., Germans No More: Accounts of Jewish Everyday Life, 1933-1938, trans. Alan Nothnagle (New York: Berghahn Books, 2006), 1. In 1933, 5,600 Jewish doctors and 3,030 Jewish lawyers were practicing in Germany, corresponding to 11 percent of doctors and 16 percent of lawyers. Still, an exceptionally large number of successful lawsuits over equal citizenship and rights had been filed in the Weimar Republic, most of them by Jewish lawyers. The Nuremberg Laws specifically forbade German judges from citing any precedents by Jewish jurists and cut off Jewish doctors from reimbursement under public health care insurance. In contrast, during the economic crisis between the end of World War I and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were disproportionately likely to be laid off from the labor market, to the point that 1 out of every 4 Jews had been laid off by 1935. The original set of layoffs also had the effect of concentrating Jewish employment during this period into the professional and self-employed sectors, while post-1933 delicensing and other Nuremberg legislation gradually pushed Jews completely out of professional occupations and into positions such as street peddlers. The reference to average wealth probably used the wealth of the Jewish Rothschild family as the basis for its calculation. The Rothschild banking family is still believed to have had the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century, as well as the largest fortune in modern world history.The House of Rothschild: Money's prophets, 1798‚Äì1848, Volume 1, Niall Ferguson, 1999, page 481-85The Secret Life of the Jazz Baroness, from The Times 11 April 2009, Rosie Boycott Although the Creditanstalt debts were assumed in part by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, its bankruptcy was later used by Hitler as an example of how the Jews were responsible for all the economic and social troubles of Germany and the world. The movie goes on to assert that: \\"The most common expressions in the jargon of international gangsters and criminals stem from Hebrew and Yiddish words.\\" According to the movie, Jews are likewise disproportionately plentiful in organized crime, where they represent 82% of international crime organizations, and 98% of international prostitution. This Jewish influence is seen as well in the international language used by criminals (see also Rotwelsch). The evidence for these blatant assertions is nowhere produced. Insofar as \\"organized crime\\" represents lawbreaking other than that forced by the Nuremberg Laws, it has not been corroborated by subsequent research. The film also claims that the Jewish people have some kind of \\"genetic predisposition towards barter and haggling\\", saying that \\"[Jewish people] rush into trade\\" because it is fitting \\"with their character and inclination\\", and that \\"For the Jew, there is but one object of value ‚Äì money. How he earns it is a matter of complete indifference to him.\\" It also accuses Jews of passing corruption on to their children by religious means, saying that: > These children see no ideals before them like our own. The egoism of the > individual is not used in the service of higher common goals. On the > contrary, Jewish racial morality claims, in contrast to Aryan morality, that > the unrestrained egoism of each Jew is a divine law. His religion makes a > duty out of treachery and usury. =Jews as abnormal and depraved= In a long sequence of images, the film provides examples to illustrate its claims that Aryan/European culture had been corrupted by Jews. This sequence includes footage of notable figures who had earned Adolf Hitler's wrath, such as physicist and Nobel laureate Albert Einstein and Spartacist uprising leader Rosa Luxemburg (erroneously named as one and the same person as anarchist Emma Goldman) as representatives of so- called \\"international Jewry\\". Einstein's image was juxtaposed with a series of images about the supposed Jewish control of the pornography industry. Einstein was characterized as \\"the relativity Jew, who masks his hatred of Germany behind his obscure pseudo-sciences\\". Other film clips presented Jewish (or supposedly Jewish) actors from the Weimar era such as Curt Bois, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Ernst Lubitsch. Charlie Chaplin was also included in this sequence and inaccurately identified as Jewish, possibly as a consequence of his role as the Jewish barber in The Great Dictator. The film includes two scenes from the Hollywood film The House of Rothschild (1934). The first clip shows Mayer Rothschild, a rich man, hiding money and putting on old, shabby clothes in order to fool a corrupt tax collector. And the second shows him speaking to his sons, encouraging them to start an international banking business to take advantage of nations' misfortunes in times of war. The clips were used without permission. The film's narrator asserts that: \\"the Jew is instinctively interested in everything abnormal and depraved.\\" To illustrate this point, Hippler included a scene from Fritz Lang's film M in which the child murderer Hans Beckert (played by Peter Lorre) makes an impassioned plea to the \\"jury\\" of criminals, begging for his life and disclaiming responsibility for his crimes on account of insanity. Beckert shrieks, \\"... it burns within me. I must go the way I am driven. Who knows what is going on inside me? How I must ‚Äì not want, must!\\" According to Sharon Packer, Hitler used this scene to assert that \\"Jews transmit inheritable criminality and therefore deserve to die.\\" =Degenerate art= The film proceeds to suggest that pictorial art and music have degenerated under Jewish influence, with many spurious examples given. Degenerate art included works of abstract art as well as those from specific individuals such as George Grosz and Emil Nolde, while degenerate music included jazz and so-called Negermusik, although here the connection to Jewry is unknown. =Jewish religious practice= After showing how Jews have supposedly been responsible for the decline of Western music, science, art, and commerce, the film presents a scene of a cow being slaughtered for meat by a shochet (Jewish ritual slaughterer). The scene is prefaced by a warning similar to the one in Frankenstein, warning the squeamish about what is coming next. This long sequence, lasting several minutes, shows cows and sheep in their death throes as they bleed to death. The producers apparently filmed this scene because of Hitler's opposition to cruelty to animals. He had banned kosher slaughter of animals in Germany and felt that such footage would shock the German public. This scene was cut from the version intended for young audiences. > \\"These images are a clear proof of the cruelty of Sch√§chtmethode. They also > reveal the character of a race, their blunt brutality hidden under the guise > of religious worship. \\" The audience giving a Nazi salute during the speech =Hitler's Reichstag speech= The film concludes with footage of Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech in which he proclaims: > \\"If international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in > plunging the nations once more into a world war, the result will not be > Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the > annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\\" The film ends with images of brownshirted SA troops on parade. Release and reception In and of itself, the movie did not have much impact on the German public. The film suffered from being released after Jud S√º√ü, which had been wildly popular, perhaps because the antisemitic message was secondary to an engaging period drama. The actors in Jud S√º√ü were leading German actors of the time. In contrast, Der ewige Jude only original footage was of Jews in the Polish ghetto and animated maps. All the other footage consisted of stills and archive film clips. Thus, unlike Jud S√º√ü, which was a box-office smash success, Der ewige Jude was a commercial flop. David Culbert asserts that it is unlikely that there were more than one million paid admissions compared to over 20 million paid admissions to Jud S√º√ü. The film was more known by word- of-mouth descriptions than from people actually viewing it. Some Germans were quoted as saying \\"We've already seen enough Jewish filth. We don't need to see any more.\\" The film was chiefly screened by party supporters and Nazi organizations like the Hitler Youth and the SS. Its themes and content made it a topic of discussion by a wider audience that never saw it. Heinrich Himmler invited to screen it for SS-Einsatzgruppen troops headed for the Eastern Front to carry out the \\"Final Solution\\". Postwar legacy In 1946, Fritz Hippler was tried for directing Der ewige Jude but was not found guilty. Hippler contended Joseph Goebbels was the true creator of The Eternal Jew with Hitler's close supervision. He claimed that Goebbels gave Hippler credit as a reward \\"for his excellent work in the newsreel department\\".Winkel, Roel. Nazi German's Fritz Hippler, 1909‚Äì2002. Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television. Carfax Publishing. Vol 23, No 2, 2003. 91‚Äì99. Franz Hippler was interviewed in the Emmy Award-winning program \\"The Propaganda Battle\\" in the PBS series Walk Through the Twentieth Century (1983‚Äì1984). In this interview he stated that he regretted being listed as the director of The Eternal Jew because it resulted in being interrogated by the Allies after the war. He thought this was unfair because, in his opinion, he had nothing to do with the killing of Jews. In an interview shown in the ZDF documentary series Holocaust (2000), the 90-year-old Hippler described the film as \\"the most disgraceful example of antisemitism.\\" The film's narrator, Harry Giese, went on to narrate other films, but he was associated with this film and other films by the Third Reich and he found less work in the Postwar German cinema of the 1950s and 60s. Availability The public distribution and exhibition of the film is prohibited in Germany. The only exception is for use in college classrooms and other academic purposes; however, exhibitors must have formal education in \\"media science and the history of the Holocaust\\", and it can only be screened in a censored version with annotations.

History The organization was founded in 1989. Before 1998, it was known as the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia which was founded by Maria Kirbasova. It is a member of the human rights organization Human Rights House. Among the activities the organization is involved in is educating Russian civil society on the rule of law in relation to service in the military, as well as informing society about what the armed forces should look like in a democratic society. The organization also provides free legal advice to soldiers and their families about their rights and conscription laws, as well as intervening on behalf of soldiers who are facing abuse and hazing from their superiors and other more senior soldiers (dedovshchina). In August 2014 one of the members of the organisation stated that 100 wounded Russian soldiers who might have been injured fighting in Ukraine were taken to hospitals in Saint Petersburg. The Russian government labelled the organisation a \\"foreign agent\\", a move which members of the organization see as retaliation on the part of the authorities. According to The Moscow Times some considered this labeling of the group as punishment for their statements. The organization has not received any funding from foreign (non-Russian sources) since May 2014. On 18 October 2014, Russian police detained the head of local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Budennovsk, (73-year-old) Lyudmila Bogatenkova, on suspicion of fraud; the local Committee of Soldiers' Mothers in Saint Petersburg labelled this arrest \\"an act of intimidation in connection with her activities\\".

Biotin (spheres) fits snugly into a cavity of the RNA surface Aptamers (from the Latin aptus ‚Äì fit, and Greek meros ‚Äì part) are oligonucleotide or peptide molecules that bind to a specific target molecule. Aptamers are usually created by selecting them from a large random sequence pool, but natural aptamers also exist in riboswitches. Aptamers can be used for both basic research and clinical purposes as macromolecular drugs. Aptamers can be combined with ribozymes to self-cleave in the presence of their target molecule. These compound molecules have additional research, industrial and clinical applications. More specifically, aptamers can be classified as * DNA or RNA or XNA aptamers. They consist of (usually short) strands of oligonucleotides. * Peptide aptamers. They consist of one (or more) short variable peptide domains, attached at both ends to a protein scaffold. Types =Nucleic acid= Nucleic acid aptamers are nucleic acid species (next-gen antibody mimics) having selectivity at par of antibodies for a given target generated via in-vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) ranging from small entities such as heavy metal ions to large entities like cells. On the molecular level, aptamers bind to its cognate target through various non-covalent interactions viz., electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and induced fitting. Aptamers are useful in biotechnological and therapeutic applications as they offer molecular recognition properties that rival that of the commonly used biomolecule, antibodies. In addition to their discriminate recognition, aptamers offer advantages over antibodies as they can be engineered completely in a test tube, are readily produced by chemical synthesis, possess desirable storage properties, and elicit little or no immunogenicity in therapeutic applications. In 1990, two labs independently developed the technique of selection: the Gold lab, using the term SELEX for their process of selecting RNA ligands against T4 DNA polymerase; and the Szostak lab, coining the term in vitro selection, selecting RNA ligands against various organic dyes. The Szostak lab also coined the term aptamer (from the Latin, apto, meaning 'to fit') for these nucleic acid-based ligands. Two years later, the Szostak lab and Gilead Sciences, independent of one another, used in vitro selection schemes to evolve single stranded DNA ligands for organic dyes and human coagulant, thrombin (see anti-thrombin aptamers), respectively. There does not appear to be any systematic differences between RNA and DNA aptamers, save the greater intrinsic chemical stability of DNA. The notion of selection in vitro was preceded twenty-plus years prior when Sol Spiegelman used a Qbeta replication system as a way to evolve a self-replicating molecule. In addition, a year before the publishing of in vitro selection and SELEX, Gerald Joyce used a system that he termed 'directed evolution' to alter the cleavage activity of a ribozyme. Since the discovery of aptamers, many researchers have used aptamer selection as a means for application and discovery. In 2001, the process of in vitro selection was automated by J. Colin Cox in the Ellington lab at the University of Texas at Austin, reducing the duration of a selection experiment from six weeks to three days. While the process of artificial engineering of nucleic acid ligands is highly interesting to biology and biotechnology, the notion of aptamers in the natural world had yet to be uncovered until 2002 when two groups led by Ronald Breaker and Evgeny Nudler discovered a nucleic acid-based genetic regulatory element (which was named riboswitch) that possesses similar molecular recognition properties to the artificially made aptamers. In addition to the discovery of a new mode of genetic regulation, this adds further credence to the notion of an 'RNA World', a postulated stage in time in the origins of life on Earth. Both DNA and RNA aptamers show robust binding affinities for various targets. DNA and RNA aptamers have been selected for the same target. These targets include lysozyme, thrombin, human immunodeficiency virus trans-acting responsive element (HIV TAR), hemin, interferon Œ≥, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), prostate specific antigen (PSA), dopamine, and the non-classical oncogene, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). In the case of lysozyme, HIV TAR, VEGF and dopamine the DNA aptamer is the analog of the RNA aptamer, with thymine replacing uracil. The hemin, thrombin, and interferon Œ≥, DNA and RNA aptamers were selected through independent selections and have unique sequences. Considering that not all DNA analogs of RNA aptamers show functionality, the correlation between DNA and RNA sequence and their structure and function requires further investigation. Lately, a concept of smart aptamers, and smart ligands in general, has been introduced. It describes aptamers that are selected with pre-defined equilibrium , rate constants and thermodynamic (ŒîH, ŒîS) parameters of aptamer-target interaction. Kinetic capillary electrophoresis is the technology used for the selection of smart aptamers. It obtains aptamers in a few rounds of selection. Recent developments in aptamer- based therapeutics have been rewarded in the form of the first aptamer-based drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), called Macugen offered by OSI Pharmaceuticals. In addition, the company NeoVentures Biotechnology Inc. has successfully commercialized the first aptamer based diagnostic platform for analysis of mycotoxins in grain. Many contract companies develop aptamers and aptabodies to replace antibodies in research, diagnostic platforms, drug discovery, and therapeutics. Non-modified aptamers are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream, with a half-life of minutes to hours, mainly due to nuclease degradation and clearance from the body by the kidneys, a result of the aptamer's inherently low molecular weight. Unmodified aptamer applications currently focus on treating transient conditions such as blood clotting, or treating organs such as the eye where local delivery is possible. This rapid clearance can be an advantage in applications such as in vivo diagnostic imaging. An example is a tenascin-binding aptamer under development by Schering AG for cancer imaging. Several modifications, such as 2'-fluorine- substituted pyrimidines, polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkage, etc. (both of which are used in Macugen, an FDA-approved aptamer) are available to scientists with which to increase the serum half-life of aptamers easily to the day or even week time scale. Another approach to increase the nuclease resistance of aptamers is to develop Spiegelmers, which are composed entirely of an unnatural L-ribonucleic acid backbone. A Spiegelmer of the same sequence has the same binding properties of the corresponding RNA aptamer, except it binds to the mirror image of its target molecule. In addition to the development of aptamer-based therapeutics, many researchers such as the Ellington lab have been developing diagnostic techniques for aptamer based plasma protein profiling called aptamer plasma proteomics. This technology will enable future multi-biomarker protein measurements that can aid diagnostic distinction of disease versus healthy states. Furthermore, the Hirao lab applied a genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair to SELEX and achieved the generation of high affinity DNA aptamers. Only few hydrophobic unnatural base as a fifth base significantly augment the aptamer affinity to target proteins. As a resource for all in vitro selection and SELEX experiments, the Ellington lab has developed the Aptamer Database cataloging all published experiments. =Peptides= Peptide aptamers are artificial proteins selected or engineered to bind specific target molecules. These proteins consist of one or more peptide loops of variable sequence displayed by a protein scaffold. They are typically isolated from combinatorial libraries and often subsequently improved by directed mutation or rounds of variable region mutagenesis and selection. In vivo, peptide aptamers can bind cellular protein targets and exert biological effects, including interference with the normal protein interactions of their targeted molecules with other proteins. Libraries of peptide aptamers have been used as \\"mutagens\\", in studies in which an investigator introduces a library that expresses different peptide aptamers into a cell population, selects for a desired phenotype, and identifies those aptamers that cause the phenotype. The investigator then uses those aptamers as baits, for example in yeast two- hybrid screens to identify the cellular proteins targeted by those aptamers. Such experiments identify particular proteins bound by the aptamers, and protein interactions that the aptamers disrupt, to cause the phenotype. In addition, peptide aptamers derivatized with appropriate functional moieties can cause specific postranslational modification of their target proteins, or change the subcellular localization of the targets. Peptide aptamers can also recognize targets in vitro. They have found use in lieu of antibodies in biosensors and used to detect active isoforms of proteins from populations containing both inactive and active protein forms. Derivatives known as tadpoles, in which peptide aptamer \\"heads\\" are covalently linked to unique sequence double-stranded DNA \\"tails\\", allow quantification of scarce target molecules in mixtures by PCR (using, for example, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) of their DNA tails. The peptides that form the aptamer variable regions are synthesized as part of the same polypeptide chain as the scaffold and are constrained at their N and C termini by linkage to it. This double structural constraint decreases the diversity of the conformations that the variable regions can adopt, and this reduction in conformational diversity lowers the entropic cost of molecular binding when interaction with the target causes the variable regions to adopt a single conformation. As a consequence, peptide aptamers can bind their targets tightly, with binding affinities comparable to those shown by antibodies (nanomolar range). Peptide aptamer scaffolds are typically small, ordered, soluble proteins. The first scaffold, which is still widely used, is Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the trxA gene product (TrxA). In these molecules, a single peptide of variable sequence is displayed instead of the Gly-Pro motif in the TrxA -Cys-Gly-Pro- Cys- active site loop. Improvements to TrxA include substitution of serines for the flanking cysteines, which prevents possible formation of a disulfide bond at the base of the loop, introduction of a D26A substitution to reduce oligomerization, and optimization of codons for expression in human cells,. Reviews in 2015 have reported studies using 12 and 20 other scaffolds. Peptide aptamer selection can be made using different systems, but the most used is currently the yeast two-hybrid system. Peptide aptamers can also be selected from combinatorial peptide libraries constructed by phage display and other surface display technologies such as mRNA display, ribosome display, bacterial display and yeast display. These experimental procedures are also known as biopannings. Among peptides obtained from biopannings, mimotopes can be considered as a kind of peptide aptamers. All the peptides panned from combinatorial peptide libraries have been stored in a special database with the name MimoDB. Selection of Ligand Regulated Peptide Aptamers (LiRPAs) has been demonstrated. By displaying 7 amino acid peptides from a novel scaffold protein based on the trimeric FKBP-rapamycin-FRB structure, interaction between the randomized peptide and target molecule can be controlled by the small molecule Rapamycin or non-immunosuppressive analogs. Affimer The Affimer protein, an evolution of peptide aptamers, is a small, highly stable protein engineered to display peptide loops which provides a high affinity binding surface for a specific target protein. It is a protein of low molecular weight, 12‚Äì14 kDa, derived from the cysteine protease inhibitor family of cystatins. The Affimer scaffold is a stable protein based on the cystatin protein fold. It displays two peptide loops and an N-terminal sequence that can be randomised to bind different target proteins with high affinity and specificity similar to antibodies. Stabilisation of the peptide upon the protein scaffold constrains the possible conformations which the peptide may take, thus increasing the binding affinity and specificity compared to libraries of free peptides. The Affimer protein scaffold was developed initially at the MRC Cancer Cell Unit in Cambridge then across two laboratories at the University of Leeds. Affimer technology has been commercialised and developed by Avacta Life Sciences, who are developing it as reagents for research and therapeutic applications.  X-Aptamers  X-Aptamers are a new generation of aptamers designed to improve on the binding and versatility of regular DNA/RNA- based aptamers. X-Aptamers are engineered with a combination of natural and chemically-modified DNA or RNA nucleotides. Base modifications allow incorporation of various functional groups/small molecules into X-aptamers, opening a wide range of uses and a higher likelihood of binding success compared to standard aptamers. Thiophosphate backbone modifications at selected positions enhance nuclease stability and binding affinity without sacrificing specificity. X-Aptamers are able to explore new features by utilizing a new selection process. Unlike SELEX, X-Aptamer selection does not rely on multiple repeated rounds of PCR amplification but rather involves a two-step bead-based discovery process. In the primary selection process, combinatorial libraries are created where each bead will carry approximately 10^12 copies of a single sequence. The beads operate as carriers, where the bound sequences will ultimately be detached into solution. In the secondary solution pull-down process, each target will be used to individually pull down the binding sequences from solution. The binding sequences are amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. Sequences that are enriched for each target can then be synthesized and characterized. Development =AptaBiD= AptaBiD or Aptamer-Facilitated Biomarker Discovery is a technology for biomarker discovery. AptaBiD is based on multi- round generation of an aptamer or a pool of aptamers for differential molecular targets on the cells which facilitates exponential detection of biomarkers. It involves three major stages: (i) differential multi-round selection of aptamers for biomarker of target cells; (ii) aptamer-based isolation of biomarkers from target cells; and (iii) mass spectrometry identification of biomarkers. The important feature of the AptaBiD technology is that it produces synthetic affinity probes (aptamers) simultaneously with biomarker discovery. In AptaBiD, aptamers are developed for cell surface biomarkers in their native state and conformation. In addition to facilitating biomarker identification, such aptamers can be directly used for cell isolation, cell visualization, and tracking cells in vivo. They can also be used to modulate activities of cell receptors and deliver different agents (e.g., siRNA and drugs) into the cells. Applications Aptamers can be used in: * Affinity reagents * Bioimaging probes * SensingAgnivo Gosai, Brendan Shin Hau Yeah, Marit Nilsen-Hamilton, Pranav Shrotriya, Label free thrombin detection in presence of high concentration of albumin using an aptamer- functionalized nanoporous membrane, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Volume 126, 2019, Pages 88-95, ISSN 0956-5663, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.10.010. * Therapeutics, e.g. Pegaptanib. * Controlled release of therapeutics * Clinical & environmental diagnostics Aptamers have also been against several pathogens both bacterial & viruses including influenza A and B viruses, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in various experimental settings. =Antibody replacement= Aptamers have an innate ability to bind to any molecule they're targeted at, including cancer cells and bacteria. Bound to a target, aptamers inhibit its activity. Aptamers suffer from two issues that limit their effectiveness. Firstly, the bonds they form with target molecules are usually too weak to be effective, and second, they're easily digested by enzymes. Adding an unnatural base to a standard aptamer can increase its ability bind to target molecules. A second addition in the form of a \\"mini hairpin DNA\\" gives the aptamer a stable and compact structure that is resistant to digestion, extending its life from hours to days. Aptamers are less likely to provoke undesirable immune responses than antibodies. = Controlled Release of Therapeutics = The ability of aptamers to reversibly bind molecules such as proteins has generated increasing interest in using them to facilitate controlled release of therapeutic biomolecules, such as growth factors. This can be accomplished by tuning the affinity strength to passively release the growth factors, along with active release via mechanisms such as hybridization of the aptamer with complementary oligonucleotides or unfolding of the aptamer due to cellular traction forces. = PCR = Aptamers have been used to create hot start functions in PCR enzymes to prevent non-specific amplification during the setup and initial phases of PCR reactions.

Life Non-conformist, provocative and quick-witted, Henrietta Dugdale was a pioneering advocate for the rights of Australian women. She was born at St Pancras London on 14 May 1827, the second surviving daughter of John Worrell and Henrietta Ann (n√©e Austin). Her claim of a first marriage at 14 does not fit with her official marriage in 1848 to a merchant navy officer J. A. Davies, with whom she came to Australia in 1852. After Davies' death she married ship's captain William Dugdale in Melbourne in March 1853. They settled at Queenscliff where sons Einnim, Carl and Austin were born. Dugdale was a vegetarian.Pearce, Sharyn. (1992). The Shameless Scribbler: Louisa Lawson. Sir Robert Menzies Centre for Australian Studies. p. 4Magarey, Susan. (2001). Passions of the First Wave Feminists. UNSW Press. p. 26. After separating from William Dugdale in the late 1860s, she moved to the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell where she remained until a few years before her death on 17 June 1918 at Point Lonsdale. Her third husband Frederick Johnson, whom she married in 1903, predeceased her. Her campaign for 'equal justice for women' began with a letter to Melbourne's Argus newspaper in April 1869. Written under the pseudonym \\"ADA\\". It peaked during the 1880s in radical public debate as a member of Melbourne's Eclectic Society and the Australasian Secular Association, through her utopian allegory A Few Hours in a Far-Off Age and in the formation in May 1884 of the Victorian Women's Suffrage Society, the first of its kind in Australia. That same year, Henrietta wrote a scathing judgement of the Victorian courts, and their inability to protect women from violent crimes. Published in the Melbourne Herald, her words cut straight to the core of the issue: 'Women's anger,' she wrote, 'was compounded by the fact that those who inflicted violence upon women had a share in making the laws while their victims did not.' She was acknowledged as a suffrage pioneer when Australian women attained the vote and the associated right to stand for federal parliament in June 1902 (a world first) and when the State of Victoria belatedly followed suit in December 1908. Dugdale died on 17 June 1918 in Point Lonsdale, Australia. Legacy A street in the Canberra suburb of Cook is named for her. In 2013, she was nationally recognised as a critical first- wave Australian feminist, and The Dugdale Trust for Women & Girls, is named in honour of her life's work.

Gaines (November 1, 1933 ‚Äì July 20, 2016) was an American journalist and professor of journalism. Gaines was a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He retired from the paper in 2001 and taught in the Department of Journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign until his retirement and designation as an emeritus faculty member in 2007. He died July 20, 2016 at the age of 82.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-william-gaines-obituary- met-20160720-story.html Early life and career Gaines earned a bachelor's degree in broadcasting at Butler University in 1956. He served two years in the United States Army working for Armed Forces Radio in Germany. In 1963, he became a reporter for the Chicago Tribune, and then became an investigative reporter in 1974. From 1975 to 1999, Gaines taught an investigative reporting course each semester at Columbia College in Chicago. He was named to the Knight Chair in Journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2001, a post he held until he retired in 2007. Pulitzer Prize Gaines' first Pulitzer Prize came in 1976 as a member of an investigative team at the Tribune looking into unsafe medical practices at some Chicago hospitals. In 1988, Gaines and colleagues Dean Baquet and Ann Marie Lipinski won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for a series on the self-interest and waste that plagued the Chicago City Council. Gaines was nominated in 1979 for a series about the problems of the elderly. Gaines and David Jackson were nominated in 1996 for stories that probed questionable business dealings of the Nation of Islam. Watergate informant \\"uncovered\\" Gaines led a study with several of his students in 2003 to determine the identity of Watergate informant Deep Throat. Soon after the study, he set up a website, about the way in which he \\"uncovered\\" one of the great enduring mysteries of modern U.S. Politics. He came to the conclusion that Fred F. Fielding, a former senior partner at Wiley Rein LLP (then Wiley Rein & Fielding), a Washington, D.C. law firm, was Deep Throat. At the time of the Watergate scandal, Fielding was Associate Counsel for President Richard Nixon from 1970 to 1972, where he was the deputy to John Dean during the Watergate scandal. On May 31, 2005, the actual Deep Throat, W. Mark Felt, acknowledged his identity in an article in Vanity Fair, exonerating Fielding. On his website, Deep Throat Uncovered, Gaines has written about a confrontation with John Dean about the identity of Deep Throat: : He declined to respond to Smithsonian Magazine. John Dean has been steadfast in arguing Fielding would not have lied to him about being a source for the Post, and Dean bet Professor Gaines $100 that Gaines was wrong. Gaines took the bet.

It has been observed in bacteria, plants and fungi.Turr√†, D., El Ghalid, M., Rossi, F. and Di Pietro, A. (2015). Fungal pathogen uses sex pheromone receptor for chemotropic sensing of host plant signals. Nature 1‚Äì16. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15516 A chemical gradient can influence the growth of the organism in a positive or negative way. Positive growth is characterized by growing towards a stimulus and negative growth is growing away from the stimulus. Chemotropism is slightly different from Chemotaxis, the major difference being that chemotropism is related to growth, while chemotaxis is related to locomotion. Chemotropism in plants PSM V77 D352 The course of the pollen tube in a rock rose One prime example of chemotropism is seen in plant fertilization and pollen tube elongation of angiosperms, flowering plants. Unlike animals, plants cannot move, and therefore needs a delivery mechanism for sexual reproduction. Pollen, which contains the male gametophyte is transferred to another plant via insects or wind. If the pollen is compatible it will germinate and begin to grow. The ovary releases chemicals that stimulates a positive chemotropic response from the developing pollen tube. In response the tube develops a defined tip growth area that promotes directional growth and elongation of the pollen tube due to a calcium gradient. The steep calcium gradient is localized in the tip and promotes elongation and orientation of the growth. This calcium gradient is essential for the growth to occur; it has been shown that inhibiting the formation of the gradient results in no growth. As the pollen tube continues to grow towards the ovules, the male sperm remains in the apical region and is transported to the female ovule. The pollen tube elongates at a rate comparable to neurite development An example of positive and negative chemotropism is shown by a plant's roots; the roots grow towards useful minerals displaying positive chemotropism, and grow away from harmful acids displaying negative chemotropism. Chemotropism in animals In more complex organisms an example of chemotropic movement includes the growth of individual neuronal cell axons in response to extracellular signals. Secreted protein can either repel or attract specific neurons. Some signal proteins such as netrins, semaphorins, neurotrophins and fibroblast growth factors have been identified in aiding neuronal growth. These signals guide the developing axon to innervate the correct target tissue. The neuronal growth cones are guided by gradients of chemoattractant molecules released from their intermediate or final targets. There is evidence that the axons of peripheral neurons are guided by chemotropism and the directed growth of some central axons is also a chemotropic response, it remains to be determined whether chemotropism also operates in the central nervous system. Evidence has also been noted in neuronal regeneration, where chemotropic substances guide the ganglionic neurites towards the degenerated neuronal stump.  Chemotropism in Fungi Chemotropism seen in Yeast. Haploid Yeast cells release a- and Œ±-factors that bind to the receptors of another haploid Yeast cell. The two Yeast cells fuse together to form an a/Œ± diploid zygote. Fungal chemotropism was first reported over 100 years ago by Anton de Bary. One example of fungi using chemotropism is seen in Yeast.Yeast release chemical pheromones in order to attract mates. Each haploid yeast cells express specific haploid genes; haploid Œ±-cells express Œ±-genes and haploid a-cells express a-genes. Each cell type releases a unique pheromone: a- or Œ±-factor. By secreting these factors a chemical gradient is formed that attracts the other type of yeast cell during mating. In order for the yeast to sense the gradient they have to have proper receptors that bind a- or Œ±-factor: Ste3 and Ste2 respectively. The receptors to detect the pheromones are seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Once activated, there is a signaling cascade that results in the activation of transcription factors for mating-specific genes such as those involved in cell cycle arrest, directional polarization towards the chemical gradient, and sexual hyphae formation. When the cells get two Yeast cells are close enough their fungal hyphae merge to form a diploid zygote. Other examples of Chemotropism The addition of atmospheric nitrogen, also called nitrogen fixation, is an example of chemotropism.

They are popular in trail mix, salads, breads, with cereals, or eaten on their own. Dried cranberries are sometimes referred to as craisins due to the name's similarity to raisins, though the word \\"Craisin\\" is a registered trademark of Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. and cannot be officially applied to dried cranberries from other manufacturers. Most commercially produced dried cranberries contain added sugar, and they may also be coated in very small quantities of vegetable oil to keep them from sticking together. Many home recipes for dried cranberries involve allowing the cranberries to sit overnight in a water and sugar solution, prior to freeze-drying or air-drying. This can deprive the cranberries of some natural nutrients that would be contained in fresh cranberries. Benefits Dried cranberries contain the same nutrients as fresh cranberries (notably dietary fiber and antioxidants). However, commercial drying processes substantially reduce the vitamin A and vitamin C content. The nutrient density is also reduced if sugar is added. The nutrition facts for dried cranberries vary significantly depending on the brand. Nutrition facts for 1/3 cup (40 g) of Ocean Spray dried cranberries are as follows: *Calories: 123 kcal *Fat: 0.6 g *Sodium: 1 mg *Total Carbs: 24 g *Dietary Fiber: 2 g *Sugars: 22 g *Protein: 0 g Dried cranberries contain no cholesterol, or saturated or trans fats. Consuming dried cranberries will supply very little amounts of an individual's daily requirement for vitamins and minerals. The most substantial daily amount supplied is the mineral manganese, at 5% of the daily recommended intake. Having 1/4 cup of dried cranberries will supply one serving of fruits and vegetables, 25% of the daily recommendation from the USDA. The Canadian food guide recommends 7‚Äì10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily to reduce stroke, heart disease, and cancer risks. In the United States and Canada, Craisins are also considered to be a nut free product. Cranberries with minimal processing contain the highest amount of antioxidants, although dried cranberries retain some antioxidants. Some antioxidants include phenolic acids, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanin. It is the anthocyanin that provides pigment to supply cranberries with their robust red color. The added sugar can be a drawback for this product. Essentially, the sugar is added to improve texture and water content, and to reduce tartness.Wilson, T., Luebke, E.F., Carrell, M.C., Leveranz, L. K., Schmidt, T.P., Limburg, P.J., Vorsa, N. & Singh, A.P. Glycemic Responses to Sweetened Dried and Raw Cranberries in Humans with Type 2 Diabetes. \\"Journal of Food Science\\", vol. 75 (8), pp. H218-223. 2010. Dried cranberries made with less sugar may be helpful for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes. Because less sugar is added, there is a lower glycemic index and thus less of an insulin response occurs. However, this has not been the case in recent studies of participants with higher response times on glycemic intake/glucose output testing batteries. Uses Dried cranberries can be used as an addition in various foods including salads, oatmeal, cookies, muffins, loaves, breads and trail mix. They can act as a direct replacement for raisins or any dried fruit. Because dried cranberries are a dried fruit, spoilage is less of a concern than for fresh fruit. Dried cranberries can be a useful product to carry while traveling because of their extended shelf life. Dried cranberries are sometimes packaged with other flavorings. Dried cranberries can also come covered in chocolate.

Aside from his career, Brown ran unsuccessfully for office in both the Illinois state legislature and the U.S. Congress. Brown wrote many songs (125 have been published), 12 albums, and more than a dozen musical plays. Early life and education Brown was born in Chicago, Illinois to Oscar Brown Sr. and Helen (n√©e Clark). Brown's father was an attorney and real estate broker. Brown's first acting debut was on the radio show Secret City at the age of 15. For high school, Brown attended Englewood Technical Prep Academy (then known as Englewood High School). After high school, Brown attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and Lincoln University but later dropped out. He also served a stint in the U.S. Army. Career =Music= Brown's father intended for him to follow in his footsteps and become a practicing lawyer. While he did help his father at his practice, he ventured off into other careers such as advertising and served in the army in the mid-1950s. He also wrote songs. In the early 1950s, Mr. Brown was hired as a copy-writer by a small Chicago advertising company on Rush Street, Gershuny and Associates, owned by Sam Gershuny and Sheldon Sosna. At that time, Rush Street was totally segregated and Sam and Shelly took him to Adolf's, a high class Italian restaurant. As soon as they walked in, the owner sent the busboy over to say that the boss ‚Äúdid not want to serve Negroes in his restaurant.‚Äù So they just sat there and refused to leave until he finally decided to serve them. They did that in a number of restaurants up and down Rush Street in those days. A fraternity brother of Gershuny and Sosna owned a string of hotels and approached them about advertising his hotels by sponsoring two hours of the news in the morning on a black radio station. They decided to make Oscar Brown Jr. the disc jockey for the segment, starting at 5:30 until 7:30 in the morning. Unfortunately, they discovered Oscar was never making it at 5:30 as he was supposed to and they were lucky if he got there by 6:00. Also, Mr. Brown would make politically controversial comments about the on-going Korean War, As a result, Mr. Brown didn't last long as the DJ. When Mahalia Jackson recorded one of his songs, \\"Brown Baby\\", he began to focus on a career as a songwriter. His first major contribution to a recorded work was a collaboration with Max Roach, We Insist!, which was an early record celebrating the black freedom movement in the United States. Columbia Records signed Brown as a solo artist, who was by now in his mid-thirties and married with five children.Liner Notes for Sin & Soul, by Robert Barron Nemiroff. In 1960, Brown released his first LP, Sin & Soul, recorded from June 20 to October 23, 1960. Printed on the cover of the album were personal reviews by well-known celebrities and jazz musicians of the time, including Steve Allen, Lorraine Hansberry, Nat Hentoff, Dorothy Killgallen, Max Roach and Nina Simone (Simone would later cover his \\"Work Song\\" and Steve Allen would later hire him for his Jazz Scene USA television program). The album is regarded as a \\"true classic\\" for openly tackling the experiences of African Americans with songs such as \\"Bid 'Em In\\" and \\"Afro Blue\\". Sin & Soul is also significant because Brown took several popular jazz instrumentals and combined them with self- penned lyrics on songs such as \\"Dat Dere\\", \\"Afro Blue\\" and \\"Work Song\\". This began a trend that would continue with several other major jazz vocalists. Several of the tracks from Sin & Soul were embraced by the 1960s Mod movement, such as \\"Humdrum Blues\\",The track is included in the Ace Records series The Return Of Mod Jazz (Mod Jazz Series), and is described as a \\"mod anthem\\". \\"Work Song\\" and \\"Watermelon Man\\". Sin & Soul was followed by Between Heaven and Hell (1962). The success of Sin & Soul meant that much more money was spent on production and Quincy Jones and Ralph Burns were bought in to handle the arrangements. However, Brown was soon to fall down the pecking order at Columbia following a rearrangement of the management at the company. His third album was notable for the lack of any self-composed songs, and Columbia was having a hard time packaging him as an artist. They were unsure whether Brown was suited to middle-of-the-road/easy listening nightclubs or alternatively should be presented as a jazz artist. Brown was given much more creative freedom for his fourth album, Tells It Like It Is (1963), and he was back to his creative best, composing songs such as \\"The Snake\\", which became a Northern Soul classic when it was covered by Al Wilson, and has featured on several adverts. Despite this return to form, and having been told by the new head of Columbia, that he was high on the company's priorities, his contract at Columbia was not renewed. =Stage and television= He attempted to mount a major musical stage show in New York City called Kicks & Co. in 1961. Host Dave Garroway turned over an entire broadcast of the Today show to Brown to perform numbers from the show and try to raise the necessary funds to launch it on the stage. Kicks & Co. is set on an all-African-American college campus in the American South during the early days of attempted desegregation. The character Mr. Kicks is an emissary of Satan, sent to try to derail these efforts in which the play's protagonist, Ernest Black, has become involved. This was the first of several theatrical endeavors by Brown, and like all of them, the public was not won over sufficiently to allow financial success, despite acclaim by some critics. His longest-running relative success, thanks to the participation of Muhammad Ali, was Buck White. Another notable musical show, Joy, saw two incarnations (in 1966 and 1969) and again addressed social issues. Appearing with Brown were his wife, Jean Pace, and the Brazilian singer/accordionist Sivuca. RCA released the original cast recording around 1970; it is long out of print. In 1962, he worked on the Westinghouse syndicated television program Jazz Scene USA, produced by Steve Allen. Brown was the show's presenter and it featured a new musical guest each week. Personal life Brown was married to Jean Pace, the older sister of actress Judy Pace. He was the father of seven children. His son, Oscar \\"BoBo\\" Brown III was a bassist and musical arranger who died in a car crash in August 1996. His daughter Maggie is a singer. A Chicago musical review referred to the trio as \\"The First Family of Swing.\\" They were joined by the youngest daughter, Africa Pace Brown, in an effort to popularize his music. Brown's first son, Napoleon \\"David\\" Brown, inspired the song \\"Brown Baby\\" and helped his father promotional appearances and business. The remaining family members consist of Donna Brown Kane, Joan Olivia Brown, and Iantha Brown Casen, who participated in some of her father's production. On May 29, 2005, Oscar Brown died in his hometown of Chicago from osteomyelitis at the age of 78. Humanitarian work Brown founded the Oscar Brown Jr. H.I.P. Legacy Foundation to continue his humanitarian work. He participated in an anti-apartheid protest rally in Compton College in 1976.Ed Hamilton, \\"Brown, Brando and Mandela\\" , JazzTimes, December 16, 2013. Brown wrote the vocalese lyrics to the Duke Pearson melody \\"Jeannine\\" as sung by Eddie Jefferson on the album The Main Main recorded in October 1974 and covered by The Manhattan Transfer on their 1984 album Bop Doo-Wopp. \\"Somebody Buy Me a Drink\\", a track from Sin & Soul, was covered by David Johansen and the Harry Smiths on their eponymous first album. \\"Hymn to Friday\\" from Between Heaven and Hell is played on jazz radio stations such as WDCB. Pianist Wynton Kelly recorded \\"Strongman\\" with his trio in the late 1950s. Nina Simone popularized Brown's lyrics to \\"Work Song\\", \\"Afro Blue\\", and \\"Bid 'Em In.\\"\\"Oscar Brown Jr. recognized as one of Chicago‚Äôs top artistic creators\\" , Chicago Defender, June 30, 2010. Brown's lyrics to \\"Afro Blue\\" have been performed by Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Lizz Wright. Vocalist Karrin Allyson cited Brown as an inspiration and has performed his compositions on several of her albums. Brown was scheduled to contribute lyrics to Allyson's 2006 album Footprints before his death; instead she recorded his songs \\"A Tree and Me\\" and \\"But I Was Cool\\" as a tribute. Brown was the subject of a tribute album by cabaret singer Linda Kosut.Jerry D'Souza, \\"Linda Kosut: Long As You're Living (2007)\\", All About Jazz, September 7, 2007.

He was the younger brother of Divitiacus, the Aedui druid and statesman. The Aedui were allies of Rome, but Dumnorix was a leader of the tribe‚Äôs anti-Roman faction, who ‚Äú...thought it better to be dominated by their fellow Gauls... rather than the Romans.‚ÄùGoldsworthy, Caesar, 206  Chieftain of the Aedui  In the years preceding Julius Caesar‚Äôs governorship of Transalpine Gaul the Helvetii tribe planned an invasion of western Gaul. Orgetorix, a prominent Helvetii chieftain, conspired with Dumnorix, and Casticus of the Sequani to make themselves kings in their own tribes. Then by their combined power rule all of Gaul in a Gallic version of the triumvirate. To strengthen the alliance Orgetorix married his daughter to Dumnorix. However, the conspiracy was discovered and Orgetorix died a short time after amid rumours of suicide.Goldsworthy, Caesar, 207 Dumnorix used his influence to persuade the Sequani to allow the Helvetii to migrate through their territory. Upon arriving in Gaul in 58 BC Caesar opposed the migration militarily. He built fortifications at Lake Geneva and either requested or demanded that the Aedui, who had been named friend and ally of Rome, supply his soldiers with grain. Dumnorix was very popular and had a large contingent of person retainers. He used his influence to delay the grain supply. Caesar forced the Helvetii to take an alternate path, then inflicted a devastating defeat on the tribe at the Battle of the Arar. Caesar pursued the Helvetii, using the Gallic cavalry to screen his advance. Dumnorix‚Äô personal retainers made up a sizeable contingent of the Gallic auxiliary. Dumnorix colluded with the Helvetii and at a key moment in an engagement withdrew his unit, giving the Helvetii the victory.Goldsworthy, Caesar, 215 With his grain supply desperate, Caesar summoned the leaders of his Gallic allies. Liscus, the chief magistrate or Vergobretus of the Aedui, revealed to Caesar that Dumnorix was responsible for withholding the supplies and had also been in command of the unit whose flight had cost him the cavalry engagement. Dumnorix was spared any serious retribution at the intervention of his brother Diviciacus, who had good relations with Caesar and the Romans. Caesar agreed instead to place Dumnorix under surveillance. Dumnorix continued to be troublesome, and in 54 BC was one of the Gaulish leaders Caesar proposed to take with him as hostages on his second expedition to Britain, fearing that they might cause trouble in his absence. Dumnorix pleaded his fear of the sea and religious obligations in an attempt to get Caesar to leave him behind. When this failed, he claimed that Caesar intended to have them all killed out of sight of their people. Finally, he attempted to escape from Caesar's camp along with the Aeduan cavalry. Caesar sent the rest of the cavalry after him, and Dumnorix was killed, shouting that he was \\"a free man and a citizen of a free state\\". The rest of the Aeduan cavalry returned to Caesar's service.  Etymology  His name, like other Gaulish language names (Ambiorix, Orgetorix, Vercingetorix) contains a -rix suffix which is etymologically related to the Latin rex, Gaelic r√≠, Sanskrit rƒÅja- and German Reich, indicating kingship or rule; it is probably an aristocratic suffix. Dumno- is etymologically related to the Gaelic domhan \\"world\\", indicating that the name may be translated as \\"king of the world\\".

Overview \\"47 South Tangra Road\\", may be the most confusing postal address, as it used to cover the whole of Chinatown Tangra with over 350 tanneries. Most of the standing structures have been built, over many years, by the industrious Hakka Chinese, upon marshy and reclaimed low-lying land. Over the past several decades, it has served as the location of Calcutta's Chinatown. This is not a coincidence; the Hakka Chinese of Calcutta have gradually turned this part of the Kolkata into an important destination for sourcing finished and semi-finished leather. The Hakka Chinese specialized in the manufacture of leather and turned it into one of the major industries of West Bengal, providing employment to tens of thousands of local inhabitants. In addition to the huge volume of exports to the developing and developed countries, finished leather is supplied to the major shoe and leather goods manufacturers all over the country. Many made-to-order shoe shops in Kolkata are also run by entrepreneurs from this community. Amidst the Chinese establishments and restaurants, there is a very old and auspicious 'Kali Mondir'. The temple is situated near Kim Fa restaurant and Relax Foreign Liquor Shop. This temple is visited by both Chinese and Hindu devotees. One needs to be there to experience the spectacle of two cultures harmoniously doing business generation after generation. Food from Tangra is a distinct variety of traditional Hakka Chinese cuisine adapted to Indian ingredients and the Bengali palate. This has spread to the rest of India, along with the recipes earlier unique to Tangra. Tangra is now the most popular destination for Chinese food. Chinese food sold in Tangra restaurants are now known all over the world as \\"Hakka Style\\" Chinese food. Kolkata Chinatown is changing rapidly. The population is no longer renewed by waves of migration and many traditional professions such as dentistry, laundry and tannery are no longer the preserve of the Chinese. The West Bengal government, under direction from the Supreme Court, recently moved all tanneries to Bantala, a suburb in the east of Kolkata. However, Tangra has been an integral part of the culture of the Chinese community in India. The success of \\"Hakka style\\" Chinese food in the rest of India encouraged a migration of many Chinese families to other cities as the economic fortunes of Tangra decayed. Many landmark Chinese eateries, including Nanking, Waldorf, Peiping and Fat Mama have closed or changed hands and fortunes. The once prosperous Calcutta Chinese community is now clearly in decline. However, a boom in Tangra's unique Indian-Chinese food is attracting a lot of attention these days and the cuisine will probably live on in Kolkata and in the global Indian Diaspora. The Cha Project, is designed to preserve Tiretti Bazaar and develop Tangra. History The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Tangra was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt. Ltd.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, pp. 14-15, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition. In the eastern fringes of Kolkata, the neighbourhoods such as Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa, were populated largely with people who migrated from poverty-ridden and caste-ridden villages, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They came with dreams of a better life but landed in the slums with open drains, pigsties, factory chimneys and pungent chemicals. They found work in the tanneries and factories, and also engaged in menial work. A big proportion of them were Chamars, but there also were Doms, Dosads, Mehtars and Kahars. They were all Harijans and they formed a majority. They escaped from the petty persecution they faced in their villages but were far removed from the mainstream of urban life and culture. They have been here, living in depressing conditions, for more than a century.Bandyopadhyay, Raghab, \\"The Inheritors: Slum and Pavement Life in Calcutta\\", in Calcutta, The Living City Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 78-82, First published 1990, 2005 edition, Oxford University Press, Geography =Police district= Tangra police station is in the Eastern Suburban division of Kolkata Police.

Overview The movie is a comedy starring Cindy Williams, Stephen Nathan and Bruce Kimmel. Nathan plays Harry Schechter, heir to a Hollywood studio forced to make a musical comedy porno in order to stave off bankruptcy. The movie features a series of farcical lewd musical numbers in the style of classical Hollywood musical comedies including: \\"Orgasm\\", \\"Lesbian Butch Dyke\\", and \\"Dancing Dildos.\\" The movie has a low- budget feel, with a \\"musical-within-a-movie\\" theme in the tradition of Singin' in the Rain, but with satirical sexual humor. An early staple of Cinemax, it has become a cult film since its initial release and was released on DVD in 2001 and is currently available on Blu-ray on Kritzerland. The film is featured in Cult Movies II by Danny Peary, and has a long entry in the book about 1970s film musicals, We Can Be Who We Are by Lee Gambin. It was one of several farcical musical-comedy collaborations between Kimmel (who also co- starred in the movie) and Williams, along with The Creature Wasn't Nice in 1981. Originally distributed by Paramount Pictures in 1976, it was picked up by World-Northal in 1977 and re-released to great acclaim, first in New York, where it played for three months exclusively at the 68th Street Playhouse before gaining wider distribution. The first week of its wide release, it was the fourth highest-grossing picture in the country, behind Star Wars, You Light Up My Life, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Reception The film received polarizing reviews. Judith Crist raved about the film in the New York Post, saying, \\"Chockful of youthful talent, well spiced by outrageousness and sparked by invention. The three stars are simply irresistible. Cindy Williams is enchanting, Kimmel is the ultimate appealing schnook. Fresh and funny and funky. Made for about 1 percent of the budget of New York, New York, but a hundred times funnier and more perceptive.\\" Joseph Gelmis of Newsday also raved, \\"More vitality, imagination, zany comedy and stellar performances than most movies. It's one of the most memorable movies of this year. A raunchy delight. Cindy Williams is a marvel! Kimmel is a joy to watch!\\" The film also received rave reviews from Kathleen Carroll of the New York Daily News, who wrote, \\"Bright, bawdy, gleefully naughty! Bruce Kimmel is endearingly funny,\\" as well as Bruce Williamson of Playboy (\\"A Mel Brooksian salute to porno chic\\") and Howard Kissell of Women's Wear Daily (\\"Funny, naughty, surprisingly charming. Ingenuous, bright performances\\". But it was panned by Janet Maslin of The New York Times, who described the concept of the film as \\"a losing proposition\\" and found the music \\"tuneless.\\" Arthur D.

Merrick Boulevard, which bisects the community in a generally east‚Äìwest direction, forms its commercial spine. It is bounded by Springfield Boulevard to the west, 121st Avenue to the north, Laurelton Parkway to the east, and Conduit Avenue to the south. Laurelton is located in Queens Community District 13 and its ZIP Codes are 11413 and 11422. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 105th Precinct. Description Laurelton derives its name from the Laurelton station on the Long Island Rail Road, which was named for the laurels that grew there over 100 years ago. It was modeled after an English village, with stately Tudor-style homes, both attached and detached. A few co-ops exist in a former garden apartment complex, there has been some new construction but no high-rise buildings, which has enabled Laurelton to keep its small town feel. The area of Laurelton closest to Rosedale and Cambria Heights consists primarily of single-family homes whereas the area abutting Springfield Gardens contains more multi family homes. The area south of Merrick Boulevard contains many large, individually designed houses, while certain blocks to the north, running eastward from Francis Lewis Boulevard, have attached, Tudor-style rowhouses. Laurelton also has a series of streets with planted center malls. Demographics In the 1930s through 1970s, Laurelton was home to many Jewish-American families but succeeding generations have included various Afrodescended groups, including African-Americans, Caribbean/West Indians and West Africans, many of whom were attracted to Laurelton's more suburban-like environment.

His most well known works are Sgt. Frog, a manga he created which later received an anime adaption, and Kemono Friends, a multimedia franchise for which Yoshizaki serves as concept designer. Career Yoshizaki was born in Isahaya, Nagasaki. As a graduate student of Nagasaki University, he started from drawing his own d≈çjinshi, based on video games that were famous at that time (somewhere in the 1980s). With that d≈çjinshi, he practiced and improved his drawing skills day by day. Yoshizaki said that his experience in drawing d≈çjinshi was the most priceless experience that he ever had. According to him, making d≈çjinshi gave him the opportunity to seek through the world of the manga industry, with all aspects from drawing to producing (meeting with printers, editing process etc.). This allows him to do all the work, rather working in a big-scale production company that lets him work in one particular branch. Yoshizaki later worked as an assistant to manga artist Katsu Aki. His first publication was featured in a compilation book published by Shogakukan in 1989. He is best known for his manga Keroro Gunso, published as Sgt. Frog in the United States, which was first published in the Japanese manga magazine Sh≈çnen Ace.Wong, Amos. \\"Creator Profile: Mine Yoshizaki\\". (February 2007) Newtype USA. pp. 52-55. He is also the creator of Arcade Gamer Fubuki and did character design on the series Seven of Seven. In 2005, Sgt. Frog received the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga. Due to various Gundam references, an ongoing Sgt. Frog anime was produced by Bandai. This led to Yoshizaki collaborating on certain Gundam projects, such as designing the mascot girls Reiko Holinger and Catharine Blitzen for the Gundam Card Builder game. He has also been the designer of the Angel-XX figurine series from Neon Genesis Evangelion. He provided character designs for the 1999 PlayStation video game Pop'n Tanks. He later was a character designer for the Konami Gradius-type shooter Otomedius. This is significant because, instead of simply moving a fighter craft around, the player controls a unique character bound within a vehicle. He has also designed a playable character called Angol Fear (a nod to his character Angol Mois in Sgt. Frog ‚Äì they even wield similar weapons) to the fighting game Soulcalibur IV. He also is credited as concept designer for the Kemono Friends franchise, including the anime series.  Works  * 1993‚Äì1995: FANTASWEAT * 1993‚Äì1995: Detana!!

The line runs west through a series of South West London suburbs to Reading, in central Berkshire. Its passenger operation is by South Western Railway (SWR), which also manage its stations. The Waterloo‚ÄìReading line is the core of a group of lines and branches heading generally westwards from Waterloo, providing predominantly passenger services into London. All of the branches and connecting lines have direct services into a dedicated group of platforms at Waterloo, so most of the services using the line do not run the whole length of the line. After leaving Waterloo, the line runs parallel to the South West Main Line before diverging at Clapham Junction and heading westwards. Within Greater London, the Hounslow Loop Line diverges at Barnes and reconnects again near Feltham, whilst the Kingston Loop Line diverges at Twickenham to join up with the South West Main Line at New Malden. At Staines, the original route carries onto Windsor, whilst the 1853 route to Reading diverges to run via Egham. At Virginia Water, the Chertsey Branch Line provides another connection to the South West Main Line whilst at Ascot, the Ascot‚ÄìGuildford line heads southwards towards Aldershot and Farnham. At Wokingham, the line is synonymous with the west end of the North Downs Line leading into Reading, to terminate in platforms 4, 5 and 6. The line also sees some freight services and special charters, which use the connecting line at Reading to join the Great Western Main Line or the Chertsey Loop/Branch Line to connect to the South West Main Line. Due to the large swathes of suburbs served along the line and the drop from four to two tracks west of Barnes, services between Reading and London Waterloo are relatively slow compared to the two fast tracks between Reading and London Paddington. The line is predominantly used for commuter traffic into London with most of the traffic being generated by intermediate stations. To ease over-crowding, a roll-out is underway of 8-car trains being extended to 10 coaches and there have been calls to change the service patterns to provide some additional and faster services, cutting out some of the intermediate stops. History The London and Southampton Railway opened the first stretch of railway between Nine Elms and Woking Common on 12 May 1838, and renamed itself as the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) one month later. As the L&SWR; continued extending its railway towards Southampton, the first branch was opened by the Richmond and West End Railway (R&WER;) to Richmond on 27 July 1846.Mitchell, Vic and Smith, Keith (1988) Waterloo to Windsor, 1st ed, Middleton Press, Midhurst This branch line started at what is now Clapham Junction, although the station itself did not open until 2 March 1863. The terminus at Nine Elms was replaced on 11 July 1848 with a new station at Waterloo, originally named Waterloo Bridge. The Richmond branch was extended further west by the Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway (WS&SWR;) opening as far as Datchet on 22 August 1848 and to Windsor on 1 December 1849. Both the R&WER; and WS&SWR; were purchased by the L&SWR; before their respective lines had been completed. The South Eastern Railway (SER) opened its line from Wokingham to Reading on 15 October 1849 under the auspices of the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway (RG&RR;), which was then taken over by the SER in 1852.Mitchell, Vic, and Smith, Keith (1989) Branch lines around Ascot, 1st ed, Middleton Press, Midhurst This was part of the SER line from London to Reading via Guidlford and terminated at Reading Southern railway station, which was adjacent to, but separate from the Great Western Railway station at Reading. The line linking Staines with Wokingham was authorised in 1853 and built by the Staines, Wokingham and Woking Junction Railway, opening from Staines to Ascot on 4 June 1856 and onwards to Wokingham on 9 July 1856. Initial services on the line were 6 trains a day between Waterloo and Reading (2 on Sundays), building up to 14 trains a day (7 on Sunday) by 1928. The line was operated by the L&SWR; from the outset, who leased it from the owning company in 1858 for 50% of the gross profits, before purchasing it outright in 1878.Maggs, Colin C. (1993) Branch Lines of Berkshire, 1st ed, Alan Sutton Publishing, Stroud There were now three competing routes to Reading: the GWR from Paddington at 36 miles; the LSWR from Waterloo at 43.5 miles and the SER from Charing Cross at 69 miles. Despite the disparity, the GWR was not the obvious choice due to the relative position of Paddington station, west of the City of London. This allowed intense competition between the three companies until in 1858 a new agreement between the three companies was made to fix prices and share fares. The agreement led to a connecting spur between the SER and GWR railways in Reading being opened for goods traffic on 1 December 1858 and to passenger traffic on 17 January 1859. A better-placed link was opened on 17 December 1899, and the third link on 1 June 1941. The link is today used by special services such as luxury steam services. =Electrification= Southern Region trains in 1979. The line was electrified on the DC third rail system, initially at 660 volts, in sections: * Waterloo to Twickenham flyover (for Kingston Loop) 30 January 1916 * Twickenham to Whitton Junction (for Hounslow Loop) 12 March 1916 * Whitton Junction to Windsor 6 July 1930Marshall, C.F.D (1963) History of the Southern Railway, 2nd ed, Ian Allan, London p.413 * Staines to Virginia Water 3 January 1937 as part of the electrification of lines to Portsmouth * Virginia Water to Ascot and Reading South 1 January 1939. =Accidents and incidents= Early on Sunday 15 November 2009 the bridge carrying the line over the River Crane, London, partly collapsed leading to service suspension. Services were restored eight days later on a temporary diversionary line with a per hour speed limit laid across the site of the disused Feltham Marshalling yard. The defective bridge was demolished and rebuilt. Passenger services and rolling stock In the current timetable, there are two trains per hour between Waterloo and Reading, every day of the week; the Reading service only calls at major stations Clapham Junction, Richmond, Twickenham, Feltham (with a short bus link to Heathrow Airport), Staines and then all stations to Reading. During peak hours, additional trains are run which skip Winnersh, Winnersh Triangle and Earley, and add stops at Vauxhall and Ashford (Surrey). Connecting lines add additional services on this line - * Services on the Weybridge branch line (Chertsey Loop) run in part between Virginia Water and London on the line, namely before and after using the Hounslow loop * Services on the Staines‚ÄìWindsor line between Staines and London * Services on the Kingston Loop Line between Twickenham and London * Services on the Hounslow Loop Line between Twickenham and London * Services on the North Downs Line run between Reading and Wokingham do not stop at the intervening stations * During peak hours, four trains in the morning on the Shepperton Branch Line and three evening trains to that line run between Twickenham and London * During peak hours, some trains commencing at Farnham and then on the Ascot to Guildford line are extended to London, providing more services between Ascot and Waterloo. Services are mainly formed of Class 458/5s, but a few 450s also work the line. Future Due to high demand and overcrowding for a considerable part of many services enhancements are underway. The stations between Waterloo and Staines, unless prohibited by bridges, are having platforms lengthened for 10-coach trains, which use converted Class 458 units. Platform 20 at the former Waterloo International Terminal re-entered service in October 2013. Additional trains were purchased in the early 2010s. On 20 November 2014, Network Rail published a plan, the Wessex Route Study, for wide consultation; its recommendations are to abolish the running of trains shorter than 10 coaches to Reading except in very low usage hours and to open more of the platforms at the former London Waterloo International with a suggested target date of 2019. In March 2014, the Thames Valley Local Enterprise Partnership published a report showing the economic benefits of improvements to the Waterloo to Reading line. This looked at the economic benefits of increasing services, speeding up services (timetabling more semi-fast and fast services to improve access to major stops from London and from Reading) and adding access to Heathrow Airport, and concluded that the benefits exceeded the costs of such improvements.

Periods of extended isolation may predispose people to this condition. In particular, the syndrome has been identified as a potential concern for individuals living in outer space for extended periods of time.  Overview  Individuals experiencing solipsism syndrome feel that reality is not 'real' in the sense of being external to their own minds. The syndrome is characterized by feelings of loneliness, detachment and indifference to the outside world. Solipsism syndrome is not currently recognized as a psychiatric disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, though it shares similarities with depersonalization disorder, which is recognized. Solipsism syndrome is distinct from solipsism, which is not a psychological state but rather a philosophical position, namely that nothing exists or can be known to exist outside of one's own mind; advocates of this philosophy do not necessarily suffer from solipsism syndrome, and sufferers do not necessarily subscribe to solipsism as a school of intellectual thought. Periods of extended isolation may predispose people to solipsism syndrome. In particular, the syndrome has been identified as a potential challenge for astronauts and cosmonauts on long-term missions, and these concerns influence the design of artificial habitats.

They include the capriole, the courbette, the mezair, the croupade and the levade. None are typically seen in modern competitive dressage. They are performed by horses of various riding academies such as the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and the Cadre Noir in Saumur, and may be seen in other dressage performances. The levade and courbette are a particular feature of the Doma Menorquina, the riding tradition of the island of Menorca. Horses such as the Andalusian, Lusitano, Lipizzan and Menorqu√≠n are the breeds most often trained to perform the airs today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements. There were originally seven airs, many of which were used to build into the movements performed today. There is a popular conception that these movements were originally taught to horses for military purposes, and indeed both the Spanish Riding School and the Cadre Noir are military foundations. However, while agility was necessary on the battlefield, most of the airs as performed today would have exposed the vulnerable underbelly of the horse to the weapons of foot soldiers. It is therefore more likely that the airs were exercises to develop the military horse and rider, rather than to be employed in combat. Horses are usually taught each air on the long rein without a rider, which is less strenuous for the animal. However, each movement is meant to eventually be performed under a rider.  The pesade and the levade  The pesade and levade are the first airs taught to the High School horse, and it is from these that all other airs are taught. In the pesade, the horse raises its forehand off the ground and tucks the forelegs evenly, carrying all weight on the hindquarters, to form a 45 degree angle with the ground. The levade was first taught at the beginning of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30‚Äì35 degrees from the ground. Unlike the pesade, which is more of a test of balance, the decreased angle makes the levade an extremely strenuous position to hold, and requires a greater effort from the horse. Therefore, many horses are not capable of a good-quality levade. The levade is also a transition movement between work on the ground and the airs above the ground. Neither of these movements are equivalent to rearing, as they require precise control, excellent balance, and a great deal of strength, and are the product of correct training, rather than resistance from the horse. The horse is asked to enter the pesade or levade from the piaffe, which asks the horse to increasingly engage its hindquarters, lowering them toward the ground and bringing the hind legs more toward its center of gravity. This gives the viewer the impression that the horse appears to sink down in back and rise in front. The position is held for a number of seconds, and then the horse quietly puts the forelegs back on the ground and proceeds at the walk, or stands at the halt. The levade is considered to be pinnacle of collection, as the horse carries all weight on the back legs, and has an extreme tucking of the hindquarters and coiling of the loins.  The capriole, the croupade and the ballotade  In the capriole (meaning leap of a goat), the horse jumps from a raised position of the forehand straight up into the air, kicks out with the hind legs, and lands more or less on all four legs at the same time. It requires an enormously powerful horse to perform correctly, and is considered the most difficult of all the airs above the ground. It is first introduced with the croupade, in which the horse does not kick out at the height of elevation, but keeps the hind legs tucked tightly under, and remains parallel to the ground. The horse is then taught the ballotade. In this movement, the horse's hind hooves are positioned so one can see its shoes if watching from behind, but the horse is not asked to kick out. When the horse demonstrates proficiency in the ballotade, the capriole is introduced.  The courbette  In the courbette, the horse raises its forehand off the ground, tucks up forelegs evenly, and then jumps forward, never allowing the forelegs to touch down, in a series of \\"hops\\". Extremely strong and talented horses can perform five or more leaps forward before having to touch down with the forelegs, although it is more usual to see a series of three or four leaps. The courbette, like the capriole, is first introduced through the easier croupade.  The mezair  Mezair In the mezair, the horse rears up and strikes out with its forelegs. It is similar to a series of levades with a forward motion (not in place), with the horse gradually bringing its legs further under himself in each successive movement and lightly touching the ground with the front legs before pushing up again. The mezair was originally called the courbette by the old dressage masters. It is no longer practiced at the Spanish Riding School.

This is opposed to government regulations such as minimum-wage laws, competition laws, economic sanctions, restrictions on price fixing, or restrictions on contracting with undocumented workers. The freedom to contract is the underpinning of laissez-faire economics and is a cornerstone of free-market libertarianism. The proponents of the concept believe that through \\"freedom of contract\\", individuals possess a general freedom to choose with whom to contract, whether to contract or not, and on which terms to contract. History Henry James Sumner Maine proposed that social structures evolve from roles derived from social status to those based on contractual freedom. A status system establishes obligations and relationships by birth, but a contract presumes that the individuals are free and equal. Modern libertarianism, such as that advanced by Robert Nozick, sees freedom of contract as the expression of the independent decisions of separate individuals pursuing their own interests under a \\"minimal state.\\" United States =Lochner v. New York= In 1902 a New York baker named Joseph Lochner was fined for violating a state law limiting the number of hours his employees could work. He sued the state on the grounds that he was denied his right to \\"due process.\\" Lochner claimed that he had the right to freely contract with his employees and that the state had unfairly interfered with this. In 1905, the Supreme Court used the due process clause to declare unconstitutional the New York state statute imposing a limit on hours of work. Rufus Wheeler Peckham wrote for the majority: \\"Under that provision no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment.\\" Writing in dissent, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. accused the majority of basing its decision on laissez-faire ideology. He believed that it was making law based on economics rather than interpreting the constitution. He believed that \\"Liberty of Contract\\" did not exist and that it was not intended in the Constitution. =Afterward= In his \\"Liberty of Contract\\" (1909), Roscoe Pound critiqued freedom-of-contract laws by laying out case after case in which labor rights were struck down by state and federal Supreme Courts. Pound argued the courts' rulings were \\"simply wrong\\" from the standpoint of common law and \\"even from that of a sane individualism\\" (482). Pound further compared the situation of labor legislation in his time to common opinion of usury and that the two were \\"of the same type\\" (484). Pound lamented that the legacy of such \\"academic\\" and \\"artificial\\" judicial rulings for liberty of contract engendered a \\"lost respect for the courts\\" but predicted a \\"bright\\" future for labor legislation (486-487).Roscoe Pound, \\"Liberty of Contract,\\" 18 Yale Law Journal 454 (1909). The Supreme Court applied the liberty of contract doctrine sporadically over the next three decades but generally upheld reformist legislation as being within the states' police power. In 1937 the Court reversed its view in the case West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish. In that case the court upheld a Washington state law setting a minimum wage. United Kingdom In the late 19th century, the English judiciary espoused \\"freedom of contract\\" as a generally applicable feature of public policy, best expressed in Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465, regarding freedom of contract and patents by Sir George Jessel MR. In the later 20th century, the view of the common law had changed completely. In George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd, Lord Denning MR compared \\"freedom of contract\\" with oppression of the weak, as he outlined the development the law had undergone.  Law and economics  In economics, the freedom of contract has been studied in the field of contract theory. According to the Coase Theorem, the freedom of contract is beneficial in the absence of transaction costs. When two rational parties voluntarily enter into a contract, they must be (at least weakly) better off than in the absence of the contract. The parties will agree on a contract that maximizes the total surplus that they can generate. Hence, restrictions on the class of enforceable contracts can only reduce the total surplus. Yet, prohibiting certain contracts can be beneficial when there are transaction costs. For example, Spier and Whinston (1995) have shown that not enforcing a contract between two parties can be desirable when the contract has negative external effects on a third party (which does not participate in the contract due to transaction costs). It has also been argued that the presence of asymmetric information can make restrictions on the freedom of contract desirable, since such restrictions can prevent inefficient distortions due to signalling and screening., Similarly, when there are transaction costs due to moral hazard problems, restrictions on the freedom of contract can be welfare-enhancing. Furthermore, it can be desirable not to enforce certain contracts when agents are susceptible to cognitive biases. Finally, an important problem is whether contractual parties should have the freedom to restrict their own freedom to modify their contract in the future. Schmitz (2005) and Davis (2006) argue that it can be beneficial not to enforce non-renegotiation clauses in contracts.,  See also  *Free contract *Lochner era *Inequality of bargaining power *English contract law *United States contract law References *Atiyah, P.S: \\"The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract\\" (Oxford University Press, USA; New ed; Dec 12, 1985) *Bernstein, David E.: Freedom of Contract, George Mason Law & Economics Research Paper No. 08-51 (2008) *Trebilcock, Michael J.: \\"The Limits of Freedom of Contract\\" (Harvard University Press) Notes External links * Freedom to Contract by Dr. Edward Younkins Category:Classical liberalism Category:Contract law Category:Libertarian theory Category:Philosophy of law Category:Social philosophy ","title":"Freedom of contract"},{"id":"1970948","text":"Castoroides, or giant beaver, is an extinct genus of enormous, bear-sized beavers that lived in North America during the Pleistocene. Two species are currently recognized, C. dilophidus in the Southeastern US and C. ohioensis in the rest of its range. C. leiseyorum was previously described from the Irvingtonian of Florida, but is now regarded as an invalid name. All species previously described as C. leiseyorum are considered to belong to C. dilophidus. Description Restoration by Charles R. Knight Species of Castoroides were much larger than modern beavers. Their average length was approximately , and they could grow as large as . The weight of the giant beaver could vary from to . This makes it the largest known rodent in North America during the Pleistocene and the largest known beaver. However recent analyses suggest that they weighed some , but this is disputable. The hind feet of the giant beaver were much larger than in modern beavers, while the hind legs were shorter. The tail was longer and possibly was not paddle-shaped as in modern beavers . It can only be assumed that its feet were webbed as in modern species. The skull structure of the giant beaver shows that it presumably participated in extended underwater activity, thanks to the ability to take in more oxygen into its lungs. One of the defining characteristics of the giant beaver was their incisors, which differ in size and shape from those of modern beavers. Modern beavers have incisor teeth with smooth enamel, while the teeth of the giant beaver were much larger up to long, with a striated, textured enamel surface. One other major difference between the giant beaver and the modern beaver is that the size of its brain was proportionally smaller. As a result, the giant beaver may have had inferior interactions in its environment, as well as less complex patterns of thoughts and behavior.Canadian Museum of Nature, Notebooks: Giant Beaver Classification There are two known species: *Castoroides dilophidus (found in Florida and the southeastern states only) *Castoroides ohioensis, synonym Castoroides nebrascensis (found throughout continental United States and Canada) These two species of giant beaver (genus Castoroides) are not close relatives to modern beavers (genus Castor).

Castoroides had cutting teeth up to 15 cm-long with prominently-ridged outer surfaces. These strong enamel ridges would have acted as girders to support such long teeth. Further, the deep masseteric fossa of the lower jaw suggests a very powerful bite. Perhaps their teeth could have acted as both wood- cutters and gouges. There is no clear evidence that the giant beaver felled trees or built dams, but a possible lodge was discovered near New Knoxville, Ohio around 1912. Part of a giant beaver skull and the lodge were located in a peaty layer surrounded by loam. In Ohio, there have been claims of a possible giant beaver lodge four feet high and eight feet in diameter, formed from small saplings. The recent discovery of clear evidence for lodge building in the related genus Dipoides indicates that the giant beaver probably also built lodges. Remains of the giant beaver, along with Paleo Indian artifacts and the remains of the flat-headed peccary, giant short-faced bear, and the stag moose were found in the Sheriden Cave in Wyandot County, Ohio. Skeleton in Minnesota Science Museum Fossils of Castoroides are concentrated around the midwestern United States in states near the Great Lakes, particularly Illinois and Indiana, but specimens are recorded from Alaska and Canada to Florida. In Canada, fossils of this species are commonly found in the Old Crow Basin, Yukon, and single specimens are known from Toronto, Ontario and Indian Island, New Brunswick. A hitherto overlooked 1891 record of a Castoroides skull from near Highgate, Ontario is the earliest for Canada. In Old Crow region, Castoroides fossils occur in deposits of the Sangamonian interglacial. The discovery of giant beaver remains in New Brunswick adds significantly to the Quaternary terrestrial mammal fauna of New Brunswick, and suggests that the terrestrial fauna was probably richer than earlier evidence indicated. The known North American distribution of giant beaver is not significantly changed by this occurrence. Specimens from the southeastern US have been placed in a separate species, Castoroides dilophidus, based on differences in premolar and molar features. Martin (1969) considered it a subspecies, but new research by Hulbert et al. place them in their own species, Castoroides dilophidus., It is recorded from more than 25 Pleistocene localities in Florida, 23 of Rancholabrean age, one possibly of Irvingtonian age, and one of late Blancan age. Castoroides dilophidus specimens have been unearthed in Florida and South Carolina. The latter site (Cooper River) was dated at 1.8 million‚Äî11,000 years ago. The Castoroides leiseyorum was named by S. Morgan and J. A. White in 1995 for the Leisey shell pit ..Paleobiology Database, Collection 20403 and 20400.

Papers in Florida Paleontology 2.Alroy, J., Speciation and extinction in the fossil record of North American mammals. Ecological Reviews, 2008. These specimens are now considered to belong to C. dilophidus, C. leiseyorum is no longer a valid species name. Specimens were also found at the Strawberry Hill site, (Cooper River dredging) Charleston County, South Carolina from about 1.8 Mya to 11,000 years ago. Extinction Mounted skeleton Castoroides went extinct during the Pleistocene‚ÄìHolocene Transition 12,800‚Äì11,500 years ago, alongside several other iconic North American Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoths, mastodons, steppe bison, and so on. This roughly coincides with the arrival of the Clovis people in the region‚Äîwho rapidly colonized the area by 12,800 years ago‚Äîas well the beginning of an aridity trend. It has been long debated if humans (\\"overkill hypothesis\\") or climate change had a bigger effect in the extinction event, but they took several thousands of years to completely die out. There is no conclusive evidence that humans hunted Castoroides. Castoroides disappeared from Alaska and the Yukon about 18,000 years ago following the Last Glacial Maximum.

Starting as an independent underground filmmaker, Schlingensief later staged productions for theatres and festivals, often accompanied by public controversies. In the final years before his death, he staged Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival and worked at several opera houses, establishing himself as a Regietheater artist. Early life and education Schlingensief was born on 24 October 1960 in Oberhausen. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a pediatric nurse. As a child, he worked as an altar server and already made short films with a hand-held camera. Having passed his Abitur exams, he twice failed to gain admission to the University of Television and Film Munich. From 1981 he studied German language and literature, philosophy and art history at Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit√§t M√ºnchen, but also dabbled as a musician and finally dropped out in 1983 to work as an assistant to the experimental filmmaker Werner Nekes.William Grimes (August 25, 2010), Christoph Schlingensief, Artistic Provocateur, Dies at 49 The New York Times. After working as a teacher at Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Offenbach am Main and Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, he became a production manager on Hans W. Gei√üend√∂rfer's TV series Lindenstra√üe. Career Already as a young man Schlingensief had organized art events in the cellar of his parents' house, and local artists such as Helge Schneider or Theo J√∂rgensmann performed in his early short films. He considered himself a 'provocatively thoughtful' artist. He created numerous controversial and provocative theatre pieces as well as films, his former mentor being filmmaker and media artist Werner Nekes. = Film = Aino Laberenz (right), Alice Waters and Gaston Kabor√© Already Schlingensief's debut feature film, the surreal, absurd experimental Tunguska ‚Äì Die Kisten sind da! (\\"Tunguska ‚Äì The Crates Are Delivered!\\", 1984) was well received by critics. Growing up in the shadow of the New German Cinema, Schlingensief was deeply influenced by the likes of Rainer Werner Fassbinder‚Äîmany members of whose stock company of actors such as Udo Kier, Margit Carstensen, Irm Hermann or Volker Spengler became regulars in Schlingensief's films‚Äîor Alexander Kluge, with whom he collaborated on numerous occasions. To said period of film, Schlingensief delivered both a heartfelt homage as well as the final coup de gr√¢ce with The 120 Days of Bottrop‚Äîstarring Helmut Berger, playing an inept director's effort to remake Pier Paolo Pasolini's Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975)Ken Johnson (May 1, 2014), Former Auteur in Love With Outrage The New York Times.‚Äîin much the same way he dealt with German avant-garde cinema 15 years earlier with his first feature film Tunguska ‚Äì The Crates Are Delivered starring . Drawing parallels to the work of British filmmaker Derek Jarman, Egomania ‚Äì Island without Hope (1986) starred Kier and Tilda Swinton. Other influences include Luis Bu√±uel, Werner Schroeter or Herbert Achternbusch‚Äîand Schlingensief's filmic works have been compared to just as wide a range of filmmakers, from Jean-Luc Godard to Russ Meyer. With his \\"Germany Trilogy\\", consisting of 100 Years of Adolf Hitler ‚Äì The Last Hour in the F√ºhrerbunker, The German Chainsaw Massacre ‚Äì The First Hour of the Reunification and Terror 2000 ‚Äì Germany out of Control, Schlingensief came to prominence. Since then he shaped the cultural and political discourse in Germany for more than two decades and established himself as one of the country's most important and versatile artists. The \\"Germany Trilogy\\" deals with three turning points in 20th-century German history: the first movie Hundert Jahre Adolf Hitler (\\"A Hundred Years of Adolf Hitler\\", 1989) covers the last hours of Adolf Hitler, the second The German Chainsaw Massacre (1990), depicts the German reunification of 1990 and shows a group of East Germans who cross the border to visit West Germany and get slaughtered by a psychopathic West German family with chainsaws, and the third Terror 2000 (1992) focuses on xenophobic violence after the reunification process. One of Schlingensief's central tactics was to call politicians' bluff in an attempt to reveal the inanities of their \\"responsible\\" discourse, a tactic he called \\"playing something through to its end\\". This strategy was most notable in his work Please Love Austria (alternately named Foreigners out! Schlingensiefs Container) at the time of the FP√ñ and √ñVP coalition in Austria, a work which attracted international support, a media frenzy and countless debates about art practice. In 2009, he joined the jury of the Berlin International Film Festival under Tilda Swinton. =Television= Schlingensief soon became a figure of considerable celebrity and notoriety in Germany, thanks to several popular television projects. Broadcast in 1997, Talk 2000 was a talk show with celebrity guests in which Schlingensief sometimes interrupted interviews to discuss his own personal problems. In U3000 (2000), he and his crew were filmed acting crazily on platforms and in cars of the Berlin subway system; the program aired on MTV Germany. In Freakstars 3000 (2003), a six-part American Idol-style parody, two dozen people from an assisted-living home for the mentally disabled competed for spots in a new band. = Art = In 1997, Schlingesief staged an art action at the documenta X exhibition in Kassel as part of the performance space \\"Hybrid WorkSpace,\\" which was curated by Klaus Biesenbach, Nancy Spector and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. During the performance, Schlingensief was arrested for carrying a placard with the words \\"Kill Helmut Kohl!\\". In November 1999, invited by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and organized by Klaus Biesenbach, Schlingensief carried out a performance at the Statue of Liberty in New York City, where, kneeling down at the foot of the statue, he handed Germany over to globalization. His exhibition \\"The Last Hour\\", with its twisted metalwork from a crashed car, footage of a long tunnel and paparazzi pictures of Princess Diana, was in 2006 rejected by the Frieze Art Fair in London's Regent's Park and instead ended up in a little-known gallery space in Bethnal Green.Christoph Schlingensief obituary The Daily Telegraph, October 31, 2010. He later joined the Hauser & Wirth gallery. In 2007, the Haus der Kunst, Munich, mounted an exhibition of Schlingensief's work; it presented African Twin Towers and short films that have been shot while the artist directed The Flying Dutchman at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil.Christoph Schlingensief, \\"18 Images a Second\\", May 25 ‚Äì September 16, 2007 Haus der Kunst, Munich. = Theatre = Schlingensief speaking at the Deutschlandsuche 99 performance in front of the Volksb√ºhne, 1999 In the 1990s, Schlingensief directed a series of chaotic, satirical productions at the Volksb√ºhne theatre in Berlin. He also directed a version of Hamlet, subtitled, This is your Family, Nazi~Line, which premiered in Switzerland, the so-called neutral territory equated with the Denmark of the opening line in Shakespeare's play where there is something foul afoot. Events around the piece questioned and attacked Switzerland's 'neutrality' in the face of growing racism and extreme right wing movements. The artist duo Ubermorgen provided the Internet platform Nazi~Line Nazi~Line for the project, where former members of Neo Nazi groups were sought and then cast as actors to play characters in the drama on stage as a way of re-integrating the ex-Neo- Nazis with the common workforce of the theatre. Schlingensief's work covered a variety of media, including installation and the ubiquitous 'talk show' and has in many cases led to audience members leaving the theatre space with Schlingensief and his colleagues to take part in events such as Passion Impossible, Wake Up Call for Germany 1997 or Chance 2000, Vote for Yourself in which he formed the Last Chance Party where anyone could become a candidate themselves in the run up to the federal election of 1998 in Germany. The same year he made a performance project for an Austrian Festival for new art Steirischer Herbst called Chance 2000 for Graz: eight pillars were built at the central Marienplatz square, where homeless people were invited to sit on, and the deal was that the one who sat there longest could win 7,000 shillings, plus every day the artist threw 20,000 shillings on passers-by in front of the eyes of those who sat on the pillars.Christoph Schlingensief Chance 2000 f√ºr Graz OFFSITE GRAZ. The project was interrupted with help of the right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, that collected 10,000 signatures against it. With his demands for people to \\"prove they exist\\" in an age of total TV coverage and \\"act, act, act\\" in the sense of becoming active not 'actors', his work could be considered a direct legacy of Bertolt Brecht, as it demands involvement as opposed to passivity and merely looking on as is the case in traditional text-based theatre. In an age of extreme media fatigue, his was a fresh voice albeit and undisputedly containing echoes of the past, often humorous and subversive yet never cynical. His influences included Joseph Beuys and his idea of social sculpture, and artists Allan Kaprow and Dieter Roth. At the time of his death, he was involved in productions for the RuhrtriennaleShirley Apthorp (August 23, 2010), Schlingensief, Who Put Putrid Bunny on Bayreuth Stage, Is Dead Bloomberg. and for the Berlin Staatsoper's \\"Metanoia\\".George Loomis (October 12, 2010), The New Opera 'Metanoia' Goes On, but Without Its Provocateur The New York Times. = Opera = In 2004, at the invitation of Wolfgang and Katharina Wagner and to rave reviews,Jeremy Eichler (July 27, 2004), A Hullabaloo For an Opening At Bayreuth The New York Times. he staged Richard Wagner's Parsifal for the Bayreuth Festival. When he accepted the Wagner family's invitation, it caused surprise because of his iconoclasm and his well-known aversion to all things tainted by association with Hitler; however, he had been invited to the festival before in 1991.John Rochwell (June 22, 2003), The Weird Twilight of a Wagner The New York Times. Film clips and costumes focused the action on the conflict between Christianity and Islam. The production, in the first years conducted by Pierre Boulez, was revived in 2005 and 2006, but unlike other Bayreuth Festival stagings it was not filmed. Christian Kracht would later describe \\"the likes of Wolfgang Wagner\\" as \\"bourgeois & enemy to Christoph Schlingensief.\\"Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), pp. 91, 94. In his last productions, such as the fluxus oratorio Church of Fear and the ready made opera Mea culpa, he staged his own cancer experience,Kaspar M√ºhlemann: Christoph Schlingensief und seine Auseinandersetzung mit Joseph Beuys. Mit einem Nachwort von Anna-Catharina Gebbers und einem Interview mit Carl Hegemann (Europ√§ische Hochschulschriften, Reihe 28: Kunstgeschichte, Bd. 439), Peter Lang Verlag, Frankfurt am Main u.a. 2011, and related it to his first 'stage experience' as a young altar boy. = Opera Village Africa = Schlingensief's commitment to developing nations later took him to Burkina Faso, where he was awarded a concession to build an opera house, arguably his most ambitious project. The project, which received funding from the German government, was also to include a theater and film school, and an infirmary. Construction began in January 2010, near Ouagadougou, and was later continued under the guidance of Schlingensief's wife and long-time assistant Aino Laberenz, whom he married in 2009. In 2012, numerous internationally renowned artists have donated works for a fundraising auction at the Hamburger Bahnhof, among them Marina Abramoviƒá, Pipilotti Rist, Georg Baselitz, Christo, Olafur Eliasson, Andreas Gursky, Wolfgang Tillmans and G√ºnther Uecker. Patti Smith, a friend of Schlingensief for many years, contributed a drawing that she made in the summer of 2010 during a joint exhibition in Munich. Death After learning he had lung cancer in early 2008, Schlingensief wrote about his illness and in 2009 published \\"Heaven Could Not Be as Beautiful as Here: A Cancer Diary.\\" Also, he already organised part of his estate and entrusted it for archiving to the Berlin Academy of the Arts. He died on August 21, 2010 in Berlin, Germany at age 49. In a note to his death in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Literature Nobel Prize Laureate Elfriede Jelinek wrote: > \\"Schlingensief was one of the greatest artists who ever lived. I always > thought one like him cannot die. It is as if life itself had died. He was > not really a stage director (in spite of Bayreuth and Parsifal), he was > everything: he was the artist as such.

Organized by curator Susanne Gaensheimer, who completed the exhibition after Schlingensief's death, the German pavilion was transformed into a replica of the church where the artist spent his teenage years as an altar boy in order to present \\"Fluxus Oratorio,\\" the second of his three-part final work, created after he had undergone surgery to remove a lung. The exhibition presented multimedia documents‚Äîfrom videos to x-rays‚Äîrelating to his battle with terminal cancer. A side room showed footage and a maquette made as part of Schlingensief's project to build an opera house in Burkina Faso, while another wing displayed a selection of films from throughout his career. In an interview with Berliner Zeitung, artist Gerhard Richter had previously criticised Schlingensief's appointment as \\"a scandal\\", associating the selection of the multitasking director with \\"the decline of painting.\\"RICHTER CRITICIZES GERMAN PAVILION Artforum.

They briefly served as part of the Alliance government, alongside the Liberal Party and Residents Rally. When the 1989 election was held, the No Self-Government Party emerged as the larger of the two anti-self-government groups in the Assembly, electing three members, Craig Duby, Carmel Maher and David Prowse. However, unlike Dennis Stevenson's Abolish Self-Government Coalition, the No Self-Government Party's focus soon began to change from their original single-issue basis. The first vote of the new Assembly saw Prowse voted in as the Speaker by the members. In late 1989, Residents Rally, who were supporting the Follett Labor government, began discussions aimed at forming a coalition government with the Liberals. They then turned to the No Self-Government Party, who accepted the offer. However, as opposition to self-government itself was a core basis of their party, and it would have been seen as somewhat odd for them to then join a government, Duby, and Maher disbanded the party, and reformed as the Independents Group. Prowse joined the Liberal party in July 1990. The new party then became the third member of the Alliance government, and Duby, the old party's former leader, became Minister for Urban Services. Prowse retained his position as Speaker. Whilst Duby was a vocal member of the government, and was often heard in the Assembly and media, Maher tended to be a less significant player in ACT politics. Nevertheless, the party were vital in sustaining the Alliance government for its eighteen-month lifespan. As long as the Alliance survived, however, they nevertheless maintained influence in decision-making. This was to end when the Liberal Party and Residents Rally fell out in late 1991, causing Residents Rally to move a no-confidence motion in the government. The Follett Labor government with Residents Rally and independents support returned to power. Prowse retained the Speakership. Soon after, on 19 November, realising that the Independents Group was effectively dead, Duby quit the party to form the Hare-Clark Independent Party. With her influence in the Assembly reduced to practically nil, Maher continued under the Independents Group until the 1992 election. Both Maher and Prowse retired at the election, and though Duby contested the election with his new party, he lost his seat. By the 1995 election, the Independents Group was entirely dead, with none its members playing any further role in ACT politics.

A painter also named Giovanni da Udine was exiled from his native city in 1472.A History of Painting in North Italy: Venice, Padua, Vicenza..., Volume 2, By Joseph Archer Crowe, Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle, page 175. Biography As a student and assistant of Raphael, he was responsible for most of the \\"decorative\\" (i.e. non-narrative) elements of the major Raphaellesque projects in Rome, and he was a specialist in fresco and stucco grotesque decorations. These included the stucco work in the Loggia di Raffaello (Vatican, 1517‚Äì1519) and the heavy fruit-laden wreaths in the loggia di psiche in the Villa Farnesina. He also assisted in the construction of a few monumental fountains, which are now destroyed. He is also known for his drawings of birds and fruit. Decoration for Loggia of Cardinal Bibbiena Loggia di Psiche frescoes Stucco Discovery One of his well-known discoveries is the art of Stucco, that Giovanni was the \\"new-founder\\" of after antiquity: occasioned by the discovery of the Domus Aurea, Nero's residence near the Colosseum: in the first year of the 16th century Raphael and his students went down \\"Mons Coelius\\" into tunnels that were formed to explore that area. With candles and torches they explored the caves and looked at the walls onto which were painted little heavy coloured figures that were named \\"grottesche (pl.), grottesca (s.)\\" because in the darkness, these images seemed like paint in ancient caves that in Italian was -and is- said like above. There was a strange \\"pictorial relief\\" onto which some of this \\"grottesche\\" were realised: it was Roman stucco, an important technique that the ancient Romans utilised to reproduce a marble effect, real marble was already too expensive by that time even for the Imperator (we have to think that there were all a \\"Domus\\" in marble, for a size as like as a range of KM 1.5 - 2 around Colosseum, it was the most famous residence of the Roman Empire). After the death of Raphael, da Udine continued to work on projects initiated by his master, namely the Villa Madama in Rome. He continued his work until the sack of Rome (1527) when he departed to work in Florence, where he worked on the stuccoes in Sagrestia Nuova in San Lorenzo, and Venice, where he worked on the stucco decoration in the Palazzo Grimani, around 1540. In Udine, he worked as an architect on the Torre dell'Orologio (Clock-Tower) and the Fontana di Piazza Nuova (Piazza Nuova Fountain). In Cividale, he helped in the construction of Santa Maria dei Battuti. He returned to Rome in 1560 to work on the third floor of the Logge Vaticane, and died in this city in 1564.

They have simple or pinnate leaves, flowers arranged in panicles at or near the ends of branchlets and fruit that is a woody capsule containing winged seeds. They grow naturally in Australia, the Moluccas, New Guinea and New Caledonia. Description Trees in the genus Flindersia have simple or pinnate leaves with up to sixteen leaflets, the side leaflets arranged in opposite pairs. The flowers are arranged in panicles at the ends of branchlets or in upper leaf axils and have five sepals and five petals. The flowers are bisexual, or sometimes only have stamens. There are five stamens opposite the sepals, alternating with five staminodes. The ovary has five locules and is more or less spherical with five shallow lobes and there are between four and six ovules in each locule. The fruit is a woody capsule splitting into five and contains brown, winged seeds. Taxonomy The genus Flindersia was first formally described in 1814 by Robert Brown in Matthew Flinders' sea voyage journal A Voyage to Terra Australis. Brown named the type species, Flindersia australis in the same journal from specimens collected near Broad Sound in September 1802. =Species list= The following is a list of species accepted by the Australian Plant Census, or The Plant List* for species outside Australia: * Flindersia acuminata C.T.White ‚Äì silver silkwood, silver maple (Qld.) * Flindersia amboinensis Poir.* ‚Äì (Moluccas to New Guinea) * Flindersia australis R.Br. ‚Äì Australian teak, crows ash (Qld., N.S.W.) * Flindersia bennettii F.Muell. ex C.Moore ‚Äì Bennett's ash (Qld., N.S.W.) * Flindersia bourjotiana F.Muell. ‚Äì Queensland silver ash (Qld.) * Flindersia brassii T.G.Hartley & B.Hyland ‚Äì hard scented maple, Claudie River scented maple ‚Äì (Qld.) * Flindersia brayleyana F.Muell. ‚Äì Queensland maple, maple silkwood (Qld.) * Flindersia collina F.M.Bailey ‚Äì broad-leaved leopard tree (Qld., N.S.W.) * Flindersia dissosperma (F.Muell.)

Entering service in 1943, the ship saw action during World War II, participating in the Battle of Tarawa. Following the war the destroyer was placed in reserve, remaining in this state until 1972. She was sold for scrap in 1974. Construction and career Schroeder was laid down on 25 June 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company Kearny, New Jersey and launched on 11 November 1942, sponsored by Miss Grace Wainwright Schroeder. The destroyer was commissioned on 1 January 1943, Commander J. T. Bowers in command. = 1943 = Schroeder provided escort for two separate aircraft carriers making shakedown cruises to the Caribbean and a convoy of merchant ships bound for Casablanca before steaming to the Pacific. After an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, she steamed west and joined Destroyer Squadron 25 (DesRon 25) at Pearl Harbor on 28 July 1943. Schroeder assisted in screening the carrier task force which attacked Marcus Island on 1 September. While bombarding Wake Island early the next month, she was taken under fire for the first time but suffered no casualties. After the Wake Island bombardment, Schroeder sailed to the New Hebrides Islands for training with amphibious forces. In early November, she joined the Gilbert Islands invasion force. On the morning of 20 November, Schroeder was in the bombardment group that shelled the eastern coast of Tarawa Atoll. She entered the lagoon early the next morning to provide fire support for the Marines landing on Tarawa. In addition to fire support, the destroyer also acted as a first aid ship for wounded Marines. Schroeder departed Tarawa on 24 November for Pearl Harbor for repairs, as she had damaged her screws on a coral reef in the lagoon. = 1944 = Schroeder was back with her division, on 1 February 1944, when it screened transports and provided fire support for the assault on Kwajalein Island. She remained in the Marshalls for several weeks and, from 20 to 24 February, bombarded Maloelap and Wotje Atolls. On 1 March, she sailed to the New Hebrides Islands where she participated in more training exercises. On 20 March, Schroeder and her division bombarded Japanese coast defenses at Kavieng, New Ireland, with nearly 900 rounds of ammunition; departing for Efate in the evening. Schroeder loaded ammunition at Espiritu Santo and on 1 April, escorted Pocomoke and SS Red Rover to Guadalcanal; joined a merchant convoy there, and escorted it to Milne Bay, New Guinea. Later in the month, she participated in the bombardment of enemy positions at Hollandia; and, then screened transports and LSTs at Humboldt Bay. She performed fighter director duties until 30 April when she departed with a convoy for Cape Sudest and, later, to Buna. Schroeder operated in the Purvis Bay-Guadalcanal area until she departed for Kwajalein, on 4 June, as a unit of Task Group 53.1 (TG 53.1). The TG was at Eniwetok on 28 June where Schroeder underwent a period of upkeep and logistics. On 11 July the DD and her division departed for the Mariana Islands. From 16 to 20 July, the division bombarded the Tumon area of Guam. Schroeder then served on picket duty until 4 August when she escorted a convoy back to Eniwetok. After returning to Espiritu Santo for a period of upkeep and logistics, she sailed for Humboldt Bay on 22 August. Schroeder was assigned to TG 77.5 which sortied, on 13 September, for the invasion of Morotai, Netherlands East Indies. She screened LSTs in their approach to Pitoe Bay and then served on picket duty until departing for Humboldt Bay on 21 September. The destroyer sailed, on 13 October, with TF 78 for Panoan Island, P.I. She entered Leyte Gulf at midnight, 19 October, with a group of transports, and, the next morning, began performing ASW and fighter director duties. On 25 October, she withdrew from the area and sailed for San Francisco. She arrived there on 23 November and underwent a period of overhaul and availability. = 1945 = On 11 January 1945, Schroeder moved down the coast to San Diego. Departing there on 20 January, the veteran destroyer was back in Ulithi on 7 February where she joined TF 58, the Fast Carrier Task Force. The task force sortied on 10 February. On 16 and 17 February, the carriers launched attacks against airfields, aircraft factories, and shipping in the Tokyo area. The next day, the flattops launched strikes against the Volcano Islands in preparation for the forthcoming assault against that Japanese bastion. Schroeder returned to Ulithi in early March, but, by 23 March, was again operating off the Japanese home islands. Detached from the task group on 31 March, she and proceeded to Ulithi. She sailed from there on 10 April as a unit of TG 50.8, which was proceeding to Okinawa to support the landings there. On 16 April, the destroyer, supporting the landing on Ie Shima, was at general quarters nine different times to repel enemy air attacks. Five days later, Schroeder with DesDiv 49, bombarded the western side of Minami Daito Shima. The bombardment caused many fires ashore but brought no return gunfire from the enemy positions. Schroeder returned to Ulithi, from 27 April to 9 May, for a period of upkeep, replenishment, and recreation. She rejoined the fast carriers three days later as they conducted bombing and photographic missions over Ky≈´sh≈´. Four days later, they supported the troops on southern Okinawa. Task Force 58 entered San Pedro Bay, on 13 June for an upkeep period. It sortied on 1 July, and, on 10 July, the carriers launched sustained strikes against Tokyo. On 17‚Äì18 July, strikes were launched against targets in the Tokyo-Yokohama area. On 31 July Schroeder shelled Shimizu, Honsh≈´ Island. On 6 September, with hostilities ended, the task force entered Tokyo Bay and dissolved its units. Schroeder was ordered to join TF 11 at Okinawa and proceed to Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 1 October, with orders assigning her to the east coast. On 2 November 1945, the destroyer entered the Charleston Navy Yard, South Carolina, and prepared for deactivation. Schroeder was decommissioned on 29 April 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained in reserve until 1 October 1972 when she was struck from the Navy List. Schroeder was sold to Southern Materials Co., Ltd., New Orleans, Louisiana, on 1 January 1974. Honors Schroeder received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

Early life and education Thomas Brendan Wilson was born in Trinidad, Colorado to British parents, and moved to Britain with his family when he was 17 months old. The family settled in the Glasgow, Scotland area where he lived and worked for the remainder of his life. Wilson was educated in Glasgow before taking an undergraduate course at St. Mary‚Äôs College, Aberdeen. He then studied Music at the University of Glasgow, where he continued as a postgraduate, receiving a doctorate (DMus). He served in the Royal Air Force from 1945 to 1948. Career One of the first honours graduates in music from Glasgow University, Wilson became a lecturer at his alma mater in 1957. He was later appointed a Reader (1971) and given a Personal Chair in 1977. He consistently played an active part in the musical life of the UK, holding executive and advisory positions in such organisations as the Scottish Arts Council, The New Music Group of Scotland, The Society for the Promotion of New Music, The Composers' Guild of Great Britain (Chairman 1986-89) now the British Association of Composers and Songwriters, and The Scottish Society of Composers (of which he was a founder member). His works have been played all over the world and embrace all forms - orchestral, choral-orchestral, chamber-orchestral, opera, ballet, brass band, vocal music of different kinds, and works for a wide variety of chamber ensembles and solo instruments. Wilson completed five symphonies, the fourth of which, Passeleth Tapestry, was premiered by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra under Bryden Thomson on 6 August 1988 in Paisley Abbey. He also completed several concertos and choral works. His largest work was an opera, Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1972‚Äì75), commissioned by Scottish Opera and based on the novel by James Hogg. Wilson was awarded the CBE in 1990. The following year he was awarded an honorary DMus Degree from Glasgow University and created a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The 80th anniversary of Wilson's birth on 10 October 1927 was marked by a performance of the composer's St Kentigern Suite on 17 January 2008 by the RSAMD Chamber Orchestra, and by a performance of the composer's Violin Concerto also in January 2008 by the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland. A biography co- written by David Griffith and Margaret Wilson and edited by Prof. Karl Gwiasda has been completed and published in 2011 to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of his death.  Death  Wilson died on 12 June 2001.

Laycock was thus a half-brother of the 7th Marquess of Downshire; their sister Josephine (died 1958) married Edward Greenall, 2nd Lord Daresbury, and is grandmother of the present Baron. Through his father's relationship with the married Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, issue occurring before and during his marriage with Kitty, Robert Laycock was half-brother to the Countess of Warwick's son Maynard Greville (1898-1960), and daughter, Mercy Greville (1904-1968). Laycock was educated at Lockers Park School and Eton College, followed by officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which he emerged as a well-read young man with a scientific bent. He also briefly worked in a factory.

Governor of Malta In 1954, his old friend, Anthony Head, now Secretary of State for War appointed Laycock to the position of Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta. This was during a period of tensions surrounding a drive for independence, with Prime Minister Dom Mintoff leading a campaign for \\"Integration (with Britain) or Self-Determination\\", and the Nationalist Party looking for a \\"Quasi-Dominion Status. Prior to his assuming the position of Governor, Queen Elizabeth knighted Laycock in the drawing room of Sledmere House, Yorkshire whilst staying as fellow house guests of Sir Richard Sykes, Baronet. Laycock served until 1959, having had his term extended twice. Last years Laycock suffered from severe circulatory problems, which meant constant pain in one leg. He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in 1962. A noted horseman, yachtsman and historical book collector, his interests made him a man who could enjoy life. It was said by many he had no enemies. While walking back from Sunday church services on 10 March 1968, Laycock suffered a massive heart attack and died. His estate was probated at ¬£279,910.

Datalog is the language typically used to specify facts, rules and queries in deductive databases. Deductive databases have grown out of the desire to combine logic programming with relational databases to construct systems that support a powerful formalism and are still fast and able to deal with very large datasets. Deductive databases are more expressive than relational databases but less expressive than logic programming systems. In recent years, deductive databases such as Datalog have found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing.Datalog and Emerging applications Deductive databases reuse many concepts from logic programming; rules and facts specified in the deductive database language Datalog look very similar to those in Prolog. However important differences between deductive databases and logic programming: * Order sensitivity and procedurality: In Prolog, program execution depends on the order of rules in the program and on the order of parts of rules; these properties are used by programmers to build efficient programs. In database languages (like SQL or Datalog), however, program execution is independent of the order of rules and facts. * Special predicates: In Prolog, programmers can directly influence the procedural evaluation of the program with special predicates such as the cut, this has no correspondence in deductive databases. * Function symbols: Logic Programming languages allow function symbols to build up complex symbols. This is not allowed in deductive databases. * Tuple-oriented processing: Deductive databases use set-oriented processing while logic programming languages concentrate on one tuple at a time.

It is primarily used to treat atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and psoriasis in both adults and children. It has a fairly good safety profile and is available as a cream, ointment, lotion, and as a foam under the tradename Verdeso Foam. Other trade names for creams, lotions, and ointments include Tridesilon, DesOwen, Desonate. It is a group VI corticosteroid under US classification, the second least potent group. Medical uses Desonide is a prescription topical treatment for redness, swelling, itching, and discomfort of various skin conditions. Regardless of the vehicle used, desonide is applied 2 to 3 times a day, at the same times each day. Skin conditions typically improve in the first two weeks of treatment. Patients are instructed to use desonide for the minimum amount of time necessary for conditions to improve.  Adverse effects  The safety of desonide has not been determined beyond 4 weeks of use. Patients with allergies to corticosteroids (like hydrocortisone or prednisone) should use caution when taking desonide. Pharmacists and prescribing physicians should be aware that this medication may contain inactive ingredients than can cause allergic reactions. Desonide should not be used if there is an infection or open wound in the treatment area. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce adverse effects. Indication of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria have been observed in some patients receiving treatment. After stopping treatment, reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency is possible. The cosyntropin (ACTH1-24) laboratory test can evaluate patients for HPA axis suppression. HPA function can be reversed after the cessation of treatment or replacement with another less potent corticosteroid. If glucocorticosteroid insufficiency occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be required. Side effects of desonide requiring immediate contact with the prescribing physician: * Blistering, burning, crusting, dryness, or flaking of the skin * burning, itching, redness, skin rash, swelling, or soreness at the application site * flushing or redness of the skin * irritation * itching, scaling, severe redness, soreness, or swelling of the skin * peeling of the skin * raised, dark red, wart-like spots on the skin, especially when used on the face * stinging and burning * unusually warm skin Side effects that may go away as the body adjusts to the medication: * Body aches or pain * chills * cough * difficulty with breathing * ear congestion * fever * headache * loss of voice * nasal congestion * runny nose * sneezing * sore throat * unusual tiredness or weakness = Pregnancy = The FDA has labeled desonide as pregnancy category C. Desonide should only be used during pregnancy when absolutely necessary. = Breastfeeding = It is currently unknown whether topical application of Desonide can pass into breast milk. Similar drugs taken orally have been seen to pass into breast milk. The prescribing doctor should be consulted prior to breast-feeding.  Mechanism of action  Desonide is a synthetic nonfluorinated corticosteroid; topical corticosteroids have anti- inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of these properties, however, is unclear for the dermal route of administration. Following absorption through the skin, corticosteroids follow pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to intravenously administered corticosteroids. The mechanism of corticosteroids is thought to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Lipocortins control the biosynthesis of inflammation mediators, like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Lipocortins can inhibit the common precursor of inflammation mediators, arachidonic acid.  Interactions  Common medications causing a minor negative drug interaction include: Insulin and Metformin. Common medications checked in combination, but that are not known to create a negative drug interaction, include: Aspirin, Cymbalta (duloxetine), Fish Oil, Acetaminophen, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, and Zyrtec.  History  Desonide was first introduced in the United States under the trade name Tridesilon by Dome Laboratories in 1970. Since the discovery in the United States, several other countries have introduced different brand names of desonide, including Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Germany. The FDA first approved Connetics Corporation‚Äôs Verdeso Foam¬Æ on September 16, 2006. Just shortly after, the FDA approved SkinMedica Inc.‚Äôs Desonate¬Æ hydrogel delivery vehicle on October 20, 2006. Desonate¬Æ gel is currently manufactured by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Whippany, NJ. DesOwen¬Æ creams, ointments, and lotions are currently manufactured by DPT Laboratories, Ltd. in San Antonio Texas and is marketed by Galderma Laboratories. Other suppliers for the generic desonide include Rebel Distributors Corp and Perrigo New York Inc. = Research and clinical trials = Desonate was approved by the FDA following two major clinical trials in 2006. Each randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 582 pediatric patients (between the ages of 3 months and 18 years). The patient was topically administered the drug or placebo two times a day for four weeks. Using the Investigator‚Äôs Global Severity Score (IGSS), the treatment was considered successful if at Week 4 there was at least a two (2) point decrease from the patient‚Äôs baseline IGSS. In clinical trial 1, 44% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 14% treated with the placebo. In clinical trial 2, 28% of patients succeeded successful treatment of Desonate versus 6% treated with the placebo. The FDA approved Tridesilon for the following treatments: Contact Dermatitis, Rhus Dermatitis, Eczema, Dermatitis, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, Granuloma Annulare, Seborrheic Dermatitis, Polymorphous Light Eruption, Pruritus, Psoriasis, Lichen Simplex, Atopic Dermatitis, Lichen Planus, Xerosis, Exfoliative Dermatitis. Recently, in late 2014, phase 3 clinical trials were completed to evaluate treatments using Desonide cream versus amino acid moisturizing cream. Patients with eczema or atopic dermatitis could be enrolled in this study, both male and female, over the age of 18. The randomized, double-blind, active control, 5-week study compared the effects of treatment of both creams through twice-a- day application. The clinical trial is sponsored by NeoStrata Company, Inc. No research has been completed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photoco- carcinogenic potential of desonide. Additionally, no research has been completed to determine the effect on fertility. These are current opportunities for improvement to learn more about the risks and benefits associated with desonide. = Regulatory = The first US. patent for desonide was US4185100A was granted on January 22, 1980. The patent was for topical anti-inflammatory treatment using desonide. The patent defends the suitability of the anti-inflammatory for the treatment of cutaneous disorders or disruptions characterized by skin inflammation and/or hyperproliferative activity in the epidermis. Side effects and the mechanism of action are both disclosed. This patent is currently expired. = Cost = Desonide topical cream and ointment is sold in 15g and 60g tubes of %0.05 gel, and desonide lotion is sold in 2 fluid ounce bottles. A single 60g tube or one (1) bottle of lotion costs as much as $200.

It can vary from 5 mm in length when hatched to approximately in mature adults. The New Zealand flatworm is considered an invasive species in parts of Europe. Description The ventral surface of the flatworm is a pale buff colour while the dorsal surface is dark brown. Young flatworms vary in colour from white to pale orange and develop their adult colouration as they grow. During the day, flatworms can be found resting on the surface of soil underneath objects in close contact with the ground. They may also be found beneath the soil surface hunting for earthworms. Reproduction involves the production of egg capsules of about 8 mm in length. The capsules are shiny, flexible and cherry red in colour at first and later darken to black after several days. After an unknown incubation period, several pale, tiny flatworms hatch out of the brittle capsule. One egg capsule is produced at a time with the bulge clearly visible in the dorsum of the adult worm. = Locomotion = When at rest, A. triangulatus rolls itself up and can appear like a very tiny Swiss roll. When it starts to move, it uncurls, at the same time as the circular muscles beneath the epidermal cells at the anterior end contract. The paler head-end extends forward, becoming as thin as the lead in a pencil. During movement it is repeatedly raised a couple of millimetres from the substratum before being lowered again. As movement continues, circular, diagonal and longitudinal muscles in the rest of the body contract. Friction between the ventral surface and the substratum is reduced by mucus produced by the ciliated epidermal cells. A. triangulatus can achieve speeds of up to 17 m per hour. Invasive species The New Zealand flatworm is an invasive species in Europe, feeding there almost exclusively on earthworms.Jones, H. D. 2005: Identification: British land flatworms. British Wildlife, 16, 189-194. Full text This degrades soil quality. European earthworm predators are reluctant to eat it although cases of frogs and beetle larvae consuming flatworms have been recorded. It has been seen in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Faroe Islands. It might have arrived in the early 1960s, being first recorded in Belfast in 1963. The New Zealand flatworm is easily transported accidentally in plant pots in adult or egg form. They tend to be common in garden centres and may have arrived in the UK with exotic plants. It has been suggested that they might thrive in parts of western Norway, southern Sweden, Denmark, Germany and northern parts of Poland, if they invade these regions.Boag, B., Evans, K.A., Neilson, R., Yeates, G.W., Johns, P.M., Mather, J.G., and Christensen, O.M.

The francophones of France generally use Metropolitan French (spoken in Paris and considered standard) although some also use regional dialects or varieties such as Meridional French. In Europe outside France there are Belgian French, Swiss French, and in Italy Aostan French. In Canada, French is an official language along with English; the two main dialects of French in Canada are Quebec French and Acadian French, but also another dialect commonly grouped as Canadian French, used by Anglophones speaking French as a second language or by Francophones in Canada using a different dialect. In Lebanon, French was an official language until 1941 and the main dialect spoken there is Lebanese French or Levantine French. Note that the discussion here refers to varieties of the French language, not to the Romance sister languages (sometimes considered dialects) of French spoken in France (e.g. Picard, Limousin, Gascon, etc.; for these languages see: Langues d'o√Øl, Francoproven√ßal, Occitan and languages of France). See also French-based creole languages, which are also considered separate languages.  Africa  French is an administrative language and is commonly but unofficially used in the Maghreb states, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. As of 2006, an estimated 115 million African people spread across 31 African countries can speak French either as a first or second language, making Africa the continent with the most French speakers in the world. La Francophonie dans le monde 2006-2007 published by the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. Nathan, Paris, 2007 While there are many varieties of African French, common features include the use of an alveolar trill and use of borrowed words from local languages. Canada =Acadian= Acadian French is a variant of French spoken by francophone Acadians in the Canadian Maritime provinces, the Saint John River Valley in the northern part of the U.S. state of Maine, the Magdalen Islands and Havre- Saint-Pierre, along the St. Lawrence's north shore. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian dialects have some difficulty understanding Acadian French. Notable features include and becoming and and becoming before front vowels and the use of some archaic words. Chiac Chiac is a dialect of combined Acadian French and English and is spoken mainly around Moncton, New Brunswick. The pronunciation of French words is very different from other dialects and resembles English pronunciation. Chiac cannot be identified solely on its frequent use of English words since many other French dialects use many English words as well, but Chiac has an unusual amount of English. Chiac French has developed through proximity to English-speakers who settled nearby during the colonial period. Sounds that are characteristic of Chiac are the different use of the letters \\"d\\", \\"t\\", \\"r\\", and \\"c\\" (such as the word \\"bec\\", normally spoken in French with a softer \\"c\\" sound but spoken as \\"beck\\" with a hard \\"c\\" as in the English pronunciation). Other differences include the use of vowel sounds such as \\"ea\\", \\"eo\\", \\"on\\", \\"an\\", and \\"oi\\". Such English-stylized pronunciations are different from other dialects of North American French such as Qu√©b√©cois and Brayon. Some forms of Chiac deviate from the original language to the extent that it is nearly incomprehensible to the larger francophone community. Chiac is perhaps best categorized as a creole language alongside Haitian Creole and Louisiana Creole, French dialects that incorporate Indigenous, African, and other European languages, as opposed to dialects such as Qu√©b√©cois and Brayon that deviate slightly from Metropolitan French but are nonetheless derived primarily from earlier dialects of French with little contribution from other source languages. =Newfoundland= Newfoundland French is a regional dialect of French that was once spoken by settlers in the French colony of Newfoundland. =Quebec= Quebec French is the dominant and most prevalent regional variety of French found in Canada. Although Quebec French constitutes a coherent and standard system, it has no objective norm since the very organization mandated to establish it, the Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise, believes that objectively standardizing Quebec French would lead to reduced inter intelligibility with other French communities around the world. =Ontario= Ontario French is often divided into two categories: North and South. The further north the more French is spoken and the closer the dialect and culture is to Quebec French. The further south, the French becomes a more pronounced French with a more English cultural influence as well as a Parisian grammar and dialect structure, as both Parisian and Canadian French are taught in the French immersion schools. Notable features include , , and as allophones of , , and in closed syllables and affrication of and to and before and (the word tu is pronounced ). Long vowels are generally diphthongized in closed syllables (the word f√™te is pronounced ). United States Several varieties of French emerged in the United States: Louisiana French, New England French and the nearly-extinct Frenchville French, Missouri French, Muskrat French and M√©tis French. =Louisiana= Louisiana French, the largest of the groupings, is spoken mostly in Louisiana and derives from the forms of the language spoken by the colonists of lower French Louisiana. Louisiana French is traditionally into three dialects: Colonial French, Modern Louisiana French or \\"Acadian\\" French, and Louisiana Creole French. Colonial French was originally the dialect spoken by the land-holding educated classes. Acadian, the dialect of the Acadians who came to French Louisiana in droves following their expulsion from Acadia during the French and Indian War, was spoken largely by the white lower classes. Louisiana Creole, a creole that developed long before Haitian immigrants arrived in Louisiana, largely developed as the tongue of the Louisiana Creole community and a significant portion of self-identified Cajuns. However, linguists now believe that the Colonial and Acadian dialects have largely merged into modern Louisiana French but remain distinct from Louisiana Creole. French has gained co-official status with English in Louisiana, and there is both a thriving multi-generational base of speakers as well as a growing network of French immersion schools across the state in order to preserve the language. Louisiana also has a French-language society called CODOFIL (Conseil pour le d√©veloppement du fran√ßais en Louisiane). =Missouri= Missouri French is now spoken by a handful of people in the Midwestern United States, primarily in Missouri. It is the last remnant of the form of French once spoken widely in the region known as the Illinois Country, which was colonized as part of French Louisiana. It is considered very moribund, with only a few elderly speakers still fluent. =New England= New England French is the local name for Canadian French as it is spoken in New England, except in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine, where Acadian French predominates. Caribbean =Haiti= Haitian French is the variety of French spoken in Haiti. The main difference between Haitian French and the Metropolitan French is in the Haitian speaker's intonation, a rather subtle creole-based tone being used. Importantly, differences are not enough to cause problems between both speakers. Asia =Cambodian= Cambodian French is the French of Cambodia. It dates back to the French colonization of Indochina in 1863. Colonists taught French to the local inhabitants, especially the Khmer and Chinese. The locals also taught the colonists Khmer and some Chinese spoken variants, such as Teochew and Cantonese. Cambodian French was influenced by Khmer and Chinese spoken variants, and it was spoken by children of French men married to Khmer or ethnic Chinese women. Cambodian French is still used as a second language in some schools, universities and government offices, but most of the younger generations and members of the business world choose to learn English. Mostly, only older natives still speak French. Since the 1990s, there has been a small revival of French in Cambodia with French-language schools and centres opening. Many Cambodian students travel to France to receive studies as well as French-language media. Nevertheless, Cambodia still has the smallest Francophone population of the three French-speaking Asian countries, the others being Vietnam and Laos. =Indian French= Indian French is the French spoken by Indians in the former colonies of Pondich√©ry, Chandannagar, Karaikal, Mah√© and Yanam. There is a considerable influence from Dravidian languages like Tamil (Puducherry Tamil dialect), Telugu (Yanam Telugu dialect) and Malayalam (Mah√© Malayalam dialect). =Lao= Lao French is spoken in Laos. It goes back to the French colonization of Indochina despite a decline in the language after the country's independence and the communist takeover. A revival has now raised the number of students learning French to 35%. In addition, the Laotian √©lite and the elderly population speak French, which is the diplomatic language of Laos. =Vietnam= Vietnamese French is spoken in Vietnam, which has the largest Francophone population in Asia. Over 5% of the population learn the language or speak it well. French is also spoken among the elderly in Vietnam as a legacy of the colonial French era and also by the country's √©lite. A French pidgin, T√¢y B·ªìi, was spoken by Vietnamese servants in French households during the colonial era. Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the number of French-speakers in Vietnam and the number of students taking the language have declined, but French remains taught as an optional foreign language in higher education. Europe =Aostan= Aostan French (French: fran√ßais vald√¥tain) is the variety of French spoken in the Aosta Valley of Italy, where there is a significant trilingual francophone population. Some expressions, words and phrases are different from Standard French, some of them are similar to Swiss French and some reflecting the influence of Piedmontese language or Italian. Both French and Italian overlay the indigenous local language continuum of Aosta Valley, called Vald√¥tain (locally, patois), which is Franco-Proven√ßal in type. =Belgian= Belgian French (French: fran√ßais de Belgique) is the variety of French spoken mainly in the French Community of Belgium, alongside related minority regional languages such as Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Gaumais. Belgian French and the French of northern France are almost identical. Notable features include a strong distinction between long and short vowels, the lack of the approximant , and the use of certain Belgicisms. =Jersey Legal= Jersey Legal French is the official dialect of French used administratively in Jersey. Notable features include some archaic word choices and the words septante and nonante for \\"seventy\\" and \\"ninety\\" respectively. =Meridional= Meridional French (French: fran√ßais m√©ridional) is the regional variant of the French spoken in Occitania. It is strongly influenced by Occitan. =Swiss= Swiss French () is the variety of French spoken in the French-speaking area of Switzerland known as Romandy. The differences between Swiss French and Parisian French are minor and mostly lexical.

Witte Study-Community\\", Lecture \\"The Hamburg School (The early years)\\" by Michael Feist, p. 12 Early collaborators of Alfred Witte were Friedrich Sieggr√ºn and Ludwig Rudolph. In his search for Pluto, Witte claimed four planets beyond Pluto, and Sieggr√ºn claimed yet another four. These bodies are in the Transneptunian regions, where many planetary discoveries are being validated today. These astrologically derived transneptunian factors have as of 2009 neither been proven nor disproven to be among what astronomers have generically labeled Transneptunians, or Kuiper Belt, Scattered Disk Objects, or Oort Cloud phenomena, as further research on this region remains to be done. Witte promoted the use of the transneptunian hypothetical planets, meaning none of the Witte transneptunian planets were astronomically verifiable at the time in which he discovered them nor have they been verified by astronomers at any time since he proposed their existence. Witte's transneptunian planets were, Cupido, Hades, Zeus and Kronos. In 1927, Sieggr√ºn expanded the list of transneptunian hypothetical planets to include Apollon, Admetos, Vulkanus and Poseidon (1934), beyond what Witte himself perceived to exist. In the 1930s the American Richard Svehla became official advocate of ‚ÄúHamburg School‚Äù and created the term ‚ÄúUranian Astrology‚Äù for the US in 1936.‚ÄúThe New German Astrology (Hamburg School)‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe New Uranian Astrology,‚Äù lectures by Svehla at the All-American ¬ªAstrological Convention¬´ in Chicago, 1936.\\"Preface of reprint\\" \\"Rulesbook for Planetary Pictures by A.Witte & L.Rudolph\\", p. 10, Reprint of the first English translation 1939. Witte-Verlag Publishing, Hamburg, 2014 Ludwig Rudolph printed and published Witte's findings, the core of which were published in the Rulesbook for Planetary Pictures (Regelwerk f√ºr Planetenbilder) in 1928. An increasing amount of the research of the Hamburg School revolved around work with astrological midpoints and use of the extra planets. Unfortunately, Witte and Rudolph were pursued by the Gestapo as enemies of the Third Reich. Alfred Witte committed suicide before being sent to a concentration camp, and Ludwig Rudolph was indeed interned, the Rulebook for Planetary Pictures banned and burned by the Nazis. Reinhold Ebertin, a (unofficial) student of Hamburg School methods, eliminated the use of the hypothetical trans-neptunian objects while maintaining the core teachings of the Hamburg School, renamed them \\"Cosmobiology\\" (), and published them in The Combination of Stellar Influences in 1940, last updated in English in 1972.

The Hamburg School astrologer Hermann Lefeldt combined Witte's theories with more astrological traditions such as the use of astrological houses. However, other Hamburg practitioners maintained their focus on working only with astrological midpoints , abandoning traditional practices, including the 12 houses and rulerships.

He is the Dean of the Cambridge Muslim College, Aziz Foundation Professor of Islamic Studies at both Cambridge Muslim College and Ebrahim College, Director of Studies (Theology and Religious Studies) at Wolfson College and the Shaykh Zayed Lecturer in Islamic Studies at University of Cambridge.Dr Timothy Winter, Faculty of Divinity, University of Cambridge: People.Wolfson College. His work includes publications on Islamic theology and Muslim-Christian relations.. In 2003 he was awarded the Pilkington Teaching Prize by Cambridge University and in 2007 he was awarded the King Abdullah I Prize for Islamic Thought for his short booklet Bombing Without Moonlight. He has consistently been included in The 500 Most Influential Muslims list published annually by the Royal Aal al- Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought and was ranked in 2012 as the 50th most influential. Most recently in the 2020 Edition of The 500 Most Influential Muslims, Winter was ranked the 48th most influential Muslim in the world. Background and education Winter is the son of an architect and artist. Winter was educated at Westminster School and graduated with a double-first in Arabic from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1983. He then went on to study at Al Azhar University in Cairo and further private study with individual scholars in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. After returning to England, he studied Turkish and Persian at the University of London. Major work and projects In 2009 Winter helped to open the Cambridge Muslim College, an institute designed to train British imams.Muslim Integration College. Winter also directs the Anglo-Muslim Fellowship for Eastern Europe, and the Sunna Project which has published the foremost scholarly Arabic editions of the major Sunni Hadith collections. He serves as the secretary of the Muslim Academic Trust. Winter is active in translating key Islamic texts into English including a translation of two volumes of the Islamic scholar al-Ghazali's Ihya Ulum al- Din. His academic publications include many articles on Islamic theology and Muslim-Christian relations as well as two books in Turkish on political theology. His book reviews sometimes appear in the Times Literary Supplement. He is also the editor of the Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology (2008) and author of Bombing without Moonlight, which in 2007 was awarded the King Abdullah I Prize for Islamic Thought. Winter is also a contributor to BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day. Additionally, Winter is one of the signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding. =Cambridge Mosque Project= Winter is the founder and leader of the Cambridge Central Mosque project which is working to develop a new purpose built mosque in Cambridge to cater for up to 1,000 worshipers. The mosque is planned to be entirely reliant on green energy with an almost-zero carbon footprint. Regarding the project, Winter stated, \\"This will be a very substantial world class landmark building in what is considered by some to be a down-at-heel part of Cambridge.\\" Views on extremism Winter is a traditionalist and considers the views of extremists like al-Qaeda as religiously illegitimate and inauthentic. He decries the failure of extremists to adhere to the classical canons of Islamic law and theology and denounces their fatwas. He unequivocally rejects suicide bombing and considers the killing of noncombatants as always forbidden, noting that some sources consider it worse than murder. According to Winter, Osama bin Laden and his right-hand man Ayman al-Zawahiri are un-Islamic, unqualified vigilantes who violate basic Islamic teachings. Winter is critical of Western foreign policy for fueling anger and resentment in the Muslim world. He is equally critical of Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi ideology, which he believes gives extremists a theological pretext for their extremism and violence. Personal life Winter's younger brother is football writer Henry Winter. Awards and nominations In January 2015, Winter was nominated for the Services to Education award at the British Muslim Awards.

Playing most of his footballing career for West Ham United he appeared in 598 games for them, scoring 34 goals. With the club for 21 years, and winning the 1980 FA Cup Martin left West Ham in 1996 and played one season with Leyton Orient before moving into football management with Southend United. This lasted two seasons before he started a career in the media on radio station talkSPORT and also as a pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows. Playing 17 times for England during the 1980s, Martin represented them at the 1986 World Cup. Club career Born in Walton, Liverpool, Lancashire, Martin played schools football for Bootle and Lancashire and was attached to Merseyside club Everton as a schoolboy, but left in 1974 after the Goodison Park club only offered him an apprenticeship on a part-time basis. An unsuccessful trial later that summer with Queens Park Rangers was followed the very next day by one for West Ham United, where he was awarded a contract as an apprentice 19 August 1974.West Ham handbooks 1986-87 and 1988/90 He appeared in the FA Youth cup final of 1975 and signed as a professional on 29 July 1976. He did not make his first team debut until 18 March 1978 as a substitute against Aston Villa. His final appearance was as an 88th-minute substitute on 5 May 1996 against Sheffield Wednesday. Martin went on to amass nearly 600 first-team appearances for the Hammers in a successful 19-year professional career at Upton Park, in which he became one of only two players, along with Billy Bonds, to be awarded two testimonials. The first was against Spurs on 21 August 1988 and the second against Chelsea on 11 November 1995.Handbooks 1988/89 and 1996/97 It was alongside Bonds in the centre of defence that Martin ‚Äì nicknamed 'Stretch' ‚Äì enjoyed his most rewarding years, winning the FA Cup and Second Division winners medals in successive seasons, 1980 and 1981. Martin also achieved the rare feat of scoring a hat-trick against three different Newcastle United goalkeepers ‚Äì Martin Thomas, who was then injured, and outfield players Chris Hedworth and Peter Beardsley ‚Äì in a Football League First Division match in April 1986 which the Hammers won 8‚Äì1. This was among the most successful seasons the club ever saw, as it finished third in the top level, just four points behind champions Liverpool, with the player contributing with 40 games and four goals. Martin remained loyal to West Ham despite their relegation from the top flight in 1989, and helped them gain promotion two years later. The club lasted just one season before again dropping down a level, only to bounce back at the first attempt. Martin, for decades the club's longest serving player, spent three more years with the team in the Premier League before finally departing at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season after 21 years service, aged 37.Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Alvin Martin After leaving West Ham, Martin had a brief spell with East London neighbours Leyton Orient, before managing Southend United for two years, during which the club was relegated to the League One. International career Martin was given his first England cap by Ron Greenwood against Brazil at Wembley in May 1981. Injury ruled him out of the 1982 FIFA World Cup finals in Spain, but he was playing some of the finest football of his career when the next manager, Bobby Robson, included him in his squad for the 1986 edition in Mexico: he played in the victory over Paraguay, replacing the suspended Terry Fenwick, but was dropped for the next game, the quarter-final defeat by Argentina's infamous 'Hand of God'; in total, he made 17 international appearances. Career after football After retiring from management, he joined national radio station talkSPORT, while also being a regular pundit on Sky Sports TV football talk shows.

It was produced by Big Finish Productions for BBCi, which was then the interactive television service arm of the BBC, and was originally webcast on the BBC Doctor Who website from 2 August ‚Äì 6 September 2002. Real Time, along with the other Doctor Who webcast animations, Shada and Death Comes To Time, has been uploaded to YouTube. Synopsis There has been a series of mysterious vanishings on the desert planet Chronos in the 33rd century. Survey teams working for a university seem to have simply vanished amongst the pyramids on the planet. Alongside two other survey teams and an expert on cybernetics, the Doctor and Evelyn learn the deadly truth: that the planet Chronos is being used as a base for one of the Doctor's oldest and deadliest foes  the Cybermen.

This webcast would involve Colin Baker playing the Sixth Doctor accompanied by Maggie Stables as Dr Evelyn Smythe, his companion in the Big Finish audio plays. The limited bandwidth allowed by broadcasting across the Internet meant that writer and director Gary Russell approached the story with the edict that it would be shorter than many of the Big Finish plays. He decided that the story would therefore run, more or less, in \\"real time\\", with its complete 60-minute running time being exactly how long the Doctor would be involved within the story. The webcast was accompanied by very limited animation based on illustrations by artist Lee Sullivan. The storyline was left without a definitive conclusion, allowing for a possible sequel to be made at a future date. However, the following webcast was a remake of the uncompleted 1979 serial Shada, written by Douglas Adams. When BBCi decided to take the production of the next webcast, Scream of the Shalka, completely in-house, this led to a brief falling out between Big Finish and BBCi, and any plans for a sequel to Real Time were shelved at that point. This extended to Russell even suggesting that Real Time be considered non-canon as far as the audio plays were concerned. An extended version was released on CD in December 2002 by Big Finish, minus the illustrations/animation that had been included in the webcast but with the addition of further scenes designed to help the plot along, including an opening scene set inside the TARDIS. Merchandise Character Options released a special figure of the Sixth Doctor in his \\"toned down\\" blue suit as part of its Doctor Who Classic 5\\" action figure series. A second action figure of the Sixth Doctor in his blue outfit was released in 2016, as part of a set including all 13 incarnations of the Doctor. This version is far more detailed than the first, featuring multiple shades of blue.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, lack of an audible release is denoted with an upper-right corner diacritic () after the consonant letter: , , .The diacritic may not display properly with some fonts, appearing above the consonant rather than after it; in such cases, , , may be used instead. Audibly released stops, on the other hand, are not normally indicated. If a final stop is aspirated, the aspiration diacritic is sufficient to indicate the release. Otherwise, the \\"unaspirated\\" diacritic of the Extended IPA may be employed for this: apt . English In most dialects of English, the first stop of a cluster has no audible release, as in apt , doctor , or logged on . Although such sounds are frequently described as \\"unreleased\\", the reality is that since the two consonants overlap, the release of the former takes place during the hold of the latter, masking the former's release and making it inaudible. That can lead to cross-articulations that seem very much like deletions or complete assimilation. For example, hundred pounds may sound like but X-ray and electropalatographic studies demonstrate that since inaudible and possibly-weakened contacts may still be made, the second in hundred pounds does not entirely assimilate a labial place of articulation but co-occurs with it. In American English, a stop in syllable-final position is typically realized as an unreleased stop; that is especially the case for /t/,Odden, David (2005). Introduction to Phonology. Page 32., but in that position, it is also analyzed as experiencing glottal reinforcement. Such sounds may occur between vowels, as in some pronunciations of out a lot. The overlap there appears to be with a glottal stop, : the is pronounced, and since it is between vowels, it must be released. However, its release is masked by the glottal stop.'no (audible) release', John Wells's phonetic blog, 2012 March 14. (See: T-glottalization, in some dialects). The term \\"unreleased\\" is also used for a stop before a homorganic nasal, as in catnip. In such cases, however, the stop is released as a nasal in a nasal release and so it would be more precisely transcribed . Other languages In most languages in East and Southeast Asia with final stops, such as Cantonese, Hokkien, Korean, Malay, Thai, and West Coast Bajau, the stops are not audibly released: mak . That is true even between vowels. That is thought to be caused by an overlapping glottal stop and is more precisely transcribed . A consequence of an inaudible release is that any aspirated‚Äìunaspirated distinction is neutralized. Some languages, such as Vietnamese, which are reported to have unreleased final stops, turn out to have short voiceless nasal releases instead. The excess pressure is released (voicelessly) through the nose and so there is no audible release to the stop. =Formosan languages= The Formosan languages of Taiwan, such as Tsou and Amis, are unusual in that all obstruents are released but not aspirated, as in Tsou \\"four\\" and \\"to pierce\\", or Amis \\"one\\" and \\"four\\". (The symbol for a release burst, , is acknowledged but not supported by the IPA.) =Gyalrong languages= In Gyalrongic languages, plosives and nasal stops could be unreleased after a glottal stop,Page 27, A Grammar of RGyalrong, Ji«éom√πz√∫ (Kyom-kyo) Dialects: A Web of Relations Marielle Prins 2016, 9789004324565 for example: * > * > =Pirah√£= In Pirah√£, the only surviving dialect of the Mura language, there is a special register of speech using solely humming, which doesn't involve an audible release and may be transcribed as of different length and tone.

Unity Tower is located near the Mogilskie Roundabout (Rondo Mogilskie) and Cracow University of Economics. It is the second tallest building in Krak√≥w after K1 and excluding antennas. The building is still under construction.  History  Originally, it was intended to become the regional office of the Main Technical Organization (Naczelna Organizacja Techniczna, NOT) and be named the NOT Tower. The construction of the building was started in 1975, but stopped permanently in 1981 because of economic constraints and political unrest associated with the imposition of martial law in Poland in that year. Due to the unfinished building's resemblance to a skeleton, it was nicknamed after Skeletor, the arch-villain in He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which was popular in Poland at the time construction began. Investors have expressed interest in renovating the building, but they have been discouraged by the complicated legal status of the land on which it stands and the high cost of its demolition or adaptation. In 2007, a new plan for the building was put forward, which postulated to increase its height from 92 to as high as 130 meters. German architect Hans Kollhoff was invited to take part in the reconstruction of the building, which was supposed to be completed by the time of UEFA Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. However, the project was rejected by the Provincial Conservation Council on the grounds that the new building was located within a historical urban landscape. The building was partially owned by TreiMorfa Project. The long debate about its possible future use based on brand new plans was cut short by the courts in December 2011 because of legal improprieties by its new design team.Szkieletor: Decyzja o warunkach zabudowy uchylona!

The exterior architecture is inspired by the Art Deco architecture of the 1920s and 30s. The use of grey stone and the architecture is partially inspired by the Maccabees Building.http://unitycentre.pl/en/history/# In 2018, before the full reconstruction of the building was completed, the ArchDaily architecture website, named Szkieletor as one of \\"History's Most Notorious Unfinished Buildings\\" alongside the Palace of the Soviets, Siena Cathedral and Ryugyong Hotel.

His primary position was as a right-back, though he was also able to play in central defence. Club career =Paris Saint-Germain= Beye joined Paris Saint-Germain in 1997, though he progressed no further than the reserve side, playing in the national fifth division. He transferred at the end of the season to RC Strasbourg in 1998 for an undisclosed amount. =RC Strasbourg= Following his summer move to RC Strasbourg in 1998, Beye made his league debut on 8 August 1998 in a home 0‚Äì0 draw against Olympique Lyonnais, and played a total of 23 times in his first season at the club. He missed just five league matches in the following season, and netted for the first time on 2 October 1999 in a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Bordeaux. He was a member of the RC Strasbourg side that won the 2001 French Cup, eventually defeating third division Amiens SC in a penalty shoot-out, which helped his team achieve UEFA Cup qualification in the following season. He appeared a total of 134 times in the league for Strasbourg, scoring 8 goals, before moving to Olympique Marseille in 2003, a move which surprised many as he was a firm favourite at Strasbourg and had established himself as a key player there. =Olympique Marseille= Beye signed for Olympique Marseille in the summer of 2003 for a reported ‚Ç¨2.5million, by then manager Alain Perrin. In his opening season with the club, he took part in both UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup football. He was a key player for the Marseille side that reached the 2004 UEFA Cup Final, a run which involved him putting in a star performance as a central defender against (his now former team) Newcastle United, where he was particularly effective against Newcastle's talisman striker Alan Shearer. He ended up on the losing side as Marseille lost the final to Valencia 2‚Äì0. He was also a beaten finalist in the 2006 French Cup against former club Paris Saint-Germain, a match which his team lost 2‚Äì1, and again in 2007 when his Marseille team lost on penalties to FC Sochaux. His time with Marseille was a successful one where he established himself as one of the most accomplished defenders in France's top tier and was voted the fans‚Äô Player of the Year in 2006. He was captain of the club for two years prior to his move to Newcastle United. =Newcastle United= Beye signed for Newcastle United for a fee of ¬£2million (‚Ç¨3million) on 31 August 2007, during the closing minutes of the summer transfer window. He signed a three-year contract, with then Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce declaring that he was very pleased with the transfer. Allardyce said in a later interview on the club's website that he felt he acquired Beye for a \\"bargain\\" price and that him and his international colleague who also signed with him, Abdoulaye Faye would be excellent signings for Newcastle. He made his Newcastle debut on 17 September 2007, as a substitute in Newcastle's 1‚Äì0 defeat at Derby County. He then made his full debut at home to West Ham United, a display which impressed many Newcastle fans. He had been a fixture in the first team, and scored his only Premier League goal for Newcastle in the 2‚Äì1 win against Birmingham City on 8 December, with a near-post header in second-half injury time. His ability to defend well and provide a good outlet going forward have enamored him to the Newcastle faithful and a number of terrace songs became established, starting with a chant of his name to the tune of Happy Days first heard at Fulham. His status as a cult hero was cemented by the creation of the tongue-in-cheek fan site Beyewatch. On 22 May 2008, Beye was named Newcastle player of the season based on fan votes to a poll organised by the Evening Chronicle,Beye tops Toon fans' end of season poll www.chroniclelive.co.uk, 22 May 2008 he was then named the official Newcastle player of the season on 23 May 2008, as well as being named the Newcastle United Disabled Supporters Association Player of the Season on 22 August. After missing the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season from injury, Beye started against Manchester City on 20 October 2008. He was sent off after only 12 minutes for a challenge on Robinho, the first red card of his Newcastle career. Newcastle appealed the red card and on 23 October the claim of wrongful dismissal was upheld. After Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League at the conclusion of the 2008‚Äì09 season, an article on the club's official website stated Beye's intention to remain at the club to help get them back into the Premier League. However, the continuing problems behind the scenes at Newcastle would lead to Beye stating that he would have to leave the club in order to save his career. =Aston Villa= Despite Hull City chairman Paul Duffen revealing that the Tigers had agreed a fee with Newcastle United to sign Beye on 6 August 2009, it was announced the following day that Beye had signed for Aston Villa.WEBFLASH: Beye Signs. avfc.co.uk. Retrieved 10 April 2014. Beye was substituted late into his Villa debut on the opening day of the 2009‚Äì10 season, a 2‚Äì0 defeat by Wigan Athletic. He was sent off near the end of his third game for Villa in an away tie against West Ham United. Beye found it hard to break into the Villa first team with the likes of Carlos Cu√©llar and Luke Young ahead of him in the pecking order and often found himself restricted to bench appearances. In February 2012, it was announced that Beye's contract had been cancelled by mutual consent.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston- villa-habib-beye-leaves-178331 =Doncaster Rovers= After making just 9 league appearances for Aston Villa since the summer of 2009 and being surplus to requirements, Beye signed on loan for Doncaster Rovers in November 2011, in a hope to revive his career after a turbulent two years spell in Aston Villa. After his first 3 games for the club, he received big praise from Rovers fans and Rovers manager Dean Saunders following some impressive displays in the centre of defence. He helped Doncaster to two home clean sheets in a row, whilst winning the sponsors man of the match award in both games (against Watford and Southampton) and has been a regular starter in the team. On 22 January 2012, Beye was sent off during a match against Bristol City in a Championship game which ended in a 2‚Äì1 defeat, resulting in a three-match ban. This also turned out to be his last game for Doncaster as he was released by Aston Villa on 2 February. Following his release, Beye signed an 18-month deal to permanently join Rovers on 13 February 2012. After completing his domestic three-game ban, he played his first game after signing permanently against Peterborough United in a 1‚Äì1 draw on 25 February 2012. He scored his first goal for the club against fellow relegation candidates Portsmouth on 14 April. At the same time, he was sent off for the second time this season for a foul on Portsmouth's Dave Kitson, which conceded a penalty for the opposing side. That result ended 4‚Äì3 in favour of Portsmouth and Birmingham City's 2‚Äì2 draw against Bristol City confirmed Doncaster's relegation to the League One for the upcoming 2012‚Äì13 season. Hhe returned from suspension on 28 April, and scored a late consolation goal for Doncaster Rovers, in a 3‚Äì2 defeat by Ipswich Town on the final day of the season. Beye retired from football after his contract ended. International career Beye has been a regular in the Senegal national squad since 2001, and has 35 caps and one goal. He made substitute appearances in Senegal's matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, against Denmark, Uruguay and Sweden. He retired from international football in an effort to concentrate on his club career following a shambolic Africa Cup of Nations by Senegal in 2008, though he was then called up for a friendly against Libya on 20 August 2008, meaning that he had either not retired or chosen to come out of it.

The term also refers to the first adhesive postage stamps in Asia, George Burrow, \\"The Stamps of the Scinde District Dawk\\", American Journal of Philately, National Philatelical Society of New York, Staten Island Philatelic Society, and the Brooklyn Philatelic Club, vol. 3 (1890), pp. 383‚Äì6; at p. 384. the forerunners of the adhesive stamps used throughout India, Burma, the Straits Settlements and other areas controlled by the British East India Company. First Issues Collectors Club (retrieved 25 September) The name derives from the words \\"Scinde\\", the British spelling of the name of the province of Sindh, and \\"Dawk\\", the anglicised spelling of the Hindustani word \\"Dak\\" or Post. Origins The Dawk, or Dak, was a very old postal system of runners. The runners were paid according to their distance of travel and the weight of their letters. This was a local Indus Valley system, inefficient and inadequate for the military and commercial needs of the British East India Company after their conquest of Sindh in February, 1843, following the Battle of Miani. Reform of the postal system Sir Bartle Frere of the East India Company became the Chief Commissioner of Sindh in 1850. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, New American Supplement, XXVII, p. 39 (1907) Following the English example set by Rowland Hill, Frere improved upon the postal system of Sindh by introducing a cheap and uniform rate for postage, independent of distance travelled. In 1851 the runners were replaced with an efficient system using horses and camels, following routes through Scinde province, generally along the valley of the Indus river. The mail was carried quickly and efficiently, connecting government offices and post offices from Karachi through Kotri and Hyderabad up to Sukkur in the north. The stamps The stamps were embossed Stamps were required for the prepayment of postage, a basic feature of the new system. These stamps, first issued on 1 July 1852,Robson Lowe, Encyclopedia of British Empire Postage Stamps, v. III London, Robson Lowe, Ltd. (1951), pp. 150‚Äì151. bore the Merchants' Mark of the British East India Company Scinde District Dawks - The Premier Stamps of Asia in a design embossed on wafers of red sealing wax impressed on paper. Because they cracked and disintegrated, they were soon replaced by a colourless design embossed on white paper which was hard to see in a dim light. The last stamps were a blue embossing on white paper. Postal history of India (retrieved 24 September 2006) All of these had a value of only one-half anna each, but today they rank among the rare classics of philately. Celebrating 150 years of the Indian Postal Services (retrieved 24 September) Forgeries Forgeries of these rare stamps are plentiful. The most easily detected fakes are not embossed on paper. Other crude fakes show a misalignment of the second letter 'A' of ANNA with the 'K' of DAWK; and in other fakes the '1/2' is not separated from the central heartshaped emblem. Later developments After the Scinde Dawk, Colonel Forbes of the Calcutta Mint came up with an essay for a postage stamp depicting a lion and palm tree. This, and several other essays, were never printed because Forbes could not ensure an adequate supply with the limited machinery at hand. Postal history of India (retrieved 25 September 2006) Soon after, new, lithographed stamps printed by the Survey Office appeared in several denominations valid for use throughout British India as part of sweeping postal reforms. First Issues Collectors Club (Retrieved 25 September 2006) The British East India Company's posts are important, because the \\"Great Company\\" held sway over so much of the world's commerce in those days, extending across Asia and East Africa. It had its own armies, coinage, and postal service; constructed railways and public works; and acted like an imperial force long before the Empire was established.

The film title was taken from Whiteman's self-conferred appellation. At the time the film was made, \\"jazz\\", to the general public, meant the jazz-influenced syncopated dance music which was being heard everywhere on phonograph records and through radio broadcasts. In the 1920s Whiteman signed and featured white jazz musicians including Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang (both are seen and heard in the film), Bix Beiderbecke (who had left before filming began), Frank Trumbauer and others. King of Jazz was filmed entirely in the early two-color Technicolor process and was produced by Carl Laemmle Jr. for Universal Pictures. The film featured several songs sung on camera by the Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Al Rinker and Harry Barris), as well as off-camera solo vocals by Crosby during the opening credits and, very briefly, during a cartoon sequence. King of Jazz still survives in a near- complete color print and is not a lost film, unlike many contemporary musicals that now exist only either in incomplete form or as black-and-white reduction copies. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot King of Jazz is a revue. There is zero story, only a series of musical numbers alternating with \\"blackouts\\" (very brief comedy sketches with abrupt punch line endings) and other short introductory or linking segments. The musical numbers are diverse in character, taking a \\"something for everyone\\" approach to appeal to family audiences by catering to the young, the old and the middle-aged in turn. The slow Bridal Veil number, featuring (according to Universal) the largest veil ever made, exhibits Victorian sentimentality that might best appeal to the elderly. The middle-aged were courted with a tune by John Boles in a lush setting crooning It Happened in Monterey in waltz time, or in a barn with a chorus of red-shirted ranch hands belting out the Song of the Dawn. The \\"jazzy\\" Happy Feet number was designed to appeal to younger audiences. One segment early in the film serves to introduce several of the band's virtuoso musicians (yet those musicians are not credited by name). Another provides the audience with a chance to see the Rhythm Boys, already famous by sound but not sight because of their recordings and radio broadcasts, performing in a home- like setting. There are novelty and comedy numbers ranging from the mildly risqu√© (Ragamuffin Romeo, which features contortionistic dancing by Marion Stadler and Don Rose) to the humorously sadomasochistic (the second chorus of I Like to Do Things for You) to the simply silly (I'm a Fisherman). There is a line of chorus girls, practically mandatory in early musicals, but in their featured spot the novelty is that they are seated. The grand finale is the Melting Pot of Music production number, in which various immigrant groups in national costume offer brief renditions of characteristic songs from their native lands, after which they are all consigned to the American Melting Pot. Performers from some of the earlier musical numbers briefly reprise their acts while reporting for duty as fuel under the pot. Whiteman stirs the steaming stew. When the cooking is complete, everyone emerges transformed into a jazz- happy American. There are a couple of early examples of the overhead views later elaborated and made famous by Busby Berkeley, but this film bears little resemblance to his films and other musicals of the later 1930s. It is very much a stage presentation, albeit on a very large stage, and visual interest is maintained only by changes of viewpoint. The cameras do not move. This is not because the Technicolor cameras were heavy and bulky. The cameras used for this early Technicolor process contained a single roll of film and were of nearly ordinary size and weight. King of Jazz was the nineteenth all-talking motion picture filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor rather than simply including color sequences. At the time, Technicolor's two-color process employed red and green dyes, each with a dash of other colors mixed in, but no blue dye. King of Jazz was to showcase a spectacular presentation of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, so this presented a problem. Fortunately, the green dye Technicolor used can actually appear peacock blue (cyan) under some conditions,Friedman, J: History of Color Photography, The American Photographic Publishing Company, Boston, second printing, 1945. Friedman, who joined the Technicolor Corporation in 1929, specifies (on page 480) Pontacyl green with a small admixture of Metanil yellow for the green dye bath in a two-color process, but also prescribes (on page 481) Pontacyl green in combination with Fast acid green for the cyan dye bath in a three-color process. Many synthetic dyes have dichroic characteristics and can appear as strikingly different colors in different concentrations. Various artificial light sources can also have a significant impact on their appearance. but acceptable results in this case would require very careful handling. Art director Herman Rosse and production director John Murray Anderson came up with solutions. Tests were made of various fabrics and pigments, and by using an all gray-and-silver background the bluish aspect of the dye was set off to best advantage. Filters were also used to inject pale blues into the scene being filmed. The goal was to produce a finished film with pastel shades rather than bright colors. Nevertheless, as it appears in an original two- color Technicolor print, the sequence might best be described as a \\"Rhapsody in Turquoise\\". Later prints made from the original two-component negative, which had survived, make the blues look truer and more saturated than they appeared to audiences in 1930. King of Jazz marked the first film appearance of the popular crooner Bing Crosby,Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation page 11 who, at the time, was a member of The Rhythm Boys, the Whiteman Orchestra's vocal trio. Crosby was scheduled to sing \\"Song of the Dawn\\" in the film but a motor accident led to him being jailed for a time and the song was given to John Boles. Composer Ferde Grof√©, best known for his Grand Canyon Suite, was, in these early years, a well known arranger/songwriter for Whiteman. He is documented to have arranged some of the music, and may in fact have composed some of the incidental music. The film preserves a vaudeville bit by Whiteman band trombonist Wilbur Hall, who does novelty playing on violin and bicycle pump, as well as the eccentric dancing of \\"Rubber Legs\\" Al Norman to the tune of Happy Feet. There were at least nine different foreign language versions of the film. Reportedly, the Swedish version has at least some different music. The cartoon The film included the first Technicolor animated cartoon segment, by animators Walter Lantz (later famous for Woody Woodpecker and other characters) and William Nolan. In this cartoon, Whiteman is hunting \\"in darkest Africa\\", where he is chased by a lion which he soothes by playing a tune on a violin (Music Hath Charms, played by Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang). After an elephant squirts water on a monkey in a tree, the monkey throws a coconut at the elephant. It misses and hits Whiteman on the head. The bump on his head forms into a crown. Master of Ceremonies Charles Irwin then remarks, \\"And that's how Paul Whiteman was crowned the King of Jazz.\\" One of the characters making a brief appearance in the cartoon is Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the star of the Universal Studios animation department led by Lantz. A black-and-white sound cartoon featuring Oswald, titled My Pal Paul, also released in 1930 by Universal, promoted King of Jazz by including songs from the film and a cartoon Paul Whiteman character. Some of the scenes from the animated cartoon sequence would be later re-used for a later Walter Lantz Oswald Cartoon, Africa. Soundtrack King of Jazz was the first feature- length film to use a mostly pre-recorded soundtrack made independently of the actual filming. Whiteman insisted that musical numbers featuring his orchestra should be pre-recorded in order to obtain the best sound, avoiding the poor recording conditions and extraneous noises typical of a movie studio sound stage. Universal opposed the idea, but Whiteman prevailed over the reluctant studio executives. After the sound was recorded, it was played back through a loudspeaker while the scene was being filmed and the performers matched their actions to the recording. Later, the resulting film was synchronized with the soundtrack. This also allowed the scene to be shot in the same manner as a silent film, with the director free to shout out instructions during the filming and the camera unrestricted by any need to silence its noises with bulky soundproofing. Delbert Cobain, one of the singers in the film, is notable as being the great-uncle of musician Kurt Cobain (the late vocalist and guitarist of Nirvana). The Rhythm Boys The Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris, and Al Rinker) sang Mississippi Mud, So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together, I'm a Fisherman, A Bench in the Park, and Happy Feet in the film. This singing trio also recorded as part of Whiteman's band and on their own with Barris on piano. Crosby also sang Music Hath Charms over the title credits and provided the singing voice for Whiteman in the animated cartoon singing My Lord Deliver Daniel. Bing Crosby went on several benders during the filming, crashed his car on Hollywood Boulevard, sent to jail for 60 days for talking back and wise-cracking to a judge. Whiteman replaced him with John Boles for \\"The Song Of The Dawn\\".

It featured the Rhapsody in Blue and Mildred Bailey backed by the Roxy Chorus and was performed five times a day, between showings of the film, for a week. The film continued to play at the Roxy for only one additional week. As originally released, the film was 105 minutes long. The 1933 reissue was 65 minutes. Several entire sequences and numbers were removed for the reissue, while others were trimmed of just a few shots. One cut for the 1933 re-release was a sketch with William Kent about a suicidal flute player, with the Whiteman Orchestra performing Caprice Viennois as background music. The 2016 restoration runs 98 minutes with two minutes of playout music. Some sections were cut before the film's 1930 release and never seen by the general public. They include: *A specialty number featuring Nell O'Day, with unknown music, set in a cabaret lobby. *A segment featuring Grace Hayes singing My Lover. A 93-minute version, cobbled together from the 65 minute negative and a 16mm print was used for the videocassette release of the film in 1983. Prints of the original uncut version still survive. The Criterion Collection had released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2018. The Blu-ray version has a 4K restoration of the film and includes both the original film and two Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons as well as both 1929 stage version and 1933 short featuring Whiteman and his band. Reception Theatrical release window card poster Universal expected this revue to repeat or surpass the box-office performance of a musical entitled Broadway which it had released in 1929. That lavish film had included Technicolor sequences and had been a success. Unfortunately, delays in beginning the filming of King of Jazz caused its release to occur after two unforeseen developments. First, the public had tired of the flood of movie musicals that began as a slow trickle with The Jazz Singer in late 1927 and rapidly became a torrent after the success of The Broadway Melody in early 1929. In particular disfavor were operettas set in bygone eras, musical comedies which were unimaginatively filmed Broadway stage productions, and plotless \\"revues\\" such as King of Jazz. Second, although the ripple effects from the stock market crash in October 1929 had not yet produced the full-blown depression which would soon be painfully obvious, people were already spending less freely and the effects were starting to be felt at the box office. During its national release, King of Jazz cleared less than $900,000. Around Hollywood, the movie came to be called \\"Universal's Rhapsody in the Red\\". Because of poor box-office receipts for the film and the cancellation of his lucrative nationally broadcast radio program by its sponsor in April 1930, Whiteman had to let ten band members go and cut the salaries of the remaining band members by fifteen percent. The film received mixed reviews. A reviewer for The New Movie called it a lavish, over-produced \\"disappointment\\"; an overlong, \\"dull m√©lange\\" whose only effective performers were Whiteman and John Boles. In contrast, the New York Times asserted that \\"John Murray Anderson's initial contribution to the audible screen, 'King of Jazz,' with the rotund Paul Whiteman, reveals this director to be a magician of far greater powers than one imagined, even from his stage compositions. This Technicolor potpourri of songs, dancing and fun is a marvel of camera wizardry, joyous color schemes, charming costumes and seductive lighting effects.\\" The reviewer, Mordaunt Hall, further praised the film for having \\"nothing imitative,\\" added that \\"Mr. Anderson has visualized the full possibilities of the camera in connection with his flights of fancy,\\" and concluded \\"there is no sequence that isn't worth witnessing and no performance that is not capable in this fastpaced picture.\\" Overseas, where there was never a backlash against musicals, it fared better and eventually made a profit. During the 1930s, the film found its best audience in Cape Town, South Africa, where it played seventeen return engagements. The film won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Herman Rosse. Other films nominated in this category were Bulldog Drummond, The Love Parade, Sally and The Vagabond King. In 2016 the film was included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry after a significant restoration in 2013.

The term was first used in the semantic literature by Marc Moens and Mark Steedman, who adopted it on \\"loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages\\". In the framework of the generative lexicon (a formal compositional approach to lexical semantics), Pustejovsky (1995:111) defines coercion as \\"a semantic operation that converts an argument to the type which is expected by a function, where it would otherwise result in a type error.\\" \\"Coercion\\" in the Pustejovsky framework includes complement coercion and aspectual coercion. An example of complement coercion is the sentence \\"I began the book\\", where the predicate \\"began\\" is assumed to be a selector which requires its complement to denote an event, but \\"a book\\" denotes an entity, not an event. So, on the coercion analysis, \\"begin\\" coerces \\"a book\\" from an entity to an event involving that entity, allowing the sentence to be interpreted to mean, e.g., \\"I began to read a book,\\" or \\"I began to write a book.\\" An example of aspectual coercion involving temporal connectives is \\"Let's leave after dessert\\" (Pustejovsky 1995:230). Another example of aspectual coercion from psycholinguistics research includes sentences such as \\"The tiger jumped for an hour,\\" where the prepositional phrase \\"for an hour\\" coerces the lexical meaning of \\"jump\\" to be iterative across the entire duration. Coercion is closely related to the notions of active zone, construal/conceptualization, and syntactic accommodation known from various schools within the cognitive linguistics movement.

Directed by George Cukor, it was notorious as one of the most famous unsuccessful movies of the 1930s. Hepburn plays the title role of Sylvia Scarlett, a female con artist masquerading as a boy to escape the police. The success of the subterfuge is in large part due to the transformation of Hepburn by RKO makeup artist Mel Berns. This film was the first pairing of Grant and Hepburn, who later starred together in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Holiday (1938), and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Grant's performance as a dashing rogue sees him incorporate a Cockney accent and remains widely considered the first time Grant's famous personality began to register on film. (Grant used the Cockney accent in only a few other films, notably 1939's Gunga Din and Clifford Odets' None but the Lonely Heart in 1944.) Cockney was not, however, Cary Grant's original accent. He was born and grew up in Bristol, which has a very different accent from that of London, although it was much closer to Grant's pre-Hollywood accent than the voice he used in most films, a product of his attempting to sound more American in order to broaden the range of roles for which he could be cast. Plot Sylvia Scarlett (Katharine Hepburn) and her father, Henry (Edmund Gwenn), flee France one step ahead of the police. Henry, while employed as a bookkeeper for a lace factory, was discovered to be an embezzler. While on the channel ferry, they meet a \\"gentleman adventurer\\", Jimmy Monkley (Cary Grant), who partners with them in his con games. Cast Reception After a disastrous test screening, Cukor and Hepburn reportedly begged producer Pandro Berman to shelve the picture if they agreed to make their next film for free. According to RKO records, the film lost a whopping $363,000, and thus began a downturn in Hepburn's career (causing her to be branded \\"box office poison\\") from which she would eventually recover.\\"Sylvia Scarlett (1936)\\" ‚Äî Notes at TCM. In a review published two days before his death, Andre Sennwald of The New York Times wrote, \\"With what accuracy Compton Mackenzie's novel has been transferred to the screen this deponent knoweth not. But the film has a sprawling, confused and unaccented way of telling its story that might easily be the result of too literal a dramatization of just that sprawling kind of book.\\"Sennwald, Andre (January 10, 1936). \\"The Screen: Katharine Hepburn and Edmund Gwenn in 'Sylvia Scarlett,' at the Radio City Music Hall.\\" The New York Times. 16. Variety said, \\"Despite good production values and some strong performances, 'Sylvia Scarlett' is not a reliable candidate for public favor. The story is hard to get. It is puzzling in its tangents and sudden jumps plus the almost poetic lines that are given to Miss Hepburn. At moments the film skirts the border of absurdity and considerable of its mid-section is downright boresome.\\" The review added that \\"Cary Grant, doing a petty English crook with a Soho accent, practically steals the picture.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Sylvia Scarlett\\". Variety. January 15, 1936. 18. Harrison's Reports stated, \\"The material in the two novels, from which this story was supposedly taken, could have made an outstanding picture. But it was altered radically and was weakened, with the result that it has made an uninteresting comedy. The story is far-fetched and somewhat unpleasant. And the fact that Miss Hepburn goes through most of the picture in male attire may disappoint her followers.\\"\\"'Sylvia Scarlett' with Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Brian Aherne\\". Harrison's Reports. December 28, 1935. 207. John Mosher of The New Yorker was positive and found that despite Hepburn's difficult role, the picture was \\"charming, sparkling with the feeling that Compton Mackenzie gave his novel of romantic vagrants. Indeed, it is that part of the film with Hepburn in breeches that is best.

Biography  Born in Portland, Maine, Colman moved to New York City with his family as a child. His father opened a bookstore, attracting a literate clientele that may have influenced Colman's artistic development. He is believed to have studied briefly under the Hudson River School painter Asher Durand, and he exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1850. By 1854 he had opened his own New York City studio. The following year he was elected an associate member of the National Academy, with full membership bestowed in 1862. His landscape paintings in the 1850s and 1860s were influenced by the Hudson River School, an example being Meadows and Wildflowers at Conway (1856) now in the collection of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College. He was also able to paint in a romantic style, which had become more fashionable after the Civil War. One of his best- known works, and one of the iconic images of Hudson River School art, is his Storm King on the Hudson (1866), now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. Samuel Colman. On the Viga, Outskirts of the City of Mexico, 1892. Oil on canvas. Brooklyn Museum. Late November in a Santa Barbara Ca√±on, California ‚Äì Brooklyn Museum Colman was an inveterate traveler, and many of his works depict scenes from foreign cities and ports. He made his first trip abroad to France and Spain in 1860‚Äì1861, and returned for a more extensive four-year European tour in the early 1870s in which he spent much time in Mediterranean locales. Colman often depicted the architectural features he encountered on his travels: cityscapes, castles, bridges, arches, and aqueducts feature prominently in his paintings of foreign scenes. In 1870 and again in the 1880s he journeyed to the western United States, painting western landscapes comparable in scope and style to those of Thomas Moran. Storm King on the Hudson (1866) is one of Colman's best known works. In the aftermath of the Civil War, watercolor painting became more popular. In 1866, Colman was one of the founders of the American Watercolor Society, and he became its first president from 1867 to 1871. Colman also became skilled at the medium of etching. He was an early member of the New York Etching Club, and published popular etchings depicting European scenes. Colman's artistic activities became even more diverse late in life. By the 1880s he worked extensively as an interior designer, collaborating with his friend Louis Comfort Tiffany on the design of Samuel Clemens' Hartford home, and later on the Fifth Avenue home of Henry and Louisine Havemeyer.Stern, Robert A. M., Thomas Mellins, and David Fishman. New York 1880: Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age. New York, N.Y.: Monacelli Press, 1999. He also became a major collector of Asian decorative objects, and wrote two books on geometry and art, one of which was entitled Nature's Harmonic Unity, the other which was entitled Proportional Form. Colman died in New York City in 1920. See also *List of Hudson River School artists *Thomas Cole *Frederik Macody Lund *On the Divine Proportion References *American Watercolor Society's history.

Location and description The Mount Lofty Ranges stretch from the southernmost point of the Fleurieu Peninsula at Cape Jervis northwards for over before petering out north of Peterborough. In the vicinity of Adelaide, they separate the Adelaide Plains from the extensive plains that surround the Murray River and stretch eastwards to Victoria. The Heysen Trail traverses almost the entire length of the ranges, crossing westwards to the Flinders Ranges near Hallett. The mountains have a Mediterranean climate with moderate rainfall brought by south-westerly winds, hot summers and cool winters. The southern ranges are wetter (with of rain per year) than the northern ranges (). =Southern ranges= Unusual gold specimen from the old Victoria Gold Mine, probably the first gold mine worked in Australia, near Castambul.Victoria Gold Mine The part of the ranges south of and including the Barossa Valley are commonly known as the South Mount Lofty Ranges, and the highest part of this section is the summit of Mount Lofty (). The part of the ranges nearest Adelaide is called the Adelaide Hills and, further north, the Barossa Range. The ranges encompass a wide variety of land usage, including significant residential development, particularly concentrated in the foothills, suburbs of Stirling and Bridgewater, and the towns Mount Barker and Victor Harbor in particular. Several pine plantation forests exist, most significantly around Mount Crawford and Cudlee Creek in the north and Kuitpo Forest and Second Valley in the south. Several protected areas exist near Adelaide where the hills face the city in order to preserve highly sought-after residential land: Black Hill Conservation Park, Cleland Conservation Park and Belair National Park are the largest. The other significant parks in the southern ranges are Deep Creek Conservation Park, on the rugged southern shores of the Fleurieu Peninsula, and Para Wirra Conservation Park at the southern edge of the Barossa Valley. There are many wineries in the ranges. Two wine regions in particular are world-renowned: the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale. Grapes are also grown in the Adelaide Hills and the Onkaparinga Valley. Although no major mines operate in the southern ranges today, there are several large disused ones, and a myriad of small ones. An iron sulfide mine at Brukunga, northeast of Mount Barker, operated from 1955 to 1972, proving a valuable source for the production of superphosphate fertilisers vital for the postwar development of the State's outlying agricultural areas. The runoff from the mine unfortunately proved quite toxic for the local environment, and efforts have been underway since to alleviate the damage. A small short-lived silver and lead mine in the foothills of the ranges at Glen Osmond was first opened just two years after the founding of the State in 1836: it is significant for being not only the first metal mine in the history of the State, but the first in all Australia. South Australia never experienced a nineteenth-century gold rush like those interstate, but gold was mined near both Echunga and Williamstown (in the Barossa). Other mines in the southern ranges include a nineteenth-century silver-lead mine at Talisker near Cape Jervis, which features many remaining old buildings, and the limestone mine at Rapid Bay, which ceased operations much more recently. Copper was mined at Kapunda, Truro and Kanmantoo and may be again and a zinc (and lead, silver and gold) mine is proposed near Strathalbyn. Quarries dot the ranges, the most spectacular and massive of which are in the Adelaide foothills; they supplied much of the quartzite which is to be seen in the enduring \\"sandstone architecture\\" of early Adelaide. Only one railway now crosses the ranges: the major Adelaide-Melbourne line, which was first constructed in the 1870s and has had only minor realignments since (the most significant of which was the boring of a new tunnel at Sleeps Hill). Passenger services used to run from the city to Bridgewater in the heart of the hills and ranges, but now stop at Belair in the foothills. A railway approaches the ranges at Willunga (although it was discontinued in the 1960s and has since been replaced by a cycling trail). The Mount Barker to Victor Harbor line (now used only for recreational purposes) largely skirts the eastern edge of the ranges. North of Adelaide, there is a railway to Angaston in the east of the Barossa Valley, and former railways to Truro and across the ranges near Eudunda to Morgan on the Murray River. The ranges form part of the water supply for Adelaide, and there is an extensive infrastructure of reservoirs, weirs, and pipelines, on the Torrens, Onkaparinga, Little Para and Gawler River catchments. Mount Bold, South Para, Kangaroo Creek, and Millbrook reservoirs are the largest. =Northern ranges= The northern ranges, often confused with the southern Flinders Ranges, and sometimes referred to as the \\"Mid-North ranges\\" or \\"central hill country\\", stretch from hills near Kapunda in the south to arid ranges beyond Peterborough in the northeast. The highest peak in this section (and in all the Mount Lofty Ranges - despite the name) is Mount Bryan (). Other significant peaks include New Campbell Hill () and Stein Hill (), which overlooks Burra. The northern ranges include Belvidere Range, Tothill Range and the Skilly Hills. Mining, although totally absent today, was once a major industry in the northern ranges. The copper mine at Kapunda, just north of the Barossa, operated from 1842 to 1877 and was a major boost to the infant State's economy, but was soon overshadowed by the large workings at Burra, further north. The mine here operated from 1845 to 1877 with a few minor interruptions, and was superseded by even larger workings on the Yorke Peninsula. As testament to the volume of copper at Burra, however, the mine re-opened as an open-cut in 1971, before closing again ten years later. The Clare Valley lies in a shallow fold of the northern Mount Lofty Ranges just southwest of Burra. It is yet another world-class wine-producing area, and is a very popular weekend tourist destination for people living in Adelaide. It is also home to the only conservation park in the northern ranges, Spring Gully. The northern end of the ranges are home to two curiosities: a tiny township by the name of Yongala, familiar to South Australians for commonly being the coldest place in the state (being a hundred kilometres inland, and on a somewhat elevated plateau as with much of the Mid North). The other curiosity is a locality near Orroroo called \\"Magnetic Hill\\". The name stems from a reputation that if you take your car there, it will roll uphill. Wind turbines northwest of Burra. Geomorphology The ranges are part of the Adelaide Rift Complex. The southern ranges and slopes of Mount Lofty overlooking the Adelaide Plains have been block-faulted to form a half-graben structure. The ranges when viewed from the beach or city have a \\"stepped\\" appearance, reflected in an early name for the ranges, \\"The Tiers\\". There are several major normal faults in the Adelaide region, trending northeast to southwest defining these blocks: * Para Fault. This runs from Gawler in the north, through Elizabeth, before disappearing under younger alluvium in the inner northern suburbs. The scarp which this fault has formed is covered with houses in the northern suburbs (Para Hills) and the township of Gawler is nestled at its base where the South Para River emerges from the range. Closer to the city the scarp becomes less defined and is unidentifiable beyond the low hill upon which North Adelaide rests. *Eden-Burnside Fault Zone. This fault zone (composed of several different individual faults) lies at the base of the main scarp of the Adelaide Hills, separating the young Quaternary alluvium of the plains from the Proterozoic sedimentary rocks making up the ranges. It begins around One Tree Hill in the northern suburbs and extends as an escarpment of approximately high in a slightly curving line for about before encountering the sea at Marino. This escarpment is known as the \\"Hills Face Zone\\" and is subject to special zoning restrictions; house prices are very high, as is demand for land, owing to the magnificent views, but many in the community are concerned with maintaining green hills as a background to the plains. A number of creeks cut deep notches in the scarp; one of these, Glen Osmond Creek, provides the site for the major road east out of Adelaide, now called the South Eastern Freeway; only a handful of other major roads extend up the scarp. *Kitchener Fault. This long fault, just a little further to the east, extends from north of the Barossa Valley past the Torrens gorge to meet the Eden Fault in the vicinity of Greenhill. It is most apparent as a fault scarp around Williamstown and Kersbrook. *Clarendon Fault. Running largely parallel to the Eden-Burnside Fault, this forms the escarpment within Belair National Park, which also runs south-east to form the eastern boundary of the southern suburbs, before ending at Old Noarlunga, where the Onkaparinga River emerges from the ranges. An escarpment also extends from the northern end of this fault to form the upper 'tier' of Mount Lofty: Measdays Hill (now carved in half by a massive cutting for the SE Freeway at Crafers West) and Mount Lofty itself are at the top of this scarp. *Willunga Fault. This fault runs parallel to the Clarendon Fault, further south once more, and is the southernmost of the faults. The escarpment it lies at the base of is similarly dramatic, beginning in the Scott Creek Conservation Park and running southwest: Mount Bold Reservoir forms where the Onkaparinga River has been dammed in the middle of the escarpment. Further south, the townships of Kangarilla and Willunga nestle in gullies of the scarp, and the increasingly dramatic and bare face of \\"The Range\\", as it is known (properly Sellicks Hill Range) meets the sea at Sellicks Beach. *Bremer and Palmer Fault Zones. These faults are at the eastern edge of the Mount Lofty Ranges block, and form even more dramatic escarpments than those in the west due to the general lack of the vegetation in the countryside. The latter fault zone is the eastern edge of the metamorphosed Proterozoic rocks of the Kanmantoo group; to the east lie the younger sediments of the Murray River. Towns like Palmer, Sedan, and Cambrai, lie at the foot of the scarp. All the fault zones are still active today, along with the rest of the ranges, and minor earthquakes are relatively common. Larger quakes in the southern ranges are fairly rare: the last to hit a major centre was the 1954 Adelaide earthquake that occurred on 1 March. It measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. A significant aspect of the geology of the Adelaide area is a number of Tertiary marine sands deposits, many of which have been extensively quarried. One of these deposits is around the outer- northern suburb of Golden Grove; another area is around McLaren Vale. Ecology Mount Lofty Botanic Garden Mount Lofty Botanic Garden Lake =Flora= The natural habitat of the mountainsides is woodland of eucalyptus trees mixed with golden wattle acacia trees on the lower slopes, all with an undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. The flowers include a number of endemic orchids. Similar habitats can be found on the offshore Kangaroo Island which is included by the World Wildlife Fund in the Mount Lofty woodlands ecoregion. The western half of Kangaroo Island has more open woodland containing sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) and drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata) and more endemic plant species in general than are found on the mainland. =Fauna= The mountains are home to a number of marsupials such as the koala, western gray kangaroo, southern brown bandicoot and the tammar wallaby on Kangaroo Island and a monotreme (egg-laying mammal), the echidna (while the platypus remains on Kangaroo Island only). Birds include the southern emu-wren which is endemic to the Fleurieu Peninsula. There are a number of reptiles including the endangered Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink. =Threats and preservation= The hillsides have largely been cleared of woodland for fruit growing and other agriculture and the urban growth of Adelaide particularly on the lower slopes, leading to loss of habitat and local extinction of wildlife species including all species of bettong and quoll marsupials and birds including regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), king quail (Coturnix chinensis), brown quail (C. ypsilophora), and azure kingfisher (Alcedo azurea). Clearance and agriculture are ongoing and livestock grazing continues to cause damage to habitats while introduced cats, foxes and rabbits are a threat to habitats and wildlife. Protected areas tend to be small and fragmented. Kangaroo Island has been less affected and also does not have rabbits or foxes, although koalas have been introduced from the Australian mainland and are causing damage to habitats.

Pissouri‚Äôs administrative area is the third biggest in Limassol District. The main settlement of Pissouri is situated about three kilometres away from the bay named Cape Aspro, and is built on the side of a green hill. The settlement is placed in the middle of Pissouri‚Äôs territory. Now they are two distinct communities, Pissouri Village Area and Pissouri Bay Area. The total permanent population is said to reach around 1100 people, about half of whom are Cypriots, the rest foreigners, mainly British, residents and visitors. There are several shops, and many tavernas, restaurants and bars in the village. There is also a Bank of Cyprus branch in the village's central square.  Names  According to some official sources, the name Pissouri derives from the ancient city ‚ÄòVoousoura‚Äô, as reported by Stravonas, a 1st-century BCE - 1st-century CE philosopher, mathematician and geographer.Hatzopoulos, John N., Topographic Mapping: Covering the Wider Field of Geospaiial Information Science & Technology (GIS&T;), Universal Publishers, Boca Raton, 2008, p.6 Some other sources connect the name of the village with pitched-dark nights.According to the Cypriot linguistic idiom, ‚Äòpissouri‚Äô is considered as ‚Äòvery dark‚Äô. A legend reports that the 300 Alamanoi (German) saints who came to Cyprus from Palestine in order to practice in various parts of the island, arrived on the Pissouri‚Äôs coast during such a pitch-dark night. Another legend reports that ‚Äòthe Saint Fathers‚Äô pursued during the post-Christian era, were met in Pissouri‚Äôs region during a really black-night. However, it seems that the name of the village does not eventually stem from those legendaries but from the fact that in the region there was an extensive extraction of skin-sap from pine trees (called ‚Äòpissa‚Äô in Greek). The skin-sap production begun during the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), continued during the Middle-Ages (5th ‚Äì 15th century) and the Frankish era in Cyprus.  Development and occupation  Pissouri has an annual rainfall in the order of 447 millimetres. Local products nowadays are tabled grapes, wine, potatoes and other citrus fruits in smaller quantities planted across the valley spanning from the gulf to the hill, where the settlement is. There are also many olive, carob and almond trees. Unfortunately, during the last years, farmers had to eradicate big part of their vineyards, as they became profitless. During the last decade, and in particular the last 6 years, the residents have shifted to alternative financial resources with a better interest profit. Most of them have extensively dealt with buildings' construction and specifically with the erection of numerous residential places and new neighbourhoods. It is a matter of time before the village becomes literally autonomous in terms of services and facilities found locally. Pissouri seems to evolve rapidly, following the trends of the globalisation and global investments'. Churches The Church of Apostle Andrea was built with voluntary work by the good-willing residents of the community in 1883. The work for the construction of the church lasted for about twelve years. The Stone that the church is built originates from the regions of villages Anogyra and Prasteio villages and was transferred in the village with carts which were dragged by Cypriot donkeys. The church is built in Gothic style. The place that it is built was used as the village cemetery up to 1912. The church is famous for its wooden-carved Icon Stand, which is a real work of art and was manufactured in 1890. The manufacture lasted 10 entire years because of the means of that time. Other chapels are: Saint George, Prophet Elias, Saint Alexandros, Saint Mauritius, Saint Spyridonas.

By sharing such offices, employees make more efficient use of company space and resources. However, hot desking does come with disadvantages‚Äîthese include a lack of permanent space, an unclear work hierarchy, and possibly inconvenient communication between members of a team. There are both advantages and disadvantages to hot desking. From the standpoint of the employee, it might be hard to get used to it, as many different people have different styles of using a desk (adjusting the chair to different heights, moving around decorations, keeping it tidy). However, it is seen that hot desking can increase productivity and communication in a business. An alternative version of hot desking would be in a workplace where employees have multiple tasks and multiple employees may require a certain work station, but not for their entire duties. Thus a permanent work station can be made available to any worker as and when needed, with employees sharing the station as needed. This could be for a single element of one‚Äôs work, for example, when a sales employee needs an office for a client meeting but does not otherwise have need of a personal office. Another example would be when employees need to perform specific tasks at work stations created for those tasks in an assembly line fashion. There, the individual work stations are not set up as personal offices. A collection of such workstations is sometimes called a mobility centre.Office Management: Developing Skills for Smooth Functioning https://books.google.com/books?id=3aiA1URwOXIC&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false With the growth of mobility services, hot desking can also include the routing of voice and other messaging services to any location where the user is able to log into their secure corporate network. Therefore, their telephone number, their email, and instant messaging can be routed to their location on the network and no longer to just their physical desk. Origin The term \\"hot desking\\" is thought to derive from the naval practice of hot racking, where sailors on different shifts share the same bunks.  Tools  With the emergence of hot desking and the increasing presence of technology in the workplace, tools have been developed to make it easier to utilize hot desking in an office environment, to standardize the process, and to automatically enforce basic business rules or policies. Generally, using the hot desking method is accomplished by installing and operating by a piece of software that integrates with the company's email and calendaring systems, with the telephony or PBX systems, and is tailored to the office of each individual company. These software systems usually also allow the company to manage many space-related resources such as conference rooms, desks, offices, and project rooms. Sophisticated software systems for managing these space resources often also manage the support equipment and services such as audio-visual equipment and catering for meeting rooms, lockers and carts for desks and offices, and parking spaces for the people actually using those space resources on the same day. In some cases, the employees are designated to a certain area but because of the hot desking situation, all available seats must look the same. Therefore, in order to enable workers to make sure they are sitting in the right group area (or \\"neighborhood\\"), sometimes colored walls, mousepads, static printed, or dynamic digital nameplates are used. Workers are then designated to sit anywhere in a given group area. For example, if groups are associated with specific group colors, individual group members might be directed to the red zone, or maybe the blue zone, depending on group.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on January 4, 1941, and features Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny. This is the first cartoon in which the name Bugs Bunny is given (on a title card, edited onto the end of the opening title following the success of 1940's A Wild Hare), but the rabbit is similar to the one seen and heard in Elmer's Candid Camera (though his voice is different) and other pre- Bugs shorts. This is Chuck Jones' first cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny, and it was written by Rich Hogan. Voices are provided by Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan. It was produced by Leon Schlesinger. Plot Bugs Bunny has a chat with Elmer. Animation by Bob Cannon. Elmer buys Bugs Bunny in a pet shop (for 98¬¢). When they get home, Elmer builds an enclosure for Bugs, and then serves him dinner (a bowl of vegetables) which Bugs acts angrily towards. Then Bugs is seen grumbling in the night and he eventually takes Elmer's bed as his own. Throughout the short, Bugs irritates Elmer in various ways‚Äîfrom dancing to attempts getting in the shower, etc.‚Äîwhich culminates when Elmer brutally attacks Bugs (in a dark room with humorous fireworks exploding) and sends him out of the house. However, Bugs manages to get back inside and reclaim Elmer's bed. Evolution of Bugs Bunny Bugs Bunny's voice is pitched noticeably lower than in later incarnations of the character. His character is also very different from the more familiar version of Bugs (and even the earlier prototype versions), having a much more aggressive, selfish, arrogant, almost thuggish personality rather than his usual fun loving and comic relief personality. This short is the only one where Bugs has yellow gloves instead of white and no visible front teeth and claims to not eat carrots (yet he eats them and other vegetables while complaining). The song The music in the cartoon includes a variation on \\"While Strolling Through the Park One Day,\\" arranged by Carl Stalling, performed by Elmer and the rabbit. Elmer, of course, has trouble with many of the words, due to his \\"rounded L and R\\" speech impediment. Analysis The rumbling on the other side of Elmer's bedroom was reused in a later cartoon, The Wabbit Who Came to Supper. Availability This short is currently unavailable and unrestored on DVD or Blu-ray until 2020 when HBO Max streaming was released, this cartoon could be available and restored.

Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 May 2013 He lived in the mountains of this desert in a cave near a clear spring and a palm tree, the leaves of which provided him with clothing and the fruit of which provided him with his only source of food until he was 43 years old, when a raven started bringing him half a loaf of bread daily. He would remain in that cave for the rest of his life, almost a hundred years. Paul of Thebes‚Äô visit at Anthony the Great Saint Anthony the Great and Saint Paul the Anchorite, Diego Vel√°zquez, circa 1634 Paul of Thebes is known to posterity because around the year 342, Anthony the Great was told in a dream about the older hermit's existence, and went to find him. Jerome related that Anthony the Great and Paul met when the latter was aged 113. They conversed with each other for one day and one night. The Synaxarium shows each saint inviting the other to bless and break the bread, as a token of honor. Paul held one side, putting the other side into the hands of Father Anthony, and soon the bread broke through the middle and each took his part. When Anthony next visited him, Paul was dead. Anthony clothed him in a tunic which was a present from Athanasius of Alexandria and buried him, with two lions helping to dig the grave. Father Anthony returned to his monastery taking with him the robe woven with palm leaf. He honored the robe so much that he only wore it twice a year: at the Feast of Easter, and at the Pentecost. Veneration His feast day is celebrated on January 15 in the West, on January 5 or January 15 in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and on 2 Meshir (February 9) in the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Anthony described him as \\"the first monk\\". Monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite (Deir Anba Bola) is traditionally believed to be on the site of the cave where Paul lived and where his remains are kept. The monastery is located in the eastern desert mountains of Egypt near the Red Sea. The Cave Church of St. Paul marks the spot where Anthony, \\"the Father of Monasticism\\", and Paul, \\"the First Hermit\\", are believed to have met.\\"St. Paul's Monastery, Red Sea\\", The American Research Center in Egypt He is also the patron saint of the Diocese of San Pablo (Philippines) and is the titular of the Cathedral of the said Diocese in San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines.

Humffray was born in Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales. He was articled to a solicitor, and became active in the Chartist movement, but abandoned his legal studies and migrated to Victoria, Australia in 1853.  From rural Wales to Australia  Humffray arrived in Melbourne on the \\"Star of the East\\" on 19 September 1853, and moved to Ballarat two months later to try his hand at gold digging. At a protest meeting of over 10,000 diggers at Bakery Hill on Saturday, 11 November 1854, Humffray was elected secretary of the Ballarat Reform League. In his view, the diggers' grievances were the result of an unrepresentative political system, which he felt could be changed by moral suasion. Humffray was a member of the three-person delegation which met the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, in Melbourne on Monday, 27 November 1854. The miners' demands for economic and political reforms were rejected. After a particularly vicious licence hunt, a meeting of the Ballarat Reform League was held on Thursday, 30 November 1854 at which the miners rejected \\"moral force\\" as advocated by Humffray. They embarked on the path of \\"physical force\\" by electing Peter Lalor as their leader, and deciding to meet force with force by building the Eureka Stockade. Humffray was not part of the rebellion and played the role of peacemaker in the lead up to the battle at the Eureka Stockade on 3 December 1854. He represented the interests of aggrieved diggers at the Commission of Enquiry into the discontent on the goldfields,Corfield, Justin; Wickham, Dorothy; & Gervasoni, Clare, Eureka Encyclopaedia, Ballarat Heritage Services, 2004, pg 281 and was a vocal defender of the 13 miners who were charged with high treason for their role in the rebellion. He was the editor of the short-lived Ballarat Leader, first president of the Ballarat Mechanics' Institute, and passed first-year law, University of Melbourne (1860). As a result of losing money in mining speculations, Humffray became dependent on charity in his last years. After a long illness, he died a pauper on 18 March 1891.  Political career  When the miners were granted the right to vote and representation in 1855 Humffray was elected unopposed as the member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Ballaarat (1855-1856); then Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for North Grant (1856-1859) then Ballarat East (1859-1871). He served as Minister for Mines (November 1860 to November 1861) and Chairman of the Royal Commission on Mining (1862).  Legacy  Humffray Street, one of the major roads in Ballarat, is named after him, with that being sometime prior to 1858.http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/show_history/118183 Humffray was an Anglican, and was buried in the Ballaarat Old Cemetery, near those who had died in the Eureka rebellion.

The character was created by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Mitch Brian for Batman: The Animated Series and was preemptively introduced into mainstream comics before the airing of her animated debut in 1992. The character has developed significantly. Renee is initially a detective from the Gotham City Police Department, assigned to the Major Crimes Unit, who comes into frequent contact with Batman. She is exposed as a lesbian and resigns from the police force, disgusted by its corruption. She operates as the Question out of a lighthouse that she shares with Aristotle Rodor on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Following a line-wide revision of the fictional world of DC Comics superhero comic books, the revised Montoya character appeared first in Detective Comics #41 (August 2015), in which she was established as Harvey Bullock's new partner. The character made her live-action debut on the first season of Gotham and was played by Victoria Cartagena. She made her cinematic debut in the DCEU film Birds of Prey, and was portrayed by Rosie Perez. Fictional character biography Renee was created for Batman: The Animated Series by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini and Mitch Brian, described in the series bible. She first appears as a uniformed officer partnered with Harvey Bullock. In the follow-up series The New Batman Adventures, Montoya has been promoted from police officer to detective. The comic series Gotham Central describes Montoya as the daughter of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Renee is a recurring character in the Batman-related comics after Batman #475 (March 1992). After she is promoted to homicide detective by Commissioner James Gordon, Renee is partnered with Harvey Bullock. After Bullock is promoted to Lieutenant, Crispus Allen becomes Renee's new partner.Detective Comics #742 (January 2000) Gotham City is destroyed by an earthquake in the Cataclysm crossover. It is soon closed off from the rest of the United States in the No Man's Land story arc. Montoya and Bullock are two of the many Gotham police officers to stay behind with James Gordon in order to keep the peace among the people who remain. Renee is the focus of an uneasy truce between Gordon's forces and the crime boss Two-Face. She reaches out to Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona in helping with aid and relief efforts, and he falls in love with her. In fact, he keeps her restrained in his headquarters against her will. She becomes involved when Two-Face puts James Gordon on trial for perceived wrongdoing. Renee persuades Two-Face to offer a more fair trial, giving Gordon a defense lawyer. Two-Face's Harvey Dent persona takes on this role, and ultimately convinces Two-Face to allow everyone to go free. Gotham City is later re-opened thanks to humanitarian efforts spearheaded by Lex Luthor. Renee, Gordon, Bullock and the surviving officers are re-instated as a police official. In \\"Officer Down\\", Renee is hit hard by a murder attempt on Gordon, and when the assassin walks free, goes to seek vengeance. However, Bullock catches her in the act and persuades her not to pull the trigger, telling her that revenge is not worth her career. =Gotham Central= Montoya and Two-Face. Art by Michael Lark Montoya is one of the main characters of Gotham Central, a comic book series about the Gotham City police department. Believing that the only way to have Montoya is to take everything away from her, Two-Face outs her as a lesbian to the public and frames her for murder. He then kidnaps her, making it look like Montoya has escaped. Two-Face becomes more unstable and the two fight for control of his gun until Batman arrives to save them. Montoya is cleared of all charges and Two-Face returns to Arkham, but Montoya's personal life becomes chaotic, especially with her family: while her younger brother knows about and, to a limited extent, accepts her sexuality, her religious parents disown her.Gotham Central (Vol 2) trade paperback, DC Comics In the 2004‚Äì2005 \\"War Games\\" storyline, Montoya and Crispus Allen are ambushed by the Black Spider, and Allen shoots the villain.Gotham Central #23 (November 2004).

The Spectre is not able to hold them off for long, because they are protected by the same force that protects Libra. Radiant makes sure that Montoya cannot be brainwashed, and teleports her away. Observing the surroundings, she finds Batwoman lying in the streets. Batwoman reveals that she now obeys Darkseid as well, and starts to recite the Equation. It appears, however, that Montoya is completely immune to the Equation; in the following issue, she is seen in complete control of her own mind. Montoya appears in Final Crisis #5, recruited by the underground resistance movement organized by Checkmate. She is told that she must travel the DC Multiverse and gather help for New Earth. In Final Crisis #7 she is seen accompanied by Captain Marvel (of Earth 5) where she gathers a group of alternative versions of Superman that help end the Final Crisis and defeat Mandrakk the Dark Monitor. She identifies herself as a \\"Global Peace agent\\" in Final Crisis #7‚Äîan allusion to the faceless agents of the GPA from the original OMAC series. Starting in Detective Comics #854, Montoya appeared in an ongoing backup feature written by Greg Rucka, with art by Cully Hamner. =Batwoman: Detective Comics= Montoya takes the case of a missing illegal immigrant‚Äîthe young sister of the man named Hector Soliz seeking her detective services. She follows some leads to their hideout and discovers pornographic pictures of the girl, indicating she may have become involved in a child pornography or sexual slavery ring.Detective comics #854 While investigating a businessman whom she believes is involved with the slavery, Montoya is kidnapped and left to die after being tied up in the trunk of a car that is driven into a river. She easily escapes and eventually tracks the slaves to a boat owned by the businessman. After a brief fight with several henchmen, the police arrive and rescue the women, reuniting Hector with his sister. When Montoya briefly returned to Gotham City, she worked with the new Batman and quickly realized that he was Nightwing. Her old partner Bullock also discovered that Renee is the new Question, pointing out that he worked with her long enough to be able to recognize her butt anywhere.Detective Comics Annual #11 =\\"Blackest Night\\"= During the events of the 2009‚Äì2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Montoya is tracked down by Lady Shiva, who claims that she wishes to test her in combat to see if she is a worthy successor to Victor. The two women engage in a brutal fist fight, only to be interrupted when Victor, now reanimated as a Black Lantern, arrives on the scene and attacks them. After a drawn out battle, Renee discovers that Black Lanterns feed on emotions, and that if she is able to cut herself off from her feelings, she will become invisible. She does so, and angered, Victor stalks off into the night, searching for easier prey. Shiva reveals that she never intended to actually fight Montoya, but felt that attacking her would draw Victor out into the open so she could face him again.The Question #37. DC Comics Some time after this, Montoya teams up with the Huntress in order to bring down the criminal network that Renee had earlier encountered. Eventually, the hitman known as Zeiss attacks the women, having been ordered by an unknown client to kill them. Renee appeals to the hitman's greed, offering him more money if he simply fakes their deaths and leaves them be. After this, Huntress takes Renee to Oracle for help in tracking down the client who put out the hit, and is flabbergasted upon discovering that Oracle is in fact \\"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\\". The two women eventually make their way to Oolong Island (home of the Doom Patrol), where they are arrested.Detective Comics #862. DC Comics After escaping from police custody, Huntress and the Question discovered that Vandal Savage is behind the human trafficking network they had been trying to shut down. Savage offers to shut down his criminal network in exchange for one of them taking the Mark of Cain, which had been branded onto his face by the Spectre during the events of Final Crisis. Renee ultimately chooses to accept the Mark of Cain, ending Savage's reign of terror but leaving her face disfigured.Detective Comics #863. DC Comics Following this, the Question appears alongside Batwoman as part of Wonder Woman's team of superheroines when a group of aliens attack Washington D.C.http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/06/ww_600_no_ads-3-copy.jpg Rose Wilson jokingly asks her if she intends to seek an autograph from Wonder Woman, only for Renee to nervously remark that she is trying to work her way up to asking for one.Wonder Woman #600 =Batman Inc.= Montoya seeks out Richard Dragon, who helps her learn to suppress the Mark through her mental willpower.Detective Comics Annual #12 (December 2010) Following Bruce Wayne's return to the 21st century, he establishes Batman, Inc., a global network of Batmen from various nations. Batman sends Renee to Paris, France in order to infiltrate the Golden Portal, a violent cult responsible for a number of deaths. Renee allows herself to be captured and brainwashed by the cult's leader, Korrigan, and ultimately uses mental techniques taught to her by Richard and Victor to overcome Korrigan. With help from Batman and the French vigilante Nightrunner, the members of the Golden Portal are defeated and Korrigan is arrested.Batman Annual #28 (December 2010) =The New 52= As part of The New 52, a 2011 line-wide revision of DC superhero comics, including their fictional histories, Montoya appears in an image viewed by Batwoman on the GCPD's wall of honor. At the 2014 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, James Tynion IV, a writer on Batman Eternal, revealed that the creative team almost included Montoya, but they decided against it, saying, \\"We cut her out because we didn't want her to just be in the background of the GCPD. We want to bring her back for her own big story.\\" Montoya appears in Detective Comics #41, as Harvey Bullock's new partner. =DC Rebirth= DC included Renee Montoya in a line-wide revision of DC superhero comic books, stories and characters they dubbed \\"DC Rebirth\\". Montoya appeared sporadically in Detective Comics, still working for the GCPD and slowly rebuilding her relationship with Kate Kane. The two eventually became a couple again in the final issue of the Rebirth Batwoman series.Batwoman #18 (August 2018) In July 2019, Montoya debuted as the Question in Lois Lane #1 as a supporting character.Lois Lane #1 (July 2019) As the Question, she also plays a minor role in Event Leviathan, also from 2019. Equipment * Montoya uses an advanced energy pistol she found while fighting with Intergang, as well as her police sidearm. * After the death of Vic Sage, Montoya inherited his costume, mask, fedora and trench coat, all of which have been treated to react to the binary gas created by Aristotle Rodor. In addition, Rodor provided Montoya with a shampoo that causes her hair to change color when exposed to the gas. According to the Question: Secret Origin backup in 52, this substance was developed using technology lifted from an old Batman foe named Bart Magan (Dr. No Face) and Gingold Extract, a fruit derivative associated with the Elongated Man. The Question's series by Denny O'Neil presented Pseudoderm as Rodor's attempt to build an artificial skin for humanitarian purposes. * The mask adheres to her face and renders it as a featureless blank when exposed to the binary gas. The binary gas is expelled from a special belt buckle worn by Montoya. The gas also causes her chemically treated costume, fedora, and trench coat to change color, typically to a dark blue. Other versions =Titans Tomorrow= In the alternate future seen in the \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" storyline, Renee Montoya has become the commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department long after a crisis claimed the life of Batman. When Tim Drake became Batman and started killing the villains of Batman, Montoya and her predecessor James Gordon worked to hunt him down.Teen Titans Vol. 3 #17 =Smallville= In the first issue of Batman's debut in Smallville season 11's comic series, Barbara Gordon/Nightwing mentions eluding cops named \\"Allen and Montoya\\". =\\"Flashpoint\\"= In the alternate timeline of the 2011 \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline, Renee Montoya is a bar owner and bartender. She is defensive of one of the alcoholic patrons, Bullock.Flashpoint: Batman: Knight of Vengeance #2 (July 2011). DC Comics =Earth-3= During the 2013‚Äì2014 \\"Forever Evil\\" storyline, a version of Renee Montoya appears on Earth-3 where all heroes are villains and vice versa. Renee's \\"evil\\" counterpart appears in Alfred Pennyworth's flashback. This version of Renee Montoya is still a member of Gotham City Police Department. However, she is a corrupt cop and like the rest of GCPD of this universe who works under Owlman. She is seen with the Earth-3 version of Harvey Bullock in an alleyway pulling their guns out and stopping a family who was out watching a movie nearby. They demand the family to empty out their purses and wallets \\"in the name of the law.\\" The family, however, are also armed with guns and begin firing. They request for backup, but it is denied as the rest of the police are currently helping Owlman track down the Joker (who is a hero in this universe). Renee and Bullock are then run over by Alfred despite them being allies since the Outsider was trying his best to follow Owlman. It is unclear whether Alfred did not see them or he simply did not care as he was in a high-speed chase with the Joker. Renee was either killed from her injuries or when Earth-3 was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor.Justice League #23.4. DC Comics =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the prequel comic to the game Injustice: Gods Among Us, Renee was married to Kate Kane, and part of the Insurgency group in a world oppressed by Superman's Regime. Both sides use performance-enhancing pills granting them superhuman strength, speed, and durability. After the loss of Huntress, Renee became enraged, taking all the pills she could find and heavily overdosed on them with the intention of gaining enough strength to take down Superman on her own, well aware she would die from the drug. She then took out Cyborg in a single blow, took Robin hostage, and challenged Superman to a duel. During the fight, she kept taking additional pills (tripling the already deadly dosage) in an attempt to match or exceed her opponent, until her heart failed because of the strain the chemicals put on her body. Bruce Wayne collected her body and buried her next to the graves of Green Arrow and Black Canary. =DC Comics Bombshells= In DC Comics Bombshells, set in an alternate history 1941, Montoya is a Republican veteran of the Spanish Civil War, now in Berlin fighting with the German resistance group led by Countess Selina Digatti. Montoya was a lover of Kate Kane when the latter fought in the Civil War as one of the American volunteers, though they were driven apart after the death of Jas√≥n, whom they considered their son. She also serves as the Question in this continuity. Reception Renee Montoya was ranked as the 80th-greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine. IGN also listed Montoya as the 87th- greatest comic book hero of all time: a character representing ethnic diversity, who has undergone a tremendous personal transformation from humble beginnings.

She is often serving as a more open-minded and tolerant foil to the more belligerent Harvey Bullock. Like Commissioner Gordon, Montoya is openly supportive of Batman and even works with him in the episode \\"P.O.V.\\" * Renee Montoya appears in The New Batman Adventures, voiced by Liane Schirmer. Live-action Renee Montoya appears in Gotham, portrayed by Victoria Cartagena. In this continuity, she is a recovering drug addict and the former lover of Detective James Gordon's fianc√©e Barbara Kean. She works in the Major Crimes Unit of the Gotham City Police Department where her partner is Crispus Allen. Upon learning that Don Carmine Falcone ordered Detective Jim Gordon to kill Oswald Cobblepot, it is implied that she does not believe he did it but she nevertheless becomes obsessed with having him convicted in order to win Barbara back. She and Allen find a witness at the Gotham pier who saw the shooting, and they promptly issue a warrant for Gordon's arrest at Barbara's apartment. However, her case is ruined when Cobblepot turns up, alive, at GCPD headquarters. She later saves Gordon during a shootout with Victor Zsasz, and promises to help him take on the mob. However, it is revealed that after Gordon's fianc√©e left him she returned to Renee to begin a new sexual relationship, but Montoya eventually pushes her away when Barbara reveals she is still in love with Gordon. She and Crispus Allen did not return for any of the show's following seasons. =Film= Animation * Renee Montoya appears in Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero, voiced by Liane Schirmer. * Renee Montoya appears in Batman: Bad Blood, voiced by Vanessa Marshall. In the film, she meets Kate Kane at a bar where the two seem to get along. Kate gives Renee her contact info, hoping to see her again. She later appears at the end of the film where she joins Kate and her father for breakfast. Live-action * The character of Anna Ramirez portrayed by Monique Curnen in the 2008 film The Dark Knight is partially inspired by Renee Montoya. Ramirez is also featured in Batman: Gotham Knight (Montoya actually serves the character's role in the latter film's novelization) as a member of the GCPD and partner of Crispus Allen (Gotham Knights) and later Wuertz (The Dark Knight). She appears to be a loyal member of the GCPD and ally of Jim Gordon until Sal Maroni outs her as one of his moles in the GCPD to Harvey Dent who is forced to kidnap Rachel Dawes so her mother won't be killed which resulted in Rachel's death. Dent forces Ramirez to send Gordon's family to the location of Rachel's death before flipping his coin for her fate. Since it landed on heads Dent spares her but still knocks her out in spite. Since she did not appear in The Dark Knight Rises, it is likely that she was discharged from the GCPD. * Rosie Perez portrayed Montoya in the film Birds of Prey, based on the female team of the same name. She is presented as a fan of '80s cop movies who often quotes them in her own police work, but despite being a skilled investigator in her own right, Montoya's career has stalled ever since her former partner and current captain took credit for solving a past case. In the course of the film, she is suspended for her fixation on crime lord Roman Sionis as she is unable to provide any evidence of his criminal activities, which leads to her joining the other characters as she tries to track down orphan pickpocket Cassandra Cain after the girl inadvertently steals a vital diamond from Sionis's associate Victor Zsasz. After helping Harley Quinn, Helena Bertinelli and Dinah Lance fight off Sionis's men, Montoya officially resigns from the force to join Dinah and Helena in a new crime-fighting team known as the 'Birds of Prey', funded by money from the bank accounts of the former Bertinelli crime family. =Web series= Renee Montoya appears in Gotham Girls, voiced by Adrienne Barbeau. =Video games= * Renee Montoya appears in a short cutscene in Batman: Dark Tomorrow, voiced by Erin Quinn Purcell. * Renee Montoya as the Question appears in DC Universe Online. * Renee Montoya is referenced in Batman: Arkham Knight.

Neighbouring territories include the Far North Region to the north, the Adamawa Region to the south, Nigeria to the west, Chad to the east, and Central African Republic to the southeast. The city of Garoua is both the political and industrial capital. Garoua is Cameroon's third largest port, despite the fact that the B√©nou√© River upon which it relies is only navigable for short periods of the year. Major ethnic groups include the Fula or Fulani (; ), who are Islamic pastoralists, and numerous Muslim and animist speakers of Adamawa, Chadic, and Nilo-Saharan languages. French is the language of formal education, and Fulfulde, the language of the Fulbe, is widespread as a lingua franca. 2008 Presidential Decree In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing \\"Provinces\\" and replacing them with \\"Regions\\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions. Geography =Land= Bands of alternating metamorphic and sedimentary rock interspersed with granite characterise the north's geology. Granite covered in volcanic basalt makes up the southernmost reaches, which form part of the Adamawa Plateau. A series of faults lies north of this and separate the plateau from the band of metamorphic stone to its north. Random granite deposits also characterise this area. The Mayo Rey and Vina River cut north of this portion, leaving deposits of sedimentary stone except in the granite east. North of this lies a band of sedimentary alluvium, clay, limestone, and sandstone. Faults tentatively follow the B√©nou√© River north of this and form a barrier to split the remainder of the province, with metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, mica, and schists dominating to the south and sedimentary stone making up the north. Another large band of metamorphic rock makes up the territory northwest of the B√©nou√© basin. The Mandara Mountains, which run roughly north‚Äìsouth at the province's Nigerian border, are irregular in that they are volcanic, composed mostly of crystalline and metamorphic rock and granite. The Adamawa Plateau divides the province into two main soil types. Those to the north are mostly shallow and ferruginous, brown or brownish red in colour. On the plateau itself, they are mostly ferralitic or lateritic. The region's annual rainy/dry cycle erodes the landscape and aids in the formation of iron deposits called duricrust or hardpans near the surface. in addition, the area between the Vina and Mbere Rivers and the Mayo Deo valley is hydromorphic, while the volcanic Mandara and Atlantika Mountains, other high points in the province, and the Mayo Oulo valley are composed of relatively young soils high in raw mineral content. The bottom of the B√©nou√© basin is alluvial soil. =Drainage= All rivers in the province experience a tropical regime, with a period of high water during the rainy season during which flooding may occur. The B√©nou√©, Mayo Oulo, Mayo K√©bi, and Mayo Godi are particularly susceptible to this (mayo is the Fulfulde word for river). In contrast, however, the rivers mostly dry up during the dry season, many disappearing completely into the sand. Animals and humans must dig during this period to retrieve water. This means that the port of Garoua on the B√©nou√© is only functional during a small portion of the year. The B√©nou√© River (Benue) serves as the North's primary waterway, as it passes through the port at Garoua. It flows down from the Adamawa Plateau and is enlarged by the Mayo Rey, the Mayo Kebi (which flows into the area from Chad), the Mayo Louti (which flows down from the Mandara mountains) and other rivers. Its valley forms the main part of the B√©nou√© Depression. Several smaller tributaries also flow into the B√©nou√©. All of these waterways form part of the Niger basin. The Lagdo Reservoir is formed by a dam at Lagdo that traps waters from the Benoue and its smaller tributaries the Mayo Godi, Mayo Rey, Mayo Sina, Mayo Oldiri, and others, many of which rise on the Adamawa Plateau. The reservoir provides an important source of hydroelectric power for Cameroon's three northern provinces. Local villagers also use it as a source of fish, and both the lake and the river are used for irrigation. Another significant river is the Vina, which rises in the Adamawa Province, flows through the North, and then empties into the Logone River in Chad. It is swelled by the Mb√©r√© River east of Touboro. Before this, the Mb√©r√© forms the province's southeastern border with Chad for several kilometers. These are the only major rivers in the province that form part of the Chad basin. =Relief= The B√©nou√© Depression constitutes the North Province's primary land feature. This basin runs along the Mayo K√©bi and B√©nou√© River and has an elevation of between zero and 200 metres. The valleys surrounding the various rivers that feed the K√©bi and later B√©nou√© reach elevations only slightly higher than this, averaging 200‚Äì500 metres in the north and 500‚Äì1000 metres in the south (the dividing line is at about 8Àô N). Garoua lies at about 235 metres. Farther north is the Ka√©l√© Elevation. A major fault runs north of the B√©nou√©, roughly parallel to it. South of the B√©nou√© Depression lies the Adamawa Plateau. This descends to the Depression in escarpments and peaks of between 1000‚Äì2000 metres that follow a major fault. Past this frontier region, the plateau slopes south and southeast into the Adamawa Province and Chad. The North's third significant land feature is the Mandara Mountains and their southern extension, the Atlantika Mountains, the likely results of tectonic activity. These chains form most of the western edge of the province, with peaks as high as 1000 metres. The mountains continue north into the Far North Province and Nigeria, though their elevations gradually drop to as low as 500 metres. The surrounding terrain is hilly. The North's highest elevation is Hoss√©r√© Vokr√© (Vokne), an isolated peak of 2,049 metres.

Average rainfall is between 900‚Äì1500 mm per year, decreasing from south to north due to elevation. Garoua, the major city, thus receives between 500‚Äì1000 mm per year. Rainfall in the B√©nou√© Depression is unpredictable, though it rarely drops to less than 1000 mm in any one year. North of the B√©nou√© Depression, a Sahel climate prevails. Here, the dry season lasts longer, and temperatures reach even higher levels. Provincial temperatures average 24 ¬∞C in the south along the plateau. In the Depression, they rise to 26 ¬∞C. North of the reservoir, temperatures climb as high as 28 ¬∞C. Seasons follow a wet/dry pattern, with rough divisions in November (dry) and April (wet). The year begins under the influence of the harmattan winds in the dry season. In this period, temperatures are at their highest and rainfall is virtually nonexistent. This period of stifling heat continues until April, which brings with it torrential rains and lower temperatures. Rains ease up in June, though temperatures remain lower and humidity relatively high. Then in November, the province becomes drier and temperatures cool as a shadow of winter sets in. =Plant and animal life= File:Zone d√©sertique Nord Cameroun.jpgEnvironmental condition during the dry season File:Ch√®vres en paturage dans le Nord du Cameroun.jpgAnimals left with little or no grass to eat during the dry weather File:Palmiers en saison s√®che Nord Cameroun.jpgDry palms due to hash climatic conditions The North Province is a land of savanna. This begins with wooded savanna on the Adamawa Plateau with its thick grasses and isolated copses of trees. This territory was once more heavily forested, but repeated burning and livestock trampling has left this original vegetation only in the valleys. Moving north, the wooded savanna gradually gives way to Sudan savanna or parkland savanna in the B√©nou√© Depression. Here grass cover thins out, and trees become fewer and more isolated, and stunted shrubs become more prevalent. Common species include acacia, baobab, and various palms. Most of these have adapted to the region's harsh dry season and seasonal burning by growing thick bark and shedding their leaves during this period. This area has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the East Sudanian savanna ecoregion. After centuries of human habitation and manipulation, very little of the North's indigenous wildlife survives. Of the countless species that once roamed the area, today only hippopotami, jackals, various monkeys such as baboons, and various species of reptile exist in human-inhabited areas. The region's full diversity of species is today only extant in the handful of protected areas. The B√©nou√© National Park (Parc National de la B√©nou√©) protects 1,800 square kilometres southeast of Garoua at the province's centre. It shelters many large mammal species, including hartebeest, hippopotami, kob, and waterbuck, as well as smaller numbers of buffalo, giant eland, elephants, lions and reptiles such as crocodiles. It has been a protected area since 1968. The 2,200 square kilometres Bouba Njida National Park (Parc National de Bouba Ndjida) is southeast of Garoua on the Chad border. Cameroon created the park in 1968 to protect the black rhinoceros and Derby eland. Many experts today say that the rhinoceros is now extinct in the area today. Other animals in the park include buffalo, elephants, giraffes, leopards, lions, and hippopotami. Farthest south is Faro National Park (Parc National du Faro), which protects 3,300 square kilometres of terrain straddling the Adamawa Plateau and the B√©nou√© Depression. The park houses many reptile species as well as elephants, giraffes, and hippopotami. Today, however, poachers have wiped out much of the park's animal population. Demographics =Settlement patterns= The North Province is moderately populated, averaging 12 to 25 people per km¬≤ in most areas. This density jumps to 25 to 50 people in the river valleys west of the Lagdo Reservoir and in the B√©nou√© Depression. North of Garoua and in the Mandara Mountains, where large populations of non-Muslim (often known collectively by the derogatory name Kirdi) were forced to flee years ago, density peaks at 50 to 100 people per km¬≤. Due to the major port located there, Garoua was at one point Cameroon's third largest city, though its population is 235,996 (2005 Census). The city is today a m√©lange of the region, with large populations of Fulbe, non-Muslim Northerners and immigrants from Southern Cameroon, as well as from neighboring Chad and Nigeria. Dwelling units differ from ethnic group to ethnic group, but many follow a fairly common pattern. The house of the chief often forms the centre of a village, and houses are grouped around it with granaries nearby to help the villagers survive the dry season. Various fields of crops in turn surround homes. A common house type is a round building with a cone-shaped roof. However, houses of cement brick and roofed in sheet metal are quite common in larger settlements. Villages are often clustered along the main roads. In contrast to the province's various settled peoples, the Mbororo Fulbe are nomadic and live in portable, tent-like huts (again, Mbororo is a derogatory word). They do establish semi-permanent settlements called ruga, however, to care for the aged and for women to raise children while their husbands are out to pasture. Territories of the North Province's ethnic groups =People= Magoumaz concession With the exception of small populations of Hausa, Shuwa Arabs, and expatriate Westerners in Garoua, the ethnic groups of the North speak languages of three major language families: Niger-Congo ('Adamawa'), Chadic, and Central Sudanic. The Adamawa-language speakers occupy the majority of the territory. The Mbum inhabit much of Faro division and a large southeastern portion of Mayo-Rey division, with the Dii occupying the vast area in between. The land west of the Mayo Rey is home to several peoples on a roughly south‚Äìnorth axis: Chamba, Fanbe, Gimbe, Komandera, and Vere. The Doayo live east of the river, and the Ndupa, Dugun, another group of Chamba, and the Voko of Poli village neighbour them to the south. The Mond capital is at Rey Bouba, and the Mundang and Mambeya live on the Chadian border at the northeast of B√©nou√© division. Four Fali groups, with territories in the B√©nou√© and Mayo-Louti divisions, form the last member of the Adamawa group: the Fali proper, the Fali Bussime, the Fali Durbeyi, and the Fali Kangu. At the province's borders live various Chadic-language-speaking peoples. The Njanyi begin this band at the northwest of the B√©nou√© division. The Gude lie to their north. Then, from west to east, the northern border is home to the Gawar, Daba, and Guidar. The Bata and Zim complete the Chadic speakers, with three separate concentrations of the former along the Nigerian border in B√©nou√© and Faro divisions, and two areas of the latter at the border with Chad and straddling the Bouba-Njida park. The Bata are further divided into the riverain Bata (west of Garoua and along the B√©nou√© river and into Nigeria) and the inland Bata (or Njirai), who inhabit the Zummo-Malabo Hills. As the only ethnic group in the province to speak a Central Sudanic language, the Ngambay make up the third linguistic group. They live in a large territory on the border with Chad between the Vina River and the Mayo Godi. Though relatively newcomers to the region, the Fulbe or Fulani are the North Province's most numerous ethnic group. Their territory stretches through most of the province's centre, primarily in the B√©nou√© and Mayo Rey divisions. The Fulbe follow two distinct ways of living. The nomadic Fulbe, known to others but not themselves as Mbororo, are cattle herders. They roam the province's grasslands and south into the Adamawa Province, and their settlements are never more than semi-permanent. Mbororo are typically tall, thin people with a mixture of Semitic and African features. In contrast, those Fulbe who have settled are known as sedentary or town Fulbe. They outnumber their pastoral brethren, and they have over many years intermarried with their Sudanese neighbours, whom they now resemble. The North's Fulbe also recognize two main lineages, the wollarbe and yillarga. The groups are traditionally rivals, though they often unite for common cause. Most North Province peoples speak their own distinct languages. Those with the most speakers include Daba, Dii, South Fali, Gidar, Adamawa Fulfulde (spoken by Cameroon's Fulbe), and Ngambay. Due to the Fulbe's numerical superiority and historical domination, Fulfulde is widely spoken as a lingua franca. French is the language of formal instruction. =Religion= Islam is the dominant religion in the north due to the cultural and political domination of the Fulbe. Those ethnic groups who resisted the Fulbe conquests and forced Islamisation are collectively referred to by the pejorative term Kirdi (\\"pagans\\"), though they are not culturally homogenous and do not necessarily identify as a group. Non-Muslim groups include the Chamba and Fali. Some ethnic groups, such as the Mbum and the Guidar, are divided between Muslims and Christians.  Economy  As Cameroon's third busiest port, Garoua has long been a site of commercial development in the region. Despite the fact that the port is new but a shade of its former self, Garoua remains the economic centre of the North Province and of Cameroon's Grand North in general. The city is today a crossroads for goods travelling to and from Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria. The port is only viable during the wet season (July to October). =Agriculture= Sustenance farming Many of the North's ethnic groups farm on small plots for subsistence. The chief among these are the Mbum and Duru. Sorghum, millet (both fast- and slow-growing), and maize are the staple crop throughout most of the province, though manioc (cassava) is also important on the Adamawa Plateau, and rice is especially popular in cities. Other crops include yams along the Lagdo Reservoir and at Tchollir√© and groundnuts in the Mayo-Rey division. Farmers often create their fields by burning an area of its vegetation during the dry season. Only fruit trees or trees useful for animal fodder or firewood are kept, such as baobab, faidherbia, and karita. Crops are planted at the first rains. Traditional farms are laid out in concentric circles centred on the village. These are surrounded by hedges or fences aimed at keeping out livestock. In the Mandara Mountains, these circular plots follow the slope of the mountains in terraces. Virtually nothing grows during the long dry season, so most food must be ground and stored in granaries for use during the rest of the year. Dry season sorghum (Muskwari) is grown along the river banks, relying on the moisture left behind as the rivers recede. Commercial agriculture Cotton grows well in the North's river valleys and constitutes the major cash crop. Most cotton farms in the region are under the management of the ' (SODECOTON), which was established in 1974. Groundnuts are also important in the southern half of the province, especially at the edge of the Adamawa Plateau. The plateau is generally unsuited to commercial crops due to its hard soils. Livestock Cattle are an integral part of the Fulbe way of life, particularly for the pastoral Wodaabe, who place great importance on the number of cattle an individual owns. They roam throughout the province and beyond while their town cousins keep animals around the province's central and northern settlements. The two major breeds are the humpbacked zebu, both the brown and white Fulani zebu, herded by the town Fulbe, and the leaner, lighter-coloured Bororo zebu, herded by the Wodaabe. Primary transhumance routes run through the Faro division and the southeast of the Mayo Rey division and eventually lead to Yaound√©, Douala, or farther south. Modern ranching occurs around the town of Faro, an endeavor made possible by the eradication of the tsetse fly from the region in 1974. alt= Other livestock raised include sheep and goats in the Faro division and on the border northeast of the Mayo Rey division. Most of these are long-legged breeds of sheep and goats that are larger and taller than those of most of the rest of Cameroon. Horses and donkeys are used as beasts of burden and transportation throughout, and the Bata are renowned for their expert skills at horse breeding. Fowl are common, particularly in the northern portions. =Industry= Garoua is the industrial heart of all of Cameroon's Grand North, and numerous factories dot the city. Among the goods produced in Garoua are beer and soft drinks, soap, cotton products such as textiles and cottonseed oil, construction materials, processed foods, and shoes. Figuil and Pitoa are smaller industrial centres. Figuil's factories produce cement and textiles, and those of Pitoa produce oils from groundnuts and cottonseeds. Guider and Touboro also have cotton gins. Handicrafts are an important cottage industry for many of the North's inhabitants. Many of the region's craftsmen deal with fabrics, and weaving of everything from clothing to prayer mats is an important source of income. The North is also home to many skilled embroiderers who finish the many textiles produced there. An artisanat at Garoua provides a major outlet for such craftsmen to sell their wares. Mining forms a small aspect of the North's industrial complex. Limestone deposits are situated at the province's northern bulge, and uranium deposits lie in the B√©nou√© Depression near Poli. Workers mine tin ore from the area northwest of the Lagdo Dam. The Lagdo Dam and Reservoir, which holds 4 cubic kilometres of water, provides a major source of hydroelectric power for Garoua and the area north of it (including the Far North Province). = Transportation = Travel in the North is relatively easy thanks to its large network of roads, many of which are paved. However, the area where the Adamawa Province descends to the B√©nou√© Depression is characterised by winding turns, and traffic accidents are not uncommon. In addition, the area is accessible by air. Garoua is the site of an international airport, and aircraft may land at Poli, Tchollir√©, and Guider on airstrips. Finally, the port of Garoua makes the region accessible by boat, and the B√©nou√© is navigable all the way to Port Harcourt, Nigeria. This waterway is impassable in the dry season, however, and road is the preferred means of transporting goods through the area. =Tourism= Giraffe in Waza Park during the dry season Tourism in the North Province is largely centred on hunting in its national parks. Of these, most travel guides recommend the 1,800 square kilometre B√©nou√© National Park as the most accessible and least poached. The park is popular among fishermen as well. Hunters also visit the Bouba Ndjida Park, though its thick vegetation and large number of rivers make it considerably more difficult to travel in. Faro National Park is little visited, as it is the least accessible to vehicles and it has been mostly poached out. Those who wish simply to view wildlife usually continue north to visit Waza National Park in the Far North. There is also a zoo in Garoua where many of the area's indigenous species are on view. Mount in North Cameroon Relief of North Cameroon Mayo (water court) in North Cameroon Laundry in the Benou√© River in North Cameroon Giraffes in B√©nou√© National Park Antelope in B√©nou√© National Park Administration and social conditions Departments of North Cameroon The province is divided into four departments # B√©nou√©, with its capital at Garoua. # Faro, with its capital at Poli. # Mayo-Louti, with its capital at Guider. # Mayo-Rey, with its capital at Tchollir√©. These are in turn broken down into subdivisions. Presidentially appointed senior divisional officers (prefets) and subdivisional officers (sous-prefets) govern each respectively. The North enjoys a relatively high level of development in infrastructure thanks mainly to its most prominent native son, Ahmadou Ahidjo, Cameroon's first president. During Ahidjo's administration, his hometown of Garoua in particular saw much governmental attention, including state-of-the-art buildings and a modern airport. =Government= The Union Nationale pour la D√©mocratie et le Progr√®s (UNDP) is the most important political party in the area due to its large base of Fulbe supporters. The UNDP has not presented much of a front in several years, however, because the ruling party, the Rassemblement d√©mocratique du peuple camerounais RDPC, is careful to represent Fulbe interests. Traditional political organisation In traditional Fulbe culture, several lamidos rule over individual populations of Fulbe subjects. The government of Cameroon allows these individuals to exercise relatively wide-reaching powers, so they can make laws, judge disputes, and intern prisoners. As the Fulbe possessed an independent emirate until relatively recently, they hold this traditional political structure in high regard. However, human rights groups have pointed to these extra-governmental leaders as some of Cameroon's most egregious human-rights abusers. The prisons at Bib√©mi, Gashiga, Rey Bouba and Tch√©boa are particularly maligned, for example, and some groups even accuse lamidos of keeping slaves from the various Kirdi ethnic groups. Many of the North's smaller ethnic groups maintain traditional political organisation. The Bata divide themselves into several independent chiefdoms, for example. In some of these groups, however, traditional chiefs are mere figureheads. In others, the position does not exist at all. =Education= The population of the North is one of Cameroon's lesser educated due both to traditional culture and to a dearth of schools. The cultural hindrance comes from the traditional role of Fulbe women; girls marry as young as age ten or eleven, and schooling typically stops at this time. Exacerbating the problem is the fact that fewer than 300 schools exist in a province of almost 1,500 villages. This compels parents interested in educating their children to send them away for most of the year, often to large towns where they must fend for themselves or stay with relatives. However, when agriculture forms such an integral part of most of the province's citizens, such a prospect may be tenuous at best. =Health= Like schools, hospitals in the North must serve a large number of spread-out villages. Most health centres are in larger towns or cities, necessitating long-distance travel for some citizens to receive care. Malaria is a major health concern. Similarly, fly-borne diseases such as dysentery sometimes break out, especially in more urbanised centres. Schistosomiasis is also a concern, though locals claim that the Lagdo Reservoir is free of the snails that carry the disease. =Cultural life= The Fulbe observe traditional Islamic holidays such as Ramadan and the Feast of the Ram. In addition, most of the province's non-Muslim peoples maintain a lively traditional culture that includes a number of special ceremonies, dances, and holidays. One of these is the Cock Festival, in which the nephew of the head of a family kills a cock and throws it into a fire; should the cock fall onto its right side, it is considered a good omen. The Tupuri people also perform the Gouma, or the Dance of the Cock, a cacophony of drumming and tambourines and circles of long sticks. The Lam of the Guider people is a ceremony to display marriageable girls.

The Paleo-Sudanese, such as the Guider, represent the region's oldest continuous inhabitants. These peoples inhabited the region well before the 8th century. By the 9th century, various Neo-Sudanese groups migrated into the territory, among them the Chamba, Doayo, Fali, Mundang, and Mbum. The Chamba and Mbum proved the most warlike, forcing other groups to assimilate or find new homes. Over the years, the Mbum became quite cohesive, with a common language, social order, and ruler. The Bata entered the area in two main waves. The first settled along the valley of the B√©nou√© River (River Benue), then the second continued south to Demsa Pwa (old Demsa). During this migration, the Bata fought and absorbed other peoples whom they met. The Bata also settled the site of Garoua (along with the Fali) in the 18th century. Other groups fled the Bata and settle elsewhere, such as the Chamba, Mbum, and Vere. The Chamba continued to migrate (due partially to internal squabbling) well into the colonial period, and they founded many settlements along the way, including Donga, Suntai, and Tissa. Some of Cameroon's other peoples lived in the territory of the North Province at one time or another. The Bali of the Northwest Province descend from the Chamba, for example. The Tikar of the Adamawa and Northwest Provinces probably migrated to their present location from the B√©nou√© Depression. =Kanem-Bornu period= The territory fell to the control of the Islamic Kanem Empire under Sultan (or Mai) Dunama (Dunam) II (r. 1221-1259). Thousands of cavalry subdued the area (known as Mabina) during this period. Under Kanem control, a governor presided over Mabina from the Kanem capital. The area was also nominally under the control of the kaigama, the Kanem military commander and ward of its southern provinces. Kanem control did not last long. Civil war erupted upon Dunama's death, as a succession of warlords occupied the territory in an ever-shifting succession of power. The old empire was not reunited until the reign of Ali Ghaji, who came to power in 1472 and set his capital at Bornu. Slavery and Islam are the two most enduring legacies of the Kanem-Bornu period. Slaves proved a lucrative commodity, and large numbers of them were transported from the area across the Sahara. Kanem-Bornu control brought Islam to the region between 1349 and 1385, though only a handful of elites or rulers ever converted. =Fulbe jihads= Beginning in the 13th century, small numbers of Fulbe herdsmen and settlers began streaming into the territory from present- day Nigeria. Over time, Fulbe numbers grew, and the immigrants began to shift from subservience to other ethnic groups to settling Fulbe-only settlements. They also embraced Islam beginning in the 17th century. By 1804, Fulbe numbers had reached the point where the herders had to seek new pastureland and the settlers tired of paying homage to non-Fulbe rulers. The sentiment reached its peak when Fulbe mystic Usman Dan Fodio declared a jihad in what is today northern Nigeria and Cameroon. Modibo Adama became lamido of Fumbina, charged with conquering the territory for Usman's Sokoto Empire. In areas with sizable Fulbe populations, Adama's task proved fairly simple. The settlements at Bundang, Chamba, Chebowa, Deo, Faro, Garoua, Guringa, Kilba, Malaba, Rai, Song, Turua, and Zummo fell easily, Garoua in 1813. In other areas, Adama met with staunch resistance. He first struck at the Bata of Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. Fulbe raiders enslaved Bata resisters in great numbers, and those Bata who could fled south to found Demsa Mosu (new Demsa) and Bata Batchama to the north. Those peoples who were unwilling to submit to Fulbe supremacy were forced to flee, many of them to the forbidding Mandara and Atlantika Mountains. Adama allied with forces from Kanem-Bornu to pursue the Mandara people. He led the charge to conquer Guider by 1810, then he moved on the Mandara capital of Douolo. Adama took these settlements and other smaller ones. The remainder of the Mandaras fled to the mountains that today bear their name. Adama had reached well into the Adamawa Plateau by 1825. Upon Adama's death in 1847, almost all of northern Cameroon was under the rule of various Fulbe lamidos of the Sokoto Empire. What is today the North Province fell into the Garoua-Gurin and Song-Guider districts. The centralised administration (headed from Yola in present-day Nigeria) aided communication and trade throughout the region. Slaves formed a large portion of the economy, and were traded for horses and salt. In addition, the jihads cemented Islam as the dominant religion in the area. Non-Fulbe peoples were forced to either submit to Fulbe control (and the rule of non-native rulers) or to continue their resistance long after Adama's death. The Fali of the B√©nou√© Depression led the Fulbe to fortify Garoua, which they called Ribadou-Garoua. Meanwhile, the new Muslim empire attracted Muslims from other areas to immigrate, and Hausa, Bornu, and Shuwa Arabs moved in the late 19th century. =European contacts= The explorer Dr. Heinrich Barth, a German under British patronage, visited Garoua in 1851 as a guest of the emir at Yola. Dr. Gustav Nachtigal, another German, led a later expedition in 1869. Nachtigal became a guest of the sultan of Bornu, and with his permission penetrated the area south to the Adamawa Plateau, where he remained until 1873. Nachtigal took careful note of the region's various peoples, their relations with one another, and those goods or produce that might prove attractive to German interests. Germany followed up on Nachtigal's findings by sending two Englishmen, J. H. Ashcroft and Edward E. Flegel, and a missionary named Hutchinson in 1879. The trio reached Garoua on 4 September and began the exploration of the upper B√©nou√© River. Flegel led a second expedition in 1882, travelling far and wide and negotiating treaties to give the Germans a monopoly on ivory in the area. He died in 1883, however, cutting the project short. Nonetheless, Germany annexed the \\"Kameruns\\" in 1884. Meanwhile, British traders set up trade in Garoua in 1890 for ivory, salt, and textiles. =German administration= Despite the new overlords, the northern territory of the Kameruns was mostly ignored; it was difficult to reach and its goods were of little priority compared to those of the southern forest zone. The only significant northern focus for the colonials was the port at Garoua. The first German administrators reached the settlement in 1901. The Germans then continued the development of Garoua as a port and a gateway from North to West Africa. In 1902, Garoua became the capital of the Ngaound√©r√© and Garoua administrative unit. The Germans left much of the administration of the territory to the traditional rulers. They particularly favoured the Fulbe lamidos, and they encouraged other ethnic groups to convert to Islam and thus fall under the control of these rulers. Nevertheless, those lamidos and other rulers who showed too much independence or disregard for German supremacy were ousted or killed. During World War I, Garoua and the surrounding territory formed a major focus of the British African front. Under Hugh Cunliffe, British troops attacked Garoua on 30 August 1914, but were repulsed. Cunliffe retreated to Yola (at this time also German territory). The Germans counterattacked, leaving Garoua defenseless. Cunliffe took the city and used it as a staging area for further gains against the Germans. After the German surrender of 1918, the present North Province territories fell under a League of Nations mandate, to be administered by France. =French administration= The French maintained a similar policy of governing the area through the Fulbe. Also like the Germans, recalcitrant rulers found themselves quickly deprived of their positions. Missionaries also entered the region, such as the Lutheran Fraternal Mission in Garoua in 1919. Still, the French largely ignored the area except for the B√©nou√© port, which they enlarged in 1930. They also introduced a hardier variety of cotton (allem) in 1931. The French orchestrated further road building in the area, including a major route from Foumban to Garoua via Ngaound√©r√©. In addition, Garoua received a large airport. The region fell into the Mora-Garoua division, administered from Garoua. Under Andr√©-Marie Mbida, first premier of Cameroon after France granted it self-governance in 1956, the North's Fulbe majority rose in opposition, especially against the 1957 Abong-Mbang Resolutions. The Union Camerounaise political party with its large Fulbe support base formed the nerve centre for this opposition. In the resolutions, Mbida had called for a \\"democratisation\\" of Cameroon's north, which the lamidos saw as an attack on their traditional power. They thus threatened to secede to join French Chad, which set into motion a series of events that led to Mbida's resignation. Ahmadou Ahidjo, a northern Muslim, took his place on 18 February 1958. =Post-independence= On 1 January 1960, Cameroon gained its independence with Ahidjo its first president. The period of Ahidjo's presidency proved a boon to the territory, as the native son relished great projects on Garoua and the surrounding zone, particularly in the road network. He also initiated SODECOTON to supervise and ameliorate the region's cotton- based economy. The Northern economy, long centered on Garoua, took a severe blow during the Biafra Secessionist War, which broke out in 1967 in Nigeria and severely hampered trade along the B√©nou√©. Even at the war's end in 1970, the port of Garoua never fully reached its previous levels of commerce. Under Paul Biya, Cameroon's second president, the North continued to enjoy some improvements, as Biya was careful to cater to the region's Fulbe majority. Nevertheless, upon Biya's accession to power, the Cameroonian press accused an Ahidjo collaborator named Moussa Yaya of trying to turn the northern lamidos against the new president. Biya's main change to the region came in his splitting of Cameroon's Grand North into three provinces, the Adamawa, the North, and the Far North in 1983. That same year, Biya reshuffled his cabinet, and Ahidjo retaliated by urging all northern ministers to resign from the government. Biya retaliated by dismissing all ministers who had served under Ahidjo, claiming that some of them had participated in an assassination attempt on him. The alleged plotters were tried and found guilty on 27 February 1984. Ahidjo escaped to Paris. A further affront to Biya's rule came on 6 April 1984 when members of Cameroon's Republican Guard who hailed from the north attacked various government buildings in an attempt to overthrow the government. They also failed. In the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the Central African Republic arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the North Region, East Region, and Adamawa Region.

She served as Adolf Hitler's hostess at many state functions and thereby staked a claim to the title of \\"First Lady of the Third Reich\\".Gun, p. 127. Early life She was born Emma Sonnemann in Hamburg, Germany on 24 March 1893 to a wealthy salesman. After schooling, she became an actress at the National Theatre in Weimar. On 13 January 1916, Sonnemann married actor Karl K√∂stlin in Trieste. Thereafter, she was known as Emmy K√∂stlin. In her autobiography, G√∂ring said that she and K√∂stlin soon realized that they were more suited as friends and soon separated. They eventually divorced in 1926. Marriage to Hermann G√∂ring On 10 April 1935, she married the prominent Nazi and Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring, becoming Emmy G√∂ring. It was also G√∂ring's second marriage; his first wife, Carin, had died in October 1931. She was given an unsolicited membership to the Nazi Party during Christmas 1938.Klee, pp. 187-8 Their daughter, Edda, was born on 2 June 1938. Edda was reported as being named after Countess Edda Ciano, eldest child of Benito Mussolini. Time reported: \\"Herr and Frau G√∂ring became her fast friends.\\"Time magazine: \\"Lady of the Axis\\" published 24 July 1939. However, in her autobiography, G√∂ring said her daughter was named after one of her friends. Hermann G√∂ring named his country house Carinhall after his first wife, while referring to his hunting lodge at Rominten (now Krasnolesye)the Reichsj√§gerhofas \\"Emmyhall\\". =\\"First Lady of the Third Reich\\"= Emmy G√∂ring served as Hitler's hostess at many state functions prior to the Second World War. This and her claim to be the \\"First Lady of the Third Reich\\" created much animosity between herself and Hitler's future wife, Eva Braun, whom she snubbed and openly despised. Hitler consequently issued angry instructions to Hermann G√∂ring demanding that Emmy treat Eva with more respect; one of the outcomes of Emmy's condescending attitude toward Eva was that she was no longer invited to Hitler's Bavarian retreat, the Berghof.Gun, pp.127-28 As for Eva Braun, she allegedly never forgave Emmy for having assumed the role of \\"First Lady of the Reich\\".Gun, p.162The role of First Lady representing the regime was also bestowed upon Magda Goebbels. Beside having a close relationship with Hitler and hosting state events, she received letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.; As wife of one of the richest and most powerful men in Europe, she received much public attention, was constantly photographed, and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle well into the Second World War. Her husband owned mansions, estates and castles in Austria, Germany and Poland and was a major beneficiary of the Nazis' confiscation of art and wealth from Jews and others deemed enemies by the Nazi regime. Her husband celebrated their daughter's birth by ordering 500 planes to fly over Berlin (he stated he would have flown 1,000 planes as a salute for a son). After the end of the war, a German denazification court convicted her of being a Nazi and sentenced her to one year in jail. When she was released, 30 percent of her property was confiscated, and she was banned from the stage for five years. Later years and death Some years after her release from jail, Emmy G√∂ring was able to secure a very small flat in a building in the city of Munich and remained there for the rest of her life. In her final years, she suffered from sciatica. She wrote an autobiography, An der Seite meines Mannes (1967), published in English as My Life with Goering in 1972. Emmy G√∂ring died in Munich on 8 June 1973 at the age of 80. She is buried at Munich Waldfriedhof. Selected filmography *William Tell (1934) References Notes Sources *Gun, N.E.

It represents the international artistic style of the royal courts in the court of Louis I of Hungary. Its full name is: Chronicon pictum, Marci de Kalt, Chronica de gestis Hungarorum, that is Illustrated Chronicle, Mark of Kalt's Chronicle About the Deeds of the Hungarians.  History of the chronicle  The chronicle was written by M√°rk K√°lti (lat. Marci de Kalt) shortly after the year 1358, with the last of the illuminations being finished between 1370 and 1373. The chronicle was given by the Hungarian king Louis I to the French king Charles V, when the daughter of Louis, Catherine, was engaged to Charles's son Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans. The chronicle was then given to ƒêorƒëe Brankoviƒá in 1456, where it was copied, and later lost, possibly spending some time in Turkish possession. The chronicle reappears in the first half of the 17th century in royal archives of Vienna by unknown means, which is why it is also referred as the Vienna Illuminated Chronicle. The manuscript is now kept in the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library in Budapest (Orsz√°gos Sz√©ch√©nyi K√∂nyvt√°r, Budapest).  Depicted history  The 147 pictures of the chronicle are great sources of information on medieval Hungarian cultural history, costume, and court life in the 14th century. Many miniatures seen inside this chronicle are painted with gold. The artistic value of the miniatures are quite high, if we compare similar miniatures from other parts of Western Europe from the same time. The characters are drawn with detail and with knowledge of anatomy; for example, even the eyeballs are painted, a fact which can only be ascertained by using a microscope on the miniature. All miniatures showing Attila the Hun are disrupted or even rubbed out (especially the last miniature depicting Attila's death); this cannot be due to the time as all other miniatures and text are preserved well. The miniatures make use of symbolism, i.e. \\"primus ingressus\\" ('first incoming') is with a camel, while the \\"secundus ingressus\\" ('second incoming') is with a white horse, probably meaning that entering the Carpathian Basin the first time was not a successful or was a culturally diverted act (as the camel is a \\"diverted\\" horse and white horse is the \\"pure quality\\"). The text of Latin is without error and is representing a high quality.

It was built in 1987 at the Lenin Shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. Mir is the second largest of six sister ships designed by Polish naval architect Zygmunt Chore≈Ñ and weighs 2,385 tonnes. It is 109.2 m long, with a beam of 13.9 m and a draught of 6.3 m. The main mast is 52 m high and along with the other masts supports a total sail area of 2,771 m2. Its sister ships are Dar M≈Çodzie≈ºy, Druzhba, Pallada, Khersones, and Nadezhda. Mir is 8 m shorter than the second longest current sailing ship, the STS Sedov (117.5 m). Its shipowner is the Admiral Makarov State Maritime Academy (AMSMA) in Saint Petersburg who operates Mir as its main training vessel. Background This ship was originally constructed as a cadet training ship, designed for carrying between 70 and 144 cadets. The total transport capacity is 199 people. In addition to the original training role, Mir now also offers sailing trips, daytrips and \\"cruises\\" between ports on a commercial basis; opening up the experience of sailing on Mir to those outside of Russia. Achievements Mir has taken part in many races, including the annual The Tall Ships' Races organised by Sail Training International, winning various prizes. In the Grand Regatta Columbus 1992, celebrating the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, Mir came out as the absolute winner. Mir was involved in the SAIL Amsterdam event in August 2010. It sailed into the harbour and was open to the public for several days.

In 1986, a task force under the leadership of Sally Ride was asked to formulate a new strategy for NASA. The report was issued in 1987. The Ride Report proposed four main initiatives for study and evaluation. These were: # Mission to Planet Earth # Exploration of the Solar System # Outpost on the Moon # Humans to Mars \\"Mission to Planet Earth\\" would be centred on the observation of our home planet. New technologies for observation would be needed, and launch capabilities for geostationary and polar orbits. The space station that was under planning at the time this report was issued, is called simply \\"the Space Station\\" and is more ambitious than the current ISS, in that it would be well- developed enough to have ability for assembly of satellites and platforms in orbit. A transfer vehicle to launch these into geostationary orbit is proposed as well. In the section \\"Exploration of the Solar System\\", the report points out that there are too few planetary exploration missions planned. It proposes some new missions, such as a cometary mission, an extended Cassini mission (including three probes; one for the study of the atmosphere of Saturn, one atmospheric Titan probe and one to land on Titan) and a Mars sample return mission. A permanent lunar outpost is discussed in \\"Outpost on the Moon\\". This goal would be reached through three phases, where the first would deal with robotic exploration during the 1990s to find a suitable site. In the second phase, astronauts would be launched to the Moon on a Lunar transfer vehicle from the Space Station. They would bring scientific instruments and equipment and modules for the outpost. In the third phase, the outpost would be a permanent installation, with closed-loop life-support systems, and great abilities for exploration of the Moon. According to the plan, there would be a crew of 30 living and working on the Moon by 2010. In \\"Humans to Mars\\" the ambitious goal of manned Mars landings is proposed to happen as soon as 2010. Preparations for these missions include robotic exploration of Mars, with orbiters, rovers and sample return missions. The Space Station was to be used for study of the human body during long space flights. The construction of an outpost on Mars could begin during the 2020s. The Ride Report also recognizes the risks of making the Space Station dependent on one single launch vehicle - the Space Shuttle. It proposes the development of a shuttle-derived cargo launcher, as a way of diversifying the launch fleet.

It usually tells who manufactured the case. If it is a civilian case it often also tells the caliber: if it is military, the year of manufacture is often added. The left cartridge's headstamp says \\"FC 223 REM\\" which means that it was made by Federal Cartridge Co. and it is in the caliber \\".223 Remington\\". The cartridge on the right has a headstamp that says \\"LC 99\\" with a symbol that consists of a cross in a circle. This cartridge was made in 1999 by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, in Independence, MO, USA. The symbol on this headstamp means it meets NATO specifications. The headstamp is punched into the base of the cartridge during manufacture. A resource for identifying where the ammunition originated can be found at Cartridge Collectors.

The \\"BB\\" is at 12 o'clock and small kangaroos are positioned counter-clockwise at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock. Brass is sold in lots of 20-case cartons and can be made to customer's specifications with personalized headstamps. * ICI-ANZ Imperial Chemical Industries - Australia / New Zealand (1940s - 1980s) - Deer Park, Melbourne, Victoria. Manufactured cartridges and shotshells from the 1940s until the late 1970s. They also made brass cases for filling and loading by their parent company in the United Kingdom and produced Australian-gauge shotshells for the local market. The factory now makes commercial explosives under the ORICA brand. * RBA or RIVERBRAND Riverbrand Ammunition Company, (1945? - early 1980s) - Hendon, South Australia, Australia.RIVERBRAND Syd Churches, owner of the Taipan Bullet Company, bought out the defunct Small Arms Ammunition Factories No. 3 & 4 at Hendon after the war. Initial production just remanufactured old military-surplus brass cases with new RWS- made non-corrosive Berdan primers. They then mated them with Taipan- manufactured bullets to make cheap .303 Imperial and 7.62mm NATO ammo. Early new production (marked \\"RBA\\") used Berdan primed brass cases. Full production (marked \\"RIVERBRAND\\") used newly manufactured Boxer-primed cases in a variety of service pistol and \\"wildcat\\" sporting rifle cartridges, as well as new brass for handloaders. They also made ammo for Sportco in Adelaide under the SPORTCO headstamp. Riverbrand was always a small-scale endeavor, as there was too much competition from Super Cartridge Company (their only domestic manufacturing rival) and foreign ammunition manufacturers. * SUPER Super Cartridge Co. (? - 1985) - Marybyrnong, Melbourne, Victoria. Manufacturer of cartridges, shotshells, and bullets and brass cases for handloading. They originally sold sporting cartridges made from reloaded Australian-made .303 Imperial brass and sold \\"wildcat\\" cartridges made from the base .303 cartridge. (These usually had the original Small Arms Ammunition Factory headstamp on them). They also made proprietary \\"wildcat\\" ammunition for the MYRA Sports Store in Broken Hill, New South Wales. They were sued for copyright infringement in the early 1980s by Olin-Winchester for their similar one-piece polymer shotshell design. They were barred from making the shells, gave up manufacturing shotshells altogether, and later went out of business in the mid-1980s. * TAIPAN Bullets (late 1980s-2017) - Gympie, Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett, Queensland. After Churches' death in the late 1970s, RIVERBRAND's bullet- making machinery was sold and moved to facilities in Queensland, where it was set up as TAIPAN Bullets.TAIPAN Bullets Owner Malcolm Bone manufactured bullets in small lots for handloaders.

Pistol & Rifle ammunition uses \\"IM\\" as headstamp, the last 2 digits of the year of manufacture and 2 digits for the designation. Revolver and Shotgun shells are stamped as \\"Indumil\\" and the calibre. China NORINCO (North Industries Corporation) - Beijing, People's Republic of China. Operates several state arsenals that produce weapons and munitions for both the military and civilian markets. Makes the Big Star rimfire and China Sports centerfire ammunition brands. Currently they make 9√ó18mm Makarov, 9√ó19mm Parabellum, .45 ACP, .223 Remington [5.56√ó45mm], 7.62√ó39mm Soviet, and .308 Winchester [7.62√ó51mm] ammo. NORINCO 7.62√ó39mm Soviet ammunition was banned from importation into the United States in February, 1994. This was due to the fact that the military surplus ammunition couldn't pass the \\"magnet test\\". Non-compliant semi-armor-piercing and armor-piercing rounds have steel penetrators or steel cores that will be attracted by a magnet. The NORINCO copper-plated steel-jacketed Full Metal Jacket bullets would be attracted by a magnet - making it hard to distinguish between compliant lead-core and non- compliant steel-cored ammunition. =Arsenals= Ammunition headstamp has the arsenal number and the last 2 digits of the year of manufacture. The following are arsenals known to produce civilian lead-core ammunition. *31 or 031 State Factory 31 - (Commercial ammo is packed in two-tone red-black box with white lettering and the NORINCO and China Sports names in gold lettering.) *71 State Factory 71 - (Commercial ammo is packed in plain light green box with black lettering and the NORINCO name and symbol in red lettering on white backing) *311 State Factory 311 - (Commercial ammo is packed in plain yellow box with black lettering and the NORINCO name and symbol in red lettering.) *351 State Factory 351 - (Commercial ammo is packed in plain gray box with black lettering and the NORINCO name and symbol in red lettering.) =Manufacturers= *CBCC Commercial ammo is packed in a plain cardboard box stamped with purple ink.

Theories abound: it was made for use by Chinese- backed insurgents, it was designed to get in on the surplus ammo market, or it was designed to make users leery of Western-made surplus ammunition and get them to buy new foreign-made ammo. *LC 52 Chinese copies of American .30 Carbine ammo with forged Lake City (headstamp \\"LC\\") markings. The ammunition was copper-washed steel-jacketed bullets with copper-washed steel cases. (This makes it magnetic - so it may fail the BATF magnet test used to detect illegal semi-armor-piercing and armor-piercing steel-core penetrators). Some are found in brass cases, and are readily identifiable after firing, as these cases are still Berdan primed. Unlike the USGI ammo, which has non-corrosive Boxer primers, it has corrosive Berdan primers. The cases have longitudinal scratches along the sides, like they have been reloaded. The bullet has a black sealant at its base and the primer has a clear pinkish-red sealant rather than an opaque red sealant. They come packed in 50-round cartons. Unlike US military ammunition, which have glued seams and an arsenal label printed-on or glued-on the box, the boxes' seams are stapled and are crudely stamped 7.62mmLC in blue ink on the top.LORE OF GUNS: Chinese Manufactured .30 Carbine Ammunition with LC52 headstamp by Colin Riley It is reported to have high pressures that are unsafe to use in an M1 carbine, especially a vintage one. *RG 60 Chinese copies of British 7.62mm NATO L2A2 ball ammo with forged Radway Green markings. The lettering on the counterfeit cartridge headstamps are shallow and crude compared to that of Radway Green. The ammunition was copper-washed steel-jacketed bullets with copper-washed steel cases and corrosive primers. It came packed loose in a green-painted 300-round zinc \\"spam can\\" with a cloth handle attached to \\"D-rings\\" on the sides.CHINESE AMMO CANS It also came packed with knockoff 5-round British Mk.3 chargers marked with forged MTY 60 markings (indicating Mettoy, a former British government contractor); these came packed 5 to a can.CHINESE STRIPPER CLIPS The knockoff chargers can be identified by the fact that the tool stamp is in a smaller typeface than the genuine models.IAA: Chinese 7.62 x 51 with RG 60 L2A2 headstamp?

It was originally released in 1968 by Decca Records (Cat. #DL 75043), while Shatner was still starring in the original Star Trek series, and began his musical career. The album's cover nicknamed Shatner \\"Captain Kirk of Star Trek\\" most likely to boost sales and appeal to fans of the show. The concept of the album was to juxtapose famous pieces of poetry with their modern counterparts, pop lyrics. The album is best remembered for showcasing Shatner's now-famous vocal style‚Äîspoken word with dramatic pauses and flourishes. In the decades since its release, most of the album's tracks have been used satirically, either on compilation albums meant to showcase bad celebrity singing (the Rhino Records \\"Golden Throats\\" series) or by radio disc jockeys looking for laughs. On the other hand, many praise the album in the genre of spoken-word music. Critical reception In a retrospective review in 2011, Greg Prato of music database website AllMusic rated The Transformed Man four-and-a-half out of a possible five stars, although with serious reservations. He stated that when listening to the album, \\"it's unclear if Shatner is merely having a good time and goofing around, or if he's embarrassingly dead serious, and creating an overly indulgent work. Most of the album turns out to be a bit too tedious...\\" He also noted that \\"you cannot tell if Shatner is play-acting or painfully serious. The result is a must hear, (unintentional?) comedy classic,\\" comparing this attraction to that of comedian Andy Kaufman. However, in 2006, Q magazine ranked The Transformed Man No. 45 in their list of the 50 worst albums ever. In 2000 it was voted number 3 in the All-Time Worst Albums Ever Made from Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Furthermore, in 2016, the website Alternative Nation crowned the album number 1 on a \\"Top 10 Musical Oddities\\" list. In 2020, the Riot Act Podcast ranked it at #11 on their worst albums of all time list, during the continuous segment, 'Broken Records', in which the duo hosts of Remfrey Dedman and Stephen Hill, attempt to find the worst album ever made. The album is currently featured alongside the likes of Bob Dylan, Lou Reed and Viva Brother.

He is best known for his three studio albums: Northern Lights, Drive and 100 Reasons to Live, and winning the prestigious A State of Trance Tune of the Year award three times. Background Gareth Emery was born in Southampton, England, United Kingdom His sister is the singer-songwriter Roxanne Emery. He lived in Southampton until the age of 26 before relocating to Manchester, England, U.K. where he had a studio and ran a night club and record label, both called Garuda. He has a degree in Politics from University of Warwick and is trained in classical piano. Prior to becoming involved in electronic music he played guitar in a punk band in the mid-nineties. He now lives in Los Angeles with his wife Kat and two daughters. Emery's production style is influenced by various genres of electronic dance music. Breakthrough Emery's debut vinyl release was a white label remix of The Shrink's \\"Nervous Breakdown\\" which was released in early 2002. However, the track that launched his career is generally considered to be his third release: GTR ‚Äì \\"Mistral\\". It was created entirely on a computer over the course of a two-week holiday in Provence. Paul van Dyk debuted the track live on the radio during the Nature One Festival in 2002 and it subsequently received support from some of the world's leading DJs, including Ti√´sto, Armin van Buuren and Ferry Corsten. Emery was ranked at #34 in DJ Mag's Top 100 poll in 2006, #31 in 2007, #23 in 2008, #9 in 2009 and #7 in 2010. In 2011, Emery dropped to #13. He was ranked at #14 in 2012, and dropped further to #51 in 2013. in 2014 he dropped to #74, and in 2015 he is out of the DJ Mag Poll. Albums and remixes Emery has released five compilation mix CDs during his career: The Five AM Sessions (2005), The Podcast Annual (2007), The Sound Of Garuda (2009) and The Sound Of Garuda: Chapter 2 (2011) and Electric For Life in 2015. His debut artist album Northern Lights was released in 2010, and achieved considerable success, climbing to no.1 in the US iTunes dance chart. The album also contained one of his most successful tracks \\"Sanctuary\\", which was voted the 2nd biggest track of 2010 by listeners of Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance radio show, and then became the most played record of 2011 on US' Sirius XM Radio dance station, BPM. In 2011, a remixed edition of the album was released entitled Northern Lights Re-Lit with remixes by acts including Hardwell, Arty, Giuseppe Ottaviani, John O‚ÄôCallaghan, Lange and Ashley Wallbridge. On 1 April 2014, Gareth Emery released his second studio album Drive, which was followed by Drive Refueled remix album a year later. In 2006, Gareth Emery remixed \\"Flow\\" by Vinny Troia and Jaidene Veda on Curvve Recordings, which climbed to #24 on Billboard magazine's \\"Hot Dance Club Play\\" charts. On 1 April 2016, Gareth Emery released his third studio album 100 Reasons to Live, featuring collaborations with Alex & Sierra, Janet Devlin, Lawson and Christina Novelli. In 2016 Emery has also released a single \\"CVNT5\\" together with Ashley Wallbridge. The \\"CVNT5\\" music video is a satirical view on careers of popular electronic dance music acts. On 30 January 2017, Emery released a single titled \\"Saving Light\\" with artist Standerwick and Haliene on the Canadian label Monstercat. The song and its music video were a collaboration with the charity Ditch The Label in an effort to prevent bullying among children and young adults. The music video for Saving Light has received over 2 million views on YouTube as of December 2017. On 21 December, Armin van Buuren announced that Saving Light won the A State of Trance \\"Tune of the Year\\" for 2017.  DJ Mag controversy  Between 2006 and 2013 Gareth Emery ranked in DJ Mag's Top 50 DJs in the world, peaking at No. 7 in 2010. However, in 2013, he publicly denounced the poll due to the huge marketing budgets involved, asking fans no longer to vote for him, and donated his marketing budget to charity instead: > \\"So here's an alternative Top 100 message: Don't vote for me. Seriously, > when you buy a ticket to see me in a club, I consider that a vote. When you > blast my music in your car, or share it on Facebook, or tell your friends > about it, that's a vote too. Those votes, and the amazing support you've > shown over the last year, is what matters to me.\\" This move was covered by many dance music blogs. Labels From 2003 to 2008, Gareth co-owned now defunct label Five AM under which some of his biggest hits from the time were released (Mistral / This Is That / More Than Anything). In late 2008 he left Five AM and started a new label called Garuda. The first Garuda release was his own record Exposure / Metropolis released in May 2009. Since then all Emery's records have been released through Garuda. It is named after the bird-like creature from Hindu and Buddhist mythology, which Emery became aware of whilst touring Indonesia. The label has released records by artists including Ben Gold, Tritonal, M.I.K.E. and Blake Jarrell. The label also runs occasional club nights. Guests have included Ferry Corsten, Markus Schulz, Above & Beyond (band) and Sander Van Doorn. Podcast and SiriusXM show Since March 2006, Emery has produced the 'Gareth Emery Podcast'. It has been nominated for \\"Best Podcast\\" at the Miami Winter Music Conference's International Dance Music Awards three times. In July 2012, Emery launched a syndicated radio show in North America called 'Gareth Emery Presents' on the SiriusXM channel Electric Area (Channel 52). The show is broadcast at 5pm ET Fridays with a repeat at 8pm ET Tuesdays. In November 2014, Emery announced that Episode 310 would be the final episode of the \\"Gareth Emery Podcast\\". He explained on social media: > \\"After doing the show more or less every week since 2006 I guess I'd become > a bit too comfortable, and I sometimes felt like I was producing the show on > auto pilot for the last year or so. Saying the same old  and playing the > same sounding music, and probably playing it a bit too safe, choosing the > obvious bangers and hot promos rather than pushing myself to dig out those > hidden gems like I always used to.\\" Emery then followed up with an announcement of a new podcast from his new SiriusXM show called \\"ELECTRIC FOR LIFE\\" In May 2015, Gareth Emery partnered with Electronic Music lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which the proceeds are donated to his charitable foundation, Electric For Life. Satire On 11 March 2016, Emery released single \\"CVNT5\\" together with Ashley Wallbridge. The \\"CVNT5\\" music video is a satirical view on careers of popular electronic dance music acts. The video featured two aspiring DJs played by Emery and Wallbridge who hoped to appear on the Forbes Highest-Paid DJs list. They climbed to international stardom by hiring a ghost-producer to create their songs and buying many Twitter followers, while dressing in ludicrous clothing and wigs. The song later appeared on Emery's third studio album 100 Reasons to Live. They released a second single on 19 March 2016 titled \\"They Don't Want Us To Win\\", which featured a sample from DJ Khaled saying \\"win\\" in the song's buildup. Wallbridge revealed that the project came to light during a drunken conversation in a pub, which purpose was to \\"have a laugh\\" and satirise the clich√©s in dance culture. The duo released a follow-up video through YouTube titled \\"DJ Mag Corruption Exposed: A CVNT5 Documentary\\" on 14 October 2016. The mockumentary showed CVNT5 continuing their attempt to reach number one on DJ Mag's annual Top 100 DJs list, notably by investing $50,000 into advertising, paying a black market Vietnamese click farm to generate votes, and bribing key figures in DJ Mag. CVNT5 ended up winning number two on the rankings albeit their efforts, likely due to another individual paying the magazine's Editor In Chief with a diamond-encrusted watch. Critics felt that the video served as criticism to DJ Mag's list; referring to the time in 2015 where DJs Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike won first place under suspicious circumstances, specifically by vote buying and having staff members walk around with iPads at their performing venues to secure extra votes. On 18 June 2018, American video streaming service go90 announced eight episodes of \\"We Are CVNT5\\", which will expand on the original CVNT5 mockumentary. The series was directed by Matt Enlow, written by Emery, Alex Madden and Geraint Jones, and featured Paul Holowaty, Taylor Misiak, Dillon Francis, and Pete Tong. The series was based heavily on Emery's musical experience during the United States' electronic dance music boom. A trailer for the series was released on 25 June 2018. Emery revealed through Facebook that the project encountered many issues during its production, including \\"tears\\", \\"screaming\\", and lawsuits, but managed to complete it in time. All eight episodes of \\"We Are CVNT5\\" were made available on 28 June 2018.  Electric For Life  Electric For Life is Gareth's new brand which replaced the eight year old Gareth Emery Podcast in November 2014. It is a radio show, live show, and charitable foundation. All proceeds from the Electric For a Life Foundation shows are donated to help vulnerable groups in society. The first show was a fundraiser for the Greater Vancouver Food Bank which raised $15,000. On 28 November 2015, Gareth hosted Electric For Life Day: a 24-hour live broadcast involving Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, W&W;, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz, Aly & Fila, Dash Berlin, Cosmic Gate and Seven Lions. During the show he hosted an Electric For Life stage at the Stereosonic festival in Sydney which featured performances of Andrew Rayel, MaRLo, Emma Hewitt, and Mark Sherry alongside Emery himself. Discography Gareth Emery's production aliases include GTR, Cupa, Digital Blues and a house project under the name Runaway.

McLaglen, written by Ian Kennedy Martin, and starring Joe Don Baker as an abrasive police detective. The film was released in the United States on September 10, 1975 by Allied Artists Pictures Corporation. Very much an anti-hero, Mitchell often ignores the orders of his superiors and demonstrates disdain for by-the- book development work as well as normal social graces. The film co-stars John Saxon and Martin Balsam as the banking criminals Mitchell pursues and Linda Evans and Merlin Olsen in supporting roles as a prostitute and henchman. The film had a resurgence after being featured in a season 5 episode of the comedy series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993. Plot A trade union lawyer named Walter Deaney (John Saxon) kills a burglar in his house. Only an unorthodox plainclothes detective named Mitchell (Joe Don Baker) believes that Deaney is guilty of something more than self-defense, but Chief of Police Albert Pallin (Robert Phillips) tells him that Deaney is wanted for \\"every federal law violation in the book\\" and is therefore \\"FBI property.\\" To keep Mitchell away from Deaney, the Chief orders him to stake out the home of James Arthur Cummins (Martin Balsam), a wealthy man with ties to the mob whose \\"big scene\\" is the import and export of stolen merchandise. Mitchell initially is unconcerned with Cummins and focuses primarily on Deaney. But he gets drawn in after Cummins discovers that Salvatore Mistretta (Morgan Paull), cousin of his mafioso benefactor Tony Gallano (Harold J. Stone), is bringing in a shipment of stolen heroin from Mexico without Cummins' approval. Meanwhile, a high- priced escort named Greta (Linda Evans) shows up at Mitchell's apartment. Mitchell allows her to come in, and after spending two nights with her and arresting her for possession of marijuana, he discovers that Deaney is paying her $1,000 per night to entertain Mitchell. After unsuccessfully trying to bribe Mitchell with Greta's services and an offer of an illicit real estate deal, Deaney decides to work with Cummins to eliminate the annoying cop. Deaney is killed shortly thereafter during an attempt on Mitchell's life. Cummins refuses to let Mistretta use his port facilities to bring in the shipment, causing Gallano to send thugs to harass him. Cummins decides that the only ally he still has‚Äîaside from his faithful butler and bodyguard, Benton (Merlin Olsen)‚Äîis Mitchell, because he's no good to the police dead. In exchange for his own freedom, Cummins offers to allow Mitchell to pose as a chauffeur and pick up the shipment, putting him in a position to both confiscate the drugs and arrest Mistretta. However, Cummins double-crosses Mitchell by alerting Mistretta to his real identity. He also double-crosses Mistretta by replacing the heroin with chalk. Mistretta decides to kill Mitchell and dump the body on Cummins' boat. Mistretta is killed in the subsequent gun battle, allowing Mitchell to go after Cummins, who is attempting to flee the country by sea. Mitchell is dropped onto the boat by helicopter and kills Benton with a gaff hook. Cummins is killed by a close- range shot from an assault rifle after one final attempted double-cross fails, bringing the central plot to a close. Mitchell returns to his apartment to find Greta awaiting him. Mitchell brushes her off, pointing out that she is no longer being paid to keep him company. Despite this, Greta wishes to spend the night with Mitchell. However, he detects the scent of marijuana on her and the film concludes on what is intended to be a humorous beat, as Mitchell prepares to haul Greta off to jail for a second possession charge. =Alternate version= In 1980, a heavily edited version of the 1975 film was released for broadcast television, in which most of the violence and all of the nudity and profanity were removed. Several scenes in the film were shot twice for this purpose. * Greta writes on the windshield of Mitchell's car with lipstick. In the theatrical release the word written on the windshield is \\"BASTARD\\" while in the TV version the word is \\"JERK.\\" * The sequence during the dinner scene with the phony argument between Cummins and Benton was also shot twice to substitute \\"goddamn awful butler\\" with \\"lousy butler\\". * The scene with Mitchell arguing with Greta's son was edited with Mitchell saying \\"Buzz off, kid!\\" in the TV version instead of \\"Piss off, kid!\\" in the theatrical release. His remark, \\"Go to Hell!\\", to Greta's son as he skateboards away was also censored. Critical reception Mitchell was generally panned by critics upon its release.

Satellite News. Retrieved on 2007-05-18. The film was trimmed by several minutes to match MST3K's format. This resulted in John Saxon's character, killed by Mitchell in a deleted scene, simply vanishing from the action. The only mention of his disappearance was a voiceover by a radio announcer stating that Saxon's character had died. Tom Servo remarks on this lapse with the question, \\"Hey, guys, wasn't John Saxon in this movie?\\" Particularly mocked were Mitchell's alcoholism, slovenliness and uncouth behavior. During the opening credits, Servo and Crow mock the theme song by improvising lyrics about food and Mitchell's weight, briefly referencing the theme song from Shaft. According to page 97 of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide, the cast had heard a rumor that actor Joe Don Baker was very angry at the MST3K treatment of Mitchell, and threatened physical violence on any of the cast or crew, should he ever meet them in person. This did not stop them from later featuring (and happily mocking) another of Baker's films, Final Justice, and hurling even more vicious insults at Baker.SEASON TEN: 1999. Satellite News. Retrieved on 2007-05-18. Kevin Murphy, who played MST3K's robot commentator Tom Servo, as well as serving as one of the show's writers, later said Baker likely meant it in a joking manner. Nevertheless, MST3K head writer and star Michael J. Nelson stated that he avoided running into Baker when he discovered that they were both staying at the same hotel. The episode is also notable for its host segment's subplot involving Gypsy, who overhears the Mads plotting to kill their new temp, Mike, and mistakenly thinks they are planning to kill Joel. Working with Mike, Gypsy locates an escape pod and uses it to \\"save\\" Joel's life, ending his imprisonment on the Satellite of Love. The Mads then abandon their plan to fire Mike, and instead send him to the SoL to replace Joel. The episode was chosen by fans to appear in the MST3K 2016 Turkey Day Marathon.

He was a teacher of halakha, judge, physician, and astronomer. He was born about 165 CE at Nehardea, and died there in 254 CE. In the Talmud, Samuel is frequently associated with Abba Arikha (\\"Rav\\"), with whom he debated on many issues. Biography =Birth= As in the case of many other great men, a number of legendary stories are connected with his birth.Compare Halakot Gedolot, Gi·π≠·π≠in, end; Tosafot Kiddushin 73a s.v. Mai Ikka His father, Abba bar Abba,Brachot 18b subsequently known also by the Aramaic language designation Abuh di-Shemu'el (\\"father of Samuel\\"), was a silk-merchant. R. Judah ben Bathyra ordered a silken garment from him, but refused to take it after Abba had procured it, and when the latter asked him the reason of his refusal, R. Judah answered, \\"The commission was only a spoken word, and was not sufficient to make the transaction binding.\\" Abba thereupon said, \\"Is the word of a sage not a better guarantee than his money?\\" \\"You are right,\\" said R. Judah; \\"and because you lay so much stress upon a given word you shall have the good fortune of having a son who shall be like the prophet Samuel, and whose word all Israel will recognize as true.\\" Soon afterward a son was born to Abba, whom he named Samuel.Midrash Shmuel, 10 [ed. Martin Buber, p. 39a] =Youth= Even as a boy Samuel displayed rare ability.Yerushalmi Ketuvim 5 30a; Yerushalmi Peah 8 21b His first teacher was an otherwise unknown man, and Samuel, who knew more about a certain legal question than did his teacher, would not submit to ill treatment by him.Hullin 107b Then Samuel's father, who was himself a prominent teacher of the Law, recognized as such even by Rav,Ketubot 51b undertook to instruct the boy. As he seems to have been unequal to this task he sent him to Nisibis to attend the school of the rabbi who had predicted the boy's birth, that he might there acquire a knowledge of the Law.\\"Tanya,\\" Hilkot \\"Abel,\\" ed. Horowitz, p. 137, quoted from Yerushalmi; comp. also Mordecai on Moed Kattan 889 Samuel seems to have remained only a short time at Nisibis. On his return to Nehardea he studied under Levi ben Sisi, who was in Babylonia before the death of Judah ha-Nasi,See A. Krochmal in \\"He-·∏§alutz\\" i. 69 and who exerted a great influence on Samuel's development. Samuel made such rapid progress and became so proficient in his studies that he soon associated as an equal with his teacher.Hoffmann, \\"Mar Samuel,\\" p. 70 =Training= Apart from the Bible and the traditional Law, which were usually the only subjects of study of the Jewish youth of that time, Samuel was instructed, probably in his early youth, in other sciences. It is likely that he accompanied his father on the latter's journey to Palestine;Yerushalmi Bava Metzia 4 9c; Yerushalmi Pesachim 5 32a for after his teacher Levi ben Sisi had gone to Palestine there was no one in Babylon with whom he could have studied. According to an account in the Talmud,Bava Metzia 85b; which Rapoport declares to be a later addition (\\"'Erek Millin,\\" pp. 10, 222), but which may have some basis in fact Samuel is said to have cured R. Judah haNasi of an eye disease. Although Samuel was at that time too young to study directly under R. Judah, he studied under the pupils of the patriarch, especially with Hanina bar Hama.compare Hoffmann, l.c. pp. 71‚Äì73; Fessler, \\"Mar Samuel, der Bedeutendste Amora,\\" p. 14, note 1 After having acquired a great store of knowledge in the Land of Israel, his studies there including the Mishnah edited by R. Judah haNasi as well as the other collections of tradition, Samuel left the Holy Land, probably with his father, and returned to his native city. His reputation as a teacher of the Law having preceded him, many pupils gathered about him. As he was especially well versed in civil law, the exilarch Mar Ukba, who was his pupil, appointed him judge of the bet din at Nehardea, where he was associated with his friend the learned and clever Karna. This court was regarded at that time as the foremost institution of its kind. In Palestine, as well as in Babylon, Samuel and Karna were called the \\"judges of the Diaspora\\" (dayyanei Golah).Sanhedrin 17b Upon the death of Rav Shela, the director of the Academy (\\"resh sidra\\") of Nehardea, Samuel was appointed to the office, after it had been refused by Rav, who would not accept any post of honor at Nehardea, Samuel's home.Letter of Sherira Gaon, in Neubauer, \\"M. J. C.\\" p. 28 The Academy of Nehardea entered upon a brilliant phase of its existence under Samuel's directorate, and, with the academy founded by Rav at Sura, enjoyed a high general reputation. =Precursor of the exilarch= Rav at Sura and Samuel at Nehardea established the intellectual independence of Babylonian Jewry. Young men taking up the study of the Law there were no longer obliged to go to Palestine, since they had the foremost teachers at home. Babylon now came to be regarded, in a sense, as a second Holy Land. Samuel taught, \\"As it is forbidden to migrate from Palestine to Babylon, so is it forbidden to migrate from Babylon to other countries\\".Ketubot 111a After Rav's death no new director was elected, and Rav's greatest pupil, R. Huna, who became president of the court of Sura, subordinated himself to Samuel in every respect, asking his decision in every difficult religio-legal question.Gittin 66b, 89b; compare Sanhedrin 17b; Tosafot ib., s.v., the phrase \\"be Rav\\" referring to R. Huna The Academy of Nehardea was now the only one in Babylon, and its director, Samuel, who survived Rav about ten years, was regarded as the highest authority by the Babylonian Jews. Even Rabbi Yochanan, the most prominent teacher in Palestine, and who at first looked upon Samuel merely as a colleague, became so convinced of his greatness, after Samuel had sent him a large number of responsa on important ritual laws, that he exclaimed, \\"I have a teacher in Babylon\\".Hullin 95b Samuel was unfortunate in his family life. He had no sons, and his two daughters were captured by soldiers during the war with the Romans. They were taken to Sepphoris, in Palestine, where they were ransomed by coreligionists, but both died at an early age after having been married successively to a relative.Ketubot 23a; Yerushalmi Ketubot 2 26c The esteem in which Samuel was held appears from the fact that no one thought of attributing his misfortune to any sin committed by him; it was explained rather as being in consequence of some offense committed in Babylon by R. Hananya, the nephew of R. Joshua.Yerushalmi Ketubot 2:8; compare Ketubot 23a After his death, Samuel was glorified in legend. He was the teacher of Rabbi Judah ben Ezekiel. Despite his status, Samuel was never ordained as a Tanna. Teachings Samuel amplified and expanded earlier legal theories and originated many new legal maxims. He formulated the important halakhic principle that \\"the law of the kingdom is [binding] law.Baba Kama 113b This principle made it a religious duty for the Jews to obey the laws of the country. Thus, although the Jews had their own civil courts, Samuel thought that the Persian law should be taken into account and that various Jewish regulations should be modified according to it.Bava Metzia 108a; Bava Batra 55a Due to his loyalty to the government and his friendship with the Sassanid king, Shapur I, Samuel was called Shabur Malka.Bava Batra 115b F√ºrst\\"Orient, Lit.\\" 1847, No. 3, p. 39 and Rapoportib. p. 196 refer, each differently, the name of Aryok, given to Samuel,Compare Shabbat 53a; Kiddushin 39a; Menachot 38b; Hullin 76b to his close relations with the Neo-Persians and their king. Older commentators explain this name without reference to such relations.Tosafot Shabbat 53a; Rashi ad loc.; compare Fessler, l.c. p. 9, note 1 As a man, Samuel was distinguished for his modesty, gentleness, and unselfishness, being always ready to subordinate his own interests to those of the community. He said: \\"A man may never exclude himself from the community, but must seek his welfare in that of society\\".Berakhot 49b He was known for being very precise with his words.Kiddushin 70 He demanded seemly behavior from every one, saying that any improper conduct was punishable by law.Hagigah 5a One should help one's fellow man at the first signs of approaching difficulties, so as to prevent them, and not wait until he is in actual distress.ibid. In his solicitude for helpless orphans he imposed upon every court the task of acting as father to them,Yebamot 67b; Gittin 37a, 52b and he declared that a loan taken from an orphan was not canceled in the Sabbatical year, even if no prozbul had been made out for it.Gittin 36b-37a He stored his grain until prices had risen, in order to sell it to the poor at the low prices of the harvest-time.Bava Batra 90b In order to save the people from being cheated he ordered the merchants never to take a profit of more than one-sixth of the cost price,Bava Metzia 40b and he was ready even to temporarily modify the Law in order to prevent them from selling at a high price goods necessary for the fulfillment of a religious duty.Pesachim 30a; Sukkah 34b In a certain case also he permitted the infraction of a religious prescription in order to keep people from harm.Shabbat 42a Samuel was very modest in his associations with others, openly honoring any one from whom he had gained any knowledge.Bava Metzia 33a He never obstinately insisted on his own opinion, but yielded as soon as he was convinced of being in error.Eruvin 90a,b; Hullin 76b; Berachot 36a He was friendly to all men, and declared: \\"It is forbidden to deceive any man, be he Jew or pagan\\".Hullin 94a \\"Before the throne of the Creator there is no difference between Jews and pagans, since there are many noble and virtuous among the latter\\".Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 1 57a He taught that the dignity of womanhood should be respected even in the slave: the slave is given to the master only as a servant, and the master has no right to treat her with condescensionNiddah 47a or to have marital relations in the presence of the slaves.Niddah 17a Once, when a female slave had been taken away from Samuel and he had unexpectedly recovered her by paying a ransom, he felt obliged to liberate her because he had given up hope of recovering her.Gittin 38a =Aggadah= Following the example of his teacher Levi ben Sisi, Samuel collected the traditions handed down to him. His collection of baraitot, called \\"Tanna debei Shemu'el\\" in the Talmud,Shabbat 54a; Eruvin 70b, 86a, 89b; Pesachim 3a, 39a,b; Beitzah 29a; Rosh Hashana 29b; Yoma 70a; Megillah 30a; Zevachim 22a was noted for its correctness and trustworthiness, although it was not held in such high esteem as were the collections of R. Hiyya and R. Hoshaiah.Letter of Sherira Gaon, l.c. p. 18 Samuel did much to elucidate the Mishnah, both by his textual explanationsShabbat 104b; Pesachim 119b; Gittin 67b; Bava Metzia 23b; Avodah Zarah 8b, 32a; Rosh Hashana 18a; Kiddushin 76b and by his precise paraphrasing of ambiguous expressions and his references to other traditions. He is chiefly important, however, because of his promulgation of new theories and his independent decisions both in ritual and in civil law. However, in the field of ritual law he was not considered as great an authority as his colleague Rav, and practical questions were always decided according to Rav's views as against those of Samuel.Niddah 24b; Bekhorot 49b In civil law his authority was the highest in Babylon, and his decisions became law even when contrary to Rav's.ibid. Scientific knowledge Samuel seems to have possessed a thorough knowledge of the science of medicine as it was known in his day; this is evident from many of his medical maxims and dietetic rules scattered through the Talmud. He energetically opposed the view then current, even in intelligent circles, that most diseases were due to the evil eye, declaring that the source of all disease must be sought in the noxious influence exercised by the air and the climate upon humans.Bava Metzia 107b He traced many diseases to lack of cleanliness,Shabbat 133b and others to disturbances of the regular mode of living.Bava Batra 146a He claimed to possess cures for most diseases,Bava Metzia 113b and was especially skillful in treating the eye;Bava Metzia 85b he discovered an eye-salve which was known as the \\"killurin [Œ∫ŒøŒªŒªœçœÅŒπŒøŒΩ] of Mar Samuel,\\" although he himself said that bathing the eyes with cold water in the morning and bathing hands and feet with warm water in the evening were better than all the eye-salves in the world.Shabbat 78a, 108b Samuel discovered also a number of the diseases of animals.Hullin 42b He sometimes drew the figure of a palm branch as his signature,Yerushalmi Gittin 9 50d although perhaps this was used by physicians generally at that time as a sign of their profession.Rapoport, \\"'Erek Millin,\\" p. 17 Samuel had a special affinity for astronomy. From the scattered references in the Talmud it is impossible to determine exactly his proficiency in astronomy; but he knew how to solve many mathematics problems and how to explain many phenomena. He says himself: \\"Although I am as familiar with the courses of the stars as with the streets of Nehardea, I cannot explain the nature or the movements of the comets\\".Berachot 58b Samuel devoted himself especially to that branch of applied astronomy that deals with calendric science, which he taught to his colleagues and pupils. His studies of the moon enabled him to predict the beginning of the month as it was determined in Palestine, and he claimed to be able to remove the necessity of celebrating double holy days in the Diaspora.Rosh Hashana 20b; compare Rashi ad loc. He also computed a Hebrew calendar for sixty years, which he subsequently sent to R. Johanan, the head of the Palestinian teachers, as a proof of his knowledge.Hullin 95b He was called \\"Yarkhina'ah\\" or \\"Yarkhinai\\" (Hebrew: ◊©◊û◊ï◊ê◊ú ◊ô◊®◊ó◊ô◊†◊ê◊î; \\"yerakh\\" = \\"month\\") because of this familiarity with calendric science and this ability to determine independently the beginning of the month.Bava Metzia 85b According to Krochmal\\"He-·∏§alutz\\" i. 76 \\"Sho·∏≥ed,\\" another name given to Samuel,Yerushalmi Ketubot 4 28b; for which Babli has \\"Shakud\\"; Ket. 43b means \\"astronomer\\". But Hoffmann's view that \\"Sho·∏≥ed\\" means \\"the watchful, diligent one\\" is more likely correct. This name is said to have been given to Samuel because, despite his medical and astronomic studies, he devoted himself to the study of the Law. Relations with the Persian court It was due to Mar Samuel's influence with the Persian king that the Jews were granted many privileges. On one occasion Samuel even made his love for his own people subsidiary to his loyalty to the Persian king and to his strict view of the duties of a citizen; for when the news came that the Persians, on capturing Mazaca, had killed 12,000 Jews who had obstinately opposed them, Samuel refrained from displaying any sorrow.Moed Kattan 26a It is worth noting that Samuel formulated the Talmudic dictum that \\"the law of the state is to be upheld\\" (). R' Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog disagrees with that interpretation. First, Samuel intended to demonstrate a Law not his emotions on the subject. Second, Samuel held that the Messianic Era would arrive through natural means. Samuel may have believed that King Shapur I was destined to usher in the 3rd temple era as Cyrus had been before him. Therefore those Jews who fought on the side of the Roman Emperor Julian were prolonging the exile and not worthy of being mourned.Pesakim uKetavim vol.2 But he had a great love for his people, and he loyally cherished the memory of the former kingdom of Judah. Once, when one of his contemporaries adorned himself with a crown of olive, Samuel sent him the following message: \\"The head of a Jew that now wears a crown while Jerusalem lies desolate, deserves to be separated from its trunk\\".Yerushalmi Sotah 9 24b,c Samuel declared that \\"There will be no difference between this world and the messianic age, except for [the ending of] subjugation [of Israel] to [foreign] kingdoms\\".Berachot 34b  Quotes  *Anyone who disqualifies another, does so in the very malady with which he, himself, is plagued!Kiddushin 70b References It has the following bibliography: *Heilprin, Seder ha-Dorot, ii. 350-352, Warsaw, 1878; *Weiss, Dor, iii. 161-176; *Ha-Asif, 1885, ii. 262-274; 1886, iii. 287-291, 333; *Halevy, Dorot ha-Rishonim, ii. 400-410; *Gr√§tz, Gesch. 3d ed., iv. 263 et seq., 270-272; *D.

His official debut as Fred's new voice was in the 1965 Hanna-Barbera record, Saving Mr. Flintstone, although he had previously provided the singing voice for Reed in the 1966 theatrical film The Man Called Flintstone and the Hanna-Barbera specials Alice in Wonderland or What's a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This? (1966) and Energy: A National Issue (1977). He took over the role as Fred Flintstone full time starting with the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends for which he provided voice-overs on brief bumper clips shown in-between segments. Early years Corden was born in Montreal to Max and Emma Cohen. His father was a meat curer who had been born in Romania; his mother was originally from Russia. The family moved to the Bronx, New York when Corden was a child and he arrived in Hollywood in the 1940s.  Career  He appeared on the stage in Los Angeles and Hollywood, including a 1947 production of The Message. His film career included The System (1952), where he played a near-sighted gangster named Specs. Corden thought it would be the first time in 25 films he could wear his glasses and see while he was acting, but the lenses gave off too much reflection and he had to substitute them for plain glass after one day of shooting.The Associated Press, quoted in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal, December 28, 1952. Corden's obituary in the Tampa Bay Times noted, \\"With his deep voice, jet-black hair and ethnic looks, Corden was frequently tapped to play heavies in films and on television.\\"[2] He can be seen in such live-action films as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The Black Castle, Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion and The Ten Commandments. He also appeared in dozens of TV shows, including Hogan's Heroes (in five episodes), Dragnet, Perry Mason, Peter Gunn, McHale's Navy (in five episodes), Gunsmoke, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and was a regular on The Jerry Lewis Show. Corden also played landlord Henry Babbitt on The Monkees and Mr. Haskell, the owner of an ice cream parlor, in an episode of The Brady Bunch. Before Reed's death, Corden had been used as Reed's replacement when Fred Flintstone had to sing because Reed could not sing on pitch. Corden gave his voice to a number of Hanna-Barbera productions besides The Flintstones, including The Jetsons, Josie and the Pussycats, The Atom Ant Show, The New Tom & Jerry Show and Jonny Quest. Corden also gave voice to the wizard Gemini and Ookla the Mokk in Ruby-Spears Productions' Thundarr the Barbarian as well as the Gorilla General Urko in DePatie-Freleng Enterprises' Return to the Planet of the Apes. He voiced Arnie Barkley, the Archie Bunker-inspired patriarch of DePatie-Freleng's The Barkleys, in 1972. Personal life Corden was married four times. His first wife was Thelma Corden, from 1942 to 1969; together they had two children. He and his second wife Shirley W. Cytron were married from 1970 to 1979. After his divorce from Cytron, he married his third wife Charlotte R. Colton Diamond in 1984; they remained married until her death in 1993. Corden married his fourth and final wife Angelina Corden in 1995, and they remained married until Corden's death in 2005. Death On May 19, 2005, Corden died of emphysema at Sherman Oaks Hospital in Sherman Oaks, California. He was 85 years old. Corden's wife of nine years, Angelina, was with him at the time. His interment was at San Fernando Mission Cemetery.

It is the third instalment in the Once Upon a Time in China film series. Plot The film is set in China in the late 19th century during the Qing dynasty when Chinese sovereignty is being eroded by foreign imperialism. Empress Dowager Cixi and Li Hongzhang decide to stage a lion dance competition to showcase Chinese martial arts and restore national pride. Interested parties from all over China are invited to participate and compete for the title of \\"Lion Dance King\\". Wong Fei-hung travels by train from Foshan to Beijing with his romantic interest 13th Aunt and apprentice Leung Foon to meet his father, Wong Kei- ying, at the Cantonese Ten Tigers Association. At the train station, 13th Aunt meets Tomanovsky, a Russian diplomat, who was her classmate when she was studying in Britain. He starts vying for her attention and annoys Wong, who is disgusted by the Western custom of kissing a woman's hand. When Wong reaches the Association, he learns that his father has been attacked by a wealthy rival martial artist, Chiu Tin-bak, and Chiu's henchman, Clubfoot. Luckily, the elder Wong sustained only minor injuries. Wong Kei-ying decides to give his blessings to his son and 13th Aunt when he sees their romantic relationship. Before the competition officially begins, all the lion dance troupes that have gathered in Beijing are already fighting among themselves and holding another competition of their own. Wong does not participate and spectates instead. Unknown to him, Leung and his friends have secretly joined the competition out of mischief. A short chase takes place between Clubfoot and Leung when the latter annoys the former during the contest and flees. Clubfoot's legs are crushed when Leung accidentally releases a stampede of horses from a stable. Chiu abandons Clubfoot when he sees that he is now a useless cripple. Wong takes pity on Clubfoot, brings him in, and heals his legs. Clubfoot is initially hostile towards Wong, but he feels so touched and grateful to Wong that he starts bawling emotionally, and becomes Wong's new apprentice. With the aid of a camera given to her by Tomanovsky, 13th Aunt inadvertently uncovers a plot to assassinate Li Hongzhang during the competition and learns that Tomanovsky is one of the conspirators. She warns Wong, who joins the contest to stop the assassins. In the final round of the competition, Wong, Leung and Clubfoot fight with dozens of rival lion dancers as they battle their way to the top of a scaffold. Chiu also joins the competition and carries a large and deadly lion mask. Wong ultimately defeats Chiu and wins the competition. In the meantime, Tomanovsky fails to assassinate Li Hongzhang and is shot dead by his fellow Russians, who claim to the Chinese that he was a spy working for the Japanese. Although Wong wins the prize (a gold medal), he remarks that it is ultimately a defeat for the Chinese because of all the infighting. He then tosses the medal back to Li Hongzhang, turns his back and walks away.

CU-SeeMe can make point to point video calls without a server or make multi-point calls through server software first called a \\"reflector\\" and later called a \\"conference server\\" or Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). Later commercial versions of CU-SeeMe could also make point-to-point or multi-point calls to other vendor's standards-based H.323 endpoints and servers.  History  Global Schoolhouse students communicating via CU-SeeMe Screen capture showing Global Schoolhouse classrooms collaborating via CU-SeeMe CU-SeeMe was originally written by Tim Dorcey of the Information Technology department at Cornell University.Cu-SeeMe article by Tim Dorcey in March 1995 Connexions It was first developed for the Macintosh in 1992 and later for the Windows platform in 1994. Originally it was video-only with audio added in 1994 for the Macintosh and 1995 for Windows. CU-SeeMe's audio came from Maven, an audio-only client developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.History of CU-SeeMe Project CU-SeeMe was introduced to the public on April 26, 1993 as part of an NSF funded education project called the Global Schoolhouse. \\"It is Not About the Technology\\" tells about Global SchoolNet's Global SchoolHouse Project using the first multi-point Internet-based video conferencing to connect schools in the United States and with schools worldwide. By sending video and audio signals over the Internet using CU-SeeMe software, students were able to see and hear each other while they worked on collaborative assignments. As part of the program they interacted with special guests, such as Vice President Al Gore, the anthropologist Jane Goodall, Senator Dianne Feinstein, and surgeon general C. Everett Koop. In July 1993 now defunct London cable channel Channel One Television used CU-SeeMe to simulcast its programme Digital World on the Internet, becoming the first UK television programme to broadcast live on the web. The programme was frame-grabbed every 2 frames using a macro written in Windows by duo Thibault & Rav. In 1994 WXYC used CU-SeeMe to simulcast its signal to the net and so became the world's first internet radio station.WXYC history On Thanksgiving morning in 1995, World News Now was the first television program to be broadcast live on the Internet, using a CU-SeeMe interface. Victor Dorff, a producer of WNN at the time, arranged to have the show simulcast on the Internet daily for a six-month trial period. CU-SeeMe was also used in a taped interview segment in which anchor Kevin Newman and Global Schoolhouse director and founder Dr. Yvonne Marie Andres discussed the future of computers in communication. In March 1996, CU-SeeMe was used for the first ever live internet broadcast of a musical theatre performance with the production of Cowboys in Love: The Hank Plowplucker Story. The show was produced by The Ethereal Mutt - Limited, and the stream was a partnership between Emutt and the CIS staff at Arizona State University. The Internet Phone Connection, written by Cheryl L. Kirk was one of the first consumers books to feature CuSeeMe. The book outlined how to use the program to communicate across the globe.  From freeware to commercial  CU-SeeMe 2.x was released as a commercial product in 1995 through an agreement with Cornell University. The full commercial licensing rights were transferred to White Pine Software in 1998.InternetNews.com December 2, 1998 White Pine Takes Ownership of CU-SeeMe  Decline  While not directly competing against hardware-assisted video-conferencing companies, it suffered in that the nascent market was expecting hardware quality audio and video when CPUs of that time weren't really ready to support that quality level in software. Early wide acceptance of CU-SeeMe outside of the hobbyist market was limited by its relatively poor audio/video quality and excessive latency. While the commercial and freeware products were useful to hobbyists, CU-SeeMe and its accompanying server product were beginning to build a following in education - with up to 40% of commercial sales from educational establishments. (A spinoff application called ClassPoint which was based on CU-SeeMe and the conference server was released commercially in 1998. It was an early attempt to add features to a real-time collaboration product specifically designed for K-20 education users.) The United States military was a large customer of the technology, making use of the CU-SeeMe Conference Server MCU for many applications, including using the T.120 server for Microsoft NetMeeting endpoints. White Pine locked out users of version 1.0 from using its free, public videoconferencing chatrooms. As users upgraded to the commercially available version, some were frustrated to discover that others were downloading the trial version and using software registration keys readily supplied by some participants on White Pine's public chatrooms.  Changing names and changing hands  White Pine Software was briefly renamed CUseeMe Networks, then merged with First Virtual Communications. The commercial standalone client was decommissioned (an independent company used a version of the embedded commercial CU-SeeMe client renamed \\"CU\\" as part of a fee-based video chat service called CUworld). The commercial client and server environment evolved further, was renamed \\"Click To Meet\\" and launched along with an enhanced and more scalable version of the software MCU. On March 15, 2005, Radvision Ltd. acquired all of the substantial assets and intellectual property of First Virtual Communications (FVC), including its 'Click to Meet' (formerly CUSeeMe) and Conference Server. Radvision was acquired by Avaya in June 2012. Spirent Communications acquired Radvision's Technology Business Unit from Avaya in July 2014.

Bruch completed the work in Liverpool, England, in 1880 and published it in Berlin in 1881. It was dedicated to and premiered by Robert Hausmann, who later co- premiered Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Joseph Joachim, the dedicatee of Bruch's most famous work, the Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor. Hausmann had requested such a cello work from Bruch. It is styled as an Adagio on 2 Hebrew Melodies for Cello and Orchestra with Harp and consists of a series of variations on two main themes of Jewish origin. The first theme, which also lends the piece its title, comes from the Kol Nidre declaration, which is recited during the evening service on Yom Kippur. In Bruch's setting of the melody, the cello imitates the rhapsodic voice of the cantor who chants the liturgy in the synagogue. The second subject of the piece is quoted from the middle section of Isaac Nathan's arrangement of \\"O Weep for Those that Wept on Babel's Stream\\", a lyric which was penned by Lord Byron in his collection Hebrew Melodies (which also includes the famous poem \\"She Walks in Beauty\\"). Bruch was a Protestant and first became acquainted with the Kol Nidrei melody when his teacher Ferdinand Hiller introduced him to the Lichtenstein family, the head of which served as the cantor-in-chief of Berlin. Cantor Abraham Jacob Lichtenstein was known to have cordial relations with many Christian musicians and supported Bruch's interest in Jewish folk music. While some commentators, including Abraham Zevi Idelsohn, have criticized the lack of Jewish sentiment in Bruch's concert-hall Kol Nidrei, Bruch never presumed to write Jewish music. He only wished to incorporate Jewish inspirations into his own compositions.Max Bruch, Kol Nidrei chazzanut.com, accessed 9 June 2019 The work is scored for solo cello, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, harp and strings.

While visually distinct, Apollo is cast in the mould of the Superman archetype. Apollo is notable for being among the first openly gay superheroes in print, although several years behind Marvel Comics' Northstar.Emmet Furey, \\"Homosexuality in Comics ‚Äì Part I\\" Comic Book Resources, 16 July 2007 He married fellow The Authority member Midnighter and both adopted Jenny Quantum.  Fictional character history  = Stormwatch = Warren Ellis introduced the character shortly after taking over writing duties on the Stormwatch title, when he had Apollo and Midnighter encounter the then-active Stormwatch team. The story was set in 1998, immediately after Bendix's fall, when Christine Trelane had cracked Bendix's old files and discovered evidence that two rogue former Bendix agents remained alive. In flashbacks, Apollo was introduced as a member of a \\"black ops\\" Stormwatch team so secret that no one but the first Weatherman, Henry Bendix, knew of its existence. Apollo's solar- powered abilities‚Äîincluding super-strength, heat vision, and a high degree of invulnerability‚Äîwere presented as the consequence of Bendix's bioengineering. The first story arc (collected in the Stormwatch trade paperback A Finer World) described how, of the seven-member team, only Apollo and Midnighter survived, going rogue after their first Stormwatch Black mission and spending five years undercover fighting for a finer world in the alleyways of America. Jackson King intercepted them on a mission to seize weapons made in the \\"Nevada Garden\\", a leftover of the first Engineer. He ordered Fahrenheit and Hellstrike to tag them with fetishes so they could be transported into SkyWatch. At first Apollo and Midnighter attacked the Stormwatch team, believing them under Bendix's orders. However, they ceased the attack once they were told Bendix was dead. With King's help, they destroyed the Nevada Garden, and Trelane gave them new lives away from Stormwatch. = The Authority (vol. 1) = In 1999, when Warren Ellis concluded his run on Stormwatch with the Final Orbit storyline which saw the team destroyed, Apollo was one of several Stormwatch characters he retained for his new Wildstorm title, The Authority. In it, Apollo (along with Midnighter) was recruited by Jenny Sparks for a new team, the Authority, under her leadership. The new series picked up themes Ellis had explored in Stormwatch, including the political potential of a team more powerful than world governments and the United Nations. Apollo featured prominently in early story arcs, producing a miles-long wall of flame to contain super clones attacking London, rescuing civilians from disaster zones, and shooting down invaders from a parallel universe. In The Authority #10, Apollo sterilised the moon, killing the alien parasites that were using it as a base from which to attack Earth. He formed a friendship with leader Jenny Sparks, and his relationship with Midnighter was revealed in The Authority #8, written by Warren Ellis. For the portrayal of Apollo and Midnighter, the Authority received a GLAAD award. The fourth Authority story arc saw Jenny Sparks die with the end of the 20th century and the Authority join a battle with U.S. government-backed superhumans to secure custody of her successor, Jennifer Quantum, the infant spirit of the 21st century. During this battle, Apollo was severely beaten by Storm God, a Thor pastiche, and The Commander, a Captain America pastiche. In one of author Mark Millar's most controversial scenes, it was implied that the beating was followed by a rape (The Authority #14). The rape was followed by a scene of revenge, in which it is implied that Midnighter raped the Commander with a jackhammer. In another Millar-penned story, the Authority faced a rogue Doctor, intent on planetary destruction. Though this Doctor ultimately repented of his crimes, Apollo killed him with his eye-beams. Apollo featured also in the Transfer of Power storyline, in which the Authority was defeated, captured and usurped by sadistic, government-controlled replacements. Apollo was kept aboard the Carrier and brutalised by Midnighter's and his own replacements. The latter tried to rape Apollo before the real Midnighter returned to kill Apollo's assailant. Apollo himself then burned the head off Midnighter's replacement, later doing the same to the Machine, who had taken the powers of the Engineer. Apollo and Midnighter were married and adopted Jenny Quantum at the end of Millar's run. From this point on, Apollo is referred to as Midnighter's husband, and vice versa. = The Authority (vol. 2) = Apollo received comparatively little attention during this volume, although his friendship with the Engineer was developed and the two became confidants. = Human on the Inside = In this standalone graphic novel, the U.S. President ordered an assault on the Authority which saw them nearly defeated by doubts, depression and human foibles. Each team member's weakness was exploited; in Apollo's case this appeared to be jealousy in his relationship with Midnighter, who confessed to Apollo that he had kissed another man. Apollo, enraged, hit Midnighter hard enough to knock him through several walls. This scene remains the only canonical indication of violence between the two. = Authority: Coup D'Etat and Authority: Revolution = Authority: Coup D'√âtat was a Wildstorm universe crossover event, in which‚Äîfollowing a deadly mistake by U.S. leaders‚ÄîAuthority team leader Jack Hawksmoor decided to remove the U.S. executive branch and have the Authority itself run the country. The takeover went smoothly, but the occupation did not go as planned. Shadowy forces intervened to destroy the Authority and put corporate interests back in power. Apollo's part in the story involved traveling with Midnighter to raid the base of Stormwatch: Team Achilles. They arrived to find it booby-trapped. After narrowly escaping with their lives, their next mission was to eliminate the U.S. military's superhuman training camp. Midnighter returned with the declaration that the program was \\"not so special.\\" In Authority: Revolution, a 12-part series by Ed Brubaker and Dustin Nguyen, Apollo was left to raise Jenny Quantum alone for three years after Midnighter, having received a sinister revelation about the future, left the Authority. The story described the break-up of the Authority after a humiliating nuclear incident destroys Washington D.C., precipitating the break-up of the team. The story turned on Jenny Quantum's decision, at age eight, to reform the team. To Apollo's initial horror she caused herself to jump in age to 14 years; after convincing him to support her, she set about rounding up the surviving members of the Authority, including Midnighter. In a painful moment between Jenny, Apollo and Midnighter, Jenny described herself to Midnighter as \\"the product of a broken home.\\" In the battle that followed, it became clear that Henry Bendix had gained control over Midnighter through a Trojan Horse strategy which delivered nanites into Midnighter's body. Midnighter fought with Jenny and then Apollo, regaining clarity for just long enough to beg Apollo to kill him if he got the chance. Apollo refused and was defeated, but Jenny was able to engage Midnighter for long enough for the Engineer to remove the mind-control implants and restore Midnighter. = Earth-50 = In 2006‚Äì2007, DC Comics's year-long weekly limited series, 52, identified the Wildstorm Universe as part of the DC Multiverse. Apollo, along with other Authority characters, appeared in several DC Universe titles as part of the crossover comics that followed, including in the 2007 series Countdown: Arena, where he is shown as the closest \\"Earth-50\\" (Wildstorm Universe) approximation of DC Comics (and formerly Quality Comics) character the Ray, who is a member of the Freedom Fighters, and, as such, is also a counterpart of several other alternate versions of the Ray. However, Apollo is also traditionally viewed as a Superman analogue. Countdown: Arena writer Keith Champagne described the Ray-Apollo relationship on his blog: :\\"Because Majestic is more or less the Superman analogue from Wildstorm. Of all the Wildstorm characters, I wanted Apollo in the book and, with Superman spoken for, the best match we could come up with was The Ray due to the solar-powered connection. It doesn't necessarily mean Apollo is a Ray analogue, just that Monarch grouped him together with the other two.\\"Champagne Wishes 2.0: Arena #2 Blogger.com Final Crisis #7 depicts Apollo and Mister Majestic as both being legitimate Superman analogues for their Earth. = World's End = The 2008 Number of the Beast Wildstorm miniseries described the devastation of Earth and set the scene for a new Authority ongoing series, World's End, by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. In this series, Apollo is separated from Midnighter and the rest of the Authority when a thick layer of smog covers the Earth, preventing sunlight from reaching the surface. Apollo is forced to remain in the photosphere to absorb the radiation he needs to survive, visiting the surface only briefly to help the team. While on the surface, environmental conditions sap his powers, giving him a gaunt appearance and limiting his ability to fight. He is later infected by the Warhol Fever, a superpower-inducing virus, that evolves and becomes sentient by incubating in his body. Claiming to be The Burn, the virus overrides his mind and attempts to escape into The Bleed. The Authority is forced to put Apollo in suspended animation, frozen and in an anaerobic room to keep the infection from spreading. He is eventually cured when Midnighter feeds him a piece of fruit he receives from the Century Baby, Gaia Rothstein. When the Authority reorganises and takes the Carrier into space, Apollo elects to stay on Earth, as he might be powerless during extended space travel. Midnighter stays with him. =The New 52= Following the events of Flashpoint, the Wildstorm universe is merged with the DC Universe, creating new backstories for many characters.Flashpoint (vol. 3) #1 (September 2011) Along with 51 other titles, Stormwatch relaunched with an issue #1 as part of DC's The New 52 company-wide revamp. In the new universe, Apollo starts off as a superpowered young man who first comes to the attention of Stormwatch after he uses his abilities to murder a child molester. Subsequently, a website uses Photoshop to create an image of Apollo battling Superman, the idea of which ultimately convinces Stormwatch to recruit him. Jack Hawksmoor, the Projectionist, and the Martian Manhunter hunt down Apollo and attempt to recruit him into the team, but he refuses, and a fight ensues. Just as he is overpowered, Midnighter arrives and defeats the Stormwatch members and then proposes a partnership between himself and Apollo.Stormwatch (vol. 3) #1 (September 2011) He and Midnighter gradually realise they are attracted to one another over the course of 18 issues, before DC restored its pre-reboot characterisations and designs for Midnighter and Apollo in its March 2013 Stormwatch #19. It then restored them to the original New 52 designs with the series' final issue, Stormwatch #30, in preparation for DC's The New 52: Futures End comic series, which is set to heavily feature former Wildstorm characters. Vaguely remembering a few weeks in an \\"alternate timeline\\" (Stormwatch #19-29), Apollo and Midnighter are nevertheless now a couple again, and Jenny Quantum is a team member again. Beginning with the new Midnighter series of 2015, Apollo and Midnighter are no longer a couple, due to conflicts over Midnighter's violent nature. They remain friends, however, with Midnighter sending Apollo a photo of himself as a boy when he discovers a file on his secret origin. =DC Rebirth= The character appears again along with his boyfriend, Midnighter, for a six-issue miniseries titled Midnighter and Apollo, continuing in the New 52 canon. Midnighter and Apollo have gotten back together as a couple. Apollo is attacked and his soul trapped in a hell dimension where he is detained by Neron.Midnighter and Apollo #1-6 (December 2016-May 2017) Writer Steve Orlando told The Advocate that \\"I would say I feel pressure to showcase a realistic relationship, and that means neither an unattainable, idealized vision or an overly dysfunctional one. Real relationships are work, and I want to treat Midnighter and Apollo with the same respect, passion, and intricacy we all deal with in our own relationships on a daily basis.\\" Powers and abilities Apollo's powers include superhuman strength, flight, and near invulnerability (the character has been shown entering a lava flow to deactivate a volcano, and walking on the surface of the sun). His eyes are constructed to concentrate solar energy into laser-like blasts. Apollo can also release his solar energy from other parts of his body (hands, mouth, etc.) or in an omnidirectional flare, but these moves are taxing. He can fly as well, at least fast enough to circle the globe in just under 30 seconds. Like Superman, Apollo's powers are dependent on the sun. His body behaves like a battery, absorbing sunlight and converting it into energy he can use. Without exposure to the sun his strength, resilience, and ability to fly diminish, ultimately to the point of disappearing‚Äîa concern, since aboard the Carrier he is often out of direct sunlight. From the point of exhaustion, he can regain the capacity for flight from 20 seconds of sun exposure. Two hours in sunlight restores him to full capacity. Transporting (using the Carrier's 'Door' system) into close proximity with the sun allows him to recharge more quickly. Since Apollo's energy derives entirely from the sun, he can survive in anaerobic environments indefinitely. He was shown in early issues of The Authority flying without protective equipment in space, explaining he could do so by the simple method of not breathing. He also does not require food or drink, though he apparently enjoys both. Apollo has been described a number of times as a Majestic-class superhuman, suggesting that his powers are near the level of Mister Majestic, or are at least similarly beyond the frame of reference of most superhumans. In The New 52: Futures End #4, Apollo is described by Father Time as a \\"Superman-level\\" superhuman.The New 52: Futures End #4 (2014) Alternative versions =Wildstorm Winter Special 2005= In Wildstorm Winter Special 2005, a story called Apollo & Midnighter: Two Dangerous Ideas features their alternate reality analogues, Pluto and Daylighter, with inverted color schemes to match. At first the real Midnighter believed that Daylighter was homophobic, but later learned that Pluto and Daylighter were a former couple that had broken up. =Gen¬π¬≥= In Gen¬π¬≥ vol. 4 #11 (written by Gail Simone), a teenage version of Apollo is a part of a team called \\"The Authori-teens\\" named Kid Apollo in the town of Tranquility, a fictional town in California. He and the teenage Midnighter, Daybreaker, would not appear to be out of the closet, although their romantic feelings for one another are still apparent. =Midnighter= In Midnighter #6, an alternate universe single-issue story set in feudal Japan, Apollo appeared as a peaceable but skillful swordsman and lover of a samurai Midnighter. =Flashpoint= In the Flashpoint reality, Neil Sinclair volunteered for a government supersoldier program, as the government was looking to create \\"the hero of tomorrow\\". The government grafts Project Six DNA to Sinclair and, over time, he gains numerous superpowers. When his powers begin to get out of hand, he is locked away deep in a government bunker. He keeps the rest of his powers a secret and uses his X-ray vision to see through the bunker. Kal-El is later confined to the bunker when his rocket crashes into Metropolis.Flashpoint: Project Superman #1 (June 2011) Sinclair telepathically mentors young Kal as he grows up. This eventually culminates in Kal setting Neil free. By this time, he has grown to great size. Sinclair goes on a rampage throughout the facility, eventually reaching Sam Lane's office. There he finds a young Lois Lane. He wishes to kill her as revenge for his confinement, but is opposed by Kal. Sam Lane appears with a Phantom Zone gun and he and Sam are sent into the Phantom Zone.Flashpoint: Project Superman #2 (July 2011) Years later, Sinclair is freed from the Phantom Zone and kills Sam Lane. Sinclair absorbs Project Six's corpse to regain his powers. Sinclair then located Kal-El and Lois in western Europe and attacks them. During the fight with Kal-El and him, Sinclair's energy body is overloaded. Kal-El punches through Sinclair's chest, which destroys him.Flashpoint: Project Superman #3 (August 2011) See also * LGBT themes in comics References External links * The Apollo action figure * Apollo character writeup * The Authority team member listings * Reaction to the \\"Nativity\\" storyline * Interview with Mark Millar on the Apollo rape scene Category:Characters created by Warren Ellis Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998 Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:Fictional gay males Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:DC Comics LGBT superheroes Category:Stormwatch and the Authority characters Category:Characters created by Bryan Hitch ","title":"Apollo (comics)"},{"id":"1971592","text":"View of Megalong Valley from near Nellies Glen on the Six Foot Track. The cliffs on the left are part of Peckmans Plateau (on the SW outskirts of Katoomba); those on the right, part of Radiata Plateau. The Megalong Valley is part of the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is located west of Katoomba. On its eastern side, the valley is separated from the Jamison Valley by Narrow Neck Plateau. The Shipley Plateau overlooks part of the valley. Description and History Looking from Megalong Head, across the north-western section of Megalong Valley The name Megalong Valley is derived from an Aboriginal word thought to mean 'Valley Under The Rock'. The first record of a European coming to the valley was of Thomas Jones, a natural history specimen collector, who followed the course of Coxs River from Hartley, New South Wales to Burragorang in 1818. The first land was taken up in 1838, by settlers who travelled from Burragorang and Camden, New South Wales. Later in the 19th century, a shale mine was operated by one J.B.North. He named a nearby glen after his daughter Nellie and it is still known as Nellies Glen today.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.243 The shale mine eventually went the way of all shale mines because they were not viable in the long run. Today the valley is still used for farming, but tourism has increased since the historic Six Foot Track was restored. This track was marked out in the 19th century as a bridle trail from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves. It was called the Six Foot Track because it had to be that wide in order to accommodate two to three riders riding abreast. It fell into disuse eventually but was restored as a walking trail by the Department of Lands in 1984. It begins at the Explorers Tree at Katoomba, goes down through Nellies Glen and across the Megalong Valley to Coxs River. On the other side of the river, the trail crosses some ranges before reaching Jenolan Caves Road. It then heads south to finish at Jenolan.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, pp.240-245 See also *List of valleys of Australia References Category:Geography of the Blue Mountains (New South Wales) ","title":"Megalong Valley"},{"id":"1971595","text":"Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a network protocol that is used to detect faults between two forwarding engines connected by a link. It provides low-overhead detection of faults even on physical media that doesn't support failure detection of any kind, such as Ethernet, virtual circuits, tunnels and MPLS Label Switched Paths. BFD establishes a session between two endpoints over a particular link. If more than one link exists between two systems, multiple BFD sessions may be established to monitor each one of them. The session is established with a three-way handshake, and is torn down the same way. Authentication may be enabled on the session. A choice of simple password, MD5 or SHA1 authentication is available. BFD does not have a discovery mechanism; sessions must be explicitly configured between endpoints. BFD may be used on many different underlying transport mechanisms and layers, and operates independently of all of these. Therefore, it needs to be encapsulated by whatever transport it uses. For example, monitoring MPLS LSPs involves piggybacking session establishment on LSP-Ping packets. Protocols that support some form of adjacency setup, such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP or RIP may also be used to bootstrap a BFD session. These protocols may then use BFD to receive faster notification of failing links than would normally be possible using the protocol's own keepalive mechanism. A session may operate in one of two modes: asynchronous mode and demand mode. In asynchronous mode, both endpoints periodically send Hello packets to each other. If a number of those packets are not received, the session is considered down. In demand mode, no Hello packets are exchanged after the session is established; it is assumed that the endpoints have another way to verify connectivity to each other, perhaps on the underlying physical layer. However, either host may still send Hello packets if needed. Regardless of which mode is in use, either endpoint may also initiate an Echo function. When this function is active, a stream of Echo packets is sent, and the other endpoint then sends these back to the sender via its forwarding plane. This is used to test the forwarding path on the remote system. Standardization In June 2011 the BFD protocol standardization process entered the Proposed Standard stage. RFC 5880 defines the BFD protocol,RFC 5880, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, D. Katz, D. Ward (June 2010) detecting MPLS LSP failure, using BFD to monitor connectivity across multiple network hops, and using BFD for IPv4 and IPv6.

History  Bentheim-Tecklenburg emerged as a partition of the County of Bentheim in 1277, and was partitioned between itself and Bentheim-Lingen in 1450. Count Conrad converted his county to Lutheranism in 1541. In 1557, it was inherited by Bentheim-Steinfurt. Arnold III, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt-Tecklenburg-Limburg (1554-1606) Arnold III, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt-Tecklenburg-Limburg (1554-1606) held the counties of Bentheim, Tecklenburg, Steinfurt, Limburg (with Hohenlimburg Castle), the Lordship of Rheda, possessions on the Lower Rhine and bailiff rights in the Archbishopric of Cologne. After his death his possessions were divided between his three eldest sons while the younger sons received lands from their mother. Adolf (1577-1623) received Tecklenburg and Rheda, Wilhelm Heinrich (1584-1632) Steinfurt (with Burgsteinfurt Castle), but left no offspring, Konrad Gumprecht (1585-1618) received Limburg, but his only son died early. Adolf had four sons of whom Moritz (1615-1674) inherited Tecklenburg and Rheda in 1623 and Limburg in 1629. Moritz' two sons Johann Adolf (1637-1704) and Friedrich Moritz (1653-1710) partitioned the territories again, but in 1701 Brandenburgian troops occupied Tecklenburg, as there had been a dispute about the county with the counts of Solms-Braunfels since 1577, and the latter sold their rights to Brandenburg. After the loss of Tecklenburg, the family still ruled in Limburg and Rheda, however about 100 kilometers apart from each other. In 1756 the residence was moved from Hohenlimburg to Rheda, which remains the main seat of the family to this day. In 1803 the secularized monasteries of Herzebrock and Clarholz, both located within the territories, were taken over by the counts. However, their sovereignty ended with the mediatisation in 1808 when the county became part of the Grand Duchy of Berg, and after the Congress of Vienna (1815) of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1817, the count was created 1st Prince of Bentheim-Tecklenburg and Rheda by the Prussian king. In 1854 he received a hereditary seat in the Prussian House of Lords. The castles of Hohenlimburg and Rheda and the abbeys of Herzebrock and Clarholz are still today owned by the House of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda.

The cartoon was directed by Tex Avery, written by Michael Maltese, animated by soon-to-be director Bob McKimson, and with musical direction by Carl Stalling. In a style that was becoming typical of the Bugs character, he easily outwitted and tormented his antagonist through the short, his only concern being what to do next to the dog. This is the second-to-last Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Tex Avery to be released following a dispute with producer Leon Schlesinger during production (see \\"Original Ending\\" below). The last, All This and Rabbit Stew, was produced before this film. Additionally, it was the fifth cartoon for Bugs and the 55th cartoon Avery directed at Warner Bros. The Merrie Melodies opening sequence also featured the first usage of the Warner Bros. shield logo zooming in with a carrot-munching Bugs Bunny lying on top of it. Here, after the zoom-in and a couple of bites of his carrot, Bugs pulls down the Merrie Melodies title screen like it is a shade. Plot Instead of Elmer Fudd, Bugs is hunted by a dog named Willoughby, but the dog falls for every trap Bugs sets for him until they both fall off a cliff at the end. Availability This cartoon appears in restored form on the DVD Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2. It is also included, unrestored, on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 as part of the 1990 TV special What's Up Doc? A Salute to Bugs Bunny. Original ending This is the cartoon that led to Avery leaving Warner Bros. and moving to MGM. The final gag of this cartoon originally had Bugs and Willoughby falling off three cliffs, with Bugs telling the audience after the second tumble, \\"Hold on to your hats, folks. Here we go again!\\" during the third trip down. Schlesinger intervened for reasons that are not known with certainty. The most popular story is that the \\"Hold on to your hats\\" line referred to a euphemism that was then in circulation; Rationale of the Dirty Joke another story is that Schlesinger feared that Tex Avery had killed off Bugs Bunny by ending the cartoon with Bugs and Willoughby falling off the second cliff without a clear indication of whether or not the two survived. According to Martha Sigall, Schlesinger found the second fall to be repetitious and objected to its inclusion on those grounds. He instructed Avery to cut it, but Avery insisted that it should remain. Schlesinger simply overruled him as the boss.Sigall (2005), p. 49 Karl F. Cohen suggests that Schlesinger found inappropriate an ending which suggests that Bugs gets killed.Cohen (2004), p. 39 From Schlesinger's point of view the dispute was over his right to do as he pleased with the films he was paying for. From Avery's point of view, the dispute was over artistic interference.Cohen (2004), p. 39 The film was edited so that the characters only fall off a cliff once. After Bugs and Willoughby fall through the sky in a lengthy sequence, they \\"put on the brakes\\" and make a soft, feet-first landing on the ground. Bugs says to the audience, \\"N'yah, fooled you, didn't we?!\\" The dog follows with, \\"Yeah!\\" just as the cartoon fades out. Willoughby's line and the fade out to the end card are usually cut in TV versions (mostly those shown on the Ted Turner-owned cable networks TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang) to cover up the fact that the cartoon had been edited in such an abrupt manner prior to release in theaters. Avery was angry, and walked out of the studio. He was promptly suspended for four weeks with no pay. On April 2, 1941, the quarrel was reported in an article for The Hollywood Reporter.Cohen (2004), p. 39 During his suspension, Avery was hired by MGM. A similar line had been allowed in Daffy Duck and Egghead (1938, coincidentally also directed by Avery). Just before launching into his own take on The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down, Daffy Duck tells the audience, \\"Hold your seats, folks, here we go again!\\" Daffy also says \\"Here we go again!\\" at the end of \\"Along Came Daffy\\" (1947).

Background  The city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, hired Cherokee Disposal to dispose of the city's waste. The city built a disposal site 20 feet from a stream which, when filled by the disposal company, resulted in waste seeping into the stream. The city was charged with discharging, or permitting to be discharged, refuse into the public waterways causing pollution pursuant to section 32(1) of the Ontario Water Resources Act. The issue before the court was whether the city's offence should be classified as strict liability or absolute liability. The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the charge required proof of mens rea, which on the facts would acquit the defendant.  Reasoning  In the judgement written by Justice Dickson, the Court recognized three categories of offences: # True Crimes: Offences that require some state of mind (mens rea) as an element of the crime. These offences are usually implied by the use of language within the charge such as \\"knowingly\\", \\"willfully\\", or \\"intentionally\\". # Strict Liability: Offences that do not require the proof of mens rea. The act alone is punishable. The duty is on the accused to have acted as a reasonable person and has a defence of reasonable mistake of fact (a due diligence defence). The Court stated that the due diligence defence \\"will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event. These offences may properly be called offences of strict liability.\\" The reason for this is that the Court described a need for a class of offence that had a lower standard to convict than True Crimes but was not as harsh as Absolute Liability offences. As opposed to the first category of offences in which the accused is presumed innocent, offences of strict liability presses a presumption of negligence on the accused. The burden of proving that the accused acted as a diligent person rests on his shoulders and must be demonstrated by preponderance of evidence. # Absolute Liability: Similar to Strict Liability, these offences do not require proof of mens rea either. However, the accused has no defences available. To distinguish between these types the Court examines: :[t]he overall regulatory pattern adopted by the legislature, the subject matter of the legislation, the importance of the penalty and the precision of the language used will be primary considerations in determining whether the offence falls into the third category. The Court then noted that the dumping offences were of a public welfare nature and were from a provincial statute, thus, were Strict Liability offences and do not require mens rea.

Traditionally entirely occupied by the Kaurna (indigenous) people, the Adelaide Plains are crossed by a number of rivers and creeks, but several dry up during summer. The rivers (from south to north) include: the Onkaparinga/Ngangki, Sturt/Warri Torrens/Karra Wirra, Little Para, Gawler, Light/Yarralinka and Wakefield/Undalya. The plains are generally fertile with annual rainfall of about per year. The plain can be roughly divided into three parts.

Process  The process involved pouring hot pitch, or tar (mainly used at the time for water proofing seams in the sides of ships and boats), into a conical shaped paper \\"cap\\", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head, allowed to cool, then rapidly removed, taking with it a portion of the suspect's skin and tissue. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by Myles Byrne in his memoirs. \\"Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked. \\"Memoirs of Miles Byrne The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembled scalping. In another form of torture, pitch could also be poured into a victim's orifices. However, doing so invariably proved fatal, and was therefore more suitable as a form of execution. Dating back to antiquity, this method often involved other hot liquids, even molten metal such as gold (which was used by Mithridates VI of Pontus to execute Roman consul Manius Aqullius in 88 BC. It was also rumoured that the triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus was executed in this way by the Parthians after losing the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, but this probably happened after his death.

The stadium existed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the park's heyday, the location was considered to be within Allegheny City, but in 1907, the entire municipality was annexed by its larger neighbor and eventually became Pittsburgh's North Side. The field was the first National League home for the Pittsburgh Pirates (at the time referred to as the Alleghenys) of Major League Baseball. It also hosted many football games of the University of Pittsburgh (at the time referred to as the Western University of Pennsylvania). In November 1892, the park was the location of the first known American football game that included a professional player. The park left a scant pictorial record. Only one known photograph, taken from a very distant vantage point, shows the grounds in its longtime baseball configuration. It was discovered in 2015 in a time capsule left by scientific instrument maker John Brashear. A much-altered facility appears in later photos, including several newspaper shots of football games. History Opened in 1865 as a skating center, the park was adapted for baseball use in 1867. Known prior to 1885 as Union Park, the stadium had an early capacity of 2,500, and was later expanded with wooden grandstands to allow up to 17,000 spectators. After the Alleghenys moved a few blocks south in 1890, the main tenant became the Allegheny Athletic Association, and the grounds would eventually be referred to as 3A Park. After the turn of the 20th century, it was converted to a velodrome called the Coliseum. The park was located within the blocks of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and Grant (now Galveston) Avenues and Boquet (now Behan) Street. In 2001, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pirates built stadiums not far from this site. =Baseball= In the late 1860s and early 70s, no less than three local amateur baseball teams‚Äîthe Enterprise Club, the Xanthas, and the Olympics‚Äîcompeted, most often at Union Park. In 1876 a professional Allegheny club played its first game against the Xantha club at Union Park, winning 7-3. This club lasted for three years, playing mostly other squads from the northeast within the International Association, but occasionally taking on National League teams in exhibition games. One long remembered match took place in early May, 1877, when Pud Galvin both threw a shutout and hit a home run for the only score in a 1-0 game against the Boston Red Stockings. The 1882-organized Pittsburgh Alleghenys of the American Association moved from Exposition Park II to Union Park in 1884. The team posted a record of 18‚Äì37 at home that season, finishing 11th in the league. In 1887, owner William A. Nimick transferred the club into the National League, and on April 30, the Alleghenies defeated the Chicago White Stockings, 6‚Äì2 in front of 10,000 spectators. This was the first officially recognized contest of the Pittsburgh Pirates franchise by the team. Legend has it that, prior to that opening game of the 1887 season, Pittsburgh's catcher Fred Carroll buried his pet monkey beneath home plate. Also during that season, a local businessman by the name of Walter Brown organized what would be an early attempt of a league for black ball players, with his Pittsburgh Keystones taking up residence at the park. In 1891, after the collapse of the Pittsburgh Burghers baseball franchise and the Players' League, the Alleghenys moved to the third incarnation of Exposition Park, which had been constructed for the Burghers. 1899 WUP team at Recreation Park =Football= On November 12, 1892, the Allegheny Athletic Association football team hosted a game here against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The Allegheny Athletic Association won the game, which was the first in professional football. The team had hired Pudge Heffelfinger, an all-American guard from Yale, for $500.The Birth of Pro Football Pro Football Researchers Association Decades later the Pro Football Hall of Fame discovered a page torn from an 1892 account ledger prepared by Allegheny manager, O. D. Thompson, that included the line item: \\"Game performance bonus to W. Heffelfinger for playing (cash) $500.\\"National Football League NFL History In 1902, a Pirates- backed football team, the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League, played all of its home games at the field. The Stars would go on to win the league's only championship against the Philadelphia Athletics, 11-0 at the field. The Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP) football team played their first game of the 1898 season at Recreation Park, defeating Westminster 5‚Äì0. Though WUP did play some games at Exposition Park as early as 1900, games were still hosted at Recreation Park until the University signed an exclusive contract with Exposition Park in 1904. Part of ca.1883 Barnum's newspaper advertisement =Cycling= Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss secured a lease on the park in 1901 as a preventative measure to keep the upstart American League from establishing a competing baseball franchise in Pittsburgh. Hoping also to profit from the grounds, Dreyfuss put in a modern bicycle track to be used for motor-paced races featuring the stars of the sport. Baseball umpire and boxing referee Tim Hurst was manager of the facility, which opened in May 1902 under a name variously spelled as \\"Colosseum\\" or \\"Coliseum.\\" The track, a smooth wooden oval with high bankings, encompassed a multipurpose field. Surrounding the track was newly built seating for 7,000 spectators, comprising two covered grandstands‚Äîone each on the north and south sides‚Äîand open bleachers. The venture was not long in proving a failure: Cycling did not catch on as a spectator sport, and the stadium's alternative use as a football venue was less than lucrative. No longer fearing an invasion by an opposition baseball team, (See also \\"Pittsburg Points\\" on the same page.) Dreyfuss let the lease expire in April 1904. The track was torn down and the grounds turned back over to the owners. =Other uses= Beyond simply major sporting events, the park often also doubled as a venue for circuses, carnivals, various ethnic and holiday celebrations, and track meets. Prior to the evolution of the Exposition grounds for major gatherings, Union Park was a main local gathering place, sitting immediately next to the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, that could easily and closely accommodate large crowds for exhibitors. Popular national figures such as Adam Forepaugh and P. T. Barnum would often hold their shows here, spending often up to three days located at the park before moving off to other, more typical one night shows in smaller towns. Recreation Park has a reference in the city directory as late as 1914, but the open land was soon covered over by various industrial buildings, since the early 1900s.

Batucada is characterized by its repetitive style and fast pace. Instruments The wide variety of instruments used in a batucada include: *Repinique, a high-pitched tom-tom like drum played with a single stick (or two long sticks) and the hand. Traditionally the leader of the ensemble uses the repinique (also referred to as 'repique') to direct and solo. *Surdo, a large drum with an average size of 50 cm in diameter. It provides the downbeat, the bass downbeat of the rhythm. When only one surdo is playing, it accentuates the 2nd and 4th beat of every measure. When a second surdo is playing, it is tuned slightly higher and is played accentuating the first and third beats of the measure. A third surdo de terceira or Surdo-mor syncopates in between the beats. *Tamborim, a small drum usually played with a stick or a multi-pronged plastic beater. *bells (agog√¥). *Chocalho (Ganz√°, Rocar, and shakers of various types and materials). *Caixa de guerra, a deeper snare drum w/ wires on batter head and Tarol, a thinner snare drum. *Cuica, a single headed drum with a stick mounted inside the drum body, perpendicular to the head. The instrument is played by rubbing a damp cloth along the length of this stick, while pressing the head of the drum with a finger or thumb. The harder to the stick the finger is pressed, the higher the pitch of the sound is produced. The cuica creates a unique sound, which can sometimes sound like a human voice. *timbal, a long cone-like drum that is used to produce both high & low tones in the ensemble.

The ballpark was the first home of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League during the years 1883‚Äì1886, prior to the opening of the ballpark that became known as Baker Bowl. The park was bounded by 24th Street, Ridge Avenue, 25th Street and Columbia Avenue (which in 1987 was renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue after the civil-rights leader). The park was not the only one in the area; 14 years later, Columbia Park, the first home of the Philadelphia Athletics, opened eight blocks to the west on Columbia Avenue, though this ballpark was on the opposite side of the avenue. The field was used at least as early as June 16, 1860, when Equity defeated Pennsylvania 65-52 in what author Charles Peverelly, writing about \\"the national game\\", called the \\"first baseball game played in Pennsylvania.\\" During the Civil War, a cavalry of the Union Army occupied the park. In 1866, with new houses bordering the field, a nine-foot fence was erected and the field was put back in shape for baseball. But it was poorly maintained by 1871 and used less and less. The Philadelphia Centennials of the National Association leveled and resodded the field, built a 10-foot fence, clubhouse and grandstands in 1875. They called it Centennial Park. The team folded after just 14 games and the association followed at the end of the season. With no tenant the park fell into disrepair. Alfred J. Reach bought the field in 1882, renaming it \\"Recreation Park\\". He cleared the grounds, resodded the field, built a three-section wooden grandstand, and fielded the independent team called \\"Fillies.\\" There is no historical marker or any indication that a ballpark once stood on this site. As of October 2015, a mini market stands on the corner where home plate was located, and urban housing occupies the area.

Three different types of Hemi engines have been built by Chrysler for automobiles: the first (known as the Chrysler FirePower engine) from 1951 to 1958, the second from 1964 to 1971, and the third beginning in 2003. Although Chrysler is most identified with the use of \\"Hemi\\" as a marketing term, many other auto manufacturers have incorporated similar designs. During the 1970s and 1980s, Chrysler also used the Hemi name for their Australian-made Hemi-6 Engine and applied it to the 4-cylinder Mitsubishi 2.6L engine installed in various North American market vehicles. Concept A hemispherical cylinder head (\\"hemi-head\\") gives an efficient combustion chamber with an excellent surface-to-volume ratio, with minimal heat loss to the head, and allows for two large valves. However, a hemi-head allows no more than two valves per cylinder, and these large valves are necessarily heavier than in a multi-valve engine. The intake and exhaust valves lie on opposite sides of the chamber and necessitate a \\"cross-flow\\" head design. Since the combustion chamber is a partial hemisphere, a flat- topped piston would yield too low a compression ratio unless a very long stroke is used, so to attain desired compression ratio the piston crown is domed to protrude into the head at top dead center, resulting in a combustion chamber in the shape of the thick peel of half an orange. The hemi-head design places the spark plug at or near the center of the chamber to promote a strong flame front. However, if the hemi-head hemisphere is of equal diameter to the piston, there is minimal squish for proper turbulence to mix fuel and air thoroughly. Thus, hemi-heads, because of their lack of squish, are more sensitive to fuel octane rating; a given compression ratio will require a higher octane rating to avoid pre-detonation in a hemi engine than in some conventional engine designs such as the wedge and bathtub. The hemi head always has intake and exhaust valve stems that point in different directions, requiring a large, wide cylinder head and complex rocker arm geometry in both cam-in-block and single overhead cam engines (dual overhead cam engines may not have rocker arms). This adds to the overall width of the engine, limiting the vehicles in which it can be installed. Significant challenges in the commercialization of engine designs utilizing hemispherical chambers revolved around the valve actuation, specifically how to make it effective, efficient, and reliable at an acceptable cost. This complexity was referenced early in Chrysler's development of their 1950s hemi engine: the head was referred to in company advertising as the Double Rocker Shaft head. =WWII= Chrysler developed their first experimental hemi engine for the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft. The XIV-2220 engine was an inverted V16 rated at . The P-47 was already in production with a Pratt & Whitney radial engine when the XIV-2220 flew successfully in trials in 1945 as a possible upgrade, but the war was winding down and it did not go into production. However, the exercise gave Chrysler engineers valuable research and development experience with two-valve hemi combustion chamber dynamics and parameters. In addition to the aircraft engine, Chrysler and Continental worked together to develop the air-cooled AV-1790-5B V12 Hemi engine used in the M47 Patton tank. First Generation: FirePower Chrysler applied their military experience with the hemispherical combustion chamber to their first overhead-valve V8 engine, released under the name FirePower, not \\"Hemi,\\" in 1950 for the 1951 model year. The first version of the FirePower engine had a displacement of and produced . Eventually, three of the four Chrysler divisions had its own version of the FirePower engine, with different displacements and designations, and having almost no parts in common. This lack of commonality was due in part to the three engine versions using different bore pitches (the center-to-center distance between adjacent cylinders). Chrysler and Imperial called their versions the FirePower. DeSoto called theirs the FireDome. Dodge had a smaller version, known as the Red Ram. Only Plymouth didn't have a version, instead retaining the Dodge poly-head engines: there was no Plymouth hemi engine until the 1964 426. Briggs Cunningham used the Chrysler version in some of his race cars for international motor sports. A Chrysler-powered Cunningham C-5R won its class in 1953. Cunningham switched away from these designs in 1959 when Chrysler temporarily abandoned the hemispherical concept in favor of the wedge-head B engine until 1964. Collectively, the 1951-'58 Hemi engines are now commonly referred to as first-generation Hemi engines,https://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/chrysler-hemi.html and the group can be identified by the rear-mounted distributor and the spark plugs in a row down the center of wide valve covers. 1951 Plymouth Hemi V6 There were plans in 1951 for a Plymouth Dual Overhead Cam Hemi V6 displacing 235 Cubic Inches designed by Chrysler's Powerplant Research and Engine Design division. It was meant to be a powerful, fuel efficient alternative to Ford's V8 and to replace Plymouth's venerable flathead 6. The Plans were scrapped due to build costs and because of the then unusual design.https://www.allpar.com/mopar/V6/classic-v6.html = Chrysler and Imperial = All Chrysler FirePower engines are oversquare; i.e their bore is larger than their stroke.  331  This first FirePower engine, used from 1951 to 1955, has a bore of 3.8125 in and a stroke of 3.625 in for a piston displacement of , and a deck height of 10.32\\" (\\"low deck\\"). The bore pitch, shared by all Chrysler FirePower engines, was 4.5625\\", the largest of any 1st generation hemi engines. Most used a two-barrel carburetor and produced , with the famous exception of the 1955 Chrysler C-300 equipped with dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors and rated at 300 hp.https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hrdp-1206-the-early-hemi-guide-of- death/http://www.trucktrend.com/how-to/engine/1706-history-of-the- hemi-v-8-engine/ The 331 engine was used in the following applications: * 1951‚Äì1955 Chrysler New Yorker * 1951‚Äì1954 Chrysler Imperial and 1955 Imperial * 1951 Chrysler Saratoga (optional) * 1952 Chrysler Saratoga Club Coupe (optional) * 1952 Chrysler Imperial Parade Phaeton * 1955 Chrysler C-300 * The Chrysler air raid siren. At 138 decibels, it is the loudest siren ever made.  354  The 354, released in 1956, had a bore of 3.9375 in and stroke of 3.625 in, and the same 10.32\\" low deck height. The 300B engine was rated at , while the New Yorker and Imperial 354 engine configuration produced . For the 300B an optional version was available, making it the first American V-8 to be rated at one horsepower per cubic inch. Note that was before 1972, horsepower was SAE gross. After 1972, horsepower is SAE net. The 354 was also modified. The hemi was optimized for heavy-duty truck service. These were available with one or two four-barrel carburetors, and were offered in Dodge's heaviest duty models as the 'Power Giant V-8' from 1957 through 1959; they were the largest of four hemi truck engines offered by Dodge in the 1950s. The 354 was also offered in certain models with polyspheric heads rather than hemi heads. The combustion chambers on these had similarities to both hemi and wedge heads, but were closer in weight to wedge heads. Thus, both 354 poly and 354 hemi V-8 engines were variously available in 1957. The 354 engine was used in the following applications: * 1956 Chrysler New Yorker * 1956 Chrysler 300B * 1956 Imperial Custom & Crown * 1957 Dodge D-501 * 1957‚Äì1959 Dodge C Series Pickup  392  The 392 raised-deck engine released in 1957 had a bore and stroke. The actual displacement is . The deck height, at , was taller than that of the previous blocks. Because its deck was taller, the heads were cast with wider intake ports so that earlier manifolds could be used with the new heads on the new taller block. For 1958, Chrysler offered the 392 in two configurations: with 9.25:1 compression and with 10:1 compression, both with a single four-barrel carburetor. A dual four-barrel version of the 392 available in the 1957-58 Chrysler 300C & 300D cars was rated at ; the 300D, and some marine and industrial engines, used a (now rare) adjustable rocker.Hot Rod Magazine online (retrieved 9 March 2018) An extremely rare option available on the 1958 300D was Bendix \\"Electrojector\\" fuel injection, with which the 392 was rated at . Due to reliability problems with the primitive onboard computer which controlled the injection system, however, 15 of the 16 300D cars built with the fuel injection option were recalled and retrofitted with carburetors. The 392 engine was used in the following applications: * 1957‚Äì1958 Chrysler New Yorker * 1957‚Äì1958 Imperial Custom, Crown, and LeBaron * 1957 Chrysler 300C * 1958 Chrysler 300D * 1958 Facel Vega Excellence (EX) In the late 1950s and early 1960s, drag racers found the 392 to be a formidable engine and continued to run them competitively into the 1970s. Usual color of the block was silver.Hot Rod Magazine online (retrieved 9 March 2018) = DeSoto = Automobile Show. DeSoto's Hemi engines were called Fire Dome.  276  In 1952, DeSoto introduced its version of the FirePower with a bore of and stroke of , for a displacement of . The bore pitch, shared by all DeSoto FirePower engines, was . Power output was . It was a hot seller, with 50,000 vehicles using the engine until it was replaced in 1954.  291  An increase in displacement to was made for 1955 by increasing the bore to .  330  The DeSoto engine was enlarged for 1956 to . Bore was the same as the 291 at , but stroke was increased to and a taller (raised-deck) block was used.  341  Displacement was increased again for 1956 (DeSoto Adventurer only) and 1957 (Firedome and Fireflite models) to . Bore was now with stroke remaining at . The DeSoto Adventurer produced using dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors‚Äîmore than one horsepower per cubic inch. The 1956 DeSoto Adventurer was the premiere named high-performance version‚Äîthe DeSoto equivalent of the Chrysler 300‚Äîusing dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors. The Adventurer engine for 1956 used a displacement of 341 CID (3.78\\" bore by 3.80\\" stroke) and had a compression ratio of 9.5:1, using a special hydraulic camshaft profile.  345  The largest DeSoto engine for 1957 was the DeSoto Adventurer offering with square bore and stroke dimensions of 3.80 inches. The DeSoto Adventurer used dual Carter WCFB four-barrel carburetors for a rating of , again producing one horsepower per cubic inch utilizing a similar intake manifold to the 1956 341 Adventurer and a similar camshaft. Compression ratio remained at 9.5:1. = Dodge = Dodge's Hemi was introduced in 1953 as the Red Ram. Dodge did not have a V8 engine until one was developed specifically for the line in 1953 based on the 1951 Chrysler hemi design, but downsized for these smaller cars. They have the smallest bore center distance of any hemi engine at . They do not share any major dimensions or components with the larger Chrysler and DeSoto hemi engines, or the Plymouth A engines. From 1955 to 1958 (see 1956 D500 Dodge D-500 cars and packages: early performance cars)lower performance versions of the Dodge hemi were introduced by substituting less complex poly (single rocker shaft) heads and valve train parts, including one variant only built as a poly (259\\"). These were used in low-line 1955-58 DeSotos and Dodges, and 1955-56 high-line Plymouths. Dodge Trucks marketed their version of the Hemi under the name PowerDomehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=293&v;=JZofESfdhQchttps://clickamericana.com/eras/1950s/new- prestige-styled-58-dodge-power-giants  241  Dodge introduced the engine in 1953. Bore was and stroke was . With a low compression ratio of 7.0:1 (in 1953 and for the 1954 Meadowbrook), the 241 produced . For 1954, the more senior Dodges received thanks to a higher 7.5:1 compression ratio.Lee, p. 270 This engine is not the same as the Plymouth 241, which had polyspheric, not hemi heads. The 241 only lasted two years, being replaced by the 270 for 1955.  270  The D553 1955/1956 Dodge Red Ram Hemi 270 displaced and was used in premium 1955 and 1956 Dodge vehicles. Bore was and stroke was . It was not the same as the 270 poly-head. In the Dodge Coronet, running 7.6:1 compression ratio, the 270 produced . In higher trims like the Dodge Royal, the \\"Super Red Ram\\" ran the same compression ratio but with a four-barrel carburetor produced .Lee, p. 271  315  For 1956, Dodge increased the displacement to with a longer stroke and a taller raised-deck block and now with a polyspheric heads‚Äîno longer a Hemi. But the optional high-performance D-500 version of this engine had a four-barrel carburetor and a larger valved Dodge hemispherical combustion chambered head. Also, a \\"race only\\" package called the D-500-1 or DASH 1 was available with a special aluminum dual four barrel intake that sported a pair of Carter WCFB carburetors similar to the ones on the Chrysler 300B and DeSoto Adventurer. This engine utilized the same cylinders heads as the base D-500 model. The D-501 in 57 was the Chrysler 354 engine, not a Dodge-based engine.  325  Dodge released a engine for 1957. The engine used a bore and stroke. The base engine offering was now a polyspheric chambered head referenced as 'KDS', and a higher performance 325 was offered with hemi heads as the 'KD-500'. Again there was a low volume offering of a 'KD-500-1' with dual four barrel carburetors. All engines now, however, had hydraulic camshafts even though the hemi headed offerings sported \\"dimples\\" in the valve covers for mechanical adjuster clearance. Second Generation: 426 The hemispherical head design was revived in 1964. These were the first engines officially designated Hemi, a name Chrysler had trademarked. Chrysler Hemi engines of this generation displaced . Just 11,000 Hemi engines were ultimately produced for consumer sale due to their relatively high cost and the sheer size of the engine bay required to fit it in. The 426 Hemi was nicknamed the \\"elephant engine\\" at the time, a reference to its high power, heavy weight and large physical dimensions. Its deck height and bore spacing made it the biggest engine in racing at the time. The 426 Hemi of the 1960s was an engine produced for use in NASCAR, used in a racing version of a Plymouth Belvedere in 1964. It was not initially available to the general buying public. The 426 Hemi was not allowed to compete in NASCAR's 1965 season due to its unavailability in production vehicles sold to the general public and because of complaints by Ford regarding its power. However several special production cars were produced and sold with the 426 Hemi. These were the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Fury later in 1965 included the Dodge Coronet and included aluminum fenders and bumpers for drag racing. However they were sold to the general public. Chrysler introduced the \\"Street\\" Hemi in 1966 for its intermediate range of cars and sold the required number of Hemi engines to the public to legitimize its use for NASCAR in 1966. The \\"Street Hemi\\" was the similar to the race Hemi but with an inline 2X4-bbl induction system (with automatic choke), lower compression (10.25:1 from 12.5:1) and lower-lift camshaft, with iron exhaust manifolds instead of lighter steel long tube headers. Although all manufacturers were familiar with multi-valve engines and hemispherical combustion chambers, adding more valves per cylinder, or designing the complex valvetrain needed for a hemispherical chamber were expensive ways of improving the high‚Äìrevolutions per minute (rpm) breathing of production vehicles. By canting the angle of the NASCAR-mandated two valves per cylinder, significantly larger valves could be used. The Chrysler 426 Hemi and all Chrysler RBs had oversquare bore and strokes. Specifically, the 426 Hemi and 426 Wedge had a bore x stroke of . The 426 Hemi also was used in NHRA and AHRA drag racing. Its large casting allowed the engine to be overbored and stroked to displacements unattainable in the other engines of the day. Top-fuel racing organizers limited the bore spacing of engines until very recently, when under pressure from Ford and other manufacturers, the bore spacing allowed was increased to ‚Äîthis allows other engines such as the Ford 385 series to begin to compete. The engines based on the old Chrysler design predominate Top Fuel and Funny Car classes due to plentiful parts, large amount of research and development, as well as decades of experience with the problems of the engine's design. In drag racing today, the engine bears little resemblance to any engine produced by Chrysler; it is usually equipped with a large Roots type supercharger and short individual exhaust pipes, and fueled with nitromethane. Yet, this variant is used in Top Fuel, Funny Car, and Pro Modified classes. The 426 Hemi, in \\"street Hemi\\" form, was produced for consumer automobiles from 1965 through 1971. There were many differences between the Hemi and the Wedge-head big-block, including main cross-bolted bearing caps and a different head bolt pattern. There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including but not limited to compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium oil pans in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal dry sump oil systems. Today, aftermarket blocks, heads, intakes, rods and pistons are usually made of aluminum. The street Hemi version was rated at at 5000 rpm SAE gross and at 4000 rpm of torque equipped with a pair of four-barrel Carter AFB carburetors. In actual dynamometer testing, it produced and of torque in purely stock form. Chrysler's sales literature published both the gross and net ratings for 1971. To avoid confusion with earlier (1951‚Äì58) and current Hemi engines, the 426 is sometimes called the \\"2G\\" or \\"Gen 2\\" Hemi. The street version of the 2G Hemi engine was used (optionally, in all but the last case) in the following vehicles: * 1966‚Äì1970 Dodge Coronet/Plymouth Belvedere * 1966‚Äì1971 Plymouth Satellite * 1966‚Äì1971 Dodge Charger * 1967‚Äì1971 Plymouth GTX * 1968 Dodge Dart Super Stock * 1968 Plymouth Barracuda * 1968‚Äì1971 Dodge Super Bee * 1968‚Äì1971 Plymouth Road Runner * 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona * 1970 Plymouth Superbird * 1970‚Äì1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda * 1970‚Äì1971 Dodge Challenger * 1970 Monteverdi Hai 450 = As collectibles = Hemi-powered Dodge and Plymouth cars produced in the model years of 1965 through 1971 have become collector's items. For example, a 1971 Plymouth Barracuda Convertible equipped with the 426 Hemi engine sold at auction for US$3.5 million in 2014. Third Generation: trademarked The current-production \\"HEMI\\" engine heads are flatter and more complex than the 1950s‚Äì'70s Hemi V8 chamber. The combustion chambers are no longer truly hemispherical. It uses a coil-on-plug distributorless ignition system and two spark plugs per cylinder to shorten flame travel leading to more consistent combustion and reduced emissions. Like most of Chrysler's past-model Hemi-head engines, the 5.7 version is rated at approximately one horsepower per cubic inch (the current engines are SAE net, whereas the old Hemi engines were rated SAE gross). For the 2009 model year power was increased to 357-395 horsepower (266-291 kW) and 389-410 lb¬∑ft (527-556 N¬∑m) depending on application. It also achieved 4% better fuel economy. Variable valve timing (VVT) was also introduced. A new variable displacement technology called Multi-Displacement System (MDS) is used in some versions which can shut off two cylinders on each bank under light load to improve fuel economy. = 5.7 / 345 = 5.7 Hemi engine The 5.7 L HEMI was released for model year 2003 on the Dodge Ram 1500, 2500, and 3500 pickup trucks to complement the Magnum 5.9 engine. it was the only available gasoline engine in the Ram Heavy Duty. Chrysler later made the 5.7 L Hemi available in all models of the 2004 Dodge Ram, Dodge Durango, the 2005 Chrysler 300C, Dodge Magnum R/T, Jeep Grand Cherokee, the 2006 Dodge Charger R/T, Jeep Commander, the 2007 Chrysler Aspen, and the 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T. For manual transmission applications (Challenger and 3/4- and 1-ton Ram pickups), cylinder deactivation is not included. The Hemi in the Ram delivered and , but and for the 300C and Magnum R/T, which is exactly more than the old 5.9 engine. It is a 90-degree V8, 2-valve pushrod design like the past Magnum series engines, displacing , with a bore of and a stroke of . The 5.7 L Hemi is made at Chrysler's Saltillo Engine plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico. The Hemi was on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 2003 through 2007, and again in 2009. This engine is used in the following vehicles: * 2003‚ÄìPresent Ram Pickup * 2004‚Äì2009, 2011‚ÄìPresent Dodge Durango * 2005‚Äì2008 Dodge Magnum R/T * 2005‚ÄìPresent Chrysler 300C, 300S V8 (2010, 2012-Present) * 2005‚ÄìPresent Jeep Grand Cherokee * 2006‚ÄìPresent Dodge Charger R/T * 2006‚Äì2010 Jeep Commander * 2007‚Äì2009 Chrysler Aspen * 2009‚ÄìPresent Dodge Challenger R/T =2009 Revisions, 5.7 Eagle= Chrysler has made various revisions to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable Camshaft Timing or VCT. VCT (which is essentially variable valve timing) uses an oil control valve which controls oil flow to a unique camshaft sprocket which contains a phasing device, which depending on the operation of the oil control valve either advances or retards camshaft timing. Cylinder heads have been revised to increase flow. Though the intake manifold has also been changed on all applications, it is however model specific. Dodge Ram, non-Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Chrysler Aspens, and non-HEV Dodge Durango utilize an active intake manifold with a short runner valve to optimize torque and horsepower. At lower engine rpm the valve is closed, resulting in improved low-end torque from the longer runners. At higher engine rpm the valve is opened, diverting the incoming air into the center of the manifold. The shorter runners results in improved horsepower. Passenger cars, Jeep vehicles, as well as HEV Chrysler Aspen and HEV Dodge Durango do not use this manifold; instead, these vehicles utilize a passive intake manifold, which does not have a short runner valve. Six-speed manual transmission and all Heavy Duty truck applications will differ by not having the Multi-Displacement System (MDS). The new version of the 5.7L has five different camshaft profiles. All will have VCT. * Active intake with MDS * Active intake without MDS * Passive intake with MDS * Passive intake without MDS * HEV Application (modified version of passive intake with MDS) Power Numbers * 300C: , * Charger R/T: , * Challenger R/T Automatic: , * Challenger R/T 6 Speed Manual: , * 2009-2012 Ram 1500 Truck: , * 2013+ Ram 1500 Truck: , * Ram 2500/3500 Truck: , * Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Commander: , * 2011+ Dodge Durango: , * 2009 Chrysler Aspen and Dodge Durango non-HEV: , * 2009 Chrylser Aspen and Dodge Durango HEV: , =6.1= 6.1 Hemi engine The Hemi is also available in a version.

It features the same bore as the 6.4 L Hemi and the same stroke as the 5.7 L, giving it a total displacement of . The supercharger is a twin-screw IHI unit with integrated charge coolers, capable of producing of boost. This engine is rated at at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm of torque and has a compression ratio of 9.5:1. This engine was the most powerful engine produced by Chrysler as well as the most powerful production engine ever in a muscle car until the Dodge Demon was introduced. This engine is not equipped with Chrysler's Multi- Displacement System. In 2017, Mopar announced that it would sell it as a crate engine under the name Hellcrate.You Can Buy a 707-HP Hellcat Crate Engine Directly From Mopar - Brian Silvestro, Road and Track, 30 October 2017 A Redeye version with 797hp debuted in the Dodge Challenger in 2019, followed by the Dodge Charger in 2021.

It is fitted with a larger, 2.7 litre twin-screw supercharger, as well as reinforced reciprocating components, a new camshaft, and several other valvetrain upgrades. With these improvements, the Challenger SRT Demon is rated at 808 horsepower on 91-octane pump gasoline, and 840 horsepower when running on 100-octane unleaded racing gasoline. Cooling is aided by a functional Air- Grabber hood scoop, as well as a unique charge cooling system which makes use of the air-conditioning coolant to lower the intake charge air temperature. High-speed launches are assisted by a factory line-lock system, which allows the car to perform a burnout to warm the rear tires, the first transmission brake to be installed in a production car, and the Torque Reserve Launch System.

It is equipped with high-strength forged aluminium alloy pistons. This engine has been available since 2007, as a crate engine under the name 392 HEMI. The production version of the 392 HEMI was launched in the 2011 Dodge Challenger SRT8 with variable camshaft timing as well as MDS in cars with automatic transmissions. The new 392 HEMI, codenamed \\"Apache,\\" is based on the third-generation 5.7L HEMI, codenamed \\"Eagle,\\" and shares few parts with the 392 crate engine. In late 2009 Chrysler has said the new engine will be available in the next generation SRT8 Dodge Charger, Chrysler 300, and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Special-Edition Chargers and Challengers equipped with this engine, and the engines themselves, will bear \\"392 HEMI\\" badging in commemorative reference to the First-Generation HEMI Engine of the same piston displacement.

The Chrysler 300 SRT (Overseas) still remained the same Horsepower and Torque as the 2012-2014 Model Years. This engine is available in both the Dodge Charger and Challenger SRT 392 (2015-2018), including R/T Scat Pack Models (Chrysler's Main Affiliated Trim Models not related to the SRT Division) The Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, The Dodge Durango SRT (2018-Present), and the Chrysler 300 SRT (Available in Overseas Markets from 2015-Present). In 2014, Chrysler chose to change the SRT8 moniker to SRT, removing the 8 which was a cylinder quantity nomenclature. From thereon, this was put into effect for all SRT models from all of Chrysler's divisions. =HD Truck and Cab Chassis Version= Starting in model year 2014, the Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks, and Ram 3500, 4500, and 5500 Cab Chassis offered a revised version of the 6.4L, being re-tuned for better fuel economy and a power band more suitable for hauling and towing than the all-out power of the SRT Version.

The winner was the HEMI Big Wheel, which had a 5.7 L HEMI in the back that was installed backwards, thus reverse became the only forward gear. Plate steel was the predominant material, while a rolled tube of steel had to be utilized for the front tire as there were no such tires in diameter that were as narrow as needed for this project.

Origin  The origin of the term \\"fall guy\\" is unknown and contentious. Many sources place its origin in the early 20th century, while some claim an earlier origin. In April 2007, William Safire promoted a search to unearth its origins.William Safire, \\"Sweet Spot\\", New York Times Magazine, 1 Apr 2007William Safire, \\"Fall Guy\\", The New York Times Magazine, 29 Apr 2007 Four slightly different usages for \\"fall guy\\" survive and their origins are probably different. These usages are: # An innocent scapegoat is unjustly punished for another's action. # A scapegoat takes the blame for the actions of a group. # A dupe takes the butt of jokes. # A worker takes on the responsibilities of others. The phrase may have multiple, separate origins. Criminal usage goes back to the original sense of \\"felon\\" (derived from fallen, morally). = Other alternatives and citations = * The term \\"fall guy\\" appears in an April 26, 1903, Chicago Tribune article \\"Plot to Defeat Mueller Bill\\"PLOT TO DEFEAT MUELLER BILL April 26, 1903 Chicago Tribune * Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang (HDAS) places the origin in 1904 (although it is apparently missing citations for 1906). The usage here may have a flavor relating more to the innocent rather than the guilty scapegoat. * The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) places the origin in 1906 (Green At Actors' Boarding House 226). The usage here conforms to that of the guilty scapegoat. * In The New York Times: This article is concurrent with the OED citation (no within year dates for OED citation yet found). * The Online Etymological Dictionary places the origin at 1906. The actual passage they cite is unstated, although probably citing the OED. * Gary Martin dates the origin to at least 1904 (Oakland Tribune, December 1904) although possibly earlier. Although the citation Martin provides shades meaning more closely to \\"one who takes on the responsibilities or workload of others\\" (this sense seems analogous to the modern phrase \\"delegate down\\") than to the more criminal connotation. He also makes a connection to the phrase \\"fall money\\" that existed in late 19th-century American idiom. If fall guy derives from \\"fall money\\", then this may be the earliest possibility. * \\"POOLROOM SHARPS SWOOP ON BASEBALL; Crippled Badly by Race Track Legislation, Gamblers Turn to National Game.\\"The New York Times, February 28, 1911, Tuesday The phrase \\"fall guy\\" here refers, apparently, to a sucker who makes bets at bad odds. There is a reference to being unable (or finding it difficult) to hedge bets against a \\"'Dutch book ‚Äì with reverse English.\\" No guilt is associated with the fall guy, only gullibility. * The phrase was in prominent usage by at least 1930, when Hammett published The Maltese Falcon. Hammett adopts the guilty scapegoat interpretation. * Various compiled glossaries:  The New York Times: An article about John Wilstach included a jargon dictionary has both 'fall guy' and 'fall money', implying that phrases were well known by then.  Possibly arose from hobo lingo predating the 20th century. Alternatively, they may have picked it up from the criminal classes.  Criminal lingo (undated). * to fall, n. to get in trouble with the law * Definition from American Underworld Dictionary gives slightly different meanings: 1. Any person, guilty or innocent (emphasis added), who takes full blame to shield others. 2. A fool; a bungling criminal; a stupid tool of crafty criminals. \\"These stirs (prisons) are full of fall guys and squares (accidental criminals). All the hip (smart) ghees (fellows) hit the counties (country jails) or the street (win acquittals or bribe their way out)\\". (See also their usage of 'fall dough') * The New York Times also referred to the \\"butt of jokes\\" with no criminal connotation. * In 19th century professional wrestling, claims significantly predates other origins, so claims must be met with scrutiny and skepticism, demanding a citation.  A Voice of America radio broadcast transcript supports this position, but proper supporting citations are not yet found.http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/2007-03-19-voa2.cfm * Another hypothesis puts its origins with the rising film industry; thus, the \\"fall guy\\" was a stock character. = Discredited origins =  Guy Fawkes  Various sources attribute the origin of fall guy to Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot. This has been largely discredited.  Teapot connection  One popular myth is that the word's origin dates to the 1920s, during the administration of U.S. President Warren G. Harding (1921‚Äì1923), when Albert B. Fall, a U.S. Senator from New Mexico who served as Secretary of the Interior during Harding's years in office, became notorious for his involvement in the infamous Teapot Dome Scandal. Though this is a popular story, references to 'fall guy' and Albert Fall have not been found. The book The Tempest Over Teapot Dome contains no references to \\"fall guy\\". A Time article from the period makes no reference to \\"fall guys\\", although the scandal may have had yet to fully play out. However, this event may have popularized the phrase (via post-hoc eponymy). = Political crossover = Legitimization occurred in the 1940s, primarily with the meaning of \\"take on work/responsibility\\". A paper on \\"Isolationism is not dead\\" quotes an anonymous editorial from a paper in the Pacific Northwest on the topic of the Bretton Woods and the Food Conferences upon which the US became the \\"fall guy, the one to carry the load\\". By 1950 in the context of unions and industrial society, the term referred to the low man on the totem pole, to whom the unpleasant tasks would be assigned, specifically that of filling out questionnaires. By the 1950s and 1960s, \\"fall guy\\" came to mean public \\"whipping boy\\" in the abstract, metaphorical sense. In a 1960 paper called the \\"Politics of Pollution\\", Robert Bulard writes public officials, to deflect criticism over landfills, found a \\"fall guy\\", but they blamed abstract, faceless bodies: \\"the federal government, state governments and private disposal companies\\" rather than an individual. Other abstract 'fall guys' included the railroad and bank capital. Use of the political \\"fall guy\\" is exemplified in the following three events: # The Assassination of John F. Kennedy: Oswald was not commonly referred to as a \\"fall guy\\" until 1964 when Joachim Joesten used the term in his book title Oswald, Assassin or Fall Guy?. Oswald \\"was ‚Äòa fall guy‚Äô\\" to use the parlance of the kind of men who must have planned the details of the assassination\\". # The Watergate Scandal: Former Attorney General John Mitchell claimed he was being set up as a \\"fall guy\\". In Public Doublespeak: On Mistakes and Misjudgments Terence Moran uses the term in reference to a transcript of both Richard Nixon and Dean. He also cites a scene from The Maltese Falcon, in which Wilmer, the gunman is sold out. # Iran Contra Scandal: The term entered into public consciousness, if not quite into everyday parlance. Before this scandal Richard Safire seems to have kept the phrase alive. The phrase's use increased after Iran-Contra in 1987; Representative Louis Stokes' used the phrase during a session of Congress in regard to Oliver North's steadfastness and loyalty during the hearings.See official transcript, but also \\"The discourse of American civil society: A new proposal for cultural studies\\". Jeffrey C. Alexander and Philip Smith. Theory & Society: Vol 22, No 2, p 189. = Other uses = In corporate managerial classes, by 1988 the \\"fall guy\\" was institutionalized as a principle, a component of what every good manager needed. A few examples of fall guys: * George Tenet: pre-Iraq war intelligence * Scooter Libby: Valerie Plame affair * Michael D. Brown: federal response to Hurricane Katrina * Col. Janis Karpinski: mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison * Maj. Gen. George W.

The site is considered among the most imposing relics of Buddhism in all of Gandhara, and has been \\"exceptionally well-preserved.\\" The Buddhist monastery was founded in the 1st century CE,Takht-i-Bahi, UNESCO Office, Islamabad, Pakistan, 2002 and was in use until the 7th century. The complex is regarded by archaeologists as being particularly representative of the architecture of Buddhist monastic centers from its era.UNESCO Advisory Body Evaluation of Takht Bhai Takht-i-Bahi was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. Etymology The word Takht-i-Bahi may have different explanations. Local believes that site got its name from two wells on the hill or the springs nearby. In Persian, Takht means \\"top\\" or \\"throne\\" while bahi means \\"spring\\" or \\"water\\". When combined together its meaning is Spring from the Top or High Spring, and there were two springs on the top of mountains. Another meaning suggested is Throne of Origin. Location Location of Takht-i-Bahi, at the center of the Gandhara area. The ruins are located about 15 kilometers from Mardan in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. A small fortified city, dating from the same era, sits nearby. The ruins also sit near a modern village known by the same name.UNESCO Periodic Report It is located around 500 feet atop the small hill and around 2 km from village bazar. The surrounding area is famous for sugar cane, wheat, maize, vegetable, and orchard cultivation. Once remote and little visited, the site now has a road and car park, set some way below the ruins, and has become popular with visitors.  Structure  There are four main areas of the Takht Bahi complex: * The Stupa Court, a cluster of stupas located in a central courtyard. * The monastic chambers, consisting of individual cells arranged around a courtyard, assembly halls, and a dining area. * A temple complex, consisting of stupas and similar to the Stupa Court, but of later construction. * The Tantric monastic complex, which consists of small, dark cells with low openings, which may have been used for certain forms of Tantric meditation. Additional structures on the site may have served as residences or meeting halls, or for secular purposes. All of the buildings on the site are constructed from local stone, and are mortared with lime and mud. History Archaeologists have divided the history of the complex into four periods, beginning in the 1st century BCE. The monastic complex was likely founded in the early 1st century CE.UNESCO Descrtiption It is proven by an inscriptions found bearing the name of Gondophares (20-46 CE). After Gondophares, the place fell under control of Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan king. This first era continued until the 2nd century CE, and is associated with another Kushan king Kanishka, as well as early Parthian and later Kushan kings. The second construction period, which included the creation of the Stupa Court and assembly hall, took place during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. A third construction period, associated with the later Kushan dynasty and the Kidara Kushana rulers, occurred during the 4th and 5th centuries. The region was runover by Huns in middle of fifth century C.E. which ended the Kushan rule there. The Hun Toramana and then his son Mihirakula unleashed genocide of the populace of Gandhara and a wholesale destruction of Buddhist monastries. The Buddhist monastery of Takht-i-Bahi seems to have been destroyed in the same period of carnage by Huns. Short Guide To Takht-i-bahi by Shakur, M.a. The complex nonetheless was in use until 7th century CE. The first modern historical reference to these ruins was made in 1836 by the French Officer, the Buddhist remains are in a village named Mazdoorabad. Explorations and excavations on this site began in 1864. A significant number of objects from the site can be found in the British Museum.British Museum Collection The site underwent a major restoration in the 1920s.

Meager economic conditions, poor educational facilities, and the nefarious effect of dealers of antiquities often result in severe hazard for the proper preservation of archaeological heritage in minor, less controlled sites.

History The band's origins started with the disintegration of the Time in 1984. Lead singer Morris Day had left the band to pursue a solo career and guitarist Jesse Johnson became the de facto band leader. Prince suggested restructuring the band with new member Paul Peterson to head the group, but Johnson opposed. A few of the Time's newer members followed Johnson to join his backing band (called Jesse Johnson's Revue). As the band had served as an outlet for Prince to release more music, he wanted to continue this avenue, inviting the remaining members of the Time, Jellybean Johnson, Jerome Benton, and Paul Peterson, to his home and presented them with his new project. They agreed to become a new band called the Family, with Peterson renamed \\"St. Paul\\" as the new frontman and bassist. Johnson and Benton reprised their familiar roles from the Time. To the mix, Prince added Susannah Melvoin, the twin sister of Revolution guitarist Wendy Melvoin, as a backing singer and keyboardist. The fifth member was Eric Leeds, the brother of Prince's tour manager Alan Leeds, who provided saxophone and flute. Bassist Allen Flowers joined the band. Guitarist Miko Weaver is credited in the album's booklet because he was to be a session player and tour musician band supporter, but was never officially part of the band. Much like the Time, the band's material was composed nearly entirely by Prince, with the exception of \\"River Run Dry\\", which was written by Revolution drummer Bobby Z. Prince wrote and performed all the other tracks and simply overdubbed Peterson's and Melvoin's vocals and added saxophone and flute by Leeds. On several tracks Prince's vocals can be clearly heard. Some of the original demos have surfaced as bootlegs and circulate among fans with Prince's original lead vocals, as well as two outtakes: the instrumental \\"Feline\\" and the pop song \\"Miss Understood\\". As on other associates' albums, Prince falsely gave credit to the various band members for writing credits, though he kept his name on \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\". The tracks were all recorded in a few weeks' span at the end of the year 1984 after Prince had finished sessions for Around the World in a Day, and just before he started to record music for Sheila E.'s album Romance 1600 and his own album Parade. The album The album itself is a mix of uptempo funk songs (\\"High Fashion\\", \\"Mutiny\\"), unconventional soul ballads (\\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\", \\"Desire\\"), jazz-funk instrumental tracks (\\"Yes\\", \\"Susannah's Pajamas\\") and New Wave songs (\\"The Screams of Passion\\", \\"River Run Dry\\"). \\"The Screams of Passion\\" was released as the first single from the album. MTV placed the video for the song in light rotation. \\"High Fashion\\" was the second single, but no video was made. The album sold poorly upon its release and has been out of print in any form since the late 1980s in the United States. A compact disc version was printed in Germany in the early 1990s following the success of Sinead O'Connor's cover version of Nothing Compares 2 U which was released that same year and is highly valued among Prince fans and collectors. The album is now available on iTunes. Prince often incorporated the track \\"Mutiny\\" into the setlist of his Parade Tour in 1986, which occasionally was extended to contain the chorus of \\"Dream Factory\\" and the chant \\"St. Paul ‚Äì punk of the month!\\" as well as in later tours. From 1990 onwards Prince occasionally added \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" to the setlist of several tours. The breakup After the band performed a single concert, released their self-titled album and only two singles, Peterson felt constricted by Prince's control and opted to pursue his own career. Without a lead singer, Prince lost interest and absorbed most of the remaining members into the expanded Revolution with the exception of Johnson, who went on to join the Flyte Tyme music production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Reformation and fDeluxe According to St. Paul's website, he fondly remembers his time with the Family and often plays songs from the album in concert. The Family reunited on December 13, 2003, for a single performance for charity along with other acts formerly associated with Prince. On January 26, 2007, the Family announced that they are returning to the music scene, with a tour and a recording of new music. Now called fDeluxe, they finally reformed in June 2011 and released a new record called Gaslight with four of the five original members performing.

At different times, he has managed artists as diverse as the Yardbirds, John's Children, Marc Bolan, Japan, London, Ultravox, Boney M, Sinitta, Wham!, Blue Mercedes, Alsou and Candi Staton, among others. Early years Napier-Bell attended Durston House in Ealing and then later a primary school at Perivale. He then attended Harrow County School for Boys and Bryanston School in Dorset. Whilst at Bryanston he formed the school's first jazz band. When he left school at age 17, it was with the idea of becoming a professional musician, preferably in America. A year later, unable to get a visa to the United States, he emigrated to Canada. Napier-Bell is an atheist.\\"Bob was arguing the point but Dick was having none of it. 'Look, I'm telling you. There'll be no fucking religion ‚Äì not Christian, not Jewish, not Muslim. Nothing. For God's sake, man ‚Äì you were born Jewish, which makes your religion money, doesn't it? So stick with it, for Christ's sake. I'm giving you 20 million bucks ‚Äì it's like baptising you, like sending you to heaven. So what are you fucking moaning about? You want 20 million bucks from us? Well, you gotta do what we tell you. And what we're telling you is... No Torah! No Bible! No Koran! No Jesus! No God! No Allah! No fucking religion. It's going in the contract.' As a devout atheist, I could hardly object, though it seemed tough that a contract should include such specific restrictions.\\" Simon Napier-Bell, 'The life and crimes of the music biz', The Observer (England), January 20, 2008, Observer Music Magazine, p. 41. Music business =Songwriter= When he returned to England he worked as an assistant film editor. With a thorough knowledge of music, he soon progressed to being a music editor and landed the job of working with Burt Bacharach on What's New Pussycat, re-editing the score Bacharach had written for it. Later, he also scored, wrote and edited music for Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush (1967), a film directed by Clive Donner. In 1966, Dusty Springfield approached Napier-Bell and Vicki Wickham to write an English lyric to an Italian song she had heard at the Sanremo Festival, composed by Pino Donaggio. The result was \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\", which became Springfield's only number one hit in the UK Singles Chart.For his account, see Simon Napier-Bell, You Don't Have to Say You Love Me (Ebury Press, 2005), pp. 4-5 =Manager= A friend, Vicki Wickham, who booked all the acts for the TV show Ready Steady Go!, persuaded him to move into music management. He began by putting together an act himself; Nicky Scott & Diane Ferraz; a boy from London and a girl from the West Indies. The inter-racial mix was a first for the British music business. The Yardbirds asked him if he would manage them. They were looking for a replacement for their original manager, Giorgio Gomelsky. With the group's bassist, Paul Samwell-Smith, Napier-Bell then co- produced the Yardbirds‚Äô first studio album‚ÄîRoger the Engineer. He oversaw the entry of Jimmy Page into the group and produced the group's next single, \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\", considered one of the most avant garde rock records of the time. Napier-Bell managed John's Children, who were better known for their ability to shock rather than for their music and who were thrown off a major tour of Germany for upstaging The Who with an act that included running round the audience throwing feathers in the air and whipping each other with chains. Napier-Bell teamed up with Ray Singer to produce records for various artists including the Scaffold (a group which included Paul McCartney's brother, Mike McGear), Peter Sarstedt, Forever More (which went on to change itself into The Average White Band) and lesser known acts, Plus and Brut. He also spent a year in Australia where he worked for Albert Productions and produced acts such as Alison McCallum, Bobbi Marchini and John Paul Young (who later credited Napier-Bell with having discovered him). Following this, he worked in Spain and South America for two years, managing one of Spain's biggest stars, J√∫nior, with whom he co-wrote several Spanish hits, in particular the biggest selling Spanish language single of the 1970s, \\"Perd√≥name\\". In 1976, he came back to London and returned to management with two new groups, London, a group in the then current punk vein, and Japan, an art-rock group. London was a short-lived project (two national tours, two singles, a 4-track EP and an album for MCA Records) but Japan involved him for the next seven years. Napier-Bell persevered with them through five lean years to eventually help make them one of the most influential groups of the early 1980s. Napier-Bell then established an association with manager Jazz Summers and together they took on the management of Wham!. The group had previously had three hit singles in the UK but wanted to terminate their contract with the record company, Innervision. Napier-Bell and Summers led them through four months of legal complications (during which they were unable to record), and finally settled the case by signing a new contract with CBS. Napier-Bell spent eighteen months travelling backwards and forwards to China negotiating for Wham! to become the first ever Western pop artist to play in communist China. They eventually played a concert there in April 1985 at the Worker's Stadium in Beijing. At the end of 1985, Wham! ended its relationship with Napier-Bell and Summers when George Michael left Wham! for a solo career. Napier-Bell went on to manage the duo Blue Mercedes, who had one worldwide hit, \\"I Want To Be Your Property\\" (1987), which stayed at No. 1 in the US dance charts for 14 weeks. He arranged for the defunct pop group Boney M. to reform and had all their old tracks remixed by Stock Aitken Waterman. The result was an album that stayed at number one in the French charts for four months but sold little elsewhere. Following this, Napier-Bell collaborated with another manager, Harry Cowell, and they took on the management of two once major groups looking to revive their careers - Asia and Ultravox. Asia fared better than Ultravox, but eventually Napier-Bell gave up on both of them and spent three years writing a book, Black Vinyl White Powder. He returned to artist management, this time working in Russia, first managing Alsou, a girl singer, then Smash!!, a boy duo with Wham! similarities In 2013, he joined forces with Dutch entrepreneur Bj√∂rn de Water by setting up Snap-B Music Ltd, a music consultancy company offering advice to artist managers. Napier-Bell terminated his directorship of the company in 2016 but remains a consultant. =Author= When Japan broke up, Napier-Bell wrote his first book, You Don't Have To Say You Love Me, about his experiences in the music business in the 1960s. When he ceased managing Asia and Ultravox he wrote another book, Black Vinyl White Powder, about the British music business which was received with favourable reviews. In March 2005, he published another book, I'm Coming To Take You To Lunch, the story of how he took Wham! to China. In 2015, Unbound Books published his fourth book, Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay, which is a complete history of the music industry since the early 18th Century until today. All four books have received multiple reviews. =Documentaries= In recent years he has turned to film-making and directed three full-length documentary films: To Be Frank , about Frank Sinatra, and 27: Gone Too Soon , about the 27 Club, both for Netflix; 50 Years Legal, marking 50 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK, for Sky Arts. Napier-Bell is CEO of the Pierbel Group , which offers music management and consultancy, and is originating producer of Raiding the Rock Vault , the No 1 rated music show in Las Vegas , and Raiding the Country Vault, in Branson, Missouri.

It is northwest of Eastbourne and south of Wilmington. Locally, the figure was once often called the \\"Green Man\\". The Long Man is tall, holds two \\"staves\\", and is designed to look in proportion when viewed from below. Formerly thought to originate in the Iron Age or even the neolithic period, a 2003 archaeological investigation has shown that the figure may have been cut in the Early Modern era ‚Äì the 16th or 17th century AD. From afar the figure appears to have been carved from the underlying chalk; but the modern figure is formed from white-painted breeze blocks and lime mortar. The Long Man is one of two major extant human hill figures in England; the other is the Cerne Abbas Giant, north of Dorchester. Both are Scheduled Ancient Monuments. Two other hill figures that include humans are the Osmington White Horse and the Fovant regimental badges. The Long Man is one of two hill figures in East Sussex; the other is the Litlington White Horse. Origins Artist's impression The origin of the Long Man remains unclear. For many years the earliest known record was a drawing made by William Burrell when he visited Wilmington Priory, near Windover (or Wind-door) Hill, in 1766. Burrell's drawing shows a figure holding a rake and a scythe, both shorter than the present staves. In 1993, another drawing was discovered in the Devonshire Collections at Chatsworth House which had been made by the surveyor John Rowley in 1710, now the first definite date on which the figure is known to have existed. An early suggestion, sometimes stated to be a local tradition, was that the Long Man had been cut by monks from nearby Wilmington Priory, and represented a pilgrim, but this was not widely believed by antiquarians, who felt that monks were unlikely to have created an unclothed figure.St Croix, Rev. W. \\"The Wilmington Giant\\" in Sussex archaeological collections relating to the history and antiquities of the county, Volume 26, 88 Until fairly recently the Long Man was most commonly asserted to have been cut in the neolithic period, primarily due to the presence of a long barrow nearby, or given an Iron Age attribution based on a perceived similarity to other hill figures. Professor John North wrote that during the centuries around 3480 BC the figure would have been positioned to mark the constellation Orion's movement across the ridge above it. The figure, according to this interpretation, may have been a manifestation of a Neolithic astral religion. Another suggestion was that the figure had a Romano-British provenance, while an origin in the time of Anglo-Saxon England gained credence after the 1965 discovery at Finglesham in Kent of an Anglo-Saxon brooch depicting a figure, (possibly Odin), holding two spears in a similar fashion to the Long Man. Archaeological work performed in 2003 by Professor Martin Bell of the University of Reading, in association with Aubrey Manning's Open University programme Landscape Mysteries, strongly suggested that the figure dates from the Early Modern period ‚Äì the 16th or 17th century AD. Bell found that the slope on which the Long Man was cut had gone through a period of instability in this time, after a very long prior period of stability, suggesting that the figure was first cut then. This has opened up the possibility that the Long Man could be a Tudor or Stuart-era political satire in the manner recently posited for the Cerne Abbas giant, or possibly a religious image associated with the Reformation: Professor Ronald Hutton noted that \\"we can at least celebrate the fact that we have our first, apparently unequivocally, Early Modern hill figure, and historians now have to reckon with it.\\" Pre-20th century history Whatever the figure's origin, for much of its history it seems to have existed only as a shadow or indentation in the grass, visible after a light fall of snow or as a different shade of green in summer: it is described or illustrated as such in 1710, 1781, 1800, 1835 and 1851. Indeed, the figure was once known locally as the \\"Green Man\\". Earlier depictions, such as those of Rowley and Burrell, show other details such as a possible scythe blade on the right-hand staff and the suggestion of a helmet or hat on the figure's head: they also indicate a different, albeit indistinct, position for the feet. The current outline of the Long Man is largely the result of a 'restoration' of 1873-4, when a group led by the vicar of Glynde, Reverend William de St Croix, marked out the outline with yellow bricks whitewashed and cemented together, though it has been claimed that the restoration process distorted the position of the feet. The archaeologist John S. Phen√©, who was co-opted into the project and whose 1873 talk to the Royal Institute of British Architects had originally inspired it, initially expressed his reservations with both the bricking and the design used. The original intention of the 'restoration' had been to cut the figure down to the chalk bedrock, but had been abandoned after trials showed that the soil depth made this too difficult. In the years after the 'restoration' several people familiar with the figure commented that the feet were altered, having originally both pointed outwards and downwards so that \\"the Giant appeared to be coming down the hill\\", in the words of Ann Downs, who had grown up at Wilmington Priory in the 1840s. Resistivity surveys conducted in the 1990s by R. Castleden, combined with examination of apparent shadow marks shown in early photographs, have provided strong evidence that the feet had in fact pointed outwards as described by 19th century observers and had been slightly lower than in the current outline. The surveys showed that the figure had likely been originally cut by trenching, in the same manner as other chalk hill figures, but had been abandoned after only a few scourings. There was also some evidence to suggest that the feature on one staff similar to a scythe blade, flail or shepherd's crook was genuine, along with a suggestion of a \\"helmet\\" or hat. It seems likely that the proportions of the figure have been distorted slightly by the 1873 bricking and the 1969 replacement of the bricks with breeze blocks, with the Long Man having been up to tall prior to 1873. 20th and 21st centuries Annual pagan Long Man celebrations (with effigy) In 1925, the site of the Long Man was given to the Sussex Archaeological Trust (now the Sussex Archaeological Society) by the Duke of Devonshire. During the Second World War it was painted green to avoid it being used as a landmark by German aircraft. The 1993 book, The Druid Way by Sussex author Philip Carr-Gomm, drew attention to the supposed significance of the Long Man as a sacred site for the modern world. At dawn on May Day, the Long Man Morris Men dance at the foot of the Long Man. The Long Man plays host to neo-pagan rituals on Sundays closest to the eight Pagan Festivals through the year. The vandalised Long Man during summer solstice 2010 In 2007, the Long Man of Wilmington was used in Trinny Woodall's and Susannah Constantine's television fashion show Undress the Nation. Trinny, Susannah and 100 women gave the Long Man a temporary female form by using their bodies to add pigtails, breasts and hips. ITV stated that they were given permission for the event by Sussex Archaeological Society and that they took \\"the utmost care... to protect this historical site\\". The Long Man was not permanently changed or affected, according to the owners, the Sussex Archaeological Society. The stunt prompted local Druid Greg Draven to form a protest during filming. Sussex Archaeological Society later apologised for any offence caused to any \\"individuals or groups\\" by the filming. The Council of British Druid Orders claimed the stunt would \\"dishonour an ancient Pagan site of worship\\". Overnight, between 17 June and 18 June 2010 a giant phallus was painted on the Long Man rivalling that of the Cerne Abbas Giant. Observed by locals it appeared that a football pitch marker or similar object was used to paint the phallus onto the Long Man. Literary inclusions In Arthur Beckett's 1909 Spirit of the Downs, a chapter is dedicated to the Long Man of Wilmington, in \\"The Hero on the Hill\\", and gives a fictional account of the invading Saxon's victory over the Britons, who celebrate by drawing an enormous figure on the Downs. Eleanor Farjeon, in her book Martin Pippin in the Daisy Field (1937), gives a fancy origin of the giant in a form of a folktale told by Martin Pippin the bard to six young girls in the daisy field. In his comic The Sandman #19 (1990), Neil Gaiman interprets the figure as the guardian of a gateway into Faerie. The Long Man plays a prominent role in the Spike and Suzy comic book The Circle of Power (1998). The figure also features in The Old Weird Albion by Justin Hopper and The Light Keeper by Cole Moreton. The Long Man is frequently referenced in the works of English SF/Fantasy author John Whitbourn.  Musical interpretations  The Long Man has long been an influence on artists, musicians, and authors. The composers Benjamin Britten and Frank Bridge would often picnic at the foot of the figure.

The basilica is known for enshrining the house in which the Blessed Virgin Mary is believed by some Catholics to have lived. Pious legends claim the same house was flown over by angelic beings from Nazareth to Tersatto (Trsat in Croatia), then to Recanati, before arriving at the current site.Donald Posner - Annibale Carracci, A study in the reform of Italian painting, 1971.

Pope Benedict XV designated the religious image as patroness of air passengers and auspicious travel on 24 March 1920. Pope Pius XI granted a Canonical Coronation to the venerated image of made of Cedar of Lebanon on 5 September 1922, replacing the original Marian image consumed in fire on 23 February 1921. The church building The basilica is a Late Gothic structure continued by Giuliano da Maiano (1432‚Äì1490), Giuliano da Sangallo (1445‚Äì1516) and Donato Bramante (1444‚Äì1514).\\"Basilica della Santa Casa\\", Fodor's It is 93 meters long, 60 meters wide, and its campanile is 75.6 meters high. The fa√ßade of the church was erected under Sixtus V, who in 1586 fortified Loreto and gave it the privileges of a town; his colossal statue stands on the parvis, above the front steps, a third of the way to the left as one enters. Over the principal doorway there is a lifesize bronze statue of the Virgin and Child by Girolamo Lombardo; the three superb bronze doors executed at the latter end of the 16th century under the reign of Paul V (1605‚Äì1621) are also by Lombardo (1506-1590), his sons and his pupils, among them Tiburzio Vergelli (1551-1609), who also made the fine bronze font in the interior. The doors and hanging lamps are by the same artists. The richly decorated campanile (1750 to 1754), by Luigi Vanvitelli, is of great height; the principal bell, presented by Leo X in 1516, weighs 11 tons. The interior of the church has mosaics by Domenichino and Guido Reni and other works of art, including statues by Raffaello da Montelupo. In the sacristies on each side of the right transept are frescoes, on the right by Melozzo da Forl√¨, on the left by Luca Signorelli and in both there are some fine intarsias; the basilica as a whole is thus a collaborative work by generations of architects and artists. The Santa Casa Marble screen around the Holy House The main attraction of Loreto is the Holy House itself (in Italian, the Santa Casa di Loreto). It has been a Catholic pilgrimage destination since at least the 14th century and a popular tourist destination for non-Catholics as well. =The \\"house\\"= The \\"house\\" itself consists of three stone walls. It is a plain stone structure, with a door on the north side and a window on the west. The size is 31 13 feet, i.e. 9 x 4 m (or 8.5 m by 3.8 m and 4.1 m high). The \\"house\\" contains the \\"Altar of the Apostles\\", venerated as the authentic one built by St Peter and the Apostles. A niche contains a 33 inches highCathedral of Loreto, at Roman-Catholic-Saints.com, retrieved 10 April 2020 black image of the Virgin and Child, a statue made of Lebanon cedar, richly adorned with jewels, placed above the altar. A legend attributes the statue to Saint Luke, described in the Bible a physician, with a later tradition adding painting to his skills, and here given also the attribute of a sculptor; but its style suggests it was created in the 15th century. The \\"Black Madonna\\", known as Our Lady of Loreto, owes its dark colour to centuries of lamp smoke and is carved from Cedar of Lebanon. Much like the Holy House, it is associated with miracles. The statue was commissioned after a fire in the Santa Casa in 1921 destroyed the original madonna, and it was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar. =The sculpted marble screen= Around the house is a tall marble screen designed by Bramante and executed under Popes Leo X, Clement VII and Paul III, by Andrea Sansovino, Girolamo Lombardo, Bandinelli, Guglielmo della Porta and others in the baroque style. The four sides represent the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Arrival of the Santa Casa at Loreto and the Nativity of the Virgin, respectively. The Hall of the Treasury The Hall of the Treasury dates from the beginning of the 17th century. It contains votive offerings, liturgical objects and vestments. The frescoes on the vaulted ceiling are exquisite examples of late Roman Mannerism and were created in 1605-1610 by Cristoforo Roncalli, known as Pomarancio.The Pilgrimage Town of Loreto: Loreto is a typical case of a shrine that created a town, at \\"Shrines of Europe\\", retrieved 10 April 2020 The architectural design is finer than the details of the sculpture. The apse is decorated with 19th-century German frescoes. Tradition Fresco by Melozzo da Forl√¨ on the dome of the Sacristy of St Marc in the Basilica =In Nazareth= Late medieval religious traditions developed suggesting that this was the house in which the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) had lived while in Judea at the start of the first century AD, and which was miraculously flown over to Europe by four angels just before the final expulsion of the Christian Crusaders from the Holy Land, in order to protect it from Muslim soldiers. According to this narrative, this is the Nazareth house in which Mary had been born and brought up, received the Annunciation, conceived Jesus through the Holy Spirit, and had lived during the childhood of Christ. The tradition holds that after Jesus's Ascension, the house was converted into a church where the Apostles placed an altar, at which Saint Peter, considered by Catholics to be the first Pope, celebrated the first Eucharist after the Resurrection, the \\"Altar of the Apostles\\" inside the \\"house\\" being venerated as the authentic one.Ferreri, Enza, Loreto Can Only Be a Miracle, at Italy Travel Ideas blog, retrieved 9 April 2020 In 336, Empress Helena made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and allegedly directed that a basilica be erected over it, in which worship continued until the fall of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. However, there is no firm historical evidence that Helena did in fact make such an intervention. =Translation to Dalmatia and Italy= The narrative further states that, threatened with destruction by Muslim soldiers, the house was miraculously carried by angels through the air and initially deposited in 1291 on a hill at Tersatto (now Trsat, a suburb of Rijeka, Croatia), where an appearance of the Virgin and numerous miraculous cures attested to its sanctity. The miraculous translation of the house is said to have been confirmed by investigations made at Nazareth by messengers from the governor of Dalmatia. In 1294, angels again carried it across the Adriatic Sea to the woods near Recanati (although the reasoning is not clear as to why this happened); from these woods (Latin lauretum, Italian Colle dei Lauri or from the name of its proprietress Laureta) the chapel derived the name which it still retains (Lat. sacellum glorios√¶ Virginis in Laureto). From this spot it was afterwards removed to the present hill in 1295, with a slight adjustment being required to fix it in its current site. It is this house that gave rise to the title Our Lady of Loreto, sometimels applied to the Virgin; the miracle is occasionally represented in religious art wherein the house is borne by an angelic host. A more detailed narrative mentions five transitions: in May 1291 from Nazareth to Tersatto, where it remained for over three years; from there to the other side of the Adriatic Sea, to Posatora (now part of Ancona) in the Marche region; after nine months to woods near Recanati in Marche; after eight months to a hill a mile away, Monte Prodo, near Loreto, where local counts petition the pope for ownership of the pilgrimage site; and finally, at the end of 1296, to the current position on the road then connecting Recanati to Porto Recanati, on public ground free of property claims. Pontifical support Bulls in favour of the Shrine at Loreto were issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1491 (although, since Sixtus IV died in 1484, either the date is erroneous, or else the pope should be Innocent VIII), and by Julius II in 1507, the last alluding to the translation of the house with some caution (ut pie creditur et fama est). While, like most miracles, the translation of the house is not a matter of faith for Catholics, nonetheless, in the late 17th century, Innocent XII appointed a missa cum officio proprio (a special mass) for the Feast of the Translation of the Holy House, which as late as the 20th century was enjoined in the Spanish Breviary as a greater double on December 10. This mass was recently restored by Pope Francis in 2019. On 4 October 2012, Benedict XVI visited the Shrine to mark the 50th anniversary of John XXIII's visit. In his visit, Benedict formally entrusted the World Synod of Bishops and the Year of Faith to the Virgin of Loreto.Pastoral visit of Benedict XVI to Loreto Benedict XVI, Prayer to Our Lady of Loreto Historicity An authority on Loreto has summed up the controversy concerning the miraculous flight of the Holy House by writing that it has attracted \\"the ridicule of one half of the world and the devotion of the other.\\" =Pro arguments= Analysis by Italian archaeologists and architects reached the conclusion that the Holy House * is built of two types of limestone found in Nazareth, but not in Loreto and Marche - as is the \\"Altar of the Apostles\\" * the mortar between the stones is typical for 1st century Palestine, but not for Italy * the graffiti on the walls are similar and contemporary to those discovered at the Grotto of the Annunciation in Nazareth * the \\"house\\" has no foundations, stands directly on dusty ground not cleared in any way and containing snail shells, acorns and a dried walnut, and even stands atop a thorny bush * the three-wall \\"house\\" fits exactly the measurements of the foundations excavated in front of the Grotto in Nazareth, and those of the \\"missing\\" wall fit the Grotto, therefore: * the Holy House and the Grotto were originally part of the same dwelling. * The Holy House is placed partly on a public road connecting Recanati with Porto Recanati, its apparition forcing the magistrates of Recanati to build a diversion of the road - this makes an intentional construction at such a location look improbable * the survival of the three-wall structure lacking foundations and placed partly on a road, partly over a ditch, defies the laws of physics. =Counter-arguments= Translation by Angelos/Angeli family In modern times, the Church traced the linguistic origins of the story to an aristocratic family called \\"Angelos\\", which were responsible for the transfer. There are 16th century bas-reliefs, which suggest that the Holy House was transported by sea. In May 1900, papal physician Giuseppe Lapponi indicated that he had read in the Vatican archives documents suggesting that the members of the noble Byzantine family named Angelos had saved the stones of the House from Muslim devastation and transported them to Loreto.La Santa Casa da Nazareth a Loreto, on the official website (in Italian). Retrieved 10 April 2020. In a second step, in late 1294, Nikephoros, ruler of Epirus from the Angelos family (in Italian: Niceforo Angeli), sent on the bricks to Italy as a wedding gift for his daughter who had married Prince Philip, the son of the King of Naples, in October that year. In both Greek and Latin, the family name Angelos/Angeli means \\"angels\\".Did angels really carry the Holy House of Mary to Loreto, Italy?, by Courtney Mares, Catholic News Agency (CNA), 10 Dec 2018. Retrieved 10 April 2020. The stones considered by researchers to be authentic are still visibly marked with Roman numerals, by scratching or with coal, which suggest that the three walls were carefully taken apart with the intention to faithfully reassemble them at another location, which actually happened. The traditional date of the miraculous translation, 12th May 1291, is compatible with the historical dates - the port city of Acre, the Crusader capital, fell six days later, theoretically allowing for the shipment of the stones, once they had been carried by cart from Nazareth to the port of Acre. Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1962-65. Among the numerous coins found underneath the building, there were two bearing the inscription \\"Gui Dux Atenes\\". Meant is Guy II de la Roche, the Regent of Athens from 1280 to 1287. His parents were the Frankish nobleman, William I, Duke of Athens, and Aromanian Greek princess Helena Angelina Komnene, the daughter of John Doukas, Prince of Thessaly, also known as John Angelos. Through his mother, Guy was related to the Byzantine families of the Komnenos and Doukas, Emperors of Constantinople and Epirus. Helena was Regent of the Duchy of Athens from the death of her husband in 1287 until her son's reaching the age of majority in 1294, covering the entire time span of the translation of the Holy House from Nazareth, to Epirus, to Recanati (Loreto). The presence of the two coins are proof that the Angelos family, known in Italian as Angeli and later as De Angeli, supervised the event. The law of Recanati categorically prohibited construction of any type of building on public roads, providing for its immediate demolition; only an intervention from a very high authority could have lead to a suspension of the law, as it obviously happened in the case of the House. Archaeological examination offered further proof for both the provenance of the stones from Nazareth, and for them being reassembled at Loreto, where several phases of support construction for the three-wall structure could be detected. Chronological issues and late origin The documented history of the house can only be traced as far back as the close of the Crusades, around the 14th century. An early brief reference is made in the Italia Illustrata of Flavius Blondus (1392‚Äì1463), secretary to Popes Eugene IV, Nicholas V, Calixtus III and Pius II; it can be read in its entirety in the Redemptoris mundi Matris Ecclesi√¶ Lauretana historia, by a certain Teremannus, contained in the Opera Omnia (1576) of Baptista Mantuanus. According to Herbert Thurston, in some respects the Lauretan tradition is \\"beset with difficulties of the gravest kind\\", which were noted in a 1906 work on the subject. There are documents which indicate that a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin already existed at Loreto in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that is, 180 years before the time of the supposed translation; and there is no mention of the supposed miraculous translation of the Holy House in 1472. Thurston notes that papal confirmations of the Loreto tradition are relatively late (the first Bull mentioning the translation is that of Julius II in 1507), but that they are at first very guarded in expression, for Julius introduces the clause \\"ut pie creditur et fama est\\", \\"as is piously believed and reported to be\\".Thurston, Herbert. \\"Santa Casa di Loreto.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 December 2017 Statue before legend theory Thurston suggests that a miracle- working statue or picture of the Madonna was brought from Tersatto in Illyria (more precisely: Dalmatia) to Loreto by some pious Christians and was then confounded with the ancient rustic chapel in which it was harboured, the veneration formerly given to the statue afterwards passing to the building. Similar Walsingham legend Finally, Thurston draws comparisons to the shrine at Walsingham, the principal English shrine of the Blessed Virgin, the legend of \\"Our Lady's house\\" (written down about 1465, and consequently earlier than the Loreto translation tradition) supposes that in the time of St. Edward the Confessor a chapel was built at Walsingham, which exactly reproduced the dimensions of the Holy House of Nazareth. When the carpenters could not complete it upon the site that had been chosen, it was transferred and erected by angels' hands at a spot two hundred feet away.\\"The Month\\", September 1901 History The basilica holding the Santa Casa was built starting from 1468. In 1797, Napoleon's troops sacked the church. The treasury was emptied, either looted by soldiers, or its contents requisitioned by the pope who needed money for the payments required by the Treaty of Tolentino, which he had signed with Napoleon. Still, by 1821 the Black Madonna had been returned from the Louvre via Rome, and the treasury was again filled with valuable offerings. Veneration and feast of Our Lady of Loreto The venerated Marian image of Our Lady of Loreto. The cedar wood was timbered from the Vatican Gardens Our Lady of Loreto is the title of the Virgin Mary with respect to the Holy House of Loreto. This name is also used her statue displayed inside the Holy House. In the 1600s a Mass and a Marian litany was approved. This \\"Litany of Loreto\\" is the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, one of the five litanies approved for public recitation by the Church. In 1920 Pope Benedict XV declared the Madonna of Loreto patron saint of air travellers and pilots. The statue was granted a Canonical Coronation in 1922 by Pope Pius XI. In October 2019 Pope Francis restored the feast of Our Lady of Loreto, commemorated on December 10, to the universal Roman calendar. In popular culture Due to Our Lady of Loreto being the patroness of aviators, Charles Lindbergh took a Loreto statuette with him on his flight across the Atlantic, and Apollo 9 carried a Loreto medallion on its flight to the moon.

It was the southernmost permanent settlement in the New Kingdom of Egypt (16th‚Äì11th centuries BC) and the main Kushite cult centre of Amun. It was the sometime capital of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and, after its fall in 663 BC, of the Kingdom of Kush. In 593 BC, it was sacked by the Egyptians and the Kushite capital was relocated to Mero√´. The city was sacked a second time by the Romans in 23 BC but was rebuilt and continued as an important centre of the Amun cult.Timothy Kendall (2001), \\"Napata\\", in Donald B. Redford, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press. The terms \\"Napata\\" or \\"Napatan period\\" can also refer to the Kushite polity from its rise around 750 BC until 270 BC, when Napata finally lost its symbolic significance as the location of royal burials to Mero√´. The subsequent period of Kushite history is called Meroitic down to the collapse of the kingdom.Richard A. Lobban, \\"Napata\\", Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia (Scarecrow, 2004), pp. 274‚Äì276. Early history Napatan necklace spacer made of gold, 6th century BC. It is inscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphs. The last standing pillars of the temple of Amun at the foot of Jebel Barkal Napata was founded by Thutmose III in the 15th century BC after his conquest of Kush. The nearby Jebel Barkal was taken to mark the southern border of the New Kingdom of Egypt. In 1075 BC, the High Priest of Amun at Thebes, capital of Egypt, became powerful enough to limit the power of Pharaoh Smendes of the post-Ramesside Twenty-first Dynasty over Upper Egypt. This was the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period (1075‚Äì664 BC). The fragmentation of power in Egypt allowed the Kushites to regain autonomy. They founded the Kingdom of Kush, which was centered at Napata. A stela erected in Napata in the eighth century presents a Kushite king (whose title has been hammered out) as the only ruler legitimated by the god Amun, appointing the kinglets and Libyan chiefs who shared Egypt at that time and derived their legitimacy from the generals' discretion. Napatan period In 750 BC, Napata was a developed city, while Egypt was still suffering political instability. Kashta, whose name is Egyptian for \\"the Kushite\\", profited from it, and attacked Upper Egypt. His policy was pursued by his successors Piye, and Shabaka (721‚Äì707 BC), who eventually brought the whole Nile Valley under Kushitic control in the second year of his reign. Overall, the Kushite kings ruled Upper Egypt for approximately one century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BC. They constitute the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho‚Äôs Aegyptiaca. The reunited Egyptian empire under the 25th dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom and ushered in a renaissance. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, and elsewhere. =Assyrian invasion and end of the Twenty-fifth dynasty= Pharaoh Taharqa's reign and that of his eventual successor, his cousin Tantamani, were filled with constant conflict with the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Around 670 BC, emperor Esarhaddon (681‚Äì669 BC) conquered Lower Egypt, but allowed local kingdoms there to exist in order to enlist them as his allies against the Kushite rulers of Upper Egypt, who had been accepted with reluctance. When King Ashurbanipal succeeded Esarhaddon, the Kushite king Taharqa convinced some rulers of Lower Egypt to break with Assyrians. However, Assurbanipal overpowered the coalition and deported the Egyptian leaders to his capital, Nineveh. He appointed the Libyan chief Necho, ruler of Memphis and Sa√Øs. Necho I was the first king of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664‚Äì525 BC) of Egypt, which is also known as the \\"Sa√Øte Dynasty\\". In 664 BC, the Assyrians laid the final blow, sacking Thebes and Memphis. The same year, Taharqa died. The new Kushite king, Tantamani (664‚Äì653 BC), killed Necho I that same year when he tried to invade Lower Egypt. However, Tantamani was unable to defeat the Assyrians, who backed Necho‚Äôs son, Psamtik I. Tantamani eventually abandoned his attempt to conquer Lower Egypt and retreated to Napata. However, his authority over Upper Egypt was acknowledged until the 8th regnal year of his reign at Thebes (or 656 BC), when Psamtik I dispatched a naval fleet to Upper Egypt and succeeded in placing all of Egypt under his control. The 25th dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to Napata. It was there (at El-Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th dynasty pharaohs are buried under the first pyramids that the Nile valley had seen since the Middle Kingdom. The Napatan dynasty continued to rule the Kushite state, which flourished in Napata and Mero√´ until at least the second century AD. Late Napatan kingdom Kushite pyramids at Nuri Napata remained the centre of the Kingdom of Kush for another two generations, from the 650s to 590 BC. Its economy was essentially based on gold, with 26th dynasty Egypt an important economic ally. Napatan architecture, paintings, writing script, and other artistic and cultural forms were in Kush style. Egyptian burial customs were practised, including the resurrection of pyramid building. Also, several ancient Egyptian deities were worshipped. The most important god was Amun, a Theban deity. The Temple of Amun and the Temple of Mut were the most important ones at Napata, located at the foot of Jebel Barkal.World Studies The Ancient World Chapter 3 Section 5 Pages 100, 101 and 102 After the Achaemenid conquest of Egypt, Napata lost its economic influence. The Napatan region itself was desiccating, leading to less cattle and agriculture. An Achaemenid raid had seriously affected Napata in 591 BC. Finally, Napata was losing its role of economic capital to Mero√´. The island of Mero√´, the peninsula formed by the Nile and the Atbarah River, was an area rich in iron, which was becoming an essential source of wealth. Meroe eventually became the capital of the Kingdom of Kush, leading to the abandonment of Napata. In 23 BC, the Governor of Roman Egypt Gaius Petronius invaded Kush with 10,000 men after an initial attack by the queen of Mero√´, razing Napata to the ground. In the Res Gestae Divi Augusti (\\"Deeds of the Divine Augustus\\"), Augustus claims that \\"a penetration was made as far as the town of Napata, which is next to Meroe.Augustus, \\"The Deeds of the Divine Augustus,\\" Exploring the European Past: Texts & Images, Second Edition, ed. Timothy E. Gregory (Mason: Thomson, 2008), 119. After the Roman sack, Napata was restored by King Natakamani, who renovated the temple of Amun and constructed a palace. Later, the site was abandoned, its buildings plundered and destroyed. There is circumstantial evidence that this may have been the result of religious changes.Alessandro Roccati (2003), \\"Napata, the Destroyed City: A Method for Plundering\\", in M.

It was his first domestic honour in the game. =Manchester City= In the 1977 close season, Channon left Southampton ‚Äî still in the Second Division ‚Äî to join Manchester City in a ¬£300,000 deal. His new club were making progress, having just finished second in the First Division behind champions Liverpool, but this was where they peaked and Channon struggled to settle. He scored just 12 goals in his first season and 11 in his second. =Return to Southampton= Channon went back to Southampton (by now back in the First Division) in September 1979. Now in his thirties, he continued to play regularly though his goals ratio was not good in his second spell, with only ten coming in each of his first two seasons back at the club. He joined Newcastle United in 1982 after playing 510 games for Southampton over two spells, scoring a total of 185 goals placing him top of the club's list of all-time goalscorers. =After Southampton= He lasted barely a month at Newcastle before joining Bristol Rovers. His impressive career seemingly on the decline, he failed to score in nine games for Bristol Rovers before a sudden departure again, this time to Norwich City where, at the age of 34, he found some of his old touch. He played 88 games over three seasons, scoring 16 goals, and suffered a mixed end to his Norwich career in 1985 when the club won the League Cup ‚Äî Channon's second and final domestic honour ‚Äî with a 1‚Äì0 win over Sunderland at Wembley, but were then relegated (with Sunderland) at the end of the same season. Channon joined Portsmouth and Finn Harps (where he played in one League of Ireland Cup game), before retiring from the game in 1986. =England= Called up to make his debut for England by Alf Ramsey in October 1972, Channon played well enough in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Yugoslavia at Wembley to be selected for the squads for two subsequent qualifying matches for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, although he wasn't eventually in the team for either. However, he won his second cap in a famous 5‚Äì0 hammering of Scotland at Hampden Park in February 1973, scoring his first goal in the process. As the year progressed, Channon scored again in a match against Wales and then added a brace in a 7‚Äì0 thumping of Austria before he was picked by Ramsey for his first competitive match - a crucial and ultimately infamous World Cup qualifier against Poland at Wembley. If England didn't win, they wouldn't qualify for the tournament. Channon, in his tenth England outing, was in an attacking line-up which spent pretty much the whole match in the Poland half, trying to break the deadlock. Channon saw his own chances saved by the eccentric but inspired goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski and the game ended 1‚Äì1. He played in a series of post-season friendlies for England, scoring in three of them and was kept in the side the following October as England began their campaign to qualify for the 1976 European Championships. Channon scored in the game against Czechoslovakia as England won 3‚Äì0. Channon's next goal for England was a while coming ‚Äî in September 1975 ‚Äî as England beat Switzerland in a friendly. England had two qualifying games left at the end of the year for the 1976 European Championships and Channon scored in both, but England lost 2‚Äì1 to the Czechs in Bratislava and then only drew 1‚Äì1 with Portugal in Lisbon. England failed to qualify and the Czechs went on to win the tournament. After winning an FA Cup medal in the 1976 Final, Channon was back at Wembley days later to score twice in England's 4‚Äì0 win over Northern Ireland; he then scored again four days later against Scotland but England lost 2‚Äì1 at Hampden Park. There followed a summer tournament in the U.S. for the bi-centennial celebrations, and Channon scored twice in a thrilling game against Italy as England came from two goals down to win 3‚Äì2. A fortnight later, Channon scored again as England defeated Finland 4‚Äì1 in Helsinki to get their qualification campaign for the 1978 FIFA World Cup off to a perfect start, though this would be tempered a month later by a defeat against Italy in Rome. In March 1977, Channon scored twice as England beat Luxembourg at Wembley to get their World Cup campaign back on track; Luxembourg were the 'whipping boys' of the group and England would later need to demolish Luxembourg by a similar or better scoreline in Luxembourg to give themselves a chance of overhauling Italy and qualifying for the World Cup. Channon hit his 20th England goal in a 2‚Äì1 win over Northern Ireland in May 1977. A week later came another Channon goal against Scotland - this time from the penalty spot - but this proved an infamous England defeat as the Scots won 2‚Äì1 and their fans invaded the Wembley pitch in celebration, ripping up clods of souvenir turf and pulling down one of the crossbars. After an ill-fated move to Manchester City affected his form, Ron Greenwood chose to omit him from the starting line-up when England played the crucial World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg in October 1977. England won 2‚Äì0 and, despite victory over Italy in the last game of the campaign, the goals record was insufficient to take them to the World Cup. Channon was not selected for his country again; his international career ended with 46 appearances and a healthy 21 goals. England's failure to qualify for three major international tournaments during Channon's career leaves him as the most-capped player never to have been named to a World Cup or European Championships squad. As of 17 July 2018, he remains joint 18th in the all-time England scorers list, level with Kevin Keegan and Steven Gerrard. Football honours =As a player= Southampton * FA Cup winner: 1976 Norwich City * League Cup winner: 1985 * In 2002, Norwich fans voted Channon into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. Horse racing Channon always had an interest in horse racing during his football career. After retiring from full-time professional football in 1986, he began working as an assistant trainer, before becoming a licensed trainer in his own right in 1990. He initially had ten horses. He then moved to the West Ilsley stables near Newbury, formerly owned by the Queen, and began to increase his number of horses, eventually ending up with almost 200. In 2002, he ended the season with 123 winners, topping the 100-mark for the first time in his career. He is one of the sport's most respected trainers, though has yet to produce a winner of one of the British Classic Races. In May 2012, he produced his first Classic winner when Samitar took the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Among owners who have had their horses with Channon are old colleagues and acquaintances from his footballing days, including Kevin Keegan, Alan Ball, Chris Cattlin and Sir Alex Ferguson. =Group 1 / Grade I wins= Great Britain * Cheveley Park Stakes: Seazun (1999), Queen's Logic (2001) * Dewhurst Stakes: Tobougg (2000) * Falmouth Stakes: Music Show (2010) * King's Stand Stakes: Piccolo (1995) * Nunthorpe Stakes: Piccolo (1994) * St. James's Palace Stakes: Zafeen (2003) * Sun Chariot Stakes: Majestic Roi (2007) Canada * E.

He was travelling from the Doncaster Sales to his West Ilsley stables in Berkshire when the accident happened. Channon was reported to have suffered a punctured lung and broken arm and jaw. During an interview with Clare Balding broadcast on BBC One on 3 January 2009, Channon spoke about how, as a result of the broken jaw, he was subsequently fitted with metal plates in his face. Bloodstock agent and friend Tim Corby died in the accident. References =Bibliography= *Channon, Mick (1986). Man on the Run: An Autobiography. Arthur Barker.

It is a Papal minor basilica and one of the most important places of Christian pilgrimage in Italy. With its accompanying friary, Sacro Convento, the basilica is a distinctive landmark to those approaching Assisi. It has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2000. The basilica, which was begun in 1228, is built into the side of a hill and comprises two churches (known as the Upper Church and the Lower Church) and a crypt, where the remains of the saint are interred. The interior of the Upper Church is an important early example of the Gothic style in Italy. The Upper and Lower Churches are decorated with frescoes by numerous late medieval painters from the Roman and Tuscan schools, and include works by Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti and possibly Pietro Cavallini. The range and quality of the works give the basilica a unique importance in demonstrating the outstanding development of Italian art of this period, especially if compared with the rest of Christian Europe. History Basilica, as seen from the valley below. The Franciscan friary (Sacro Convento) and the Lower and Upper Basilicas () of Francis of Assisi were begun in honor of this local saint, immediately after his canonization in 1228. Simone di Pucciarello donated the land for the church, a hill at the west side of Assisi, known as \\"Hill of Hell\\" () where previously criminals were put to death. Today, this hill is called \\"Hill of Paradise\\". On 16 July 1228, Francis was canonized by Pope Gregory IX in Assisi, and he laid the foundation stone of the new church the following day, although construction may already have been begun. The construction having been begun at his order, the Pope declared the church to be the property of the papacy. The church was designed by Maestro Jacopo Tedesco, who was in those days the most famous architect.Francesco d'Assisi e le origini dell'arte del Rinascimento in Italia by Henry Thode The construction was supervised by Brother Elias of Cortona, one of the first followers of Saint Francis and the former Vicar General of the Order under Saint Francis. The Lower Basilica was finished in 1230. On Pentecost 25 May 1230, the remains of Saint Francis were brought in a solemn procession to the Lower Basilica from its temporary burial place in the church of San Giorgio (St. George), now the Basilica of Saint Clare of Assisi. The burial place was concealed for fear that St Francis' remains might be stolen and dispersed. The construction of the Upper Basilica was begun after 1239 and was completed in 1253. Both churches were consecrated by Pope Innocent IV in 1253. Pope Nicholas IV, a former Minister-General of the Order of Franciscans, raised the church to the status of Papal Church in 1288. The Piazza del Loge, the square leading to the church, is surrounded by colonnades constructed in 1474. They housed the numerous pilgrims flocking to this church. In 1818, the remains of Saint Francis were rediscovered beneath the floor of the Lower Basilica. In the reign of Pope Pius IX the crypt was built so that the faithful might visit the burial place of the saint. On 27 October 1986 and January 2002, Pope John Paul II gathered in Assisi with more than 120 representatives of different religions and Christian denominations for a World Day of Prayer for Peace. =Earthquake of 1997= On the morning of September 26, 1997, two earthquakes hit that region of Italy in rapid succession, registering 5.6 and 6.1 respectively on the Richter Scale. There was widespread devastation and many ancient buildings were destroyed or damaged. While a group of specialists and friars were inspecting the damage to the Basilica of Saint Francis, an aftershock shook the building, causing the collapse of the vault. Two Franciscan friars who were among the group and two of the specialists were killed. Much of the cycle of frescoes of the life of Saint Francis by Giotto in the Upper Church of the Basilica were slightly damaged whereas those of the sections of the vault which collapsed were almost entirely destroyed. The church was closed for two years for restoration. The collapse was captured on tape. Architecture The church was designed by Maestro Jacopo Tedesco on two levels, each of which is consecrated as a church. They are known as the \\"Basilica superiore\\" (The Upper Basilica), generally called \\"The Upper Church\\" and the \\"Basilica inferiore\\" (The Lower Basilica), generally called \\"The Lower Church\\". The Lower Church was structurally a large crypt supporting the upper one. In the 19th century a lower crypt was constructed beneath the basilica. Architecturally, the exterior of the basilica appears united with the Friary of St. Francis, since the lofty arcades of the latter support and buttress the church in its apparently precarious position on the hillside. Papal Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi from below The architecture is a synthesis of the Romanesque and Gothic styles, and established many of the typical characteristics of Italian Gothic architecture. As originally built, both upper and lower churches had a simple cruciform plan with an aisle-less nave of four square bays, a square crossing, a transept that projected by half a bay on each side, and an apse, the lower being semicircular and the upper polygonal. To the left of the church stands a free-standing bell tower of Romanesque design. The Lower Church was built entirely in the Romanesque style, having low semi- circular ribbed cross-vaults over the nave and barrel vaults over the transept arms. However, the space has been greatly extended with a number of lateral and transept chapels added between 1350 and 1400. The main entrance to the nave is through an ornate Gothic doorway built between 1280 and 1300, and later enclosed with a simple Renaissance style porch of 1487 by Francesco di Bartolomeo da Pietrasanta (d. 1494). Set in the tympanum of the Gothic doorway is an ornate rose window which has been called \\"the eye of the most beautiful church in the world\\" General view. The Upper Church has a fa√ßade of white- washed brick divided into two horizontal zones of about equal height, and with a simple gable of height equal to the lower zones. There is a single large doorway in the Gothic style, divided by a column and with a rose window set in the tympanum above the two cusped arches. Above the door, in the second zone is a large and ornate rose window in which most of the decorative details are Romanesque in style. Surrounding it are carved the symbols of the Four Evangelists, combining with the window to create a square composition. Above it in the gable is an ocular window. To the left of the fa√ßade and visible from both the forecourts of the Upper Church and the Lower Church is the Benediction Loggia in the Baroque style which was built in 1754, when the church was raised to the status of basilica. Internally, the Upper Church maintains Brother Elias' original simple aisleless cruciform plan. Like the Lower Church, there is a nave of four bays with ribbed cross-vaulting. Unlike that of the Lower Church, it is only the diagonal ribs which are of semi- circular form. The transverse ribs are pointed in the Gothic manner, and thus rise to the full height of the wider diagonal ribs. Each group of ribs springs from a group of clustered columns. Externally the columns and vault are supported by stout buttresses of semi-circular plan. Unlike the Lower Church, the transepts also have ribbed vaulting. There are tall Gothic windows with Geometric tracery in each bay of the nave and in the polygonal apse of the chancel. The windows of the apse are believed to have been created by German craftsmen active around Assisi at the end of the 13th century. The windows on the left hand side of the nave were made by a French workshop (1270), while those on the right hand side are attributed to the workshop of Maestro di San Francesco. These stained glass windows are among the best examples of 13th- century Italian glasswork. As is characteristic of Italian church architecture, the main decorative feature, and the main medium used for conveying the Church's message is fresco, rather than stained glass. The earliest frescoes are some of those in the Lower Church. The work proceeded with a number of different projects and appears to have involved numerous artists, some of whom are as renowned as Cimabue and Giotto, but many of whom are no longer known by name. Upper Basilica Nave of the upper basilica. This bright and spacious basilica consists of a single four-bay nave with cross-vaulted ceiling bordered with patterns of crosses and leaves, a transept and a polygonal apse. The four ribbed vaults are decorated alternately with golden stars on a blue background and paintings. The second vault is decorated with roundels with busts of Christ facing Saint Francis and the Virgin facing Saint John the Baptist. The entrance vault gives us the Four Latin Doctors of the Church: St Gregory facing St. Jerome and Saint Ambrose facing St. Augustine. These are ascribed to the Isaac Master. The choir has 102 wooden stalls with carvings and marquetry by Domenico Indovini (1501). In their centre, on a raised platform, stands the papal cathedra. Crucifixion by Cimabue The west end of the transept and the apse have been decorated with many frescoes by Cimabue and his workshop (starting in c. 1280). The magnificent Crucifixion, with Saint Francis on his knees at the foot of the Cross, stresses again the veneration of the Passion of Christ by Saint Francis. The frescoes of Cimabue soon suffered from damp and decay. Due to the use of lead oxide in his colours and to the fact that the colours were applied when the plaster was no longer fresh, they have deteriorated and have been reduced to photographic negatives. Prior to him there had been some decorations in the upper right hand section of the transept by an (anonymous) Northern Master, probably an English artist (1267‚Äì1270). He realized the two lunettes and the roundels on the west wall with paintings of the Angel and the Apostles. Another (anonymous) master, the Roman Master, painted the Isaiah and the David and the remainder of the wall under the eastern lunette. Isaac rejects Esau The upper part on both sides of the nave, badly damaged by the earthquake of 1997, was decorated in two rows with in total 32 scenes from the Old Testament (starting with Creation of the World and ending with Joseph forgives his brothers) and the New Testament (from the Annunciation to The Women at the Tomb), while the upper register of the entrance wall is covered with two frescoes Pentecost and Ascension of Jesus. Since it took about six months to paint one bay of the nave, different Roman and Tuscan masters, followers of Cimabue, have performed this series of scenes such as Giacomo, Jacopo Torriti and Pietro Cavallini. The two frescoes of the life of Isaac (Isaac blesses Jacob and Esau in front of Isaac) in the middle register of the third bay, are traditionally ascribed to the young Giotto (1290‚Äì1295) (previously wrongly ascribed to Cimabue by Vasari). But even this has been controversial. Many critics esteem these the work of the anonymous Isaac Master and his workshop. Deducing from stylistic details, attesting to his Roman background, some think that the Isaac Master may have been Pietro Cavallini or a follower. Pietro Cavallini had painted around 1290 a similar fresco Isaac blessing Jacob in the convent of the church Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome. The position of the resting Isaac looks like the same position of the Virgin in Cavallini's mosaic Birth of the Virgin in the apse of the church Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome. The Isaac Master is considered one of the first practitioners of the true fresco (buon fresco) technique, which revolutionized mural painting for the subsequent centuries.P√©ter Bokody, \\"Mural Painting as a Medium: Technique, Representation and Liturgy,\\" in Image and Christianity: Visual Media in the Middle Ages, ed. P√©ter Bokody (Pannonhalma: Pannonhalma Abbey, 2014), 136‚Äì151. https://www.academia.edu/8526688/Mural_Painting_as_a_Medium_Technique_Representation_and_Liturgy Saint Francis preaches in the presence of pope Honorius III But the most important decorations are the series of 28 frescoes ascribed to the young Giotto along the lower part of the nave. Each bay contains three frescoes above the dado on each side of the nave, two frescoes in the east galleries beside the entrance, and two more on the entrance wall. Giotto used the Legenda Maior, the biography of Saint Francis by Saint Bonaventure (1266) to reconstruct the major events in the life of Saint Francis. The prototype for this cycle may have been the (now lost) Saint Francis cycle by Pietro Cavallini in the church San Francesco a Ripa in Rome. The paintings are as vivid as if Giotto had been a witness to these events. According to Vasari, they were executed in the period between 1296 and 1304. However the authorship of Giotto is disputed, due to the ambiguous attributions given in early descriptions of this work. Many Italian critics continue to support the authorship of Giotto and his workshop. But because of small differences in style with the frescoes of Isaac, it is thought that several or even all of these frescoes were painted by at least three separate painters, using the original concept of Giotto : the Master of Legend of Saint Francis (the principal painter and probable supervisor of the cycle), the Master of the Obsequies of Saint Francis and the Cecilia Master. The first span of the ceiling is decorated with frescoes of the \\"Four Doctors of the Church‚Äú ( Jerome, Augustine, Gregory and Ambrose), attributed either to a young Giotto or to one of his followers. The third span presents four heart-shaped medallions of the Christ, Mary, John the Baptist and Francis, painted by Jacopo Torriti. The cuspidate fa√ßade of the upper basilica has a portal in Gothic style with twin doors and a beautiful rose window. Lower Basilica Side entrance to the lower basilica. Front of the basilica. Brother Elias had designed the lower basilica as an enormous crypt with ribbed vaults. He had acquired his experience by building huge sepulchres out of hard rock in Syria. The doors are surmounted by a large rose window, flanked by two smaller ones, called \\"the eye of the most beautiful church in the world\\" The decorations on the left wooden door were executed by Ugolinuccio da Gubbio (circa 1550) and those on the right door by an anonymous Umbrian artist (1573). They portray stories from the lives of Saint Francis, Saint Clare, Saint Louis and Saint Anthony. On the left wall of the porch stands the bust of Pope Benedict XIV who granted this church the title of Patriarchal Basilica and Cappella Papale. Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs theological act in 2006 of renouncing the title of \\"Patriarch of the West\\" has had the consequence of the basilica changing its name to that of the Papal Basilica of St. Francis. Entering the lower basilica, one sees at the other side of the vestibule the chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, erected about 1270. It was enlarged by Gattapone da Gubbio and decorated at the expense of Cardinal Egidio Albornoz, papal legate in charge of the Papal States (from 1350 to 1367). He was initially buried here but his body was later transferred to Toledo, Spain. The frescoes with the eight episodes from the life of Saint Catherine were painted in 1368‚Äì1369 by ‚ÄòAndreas pictor de Bononia‚Äô. This painter, called Andrea, is most probably Andrea de‚Äô Bartoli (c. 1349 ‚Äì 1369), the court artist of Albornoz (and not Andrea da Bologna, as usually, but wrongly, attributed). The saints in this chapel were painted by Pace di Bartolo d'Assisi (1344‚Äì1368). The stained glass windows are the work of Giovanni di Bonino of Assisi (mid-14th century). On the left side of the entrance is the small Chapel of St. Sebastian with a canvas by Giorgetti and episodes of the life of the saint on the walls painted c. 1646 by G. Martelli (Irene taking care of St. Sebastian; St. Sebastian before Domitian). The left wall of this chapel is decorated by some paintings by Ottaviano Nelli (15th century) and a painting of Saint Christopher (Umbrian School, 14th century). On the right side of the entrance there are two monuments by anonymous artists: in the first span, the mausoleum of Giovanni de' Cerchi, surmounted by an early 14th-century porphyry vase (a gift of a queen of Cyprus) and the mausoleum of John of Brienne, king of Jerusalem and emperor-regent of Constantinople. Above this last burial monument stands a statue of the Blessed Virgin and on its left the figure of a crowned woman seated on a lion, made by Cosmatesco (1290). The badly deteriorating frescoes on the walls and the vaults of the third section of this entrance are the work of Cesare Sermei and G. Martelli (1645). The chapel on the right side of the third section is dedicated to St. Anthony the Abbot. The niches in the wall contain the burial monuments of the Governor of Spoleto (by then part of the Papal States) Blasco Fernandez and his son Garcia, both assassinated in 1367 (anonymous local artist, 14th century). The lower basilica consists of a central nave with several side chapels with semi-circular arches. The nave is decorated with the oldest frescoes in the church by an unknown artist, called Maestro di San Francesco. They feature five scenes from the Passion of Christ on the right side, while on the left side equally five scenes from the Life of St. Francis. By this juxtaposition, the Franciscans wanted to contribute to the idea of their founder as a second Christ. They are connected by a low blue-painted ceiling decorated with golden stars. Most images on the lower walls have decayed to leave almost no trace, except on the right wall fragments of Virgin and Child with an Angel by Cimabue. These frescoes, executed in tempera on dry plaster, were completed about 1260‚Äì1263. They are considered by many as the best examples of Tuscan wall paintings prior to Cimabue. As the popularity of this church increased, side chapels for noble families were added between 1270 and 1350, destroying the frescoes on the opened walls. The first chapel on the left is the San Martino Chapel, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It was built by the Franciscan Cardinal Gentile Portino da Montefiore and was decorated between 1317 and 1319 with ten frescoes depicting the saint's life by Simone Martini. This dedication most likely referred to the Cardinal's position as Cardinal-Priest of the Basilica of St. Martin \\"ai Monti\\" in Rome, and was intended to be his burial place. It was probably incomplete at the time of Montefiore's death (October 1312), thus he was interred in the neighboring Chapel of St. Louis. Martini also painted a triptych depicting the Madonna and Child with Two Hungarian Royal Saints with a row of five attendant saints in the St. Elizabeth Chapel (southern arm of the transept). These are among the greatest Martini's works and the finest examples of 14th-century painting. Over time, however, his use of lead paint has led to the darkening of several sections of these works. Saint Martin leaves the life of chivalry and renounces the army (fresco by Simone Martini) in the San Martino Chapel. The other chapel on the left is dedicated to St. Peter of Alcantara. The chapels on the right are dedicated to Saints: *Louis of Toulouse and Stephen I of Hungary, with frescoes by Dono Doni (1575) and stained glass, attributed to Simone Martini. *Anthony of Padua, with frescoes by Cesare Sermei (1610,) *Mary Magdalene. This chapel, built by Teobaldo Pontano (the Bishop of Assisi from 1296 to 1329), contains some of the best works of the workshop of Giotto and maybe by the Master himself (about 1320). (It was wrongly attributed by Vasari to Puccio Capanna.) On the lateral walls are scenes from the Life of Mary Magdalene (above the portrait of Teobaldo Pontano), while in the vault there are roundels with busts of Christ, the Virgin, Mary Magdalene and Lazarus. The nave ends in a richly decorated semicircular apse, preceded with a transept with barrel vaulting. The frescoes in the right transept depict the childhood of Christ, partly by Giotto and his workshop and the Nativity by the anonymous Maestro di San Nicola. The lowest level shows three frescoes representing St. Francis posthumously intervening in favour of two children. These frescoes by Giotto were revolutionary in their time, showing real people with emotions, set in a realistic landscape. Maest√† with Saint Francis, by Cimabue. On the transept wall Cimabue painted an image of Our Lady enthroned and Saint Francis (1280). This is probably the nearest likeness existing, showing the actual appearance of Saint Francis. This static painting in Gothic style is in stark contrast with the lively frescoes of Giotto. This Chapel of Saint Nicholas of Bari, at the northern end of the transept, was commissioned by the papal legate Cardinal Napoleone Orsini and it contains the tomb of the cardinal's brother, Giovanni Orsini, who died between 1292 and 1294 . The funerary monument is set in a niche above the altar, with the recumbent effigy of a young man placed inside a mortuary chamber and flanked by two angels. The reliefs were carved by an Umbrian sculptor, probably of local origin. Between the tomb and the stained glass window appears a frescoed triptych attributed to Giotto's school, representing the Madonna and Child with Saint Francis and Nicholas . The cycle decorating the walls of the chapel, completed by 1307, comprises twelve scenes painted on the ceiling and on the walls illustrating the life and miracles of St Nicholas A scene of the chapel's dedication is painted above the arch of the entrance on the southern wall: the Redeemer receives the homage of Giovanni Orsini, presented by St. Nicholas, and of Napoleone Orsini, presented by Saint Francis. The stained glass windows show Cardinal Napoleone presented to Christ in the summit and his brother presented to Saint Nicholas in the zone below. At the southern end of the transept cardinal Orsini commissioned another chapel, dedicated to St John the Baptist, which was probably originally built for the tomb of Napoleone Orsini himself, but the cardinal was never buried there and the tomb remained empty . The parallel architectural arrangement of both Orsini chapels suggests that they were conceived together. However, the decorations of the chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist were never finished . Pietro Lorenzetti ( or his workshop) executed a frescoed triptych with a Madonna and Child with Saints John the Baptist and Francis. 14th century Madonna dei Tramonti by Pietro Lorenzetti on canvas. The left transept was decorated by the Sienese painter Pietro Lorenzetti and his workshop between 1315 and 1330 (attributed by Vasari to Pietro Lorenzetti and also (wrongly) to Giotto and Puccio Capanna) . This cycle of tempera frescoes are his masterworks. They depict six scenes from the Passion of Christ. The fresco of Deposition of the Cross is especially emotional. There were about 330 work- stages needed to complete this cycle. Beneath the monumental \\"Crucifixion\\" scene, Pietro Lorenzetti has executed a fresco of the Madonna and Child, accompanied by Saints John the Evangelist and Saint Francis (the so-called Madonna dei Tramonti). The fresco is accompanied by a frescoed niche containing the liturgical implements and a fictive bench. The juxtaposition of the Childhood and the Passion frescoes emphasizes the parallel between the passion of Christ and the compassion of St. Francis. Papal altar with frescoes The papal altar in the apse was made out of one block of stone from Como in 1230. Around the altar are a series of ornamented Gothic arches, supported by columns in different styles. The fine Gothic walnut choir stalls were completed in 1471 by Apollonio Petrocchi da Ripatransone, with the help of Tommaso di Antonio Fiorentino and Andrea da Montefalco. Once featuring frescoes depicting an allegory of the Crucifixion by Stefano Fiorentino (destroyed in 1622), the walls of the apse are now covered with a \\"Last Judgment\\" by Cesare Sermei di Orvieto (1609‚Äì1668). The paintings in the lunettes of the vaults (1315‚Äì20) depict the Triumph of St Francis and three allegories of Obedience, Poverty and Chastity by the so-called Maestro delle Vele (Master of the Assisi vaults), a pupil of Giotto (about 1330). The stained glass windows in this lower basilica are attributed to Giovanni di Bonino and his workshop. Crypt Tomb of Saint Francis in the crypt Halfway down the nave one can descend into the crypt via a double stairway. This burial place of Saint Francis was found in 1818. His remains had been hidden by Brother Elias to prevent the spread of his relics in medieval Europe, a story told by Jon M. Sweeney in The Enthusiast.http://italophilebookreviews.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-enthusiast- by-jon-m-sweeney.html By order of Pope Pius VII a crypt was built under the lower basilica. It was designed by Pasquale Belli with precious marble in neo- classical style. But it was redesigned in bare stone in neo-Romanesque style by Ugo Tarchi between 1925 and 1932. The ancient stone coffin with iron ties is enshrined in an open space above the altar. In 1934 his most faithful brothers were entombed in the corners of the wall around the altar: Brother Rufino, Brother Angelo, Brother Masseo and Brother Leo. At the entrance of the crypt, an urn with the remains of Jacopa dei Settesoli was added to the crypt. This woman of Roman nobility, affectionately referred to as \\"Brother Jacoba\\", was the most faithful friend and benefactress of Saint Francis. She was at his side in the Porziuncola at the hour of his death. Friary of Saint Francis Courtyard of the friary Next to the basilica stands the friary Sacro Convento with its imposing walls with 53 Romanesque arches and powerful buttresses supporting the whole complex. It towers over the valley below, giving the impression of a fortress. It was built with pink and white stone from Mount Subasio. It was already inhabited by the friars in 1230. But construction took a long time, with as result different styles intermingling : Romanesque with Gothic style. A major part was built under the reign of Pope Sixtus IV, a Franciscan, between 1474 and 1476. The friary now houses a vast library (with medieval codices and incunables), a museum with works of art donated by pilgrims through the centuries and also the 57 works of art (mainly of Florentine and Sienese schools) of the Perkins collection. The belfry, in Romanesque style, was finished in 1239.

(27 February 1830 ‚Äì 18 April 1897), was an American Presbyterian pastor, Christian leader and author. Dr. Brookes led congregations in Ohio and Missouri during a career spanning 43 years. He became a leader among his peers in the Niagara Bible Conference which led to editing The Truth: or, Testimony for Christ, a periodical. His legacy is also found in the many books, booklets and tracts he produced.  Early life and education  Brookes was born in Pulaski, Tennessee, February 27, 1830, into a family descending on both sides from clergymen. When he was very young, his father, also a Presbyterian minister, died. Brookes made his way to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he graduated in 1853.Timothy Demy, ‚ÄúJames Hall Brookes,‚Äù in Dictionary of Premillennial Theology: A Practical Guide to the People, Viewpoints, and History of Prophetic Studies, (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1996), 64-65.

Ministry and leadership  Soon after returning to Ohio, on April 20, 1854, James Hall Brookes was ordained and installed as the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Dayton. Soon he received a call to the Second Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, preaching there for the first time on February 18, 1858.David R. Williams, James H. Brookes: A Memoir. (St. Louis: Presbyterian Board of Publication, 1897), 83. Now available online: https://archive.org/details/jameshbrookes00will/page/n7 . A new congregation was \\"colonized\\" in 1864 by members from Second Presbyterian to a location at Walnut & 16th Streets where a new edifice was built. Brookes became the pastor of the resulting Walnut Street Presbyterian Church. This congregation relocated in 1879 to a new church building at the corner of Washington and Compton streets, becoming the Washington and Compton Presbyterian Church, where Brookes remained until his death on Easter Sunday, April 18, 1897.Joseph H. Hall, \\"James Hall BrookesNew School, Old School or No School?\\" in Presbyterion, 14 (Spring 1988), 35-54. Brookes had a deep knowledge of the Bible's original languages, an excellent memory, and continually read and studied the Bible.Larry D. Pettegrew, \\"The Niagara Bible Conference and American Fundamentalism. [Part 4]\\" in Central Bible Quarterly, 20, no. 3 (Fall 1977): 10-11. He believed the Bible to be perfect, inerrant, and therefore infallible and immutable.James H. Brookes, \\"The Testimony of the Bible to Its Own Integrity,\\" in Anti-Higher Criticism: or, Testimony to the Infallibility of the Bible, ed. L. W. Munhall (New York: Hunt and Eaton, 1893), 337. Now available online: https://archive.org/details/antihighercritic00munh/page/n5 . This remarkable knowledge was coupled with his ability to communicate in a highly effective manner. Benjamin B. Warfield, then professor of theology at Princeton Seminary, wrote of Brookes: \\"Large in figure, commanding in carriage, fluent and forceful in speech, fired with intense convictions, infused with emotion, whether in pulpit or on platform his oratory not only caught the attention but dominated the feelings and controlled the convictions of his audience ... [He had] the voice of a lion and the vehemence of an Elijah ... His was no an√¶mic (sic) Christianity.\\"Benjamin B. Warfield, \\"In Memoriam. James Hall Brookes.

The millennium will follow the ‚Äúresurrection and rapture‚Äú of believers and a period of ‚Äúculminating wickedness‚Äù before Christ returns with his church to reign over the earth. James Hall Brookes was considered a ‚Äúfounding father‚Äù of dispensationalism in the United States along with men like Dwight L. Moody, Adoniram Judson Gordon, C. I. Scofield, William Eugene Blackstone, and Arno C. Gaebelein. In the foreword to the Dictionary of Premillennial Theology, Mal Couch writes ‚ÄúNot all premillennialists are dispensationalists, but all dispensationalists are premillennialists.‚Äù Mal Couch, ‚ÄúForward,‚Äù in Dictionary of Premillennial Theology. (Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1996), 9. Among their beliefs, dispensationalists hold that the Bible is inerrant, verbally inspired, and must be consistently interpreted with a normal literal-grammatical-historical hermeneutic, views that were foundational for Brookes. Brookes led the Niagara Bible Conference for many years which ‚Äúhelped to spread Dispensationalism across America.‚ÄùPaul Wilkinson. ‚ÄúFor Zion‚Äôs Sake: Darby and Christian Zionism,‚Äù in Chafer Theological Seminary Journal, 13, no.2 (Fall 2008), 62. Premillennial and dispensational beliefs became incorporated in the 1878 confession of faith (Niagara Creed) that was largely written by Brookes and adopted by the Niagara Bible Conference.Pettegrew, Central Bible Quarterly 20 no. 3 (Fall 1977) 10-11.  Writings  Dr. Brookes was a prolific author, writing more than 200 books, booklets, tracts and journal articles. He was a well-known Bible teacher and the editor of The Truth or Testimony for Christ, a periodical which served, along with the journal Watchword, as the official organ of the premillennial movement until his death in 1897. Many of Brookes's writings are available digitally and as reprints.

They had five daughters. Etta Oliver Brookes lived from 1856 to 1872. Susan Mary Brookes (1861‚Äì1936) married Selden P. Spencer, who became a U.S. Senator. Sarah Lacy Brookes (1864‚Äì1886) married Ethelbert Dudley Warfield, who became president of Miami University. Judith Bertha Brookes (1866‚Äì1905) married Harry French Knight, a St. Louis financier. Olive J. Brookes (1872‚Äì1930) married David Riddle Williams who authored the 1897 James H. Brookes: A Memoir. Olive's second husband was Rev. Harris H. Gregg. Dr. Brookes died in 1897 on Easter Sunday; his wife, Susan, died in 1910. Both Dr. and Mrs. Brookes along with all of their children except Judith are buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, Saint Louis, Missouri.  Brookes Bible College  The Saint Louis Bible Training School for Lay Workers was established in Saint Louis in 1909. Subsequently, the school was renamed in honor of Dr. Brookes. It was known as Brookes Bible Institute for many years. Following its accreditation, the name was changed to Brookes Bible College. The college is now located in Saint Ann, Missouri, a suburb of Saint Louis.

HSM systems exist because high-speed storage devices, such as solid state drive arrays, are more expensive (per byte stored) than slower devices, such as hard disk drives, optical discs and magnetic tape drives. While it would be ideal to have all data available on high-speed devices all the time, this is prohibitively expensive for many organizations. Instead, HSM systems store the bulk of the enterprise's data on slower devices, and then copy data to faster disk drives when needed. In effect, HSM turns the fast disk drives into caches for the slower mass storage devices. The HSM system monitors the way data is used and makes best guesses as to which data can safely be moved to slower devices and which data should stay on the fast devices. HSM may also be used where more robust storage is available for long-term archiving, but this is slow to access. This may be as simple as an off-site backup, for protection against a building fire. HSM is a long-established concept, dating back to the beginnings of commercial data processing. The techniques used though have changed significantly as new technology becomes available, for both storage and for long-distance communication of large data sets. The scale of measures such as 'size' and 'access time' have changed dramatically. Despite this, many of the underlying concepts keep returning to favour years later, although at much larger or faster scales.  Implementation  In a typical HSM scenario, data files which are frequently used are stored on disk drives, but are eventually migrated to tape if they are not used for a certain period of time, typically a few months. If a user does reuse a file which is on tape, it is automatically moved back to disk storage. The advantage is that the total amount of stored data can be much larger than the capacity of the disk storage available, but since only rarely used files are on tape, most users will usually not notice any slowdown. HSM is sometimes referred to as tiered storage. HSM (originally DFHSM, now DFSMShsm) was first implemented by IBM on their mainframe computers to reduce the cost of data storage, and to simplify the retrieval of data from slower media. The user would not need to know where the data was stored and how to get it back; the computer would retrieve the data automatically. The only difference to the user was the speed at which data was returned. CSIRO Australia's Division of Computing Research implemented an HSM in its DAD (Drums and Display) operating system with its Document Region in the 1960s, with copies of documents being written to 7-track tape and automatic retrieval upon access to the documents. HSM in the shape of the IBM 3850 Mass Storage Facility was (according to IBM) announced in 1974. Later, IBM ported HSM to its AIX operating system, and then to other Unix-like operating systems such as Solaris, HP-UX and Linux. HSM was also implemented on the DEC VAX/VMS systems and the Alpha/VMS systems. The first implementation date should be readily determined from the VMS System Implementation Manuals or the VMS Product Description Brochures. Recently, the development of Serial ATA (SATA) disks has created a significant market for three-stage HSM: files are migrated from high-performance Fibre Channel storage area network devices to somewhat slower but much cheaper SATA disk arrays totaling several terabytes or more, and then eventually from the SATA disks to tape. The newest development in HSM is with hard disk drives and flash memory, with flash memory being over 30 times faster than disks, but disks being considerably cheaper. Conceptually, HSM is analogous to the cache found in most computer CPUs, where small amounts of expensive SRAM memory running at very high speeds is used to store frequently used data, but the least recently used data is evicted to the slower but much larger main DRAM memory when new data has to be loaded. In practice, HSM is typically performed by dedicated software, such as IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, Oracle's SAM-QFS, Versity Storage Manager, Quantum, Novell's Dynamic Storage Technology (DST) on Open Enterprise Server (OES) Linux Platform, HPE Data Management Framework (DMF, formerly SGI Data Migration Facility), StorNext, or EMC Legato OTG DiskXtender. The deletion of files from a higher level of the hierarchy (e.g. magnetic disk) after they have been moved to a lower level (e.g. optical media) is sometimes called file grooming. Use cases HSM is often used for deep archival storage of data to be held long term at low cost. Automated tape robots can silo large quantities of data efficiently with low power consumption. Some HSM software products allow the user to place portions of data files on high-speed disk cache and the rest on tape. This is used in applications that stream video over the internet‚Äîthe initial portion of a video is delivered immediately from disk while a robot finds, mounts and streams the rest of the file to the end user. Such a system greatly reduces disk cost for large content provision systems. Tiered storage Tiered storage is a data storage environment consisting of two or more kinds of storage delineated by differences in at least one of these four attributes: price, performance, capacity and function. Any significant difference in one or more of the four defining attributes can be sufficient to justify a separate storage tier. Examples: *Disk and tape: two separate storage tiers identified by differences in all four defining attributes. *Old technology disk and new technology disk: two separate storage tiers identified by differences in one or more of the attributes. *High performing disk storage and less expensive, slower disk of the same capacity and function: two separate tiers. *Identical enterprise class disk configured to utilize different functions such as RAID level or replication: a separate storage tier for each set of unique functions. Note: Storage Tiers are not delineated by differences in vendor, architecture, or geometry except where those differences result in clear changes to price, performance, capacity and function.

This is a linguistic misconception,Kenneth G. Wilson (1993) \\"The Columbia Guide to Standard American English\\", article \\"Etymological Fallacy\\" and is sometimes used as a basis for linguistic prescription. An argument constitutes an etymological fallacy if it makes a claim about the present meaning of a word based exclusively on its etymology. An etymological fallacy may involve looking for the true meaning of words by delving into their etymologies, or claiming that a word should be used in a particular way because it has a particular etymology. Occurrence and examples An etymological fallacy becomes possible when a word has changed its meaning over time. Such changes can include a shift in scope (narrowing or widening of meanings) or of connotation (amelioration or pejoration). In some cases, meanings can also shift completely, so that the etymological meaning has no evident connection to the current meaning. Ancient Greeks believed that there was a \\"true meaning\\" of a word, distinct from a common use. There is evidence that a similar belief existed among ancient Vedic scholars. In modern days, this fallacy can be found in some arguments of language purists. Not every change in meaning leads to an etymological fallacy, but such changes are frequently the basis of inaccurate arguments. An example of a word which has greatly changed its meaning is decimation, which originally referred to reduction by a tenth, but now usually means a drastic reduction or complete destruction.Oxford English Dictionary s.v. decimation, decimate Insisting that only the original meaning is \\"true\\" constitutes an etymological fallacy. Another even more obvious example is the word \\"gay,\\" which has evolved to effectively mean \\"having a sexual orientation for persons of the same gender.\\" As recently as the 1960s, it had a different meaning, generally of \\"being happy.\\" An example of that change can be noted in the last line of the theme song from the 1966 television cartoon series, The Flintstones in which it tells the viewer that \\"You'll have a gay old time.\\" The song, at that time, had absolutely no connection to sexual orientation, but again, simply meant \\"happy.\\" See also * Folk etymology * Informal fallacy * Persuasive definition References Further reading  Category:Etymology Category:Relevance fallacies ","title":"Etymological fallacy"},{"id":"1971855","text":"Big Neck Records is an independent record label founded and operated by Bart Hart.

Upon moving to Minneapolis, Prince and members of his team helped set her up with her own apartment. \\"At first, I stayed at the Sofitel, then they moved me to a nice little prairie house at the Country Suites, but I couldn't even make a cup of tea there, so they got me an apartment and rented furniture,\\" she said. At the age of 19, Prince instructed her to get on birth control thus beginning their sexual relationship. After a four-year courtship, they married on February 14, 1996. Their only child, Amiir, was born with Pfeiffer syndrome type 2 on October 16, 1996. He was unable to breathe without a ventilator and died six days after his birth. A week later, the couple were interviewed on Oprah, where they pretended their son was still alive. According to Garcia, they were unable to process his death. \\"We believed he was going to come back, that souls come back. We didn't want to acknowledge he was gone,\\" she said.

Biography James Coonan was born in 1946 in the Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan area of New York City. When Coonan was a young man, Mickey Spillane, a well-known mobster who frequently employed the kidnap-for-ransom racket of local merchants to their families, had kidnapped, pistol-whipped and severely beaten Coonan's father John, a local accountant. Author T.J. English has credited this event in several books as Coonan's motivating factor in the takeover of the Westies. Coonan was the bodyguard/apprentice of loan shark Charles (Ruby) Stein according to The New York Times article that alleged he was \\"known and feared on the West Side as a murderer and kidnapper\\". Coonan wanted more, and several West Side neighborhood thugs gathered around him, including Francis \\"Mickey\\" Featherstone. By 1976, Coonan and Featherstone were engaged in taking over Spillane's territory, culminating in the 1977 shooting of Spillane, for which Featherstone was arrested and acquitted, and the death of Stein. According to testimony given in 1987 by ex-Westies member turned informant William Beattie, Stein was killed and beheaded in 1977 in a move to erase Coonan's debt and prove the Westies power through viciousness. In 1979, Coonan was tried and acquitted for the murder of Harold Whitehead, but convicted on weapons charges and sentenced to four years in federal prison. After his release he resumed power, but in 1988 was convicted of racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and sentenced to 75 years in prison with the judge's recommendation of denying parole. Coonan was first eligible for parole in 1998. He and his wife Edna (b.1942; Julia Edna Crotty) lived in Hazlet and Keansburg, New Jersey, before his incarceration.Lubasch, Arnold H. \\"Prosecutor Says Gang Terrorized Hell's Kitchen\\", The New York Times, October 20, 1987.

The first researchers to write about this were P. T. Landsberg and J. N. Dewynne in 1997; they applied belief in the doomsday argument to itself, and claimed that a paradox results.  The paradox  If the doomsday argument's lifetime is governed by the principle of indifference and the Copernican principle then based on the length of its current existence, and assuming that it is randomly drawn from a reference class of probabilistic speculations it is 95% certain that it will be refuted before the year 2500. If the doomsday argument is not itself subject to these principles then its assumption that the human race's survival-time can be modeled using them appears to be a paradox (to Lansberg & Dewynne). Alternatively, if the doomsday argument is subject to these presumptions, then as it is expected to expire (be refuted) earlier that its own prediction for the likely survival time of humanity there is a second paradox: The predictions of a theory concerning events to occur after it has been refuted (such as human extinction) are not logically meaningful. Conversely, if the doomsday argument survives until the end of human civilization (in the year 5000, say) then it will have dramatically beaten the odds against the expectations of the Copernican principle. This can create a paradox for an argument based on probability, as shown if future scenarios are broken into three groups: # Human extinction occurs before the year 2,500 AD. # Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD and the doomsday argument is never refuted. # Human extinction occurs after the year 2,500 AD but not before the doomsday argument is refuted. The \\"quick extinction\\" in possibility 1 is considered fairly likely in those doomsday arguments using the number of births as a reference class, but comparing like-for-like we should compare the length of time the doomsday argument survives before refutation with the length of time the human race survives before extinction. Therefore, J. Richard Gott's (temporal) doomsday argument is used to calculate the probabilities of the three scenarios above: # According to Gott's doomsday argument it is extremely unlikely that the human race will become extinct before the year 2,500 AD, as this would make us extremely special observers; applying the indifference principle to the duration of the human race makes the odds around 400:1 against (0.25% chance). # If the Copernican principle applies to the lifetime of theories as well as species (depending on the reference class evidence says it does) then the chance of the (relatively young) doomsday argument surviving sustained critical analysis for the next 500 years = 22/500 = 4.4% # By eliminating the other two outcomes we are left with the third, that the human race will survive to see the doomsday argument refuted. The chance of this = 100 - (4.4 + 0.25) = 95.35% = Paradoxical conclusion = If the doomsday argument can apply to itself it can be simultaneously right (as a probabilistic argument) and probably wrong (as a prediction). Therefore, Landsberg and Dewynne argue that it is more likely that the doomsday argument is wrong (even if its logic is correct) than that the human race will become extinct in 9,000 years (which the doomsday argument calculates at around 95% likely). The interesting paradox is that the Doomsday argument is probably wrong even assuming it to be completely right (in its 95% estimate).  Extensions  In 2001 Bradley Monton and Sherrilyn Roush extended this by arguing that Gott's doomsday argument inevitably refutes itself.  Critique  This \\"meta\\"-doomsday argument application of the concept to the doomsday argument itself, requires some assumptions that are not universally accepted: # The hypothesis that the same reasoning can be applied to the lifetime of mathematical theories as can be applied to the survival time of a species. One difference is that evidence exists for the average \\"lifetime\\" of a scientific (falsifiable) prediction; there are libraries full of refuted, unrefuted, and forgotten papers published on mathematics. # The truth-value of the doomsday argument and the survival of the human race are un-correlated in the simple calculation above. # The concept that the doomsday argument is susceptible to refutation; if the doomsday argument is not falsifiable then there is no mechanism for refuting it, even if it is false. This would make it incomparable to mortal survival. (Landsberg & Dewynne say that the doomsday argument is a physical theory rather than a mathematical hypothesis, and that any such theory is inherently falsifiable, as \\"experience has shown that any theory in physics, however successful, is only an approximation to reality and will eventually be refuted and require modification.\\" )  External links  * Monton & Roush's Summary of Doomsday argument & objections Objection 4: Self-Reference Leads to Refutation argues that a deterministic interpretation of Gott's doomsday argument is sufficient to refute it when considering how its truth or falsity applies to its own expected period of (pre-refutation) survival. (A deterministic approach to a probabilistic argument is probably inappropriate though.)  Notes  A probable paradox reply in Nature from 23 October 1997 by Lansberg and Dewynne, to Gott's claim that their earlier use of his formula would also apply to the human survival time. (The reply also details the logic of the rebuttal.)

Their time in Bradford had a profound effect on their artistic development, inspiring much of their early work. They later moved to London when Noble began an MA in sculpture at the Royal College of Art, which marked the pair's entrance into the London art world.

The work Tim Noble and Sue Webster's work can be divided into the 'Light Works' and the 'Shadow Works', though Webster does not see them as completely separate. She says: The influence of music on their art, particularly punk rock, has been of great importance to them since they began their earliest collaborations: Says Noble: Adds Webster: Sir Norman Rosenthal, the former Exhibitions Secretary of the Royal Academy, writes: =Shadow sculptures= The Shadow Sculptures incorporate diverse materials including household rubbish, scrap metal and taxidermy animals. By shining light onto these assemblages they are transformed into highly accurate shadow profiles of the artists. BlainSouthern website Gagosian gallery website Miss Understood & Mr Meanor, 1997Discussing their shadow works, Webster commented: \\"Our work is incredibly unsocial. There has to be complete darkness because you need to give the light and then to take it away again.\\" Louisa Buck \\"Alchemists?\\", The Art Newspaper, 1 October 2000 Their first shadow sculpture, 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor', 1997 (right), came into existence through experimentation with the assemblage of personal items and domestic trash. The silhouettes are formed by lights shining on mounds of rubbish, which includes broken sunglasses and pin badges for rock bands. In this particular work the artist's heads are severed and impaled on stakes. The work was destroyed in the 2004 Momart warehouse fire, along with a number of other well-known works from the Saatchi Collection. BBC Online 26 May 2004 The Guardian 27 May 2004 Through their shadow sculptures they managed to fuse the abstract and the representational, a pursuit that consumed the likes of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Francis Bacon. This became even more apparent with their second major shadow sculpture, 'Dirty White Trash (with Gulls)', 1998 (left), which expanded the innovations of 'Miss Understood and Mr Meanor'. MoMA PS1 This work is composed of a new kind of self-portrait, sculpted out of six months' worth of the artists' rubbish; the remains of everything they needed to survive during the time it took to make the work. A single light source illuminates the pile of rubbish thus casting a portrait in shadow, which contrasts sharply with the materials used to create it; the artists leaning against each other, back to back, enjoying a glass of wine and a cigarette. Jeffrey Deitch, the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, writes: Another work, 'British Wildlife' was created after Noble's father died in 2000. Using his collection of taxidermy animals, it is an assemblage of forty-six birds, forty mammals, and two stuffed fish, including a whole swan and even the pet crow Noble kept as a child. The shadow formed by this mass of animals fittingly depicts back to back busts of the artists in a pose of grief.All Visual Arts website In September 2000, they were invited to participate in 'Apocalypse', the Royal Academy's follow up to the infamous Sensation exhibition of 1997. For this they presented 'The Undesirables', which comprises a mountain of detritus collected from outside Tim and Sue's house with a shadow image of the artists hovering above. Sensation's over, now it's Apocalypse. Guardian, May 2000 The appearance of a huge pile of rubbish in one of the largest galleries within the Royal Academy was intentionally radical and shocking, created to challenge viewers' assumptions about art.Louisa Buck \\"Alchemists?\\", The Art Newspaper, 1 October 2000 In 2006, an exhibition of their work was held at the Freud Museum, entitled 'Polymorphous Perverse'.Januszczak, Waldemar \\"Grotto Fabulous\\" The Sunday Times, 17 December 2006'Black Narcissus', a sculpture made of black silicone casts of Webster's fingers and Noble's penis in various states of arousal, was placed in Sigmund Freud's study next to a bust of Freud himself. When illuminated the sculpture cast a double profile portrait of the artists, illustrating how sexuality influences our perception of reality reflecting the sexuality that Freud discovered at the core of human life. Another work, 'Scarlett', 2006 (see below video on 'External link') was a \\"worktable on which numerous bizarre mechanical toys are working and seemingly in the process of being made; a nightmarish setting of repressed sexual and sadomasochistic fantasies and transgressions.\\" The Freud Museum website =Light sculptures= The light sculptures, created in tandem with their shadow investigations, are constructed out of computer sequenced light-bulbs that perpetually flash, sending out messages of, often simultaneous, love and hate. The sculptures reference the iconic pop culture symbols of Britain and America, recalling carnival shows and signage typical of working-class sea-side Britain, Piccadilly Circus, Las Vegas and Times Square. Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend From Hell, (Diptych) 2004 As with almost all of their work, many of the Light Sculptures are meant to be contradictory, and to produce conflicting feelings in the viewer. This is certainly the case with their early light sculpture, 'Toxic Schizophrenia', 1997. The relentlessly flashing heart with a knife stuck through it fuses a Christian emblem with a clich√© rock 'n' roll tattoo. As with the shadow sculptures, duality lies at its core; the work represents romance and pain, love and hate, friendship and alienation, negative and positive. The same contradictions resonate at the centre of their later work, 'Sacrificial Heart', 2008, a three-dimensional rotating version of 'Toxic Schizophrenia', which, like the earlier work, is both repellent and strangely alluring.Darwent, Charles, Review of Gagosian show, London The Independent, 6 January 2008 Gagosian Gallery website'Toxic Schizophrenia (Hyper Version)' was their first permanent public sculpture, unveiled at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver, May 2009. MCA Denver website Contradictions and irony abound in the works exhibited at the Gagosian, Beverley Hills exhibition, 'Instant Gratification', 2001. The twenty foot long revision of their original 1997 'Forever' is inextricably linked to the artist's earlier trips to Las Vegas, playing with the traditional connotations of the word, as the constantly flashing lights reinforce the idea of 'forever'. With 'A Pair of Dollars' they attempted to form an ironic response to the art market and art fairs, creating what Noble described as a 'vulgar' artwork, to demonstrate their annoyance with this system. However, he has since acknowledged the failure of this irony, due to the huge success of the piece. 'Puny Undernourished Kid & Girlfriend from Hell' (Puny Undernourished Kid shown left), represents another return to earlier work, as it derives from cartoon-like drawings that Noble and Webster had made of each other ten years before. These large neon figures are covered with neon tattoos of aggressive and forceful statements, clearly demonstrating the influence of punk rock on the artists. =Metal sculptures= 'The Crack' (2004), is one in a series of welded metal sculptures which appear at first glance as abstract works in the tradition of David Smith and Anthony Caro, while they actually work to reverse this abstraction into figuration. 'The Crack', a vertical column-like form, is possibly the most difficult of the artists' shadow works to decipher. Instead of focusing on the usual black silhouettes cast on the wall, the viewer must instead focus on the white space around the shadow, which reveals the naked bodies of the artists facing each other. This perceptual challenge brings to mind Ernst Gombrich's discussion of perception in his famous 1960 book, 'Art and Illusion'.Gombrich, Ernst Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation New York, 1960 'The Crack' displays at one moment an abstract shape that is perhaps reminiscent of a heroic mountain landscape by Clyfford Still, with its cracks and gullies; gradually we begin to perceive the full-length naked profiles of our friends approaching each other, nipples touching, as though they are about to make love again for the millionth time. =The New Barbarians= The New Barbarians, 1997-9In 1997, Tim Noble and Sue Webster commissioned a sculptor from Madame Tussauds to help them create a life-size sculpture of themselves as australopithecines. Called 'The New Barbarians' (left), the work is based upon a diorama at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, which shows a reconstruction of two early ancestors of the human species. The Chisendale Gallery website The artists produced a version of these figures overlaid with their own facial features. The sculptures are installed so that they stand in isolation in an apparently infinite space. Their hairlessness evokes conflicting connotations; they could be the first humans or the last ‚Äì cave people, or the survivors of a nuclear holocaust. Thus, the work continues the artist's concern with conflicting themes of impermanence and immortality. A year after beginning 'The New Barbarians' they made another version of the work, 'Masters of the Universe', 1998‚Äì2000. This uses the same sculptural model as the earlier work but is covered with hair. =Electric Fountain= The 35-foot tall 'Electric Fountain', constructed from steel, neon tubing and 3,390 LED bulbs, was exhibited at Rockefeller Plaza, New York, February 2008.Vogel, Carol \\"3 Coins Might Short Out This Fountain\\" The New York Times, 21 February 2008 'Electric Fountain' (see 'External links' below for video clip) represents the artist's take on the world's oldest form of public art, the fountain. Said Webster: \\"Electric Fountain mimics the tradition of a fountain as a monument found in public squares around the world, but its magic lies in the emulation of light where water should be.\\" The fountain can be seen as both a celebration of contemporary culture and an ambiguous comment on the nature of consumer society, embodying themes that are often present in the duo's work. =The Dirty House= In 2001, Tim Noble and Sue Webster bought a dilapidated early twentieth-century furniture factory in the East End of London, which would become their studio space. The artists commissioned David Adjaye to design the building, which he named 'The Dirty House', a reference to the medium they use in many of their works.Sudjic, Deyan \\"Alchemy in a dilapidated furniture factory\\" The Observer, 1 December 2002 The original brickwork was painted a dark brown, offset by two rows of window openings, and a 'floating' roof that appears to hover over the upper level of glazing and recessed decks.Bradbury, Dominic \\"From Architect to Starchitect\\" The Telegraph\\", 27 June 2007 Personal lives Noble and Webster were married on 7 June 2008.

Geography Its southern geographic location from the city's center, bounded by the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River to the north, the river's main channel to the east, and railroad tracks, including the tracks of the Baltimore Light Rail system, to the west and Baltimore Highlands, Maryland to the south. Cherry Hill is home to Baltimore's largest public housing project, Cherry Hill Homes, with over 1000 units, private homes and several other low- income apartments throughout the community. In 2014, Baltimore City Public Schools announced that Maritime Industries Academy, a high school in northeast Baltimore, was moving to Cherry Hill. This was done in part to revamp the Herring Run recreational center in Frankford, the school's neighborhood. Most Cherry Hill residents agreed with the decision to move the high school to the area, as they needed a high school for teenage residents to attend, so they can avoid long transportation hours. The high school moving took action for the start of the 2015-2016 school year. Transportation Route 26 and 71bus at the Cherry Hill Light Rail Station. The only roads leading in or out of the neighborhood are Hanover Street, Potee Street, Cherry Hill Road and Waterview Avenue. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) serves the highly populated area with the need for public transportation by bus routes 26, 71, and the already noted Baltimore Light Rail at the Cherry Hill light rail stop located on the northwest edge of the neighborhood. History The Cherry Hill neighborhood was developed fairly recently in Baltimore's history. Like Armistead Gardens the community was founded as a home for African-American veterans returning from both World War II and the Korean War. Cherry Hill was originally planned to be located in the area now known as \\"Armsteady Gardens\\", the first section of public housing was built in 1948... .Phylesha Cooper In the early and mid-1900s, Cherry Hill was home to an encampment of Roma (Gypsies) of Romanian descent. The Roma settled in Cherry Hill because it was undeveloped and on the outskirts of the city. Many of the Roma were in Fortune telling and traveled up and down the East Coast. Due to a series of antiziganist laws passed in the 1920s and 1930s that banned fortune-telling and required a $1,000 fee for nomads to enter the city of Baltimore, the Roma community left Cherry Hill, but soon returned because the laws were rarely enforced. Economy Harbor Hospital is based in the eastern edge of the neighborhood. Cherry Hill is also home to DeBaufre Bakeries, the maker of local icon Berger Cookies.

He served as the MP for the electoral district of Fredericton from 2008 to 2015, and before that was a member of the New Brunswick Legislature from 1999 to 2008. He served in the federal cabinet in various capacities from 2008 to 2013. Early life The son of Jack Ashfield and Nora Locke, he studied Business at the University of New Brunswick for two years. Political career =Provincial= Ashfield was a school trustee for a number of years and was first a candidate for the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1991 election. A Progressive Conservative, Ashfield placed third with Confederation of Regions candidate Max White being victorious. Ashfield was again a candidate in 1999 and was successful, defeating cabinet minister Joan Kingston in the riding of New Maryland. He was named deputy speaker of the Legislature. Ashfield faced Kingston again in 2003 and won again though by a closer margin. He was sworn in as Minister of Natural Resources & Energy on June 27, 2003. He was elected to a third term in 2006 in the redistributed district of New Maryland-Sunbury West, however he left the cabinet as his party formed the opposition following the election. On March 6, 2018, Ashfield ran for the Progressive Conservative nomination in Oromocto-Lincoln-Fredericton. The nomination ultimately went to Mary Wilson. =Federal= On November 7, 2007, he won the nomination to be the candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada in Fredericton for the next federal election. When the election was called, he resigned his provincial seat. He was elected in the 2008 federal election and re-elected in the 2011 federal election. Ashfield was appointed Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on May 18, 2011. Ashfield co-chaired the annual meeting of the Canadian Council of Fisheries and Aquaculture Ministers (CCFAM) in Victoria, British Columbia in 2012. Ministers discussed a range of issues such as aquaculture, aquatic invasive species, and protecting Canada's fisheries. In March 2013, Ashfield faced criticism for a photo-op during which he remarked to the teenage daughter of a constituent, \\"Grace, you‚Äôre a great cook. You‚Äôre going to make a wonderful wife for somebody.\\" Later that year, he was replaced as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, and left the Cabinet. He was defeated in the 2015 federal election. Personal life and death In October 2012, Ashfield had a heart attack and temporarily gave his role to then National Revenue Minister Gail Shea. In June 2013, Ashfield announced he had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. When he declared his candidacy for the 2015 Canadian federal election, he had beaten his cancer that had returned in Fall 2014. The Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick officially announced Keith Ashfield's death in the early afternoon of April 22, 2018.

The first, wooden, triumphal arch was built hurriedly, after Romania gained its independence (1878), so that the victorious troops could march under it. Another arch with concrete skeleton and plaster exterior of elaborate sculptures and decoration designed by Petre Antonescu was built on the same site after World War I in 1922. The arch exterior, which had seriously decayed, was replaced in 1935 by the current much more sober Neoclassical design, more closely modelled in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The new arch, also designed by Petre Antonescu and executed in stone, was inaugurated on 1 December 1936. The arch has a height of 27 metres. It has as its foundation a 25 x 11.50 metres rectangle. The sculptures with which the facades are decorated were created by famous Romanian sculptors such as Ion Jalea and Dimitrie Paciurea. Presently, military parades are held beneath the arch each December 1, with the occasion of Romania's national holiday.

DDS addresses the needs of applications like aerospace and defense, air-traffic control, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, robotics, power generation, simulation and testing, smart grid management, transportation systems, and other applications that require real- time data exchange.  Architecture  = Model = DDS is a networking middleware that simplifies complex network programming. It implements a publish‚Äìsubscribe pattern for sending and receiving data, events, and commands among the nodes. Nodes that produce information (publishers) create \\"topics\\" (e.g., temperature, location, pressure) and publish \\"samples\\". DDS delivers the samples to subscribers that declare an interest in that topic. DDS handles transfer chores: message addressing, data marshalling and de-marshalling (so subscribers can be on different platforms from the publisher), delivery, flow control, retries, etc. Any node can be a publisher, subscriber, or both simultaneously. The DDS publish-subscribe model virtually eliminates complex network programming for distributed applications. DDS supports mechanisms that go beyond the basic publish-subscribe model. The key benefit is that applications that use DDS for their communications are decoupled. Little design time needs be spent on handling their mutual interactions. In particular, the applications never need information about the other participating applications, including their existence or locations. DDS transparently handles message delivery without requiring intervention from the user applications, including: * determining who should receive the messages * where recipients are located * what happens if messages cannot be delivered DDS allows the user to specify quality of service (QoS) parameters to configure discovery and behavior mechanisms up-front. By exchanging messages anonymously, DDS simplifies distributed applications and encourages modular, well-structured programs. DDS also automatically handles hot-swapping redundant publishers if the primary fails. Subscribers always get the sample with the highest priority whose data is still valid (that is, whose publisher- specified validity period has not expired). It automatically switches back to the primary when it recovers, too. = Interoperability = Both commercial and open-source software implementations of DDS are available. These include application programming interfaces (APIs) and libraries of implementations in Ada, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Scala, Lua, Pharo and Ruby. DDS vendors participated in interoperability demonstrations at the OMG Spring technical meetings from 2009 to 2013.2011, March 2011, https://community.rti.com/content/presentation/omg-dds-interoperability- demo-20112012, March 2012, https://community.rti.com/content/presentation/omg- dds-interoperability-demo-20122013, March 2013, http://www.slideshare.net/GerardoPardo/dds-interoperability- demo-2013-washington-dc During demos, each vendor published and subscribed to each other's topics using a test suite called the shapes demo. For example, one vendor publishes information about a shape and the other vendors can subscribe to the topic and display the results on their own shapes display. Each vendor takes turns publishing the information and the other subscribe. Two things made the demos possible: the DDS-I or Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS) protocol, and the agreement to use a common model. OMG Data Distribution Service interoperability In March 2009, three vendors demonstrated interoperability between the individual, independent products that implemented the OMG Real-time Publish-Subscribe protocol version 2.1 from January 2009. The demonstration included the discovery of each other's publishers and subscribers on different OS Platforms (Microsoft Windows and Linux) and supported multicast and unicast network communications. The DDS interoperability demonstration used scenarios such as: * Basic connectivity to network using Internet Protocol (IP) * Discovery of publishers and subscribers * Quality of service (QoS) Compatibility between requester and offerer * Delay-tolerant networking * Multiple topics and instances of topics * Exclusive ownerships of topics * Content filtering of topic data including time and geographic  History  Development of the DDS specification started in 2001. It was developed by Real-Time Innovations, a US government contractor, and Thales Group, a French defense company. In 2004, the Object Management Group (OMG) published DDS version 1.0. Version 1.1 was published in December 2005, 1.2 in January 2007, and 1.4 in April 2015. DDS is covered by several US patents,US Patent US8874686US Patent US8671135US Patent US8150988US Patent US9015672 among others. The DDS specification describes two levels of interfaces: * A lower data-centric publish-subscribe (DCPS) level that is targeted towards the efficient delivery of the proper information to the proper recipients. * An optional higher data local reconstruction layer (DLRL), which allows for a simple integration of DDS into the application layer. Other related standards followed the initial core document. The Real- time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol Specification ensured that information published on a topic using one vendor's DDS implementation is consumable by one or more subscribers using the same or different vendor's DDS implementations. Although the specification is targeted at the DDS community, its use is not limited. Versions 2.0 was published in April 2008, version 2.1 in November 2010, 2.2 in September 2014, and 2.3 in May 2019. DDS for Lightweight CCM (dds4ccm) offers an architectural pattern that separates the business logic from the non-functional properties. A 2012 extension added support for streams.DDS for Lightweight CCM (dds4ccm), Version 1.1, formal/2012-02-01, February 2012, http://www.omg.org/spec/dds4ccm/1.1/PDF/ A Java 5 Language PSM for DDS defined a Java 5 language binding, referred to as a Platform Specific Model (PSM) for DDS.

Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS (DDS-XTypes) provided support for data-centric publish-subscribe communication where topics are defined with specific data structures. To be extensible, DDS topics use data types defined before compile time and used throughout the DDS global data space. This model is desirable when static type checking is useful.Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS (DDS-XTypes), 1.0, formal/2012-11-10, November 2012, http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes/1.0/PDF A Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile specified DDS domains and topics to be part of analysis and design modeling.UML Profile for Data Distribution, version: 1.0, http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/10-05-17.pdf This specification also defined how to publish and subscribe objects without first describing the types in another language, such as XML or OMG IDL.DDS-Java: Java 5 Language PSM for DDSVersion 1.0, ptc/2012-12-01, March 2013 http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-Java/1.0/Beta3/PDF An interface definition language (IDL) was specified in 2014 independently from the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification chapter 3.

The company was one of the three founding companies of Viking Line. Rederi AB Slite went bankrupt in 1993. History =Early history= Rederi AB Slite was founded by Carl Bertil Myrsten together with his siblings Inga Gattberg, Sven Myrsten and Lars Myrsten in 1947. The oldest brother Robert Myrsten had his own shipping company Rederi AB Robert Myrsten and was not part of Rederi AB Slite. The Myrsten family, from Slite on the island of Gotland, had been in the shipping business since 1867, when Johan Niclas Myrsten founded the dynasty. In mid-1950s two newbuilt cargo ships, and were delivered to Slite. In 1959 and 1961 respectively they were rebuilt to be able to load cars and take passengers. These ships were then put on a route between Simpn√§s north of Stockholm and Mariehamn on √Öland. In 1964 the company's first purpose built ferry was delivered. In the early 1960s there was a heavy competition from several companies on the route Sweden - √Öland. This led to a cooperation between Slite and Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen, which later became a part of Rederi Ab Sally. In 1966 the marketing company Viking Line was founded and by now √Ölandsf√§rjan Ab, later SF Line, had joined the cooperation. Viking Line initially had three ships, √Ölandsf√§rjan Ab's , Vikinglinjen's and Slite's Apollo. Since the name of the marketing company came from one of the other founding companies, Carl Bertil Myrsten demanded that the colour of Viking Line's ships would originate from his company. The discussion regarding colour ended when Inga Gattberg took her favourite lip stick and made a mark on the contract with the words ‚ÄúThis is the colour we are going to use‚Äù. All Viking Line's ships were therefore painted in Apollos original red colour that now is so characteristic for Viking Line. =Growing period= During the 1970s and 1980s, ferry traffic between Sweden and Finland expanded heavily. In 1970, Slite's second was delivered from Jos L Meyer in West Germany. Her sister entered service two years later. Due to the increasing internal competition between the three companies within Viking Line, the original route between Kapellsk√§r and Naantali was clogged with Viking Line ships during the first years of the 1970s. The companies tried new routes for their increasing fleets. Rederi Ab Sally and SF Line started traffic between Stockholm and Turku, and Sally also acquired two ships for the Stockholm-Helsinki route. Slite in turn chose to start 24-hour cruises between Stockholm and Mariehamn with the venerable SS Svea Jarl, purchased in 1976 from Silja Line and renamed . To finance the purchase, the 1970-built Apollo was sold. In 1979, Diana was replaced by the new building . For a couple of years, Diana II serviced on the Stockholm-Turku route but Sally pushed her back to Kapellsk√§r-Naantali with their bigger . =Heavy expansion= Economic difficulties plagued Rederi Ab Sally in the early 1980s. Despite having the big Viking Sally on the Stockholm - Turku route plus two new large ships on the capital route between Stockholm and Helsinki, Sally was not able to invest in more new ships. This left a spot open for Slite and SF Line to take over the capital route. In 1986, Slite's , at the time the largest passenger ferry in the world, was put into service between Stockholm and Helsinki, replacing Sally's the . In October 1987 Rederi Ab Sally was sold to Effoa, the main owner of rival company Silja Line. The situation of having the main competitor owning 33% of Viking Line became untenable and Sally's shares of Viking Line were sold to Slite and SF Line. Sally's remaining ship in Viking Line service, the Viking Sally, was chartered to Slite for the next three years. Around the same time, SF Line and Slite ordered new ships again. Slite's replaced the Apollo III in 1989 and by 1990 it was time for the Viking Sally to be replaced with Athena's sister, the . The Olympia was scheduled for replacement in 1993 when the jewel of the company's crown, the world's largest passenger ferry, was to be delivered. =Crisis and bankruptcy= The timing of ordering of new expensive cruise ferries couldn't have been worse for Rederi AB Slite. In October 1989, just weeks after the order of the Europa was signed, the Finnish shipyard W√§rtsil√§ Marine went bankrupt. W√§rtsil√§ had built the Athena for Slite and was about to finish her sister, the Kalypso. The bankruptcy resulted in an increased cost for the Kalypso, about 200 million SEK. Matters became worse when the Swedish krona was allowed to float in the autumn of 1992. Because of this, the almost finished Europa built in Germany, suddenly became 500 million SEK more expensive. Slite became unable to pay for the Europa when their bank Nordbanken, which at the time had large sums invested in Slite's main rival Silja Line, withdrew their loan guarantees. After the loss of Europa, Slite had lost over 550 million SEK within two years, 200 million due to the increased costs for the Kalypso and 350 million lost in advance payments for the Europa. Consequently, Slite was declared bankrupt in April 1993. =Aftermath= All Slite's ships were sold by compulsory auction after the bankruptcy. SF Line made bids on the Athena and the Kalypso but lost them to the heavily investing Malaysian cruise company Star Cruises. SF Line became the sole owner of Viking Line and changed its name to Viking Line Ab. After the auction of Slite's ships and other assets, it became clear that the bankruptcy was unnecessary. All the debts could be paid for with the money gained from the ship sales. It has been speculated that Nordbanken did everything they could to break Slite in order to help their financially poor Silja Line. In March 1993 the Europa entered service for Silja Line as the . The company was then forced to sell all of its fleet. One of their largest vessels (MS Olympia) was sold to Irish Continental Group and chartered out to P&O; Ferries where it was renamed Pride of Bilbao. It operated at P&O; for 17 years until 2010.

It was built as a day and night fighter station within 10 Group RAF Fighter Command. The aerodrome became a sector station in October 1941, taking on the responsibility for the air defence of South and West Wales including shipping in the Bristol and St George's Channels. The aerodrome fulfilled a variety of military roles during the Second World War, with the addition of an Armament Practice Camp in October 1943 which expanded into an Armament Practice Station in July 1945 following which it went into 'care and maintenance' in October 1946. Finally decommissioned by the RAF in spring 1949, private flying started in July 1949 with the formation of Swansea Flying Club at the renamed Fairwood Common Airfield. The airfield hosted a number of air races and motor/motorcycle races but it was not until 1957 that Swansea Corporation allowed Cambrian Airways to run the airport for them on a commercial basis. Renamed Swansea Airport, it was officially opened on 1 June 1957 with Cambrian Airways inaugural flight arriving from Jersey. Then in the following 12 years, a variety of airlines operated through the airport with varying degrees of success. Cambrian Airways operated services to Jersey and Guernsey; and Morton Air Services operated a service to Gatwick. Scheduled regular flights then ceased in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, only ad hoc and summer charter flights continued to operate, mainly by Dan Air/Skyways. The 1990s saw the arrival of Heli-air Wales to the airport, and so began the era of Helicopter Training in South Wales. In April 2000, Swansea entrepreneur Martin Morgan via his company Jaxx Landing Ltd., bought the remaining lease. Ambitious plans were put in place to upgrade the then run-down facilities. The airport changed ownership again in 2003, when the Morgans sold their interest in the airport to Swansea Airport Limited, owned by Air Wales owner and director Roy Thomas, who was appointed CEO of the airport company. Runway 04 from the cockpit of an aircraft about to land With the take over of the airport by Jaxx Landing, activity at the airport began to increase: the Welsh Air Ambulance service based a MBB B√∂ 105 helicopter at the airport in March 2001. In August 2001, gliders of 636 VGS moved from Aberporth back to Swansea Airport. In March 2016 636 VGS was disbanded and the Wales Air Ambulance helicopter moved to a new base in Dafen, Llanelli at the end of May 2016 Air Wales used the airport between October 2001 and October 2004, offering flights to Dublin, Cork, Amsterdam, Jersey and London. However, the venture was not successful. After 18 months of operation, Air Wales's owner Roy Thomas had invested more than ¬£3.25 million of his personal fortune into the airport. The venture received only one tenth of the passengers needed to make the business viable. The final straw came when the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority demanded that the airport's landing lights be improved at a cost of ¬£350,000. Roy Thomas decided to pull out of Swansea Airport and concentrate Air Wales's operations at Cardiff International Airport instead. Since 29 October 2004, there have been no scheduled flights operating from the airport. From 2008 to 2011 the airport was the base for the Yak-52 formation aerobatic team 'Team Osprey'. In Spring 2014 a new formation aerobatic team was formed at the airport with Vans aircraft, Team Raven displaying in the 2014 and 2015 air show seasons with 5 aircraft increasing to 6 by mid-July 2016. Development of the airport The Welsh Assembly Government is conducting studies into improving the facilities at the airport as part of the transport infrastructure development strategy for the whole of Wales. These improvements may require some public sector support. Development proposals include: a new terminal building, new hangars, upgraded operating facilities, new fencing and a new access road. Welsh Assembly: Development of and Air Transport Strategy for Wales Stage 2 Part 1: Welsh Airports Infrastructure AppraisalWelsh Assembly: Development of an Air Transport Strategy for Wales: Stage 4 ‚Äì Strategies to Deliver intra Wales Air Services There has been widespread local opposition against the idea of further development of the airport. The main concerns are: the impact on the internationally important Special Area of Conservation which almost surrounds the airport; noise from the increased number of flights at the airport; and the negative impact of the development of the airport on the local scenery, since Gower is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In addition, the undulating and boggy common land beyond the airport perimeter fence to the North East makes extension of the runway (Runway 04/22) difficult.

It is caused by mutations in the Norrin cystine knot growth factor (NDP) gene, which is located on the X chromosome. In addition to the congenital ocular symptoms, the majority of patients suffer from a progressive hearing loss starting mostly in their 2nd decade of life, and some may have learning difficulties among other additional characteristics. Patients with Norrie disease may develop cataracts, leukocoria (a condition where the pupils appear white when light is shone on them), along with other developmental issues in the eye, such as shrinking of the globe and the wasting away of the iris. Around 30 to 50% of them will also have developmental delay/learning difficulties, psychotic-like features, incoordination of movements or behavioral abnormalities. Most patients are born with normal hearing; however, the onset of hearing loss is very common in early adolescence. About 15% of patients are estimated to develop all the features of the disease. Due to the X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, Norrie disease affects almost entirely males. Only in very rare cases, females have been diagnosed with Norrie disease; cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported. It is a very rare disorder that is not associated with any specific ethnic or racial groups, with cases reported worldwide (including cases in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australasia). While more than 400 cases have been described, the prevalence and incidence of the disease still remains unknown. Presentation The most prominent symptoms initially observed in Norrie disease are ocular (affect the eye). Initial characteristics are usually identified at birth or in early infancy, with parents often noticing abnormal eye features or that their child fails to show a response to light. The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflection that originates from a mass of disorganized tissue behind the lens. This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma. However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and unremarkable iris, anterior chamber, cornea and intraocular pressure. Over the first few months of life, complete or partial retinal detachment evolves. From infancy through childhood, the patient may undergo progressive changes in the disease. Disease progression often includes vitreoretinal hemorrhages, the formation of cataracts, deterioration of the iris with adhesions forming between the iris and the lens or the cornea, and shallowing of the anterior chamber which may increase intraocular pressure, causing eye pain. As the situation worsens, there is corneal opacification, where the cornea becomes opaque, and band keratopathy. Intraocular pressure is lost and the globe shrinks. In the last stage of Norrie disease, the globes appear small and sunken in (phthisis bulbi) and the cornea appears to be milky. Auditory symptoms (affect the ear) are common with Norrie disease. Progressive hearing loss has been reported to occur in 85‚Äì90% of patients and onset is generally in childhood and before the patient reaches their mid-20s. Early hearing loss is sensorineural (caused by damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve), mild and asymmetric. By adolescence, high-frequency hearing loss begins to appear. Hearing loss is severe, symmetric, and broad-spectrum by the age of 35 years. However, studies show that while hearing deteriorates, the ability to speak well is highly preserved. The slowly progressing hearing loss is more problematic to adjust to than the congenital blindness for most people with Norrie disease. = Additional Characteristics = Individuals with Norrie disease can also have cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Developmental delay or learning difficulties are present in about 30 to 50% of males who have Norrie disease. Psycho-social disturbances and poorly characterized behavior abnormalities may also be present. In a study reporting extraocular manifestations in 56 patients with Norrie disease, conditions reported included cognitive impairment (28% of patients), behavioral issues, for example autism spectrum disorder (27% of patients presented with autism or autism-like disorders), neurological features, including seizure disorders and epilepsy (16% of patients reported seizures or seizure history), and peripheral vascular disease (38% of patients). Additionally, children with visual impairment have been shown to struggle establishing regular sleep/wake cycles due to reduced light perception impacting on their understanding of night and day; this can impact on the individual‚Äôs behavior, mood and cognitive ability. Consistent with this, some case reports of Norrie disease patients have reported the presence of sleep disorders. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) has also been associated with Norrie disease. In a study of 56 patients with Norrie disease, 21 patients (38%) reported PVD (including varicose veins, peripheral venous stasis ulcers and erectile dysfunction). Due to the known role of the protein norrin in the vascular development of the eye and inner ear, as well as the association with PVD, norrin is thought to have an important angiogenic role in the body.  Genetics  X-linked recessive inheritance. Norrie disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NDP gene, located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men will not have the mutation, while all of their daughters will be genetic carriers of the mutation. Female carriers usually show no clinical symptoms, but will pass the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters with the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms. Females are very unlikely to express clinical signs. However, there have been a few rare cases where females have shown symptoms associated with Norrie disease such as retinal abnormalities and mild hearing loss. Additionally, cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported. One possible scenario that could lead to a female case of Norrie disease is if both of their copies of the NDP gene bear mutations, which could be the case in consanguineous families or due to a spontaneous somatic mutation. Another explanation for affected females could be skewed X-chromosome inactivation. In this latter case, carrier females with one mutated NDP allele could have a higher proportion of defective norrin being expressed, leading to the presentation of symptoms of Norrie disease. = The NDP gene = Norrie disease is caused by a mutation in the Norrin cystine knot growth factor gene, also known as the Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) gene or NDP gene. Mutations could include splicing or mis-sense mutations, as well as partial or full gene deletion. The normal function of the NDP gene is to produce the instructions for creating a protein called norrin. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin is believed to be crucial. Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a blood supply to the inner ear and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory function is interfered by the mutation of NDP. This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells in the back of the eye. When norrin's role in the establishment of blood vessels supplying the eye is disrupted, the tissues cannot develop properly. Norrin is not only important in the development of the eye. The mutation of the NDP gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the NDP gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring MAO genes. When the mutations simply change a single amino acid in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the NDP mutation does not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying exactly the same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the cysteines forming the putative cystine knot), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.  Diagnosis  Norrie disease and other NDP related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 95% of affected males. Clinical diagnoses rely on ocular findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish- yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8‚Äì10 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris atrophy, shallowing of anterior chamber, and shrinking of the globe. Children with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all. In addition to its use for initial diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is used to confirm diagnostic testing (such as diagnosis by ocular examination), for carrier testing females, prenatal diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 95% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis. Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are submicroscopic deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is linkage analysis, which is used when the first two types are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease. MRI is often used to diagnose the retinal dysplasia that occurs with the Norrie disease. However, the retinal dysplasia can be indistinguishable on MRI from persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, or the dysplasia of trisomy 13 and Walker‚ÄìWarburg syndrome. For families with an existing history of Norrie disease, genetic counselling and in utero diagnosis of Norrie disease may be considered. In utero diagnosis has been reported to include genetic testing by amniocentesis and ultrasonography to examine fetal eyes. Confirmation of diagnosis on the first day of life by ophthalmological examination under anesthesia has also been reported in some cases. Management Ocular, auditory and behavioral management are the most common areas of intervention and treatment for patients with Norrie disease. For ocular (eye) management, often patients already suffer from complete retinal detachment at birth, or by the time of diagnosis, so surgical intervention is often not offered. However, there is some evidence for the benefit of early surgery or laser therapy for cases where retinal detachment is incomplete. Surgery may also be used to treat increased intraocular pressure and in rare cases enucleation (removal) of the eye is considered to control pain. A high proportion (85‚Äì90%) of individuals with Norrie disease experience progressive hearing loss in their second decade of life. In most cases, use of hearing aids has been shown to be effective into middle or late adulthood. For more significantly impaired hearing, cochlear implants may also be considered. 30-50% of individuals with Norrie disease have been reported to present with developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Additionally, behavioral issues have also been reported. Supportive intervention and therapy, for example working with speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, can be used to maximize educational opportunities for these individuals. Furthermore, training of teachers and school counselors on how to best support children with vision and hearing impairment can be extremely beneficial. Routine monitoring of individuals with Norrie disease is recommended to best manage the disease. This includes regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist, even when vision is severely compromised. Additionally, due to the high proportion of individuals with Norrie disease who develop hearing loss, regular monitoring of hearing loss is beneficial to allow any hearing loss to be detected early and then correctly managed. More recently, the use of dual sensory clinics has been proposed to provide improved care to patients living with conditions such as Norrie disease. For example, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London are building a new Sight and Sound center, with the aim of improving the patient experience for individuals with conditions such as Norrie disease. The benefits of dual sensory clinics include improved communication between the different health care professionals (HCPs) involved in management of Norrie disease (e.g. ophthalmologists and audiologists) as well as allowing more consistent training of staff on best practices for managing and interacting with individuals suffering from sensory impairment. Individuals with Norrie disease can often feel isolated from society due to difficulties in communication. In cases where hearing loss is also experienced, this psychological burden has been shown to increase. For example, a number of Norrie disease patients have been reported to experience transient depression correlating with the onset of hearing loss. Because of this, the provision of emotional support to individuals with Norrie disease can be as important as clinical treatment strategies in terms of improving their quality of life and reducing disease burden.  Research  Research into understanding Norrie disease and how to improve the lives of those with Norrie disease is ongoing. For example, research is taking place at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London (UCL GOSICH) to study the developmental changes in the ear and eye in Norrie disease, with the hope to understand how to improve current treatment strategies. The group at UCL GOSICH is focusing particularly on the hearing loss aspect of the disease, and whether it might be possible to treat by gene therapy.  History  In 1961, a Danish ophthalmologist named Mette Warburg reported on a Danish family that showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first member of the family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. The physician had suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells had already begun to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855‚Äì1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.. Retrieved 13 February 2007. The NDP gene was previously named the ‚ÄúNorrie disease (pseudoglioma)‚Äù gene, which is still used widely when referring to NDP. However, the current approved name for NDP is ‚ÄúNorrin cystine knot growth factor‚Äù.  Culture  There are two patient organizations for people affected by Norrie disease. The Norrie Disease Association (NDA) was founded in 1994 and is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to provide information and support to people living with Norrie disease and their families. The NDA holds a conference on Norrie disease every three years in Boston, US. The Norrie Disease Foundation (NDF) is a UK-based charity established in 2016. The main aims of NDF are to provide support for families and promote pioneering research into Norrie disease. They organize two family days a year where families with Norrie disease can come together to share experiences, meet each other and build relationships and supportive networks. The websites for both patient organizations contain useful information for patients and their families about the disease.

It hosted a number of Axis prisoners, mainly German, and was the scene of the largest escape attempt by German POWs in Britain during World War II. Near the end of the war it was renamed Special Camp XI and used to detain many senior SS military leaders who were awaiting extradition to the Nuremberg trials.  Early history of the camp  Island Farm Camp was originally built as a hostel for female workers employed at a munitions factory in Bridgend, but conditions at the hostel were so dreary that the women preferred to travel, as much as , from their homes each day. The camp remained empty until 1943, when it was used to accommodate American troops who would subsequently be involved in the Allied invasion of France. After the invasion the authorities had to find suitable accommodation for large numbers of POWs captured in Europe. The prefabricated concrete huts surrounded by open fields at Island Farm were considered ideal, although the barracks had to be converted and barbed wire fences erected. This work had not been completed by the time the first batch of prisoners arrived, so the prisoners were put to work completing the conversion.southwalespolicemuseum.org, Island Farm Prisoner of War Camp, Bridgend Island Farm was designated as Camp 198 and was to hold almost 2,000 prisoners. The first POWs were a mixture of Italian and German troops, but the War Office soon decided that the camp was too comfortable for enlisted men and that German officers should be held there. The first officer prisoners arrived in November 1944.  'The German Great Escape'  Soon after their arrival at Island Farm the POWs began escape efforts, with two tunnels being dug in the camp. The first was discovered in January 1945, but the second escaped detection and on 10 March 1945, 70 prisoners escaped through a tunnel dug from Hut Nine (the only hut now left standing). The tunnel was about long and breached the perimeter fence. Some of the techniques used by the inmates were ingenious and not too dissimilar to those in the war film The Great Escape about Allied POWs. Excavating the tunnels was not easy because of the heavy clay soil upon which the camp was built. Cans, meat tins, and even knives from the canteen were used as digging implements. The soil was hauled out of the tunnel on a makeshift skip and put into kit bags. At first, prisoners carried the soil in their pockets to the long-jump pit or garden plots. Others kneaded clay into balls and dropped them through a hole in a false wall they had constructed in an unused room in one of the huts. To support the tunnel roof, oak benches were stolen from the canteen and bed legs were cut down when supplies of wood were depleted. A ventilation pipeline was made from condensed milk tins; air was forced through by a hand-operated fan. The tunnel even had its own electric lights, tapped off the mains supply. Noise was concealed by chorus singing.education.gtj.org.uk Island Farm POW camp, Bridgend, 1939-45 The escapees were divided into groups, each of which was equipped with a map, homemade compass, and food. Each person in the group also had identity papers, produced in the camp. All these preparations required tremendous organization, yet it is not known who actually organized the escape. For security purposes, each escaper‚Äôs identity was known only to the others in his small group. This anonymity protected them against betrayal and prevented discovery of the full extent of the escape. At around 10pm on March 10, the prisoners made their move; a few stole the local doctor's car and got as far as Birmingham, at least away, and another group got to the port of Southampton. The prisoners knew their way around through crude but accurate drawings of Wales and the surrounding area, mainly of railway lines and principal roads.BBC, Exploring the Island Farm Prisoner of War Camp, BBC Wales History, 21 September 2012 In his book, The German Great Escape, Peter Phillips claims that 84 prisoners actually got out, eclipsing the 76 Allied POWs who broke out of Stalag Luft III; the inspiration for the film The Great Escape. Fourteen were captured very soon afterwards, allowing officials to announce, for propaganda reasons, that only 70 had escaped. All the escapees were eventually recaptured, although this is also disputed by Phillips, who claims that three escapees spotted in Kent were never caught.  After the escape  Only three weeks after the escape, on 31 March 1945, the authorities suddenly transferred all 1,600 officers out of Island Farm Camp. It was then designated Special Camp Eleven and was prepared to receive senior German officers, many of whom had been captured in France and were awaiting trial at Nuremberg. In all there were 160 officers holding the rank of general, admiral, or field marshal, including a number of Hitler's closest advisers: * Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, commander in chief of the German armies in the campaign against France in 1940 (because of his status, von Rundstedt received certain privileges at the camp, including his own private suite, consisting of a sitting room and bedroom). * Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who established the operation plans for Hitler's successful campaign in the west and commanded the Eleventh Army, which conquered the Crimea and Sevastopol on the eastern front. * Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch, who was named commander in chief of the German army by Hitler in 1938 and who was instrumental in the planning and execution of attacks on Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Soviet Union. * Field Marshal Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist, who was involved in the Battle of Paris and was in charge of Army Group A from 1942 until 1944. * Generaloberst Heinrich von Vietinghoff, Supreme Commander of the 10th German Army in Italy, 1943 to 1945, which the Germans referred to as the Southwestern Front. * Generaloberst Gotthard Heinrici, commander of Army Group Vistula, who defended Berlin against three Red armies in the last battle of the European theater. * Vice-Admiral Friedrich Frisius whose garrison held out in Fortress Dunkirk until the very end of the war. Island Farm Camp finally closed in 1948, when the last prisoners were returned to Germany. In 2016, an archaeology investigation was undertaken of the site to look for the escape tunnel, including surface surveying using lidar and geophysics. An intrusive investigation found the tunnel to be in relatively good condition, still containing the wooden support shoring.

He has been characterized as a \\"face for the melancholy\\", and the themes in his songs are often broken hearts, loneliness, and sorrow. Sometimes his lyrics include social criticism, but he also shows trivial and funny sides of himself.  Career  Eggum was born in Bergen, but started as a pub singer in London, and made his living for two years writing songs in English. One of his most famous songs ‚Äì \\"En natt forbi\\" (\\"A night is over\\") ‚Äì was originally written in English, with the title \\"Alone, Awake\\". He got a record contract in 1975 with the Norwegian record company CBS, and recorded his debut album \\"Trubadur\\" that autumn. His breakthrough came after his third release, the album \\"Heksedans\\" from 1977. This album gave him the Norwegian award Spellemannsprisen, and on this album has such classics as \\"Mor, jeg vil tilbake\\". Since this, Eggum has been one of Norway's most well known artists, both as a solo artist and with others. An example of the latter is his membership in Gitarkameratene with fellow guitarists Lillebj√∏rn Nilsen, √òystein Sunde and Halvdan Sivertsen. Eggum has been a minor political candidate for the Norwegian Green Party.

Pictures. This is the first of several Bugs Bunny cartoon titles that refers to Elmer Fudd's speech impediment, making the names of Robert Clampett, Sid Sutherland, and Carl Stalling as well as the roles of Story, Supervision, and Musical Direction intentionally misspelled in the credits to receive the perfect match for Elmer's speech impediment. In the cartoon, Elmer expects to find rest and relaxation at Jellostone National Park. He mistakenly sets camp in the neighborhood of Bugs' rabbit hole, and Bugs (and a neighboring bear) don't have much leisure in mind. It was the first Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, with a story by Dave Monahan and musical direction by Carl Stalling. Sid Sutherland is the only credited animator, although Virgil Ross, Rod Scribner, and Robert McKimson also animated the short. Mel Blanc provided the voices for Bugs and the bear, and Arthur Q. Bryan provided the voice for Elmer. Plot Elmer, driving his Ford Model T jalopy to a Conga beat, makes his way to Jellostone National Park (a pun on Yellowstone National Park) while looking forward to getting some rest. Elmer sets up his campsite by setting a camp fire, and hanging mirror on a tree and, beneath it, a wash basin on a table, hanging a hammock, and pitching his tent. The tent is positioned directly over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole (just as Elmer had arrived, Bugs had posted a sign next to his hole saying 'Camp Here', then had retreated into the lair, covering it with grass as he went). From down there, Bugs breaks down the tent and drags it inside. Elmer reaches in and, in spite of resistance from below, retrieves the tent which is tied in knots. Bugs pops up, welcomes Elmer to Jellostone (\\"a restful retreat. Oh brudda!\\") and pulls Elmer's hat over his eyes. Elmer reaches in again and tries to yank Bugs out. After several attempts, Elmer pulls his hands out to find that his fingers are tied together. He nails a board over the hole (\\"that'll hold 'em alwhight, heh-heh-heh-heh-heh\\"). However, Bugs simply pushes it open, steps out and mimics Elmer. Bugs balloons up to Elmer's size and repeats what Elmer had said, labeling it \\"phooey\\". Elmer then settles into his hammock and quickly falls fast asleep, muttering to himself. Bugs places a pair of glasses on Elmer's face, paints the lenses black and sets the alarm clock to go off at noon. When it wakes Elmer, he thinks it is nighttime because everything seems dark. He goes to his tent, takes off his day clothes to reveal night clothes underneath, and goes to bed. Bugs then removes the glasses from Elmer and crows like a rooster, awakening Elmer who believes it is the next morning. Elmer washes his face but cannot reach his towel because it is hanging on a branch that Bugs keeps at a steady, short distance from him. Elmer blindly follows the towel (\\"I do this kind of stuff to him all through the picture\\", Bugs confides to the audience). He causes Elmer to step off a cliff edge. Elmer looks at the miraculous view of the Grand Canyon, but suddenly realizes he is in midair. He runs back to safety and holds on to Bugs for dear life. Bugs then admits he is the one pulling these gags and runs off, with a furious Elmer giving chase after retrieving a gun from his tent. However, he runs into a black bear. The bear starts growling, and so Elmer turns to a wildlife handbook for advice, which directs him to play dead. The bear soon gives up (after sniffing Elmer's \\"B.O.\\" ‚Äì his feet), but Bugs climbs onto Elmer and starts growling exactly like the bear. He misbehaves in various ways to keep Elmer on the ground with his eyes shut, but just as he starts biting Elmer's foot, Elmer sees what is going on and grabs his shotgun. The bear returns and Bugs runs away just as Elmer swings the gun, clobbering the bear rather than the rabbit. A chase ensues with Elmer and the bear running through the trees to the tune of the \\"William Tell Overture.\\" Finally, the bear freaks Elmer out by riding on top of him. When the bear is knocked off him after hitting a tree branch, Elmer gives up and packs everything into his car (almost including a huge tree). He passes the welcome sign at the gate on his way out, backs up and reads it again. He declares he will make a promise of \\"a restful retreat\\" to be \\"bawoney!\\" and, to teach the park not to give false advertisement, he chops the sign to bits with an ax and stomps on the pieces while calling the park's \\"peace and wewaxation\\" promises \\"wubbish!\\" A ranger (along with Bugs) appears, and has an angry expression on his face. Elmer is arrested for the destruction of government property, and from his jail cell window he tells us that \\"anyway\\" he is \\"wid of that gwizzwy bear and scwewy wabbit! West and wewaxation at wast!\\" Unfortunately, he turns to find out that somehow he is sharing his cell with both Bugs and the black bear. They both ask how long he has in jail (\\"Pardon me but, how long ya in for, doc?\\" they ask). Production For the cartoon, Elmer was redesigned as a fat man (based on voice actor Arthur Q. Bryan's own physique) in an attempt to make him funnier. The \\"fat Elmer\\" would only make three more appearances in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies canon ‚Äì The Wabbit Who Came to Supper, The Wacky Wabbit and Fresh Hare, in addition to a cameo appearance in the war bond advertisement Any Bonds Today? ‚Äì before returning to the slimmer form by which he is better known, for The Hare-Brained Hypnotist. This cartoon was the only time, though, that the Fat Elmer also had a red nose. This is the only cartoon with the \\"fat\\" version of Elmer to remain under copyright; the other \\"fat Elmer\\" cartoons are in the public domain. Bugs would show up in a prison two more times: in Rebel Rabbit (1949) and Big House Bunny (1950). At the ends of Rabbit Transit (1947) and Hare Brush (1955) he is arrested, but not actually shown in prison therein, Bugs would also be arrested at the end of Fresh Hare (1942), but it is shown he decided to give himself up and also given a death penalty instead. The lobby card where Bugs paints Elmer's glasses black is also done in the film.

The meme originated from fictitious cover art for a video game titled Big Chungus (with \\"chungus\\" being a neologism associated with video game commentator Jim Sterling) which featured the still and was popularized by a Facebook post by a GameStop manager, who alleged that a colleague's mother had inquired about purchasing the fictional game as a gift for her son.

Additionally, the disorder prevents the body from making ketones, which are used for energy during fasting. Presentation This disorder usually appears within the first year of life. The signs and symptoms of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency include vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, convulsions, and coma. When episodes occur in an infant or child, blood sugar becomes extremely low (hypoglycemia), and harmful compounds can build up and cause the blood to become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). These episodes are often triggered by an infection, fasting, strenuous exercise, or sometimes other types of stress. Cause Mutations in the HMGCL gene cause 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. The enzyme made by the HMGCL gene plays an essential role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for processing leucine, an amino acid that is part of many proteins. This enzyme also produces ketones during the breakdown of fats. If a mutation in the HMGCL gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to process leucine or make ketones properly. A lack of ketones leads to hypoglycemia, and compounds called organic acids (which are formed as products of amino acid and fat breakdown) can cause the blood to become too acidic. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia impair tissue function, especially in the central nervous system. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= This condition is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that develops in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.

This enabled the aristocratic family to recover financially through the hefty bride price usually asked from the commoner. On the other hand, the commoner was allowed to add the aristocratic name of his bride (with the nobiliary particle \\"de\\") to his own family name, and this was dearly sought. This social practice was frowned upon by aristocratic families less in need, who looked with contempt or pity at the aristocratic families that had to re-gild their coat of arms. They called such an alliance with a commoner a m√©salliance (\\"misalliance, marriage beneath one's station\\"), and the practice was often called d√©choir (\\"to fall from rank\\") or salir son blason (\\"to dirty one's coat of arms\\"). As in most of Europe, noble children who married commoners would lose their noble status and take on that of their spouses. In the worst-case scenario, if the poor aristocratic family died out with no other heir than the daughter married to the commoner, the family was said to \\"fall into commonalty\\" (tomber en roture). As the French economy underwent drastic changes after the Middle Ages, many aristocratic families lost their position of power and wealth, and ended up in poverty. For those aristocratic families from the provinces and far from Paris, far away from power and its associated gratifications, redorer son blason was often the only way to remain afloat. This was usually a step taken in the last extremity, often seen as shameful and degrading. However, in a few cases, redorer son blason could also be prestigious, such as was the case for the aristocratic families who married daughters with members of the Colbert family. Modern usage Today in France, the phrase is still used, but in a different context, meaning \\"to regain prestige\\" or \\"to improve one's image\\". An example of this contemporary usage in French newspapers is the Le Point headline: \\"Les maires FN veulent redorer leur blason\\".

According to oral tradition, in about 1740, Galanga, a tribal leader from the Congo, was taken along with a large part of his tribe and sold as a slave. They were brought from Africa to Brazil in a slave ship and during this journey his authority amongst his compatriots was noticed by the Portuguese slave traders who nicknamed him \\"Chico Rei\\". In Brazil he was set to work in the gold mines of Minas Gerais. By hiding flakes of gold about his body and in his hair, he amassed sufficient funds to allow him, after 5 years or so, to buy his son's freedom and later his own. He was also able to acquire the Encardideira gold mine in Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto). Profits from the mine were used to help other slaves to buy their freedom and to build the church of Santa Efig√™nia, also in Vila Rica. The Encardideira mine has been disused since 1888 when slavery was abolished in Brazil and it is now open to the public. The legend of Chico Rei has become part of the Brazilian folklore and his admirable tale of fight for freedom has captured the imagination of many Brazilian storytellers. His story is often told in Brazilian folklore tales books, and it has been told both in theater and cinema as well.

In ancient and medieval times pectoral crosses were worn by both clergy and laity, but by the end of the Middle Ages the pectoral cross came to be a special indicator of position worn by bishops. In the Catholic Church, the wearing of a pectoral cross remains restricted to popes, cardinals, bishops and abbots. The modern pectoral cross is relatively large, and is different from the small crosses worn on necklaces by many Christians. Most pectoral crosses are made of precious metals (platinum, gold or silver) and some contain precious or semi-precious gems. Some contain a corpus like a crucifix while others use stylized designs and religious symbols. In many Christian denominations, the pectoral cross symbolizes that the person wearing it is a member of the clergy, or that the wearer is a member of the higher or senior clergy. However, in many Western churches there are an increasing number of laypeople who choose to wear some form of a cross around their neck. While many Christians, both clergy and laity, wear crosses, the pectoral cross is distinguished by both its size (up to six inches across) and that it is worn in the center of the chest below the heart (as opposed to just below the collarbones). Throughout the centuries, many pectoral crosses have been made in the form of reliquaries which contain alleged fragments of the True Cross or relics of saints. Some such reliquary pectorals are hinged so that they open to reveal the relic, or the relic may be visible from the front through glass. Historical use A pectoral cross worn by the 7th-century female teenager of the Trumpington bed burial One of the earliest mentions of a pectoral cross is its mention by Pope Hilarius in 461. In 811 Nicephorus sent Pope Leo III a golden pectoral cross. At this time, pectoral crosses were worn by both clergy and laity. The widespread official use of a pectoral cross, however, did not begin in the Western church until around the 14th century. The use of the pectoral cross in the Roman Rite was first required in the Roman Pontifical of Pius V. The first Anglican bishop to wear a pectoral cross was Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln (1885‚Äì1910). Roman Catholic practice Archbishop Paul B√πi VƒÉn ƒê·ªçc of Vietnam wearing Pope Francis' pectoral cross suspended by a chain while in cassock In the Roman Catholic Church, a pectoral cross is one of the pontificals used by the pope, cardinals, archbishops and bishops. Various popes have extended this privilege to abbots, abbesses and some cathedral canons. For Cardinals the use is regulated by Motu Proprio \\"Crux Pectoralis\\" of Pius X. A pectoral cross is worn with both clerical suits or religious habits, and when attending both liturgical or civil functions. With a clerical suit, the pectoral cross is worn either hung around the neck so it remains visible or is placed in the left shirt or coat pocket so the chain is still visible but the cross is not (this is not actually an official requirement, but is done for practical purposes). If a cassock is worn, the pectoral cross is either suspended from the prelate's neck and hangs free or is fastened to a front button with a special hook that is attached to the cross. The presence of a pectoral cross is useful to distinguish a bishop from a monsignor, since they wear similar cassocks. In choir dress‚Äîthat is, when he wears a cassock, rochet and mozzetta‚Äîthe pectoral cross is usually suspended by a cord of silk. This cord is green and gold for an archbishop or a bishop, and red and gold for a cardinal and gold for the pope. An abbot makes use of a black and gold silk cord while an abbess and canon would use a black silk cord. Formerly, protonotaries apostolic wore a pectoral cross on a purple silk cord when celebrating in pontificals. Cardinal Patabendige Don of Colombo wearing a pectoral cross suspended by a cord while in choir dress When celebrating Mass, bishops wear the pectoral cross suspended by the cord over the alb but under the chasuble, where it is not visible. However, some bishops wear their pectoral cross over their chasuble, suspended by a chain. If clerics who do not possess episcopal character wish to wear a pectoral cross, it is presumed that they are free to wear it under their clothes, so as not to confuse them with bishops. Again in practice some clergy who are not prelates do wear a pectoral cross. It is worn over the alb during liturgical functions. The prelate should kiss the cross before putting it on his neck, and while putting it on say the prayer Munire me digneris (the origin of which dates back to the Middle Ages), in which he petitions God for protection against his enemies, and begs to bear in mind continually the Passion of Jesus, and the triumphs of the confessors of the Faith. The pontifical pectoral cross is distinct from the simple cross, the use of which is often permitted by the pope to members of cathedral chapters. Canons, to whom this privilege has been granted, are permitted to wear the cross at choir service only, and not over the alb at liturgical services, unless specially permitted. The pectoral is the latest addition to episcopal ornaments. The custom, however, of wearing a cross on the breast either with or without holy relics, dates back to ancient time and was observed not only by bishops, but also by priests and lay people. The first mention made of the pectoral cross as a part of pontifical ornament is made by Innocent III, and its use as such only became customary toward the close of the Middle Ages. As an adornment for bishops we meet it the first time toward the end of the thirteenth century (Durandus), but at that time it was not generally worn by bishops. As Durandus says: \\"it was left to the discretion of the individual bishop to wear it or not\\". Anglican practice Soo Yee Po, Anglican bishop of the Diocese of Western Kowloon The widespread use of pectoral crosses has been revived in the Anglican Communion, and is usually limited to bishops. The pectorals worn by Anglican bishops do not normally have the corpus (body of Jesus) depicted on them. They may be decorated with amethyst\\"Amethysts and Bishops' Rings\\", by William V. Rauscher or a bishop's mitre, and are usually suspended from a simple gold chain. Anglo-Catholic bishops may follow more of the Roman Catholic model. Other Anglican clergy occasionally wear crosses around their necks, but their appearance and form are generally more modest so as not to confuse them with bishops (who also generally wear purple, palatinate, or amaranth magenta shirts). At their meeting in The Vatican on 21 November 2009 to resolve tensions over an offer for disaffected Anglicans to convert to Rome, the Pope gave the Archbishop of Canterbury a pectoral Cross. This was interpreted by some observershttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/6624661/Archbishop-of- Canterbury-tells-Pope-that-Catholic-row-left-him-feeling-awkward.html as an indication that the Pope recognized the Archbishop of Canterbury as a Bishop, in spite of Apostolicae curae a papal bull from 1897 under which the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the validity of Anglican ordination. Protestant practice In recent years, Protestant churches have returned to more traditional ceremonial dress from either the Catholic, Orthodox or Anglican tradition. Pectoral crosses are worn by clergy in many denominations, mainly Lutheranism, by a bishop, or by a pastor or occasionally by choristers or liturgical assistants in other denominations. Generally speaking, only prelates will wear a gold cross suspended with a chain when wearing ceremonial garments or when wearing a suit, in one's left pocket over the heart. Clergy who are not bishops usually wear a silver cross suspended by a cord (usually black). In some denominations the colour of the cord refers to a specific position held in that denomination. The bishop of Str√§ngn√§s Thure Annerstedt wearing a pectoral cross of the model used in the Church of Sweden. =Church of Sweden= In the Church of Sweden, pectoral crosses were reintroduced for bishops in 1805 by king Gustav IV Adolf. The model of 1805 is still in use today. Bishops wear a simple latin cross of gold suspended by a gold chain. The archbishop of Uppsala uses the same model with the addition of golden rays in the angles of the cross. Eastern Catholic and Orthodox practice Russian Orthodox Archimandrite Palladius (Kafarov), wearing gold pectoral cross with jewels (1888) Orthodox Silver pectoral cross In Orthodox practice, the pectoral cross is worn by all bishops, but not necessarily by all priests. In the Greek tradition, the pectoral cross is only given to specific priests for faithful service; in the Russian tradition, the silver cross is worn by all priests. Whenever the cross is put on, the wearer first uses it to make the Sign of the Cross on himself and then kisses it and puts it on. The priest's cross depicts the crucified Christ, whether in painted form as an icon, or in relief. However, the Orthodox crucifix differs from the Western type by the fact that the soma (body of Christ) is not in full three-dimensional form, but in no more than three-quarter relief. It also bears the inscription INBI (the titulus that Pontius Pilate placed above the head of Jesus at the crucifixion) and the letters IC XC NIKA around the four arms of the cross. Orthodox pectoral crosses are almost always on chains of either silver or gold, sometimes with intricately worked links. Priest's crosses will often have an icon of Christ \\"Made Without Hands\\" at the top. This is the icon before which Orthodox Christians usually confess their sins. In Russian practice, the back of a priest's cross is usually inscribed with St. Paul's words to St. Timothy: \\"Be an example to the believers in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity\\" (1 Tim. 4:12). Orthodox pectoral crosses are awarded in several degrees (particularly in the Russian tradition): *The Silver Cross is awarded to all priests by their bishop on the day of their ordination. This tradition began with the last Tsar, Nicholas II, who awarded a silver cross to every priest in the Russian Empire. Even after the fall of the Romanov Dynasty, the practice of awarding the Silver Cross to Russian priests at their ordination has continued to this day. This practice helps to distinguish priests from deacons or monks, all of whom wear the same type of riassa (cassock), and are otherwise indistinguishable when not vested. The Silver Cross is not enameled or decorated in any manner except for engraving or relief. Russian Orthodox priests do not wear the cross by right of their priesthood, but only by permission of their bishop. One way a bishop may punish one of his priests is to forbid him to wear the priest's cross. *The next-ranking award is the Gold Cross. This is a simple gold cross, similar to the Silver Cross, and similarly without enameling or other decoration. The Gold Cross is worn by archpriests, abbots and abbesses as a mark of their office, and may be awarded by the bishop to other priests, both married and monastic, for distinguished service to the church. *The highest pectoral cross, is With Decorations‚Äîthat is, jeweled, and sometimes enameled‚Äîand normally has a depiction of an Eastern- style mitre at the top. This type of pectoral is also referred to as a \\"Jeweled Cross\\". This type of cross is worn by bishops, archimandrites and protopresbyters as a sign of their office, and may be awarded to other priests as well. All bishops are entitled to wear the pectoral cross with decorations, although most simply wear a Panagia when not vested for services. When vesting before celebrating the Divine Liturgy, the pectoral cross is presented to the bishop who will bless the pectoral, cross himself with it, kiss the cross and put it on. Meanwhile, the Protodeacon, swinging the censer says the following prayer: > He who would be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross and > follow me (, etc.); always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen. A priest may be granted the right to wear a second pectoral cross. A priest who has been given the pectoral cross will typically wear it at all times, whether vested or not. In Russian practice, a nun who is not an abbess may also be granted the privilege of wearing a pectoral cross, as an honorary award (however, this award is not granted to monks who are not priests). Coptic Church The pectoral cross worn by Coptic bishops and abbots is sometimes made from intricately worked leather, though metal pectorals are also used.

She was originally SS Prinzess Irene, a built in 1899 by AG Vulcan Stettin of Stettin, Germany, for the North German Lloyd line. At the beginning of World War I the ship was in New York and was interned by the United States. She was seized when that country entered the conflict in 1917 and converted to a troop transport. As USS Pocohantas, she carried 24,573 servicemen to Europe, and after the war returned 23,296 servicemen to the United States. Decommissioned by the U.S. Navy, the United States Shipping Board sold her back to the North German Lloyd line, where she saw mercantile service until being scrapped in 1932.  SS Prinzess Irene She was launched as Prinzess Irene on 19 June 1900 by Aktiengesellschaft Vulkan, Stettin, Germany for North German Lloyd Lines. On 9 September 1900, she started her maiden voyage to New York City. On 30 October 1900, she began the first of seven trips on the German Empire mail run to the Far East to Yokohama, the route she was built for. On 30 April 1903, she went on the Genoa ‚Äì Naples ‚Äì New York run and stayed mainly on this service together with her sister ship and sometimes other ships of the Barbarossa class. In 1911 under, Captain Frederic von Letten-Peterssen, she was stranded for eighty-three hours on the Fire Island sandbars. Her last voyage was to New York on 9 July 1914. With the outbreak of World War I in August, she was stranded in New York since the British Royal Navy controlled the North Atlantic. She remained there until seized by the United States by on 30 June 1917, under the authority prescribed in the Enemy Vessel Confiscation Joint Resolution passed on 12 May 1917.  USS Pocahontas After refitting and training with the Atlantic Fleet, she was commissioned as Princess Irene on 25 July 1917, Commander Junius F. Hellweg in command. Assigned to the Cruiser-Transport Force under Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the ship was renamed Pocahontas on 1 September 1917. Through the rest of the war and for nearly a year after the Armistice, Pocahontas served as a troop transport, completing eighteen round trips to Europe. She carried 24,573 servicemen to Brest and St. Nazaire and returned 23,296 servicemen to the United States. Although Pocahontas conveyed all of her passengers safely, she faced numerous dangers. The most serious incident occurred in the forenoon of 2 May 1918 when an Imperial German Navy submarine surfaced in her path and straddled her with shells. Captain Edward C. Kalbfus ordered the crew to battle stations and gave the signal to open fire. However, the U-boat was not in range of her guns. Fragments of enemy shells landed on the ship, but she was not directly hit and suffered no casualties. Captain Kalbus commenced zig-zag courses, and then at full speed drew away from the submarine, probably , about twenty minutes after the attack began. Making a record of , he kept the enemy out of range until he lost her. For his successful defense of his ship, Captain Kalfbus was awarded the Navy Cross. Pocahontas decommissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 7 November 1919 and was handed over to the United States Shipping Board for sale.  SS Pocahontas In 1920, SS Pocahontas was chartered to the United States Mail Steamship Company of New York and began commercial services between the United States and Italy in 1921. =Events of 1921‚Äì1922= Pocahontas was the subject of widespread media coverage between May and July 1921 due to mechanical problems, sabotage and mutiny. The vessel left New York on 23 May 1921 en route to Naples. On 25 May, she was anchored off Nobska Point in Vineyard Sound in need of repair. A gang of boilermakers and mechanics boarded the ship to make repairs en route to Boston. Further repairs were undertaken in the Azores in June. The vessel did not arrive in Naples until 4 July, spending 43 days at sea. It was later reported that the vessel had been subject to sabotage and that some of the crew \\"began to threaten the commander and to damage the machinery and the electric light apparatus and even attempt ... to sink the steamer\\" Just before entering Naples, the assistant engineer drowned when he jumped overboard. On arrival in Naples, the ship's captain submitted a full report to the American consul, who conducted an investigation. The crew, in turn, filed charges of cruelty against the captain with the Italian authorities. While the crew were returned to the United States, the ship was repaired in Naples. A \\"great deal\\" of cotton waste was found in the steamer's pumps, but otherwise it suffered only minor damage. Although she was due to sail for New York on 31 July, the ship was ordered to stay in port pending payment of debts incurred in relation to the repair work. The total repair bill amounted to 2,700,000 lire. Despite intervention from the American consul, the ship did not sail until 8 September. Due to frequent bunker fires, however, the ship was considered to be in worse condition \\"than when it was in drydock\\". The vessel was again laid up on 22 September, this time in Gibraltar, having suffered further damage to her machinery. Passengers were transferred to other vessels. The ship then remained inactive until she was sold in 1922. The then future Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir, was on board Pocahontas in May 1921, while emigrating from the United States to Palestine. She recounts the events of the journey in her autobiography, My Life. =Sale to North German Lloyd= In April 1922, the United States Shipping Board received an offer of ¬£17,000 for the purchase of Pocahontas, which was then laid up in Malta. When the United States Mail Steamship Company went into liquidation in 1922, the ship was sold back to its original owners, North German Lloyd and renamed Bremen.  SS Bremen and SS Karlsruhe After repair and refit, SS Bremen made her first voyage from Bremen to New York in April 1923. The Laristan a cargo ship foundered in the Atlantic Ocean () with the loss of 24 of her 30 crew. Survivors were rescued by the .

He is the author of over 60 books and at the time of over 700 hymns, songs, Psalms (often in an own interpretation), and prayers.Digital Library for the Dutch literature Author page Huub Oosterhuis (Retrieved: September 21, 2006) Career Oosterhuis was born on 1 November 1933 in Amsterdam. He was a Jesuit and is a Roman Catholic priest. In 1954, inspired by Che Guevara who said that churches have the potential to transform the social structure of society,SP.nl Tribune Interview with Huub Oosterhuis, October 22, 2004. (Retrieved: September 21, 2006) Oosterhuis combined his priesthood with political activism. In 1965, Oosterhuis became one of the major supporters of ecumenism, following the modernist interpretation of the Second Vatican Council. He started out to rewrite the liturgy and make it acceptable to all. Some of his changes were considered controversial within the Roman Catholic Church especially writing the prayer for agnostics: \\"Heer, als U bestaat, kom dan onder ons\\" (\\"Lord, if You exist, come amongst us\\"). His political views, conflicts regarding the liturgy and unorthodox views regarding priestly celibacy led to Oosterhuis being dismissed from the Jesuit order in 1969. He left the Catholic Church and functioned as an Independent Catholic priest, in charge of a church in Amsterdam, for about forty years. He is still focussed on writing liturgy, poetry and essays. Back in the sixties and seventies his liturgical texts were put to music by his fellow former Jesuit (1922‚Äì2003). The co-operation between Oosterhuis and Huijbers ended. The last engaged himself more and more in a \\"spirituality-without-God\\" or \\"- without-Thou\\", whereas the former kept to his biblical prayers, hymns, psalms. After they both split up and Huijbers moved to the South of France, Oosterhuis' main composers were two of Huijbers' pupils, (born 1945) and Tom L√∂wenthal (born 1954). Oosterhuis founded the discussion center \\"\\" (\\"The Red Hat\\") in Amsterdam in 1989. The building was a former Remonstrant shelter church, hidden because Remonstrantism was outlawed in the 17th century. The building was more or less deserted at the time. Oosterhuis wanted to use it for his student organization (1990) and create a discussion center. Its nice interior made it also very suitable for TV-shows. After a short period Oosterhuis was replaced by a managing-director for a more commercial exploitation of this prominent building in Amsterdam's Canal zone. Prince Claus In 2002 Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands asked him to deliver the eulogy at the funeral of her Prince-Consort Claus von Amsberg, a longtime personal friend, in the New Church in Delft. That same week the Protestant VU University in Amsterdam granted Oosterhuis an honorary doctorate in theology. It was at De Rode Hoed where Andr√© van der Louw announced his Social Democratic Renewal Program which was an incentive to reform the Labour Party.

Variables x, y and z are drawn from normal distributions with means 10, 10, and 30, respectively, and standard deviations 1, 1, and 3 respectively, i.e., : \\\\begin{align} x,y & \\\\sim N(10,1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ z & \\\\sim N(30,3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Even though x, y, and z are statistically independent and therefore uncorrelated, in the depicted typical sample the ratios x/z and y/z have a correlation of 0.53. This is because of the common divisor (z) and can be better understood if we colour the points in the scatter plot by the z-value. Trios of (x, y, z) with relatively large z values tend to appear in the bottom left of the plot; trios with relatively small z values tend to appear in the top right. Approximate amount of spurious correlation Pearson derived an approximation of the correlation that would be observed between two indices (x_1/x_3 and x_2/x_4), i.e., ratios of the absolute measurements x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4: : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{r_{12} v_1 v_2 - r_{14} v_1 v_4 - r_{23} v_2 v_3 + r_{34} v_3 v_4}{\\\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_3^2 - 2 r_{13} v_1 v_3} \\\\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_4^2 - 2 r_{24} v_2 v_4}} where v_i is the coefficient of variation of x_i, and r_{ij} the Pearson correlation between x_i and x_j. This expression can be simplified for situations where there is a common divisor by setting x_3=x_4, and x_1, x_2, x_3 are uncorrelated, giving the spurious correlation: : \\\\rho_0 = \\\\frac{v_3^2}{\\\\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_3^2} \\\\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_3^2}}. For the special case in which all coefficients of variation are equal (as is the case in the illustrations at right), \\\\rho_0 = 0.5 Relevance to biology and other sciences Pearson was joined by Sir Francis Galton and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon in cautioning scientists to be wary of spurious correlation, especially in biology where it is common to scale or normalize measurements by dividing them by a particular variable or total. The danger he saw was that conclusions would be drawn from correlations that are artifacts of the analysis method, rather than actual ‚Äúorganic‚Äù relationships. However, it would appear that spurious correlation (and its potential to mislead) is not yet widely understood. In 1986 John Aitchison, who pioneered the log-ratio approach to compositional data analysis wrote: More recent publications suggest that this lack of awareness prevails, at least in molecular bioscience.

About Westtown School Founded in 1799 by the Religious Society of Friends, Westtown's campus is located in Chester County, PA, 25 miles west of Philadelphia. In 1799, Westtown was around one day's carriage ride from Philadelphia. Westtown is a Quaker school affiliated with the Friends General Conference branch of the Religious Society of Friends. All students are required to attend Meeting for Worship together with adults in the community who voluntarily attend (boarding students are required to attend Westtown Monthly Meeting on Sundays as well). Westtown uses the traditional Quaker practice of coming to unity in making some high-level decisions. Westtown has been a coeducational school since its founding in 1799. Students come from many states and foreign countries. The 2018 documentary, We Town, is about the 2016-2017 Upper School Basketball Team, featuring Mo Bamba. It chronicles the quest of the team to win the State Championship. Currently, students at Westtown come from 20 states and 20 countries. History Westtown School first opened on May 6, 1799. It was founded by Philadelphia Quakers who raised the money to build a boarding school and purchased land a full day's carriage ride from Philadelphia‚Äîwhere they could provide a ‚Äúguarded education in a healthy environment\\" away from the secular influences of the city. For many years, Westtown was nearly self- sufficient, with the campus providing raw materials used in the construction of its buildings and food for the people who lived and worked at the school. Boys and girls had separate classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful skills such as woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and girls had classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, penmanship, grammar, mathematics, geography, and science. The 1880s brought physical changes to Westtown. The main building was replaced with a structure designed by architect Addison Hutton, which was completed in 1888 and is still in use today. During the 20th century, the student body and the curriculum both became more diverse. Visual and performing arts were added, for example, and non-Quakers, African-American, and international students were eventually admitted. Westtown's Esther Duke Archives is a facility dedicated to collecting and maintaining materials relating to the people and history of the school. Students and historians alike use the Archives for historical research. Westtown's Campus Westtown is located on a campus in southern Pennsylvania. The campus is 600 acres, including a 14.5-acre lake, arboretum, frog pond, 14 playing fields, stadium tennis courts, organic farm, Lower School mini-farm, medicine wheel garden, wooded cross country course, and 21-element ropes course.

The population of the community at the 2011 census was 267. The community occupies the area west of the Ewenny River, between Bridgend and Porthcawl. It takes in the settlement of Tythegston and a stretch of coastal sand dunes known as Merthyr Mawr Warren. It is in the historic county of Glamorgan.  Buildings and landmarks of note  Merthyr Mawr House is an early 19th-century mansion built by Sir John Nicholl and set in an extensive park. Within the park is the Iron Age hillfort known as Chapel Hill Camp, and within the embankments is the now roofless 15th century chapel of St Roque (or Roch), which houses two early medieval inscribed stones.Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Landscapes: Merthyr Mawr accessed 11 May 2013 Merthyr Mawr is largely an estate village for the House. It now contains several cottages retaining thatched roofs and well maintained gardens. At the south end of the village is the parish church of St Teilo, which was built in 1849-51 to a design by Benjamin Ferrey and John Pritchard, on an ancient medieval site. A collection of stones from the former churchyard and the surrounding area are displayed in a shelter in the churchyard. Nearby are the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes. Candleston Castle is on the edge of the area of dunes. Mike Young Productions children's cartoon studio is located in Merthyr Mawr. The River Ogmore flows through the village and a famous sheep dipping bridge crosses it on the outskirts of the village. The former POW Camp Island Farm is less than a mile away. The Ewenny River forms the southern boundary of both the community and the borough. The villages of Ewenny and Ogmore-by-Sea are both on the southern bank of the Ewenny, along with Ogmore Castle.

Since its founding in 1937, Vendo has come out with many innovations that now exist in nearly every beverage and snack vending machine in use today. In 2005, Vendo moved its headquarters to Dallas, Texas, and was renamed SandenVendo America, Inc., signifying a new global synergy with parent and sister companies in Japan, North America, and Europe.  History  Vendo was founded in 1937 in Kansas City, Missouri, by brothers Elmer F. and John T Pierson. With help from J.E. Hagstrom and purchased patent for a lid that could be attached to coolers, the brothers developed an innovative vending lid that was much more practical than any other one available at the time. Nicknamed \\"Red Top\\", this vending lid moved the opening to the bottle rather than the bottle to the opening and was the first of many innovations introduced by the Vendo company. After the outbreak of World War II, some of the company's work force was dedicated to producing radar detection systems as well as various other electronic equipment for the military. As well as manufacturing military equipment, Vendo was authorized to produce and send 5,000 beverage vending units for military training camps and war plants to help raise morale. For its efforts, company earned seven Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Awards awards for \\"excellence in fulfilling government military contracts\\". The 1948 Coca-Cola \\"Vendo Decapper\\" used 17 steps to dispense bottle, remove cap and pour into cup, eliminating the need for customers to dispose of bottles. After the war, the Vendo company began expanding globally. By 1956, vending machines were being shipped internationally to 20 different countries. At the same time, Vendo began experimenting with new ideas. Vending machines that dispensed varieties of goods were manufactured and distributed and existing beverage vending machines were given a new, sleeker look. It was this time that the company began creating completely automated convenience stores and restaurants as well as drive-in refreshment stations. In 1956, Vendo merged with its primary rival, Vendorlator. It became a major supplier for the entire soft-drink industry and, for a brief period, the company went public. The company's expansion continued into the 1970s as the company expanded its international market and began manufacturing the world's first canned beverage dispensing machine. The oil crisis of the 1970s struck a major blow to Vendo Co. Facing major financial losses, the company sold off all of its assets, keeping only its beverage machine distribution division. The site in Kansas City was abandoned and the company kept only the plants in Fresno, California and Corinth, Mississippi. The company was revitalized in the 1980s when it was acquired by Sanden Corporation, a manufacturer of high-tech electronics. The company received both technological and financial support from its new parent company and once again began introducing innovations to the automated goods distribution market. By the end of the 1990s, Vendo had received patents on many new features for vending machines, such as increased capacity, accommodation for goods of many different shapes and sizes, and the ability to accept debit cards as a form of payment. The company began to expand again into the 2000s, moving its headquarters to Dallas, Texas and taking on the name \\"Sanden Vendo\\" to show its thanks and loyalty to the Sanden Corporation. Along with Dixie-Narco, a rival company, Vendo is one of the main providers of vending machines for PepsiCo, particularly in the western United States. Vendo is also a major provider of vending machines for the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and a secondary provider for The Coca-Cola Company. Products Although Vendo makes most of its profit from selling vending machines and vending machine parts, the company also sells display stands for both refrigerated and hot food as well as innovative vending machine parts, such as versatile delivery systems and payment systems that will accept credit cards or dispense bills. =Vending Machines= * Snack Vendors * Beverage Vendors =Food Displays= * Hot food display stands * Refrigerated display stands =Vending Machine Parts= * Refrigeration systems * Coin mechanisms * Cash-handling systems * Parts for any vending machine made in the last ten years References External links * Vendo Company Web Page * Vendo Europe Main Page * Antique Cola Machine Archive Category:Retail companies of the United States Category:Vending machine manufacturers Category:Companies based in Kansas City, Missouri Category:Companies based in Dallas ","title":"Vendo"},{"id":"1972127","text":"Mitt may refer to: *Glove, a garment covering the whole hand *Baseball mitt, a large leather glove that is worn by baseball players on defense *Mitt (name), a surname and given name *Military transition team or MiTT *Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology or MITT *William Mitten (1819‚Äì1906), English chemist, whose name is usually abbreviated \\"Mitt.\\" *Mitt (film), a 2014 documentary film about Mitt Romney  Mitt Romney, the businessman and politician on whom the documentary was based See also *Mitts, a surname ","title":"Mitt"},{"id":"1972139","text":"A sideman is a professional musician who is hired to perform live with a solo artist, or with a group in which they are not a regular band member.Hinton, Kerry. Cool Careers Without College for Music Lovers. The Rosen Publishing Group, 2002. p. 57 The term is usually used to describe musicians that play with jazz or rock artists, whether solo or a group. Sidemen and sidewomen are often well-versed in multiple styles of music, and can be hired at any level of the music industry, from playing in a cover band to backing up established artists on major tours. While many artists can work as sidemen or session musicians, others will only fill one role. The generally accepted difference is that a sideman performs live while a session musician is hired to perform in a recording studio. Career progression Often aspiring musicians start out as sidemen, playing rhythm guitar, comping on keyboards, or playing drum kit in the rhythm section or singing backing vocals for a well-known bandleader or singer. Once sidemen have become experienced with live performance and recording with established artists, some move on to develop their own sound, a recognized name, and fans of their own, or go on to form their own groups, at which point they become bandleaders and recruit their own sidemen and sidewomen. Some examples of this are: * James Burton and Glen D. Hardin, playing guitar and keyboards respectively, who performed in the backing band for Elvis Presley, also backed Gram Parsons before joining newcomer Rodney Crowell and veteran Albert Lee in Emmylou Harris' \\"Hot Band\\". * Don Henley and Glenn Frey were in the initial backup band for Linda Ronstadt, which toured in support of her eponymous debut album. Afterwards, with the addition of Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner, they formed the Eagles. Lindley (1980) playing the pedal steel guitar Some sidemen become famous for their musical specialties, and become highly sought-after by pop, rock, blues, jazz and country music bands. Examples of some of these include multi- instrumentalists. David Lindley is a multi-instrumentalist who has worked with such diverse musicians as Curtis Mayfield, Dolly Parton, Jackson Browne, and Hani Naser. Lindley used his time as a sideman to discover and master new instruments while on tour around the world, becoming proficient on ethnic instruments rarely seen in Western music genres. He has mastered so many that he admits to losing count, and instead placed a photo gallery of them on his website. Waddy Wachtel's guitar licks and experience have placed him as a bandleader while on tour with Stevie Nicks, and Chuck Leavell, who has toured with The Allman Brothers Band, but more often, is onstage with The Rolling Stones on keyboards.Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/chuck- leavell-talks-stones-tour/ Relix Often sidemen go on to form their own groups and/or solo careers; for instance, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best acted as sidemen to Tony Sheridan before becoming famous as The Beatles, with the addition of Ringo Starr.

Mexican General Jos√© Urrea and 1,500 Centralista soldiers fought against Amon B. King and his 28 American volunteers and Lieutenant Colonel William Ward and his approximately 120 Americans. The battle, a part of the Goliad Campaign of the Texas Revolution, resulted in a Mexican victory and splintered Texan resistance. Background Under President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, the Mexican government began to shift away from a federalist model to a more centralized government. His increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the Constitution of 1824 in early 1835, incited federalists throughout the nation to revolt.Davis (2006), p. 121. The Mexican army quickly put down revolts in the Mexican interior, including a brutal suppression of militias in Oaxaca and Zacatecas.Davis (2006), p. 121.Hardin (1994), p. 7. Unrest continued in the Mexican state Coahuila y Tejas. The area that bordered the United States, known as Texas, was populated primarily by English-speaking settlers, known as Texians. In October, the Texians took up arms in what became known as the Texas Revolution.Davis (2006), p. 142. The following month, Texians declared themselves part of a state independent from Coahuila and created a provisional state government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824.Davis (2006), p. 168. By the end of the year, all Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas.Davis (2006), p. 183. Determined to quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force to restore order; by the end of 1835 his army numbered 6,019 soldiers.Hardin (1994), p. 102. In late December, at his behest, the Mexican Congress passed the Tornel Decree, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops \\"will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag\\". In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians.Scott (2000), p. 71. Santa Anna personally led the bulk of his troops inland to San Antonio de B√©xar and ordered General Jos√© de Urrea to lead 550 troops [additional units would follow] along the Atascocita Road toward Goliad. Urrea's mission objectives were twofold, first, protect the Mexican Army's southern flank. Secondly, clear the Texas Gulf Coast and occupy the various ports. This operation would intercept and stop the ongoing flow of men and supplies, isolating the Texas rebellion. Although Urrea eventually achieved his objectives, delays and high casualties prevented the General and his men from giving General Santa Anna's main force important support. This operation and successful suppression of the rebellion along the Texas Gulf Coast have become known as the Goliad Campaign.Hardin (1994), pp. 120-1. Prelude Colonel James Fannin and his men had improved the fortifications at the old Presidio La Bah√≠a and renamed it \\"Fort Defiance.\\" News of the fate of Texians under Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio and James Grant at the Battle of Agua Dulce (both captured in earlier fights) created confusion rather than stirring the volunteers gathered at Goliad into action. On March 7, Lewis Ayers brought Fannin news from Refugio, a town south of Goliad. The week before, the Victoriana Guardes, a group of Tejano (native Mexican residents) who supported centralism, had ransacked the town. After destroying much property, the Guardes, a militia under the command of Captain Carlos de la Garza, made camp just outside the town. Several pro-independence Anglo families, including Ayers' wife and children, remained in Refugio area, afraid that if they stayed they would be captured by the Mexican army, but that if they left they would be harmed by de la Garza's men.Scott (2000), p. 131. Fannin agreed to send troops to evacuate the settlers as soon as oxen and carts were available to assist with the transport. Three days later, the army's carts returned from Port Lavaca with supplies for the garrison.Stuart (2008), p. 89. As soon as they were unloaded, Fannin called for volunteers to go to Refugio. On March 11, Captain Amon B. King led 28 men of his company and most of the carts to evacuate the settlers.Hardin (1994), p. 164. They arrived that evening and camped for the night at Mission Nuestra Senora del Refugio, where some of the Anglo families had taken refuge.Stuart (2008), p. 92. The Mexican Catholic Church had abandoned the mission some years earlier. The mission was a semi ruin. No priests or other church officials were stationed at the old mission. Irish immigrant settlers from the Refugio area had recently repaired the main building's roof, doors and widows. They repaired pews and other interior furnishings and furniture. Although these repairs were crude and very basic, it made it possible to hold services when a priest could be found. The following morning, King led his troops to the ranch of Esteban Lopez, where the family of Lewis Ayers was staying. King arrested six Tejanos he had heard were ransacking abandoned homes. After he learned that other Tejanos were plundering homes about south, King took half of his men on an unauthorized mission to pursue them. They rode into an ambush staged by a group of de la Garza's men and Karankawa Indians. The Texians extricated themselves from the fight and returned to the Lopez ranch. All of the families gathered there were then escorted to the mission in Refugio. Elements of Urrea's advance cavalry arrived in Refugio shortly after King and the families returned to the mission. Mexican troops and de la Garza's Guardes (approx. 100 total troops) surrounded the mission. King sent a messenger to Fannin, asking for reinforcements. Earlier that day, Fannin had received notice that Mexican troops had taken the Alamo, killing all of the defenders.Stuart (2008), p. 94. Battle Fannin dispatched Lt. Colonel William Ward, a fellow Georgian, an organizer and former commander of the Georgia Battalion. This unit and a company commanded by Captain Peyton S. Wyatt, attached to the Georgia Battalion, would make up the balance of the relief column. The men departed in the early morning hours of the 13th of March. Fannin had decided to evacuate his position as soon as King and Ward returned. He ordered Ward to make all haste; avoid offensive contact with the Mexicans, to gather the civilians and return as soon as possible. To facilitate rapid movement, the Georgia Battalion carried only 36 rounds of ammunition per man as extended fighting was not expected. The column arrived in the early afternoon of the same day after a forced march over muddy roads. Ward found the mission under attack by some Mexican Cavalry and local Mexican militia. These forces retired after the Georgia Battalion fired one or two volleys. Although successful in breaking up the siege on the 13th, the arrival of Ward at Refugio led to conflict over command with Captain King who insisted, as first commander on scene, he should be in charge of the combined force, even though Lt. Colonel Ward was his regimental executive officer and outranked him. Ward insisted, after a short rest, the Georgia Battalion, King's Company should gather up the civilians and evacuate the Refugio Mission, returning to Goliad. King refused and stated he was taking his men to attack a ranch believed to be providing support for Captain Carlos de la Garza and the Mexican militias forces. The tense confrontation resulted in a stand off. King departed with his men and a few of the members of the Georgia Battalion (primarily from Wyatt's Company). The possibility of plunder and revenge was just too powerful for some. King and his men departed the mission in the early morning hours of the 14th. The failure of King to accept the orders directly from Fannin would have great ramifications for Fannin's entire command. 8. After King departed, more of Urrea's troops continued arriving and slowly, again, fully invested the mission. Sometime, late on the 13th or early morning hours of the 14th, a party of men under Captain Wyatt left the mission on patrol. They found a small group of Mexicans, probably militia, asleep and attacked, driving them away and killing 20-25 of the enemy. Early on the morning of the 14th, after King had departed, the Georgians heard firing in the distance. Thinking King may need assistance, Ward ordered two companies of the Georgia Battalion to form ranks and slowly move forward. The formation of 50-60 men halted after only 100 to 200 yards. To their front, the Georgians found a large formation of regular Mexican Army and were forced to return to the mission. Soon after, a water party from the mission came under fire but was successful bringing a large quantity of water back to the mission. As the Mexican Army maneuvered around the mission, Ward's men, under sporadic fire, attempted to further fortify the Refugio Mission complex. Ward assigned his 2nd company (Bullock's Company, (Captain U. J Bullock was absent. suffering from a case of measles, he had been left on the Texas coast and was never reunited with his company)), First Sergent Francis Marion Hunt of Macon Georgia commanding, to a low rock wall, part of an animal corral, to the east of the Mission building. This was necessary to cover the approach to the mission as the low wall blocked the view of the approaches to the mission. The rest of Georgia Battalion manned windows and dug some loopholes in the church's walls. For the most part, due to their ammunition shortage, the men did not return the Mexican fire. Before King advanced far, he found a far stronger Mexican military presence in the area and was forced to halt and find concealment in a wooded area approximately 2 miles from the mission. Before long, Mexican local militia under the command of Carlos de la Garza discovered the small Texian force and firing broke out. Sometime later, King's command heard gun fire in the direction of the mission. The Mexican militia force, had been content to engage the Texian force at some distance and the fire had been ineffective. King and his force began to move in the direction of the mission using cover and partial concealment of the terrain trees. But again, the company was forced to halt as units of the regular Mexican Army joined the attack. King's force, behind trees and rocks, made an effective defense for a time, causing severe loses to the enemy finally running out of ammunition. Mexican accounts state a wounded King and his men surrendered to Garza's militia. They were turned over to regular Mexican forces and executed near the Refugio mission on the 15th or early on 16 March 1836.Todish (1998), p. 129. King's men were left where they fell. Back at Refugio Mission on the morning of the 14th. Mexican Army units continued to arrive adding their musket fire to attack on the mission. This fire was largely ineffective at first. The Mexican Army had few rifles, the troops were issued smooth bore muskets. Their gunpowder was not of first quality and the troops received almost no marksmanship training. The shooting continued for at least another hour as the Mexicans slowly maneuvered closer to the mission. Due to the shortage of ammunition, Ward ordered his command to hold their fire until the enemy came closer. Soon, a small cannon joined in but the thick stone walls of the mission could not be penetrated. When Mexican troops began to mass in the open 200 to 300 yards distant, the Georgians opened fire with their rifles with great effect and continued to take a toll as Urrea's troops advanced both on foot and mounted. The attack was well coordinated with multiple regimental and battalion sized units attacking different points of the mission's perimeter. In some places, Mexican formations reached the low stone perimeter wall that surrounded the Mission. But none reached the church or crossed the far wall defended by Bullock's Company. The Georgia Battalion turned back 3, possibly 4, major attacks. At least 2 were focused at the low stone wall to the east of the mission. Samuel Hardaway, a 15 year old native of Macon Georgia native, and L. T. Pease, also from Macon Georgia, were members of Bullock's Company and two of the few who survived battle and the war. Both published narratives concerning their service. Pease states in his narrative he and the rest of Bullock's Company were stationed on the low stone wall east of the mission. Both he and Samuel Hardaway describe heavy fighting with the ranks of the enemy coming very near to the wall before melting away from the Georgian's fire. The ground was littered with many of the dead and dying. Witnesses report only three members of the Georgia Battalion were wounded. One soldier's wound appeared mortal. Another was shot in the leg and could not walk. Lastly, Colonel Ward had been struck by falling masonry dislodged by cannon fire. Estimates of Mexican casualties vary from 150 to 600 wounded and killed. General Jos√© de Urrea, the commander of this wing of the Mexican Army, reports seemed to change over the years following the war. His first reporting claimed around 200 killed and wounded. Those present on the Texas side also vary. From a low of 150 to as high as 600 are reported. Unit rosters of Urrea's force before March 12 and after March 17 show a decline of over 300 fit for duty on the 17th. Mexican casualty reports do not include loses for Mexican militia units who fought this day. These units were in skirmishes and or full-scale battles from the 12th to the 20th of March. Sadly the loses of the very courageous men are unknown. Ward sent courier James Humphries and least one other to Fannin for orders as the fighting slowed on the evening of the 14th. Late on the 14th, Edward Perry, a Texas prisoner of the Mexican Army, was sent by General Urrea with a surrender demand. He told Ward both his couriers and one sent by Fannin had been intercepted by Urrea. He also forwarded a letter from Fannin, captured from Fannin's messenger. This letter ordered Ward to fall back to Victoria, where Texas forces were to regroup.Todish (1998), p. 129. During that long day of the 14th, Mexican units continued to arrive. By evening Urrea had concentrated a force estimated to number 1200 soldiers, infantry and cavalry, 100-200 Mexican Mounted Militia and several pieces of artillery were deployed. General Urrea made no secret of his numbers, hoping to force a surrender by intimidation. The Georgian had a front row seat to the pageantry of the bands and deploying units. In spite of the ever-increasing strength of his foe and aware the Georgia Battalion could expect no help, Ward sent Mr. Perry back to Urrea with his answer. \\"The Georgians would not surrender.\\" With his supply of bullets and powder almost exhausted, Ward made plans to comply with Fannin's orders. That night or in the early morning hours of the 15th of March, in a driving rain storm, the Georgia Battalion, carrying their rifles, a very few rounds of ammunition and little else, quietly made their way through Mexican lines without notice of Mexican sentries. The wounded and at least one other healthy member of the unit, civilians and approximately 25 Mexican prisoners (unharmed) would remain behind.Todish (1998), p. 129. Ward and the bulk of his men escaped toward Copano, then turned at Melon Creek and headed for Victoria. At Refugio Mission, Mexican forces were not aware of their foes escape until daylight when the former Mexican prisoners left the mission. The wounded and Anglo civilians braced for the arrival of the Mexican Army. While those remaining in the mission were searched and systematically robbed of any valuables, Mexican officers soon arrived on scene and restored order. The wounded were protected (for a time) from ill treatments by common soldiers and women and children were made safe. Later, some of the common soldiers returned and executed the wounded. It is not known if they were acting under orders. Some historians believe the good treatment of the former Mexican prisoners helped to assuage, at least in part, the Mexican Army's desire for retribution. Juan Jos√© Holzinger, a German-Mexican officer, saw fit to save Lewis T. Ayers, Francis Dieterich, Benjamin Odlum and eight men from local families. The families who feared injury or death by Mexican forces were allowed to return to their homes unharmed. Events proved the rescue attempts by King's company and the Georgia Battalion unnecessary.Harbert Davenport and Craig H.

Published by the Texas State Historical Association. To avoid Mexican cavalry, Ward and his men were forced to travel in among the trees and heavy undergrowth along the creeks and many swamps. They waded in hip deep water for hours each day. Rain was frequent and the nights cold in these days of late March. Soldiers were forced to rest and sleep in trees. The command continued for days eating frogs, snakes whatever they could find. They did find and shoot a cow and rested for a time but were forced to return to the swamps upon the approach of Mexican forces. Although unfamiliar with the terrain, they struggled toward Victoria where it was thought Fannin should be. Survivors reported hearing gunfire in the direction of Coleto Creek two days before they neared Victoria. Men began to straggle and became lost or simply not wake up until the Battalion had moved on. Some of these men would prove to be the lucky ones but many of the lost were found be Mexican forces who rarely took prisoners. At Victoria, they found no time for rest; it was overrun with Urrea's troops. The group was forced to scatter after a short skirmish with Urrea's cavalry. Staying off the main roads, they moved toward Lavaca Bay, with ten of them eventually escaping. The remainder were surrounded and captured on March 22 by Urrea, two miles from Dimmit's Landing.Davis (2006), p. 236. Informed of Fannin's surrender, Ward and the men of the Georgia Battalion were promised surrender on the same terms given to Fannin's command at Coleto Creek. They were marched back to Victoria, where Holzinger again saved twenty-six men, by conscripting them as laborers for Urrea. Urrea had left Colonel Telesforo Alavez, in charge of Victoria. Se√±ora Francita Alavez intervened with her husband as well, to make sure the captive laborers' lives would be saved. The remainder were sent to Goliad by March 25, joining a wounded Fannin and the rest of the Goliad garrison. Two days latter, the men were told they would march to the Texas coast and freedom, instead, they were marched a mile away from their former fortress and shot under direct orders of General Santa Anna.Craig H. Roell, \\"REFUGIO, BATTLE OF,\\" Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qer01), accessed March 30, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Overview and outcome King and, later Ward, failed their attempt to evacuate the Anglo civilians at Refugio. Their ultimate fate was virtually guaranteed by Kings willful disobedience of his superior officer's orders (and Fannin's clear instructions). Colonel Fannin's waiting for the return of a significant portion of his command also allowed General Urrea to overtake the rest of the Texas forces under his command on the road to Victoria at Coleto Creek. It is very possible General Urrea could still have caught and defeated a united and stronger force if King and Ward had escaped Refugio and reunited with Fannin. A larger force would probably further increase Mexican's losses but likely would not changed the ultimate outcome. Fannin had received orders from General Sam Houston while King and Ward were away that directed him to evacuate Goliad and retire to Victoria as soon as possible. A timely withdrawal and ultimately, reinforcement with substantial numbers of troops would allow Fannin to remain on the field as an effective fighting force. Reluctant to leave before the various detachments returned, Fannin failed to leave Goliad ahead of Urrea's advance, leading to the Battle of Coleto. Fannin, in his short period of command had demonstrated a slowness and lack of basic organizational skills necessary to move a large military force any distance. But the failure of these this Texan force to move was not entirely his fault. The revolutionary government had failed completely to provide the transport and basic supplies necessary to transform a static garrison trained and equipped only for defense in place. Even if not delayed, Fannin's attempt to join with Houston was not a certainty. The sacrifice of the Texas volunteers at Refugio and Coleto Creek did result in severe damage to General Urrea's command and greatly delayed his advance, preventing his force from supporting the main army at San Jacinto. Additionally, Lt. Colonel Ward's successful breakout and withdrawal from the Refugio Mission during the night of 14‚Äì15 March 1836 and the 7 day retreat across rivers and through numerous swamps and bayous should be recognized as a notable military achievement. Ward, his officers and non commissioned officers were able to preserve unit integrity for the most part. Poorly equipped and clothed, lacking adequate food, the men of the Georgia Battalion continued to act in concert as a military unit and fighting force for the Texas cause. General Urrea was forced to deploy hundreds of his men to find and destroy the Georgians. Ward and the Georgia Battalion were able to fight off and successfully break contact with at least two Mexican Cavalry units and continue their march towards Victoria. Colonel Ward complied with Fannin's orders to reach Victoria. A feat Fannin, with a much larger force and a shorter distance to travel, could not do. When Ward found Victoria in the hands of the enemy, he continued on in an effort to reach a safe haven for his men and came within two miles of Dimmit's Landing before being overtaken and again surrounded by a force of regular Mexican Army troops. Surviving witnesses state the Georgia Battalion, using the very last of their ammunition, bayonets and their rifles as clubs fought off one last attack. General Urrea only then offered surrender terms, the same terms that vaguely offered a chance of parole and repatriation to the United States accepted by Fannin a few days earlier. Ward felt his men could again reach the timber and swamps and continue their march and told his officers he was against surrender. But the Georgia Battalion was a volunteer unit and he let his officers and men decide. Hungry, tired and suffering from exposure, the men voted to accept the Mexican General's terms. Through Ward's leadership, the Georgia Battalion continued as an effective fighting force for one very valuable week against an enemy force that was 12 times their number. Seven more days for Houston and his Army. Legacy In the public square across the street from the county courthouse in Refugio, the King Monument stands as an honor to Captain King and his men. In the early 1900s, the square was owned by the State of Texas and was named King's State Park.Texas; a Guide to the Lone Star State. New York: Hastings House, 1940. 436. Print. In the 1850s the Texas Governor and Legislature agreed, in exchange for the sacrifice of the young Georgians and to repay Georgia for weapons and military supplies provided to Texas, and to Georgia's request a monument be erected to honor the Georgia Battalion, the state would pay for a monument to be erected in Texas. For a time, Texas plead poverty. Then a war and reconstruction and Texas again delayed the promised monument. Georgia still waits, but, to this day, Texas has not satisfied this debt of honor. There is no marker or state monument in Texas dedicated to the memory of those boys from Georgia and other members of the Georgia Battalion.

It was founded in 1856. History Berks County's oldest institute of higher learning, Albright College traces its founding to 1856 when Union Seminary opened. Present-day Albright was formed by the mergers of several institutions. Albright Collegiate Institute opened in 1895 and was renamed Albright College three years later. Union Seminary became Central Pennsylvania College and, in 1902, merged with Albright College. Schuylkill College, previously called Schuylkill Seminary, merged with Albright College in 1928. Albright's campus relocated from Myerstown, to Schuylkill College's campus, which is the present location of Albright, at the base of Mount Penn in Reading. The College is named for Pennsylvania-German evangelical preacher Jacob Albright, who founded the Evangelical Association (later known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church). Born in 1759 in Douglass Township, (now Montgomery County) with the given name of Johannes Jacob Albrecht, the family changed their surname to \\"Albright\\" following Jacob's 1808 death. Academics Albright College offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, as well as a Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees in education. The college also offers accelerated degree programs with 10 locations throughout Pennsylvania. Albright offers liberal arts and pre-professional programs. It created one of the first undergraduate psychobiology programs in the nation in the 1960s. The college's liberal arts curriculum has an interdisciplinary focus that allows students to create an individualized education. Fully half of Albright students have concentrations that combine two or three fields of learning. Three Albright programs that have received national attention in the past decade are fashion, theatre, and music. Albright was named one of the nation's top private fashion merchandising schools in 2015, 2016 and 2017 by Fashion- Schools.org. The theatre program has been honored by the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival consistently for the past 12 years. Albright's Domino Players have been invited to perform at Kennedy festival II 10 times in the last 15 years (2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). ‚ÄúWaiting for Godot‚Äù (2007) was one of only four productions chosen to perform for the National KCACTF Conference. ‚ÄúClybourne Park‚Äù (2016) and ‚ÄúA Raisin in the Sun‚Äù (2019) were named ‚ÄúOutstanding Production of a Play‚Äù ‚Äì recognizing them as the best college production of their years. ‚ÄúA Raisin in the Sun‚Äù also received eight other national awards, for distinguished performance, scenic and lighting design, director and performances. The Music Industry Studies program at Albright College has been recognized as one of the top 35 music business programs in North America by Billboard magazine. The Albright Creative Research Experience (ACRE) is a multi-disciplinary program that affords undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research or pursue creative endeavors during the three-week January Interim or summer break. The students, who work one-on-one with faculty members, can be from any discipline, from STEM subjects to the humanities. =Rankings= Albright College has been named one of the \\"Best Northeastern\\" schools for 14 consecutive years by The Princeton Review. Albright College has also been named one of the most ethnically and economically diverse schools in the country by U.S News and World Report. In the \\"Campus Ethnic Diversity\\" category, as part of its 2018 Best Colleges rankings, U.S. News ranked Albright 33rd out of 208 national liberal arts colleges. In the ‚ÄúEconomic Diversity‚Äù category, Albright ranked 27th out of 210 national liberal arts schools named. The Economist magazine listed Albright among the top 50 American colleges and universities for economic value in 2015. Athletics and History Albright College athletic teams compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III as a member of the Middle Atlantic Conferences. Charles \\"Pop\\" Kelchner founded the men's basketball team in 1900 and was athletic director at Albright College for 21 years. He was involved in aspects of Major League Baseball for over 50 years. Albright College dedicated the baseball field as Kelchner Field in 1952. Branch Rickey gave the dedication speech, with Connie Mack in attendance. Kelchner was a graduate of Lafayette College with two degrees and was proficient in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Classical Latin and Greek. He served as Professor of Languages and athletic director. Doggie Julian was the head football coach at Albright from 1929 to 1930. Clarence Lester \\"Biggie\\" Munn was the head football coach at Albright College from 1935 to 1936, before coaching Syracuse University (1946), and most notably Michigan State College (1947‚Äì1953), where his 1952 squad won a national championship. William \\"Lone Star\\" Dietz was the Director of Athletics and head football coach at Albright from 1937 to 1942. Dietz led the football team to their first undefeated season in 1937. He previously led Washington State to 1916 Rose Bowl victory. In the National Football League, Dietz had coached the Boston \\"Redskins\\" (1933‚Äì1934), the forerunner of the Washington Redskins. Dietz is in the Albright College Athletic Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1948, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and Albright College played the first intercollegiate football game between an Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institution and a majority-white institution. The Philadelphia Eagles held pre-season training camp at Albright from 1968 through 1972. Dr. Wilbur G. Renken was athletic director and basketball head coach for 38 consecutive seasons. A highly regarded figure in collegiate athletics in general and specifically basketball, Renken was the president of the United States Olympic Basketball Team Selection Committee for the 1976 Olympic Games. He also served as the president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) in 1979‚Äì1980. On October 11, 2017, sophomore backup quarterback Gyree Durante was dismissed from the football team for kneeling during the national anthem before the team's game against Delaware Valley University, going against a collective team decision made before the game to kneel for the coin toss and stand for the anthem. President Fetrow later offered reinstatement to the team to Durante (and two other players who did not fully kneel during the coin toss), saying that further review of the details surrounding the game's events found that \\"what we understood to be shared agreement among players, student leaders and coaches has not been adequately supported.‚Äù. Durante, however, declined reinstatement, citing his former teammates' stated lack of trust in him. WXAC Albright's campus radio station, WXAC 91.3 FM is a student-operated college radio station.

Unlike many evangelicals, however, those on the evangelical left often support and utilize modern biblical criticism and are open to more progressive interpretations of Christian beliefs. They often support a more progressive political platform as well. Many, for example, are opposed to capital punishment and supportive of gun control and welfare programs. In many cases, they are also pacifists. While members of the evangelical left chiefly reside in mainline denominations, they are often heavily influenced by the Anabaptist social tradition. While the evangelical left is related to the wider Christian left, those who are part of the latter category are not always viewed as evangelical. In his 2014 book, Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism (Politics and Culture in Modern America), David R. Swartz argues that during the 1960s and 1970s the evangelical left stood for antiwar, civil rights, and anticonsumer principles while supporting doctrinal and sexual fidelity. Swartz documents the activities of large organizations of the evangelical left included the Sojourners, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Evangelicals for Social Action, and the Association for Public Justice. He also explains how the evangelical left helped influence the broader evangelical movement by helping to elect the first born-again U.S. president, Jimmy Carter, and showing the evangelical right how to politically organize.Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism (Politics and Culture in Modern America), David R.

She studied at Heatherley's and Saint Martin's School of Art, but left to develop her own interest in imaginary subjects, disliking the emphasis on still-life drawing and classical subjects. After she sold work to the Tatler and Bystander, she was taken on by the agents Francis and Mills, leading to a long and consistently successful career. In 1908, she married painter and illustrator Harold Cecil Earnshaw (d. 1937) with whom she had a daughter, Marjorie, and two sons. She died at her home in Fowey, Cornwall, on 5 November 1964, after which her business was carried on by her daughter, Marjorie.  Works  Attwell's initial career was founded on magazine illustration, which she continued throughout her life, but around 1900 she began receiving commissions for book illustration, notably for W & R Chambers and the Raphael House Library of Gift Books. Her early works were somewhat derivative of the style of artists such as her friend Hilda Cowham, Jessie Willcox Smith, John Hassall, and the Heath Robinson brothers. From 1914 onwards, she developed her trademark style of sentimental rotund cuddly infants, which became ubiquitous across a wide range of markets: cards, calendars, nursery equipment and pictures, crockery and dolls. During the 1910s Attwell produced a number of posters for London Transport featuring the children to promote travel to Christmas pantomimes and other causes. She illustrated children's classics such as Mother Goose (1910), Alice in Wonderland (1911), Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales (1914), The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (1915), and an edition of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan and Wendy abridged and written by May Byron (1921). For the gift books published by Messrs Raphael Tuck (Mother Goose, Alice in Wonderland, and later volumes including Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales (1913) and Grimm's Fairy Tales (1925)), she provided line drawings as well as \\"colour work for twelve full-page half- tone plates.\\" Attwell's illustrations caught the attention of Queen Marie of Romania, who wrote children's books and short stories in English. Attwell was invited to spend several weeks at the royal palace in Bucharest in 1922. She also illustrated two long stories of the queen's, which were published by Hodder and Stoughton. Attwell contributed illustrations to popular periodicals such as Tatler, The Bystander, The Daily Graphic, and The Illustrated London News. She produced advertising illustrations for clients such as Vim, and illustrated greeting cards as well. The Lucie Attwell Annual was published from 1922 to 1974, its continuing publication ten years after her death being made possible by extensive re-use of images. In 1926 Shelley Potteries commissioned Attwell to produce designs for children's china ware, following the successful sales of china decorated with designs by Hilda Cowham. Attwell‚Äôs first six designs portrayed scenes involving children, animals and small green elves in green suits ‚Äì these were called 'Boo Boos' and used on cups, mugs, bowls etc.The Collectible World of Mabel Lucie Attwell by John Henty 1999 Gifts for Good Children part II by Maureen Batkin Children's ware designed by Mabel Lucie Attwell She also produced a tea set, comprising a teapot in the shape of a mushroom house, a sugar bowl in the shape of a mushroom with the top cut off and a milk jug in the shape of a green Boo Boo in a coy saluting pose. The response to these designs was enthusiastic and the Pottery Gazette wrote that they were \\"a truly irresistible range of nursery ware, altogether in advance of what was usually put before the trade.\\" Her success continued and from 1937 a series of children figures was introduced, followed by a series of small elves in various poses. Attwell continued to produce designs for Shelley ware which was still being manufactured in the 1960s. Comics In 1943 she also had her own comic strip, named Wot A Life, published in the magazine Playbox. Personal life In 1908, she married painter and illustrator Harold Cecil Earnshaw and became the mother of one daughter and two sons.

It is brown overall, with the tegmina having a conspicuous lateral pale stripe or margin, and the pronotum (head shield) with a sharply contrasting pale or yellow margin. (The article comprises the whole issue.) It is very similar in appearance to the American cockroach and may be easily mistaken for it. It is, however, slightly smaller than the American cockroach, and has a yellow margin on the thorax and yellow streaks at its sides near the wing base. Despite its name, the Australian cockroach is a cosmopolitan species, and an introduced species in Australia. P. australasiae probably originated in Africa. It is very common in the southern United States and in tropical climates, and can be found in many locations throughout the world due to its travels by shipping and commerce between locations. Lateral view The insect can travel quickly, often darting out of sight when someone enters a room, and can fit into small cracks and under doors despite its fairly large size. It is known to be very mobile; its wings allow it to be quite a capable flier. It prefers warmer climates and is not cold-tolerant, but it may be able to survive indoors in colder climates. It does well in moist conditions, but also can tolerate dry conditions as long as water is available. It often lives around the perimeter of buildings. It appears to prefer eating plants more than its relatives do, but can feed on a wide array of organic (including decaying) matter. Like most cockroaches, it is a scavenger. It may come indoors to look for food and even to live, but in warm weather, it may move outdoors and enter buildings looking for food. This species can be found in nature in tropical parts of Australia; it has also been found along the east coast of Australia, from Cape York to the Victorian border.

The model is contrasted with the correspondence theory of truth. A positive tenet is the idea that truth is a property of whole systems of propositions and can be ascribed to individual propositions only derivatively according to their coherence with the whole. While modern coherence theorists hold that there are many possible systems to which the determination of truth may be based upon coherence, others, particularly those with strong religious beliefs, hold that the truth only applies to a single absolute system. In general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within the whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple formal coherence. For example, the coherence of the underlying set of concepts is considered to be a critical factor in judging validity. In other words, the set of base concepts in a universe of discourse must form an intelligible paradigm before many theorists consider that the coherence theory of truth is applicable. History In modern philosophy, the coherence theory of truth was defended by Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel,Elizabeth Millan, Friedrich Schlegel and the Emergence of Romantic Philosophy, SUNY Press, 2012, p. 49. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Harold Henry Joachim (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory).Harold Henry Joachim (1868‚Äî1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy) However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.The Correspondence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily Brand Blanshard (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and Nicholas Rescher. Varieties According to one view, the coherence theory of truth regards truth as coherence within some specified set of sentences, propositions or beliefs.The Coherence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) It is the \\"theory of knowledge which maintains that truth is a property primarily applicable to any extensive body of consistent propositions, and derivatively applicable to any one proposition in such a system by virtue of its part in the system\\".Benjamin, A. Cornelius (1962), \\"Coherence Theory of Truth\\", in Dagobert D. Runes (ed.), Dictionary of Philosophy, Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, p. 58. Ideas like this are a part of the philosophical perspective known as confirmation holism.Quine, W. V., and Ullian, J. S. (1978), The Web of Belief, Random House, New York, NY, Chapter VIII. Coherence theories of truth claim that coherence and consistency are important features of a theoretical system, and that these properties are sufficient to its truth. To state it in the reverse, that \\"truth\\" exists only within a system, and doesn't exist outside of a system. According to another version by H. H. Joachim (the philosopher credited with the definitive formulation of the theory, in his book The Nature of Truth, published in 1906), truth is a systematic coherence that involves more than logical consistency.Harold Henry Joachim (1868‚Äî1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy) In this view, a proposition is true to the extent that it is a necessary constituent of a systematically coherent whole. Others of this school of thought, for example, Brand Blanshard, hold that this whole must be so interdependent that every element in it necessitates and even entails every other element. Exponents of this view infer that the most complete truth is a property solely of a unique coherent system, called the absolute, and that humanly knowable propositions and systems have a degree of truth that is proportionate to how fully they approximate this ideal.Baylis, Charles A. (1962), \\"Truth\\", in Dagobert D. Runes (ed.), Dictionary of Philosophy, Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ. Criticism Perhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is Bertrand Russell's. He maintained that since both a belief and its negation will, individually, cohere with at least one set of beliefs, this means that contradictory beliefs can be shown to be true according to coherence theory, and therefore that the theory cannot work. However, what most coherence theorists are concerned with is not all possible beliefs, but the set of beliefs that people actually hold. The main problem for a coherence theory of truth, then, is how to specify just this particular set, given that the truth of which beliefs are actually held can only be determined by means of coherence.

The term is similar to rector and is in contrast to a vicar, a cleric whose revenue is usually, at least partially, appropriated by a larger organization. Today the term is normally used for some parish clergy of non-Roman Catholic churches, in particular in the Anglican tradition in which a parson is the incumbent of a parochial benefice: a parish priest or a rector; in this sense a parson can be compared with a vicar. The title parson can be applied to clergy from certain other Protestant denominations. A parson is often housed in a church-owned home known as a parsonage.Anthony Jennings, The Old Rectory: The History of the English Parsonage, Continuum, 2009; Anglicanism William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England says that a parson is a parish priest with the fullest legal rights to the parish properties: :A parson, persona ecclesiae, is one that has full possession of all the rights of a parochial church. He is called parson, persona, because by his person the church, which is an invisible body, is represented; and he is in himself a body corporate, in order to protect and defend the rights of the church (which he personates) by a perpetual succession. He is sometimes called the rector, or governor, of the church: but the appellation of parson, (however it may be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use) is the most legal, most beneficial, and most honorable title that a parish priest can enjoy; because such a one, (Sir Edward Coke observes) and he only, is said vicem seu personam ecclesiae gerere (\\"to carry out the business of the church in person\\") :: ‚Äî Bl. Comm. I.11.V, p. *372 Legally, parish priests are separately given spiritual and temporal jurisdiction (they are instituted and inducted). The spiritual responsibility is termed the cure of souls, and one holding such a cure is a curate, which was also given to parish assistants, or assistant curates. The title parson, however, refers to the temporal jurisdiction over the churches and glebe. Depending on how the tithes were apportioned, a parson may be a rector or a vicar. A parish priest who received no tithes was legally a perpetual curate (to distinguish him from assistant curates). However, historically, many perpetual curates, as they were technically parsons (having temporal jurisdiction), preferred to use this latter title. This led to the term parson having three senses. It could refer to any clergyman who was in charge of the parish church (rectors, vicars or perpetual curates) without distinction; it could, through actual use, refer simply to perpetual curates, or it could, through popular use, refer to any member of the clergy, even assistant curates. An Act of Parliament in 1868, changed the way that parochial clergy were paid, and permitted perpetual curates to be called vicars. This led to the rapid abandonment of the title parson in favour of vicar, to the extent that now, as previously for parson, the term vicar is often used for any cleric of the Church of England. Ireland In Ulster, in the early 17th century, every parish had a vicar and a parson instead of a co-arb and an erenagh. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass (‚Äòserveth the cure‚Äô) and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality. As he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal. However, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in Tyrone. In the Diocese of Clogher, the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the Diocese of Derry, church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands (‚Äòtemporalities‚Äô). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual tribute to the bishop. In places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the income in kind from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the Bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the Diocese of Armagh the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof because they received the entire income from the termon lands.

The couple produced numerous sexploitation films, and Sarli is considered one of the biggest stars of the genre. A sexploitation film (or \\"sex-exploitation film\\") is a class of independently produced, low-budget feature film that is generally associated with the 1960s and early 1970s, and that serves largely as a vehicle for the exhibition of non-explicit sexual situations and gratuitous nudity. The genre is a subgenre of exploitation films. Sexploitation films were generally exhibited in urban grindhouse theatres, the precursor to the adult movie theaters of the 1970s and 1980s that featured hardcore pornography content. The term soft-core is often used to designate non-explicit sexploitation films after the general legalisation of hardcore content. Nudist films are often considered to be subgenres of the sex-exploitation genre as well. \\"Nudie\\" films and \\"Nudie-cuties\\" are associated genres. History Following a series of United States Supreme Court rulings in the late 1950s and 1960s, increasingly explicit sex films were distributed. In 1957, Roth v. United States established that sex and obscenity were not synonymous. The genre first emerged in the U.S. around 1960. There were initially three broad types: \\"nudie cuties\\" such as The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959), films set in nudist camps like Daughter of the Sun (1962) and somewhat more \\"artistic\\" foreign pictures, such as The Twilight Girls (1961).Sconce, p. 20 Nudie cuties were popular in the early 1960s, and were a progression from the nudist camp films of the 1950s.Sconce, p. 49 The Supreme Court had previously ruled that films set in nudist camps were exempt from the general ban on film nudity, as they were deemed to be educational. In the early 1960s, films that purported to be documentaries and were thus \\"educational\\" enabled sexploitation producers to evade the censors.Sconce, p. 60 Nudie cuties were soon supplanted by \\"roughies,\\" which commonly featured male violence against women, including kidnapping, rape and murder.Sconce, p.50 Lorna (1964) by Russ Meyer is widely considered to be the first roughie.Sconce, p. 52 Herschell Gordon Lewis and David F. Friedman's Scum of the Earth! (1963) is another film that is cited as among the first in this genre. Other notable roughie directors include Doris Wishman. Sexploitation films initially played in grindhouse theatresSconce, p. 42 and struggling independent theaters; however, by the end of the decade they were playing in established cinema chains. As the genre developed during the 1960s films began showing scenes of simulated sex.Sconce, p. 28 The films were opposed by religious groups and by the MPAA, which was concerned that sexploitation films were cutting into the profits of major film distributors.Sconce, p. 35 Customers who attended screenings of sexploitation films were often characterised by the mainstream media as deviant, \\"dirty old men\\" and \\"raincoaters.\\"Sconce, p. 19 In the mid-1960s some newspapers began banning advertisements for the films.Sconce, p. 36 By the late 1960s the films were attracting a larger and broader audience, however, including couples rather than the single males who originally made up the vast majority of patrons. The genre rapidly declined in the early 1970s due to advertising bans, the closure of many grindhouses and drive-in theaters and the growth of hardcore pornography in the \\"Golden Age of Porn.\\" White coaters In the late 1960s, American obscenity laws were tested by the Swedish film I Am Curious (Yellow). After the 1969 ruling by the Supreme Court that the film was not obsceneSupreme Court of the United States (Byrne v. Karalexis, 396 U.S. 976 (1969) and 401 U.S. 216 (1971)) because of its educational context, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of sexploitation films produced following this same format. These were widely referred to as \\"white coaters,\\" because, in these films, a doctor dressed in a white coat would give an introduction to the graphic content that followed, qualifying the film as \\"educational.\\" The ruling led to a surge in the production of sex films. Language of Love and other Swedish and American films capitalised on this idea until the laws were relaxed. Notable sexploitation directors * Andy Milligan * Armando B√≥ * Carl Monson * David F.

On watch in the Argonne Forest on May 14, 1918, he fought off a German raid in hand-to-hand combat, killing multiple German soldiers and rescuing a fellow soldier while experiencing 21 wounds, in an action that was brought to the nation's attention by coverage in the New York World and The Saturday Evening Post later that year. On June 2, 2015 he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in a posthumous ceremony at the White House. In 1918, racism against African Americans was common among white U.S. soldiers in the U.S. military, but French attitudes differed. Johnson was recognized by the French with a Croix de guerre with star and bronze palm, and was the first U.S. soldier in World War I to receive that honor. Johnson died, poor and in obscurity, in 1929. From 1919 on, Henry Johnson's story has been part of wider consideration of treatment of African Americans in the Great War. There was a long struggle to achieve awards for him from the U.S. military. He was finally awarded the Purple Heart in 1996. In 2002, the U.S. military awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. Previous efforts to secure the Medal of Honor failed, but in 2015 he was posthumously honored with the award. Early life and education Johnson said that he was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on July 15, 1892, when he registered for the World War I draft, but he used other dates on other documents, so he might not have known the exact date of his birth. He moved to Albany, New York, when he was in his early teens. He worked as a redcap porter at the Albany Union Station on Broadway. Military career Henry Johnson biographical cartoon by Charles Alston, 1943 Croix de Guerre. Note, too, the two wound chevrons on his lower right sleeve.left A 1918 lithograph dramatizing Johnson's actions in the war Johnson enlisted in the United States Military on June 5, 1917, joining the all-black New York National Guard 15th Infantry Regiment, which, when mustered into Federal service, was redesignated as the 369th Infantry Regiment based in Harlem. The 369th Infantry joined the 185th Infantry Brigade upon arrival in France, but the unit was relegated to labor service duties instead of combat training. The 185th Infantry Brigade was in turn assigned on January 5, 1918, to the 93rd Infantry Division. Although General John J. Pershing wished to keep the U.S. Army autonomous, he \\"loaned\\" the 369th to the 161st Division of the French Army. Supposedly, the unreported and unofficial reason he was willing to detach the African-American regiments from U.S. command was that vocal white U.S. soldiers refused to fight alongside black troops. These regiments suffered considerable harassment by white U.S. soldiers and even denigration by the American Expeditionary Force headquarters, which went so far as to release the notorious pamphlet Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops, which \\"warned\\" French civilian authorities of the alleged inferior nature and supposed tendencies of African-American troops to commit sexual assaults. Johnson arrived in France on New Year's Day, 1918. The French Army and people had no such problem and were happy and welcoming to accept the reinforcements. Among the first regiments to arrive in France, and among the most highly decorated when it returned, was the 369th Infantry, which later became famous as the \\"Harlem Hellfighters.\\" The 369th was an all-black regiment under the command of mostly white officers including their commander, Colonel William Hayward. The idea of a black New York National Guard regiment was first put forward by Charles W. Fillmore, a black New Yorker. Governor Charles Seymour Whitman, inspired by the brave showing of the black 10th Cavalry in Mexico, authorized the project. He appointed Colonel Hayward to carry out the task of organizing the unit, and Hayward gave Fillmore a commission as a captain in the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard. The 15th New York Infantry Regiment became the 369th United States Infantry Regiment prior to engaging in combat in France. The 369th got off to a rocky departure from the United States, making three attempts over a period of months to sail for France before finally getting out of sight of land. Even then, their transport, which had stopped and anchored because of a sudden snow storm that arose before they could get out of the harbor, was struck by another ship due to the poor visibility. The captain of the transport, the Pocahontas, wanted to turn back, much to the dismay of his passengers. The by now angry and impatient members of the 369th, led by Hayward, took a very dim view of any further delay. Since the damage to the ship was well above the water line, the ship's captain admitted that there was no danger of sinking. Hayward then informed the captain that he saw no reason to turn back except cowardice. Hayward's men repaired the damage themselves and the ship sailed on. According to Hayward's notes, they \\"landed at Brest. Right side up\\" on December 27, 1917. They acquitted themselves well once they finally got to France. However, it was a while before they saw combat. The French Army assigned Johnson's regiment to Outpost 20 on the edge of the Argonne Forest in the Champagne region of France and equipped them with French rifles and helmets. While on observation post duty on the night of May 14, 1918, Private Johnson came under attack by a large German raiding party, which may have numbered as many as 24 German soldiers. Using grenades, the butt of his rifle, a bolo knife, and his bare fists, Johnson repelled the Germans, thereby rescuing Needham Roberts from capture and saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Johnson suffered 21 wounds during this ordeal. This act of valor earned him the nickname of \\"Black Death\\", as a sign of respect for his prowess in combat. The story of Johnson's exploits first came to national attention in an article by Irvin S. Cobb entitled \\"Young Black Joe\\" published in the August 24, 1918 Saturday Evening Post. Returning home, now Sergeant Johnson participated (with his regiment) in a victory parade on Fifth Avenue in New York City in February 1919. Johnson was then paid to take part in a series of lecture tours. He appeared one evening in St. Louis, and instead of delivering the expected tale of racial harmony in the trenches, he instead revealed the abuse that black soldiers had suffered, such as white soldiers refusing to share trenches with blacks. Soon after this a warrant was issued for Johnson's arrest for wearing his uniform beyond the prescribed date of his commission and paid lecturing engagements dried up.Negro with a Hat, The Rise and Fall of Marcus Garvey and his Dream of Mother Africa, Colin Grant. p.113 Military awards The French government awarded Johnson the Croix de guerre with a special citation and a golden palm. He was the first American to receive the award. In June 1996, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart by President Bill Clinton. In February 2003, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second highest award, was presented to Herman A. Johnson, one of the Tuskegee Airmen, on behalf of his father.See General Order No. 9, 18 November 2005, at http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/go0509.pdf. John Howe, a Vietnam War veteran who had campaigned tirelessly for recognition for Johnson, and U.S. Army Major General Nathaniel James, President of the 369th Veterans' Association, were present at the ceremony in Albany.Henry Johnson, Sergeant, United States Army at www.arlingtoncemetery.net On May 14, 2015, the White House announced that Johnson would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, presented by President Barack Obama. In the June 2 ceremony, Johnson's medal was received on his behalf by Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard. Obama said, \\"The least we can do is to say, 'We know who you are, we know what you did for us. We are forever grateful.'\\" =Medal of Honor= On June 2, 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor to Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard on behalf of Private Johnson. The award was presented to Wilson instead of next- of-kin due to Johnson having no living relatives. The official citation reads: Command Sgt. Maj. Louis Wilson of the New York Army National Guard accepts the Medal of Honor on behalf of Johnson Later life and death Veterans Bureau records show that a \\"permanent and total disability\\" rating was granted to Johnson on September 16, 1927, as a result of his tuberculosis. Additional Veterans Bureau records refer to Johnson receiving monthly compensation and regular visits by Veterans Bureau medical personnel until his death. Johnson died on July 1, 1929, in Washington, D.C., of myocarditis. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on July 6, 1929. Legacy Grave of Henry Johnson at Arlington National Cemetery In 1919, co-founder of the American Legion Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., son of former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, referred to Johnson as one of the \\"five bravest Americans\\" to have served in World War I. Interest in obtaining fitting recognition for Johnson grew during the 1970s and 1980s. In November 1991 a monument was erected in Albany, New York's Washington Park in his honor, and a section of Northern Boulevard was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard. In December 2004, the Postal facility at 747 Broadway was renamed the \\"United States Postal Service Henry Johnson Annex\\". On September 4, 2007, the Brighter Choice Foundation in Albany, New York dedicated the Henry Johnson Charter School. Johnson's granddaughter was in attendance. A 1918 commercial poster honoring Johnson's wartime heroics was the subject of a 2012 episode of the PBS television series History Detectives. As of December 3, 2014, the national defense bill included a provision, added by Senator Chuck Schumer, to award Johnson the Medal of Honor. For many years, it was thought that Herman Archibald Johnson was the son of Henry Johnson. In tracking Henry Johnson's genealogy prior to his being awarded the Medal of Honor, however, it was discovered that there was not a family connection. Regarding this, the Army was quoted as saying, \\"While we appreciate the Johnson family fighting for the award and keeping the memory and valorous acts of Henry Johnson alive, we regretfully cannot recognize them as PNOK,\\" or primary next of kin. In December 2014, the City School District of Albany established a Junior Reserve officers' Training Program (JROTC) at Albany High School named the Henry Johnson Battalion in honor of Johnson.http://www.albanyschools.org/district/communications/DistrictNews/2015-16/JROTC.promotions.4-8-16.htm Currently the program enrolls over 100 cadets.

It contains the enzyme alpha- galactosidase (Œ±-GAL). It was introduced as a liquid, but that has been discontinued and it is now available only as tablets and strawberry-flavored \\"Meltaways\\". Beano is marketed and distributed by Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.  Mechanism of action  Beano contains the enzyme Œ±-GAL, which is derived from the fungus Aspergillus niger. The enzyme works in the digestive tract to break down the complex or branching sugars (polysaccharides and oligosaccharides) in foods such as legumes (beans and peanuts) and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts, among others). The enzyme breaks those complex sugars into simple sugars, making these foods somewhat more digestible, and reducing intestinal gas. The polysaccharides and oligosaccharides found in these foods might otherwise pass through the small intestine unaffected. Once in the large intestine, those sugars may be metabolized by intestinal flora, fermenting to produce the gases that cause discomfort and flatulence. Two randomized controlled trials show reduction in gas by subjects taking oral Œ±-GAL. Another study indicates it may interfere with the diabetic medication acarbose.  History  Beano was developed in 1990 by Alan Kligerman of AkPharma after research into gas- causing vegetables that had begun in 1981. The idea for such a product was proposed at least as early as the 1780s in Benjamin Franklin's essay \\"A Letter To A Royal Academy\\". In 1991, Kligerman was awarded the inaugural Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine for inventing Beano. Its patent was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in 2001 from Block Drug. GlaxoSmithKline sold Beano and 16 other brands to Prestige Brands in 2012. Beano received a on August 29, 1995. The estimated expiration date of this patent is December 5, 2014. , more than four dozen competing products were on the market. In April 2014, the brand introduced Beano +Dairy Defense.  Use in brewing  Simple sugars are also produced as a consequence of the malting process that eventually produces beer. The complex sugars are not broken down by the yeast, and are eventually consumed by the beer drinker, possibly causing flatulence. Homebrewers have found adding Beano to their brew may produce a beer that has a less malty flavor. The Beano breaks the complex sugars into simple sugars, and these simple sugars are consumed by the yeast, producing alcohol (or some acetic acid in the aerobic reactions in early fermentation).

She retained her former name. Before being pressed into service by the United States Navy, the SS James Adger was a United States Mail Steamship operating between Charleston, South Carolina and New York City, New York. Owned by James Adger II (James Adger & Co) of Charleston, she was seized while in New York City at the outset of the Civil War and converted for military duty by the Union Navy. James Adger was built at New York City by William H. Webb in 1851. Her side-lever engine was supplied by the Allaire Iron Works.Bauer and Roberts, p. 87. James Adger was purchased at New York for the sum of $85,000\\"To The Projectors Of Steam Companies\\", Daily Southern Cross, 1866-08-20, p. 4. from Spofford, Tileston & Co., on 20 July 1861, and commissioned at New York Navy Yard on 20 September 1861, Commander John B. Marchand in command. Civil War service =The Trent Affair, 1861= James Adger departed New York on 16 October 1861 in pursuit of the CSS Nashville, a Confederate cruiser reported to have escaped from Charleston, South Carolina with the South's ministers to England and France, James M. Mason and John Slidell. She arrived at Queenstown, Ireland after an extremely stormy passage in October and spent November cruising in quest of her elusive quarry. The diplomats were apprehended by on 8 November. While in port, the captain of James Adger began the legal questions that would be used in the Trent Affair by loudly speaking of his mission while intoxicated on brandy. Earl Russell would hear of his mission and set the Law offices of the Crown to work deciding on the status of diplomats as a form of contraband. =South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 1861-1863= James Adger arrived Hampton Roads, Va. on 2 December and three days later was ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont ordered Comdr. Marchand to sail in James Adger to Georgetown, S.C., and assume command of the blockade there. She arrived off Georgetown, S.C. on 24 December and served with such efficiency that on 7 March 1862, Comdr. Marchand was ordered to Charleston to command the blockade at that critical port. At Charleston, smooth teamwork was the key to success, and James Adger was unusually adept in cooperating with other ships in the area to assure the effectiveness of the blockade. As senior ship, she usually remained on station while others chased blockade runners; from time to time, she took part in a capture herself. On 18 March, she joined four other Union ships in capturing Emily St. Pierre attempting to slip into Charleston with a cargo of 2,173 bales of gunny cloth sorely needed for baling cotton, the South's main export and source of foreign credit. She helped on 29 May in capturing Elizabeth, a steamer trying to enter Charleston with a cargo of munitions. She assisted Keystone State and in driving off and pursuing her old adversary Nashville ‚Äî now a blockade runner named Thomas L. Wragg ‚Äî trying to slip into Charleston. James Adger sailed for Baltimore on 19 September for repairs and departed for the South on 31 December touching at Hampton Roads on 2 January 1863 to take monitor in tow before proceeding to Beaufort and Port Royal in preparation for an attack on Charleston. Arriving Port Royal on 19 January, the ships learned that Nashville, now a privateer called Rattlesnake, was in the Ogeechee River. James Adger stood out of Port Royal, monitor Montauk in tow on 22 January and steamed to Ossabaw Sound, where she arrived two days later. Montauk ascended the Ogeechee independently to begin operations which resulted in the destruction of Rattlesnake on 28 February. Meanwhile, James Adger ‚Äî her vital towing service completed ‚Äî returned to Port Royal on 29 January. On 2 April, the veteran ship became flagship for Rear Admiral Du Pont while he supervised final preparations for his powerful monitor attack upon Charleston. After the tough ironclads were driven back by incredibly intense fire from Confederate batteries, James Adger towed crippled monitors to Port Royal and on 29 April sailed from Port Royal towing north for repairs, arriving New York on 4 May. Back in Port Royal on 16 May, James Adger was assigned blockade duty off Charleston. A month later, she was recalled to Port Royal to embark prisoners captured with Atlanta for passage to Fort Monroe, whence she steamed to Philadelphia for repairs. She arrived Philadelphia 25 June but immediately after coaling sailed in pursuit of Confederate commerce railer CSS Tacony, then operating against Union merchantmen far up the East Coast. She arrived New York on 3 July. =North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, 1863= Four days later, James Adger ‚Äî not yet repaired ‚Äî received orders to Wilmington for duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Arriving Wilmington on 27 July, she was stationed off New Inlet, where five days later she assisted and in taking Confederate steamer Kate. On 8 November, with the assistance of she captured Cornubia, an iron side wheeler bringing in a valuable cargo of arms, ammunition, and chemicals. Moreover, a package of documents thrown overboard before the capture, when plucked out of the sea, divulged information so important to the South that Cornubias captain lamented, \\"though the Cornubia is a small vessel the Confederate Government could better have afforded to lose almost any other...\\" The next morning, James Adger took Confederate steamer Robert E. Lee coming into Wilmington from Bermuda with a cargo of arms and Army clothing sorely needed by Lee's soldiers. Schooner Ella, approaching Wilmington with a cargo of salt and yard goods from Nassau, Bahamas, was James Adgers next victim, surrendering on 26 November. Without the normal overhaul periods due ships and men, service was taking a daily toll in wear and tear. When the ship's long postponed repairs could be delayed no longer, James Adger sailed north and decommissioned at Philadelphia on 28 December for the necessary yard work. =South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Caribbean, 1864-1865= After recommissioning on 17 June 1864, James Adger served in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron until the end of the war. On 21 April 1865, Secretary Gideon Welles ordered her to Mariguana Passage (now Mayaguana Passage) in the Bahamas to escort a convoy of California-bound ships. Following a visit to New York, she cruised in the Caribbean off Panama and Colombia from August 1865-February 1866. James Adger decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 2 May and was sold at New York to James B. Campbell on 9 October. As of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named James Adger.

Produced by Ivan Tors and directed by James B. Clark, the film centers on a 12-year-old boy living with his parents in the Florida Keys who befriends an injured wild dolphin. The boy and the dolphin become inseparable, eventually overcoming the misgivings of the boy's fisherman father. The film introduced the popular song Flipper by Dunham and Henry Vars and inspired the subsequent television series of the same name (1964-1967) and film sequels. Plot Sandy Ricks is a young boy living in the Florida Keys who rescues and befriends a dolphin injured by a harpoon. His father, fisherman Porter Ricks disapproves, as dolphins compete for fish, which jeopardizes the family income. He is also upset that, after befriending the dolphin, Sandy neglects his chores, especially those assigned by Porter to repair items damaged by the hurricane from which Sandy and Porter escape at the beginning of the film. Sandy names the dolphin Flipper, and Flipper recovers from the wound and puts on a show to entertain the neighborhood children. Porter, seeing Flipper as both a threat to his nets and fish and a distraction to Sandy's chores, lets the recovered Flipper swim out of the pen to the open sea, despite Sandy's tearful plea to keep the pet that he has come to love. Flipper returns to the Ricks' pen, much to Sandy's delight, but devours Porter's entire catch of pompano, which were caught only because Flipper guided Sandy to the fish. The loss is keenly felt because of a red plague killing local fish in large numbers. Porter harshly berates Sandy for allowing Flipper to jump into the holding pen of valuable fish waiting to go to market. Reduced to tears, Sandy retreats to his bedroom as Porter's wife Martha reminds Porter that Sandy is just a child. Determined to make up for the loss, Sandy sets off to find more fish, and is led by Flipper to a large school of fish near a reef. Later, Sandy is rescued from a threatening shark by Flipper, and the grateful father draws closer to his son. Porter is finally convinced that Flipper did indeed help Sandy find fish and that there are enough fish for the local residents as well as the dolphins.

After he sent the story to his friend, producer Ivan Tors, Tors expressed interest in making it into a film.Gonzalez, Gaspar. \\"The House That Flipper Built,\\" Biscayne Times, March 2012, available online at Biscaynetimes.com, accessed May 23, 2015. Filmed in color in 1962 and released in 1963, Flipper has several underwater sequences, along with scenes of the trained dolphin performing stunts. Flipper was actually Mitzie (1958‚Äì1972), a female trained at the Santini Porpoise School (later the Dolphin Research Center) by Milton and Virginia Santini, who are credited in the film. Mitzie is buried at the Dolphin Research Center, where her grave is the first stop on the center's public tours. In addition to Mitzie, four other dolphins were filmed for the production of the movie. Two of the dolphins, Little Bit, a female, and Mr. Gipper, a male, mated at the Santini Porpoise School, yielding a calf named Tursi in 1973 who still lives at the Dolphin Research Center. Sequels A film sequel, Flipper's New Adventure, was filmed in late 1963 and released in June 1964. That same year, a television series inspired by the movie, also titled Flipper, began and ran until 1967. A 1990s television revival featured Jessica Alba. In 1996, a movie remake was released, starring Paul Hogan and Elijah Wood.

Background The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares: The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable.

The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights. (Article III, Section 5)..... The Supreme Court of the Philippines, ruling in 2003 and 2006 in the landmark case of Estrada vs. Escritor, established the doctrine of benevolent neutrality-accommodation. The 2006 ruling, penned by former Chief Justice Puno, explained benevolent- neutrality in the context of U.S. jurisprudence as follows: The ruling went on to cite a U.S. Supreme Court decision which had held that if prohibiting the exercise of religion is merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended. Though concurring in the decision, Justice O'Connor dissented strongly from the rationale, arguing that a compelling state interest test should have been applied.\\"As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor insisted in her strong dissent from the rationale in Smith, the First Amendment was \\"enacted precisely to protect the rights of those whose religious practices are not shared by the majority and may be viewed with hostility....

For the Court to deem this command a luxury, is to denigrate [t]he very purpose of a Bill of Rights.\\", Echoing Justice O'Connor's point from the U.S. case, the ruling in Estrada vs. Escritor went on to quote her as having said that strict scrutiny is appropriate for free exercise challenges because ‚Äú[t]he compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment‚Äôs mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society. The ruling then declared Underlying the compelling state interest test is the notion that free exercise is a fundamental right and that laws burdening it should be subject to strict scrutiny, and summarized a three-part compelling state interest test by quoting Michael W. McConnell as follows: The ruling noted that the then- current prevailing view under U.S. law is that there are no required accommodation under the First Amendment, although it permits of legislative accommodations. Considering Philippine jurisprudence, though, the ruling said: These landmark decisions in Estrada vs. Escritor established that benevolent neutrality-accommodation is the framework by which free exercise cases must be decided in the Philippines. This amounts to a requirement that any law which conflicts with a violator's sincerely held religious beliefs must pass a strict scrutiny test in order to be enforceable. History By passing through the numerous phases of colonial occupation, the relationship between religion and government in the Philippines has repeatedly changed. The country had close ties between the Catholic Church and the government during the Spanish colonial period from 1565 to 1898. The American concept of separation of church and state was introduced during the American colonial period in the Philippine Constitution of 1899 and remains a part of the Philippine constitution today. =Spanish Period= Beginning with the Christianization of most of the Philippines in the 16th century, political power was shared by the Catholic Church and the Spanish civil authorities. Horacio de la Costa, a Filipino Jesuit historian, mentions that the rules governing the cooperation of the two entities was set in the ‚ÄúPatronato Real de las Indias‚Äù, a combination of law and jurisprudence that governed the delicate relationship of the Holy See and the Spanish monarchy regarding colonial affairs. In the agreements, the Catholic clergy gave the Spanish monarchy the responsibility of promoting, maintaining, and defending Catholicsm in... all Spanish dominions overseas (1). In return, the Spanish were permitted to exercise numerous rights to autonomously govern the colonial Catholic Church virtually independent of Roman jurisdiction. On the other hand, Teodoro Agoncillo, a Filipino historian from the University of the Philippines, mentions that the collaboration enabled the Spanish to readily subjugate the Indios (natives of the Philippines) by a potent combination of secular and religious might. The successful Legazpi conquest of the Philippines in 1565 recognized the power of clergy by bringing along Augustinian friar, navigator and priest Andr√©s de Urdaneta, to help control the natives. Other Spanish rulers acknowledged the importance of clergy. A Mexican viceroy (quoted in Agoncillo) said that in each friar in the Philippines, they had a captain and a whole army. However, Church involvement had numerous ill effects, as antifriar Marcelo H. del Pilar of the late 19th century complains: ... the friars control all the fundamental forces of society in the Philippines. They control the educational system, for they own the University of Santo Tom√°s, and are the local inspectors of every primary school. They control the minds of the people because in a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize the pulpit and confessionals to publicly or secretly influence the people. In-fighting continued and reached its peak when the Gomburza, a triad of priests composed of Mariano G√≥mez, Jos√© Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, were executed by civil authorities in 1872 after being implicated in the failed Cavite Mutiny in that same year. Popular discontent ensued, leading to the Philippine Revolution some twenty years later. The Spanish were unable to cope with multiple uprisings since their limited military was overextended. Bereft of the civil protection, clerics were at their most vulnerable. Rather than accept change, numerous friars handled the Mausers and Remingtons when the tide of battle was going against the colonial government. As the status quo was being changed, the ties between Church and State began to fall apart. Filipino nationalists in 1898 framed a constitution for an independent Philippine republic. There were heated discussions on the provision on state and religion. Felipe Calder√≥n presented his draft proposal calling for Catholicism to be made a state religion. According to Jesuit historian John Schumacher, Calder√≥n then attacked the position of Apolinario Mabini who insisted on the separation of church and state. The Calder√≥n proposal, however, was defeated by a single vote, and the provision was finally passed. The constitution of 1899 states in Article 5: :The State recognizes the freedom and equality of all religions, as well as the separation of Church and State. =American Period= Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States in 1898. By the end of February 1902, American forces had defeated the Philippine forces seeking to establish an independent Philippine republic. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 provided, among other things, \\"That no law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and that the free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed.\\" Schumacher cites that William Howard Taft, the head of the Second Philippine Commission and the first civil governor of the Philippine Islands, was very much aware of the need to defuse anti-friar feeling throughout the islands. He requested the Spanish friars be given leave of their parish posts. Many of the friars left voluntarily, and were replaced by native Filipino priests in lower ranks and American bishops in the ranks of the episcopacy. Negotiations also began for the compulsory sale of vast Catholic Church holdings. Although the sale was affected by pressure from influential sectors like some bishops and certain delegates, it achieved Taft‚Äôs goal of sequestering all the Catholic Church lands, something that the ill-fated Philippine Republic had failed to achieve. After taking the land, the governor intended to redistribute the land. This not only reduced the financial position of the Catholic Church, but also diminished the influential clout it had during the Spanish colonial period. American jurisprudence reintroduced separation of church and state relying on the First Amendment and the metaphor of Thomas Jefferson on the wall of separation... between church and state (10), but the Philippine experience has shown that this theoretical wall of separation has been crossed several times by secular authorities. Schumacher states that in 1906, the Philippine Supreme Court intervened in the issue of parish ownership by returning assets seized by the Philippine Independent Church, while certain charitable organizations managed or influenced by the Catholic Church were either returned or sequestered. =Commonwealth Era= The provision of the 1935 charter on religion mimicked the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but the sentences :The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall be forever allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights were appended and this section became the basis for the non-establishment of religion and freedom of religion in the Philippines. =Post Colonial Era= With the guarantee of religious freedom in the Philippines, the Catholic clergy subsequently remained in the political background as a source of moral influence for many voters during elections until today. Political candidates generally court the clergy for support, although this does not guarantee victory for a candidate. The Philippines was placed under martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos and relations changed dramatically, as some bishops opposed the martial law. =Marcos Dictatorship= A new constitution was ratified in 1973 which included the separation of church and state clause, signaling a new development in the body of law on religious affairs. Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that the fact that he [Marcos] tried to do it does not deny the validity of the separation of church and state. Sharia District Courts (SDCs) and Sharia Circuit Courts (SCCs) were created in 1977 through Presidential Decree 1083, which is also known as the Code of Muslim Personal Laws. Islamic law only applies to civil cases involving all Muslims nationwide. Cases are handled in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and a couple of Mindanao provinces that are not part of ARMM by both sharia district and circuit courts, organised into five sharia districts. Outside these areas, sharia-related cases are processed in civil courts under a session from the five sharia districts.Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines . All other cases, including criminal ones, are dealt with by local civil courts. The Catholic Church was instrumental in winning support for Corazon Aquino who replaced Marcos as president with Cardinal Sin calling for support. Aquino then initiated a new constitutional commission to frame a new charter again for the country. It is noted that Roman Catholic religious and clergy like Christine Tan, R.G.S., a nun, Joaquin Bernas, S.J., and Bishop Teodoro C. Bacani became part of the 1986 Constitutional Commission and left their mark on the promulgation of the charter and its numerous provisions on the Church and state. =Contemporary History= The CBCP was embroiled in a controversy in 2011 over millions of pesos in donations from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) at the behest of then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. According to a Commission on Audit report in 2009, some bishops received donations for the purchase of vehicles from the PCSO. Critics claim the donations was given to ensure Church support for Arroyo, who was then buffeted by scandals and repeated threats of impeachment. The bishops were summoned during the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee investigation on the anomalies within the PCSO, with the bishops returning the vehicles donated to them. Senator Teofisto Guingona, chairman of the committee, said that since the vehicles were used for secular purposes, the donation is not considered as a violation of the Constitution, but added that the issue was a \\"litmus test to the Constitution\\" since the Constitution prohibits favoring a particular religious organization.

Habitat The smokybrown cockroach is very common in Japan, as well as the southern United States and tropical climates; notably, it can be found in Florida, Eastern North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and other moist Gulf coastal states, and along the southern Mississippi River. The cockroach can also be found in Australia, such as in warmer cities like Sydney and Brisbane. The smokybrown cockroach prefers warmer climates and is not cold-tolerant. It may, however, be able to survive colder climates by going indoors. In addition to this, it fares well in moist conditions and appears to be particularly prevalent in moist concealed areas. It often lives around the perimeter of buildings.

It replaced the old real actions and the various possessory assizes (denoting county-based pleas to local sittings of the courts) where boundary disputes often featured. Though still used in some places, the term is now obsolete in many common law jurisdictions, in which possession and title are sued by the actions of eviction (also called possession proceedings) and quiet title (or injunctive and/or declaratory relief), respectively. Originally, successful ejectment meant recovery of possession of land, for example against a defaulting tenant or a trespasser, who did not have (or no longer had) any right to remain there. It has continued to be used for this, though in some jurisdictions the terminology has changed. The old real actions, which were concerned with the title to land, were found to be too technical and difficult to use. A practice developed of trying the title to ownership of land by means of a special ejectment chiefly for ensuring a low court and had the added advantage of some confidentiality among the landed gentry. The claimant granted (or so professed) a lease to a friend which had passed to a fictitious person (such as John Doe), who became the nominal plaintiff: the real claimant (plaintiff) was thereby the \\"lessor of the plaintiff\\". The action was vicarious. The action was brought against the real defendant or, more usually, for semi-secrecy and to ensure the low court, against another fictitious person (e.g. William Styles), in many papers termed the \\"casual ejector\\", who both sides' papers would state evicted the first fictitious tenant(s) by virtue of an (equally fictitious) lease granted by the real defendant. The title of the action would then be \\"Doe dem. [name of real claimant] v. [Defendant] or [fictitous counter-tenant]\\". E.g. Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544 (England; 1822),Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe v Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544 A letter was sent in the name of the casual ejector to the real defendant, inviting him to defend the case on behalf of his supposed tenant. The defendant's right to appear depended on the existence of the fictitious lease (an existence he would willingly assert). This enabled the rights of the real parties to be litigated in a low court. Such fictitious actions have been abolished in many jurisdictions as a result of the provision of alternative remedies.

The game's story sees players controlling Frank West, a photojournalist who becomes trapped in a shopping mall within the town of Willamette, Colorado that is suffering from a zombie outbreak, and finds himself not only surviving by salvaging various items for weapons, but also rescuing survivors trapped in the complex and dealing with crazed psychopaths, while attempting to stay alive to uncover the truth behind the incident. While players must complete major missions to advance the main story, the sandbox element of the game means that optional tasks can be done, with several additional endings available if the player doesn't complete certain conditions towards the true ending of the story. Originally released for the Xbox 360 video game console on August 8, 2006, the game became a commercial success, leading it to being introduced as part of the Xbox 360 \\"Platinum Hits\\" lineup, while also spawning three sequels ‚Äì Dead Rising 2 in September 2010, Dead Rising 3 in November 2013, and Dead Rising 4 in December 2016. A remake of the game was made for the Wii, entitled Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop, and released in February 2009, with a mobile phone version also created. As part of its tenth anniversary, the game was re-released on September 13, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Gameplay West attacking zombies with a 2x4 plank. There are approx. 30 enemies onscreen Players can operate the game in one of two modes. 72 Hour Mode is the main mode and the only one available to players to begin with, in which the main objective is to investigate the Willamette Parkview Mall within 3 days, before Frank can be rescued by helicopter, completing a series of \\"Case Files\\" - major missions that, when completed, advance the game's main story. If the player fails a Case File, the game does not end, allowing the player to merely explore the mall instead until the mode is up, though failure to comply to certain conditions (primarily associated with Case Files) will result in then earning a different ending. Completing all the Case Files by the time 72 Hour Mode is over, will unlock \\"Overtime Mode\\" which players automatically begin, where the main objective to complete has Frank given one more day to complete an additional set of objectives within the mall. The second mode, ‚àû (Infinity) Mode, is unlocked after completing Overtime Mode and allows players to roam around the mall in sandbox mode without any time limit, with Frank merely trying to survive as long as possible. To survive in all modes, players need to find and seek out weapons scattered around the mall that they can use against the zombies. Over 250 items are available to use in combat; they can be found anywhere, such as in stores, and fall under two categories, melee and ranged, with all ranging from the powerful, to the near-useless. The weapons and other items are firearms, sports equipment, children's toys, furniture, construction tools, electronic devices, and various bladed objects. Frank can carry only a limited number of weapons - baseball bats, 2x4 planks, hammers, pistols, shotguns, and so forth, though he can carry multiple versions of the same type. Also, he can use them only a limited number of times before he must find new ones, as melee weapons eventually deteriorate and break, while guns must be discarded when out of ammunition. Some weapons can be changed by the environment - frying pans can be heated on a stove both to increase damage and grant access to a special move - while others are large objects that Frank cannot store in his inventory and which he will drop if he picks up or switches to another item. Many of the less useful weapons exist purely for humorous effect. For example, the toy Megabuster, from Capcom's Mega Man, shoots tennis balls; traffic cones are simply put over a zombie's head, causing it to stumble about blindly. Items other than weapons are available. Frank can try out various outfits from the mall's clothing stores - such as a Special Forces uniform, wrestling boots, a hockey mask and Mega Man X's armor. He can carry around certain books that can confer bonuses, such as increasing the durability of weapons. He can consume food and drink scavenged while exploring to recover health, or blend them together to make different \\"juices\\", which have temporary effects on the player. In Infinity Mode, players need to eat food to stay alive, as Frank's health drops every 100 seconds. They cannot access the supermarket within the mall, and food items are limited, but they can acquire weapons and food items from all characters; survivors are hostile to them in this mode. Dead Rising incorporates an element of RPGs in the form of an experience system, in which completing various actions will reward Frank with \\"Prestige Points\\" (PP). While in both modes, killing large number of zombies can earn PP, so too can taking photographs. Any photograph that Frank takes in the game is automatically scored based on five \\"genres\\" - horror (zombies and graphic gore), outtakes (humorous events or scenes), erotica (photos of female survivors or zombies, particularly those focusing on the breasts and crotch), drama (dramatic events, such as the survivors' reactions while in the security room), or brutality (deaths of zombies and other characters) - with the score converted into PP. In addition to these actions, both 72 Hour Mode and Overtime Mode award PP for completing Case Files, and completing the optional task of rescuing survivors within the mall, and defeating \\"psychopaths\\" - boss characters who have either been driven insane by the zombie attacks, or are using the outbreak as cover for their own purposes. Once enough PP is earned, Frank will level up, resulting in upgrades to either attack power, running speed, throw distance, health, or to the number of items Frank can carry in his inventory, while new moves can also be unlocked, which boost his effectiveness with hand-to-hand combat. Any experience, levels, and unlocked moves earned in a playthrough will automatically be carried over into a new game should the player choose to restart, which can make subsequent playthroughs much easier. An in-game HUD is provided, which displays information on Frank's health, his prestige level and the amount of PP progress he has made towards the next one, his inventory of weapons and their condition/amount of ammo left, a counter for the number of zombies the player has killed during a playthrough, and objective counters for both major and optional tasks, which consists of a bar that counts down the amount of time a player has to reach where the objective is located within the mall and complete it, before it is considered to be failed. Players also have access to a map to help them make their way around the mall and pinpoint where they must go in the main game mode, can receive calls on a transceiver about anything suspicious that Frank can investigate (he cannot jump, attack, switch weapons, or pick up/use any item when taking a call), and can view Frank's watch to determine what time it is; in-game time progresses faster than real time, with a day in the game taking two hours of real time, while the time of day also affects the behaviour of the zombies - during the day, they are sluggish and weak, but become more active, tougher, and more numerous at night. Players may save by using green couches or the mall's various restrooms, though the original Xbox 360 version allows only one game-in-progress save to be made per memory device and player profile; the save system is disabled for Infinity Mode. When Frank is killed, the player may reload from the last save or restart from the beginning. Plot Photojournalist Frank West is alerted by a source that something is happening in the town of Willamette, Colorado. Flying into the town with helicopter pilot Ed DeLuca, he learns that the town is subject to a military quarantine and observes several violent incidents throughout the town. He is dropped onto the Willamette Parkview Mall's helipad, after asking Ed to return in three days. Arriving in the mall, he learns that the quarantine is due to an outbreak of zombies. The mall is breached, forcing Frank to take refuge in the mall's security room. With the help of janitor Otis Washington, he travels into the mall. After helping D.H.S. agent Brad Garrison in a firefight against an unknown assailant, the two strike an alliance. Person of interest to Brad, Russell Barnaby is located by the two, hidden in a bookstore. Barnaby refuses to be escorted to safety, forcing the two to return to the security room. Unable to call for assistance due to a communications jammer, the two rescue Barnaby from the unknown assailant. Brad is injured, forcing Frank to search for medicine. In his search, he comes across a woman he met during the mall's breach. The woman rebukes him, mentioning Santa Cabeza. Frank learns from Barnaby that Santa Cabeza was ostensibly a Central American town linked to the drug trade; which distributed drugs that had a zombifying effect. Locating the woman again on security monitors, he questions her. Revealing herself to be Isabela Keyes, sister of the unknown assailant, Carlito, she promises to set up an interview between the two. Isabela comes to the meeting alone, after being shot in a rage by Carlito. Frank escorts Isabela to the security room, where she reveals that Santa Cabeza was home to an American research facility experimenting on cattle, and that Barnaby was its head. Isabela, as a research assistant, was privy to the fact that a species of native wasp was used in an attempt to boost the performance of cattle, but instead had a zombifying effect. The wasps escaped and affected humans, forcing a U.S. military cleanup of all life in the town, with few escapees. Barnaby begins to zombify and attacks Brad's partner, Jesse McCarney, and is killed. Isabela reveals that Carlito is planning to use the mall as a staging point to spread the parasites across the country, using bombs located in trucks. Brad and Frank disable the bombs. Brad and Carlito engage in a firefight, and Carlito is mortally wounded. Carlito manages to kick Brad out of the room, where he is injured by zombies off screen. Frank can find him in the tunnels, where he tells Frank not to tell Jessie, and slides his hand gun to Frank, implying that he wants Frank to shoot him. He will then fully turn. Frank locates Carlito and receives his locket, before Carlito dies. The locket causes Isabela to realise the password of Carlito's computer, allowing her to shut down the jammer. However, U.S. Special Forces arrive in the mall regardless, and have cleanup orders. Jesse is allowed to live, but she zombifies. Otis escapes with a helicopter and possible survivors that Frank rescued. Frank returns to the helipad alone, and DeLuca's helicopter arrives, but crashes into the mall's clock tower. Isabela arrives, but Frank passes out. Isabela realises that Frank has been infected by the wasp larval parasite. Frank gathers supplies for a drug that can suppress the parasite, and discovers an exit from the mall created by DeLuca's crash. Isabela learns from Carlito's computer that he has manufactured the drug before, and used it on fifty infected orphans, spreading them across the country. After exiting the mall, Frank encounters the cleanup operation's commander, Brock Mason, who also commanded Santa Cabeza's operation. The two fight, until Mason is knocked into a crowd of zombies. Frank and Isabela escape from Willamette, but Isabela is taken into custody as a perpetrator of the incident. Frank manages to report on the incident and Santa Cabeza, but the truth of Carlito's orphans remain unknown. =Other endings= Although completing all Case Files and Overtime Mode leads to the game's canonical ending, in terms of the game's lore, the player may encounter different endings in Dead Rising, depending on certain actions that they perform, as listed below: * Ending B: Be at the helipad when time expires, but don't complete all Case Files - Frank returns for his pickup by Ed, and convinces him to airlift the survivors he rescued out of the mall (Ed's dialogue will vary depending on how many survivors the player has rescued). An epilogue reveals that the cause of the outbreak remained unknown, and that other outbreaks shortly occurred within other cities in the United States. * Ending C: Complete all Case Files, but do not talk to Isabella at 10am on the third day - Frank fails to appear on the rooftop helipad, much to Ed's disappointment. Ed, watching from another rooftop through binoculars, is killed by a zombie. An epilogue reveals that Willamette was quarantined because of an unspecified disease, though with no one able to contradict this with the true story. * Ending D: Be captured by the Special Forces, and don't escape when time expires - Frank is taken away in a military helicopter by Special Forces. An epilogue reveals that the military's presence was later revealed in a cover-up story, which cited they were there to clean up a series of incidents in Willamette, though no disclosure is given to what these were. * Ending E: Fail to complete all the Case Files and don't be on the helipad when time expires - Ed lands to await for Frank's arrival, but is about to leave when he fails to show up, only to spot Otis open the roof access door and step out alongside Jessie, and any survivors who Frank had rescued, leading Ed to transporting them to safety. An epilogue reveals the survivors credited Frank for saving them, but that his whereabouts remain unknown. * Ending F: Fail to gather all of Carlito's bombs in time - A bomb's timer counts down to zero before a white-out follows, and a photo is shown of an explosion occurring within the mall. An epilogue reveals that Carlito's plan with the explosives was successful, effectively leading the United States to suffer under a widespread zombie pandemic a few days later. * Fail to complete Overtime Mode before time expires - Frank eventually succumbs to his infection and transforms into a zombie. An epilogue states that his undead condition brought about a \\"humane\\" end to his hopeless situation. Characters Development Promotion at E3 2006 Much of the game's inspiration came from the zombie films of the 1960s and 1970s, especially those of George A. Romero. Despite the game's similarities to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, Capcom asserted that the concept of \\"humans battling zombies in a shopping mall\\" is a \\"wholly unprotectible idea\\" under the present copyright laws. While the company wanted to have the game follow on from its other zombie-centered game series, its development team opted to design the game with a more comical view of zombies in the horror genre, particularly in the way that players interacted with the zombies in the game, allowing them to be able to do anything against them in terms of what weapons they could use against them, while they also based the mall upon the stereotypical design of American shopping malls. One particular area that was keenly worked on by the team was the number of zombies that could appear onscreen during the game in order to give the feel that it was a major outbreak; when Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed the game, they reported that up to 800 zombies could appear on screen at once. As the development team consisted of members who had worked on Capcom's role-playing video game Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, it helped greatly in incorporating one of the game's elements borrowed from it, towards the developing the mechanics structure of Dead Rising - the ability to roll over anything earned in terms of experience, levels and abilities, towards making a new playthrough, was implemented so that players would have a sense of responsibility for their decisions and actions. After making changes to the beta of the game, a playable demo was released via the Xbox Live Marketplace on August 4, 2006, prior to its release over the next two months. =Soundtrack= Dead Rising Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on March 30, 2007 in a 2,000-copy limited edition, bundled with a T-shirt. It was packaged with a T-shirt that showcased Frank, Isabella, and an outline of the mall. A non-limited edition of the same soundtrack was released on June 20, 2007. =Downloadable content= Soon after Dead Rising was released in the United States, Capcom released nine downloadable \\"keys\\" to Xbox Live Marketplace that would unlock different lockers in the Security Room, providing the player with nine new outfit options, adding three more keys for players to download and use on May 31, 2007. Reception Dead Rising received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with most reviewers commending the \\"sandbox\\"-style of gameplay, the amount to explore within the mall, and the sheer number of ways to kill the thousands of zombies, with GameSpot stating it was \\"a great piece of entertainment\\", while two reviewers on Australian video game talk show Good Game gave the title a 6-7/10 score. However, general consensus amongst reviews was towards criticising the game's save system mechanic and the AI of the survivors; while IGN considered the game to be \\"one of the more unique and entertaining titles on the Xbox 360\\", its review notably indicated that improvements were needed with both the save system and NPCs, along with offering \\"a more forgiving story progression, and tighter controls\\". One point of contention in reviews was the operation of the game's transceiver, specifically on how persistent it is when ringing, how vulnerable Frank is while answering any calls on it, and how if the telephone call is somehow interrupted (such as being attacked), it would end abruptly and be repeated again when the player answers the transceiver a few seconds later and hears Frank being scolded by Otis for disrupting him; the use of the transceiver in the game led to numerous gamer-oriented webcomics and blogs parodying the use of it. Despite this, Capcom reported around 500,000 copies had been shipped out in the first month after its release, and one million copies worldwide by the end of 2006. It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. One notable complaint that Dead Rising received, was from players who ran the game through either a standard- definition or small high-definition set, only to find themselves having difficulty reading the on-screen text, an issue caused due to Capcom deciding to develop the game exclusively for high-definition televisions, particularly as it had been touted as one of the first truly \\"next generation\\" titles available for the Xbox 360. In response to the complaints about the issue, a representative of the company posted the following on Xbox.com: A week later, Capcom released a statement saying they would not be fixing the problem, and suggested some DIY solutions to resolve the issue. =Awards= Along with being ranked #2 in gaming magazine Gamesmaster's Top 50 of 2006, Dead Rising won several awards: * IGN awarded the title \\"Most Innovative Design for Xbox 360\\" in its Best of 2006. * GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2006 awarded the game with the honors of \\"Best Action Adventure Game\\", \\"Best Sound Effects\\",GameSpot.com ‚Äì Best of 2006 and \\"Best Use of Xbox 360 Achievement Points\\".GameSpot.com ‚Äì Best of 2006 * The 2006 Spike TV Video Game Awards awarded it with \\"Game of the Year\\". * X-Play awarded it with \\"Best Original Game\\" of 2006. =Reaction in Germany= Because of the graphical nature of the violence portrayed in Dead Rising, the BPjM in Germany felt that game fulfilled at least one of their indexing criteria, documenting that the title glorified violence. As a direct result, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle, the board responsible for rating entertainment software for Germany, refused to rate the game, and effectively put a halt to Microsoft publishing a German version, as the company does not allow unrated games to be released for the Xbox 360, though the game was made available for import to players of a legal age. However, after a decision by Hamburg's county court in June 2007, it was prohibited within the country from late August 2007, making sales of the title illegal in Germany; anyone caught selling the game would be sentenced to imprisonment or a monetary penalty according to ¬ß131 of the German criminal code, with all copies confiscated by the German police.Dead Rising - Beschlagnahmung offiziell best√§tigt auf Xbox360Welt.com - Das inoffizielle Xbox 360 Magazin =Legal issues= The MKR Group, who holds the copyright to both the 1978 Dawn of the Dead film and its 2004 remake, sent letters on February 6, 2008 to Capcom, Microsoft, and Best Buy, claiming that Dead Rising infringes on the copyrights and trademarks of these films. In a complaint filed February 12, 2008, to seek an injunction that would pre- emptively counter an anticipated complaint from MKR, Capcom asserted that \\"humans battling zombies in a shopping mall\\" is a \\"wholly unprotectable idea\\" under today's copyright laws; Capcom further pointed to the warning \\"label\\" on the box cover as a preemptive measure that was intended to separate the game from the films and avoid any customer confusion. The MKR Group subsequently filed a lawsuit in February 2008 after failing to reach an agreement with Capcom over the dispute. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008, with United States Magistrate Judge Richard G. Seeborg stating that MKR failed to demonstrate the similarity of any protected element of Dawn of the Dead to that of Dead Rising, with many of the elements MKR claimed were similar being part of the \\"wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak\\". Legacy =Wii version= A remake of Dead Rising was released for the Wii in February 2009, titled Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop, and was developed by Capcom and published by THQ in Australia. Built upon the same engine used for the Wii version of Resident Evil 4, which had been positively received by reviewers, the remake incorporated additional features to that of the Xbox 360 original, including the use of an over-the- shoulder camera approach and utilising the motion control system of the Wii Remote, yet lacked some of the features of the original, including showing large number of zombies on screen and the photography system. The Wii version ultimately earned mixed reviews, though was praised for having an improved aiming system to that of the original. =Hand-held versions= In 2008, Capcom Interactive Canada released a hand-held spin-off of the game for mobile phone, announcing on 4 October 2010 that an iOS version of the game was also announced. In this version, players have access to a new game mechanic in which they can call upon their friends via Twitter and Facebook to help revive them, with their refusal causing them to appear as a zombie within their friend's game, while complex operations in the game are performed through context-based buttons. Similar to Infinity Mode in the console version, the game features a hunger meter, with Frank now required to eat food within the mall in order to survive. The hand-held spin-off was generally well received by reviewers, earning a B+ from 1UP.com, and a 7.3/10 from IGN, with praise given for staying true to the sandbox design and plot of the Xbox 360 version, despite being pared down for the smaller screen and platform. =Remastered version= On 18 July 2016, Capcom announced that work was underway for a remastered version of the original Dead Rising, alongside its sequel Dead Rising 2 and its spin-off title, aiming for these to be released for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, prior to the release of the fourth game in the series. These were released on 13 September that year, both separately and in a bundle pack, with the developers improving the game's graphics to high- definition and increasing the number of save slots and the improving the frame-rate. =Sequels= Following the game's commercial success, plans were made to create a sequel, with it aimed to operate on multiple platforms. On 28 September 2010, Dead Rising 2 was released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows, and while it followed the basic setup of gameplay mechanics as the original, it featured a new character, a currency system, a weapon creation system that involved finding \\"Combo Cards\\" to know what to make, and online multiplayer modes, including zombie-killing minigames and two-player cooperative play, whilst also featuring improvements to address some of the negative feedback that Dead Rising received. Since its release, two downloadable episodes were released for the game - one a prologue set before the main story of Dead Rising 2, the other taking place after it and featuring Frank West, who is also controllable in it - and a re-imagined version was released in October 2011, with a new story and Frank West being the main protagonist. The game eventually spawned two more sequels, developed by Capcom's Canadian branch, Capcom Vancouver - Dead Rising 3 was released on 22 November 2013 for Xbox One and on 5 September 2014 for Microsoft Windows, while Dead Rising 4 was released on 6 December 2016. Capcom Vancouver was also developing a Dead Rising 5, which was cancelled when the studio closed down in September 2018.

He can be considered part of the Venetian school, though he was also influenced by Antonello da Messina, in the emphasis he gives to landscape backgrounds and the tranquil atmosphere of his works. Once formed his style did not change greatly. He mostly painted religious subjects, often on a small scale for homes rather than churches, but also a few, mostly small, mythological ones. He often repeated popular subjects in different versions with slight variations, including his Madonnas and Saint Jerome in a Landscape. His paintings of the Madonna and Child include several variations of a composition that have a standing infant Jesus, which in turn are repeated several times. Biography Nicodemus with Christ's body, the Apostle John on the right and Mary to left. Giovanni Battista Cima was born at Conegliano, then part of the terrafirma of the Republic of Venice but now part of the province of Treviso, in 1459 or 1460. His father, who died in 1484, was a cloth-shearer (cimator), hence the family surname. Catholic Encyclopedia 1913 In 1488 the young painter was at work at Vicenza; in 1492 he established himself at Venice, but by the summer of 1516 he had returned to his native place. Cima married twice, his first wife, Corona, bore him two sons, the older of whom took Holy orders at Padua. By Joanna, his second wife, he had six children, three being daughters. His oldest painting inscribed with a date is the Madonna of the Arbour (1489; now in Museum of Vicenza). This picture is done in distemper and savours so much of the style of Bartolomeo Montagna, who lived at Vicenza from 1480, as to make it highly probable that Cima was his pupil. Even in this early production Cima gave evidence of the serious calm, and almost passionless spirit that so eminently characterized him. Later he fell under the influence of Giovanni Bellini and became one of his ablest successors, forming a happy, if not indispensable link between this master and Titian. According to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: > At first his figures were somewhat crude, but they gradually lost their > harshness and gained in grace while still preserving the dignity. In the > background of his facile, harmonious compositions the mountains of his > country are invested with new importance. Cima was one of the first Italians > to assign a place for landscape depiction, and to formulate the laws of > atmosphere and of the distribution of light and shade. His Baptism of Christ > in the church of San Giovanni in Bragora, in Venice (1492), gives striking > evidence of this. The colouring is rich and right with a certain silvery > tone peculiar to Cima, but which in his later works merges into a delicate > gold. His conceptions are usually calm and undramatic, and he has painted > scarcely any scenes (having depicted religious ones almost exclusively) that > are not suggestive of \\"sante conversazioni\\". His Incredulity of St. Thomas > (National Gallery, London) and his beautiful Nativity (Venice, Santa Maria > dei Carmini, 1509) are hardly aught else. But most of his paintings > represent Madonnas enthroned among the elect, and in these subjects he > observes a gently animated symmetry. The groupings of these sainted figures, > even though they may not have a definitely pious character, and the > impression of unspeakable peace. Among his pupils were his son, Carlo da Conegliano, and Vittore Belliniano. It is unclear if Francesco Beccaruzzi, who was born in Conegliano in 1492, received direct training from Cima.

He was a son of Sarah Abagail (n√©e Rodman) Woodward (1840‚Äì1913) and William Woodward Jr. (1836‚Äì1889), who came from a prominent and wealthy Maryland family that dated back to colonial times. The family made their fortune in selling textiles to the Confederate government, and his father was the founder of the New York Cotton Exchange. He was educated at the Cutler School in New York before preparing at Groton. He attended Harvard University, graduating in 1898, followed by Harvard Law School, where he graduated in 1901. In 1901, he was admitted to the bar. Career For the next two years Woodward lived in London where he served as secretary to the United States Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Hodges Choate. There, he joined with other members of the political and economic elite including King Edward VII, at fashionable events including thoroughbred horse races, the favorite pastime of English royalty and nobility. Upon his return to New York in 1903, Woodward was made vice president of Hanover National Bank in New York City by his uncle, James T. Woodward, who was then president of the bank. Woodward's grandfather had helped James purchase a large portion of the bank years earlier before his death, which the younger Woodward inherited, therefore owning a controlling interest in the bank. Following his uncle's death, William Woodward Sr. became president of the bank in 1910, serving in that capacity until a 1929 merger with the Central Union Trust Company when he was appointed chairman of the new corporate entity called Central Hanover Bank & Trust, and Central's president, George W. Davison, became president of the new entity. Woodward served as chairman of the board from 1929 until his retirement in 1933. Woodward was one of the original directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1914 and from 1927 to 1929, he was president of the New York Clearing House. =Belair and thoroughbred racing= Belair Mansion Woodward also inherited the historic Belair Mansion and 2,500 acre Stud in Collington, Maryland. Belair is a very historic estate where Colonial Governor of Maryland Samuel Ogle had brought the first Thoroughbred horses imported to America from England in 1747. His uncle James had acquired it in 1898 for an undisclosed sum of money. Upon inheriting the property, Woodward built the Belair Stud into one of the dominant breeding and thoroughbred horse racing operations in the United States during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. In 1925, Woodward joined Arthur B. Hancock, Marshall Field III and Robert A. Fairbairn to import the stallion Sir Gallahad III into the United States to stand at Claiborne Farm. Sir Gallahad III would become a four-time leading sire in North America and would sire 60 stakes winners, including nine for Woodward. Sir Gallahad III's most famous offspring was Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox, who would in turn sire Triple Crown winner Omaha, both bred and raced by Woodward. Horses bred by Belair won every major stakes race in the U.S. as well as The Oaks, St. Leger Stakes, 1,000 Guineas, and other important races in Britain. Woodward's accomplishments in horse racing led to him making the August 7, 1939 cover of Time magazine. Woodward was elected to the United States Jockey Club in 1917 and served as its chairman from 1930 until 1950. One of the main efforts he pursued was the repeal of the Jersey Act, a regulation of the British Thoroughbred stud book that prevented most American-bred Thoroughbreds from being registered in the United Kingdom as purebred Thoroughbreds. In 1950, Woodward was elected an honorary member of the British Jockey Club. Personal life In 1903, Woodward met Elsie Ogden Cryder (1882‚Äì1981) at Saratoga, New York, a daughter of tea importer Duncan Cryder and Elizabeth Callender (n√©e Ogden) Cryder and one of the \\"famous Cryder triplets\\". They were married at Grace Church in New York on October 24, 1904. Elsie's younger sister Edith was the wife of Frederick Lothrop Ames Jr. and her aunt, the former Mary Hone Ogden, was the wife of Charles Francis Adams Jr. (the grandson of president John Quincy Adams). Together, they were the parents of one son and four daughters, including: * Edith Woodward (1905‚Äì1971), who married Thomas Moore Bancroft in 1929. * Elizabeth Ogden Woodward (1907‚Äì1986), who married Robert Livingston Stevens (1907‚Äì1972) in 1928. They divorced in 1935, and she married John Teele Pratt Jr., a son of John Teele Pratt, in 1935. After his death in 1969, she married Squaw Valley Ski Resort founder Alexander Cochrane Cushing in 1971. * Sarah Woodward (1910‚Äì1991), who married Charles Arthur Moore III (1909‚Äì1989) in 1936. They divorced and she married Marshall Christopher Sewall (1908‚Äì1983) in 1949. * Ethel Woodward (b. 1914), who married Philippe de Croisset (1912‚Äì1965), a son of French playwright Francis de Croisset, in 1941. His nephew was Count Philippe de Montebello and his sister was Marie-Laure, Vicomtesse de Noailles. After having two sons, Ethel and Philippe divorced and he married Jacqueline de la Chaume (after his death in 1965, Jacqueline became the third wife of actor Yul Brynner). * William Woodward Jr. (1920‚Äì1955), who married Ann Crowell in 1943‚Å†. In 1955 Ann shot and killed William, reportedly thinking him a burglar. She later committed suicide in 1975, after Truman Capote published a story that \\"depicted her as a murderous vamp.\\" In 1908, they lived at 11 West 51st Street in New York City and had a summer home in Mount Kisco, New York. Around 1910, they purchased The Cloisters on Ochre Point in Newport, Rhode Island, the former estate of Catherine Lorillard Kernochan, which had been designed by architect J.D. Johnston around 1885. The Woodwards hired New York architects Delano & Aldrich to complete a major renovation, which was completed by 1914. The home was torn down in 1950 and the site was divided into smaller parcels for contemporary homes. The family also relocated from their 51st Street residence to 9 East 86th Street, which Woodward had purchased for $200,000 from William E. Iselin in 1916 and, again, hired architects Delano & Aldrich to design and build him a residence. Woodward died on September 25, 1953, aged 77, at his home in Manhattan. After a funeral at St. James Episcopal Church in Manhattan, he was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx. He left the estate to his son, William Woodward Jr., whose untimely death two years later in 1955 saw the end of Belair Stud. His widow, considered \\"one of the last grandes dames of New York society\\", died in her apartment at The Waldorf Towers, where she had lived since 1956, in 1981. =Legacy= Today the Belair Stable Museum in Bowie, Maryland, highlights the work of William Woodward Sr. and others connected to the Belair Stud. The Woodward Stakes, a Grade I event now run at Saratoga, is named in his honor. In 2016, Woodward was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame as a Pillar of the Turf.

As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture.Kruft, Hanno-Walter. A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present (New York, Princeton Architectural Press: 1994). It contains a variety of information on Greek and Roman buildings, as well as prescriptions for the planning and design of military camps, cities, and structures both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments).Vitruvius. Ten Books on Architecture, Ed. Ingrid Rowland with illustrations by Thomas Noble Howe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1999) Since Vitruvius published before the development of cross vaulting, domes, concrete, and other innovations associated with Imperial Roman architecture, his ten books give no information on these hallmarks of Roman building design and technology.See William L. MacDonald, The Architecture of the Roman Empire: An Introductory Study (New Haven, Yale University Press: 1982): 10-11. Origin and contents Probably written between 30 and 15 BC, it combines the knowledge and views of many antique writers, Greek and Roman, on architecture, the arts, natural history and building technology. Vitruvius cites many authorities throughout the text, often praising Greek architects for their development of temple building and the orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), and providing key accounts of the origins of building in the primitive hut. Though often cited for his famous \\"triad\\" of characteristics associated with architecture - utilitas, firmitas and venustas (utility, strength and beauty) - the aesthetic principles that influenced later treatise writers were outlined in Book III. Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so. The Roman author gives advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.Vitruvius: On Architecture, Book I, edited and translated into English by Frank Granger (Cambridge, Harvard University Press: 1931-34). The ten books or scrolls are organized as follows: ‚Äì Ten Books on Architecture Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in . He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings. Vitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book of , he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre- Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book relates the abstract geometry of Plato to the everyday work of the surveyor. Astrology is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while astronomy is required for the understanding of sundials. Likewise, Vitruvius cites Ctesibius of Alexandria and Archimedes for their inventions, Aristoxenus (Aristotle's apprentice) for music, Agatharchus for theatre, and Varro for architecture. =Buildings= Greek house plan by Vitruvius Vitruvius sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the artist's work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from is one still quoted by architects: Well [meaning good] building hath [has] three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight. This quote is taken from Sir Henry Wotton's version of 1624, and accurately translates the passage in the work (I.iii.2): but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word \\"commodity\\", and the tag is usually misunderstood. In modern English: \\"The ideal building has three elements; it is sturdy, useful, and beautiful.\\" Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book ) and this part of his were later adopted and adapted in the famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci (, \\"Vitruvian Man\\"). = Domestic architecture = While Vitruvius is fulsome in his descriptions of religious buildings, infrastructure and machinery, he gives a mixed message on domestic architecture. Similar to Aristotle, Vitruvius offers admiration for householders who built their own homes without the involvement of an architect. Vitruvius‚Äôs ambivalence on domestic architecture is most clearly read in the opening paragraph of the Introduction to Book 6. Book 6 focusses exclusively on residential architecture but as architectural theorist Simon Weir has explained, instead of writing the introduction on the virtues of residences or the family or some theme related directly to domestic life; Vitruvius writes an anecdote about the Greek ethical principle of Xenia: showing kindness to strangers. Roman technology A Roman Ballista The Pont du Gard Roman aqueduct in southern France. is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures, such as hoists, cranes, and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, ballistae, and siege engines. Vitruvius also described the construction of sundials and water clocks, and the use of an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind). =Aqueducts and mills= Books , , and of form the basis of much of what is known about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the in southern France. Numerous such massive structures occur across the former empire, a testament to the power of Roman engineering. Vitruvius's description of Roman aqueduct construction is short, but mentions key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed. His book would have been of assistance to Frontinus, a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome. Frontinus wrote , the definitive treatise on 1st-century Roman aqueducts, and discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. The Roman Empire went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no fewer than 16 water mills at Barbegal in France demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known, such as the much later Hierapolis sawmill. =Materials= Vitruvius described many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as stucco painting. Cement, concrete, and lime received in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design. He advised that lead should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred. He comes to this conclusion in Book of after empirical observation of the apparent laborer illnesses in the (lead pipe) foundries of his time. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, soon coating the inner surfaces of the pipes, so lead poisoning was reduced. Design for an Archimedean water-screw Vitruvius related the famous story about Archimedes and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realized the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of , and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure gold. He showed the crown had been alloyed with silver, and the king was defrauded. =Dewatering machines= Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines Rio Tinto Vitruvius described the construction of the Archimedes' screw in Chapter 10, although did not mention Archimedes by name. It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines mentioned in include the endless chain of buckets and the reverse overshot water-wheel. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at Rio Tinto in Spain and Dolaucothi in west Wales. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the British Museum, and one from the latter in the National Museum of Wales. The remains were discovered when these mines were reopened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as water wheels to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, fulling, and so on. =Force pump= Ctesibius is credited with the invention of the force pump, which Vitruvius described as being built from bronze with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by Hero of Alexandria in his . The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentioned its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire engine. One was found at (Roman Silchester) in England, and another is on display at the British Museum. Their functions are not described, but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specified. Vitruvius also mentioned the several automatons Ctesibius invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function. =Central heating= Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa: The part under the is covered. Vitruvius outlined the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the hypocaust, a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so fuel efficiency is maximized; for example, the is next to the followed by the . He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger , such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Caracalla. =Surveying instruments= That Vitruvius must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or , which he compared favourably with the , a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He described the , in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the Peutinger Table. =Sea level change= In Book Chapter 1 Subsection 4 of is a description of 13 Athenian cities in Asia Minor, \\"the land of Caria\\", in present-day Turkey. These cities are given as: Ephesus, Miletus, Myus, Priene, Samos, Teos, Colophon, Chius, Erythrae, Phocaea, Clazomenae, Lebedos, Mytilene, and later a 14th, Smyrnaeans. Myus, the third city, is described as being \\"long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage\\". This sentence indicates, at the time of Vitruvius's writing, it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from south to north so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case, then since the writing of , the region has experienced either soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, or speculation of such, during the later-empire many Roman ports suffered from what contemporary writers described as 'silting'. The constant need to dredge ports became a heavy burden on the treasury and some have speculated that this expense significantly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire. Roman salt works in Essex, England, today are located at the five-metre contour, implying this was the coastline. These observations only indicate the extent of silting and soil rebound affecting coastline change since the writing of . Survival and rediscovery Vitruvius's work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace of Charlemagne in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical manuscripts is part of what is called the Carolingian Renaissance.) Many of Vitruvius's surviving works derive from an extant manuscript rewritten there, British Library manuscript Harley 2767. These texts were not just copied, but also known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, bishop Einhard, asked the visiting English churchman Alcuin for explanations of some technical terms. In addition, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, including: Vussin, Hrabanus Maurus, Hermann of Reichenau, Hugo of St. Victor, Gervase of Melkey, William of Malmesbury, Theoderich of St. Trond, Petrus Diaconus, Albertus Magnus, Filippo Villani, Jean de Montreuil, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Giovanni de Dondi, Domenico di Bandino, Niccol√≤ Acciaioli bequeathed copy to the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence, Bernward of Hildesheim, and St. Thomas Aquinas. In 1244 the Dominican friar Vincent of Beauvais made a large number of references to in his compendium of all the knowledge of the Middle Ages Many copies of , dating from the 8th to the 15th centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the Middle Ages and 92 are still available in public collections, but they appear to have received little attention, possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius and the loss of most of the original 10 illustrations thought by some to be helpful in understanding parts of the text. Vitruvius's work was \\"rediscovered\\" in 1414 by the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini, who found it in the Abbey library of Saint Gall, Switzerland. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of Renaissance thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving. Vitruvian Man, illustration in the edition of by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521) The first printed edition (), an version, was published by the Veronese scholar Fra Giovanni Sulpitius in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496), but none were illustrated. The Dominican friar Fra Giovanni Giocondo produced the first version illustrated with woodcuts in Venice in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations. Translations into Italian were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by Cesare Cesariano, a Milanese friend of the architect Bramante, printed in Como in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languagesthe first German version was published in 1528and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by Claude Perrault, commissioned by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1664. John Shute had drawn on the text as early as 1563 for his book The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture. Sir Henry Wotton's 1624 work The Elements of Architecture amounts to a heavily-influenced adaptation, while a 1692 translation was much abridged. English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius's work had become a popular subject of hermeneutics, with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed. Impact Vitruvian Man, Leonardo da Vinci, (c. 1485-1490) The rediscovery of Vitruvius's work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance, prompting the rebirth of Classical architecture in subsequent centuries. Renaissance architects, such as Niccoli, Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, found in their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline as well as emphasising the skills of the artisan. One of Leonardo da Vinci's best known drawings, the Vitruvian Man, is based on the principles of body proportions developed by Vitruvius in the first chapter of Book III, On Symmetry: In Temples And In The Human Body. The English architect Inigo Jones and the Frenchman Salomon de Caus were among the first to re- evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and sciences based upon number and proportion. The 16th-century architect Palladio considered Vitruvius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on his work before conceiving his own architectural precepts. =Astrolabe= The earliest evidence of use of the stereographic projection in a machine is in , which describes an anaphoric clock (it is presumed, a or water clock) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the 1st to 3rd centuries have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were, it is presumed, fairly widespread among Romans.

Their musical style has been variously described as psychobilly, Southern rock, hard rock, and cowpunk, as well as sleaze rock. The band's lyrical themes mostly revolve around sex, drugs, drinking, fighting, and rock 'n' roll. Initially called Hell's Half-Acre, the band's name comes from Ted Nugent's introduction to \\"Wang Dang Sweet Poontang\\" on the Double Live Gonzo album.Index 1:00‚Äì1:04: \\"This is a love song; I'd like to dedicate this to all that Nashville pussy.\\" Following the initial 1997 breakup of Kentucky cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer, guitarist Blaine Cartwright formed Nashville Pussy where he would take up vocal duties in addition to guitar. The core lineup of Nashville Pussy consists of husband-and-wife duo Blaine Cartwright and Ruyter Suys (pronounced \\"Rider Sighs\\"), and drummer Jeremy Thompson, formerly of Texas band Phantom Creeps. Original drummer Adam Neal (Nine Pound Hammer) left to form the Hookers. Original bassist Corey Parks (sister of former basketball player Cherokee Parks) quit one month after the release of the album High as Hell, and later joined Die Hunns. Tracy Almazan a.k.a. Tracy Kickass formerly of New York City's The Wives, and Helldorado was enlisted to replace Parks mid-tour. Nashville Pussy recorded Say Something Nasty with Almazan on bass only to be replaced by Katielyn Campbell (of the band Famous Monsters). Katie Lynn's image is on the album Say Something Nasty. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Karen Cuda for the album Get Some. Karen Cuda also appeared as bassist on the album \\"From Hell to Texas\\", and in the live DVD Live in Hollywood. Nashville Pussy have released six full-length studio albums, one EP and two live DVDs. Following The band has remained largely underground, but has been gaining a large cult following in the rock club scene, and in Europe,Portuguese news story Australia, Japan, and the rest of the world. Grassroots promotion of the band has been aided by their taper-friendly show recording policy. Ruyter Suys was recently voted One of the Greatest Female Electric Guitarists in ELLE magazine. Nine Pound Hammer has since reunited and plays the introduction song for the Adult Swim cartoon 12 Oz. Mouse. Cartwright also had a cameo in the Mr. Show spinoff movie Run Ronnie Run as Duke's Bar Owner. The band also played themselves in the Dutch Film 'Wilde Mossels' (Wild Mussels). Nashville Pussy received a Best Metal Performance Grammy nomination for their song \\"Fried Chicken And Coffee\\" from their debut release, Let Them Eat Pussy (1998, The Enclave) 1999 Grammy. Between April 2 to May 7, 1999, the band toured as the opening act for the North American leg of Marilyn Manson's Rock Is Dead Tour. Ruyter Suys was featured on National Enquirer TV along with Jennifer Lopez on the Grammy Red Carpet for her 'revealing' Evel Knievel meets Wonder Woman leather bustier in a feature titled 'Too Much Too Little'Rock On The Net Awards and their songs \\"Come On, Come On\\" and \\"Hate & Whisky\\" were featured in the video game Jackass the Game. Additionally, \\"Snake Eyes\\" was for the end credits in the video game Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012 and both \\"Shoot First and Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Wrong Side of a Gun\\" were in the movie Super Troopers. The song 'DRIVE' with its Gary Glitter style drum beat was featured in the episode 'Watching Too Much Television' of the HBO series The Sopranos. HBO'S Entourage also featured Nashville Pussy's 'Hell Ain't What It Used to Be' in the episode 'A Day in the Valley'.

In the early months of the year 2000, while serving as a long-time senior lawyer for the California Department of Insurance (CDI), Ossias leaked confidential documents exposing the allegedly illegal and corrupt activities of Chuck Quackenbush, then Insurance Commissioner of California and head of CDI, to the state legislative consultant investigating the Commissioner's actions. In 2004, Ossias also took a seat as Director for California government watchdog group Californians Aware. Education and early career In 1983, Ossias graduated from Golden Gate University School of Law. She practiced criminal defense and family law in San Francisco as a sole practitioner before entering public service as a staff attorney in 1986 at the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. Ossias joined the CDI in January 1990. In 1991, she was appointed by then-Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi to a special task force that wrote the state's regulations governing unfair claims practices by insurance companies. During her tenure at the agency, Ossias served as project manager and lead counsel for CDI's activities following various natural catastrophes, including the Oakland firestorm of 1991, the Southern California wildfires of 1993, and the Northridge earthquake of 1994. She also acted as lead counsel and project manager in disciplinary cases against large insurance companies such as Allstate Insurance, State Farm Insurance, Mercury Insurance Group, UnumProvident Insurance Group (now Unum), and HealthMarkets, Inc. (an insurance holding company). Insurance industry corruption whistleblower In early 2000, Ossias photocopied confidential CDI documents, supplied them to the California State Assembly Insurance oversight committee, and disclosed that fact to the California Highway Patrol. In testimony before the State Assembly committee (which provided her with complete immunity from criminal prosecution), Ossias detailed how CDI's upper management had suppressed findings of insurer wrongdoing after the Northridge earthquake of 1994 and instructed her to shred documents. The reports detailed claims-handling violations by State Farm, Allstate, and 20th Century Insurance, used by Quackenbush to reach settlements with those insurers requiring them to contribute millions of dollars to foundations created by the commissioner. In return, Quackenbush agreed not to fine the companies or to finalize the reports, allowing the firms to donate $12.8 million to private foundations he had created, in lieu of fines of up to $3 billion ‚Äì the amount recommended by staff based on the egregious findings contained in the confidential documents Ossias felt compelled to disclose to the legislative oversight committee, in fact the very reports that upper CDI management had suppressed. In exposing the corruption within the California Department of Insurance, Ossias risked losing her long-held CDI position, her license to practice law, and her very liberty. Ossias had uncovered evidence of corruption while heading a team of staff lawyers reviewing the insurance company files reflecting claims handling practices following the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Another aspect of the scandal was uncovered during the California Senate Insurance oversight committee's investigation: this involved a scheme whereby fraudulent other settlements were entered into between the CDI and insurers who had committed unfair claim and business practices, and these and the earthquake settlement monies were placed in foundations created by Quackenbush and top aides in order to fund projects for personal financial gain and political advancement. Quackenbush was once considered the most promising Republican candidate for the next Governor‚Äôs race, before Ossias came forward to reveal CDI corruption. According to testimony by CDI employees, including Ossias, and Assistant Chief Counsel Robert Hagedorn, the commissioner and his top aides abused their positions for personal gain and acted against consumers‚Äô interests for many years. Aftermath Quackenbush resigned from office shortly after Ossias testified before the Legislature. He was never charged, although his Deputy Commissioner was charged with and pleaded guilty to having accepted kickbacks from contributions made from the insurance foundations set up by Quackenbush. Two others were indicted in the same scheme. In the wake of Ossias' whistleblowing, a measure was passed (AB 363) permitting lawyers representing governmental clients at any level to report crimes and fraud to law enforcement or to government oversight bodies \\"in order to prevent or rectify substantial harm to the public.\\" That bill was vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis. A subsequent similar measure passed and was vetoed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Subsequent career Following the Quackenbush events and the term of the acting commissioner (during which period Ossias was assigned only minor cases, thereby appeasing insurers allegedly lobbying for her termination), John Garamendi was reelected Insurance Commissioner. Under Garamendi, Ossias served as lead counsel/project manager in CDI's case involving the claims and business practices of the nation's largest disability income insurance holding company, UnumProvident Corp. The investigation concluded with a settlement with UnumProvident, in which the company paid an $8 million fine, agreed to make substantial changes to their disability income insurance policies sold in California to make them more favorable to their insureds, and agreed to reassess claims that had been denied or terminated between 1997 and 2005. The company also agreed to provide an independent third party review to those claimants not satisfied with the company's reassessment. Some sources indicated that Ossias considered running for Insurance Commissioner in 2006 as a Democrat. However, she did not run, and Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante defeated Kraft Foods heir John Kraft for the Democratic nomination. Bustamante, in turn, lost to Republican businessman Steve Poizner.

Although born in Edinburg, Mulaik lived in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1939 to 1966. For the last 42 years, he has lived in or around the Atlanta, Georgia area. He has two sons who live with their families in the Atlanta area. Biography Mulaik began his education in 1940 at the Kindergarten at the Stewart School, the training school for teachers at the University of Utah. He proceeded through the elementary grades to \\"graduate\\" from the 9th grade in 1950. That fall he began high school at East High School in Salt Lake City. At the end of his junior year he applied and was accepted to be a Ford Scholar in a special program at the University of Utah financed by the Ford Foundation that took exceptional students at the end of their junior year in high school and admitted them to the University of Utah as freshman to see if they could handle university level courses. Students in this program performed exceptionally and a major portion of Mulaik's class of Ford Scholars later obtained Ph.D.'s in various subjects. Mulaik also entered the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University and at graduation received a commission of 2nd lieutenant in the Army. He received training in artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas and served in a field artillery battalion in the United States Army Reserve until 1963, and then joined a research and development unit with assignments to The Pentagon until 1970, when he went inactive as a captain. Education Mulaik obtained his B.S. (biology and secondary education, 1956), M.A. (psychology, 1962) and Ph.D. (clinical psychology, 1963) from the University of Utah. Academic career From 1964 to 1966 he was a research associate with Dr. Calvin W. Taylor (his dissertation chairman) and his wife to be Jane Stacy on a grant titled Measurement and Prediction of Nursing Performance. Working on this project he learned FORTRAN programming and wrote a factor analysis program to conduct analysis of the project's data. He married the co-principal investigator, Jane Stacy, in 1963, and they had two sons, Stephen and Robert. In 1966 he obtained a post doctoral fellowship in quantitative psychology at the L. L. Thurstone Psychometric Laboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Between 1967 and 1970, he was an assistant professor and taught courses on personality and factor analysis in the Department of Psychology at UNC. In 1970 he took a position as an associate professor in the School of Psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and rose to full professor in 1981. He taught courses in introductory statistics, psychometric theory, factor analysis, multivariate statistics, structural equation modelling, personality theory, and introduction to psychology during his career. In 1972 he published the well- received advanced text The Foundations of Factor Analysis. In 1982 he was second author with Lawrence James and Jean M. Brett of Causal Analysis: Models, Assumptions and Data. In the interim he published journal articles and book chapters on factor analysis, factor indeterminacy in factor analysis, factor rotation, confirmatory factor analysis, psychometric theory, structural equation modeling, and goodness of fit indices. The work on the book on Causal Analysis with James and Brett led him to a deep interest in the philosophy of causality, objectivity and philosophy in general. He struggled through Wittgenstein and Kant to a passable understanding of each, being strongly influenced by Kant's concepts of analysis and synthesis in thought, and saw their role in metaphors of objectivity, causality, and the self. He published several articles in the journal Philosophy of Science on the history of exploratory statistics in empiricism; metaphoric origins of objectivity, subjectivity and consciousness; a synthesis of deterministic and probabilistic causality with the functional relation concept; and the curve-fitting problem and degrees of freedom. He was strongly influenced by the works of George Lakoff on metaphor and abstract thought and their origin in embodied perception and action. As a result, Mulaik has argued that science is based on the metaphor that \\"science is knowledge of objects\\". In 1997 he was co-editor with L. Harlow and J. H. Steiger of the book What If There Were No Significance Tests? in which he was the principal author of a chapter with N Raju and R. Harshman defending significance tests in appropriate contexts. In 2009 he published the text Linear Causal Modeling with Structural Equations and in 2010 a revision of the earlier Foundations of Factor Analysis. Work with Interlingua His interest in Interlingua came as an undergraduate at the University of Utah in 1953 when he discovered a column in Science News Letter of science abstracts in Interlingua. He wrote an article on Interlingua for the student literary magazine which came to the attention of Alexander Gode, then the leader of the Interlingua Division of Science Service, who asked for and got permission to print the Mulaik's article in official publications. Mulaik then produced a periodical newsletter Le Foro from 1961 to 1963. After marriage and two sons, and assuming an assistant professorship at the University of North Carolina, he set aside interest in Interlingua until about 1994 when he rediscovered Interlingua in a listserv on linguistics in the internet. He turned to an interest in the problem of the grammatical particles in Interlingua which he had in 1961 when he realized that the Latin grammatical particles in Interlingua were not sanctioned by the prototype principle at the base of Interlingua's vocabulary. They were a provisional solution for the particles when an early study in 1939 by Dr. Gode at the International Auxiliary Language Association yielded only 73 particles, an insufficient number. Mulaik determined that the flaw in Gode's study was that he used only 4 source languages, of which English, with Germanic particles, made little contribution to the particles. That left only three romance languages from which to draw particles by the common prototype principle, and if there were less than three of these with a common prototype for a particle, no solution was produced. Mulaik decided that what was needed was to search other minor romance languages for candidates that had a common historical prototype with those in the major romance languages of French, Italian and Spanish/Portuguese. Mulaik chose Catalan/Occitan and Romanian as \\"supplementary languages\\" to search in these cases. In 2003 Mulaik completed a study of the particle question with 183 particles sanctioned by the prototype principle or other techniques of Interlingua. In 2012 he published a book Interlingua Grammar and Method for The Use of the International Vocabulary As an International Auxiliary Language, which is available from Amazon.com and other vendors. The book is a detailed development of the grammar and sows his personal methods to determine the vocabulary, with several chapters on texts in Interlingua. The book also has 3248-word glossaries between English and Interlingua and Interlingua and English. He was the President of the Societate American pro Interlingua, and the editor of its quarterly journal, Confluentes. He was also the editor of the psychological journal Multivariate Behavioral Research for 8 years. References External links *Stanley A.

The species is also cultivated in other regions as an ornamental and as a garden culinary herb. The plant is also reportedly naturalized in Cuba. Description Allium canadense has an edible bulb covered with a dense skin of brown fibers. The plant also has strong onion odor and taste. Crow garlic (Allium vineale) is similar, but it has a strong garlic taste. The narrow, grass-like leaves originate near the base of the stem, which is topped by a dome-like cluster of star-shaped, pink or white flowers. These flowers may be partially or entirely replaced by bulblets. When present, the flowers are hermaphroditic (both male and female organs) and are pollinated by American bees (not honeybees) and other insects. It typically flowers in the spring and early summer, from May to June. Varieties The bulblet-producing form is classified as A. canadense var. canadense. It was once thought that the tree onion could be related to this plant, but it is now known that the cultivated tree onion is a hybrid between the common onion (A. cepa) and Welsh onion (A. fistulosum), classified as A. √ó proliferum. Five varieties of the species are widely recognized: *Allium canadense var. canadense - most pedicels replaced by bulbils, rarely producing fruits or seeds; most of the range of the species *Allium canadense var. ecristatum Ownbey tepals deep pink and rather thick; coastal plain of Texas *Allium canadense var. fraseri Ownbey \\\\- flowers white; Great Plains from Texas to Kansas *Allium canadense var. hyacinthoides (Bush) Ownbey \\\\- tepals pink, thin, flowers fragrant; northern Texas and southern Oklahoma *Allium canadense var. lavandulare (Bates) Ownbey & Aase \\\\- flowers lavender, not fragrant; northern Arkansas to South Dakota *Allium canadense var. mobilense (Regel) Ownbey \\\\- flowers lilac, pedicels thread-like; southeastern US Uses The Canada onion is cultivated as a vegetable in home gardens in Cuba, scattered locally in the south to western parts of the island. It was formerly collected from the wild to be eaten by Native Americans and by European settlers. People in the Cherokee Nation continue the tradition of picking and cooking wild onions in early spring. Various Native American tribes also used the plant for other purposes: for example, rubbing the plant on the body for protection from insect, lizard, scorpion, and tarantula bites. This plant can cause gastroenteritis in young children who ingest parts of this plant. Chronic ingestion of the bulbs reduces iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, which can lead to problems. No specific treatment is suggested other than to prevent dehydration (Lampe and McCann 1985). Livestock have also been poisoned by ingesting wild onions, and some have died (Pipal 1918). Horses have developed hemolytic anemia from ingesting wild onion leaves (Scoggan 1989).

Azuga is located at the foot of the Baiu mountains, and contains the longest ski run in Romania, the Sorica - together with other ski slopes. Formerly heavy industrialized, Azuga retains now a bottled water factory - a leftover from the famous beer factory that brewed Azuga Beer (now produced elsewhere in Romania under license), a sparkling wine factory, wine tasting and lodging (Cramele Rhein, owned by Halewood International). The beer factory, the glassware factory and the wool cloth factory were privatized and now are closed and completely demolished. The refractory materials factory, also privatized, is still standing but it is closed. The town offers a dramatic view over the Bucegi mountains, even from street level and especially from the top of the Sorica mountain (at the gondola arrival station). Azuga is one of the most famous mountain resorts of Prahova Valley. Tourists who decide to spend their winter vacation in Azuga, have two of the best ski slopes in the country: Sorica and Cazacu, together with a large offer for lodging. Until the winter of 2002, Azuga was known as an industrial town but thanks to the particularly mountain landscape offered by the Baiului Mountains, the town was turned into a resort. Shortly after, Sorica slope has been certified by the International Ski Federation. Today in Azuga are many hotels and hostels that can provide accommodation for tourists. Another option is the accommodation in local homes at lower prices. Tourism The town is an emerging ski resort that sees tremendous development in tourism infrastructure. On Sorica slope enthusiasts of winter sports can ski over a length of 2100 meters (vertical drop 561 m). The slope is recommended for both beginners and experienced skiers. There are also two slopes descending the Cazacu mountain, one has 1920 meters in length (with a drop of 530 m) and the other, more suitable for beginners, just 400 meters in length, with a drop of 115 m. Slopes are equipped with skilifts and a new Leitner gondola lift which goes all the way to the top of Sorica slope, allowing skiers to choose between the two main slopes (access to Cazacu slope implies some tens of meters of ascending, eased by a small skilift). The gondola does not go to the very top of the mountain; the top station is a few meters below the top, for weather protection in winter (the almost constant winds on the ridge would present icing issues, making morning startups difficult as sometimes the only alternative is the snow groomer - snowmobiles could not get there in fresh high snow). In the summer, Azuga is a preferred destination for hikers, being a starting point for trips to various mountain destinations in Predeal, Bu»ôteni or Sinaia. Forest unpaved (but practicable) roads invite many bicycle enthusiasts, whom can drive along the Azuga River which is peppered with small wooden artificial waterfalls that oxygenate the water for the many trouts that populate naturally the river.

The 30-minute engagement, which historian J. R. Edmondson describes as \\"the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution\\", occurred on the grounds of Mission Concepci√≥n, south of what is now Downtown San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas. On October 13, the newly created Texian Army under Stephen F. Austin had marched towards Bexar, where General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos commanded the remaining Mexican soldiers in Texas. On October 27, Austin sent Bowie and Fannin, with 90 soldiers, to find a defensible spot near Bexar for the Texian Army to rest. After choosing a site near Mission Concepci√≥n, the scouting party camped for the night and sent a courier to notify Austin. After learning that the Texian Army was divided, Cos sent Ugartechea with 275 soldiers to attack the Texians camped at Concepci√≥n. The Texians took cover in a horseshoe-shaped gully; their good defensive position, longer firing range, and better ammunition helped them to repel several Mexican attacks, and the Mexican soldiers retreated just 30 minutes before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived. Historians estimate that between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed, while only one Texian soldier died. Background The newly organized Texian Army, determined to put a decisive end to Mexican control over Texas, began marching towards San Antonio de Bexar on October 13, 1835.Barr (1990), p. 6. Days earlier, General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos, brother-in-law of the Mexican president, had arrived in Bexar to take command of all the Mexican forces in Texas.Barr (1990), p. 12. By October 20 the Texiansled by Stephen F. Austin, the first empresario to bring English-speaking settlers to TexasMexican Texas included the land north of the Medina and the Nueces Rivers, northeast of the Rio Grande, west of San Antonio de B√©xar, and east of the Sabine River. According to Manchaca's Recovering History, Constructing Race: The Indian, Black, and White Roots of Mexican Americans, by 1834 an estimated 30,000 English-speakers lived in Texas, compared with only 7,800 of Spanish heritage.had reached Salado Creek and initiated a siege of B√©xar.Barr (1990), p. 15.Hardin (1994), p. 53. To keep the Texians from examining Mexican defensive measures, Mexican troops attempted to restrict access to and from the city. Despite those efforts, several people were able to leave their homes and join the Texians.Barr (1990), p. 17. Among those was James Bowie, who was well known for his fighting prowess; stories of his exploits in the Sandbar Fight and his search for the lost San Saba mine had been widely reported.Hardin (1994), p. 29. On October 22, Austin named Bowie a colonel and gave him joint command of the 1st Battalion with Captain James W. Fannin.Barr (1990),p. 18. Before nightfall the 1st Battalion began a reconnaissance mission to evaluate the former missions around San Antonio as potential campsites. Locals familiar with the area, Juan Segu√≠n and his Texians, would guide the men along the river.Hardin (1994), p. 29. After investigating three of the missions, Bowie and Fannin selected Mission San Francisco de la Espada as the most promising campsite.Barr (1990), p. 19. The rest of the Texian Army joined them there early on October 27\\\\. Eager to move closer to Bexar, Austin immediately sent Bowie and Fannin to find a good defensive spot for the army to rest that night.Barr (1990), p. 22. Prelude Colonel James Bowie led the Texian forces during the Battle of Concepci√≥n. Bowie and Fannin were accompanied by ninety soldiers, divided into four companies led by Captains Andrew Briscoe, Robert Coleman, Michael Goheen, and Valentine Bennet.Todish et al. (1998), p. 23. The group took a northerly route, following the San Antonio River past Missions San Juan and San Jos√©. Along the way they encountered a small party of Mexican scouts, who retreated to Bexar after a brief skirmish. Approximately from San Antonio de Bexar and from the Texian camp at Espada,Barr (1990), p. 23. the Texian scouting party stopped at Mission Concepci√≥n.Hardin (1994), p. 30. Five hundred yards (460 m) west of the mission, the San Antonio River curved in a small horseshoe shape, with the two sides of the river's curve approximately apart. According to historian Alwyn Barr, \\"trees shaded both sides of the broad riverbottom which lay about six feet below the level of the rolling praire nearby\\". Rather than return immediately to Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to bring Austin directions to Concepci√≥n. The next day, an angry Austin issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with court-martial. The Texian scouting party divided into two camps. Fannin supervised 49 men at the south part of the horseshoe bend,Edmondson (2000), p. 221. while Bowie and the remaining men camped at the northern part of the bend. Any Mexican force coming from the north would be caught in their cross-fire. Pickets were stationed around the area and in the mission tower, which offered greater visibility. As they settled down for the evening, the Texians were surprised to see a Mexican cannonball, fired from one of the church towers in Bexar, hit just beyond their camp. Many of the Texian soldiers believed that a priest from the mission had informed the Mexican Army of their position. Battle Map of the battle site Hoping to neutralize the Texian force at Concepci√≥n before the remainder of the Texian Army arrived, Cos ordered Colonel Domingo Ugartechea to lead an early-morning assault on October 28\\\\. At 6:00 a.m., Ugartechea left Bexar with 275 Mexican soldiers and 2 cannons. Heavy fog delayed their approach, and the Mexican soldiers did not reach Concepci√≥n until 7:30 or 8:00 a.m.Barr (1990), p. 24. A Mexican cavalry scout fired at Texian picket Henry Karnes; after returning fire, Karnes ran back to his company, frustrated because, as he put it, \\"Boys, the scoundrels have shot off my powder horn\\". The Texians took refuge in the gully, firing from its edge before dropping the down to the river level to reload. As the remaining Texian sentries hurried to join the main body of Texian soldiers, Pen Jarvis was struck by a Mexican bullet and fell down the river bank. The bullet hit a knife Jarvis had slipped through the front of his belt, and he suffered only bruises. The Texian position was surrounded by trees, leaving the Mexican cavalry no room to maneuver. The 200 members of the cavalry remained on the west bank of the river, behind the Texians, to foil any escape attempts.Edmondson (2000), p. 222. Lieutenant Colonel Jos√© Maria Mendosa brought the Mexican infantry and artillery across the river to a position below that of the Texians. In response, Texians trimmed undergrowth near their camp to provide better visibility and dug steps into the embankment so that they could more easily climb up to fire. The two sides skirmished desultorily for two hours, until the fog began to lift. At that point, 50-60 Mexican infantrymen crossed the prairie to surround the Texians. Seeing their approach, Bowie shouted to his Texian forces, \\"Keep under cover, boys, and reserve your fire; we haven't a man to spare!\\" At from the Texian position, the Mexican infantry halted and formed a line with the cannon in the middle. They began firing as they advanced toward the Texian positions, to little effect. For the most part, the Mexican volleys passed over the heads of the Texians. According to Texian Noah Smithwick, \\"grapeshot and canister thrashed through the pecan trees overhead, raining a shower of ripe nuts down on us, and I saw men picking them up and eating them with as little concern as if they were being shaken down by a norther.\\" In his official report to Austin, Bowie remarked that \\"The discharge from the enemy was one continued blaze of fire, whilst that from our lines, was more slowly delivered, but with good aim and deadly effect.\\" The Mexican infantry were assigned Brown Bess muskets, which had a maximum range of only , compared to the effective range of the Texian long rifles. The Texians were short of ammunition, however, and although Mexican ammunition was plentiful, it was poor quality. In several cases, Mexican musket balls bounced off Texian soldiers, causing little damage other than a bruise. When Mexican officers ordered a charge on the south bend held by Fannin, Bowie sent Coleman's company to help. Most of the Texian reinforcements maneuvered to their new position from below the river bank, but several rose from cover and dashed across the prairie. One of them, Richard Andrews, was hit in the side with grapeshotBarr (1990), p. 25. and died several hours after the battle. As the reinforcements reached the southern part of the horseshoe, the Mexican infantry fell back, leaving the cannon within of the Texians. Texians redirected their fire to the cannoneers. After three different sets of gunners were killed or wounded, the cannons were abandoned.Hardin (1994), p. 32. The Mexican infantry attempted three attacks; all were repulsed. As the Mexican buglers called for a retreat, the infantry fell back beyond Texian rifle range. The Mexican cavalry was sent to retrieve wounded men and the cannon. As the cavalry approached, Bowie led a charge onto the prairie.Hardin (1994), p. 33. The Texians quickly captured the cannon and turned it on the fleeing Mexican soldiers. Grapeshot killed one of the mule drivers, causing his caisson to go out of control and \\"careen[...] through the shattered Mexican ranks\\". The battle had lasted only 30 minutes. Aftermath Captain James W. Fannin was one of the commanders at the Battle of Concepci√≥n. Austin had intended to reunite the two parts of his army early on October 28, but the group camping at Mission Espada had delayed their departure to unsuccessfully pursue a company that had deserted. Lieutenant Colonel William Barret Travis and his company of cavalry rode ahead of the main body of the army. When they reached Concepci√≥n, the Mexican Army was still visible in the distance.Edmondson (2000), p. 223. The small band of Texian cavalry pursued but the Mexican soldiers reached Bexar safely. Less than 30 minutes after the battle ended, the rest of the Texian Army arrived. Austin felt that the Mexican morale must be low after their defeat and wanted to proceed immediately to Bexar. Bowie and other officers refused, as they believed Bexar was too heavily fortified. The Texians searched the area for any Mexican equipment which had been abandoned during the retreat. They found several boxes of cartridges. Complaining that the Mexican powder was \\"little better than pounded charcoal\\", the Texians emptied the cartridges but kept the bullets.Hardin (1994), p. 34. That evening, Austin allowed a local priest and men from Bexar to retrieve the bodies of the Mexican soldiers who had died in battle.Barr (1990), p. 26. Barr estimated that at least 14 Mexican soldiers were killed, with an additional 39 wounded, several of whom died later. Timothy Todish et al., in their book The Alamo Sourcebook, estimated that 60 Mexican soldiers were killed, while historian Stephen Hardin claimed that 76 Mexican soldiers died. The only Texian to die in battle was Andrews,Andrews County, Texas is named for Richard Andrews. and Jarvis was the only Texian classified as wounded. This battle, which historian J. R. Edmondson describes as \\"the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution\\",Edmondson (2000), p. 224. was the last offensive against the Texians that Cos would order.Barr (1990), p. 27. Barr attributed the Texian victory to \\"able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower\\". The Mexican cavalry was unable to fight effectively in the wooded, riverbottom terrain, and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had a much lower range than that of the Texians. Although Barr continues that the battle \\"should have taught ... lessons on Mexican courage and the value of a good defensive position\\",Barr (1990), p. 60. Hardin believes that \\"the relative ease of the victory at Concepci√≥n instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies\\".Hardin (1994), p. 35. A soldier who later served under Fannin complained that Fannin's \\"former experience in fighting Mexicans [at Concepci√≥n] had led him to neglect to take such precautionary measures as were requisite\\", which may have contributed to his defeat at the Battle of Coleto in March 1836.

He is a former member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for the Country Liberal Party. Early life Elferink was born in the Netherlands and moved to Australia with his parents and older siblings as a three year old in 1968. His family settled in Darwin, and he subsequently graduated from Casuarina High School. In 1983, Elferink joined the Northern Territory Police as a cadet. He subsequently rose to the rank of Sergeant (Qualified to Senior Sergeant), and served in both Darwin and Alice Springs. While in the police force, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Monash University in 1997, completing the course by distance education. In 2008 Elferink graduated with a Bachelor of Laws from the University of New England. He was admitted to the bar in October 2009. Political career In 1997, Elferink won Country Liberal preselection for the rural electorate of MacDonnell after incumbent Labor member Neil Bell announced his retirement. On paper, Elferink faced daunting odds; the ALP held the seat with a majority of 16 points. However, the ALP preselected union organiser Mark Wheeler, thus prompting indigenous leader Kenneth Lechleitner to run as an independent and direct his preferences to the CLP. Elferink picked up enough of Leichleitner's preferences to take the seat on a swing of 18.7 percent. Although a redistribution ahead of the 2001 election erased Elferink's majority and made Macdonnell a notional Labor seat, Elferink was re-elected even as a massive swing to Labor across the Territory allowed it to win government for the first time. He served in the Shadow Ministry under Opposition Leaders Denis Burke and Terry Mills. Elferink became an increasingly prominent member of the shadow ministry during his first two years in a portfolio. However, by early 2003, Elferink became increasingly frustrated with Burke's leadership who was struggling to maintain his grip on the party at the time. In June 2003, Elferink resigned as Shadow Minister for Local Government and Indigenous Affairs and publicly slammed Burke's leadership, labelling him \\"arrogant\\" and calling for him to be replaced by rival Mills. He later returned to the shadow ministry in September, taking on the portfolio of Police, Fire and Emergency Services. By late 2004, Elferink was once again becoming a key member of the parliamentary party, and this was reflected when, on 12 October, he was made Opposition Whip. Elferink was subsequently rewarded for this support, being made Leader of Opposition Business and Shadow Minister for Community Development, Housing, Local Government, Sport and Recreation, Regional Development and Indigenous Affairs, while maintaining the position of Whip. Elferink stood for re- election at the 2005 election. However, facing star candidate and indigenous activist Alison Anderson, Elferink was heavily defeated, suffering a two-party swing of 20.6 percent. He later served as party director for the CLP. In the years between his occupation of a seat in parliament, Elferink occasionally worked for the Centre for Democratic Institutions in the Pacific on a number of occasions. Working to help improve the democracies of Fiji and the Solomon Islands.http://archives.cap.anu.edu.au/cdi_anu_edu_au/.FIJ/2005-06/D_P/2006_06_FIJI_PRO_MP_Induction_wrksh/2006_06_FIJI_PRO_MP_Induction_Press_coverage.pdf Elferink contested the seat of Port Darwin at 9 August 2008 Legislative Assembly general election,http://www.countryliberals.org.au/content.php?id=35 and defeated Labor Party incumbent Kerry Sacilotto.http://www.ntnews.com.au/article/2008/08/10/5085_ntelection08.html In opposition, he held the Shadow portfolios of Shadow Treasurer, Shadow Minister for Public Employment, Shadow Minister for Essential Services as well as being the Leader of Opposition Business in the Territory Assembly. When the CLP won the 2012 Northern Territory election, Elferink was made a minister in the Mills Ministry: Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, and Minister for Correctional Services. On 6 March, he was given the additional portfolios of Treasurer and Corporate and Information Services. For two years, he served in cabinet alongside Anderson, who crossed the floor to the CLP in 2011, but was dropped from the cabinet in 2013. Elferink had courted controversy on a number of occasions with his hands on approach to involving himself in domestic violence occurrences being facetiously labelled \\"Captain Justice\\", by local press because of his propensity to personally intervene in domestic violence incidents when they occurred, on one occasion being assaulted himself in defence of domestic violence victim. As Attorney General Elferink also embarked on an ambitious campaign of court reform in the Territory culminating in the abolition of the Magistrates Court and the effective introduction of a three tier court system in the Northern Territory giving quazi-judicial powers to the NT Civil Appeals Tribunal. These steps were welcomed by the legal fraternity of the Northern Territory. Further reforms included the construction of the new Supreme Court Building in Alice Springs and the introduction of the Children's Court in Darwin. Further components of Elferink's Attorney Generalship included his personal drafting of the Pillars of Justice reform package. These changes were the most fundamental shake up of the Department of Justice and Attorney General since self-government, putting the structures in place that were necessary to form the basis of the future course of the justice system in the Northern Territory. Elferink also introduced \\"No Body No Parole\\" laws in the NT, which prevents a convicted murderer from receiving parole when that murderer refused to identify the location of the body to authorities. An example of this in the Northern Territory was Bradley John Murdoch, who had been convicted of the murder of Peter Falconio but never revealed the location of the body.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/nt-attorneygeneral-john- elferink-announces-plans-to-introduce-no-body-no-parole-legislation/news- story/2d71611d536496b60d39a0ef033b5d39 Elferink also introduced controversial 'paperless arrest' laws that saw a substantial fall in the number of assaults occurring in the Darwin CBD. The laws were challenged in the High Court of Australia with the court ruling that the laws were not punitive in nature and were lawful. Throughout his time in parliament Elferink remained a strident critic of passive welfare and its effects. The paperless arrest system was in part a response to the negative impact and overwhelming anti-social behaviour which plagued the Northern Territory. As Health Minister Elferink was tasked with commencing the long delayed Palmerston Hospital. Shortly after taking the portfolio Elferink had brought the Territory Government to a position where the Hospital was commenced under Elferink's stewardship. Mental Health issues also were of deep concern to Elferink who took a number of steps to improve mental health services in the Northern Territory including the jurisdictions first mental health ward for juveniles. The court system was also supported with the addition of mental health workers as Court Clinicians. Elferink drove the introduction of the Northern Territory's first suicide action plan in an effort to reduce the Territory's tragically high suicide rate. After supporting Willem Westra van Holthe's attempted party-room coup against Giles on 2 February, Elferink was named deputy leader of the CLP, putting him on track to become Deputy Chief Minister. This challenge was brought undone less than a day later, but Elferink remained in cabinet. On 18 November 2015, Elferink announced that he would retire at the next election to be held in August 2016. After announcing his retirement Elferink continued to pursue development for the NT in the surprising area of satellite launching capability with an Australian investor who wanted to buy the Sea Launch facility at Long Beach and bring it to Darwin. Elferink led the Northern Territory Government's mission in the negotiation processes. John Elferink is credited with substantial advances in the NT Corrections system, introducing the Northern Territory Corrections Industry banner and the Sentenced to a Job program that saw prisoners trained and skilled ready for the work place which they entered while still serving time. Chief Minister Adam Giles subsequently stated Elferink's role in prison reform should be applauded. On 25 July 2016, footage of abuse to children as young as 13 years old within Darwin's Don Dale Youth Corrections Centre was aired in a Four Corners exclusive on the ABC. When Elferink was asked about the incidents by Four Corners journalists, he stated, in relation to the boy in the footage, Dylan Voller, that \\"Where there has even been a suggestion of criminality we've looked at it. Unfortunately these kids come into the system, these juveniles come into the system pre- broken and we have to cope with them, particularly when they are violent.\\" The release of the footage resulted in the appointment of the Royal Commission into Juvenile Detention in the Northern Territory and the dismissal of Elferink as Corrections Minister on 26 July. He nevertheless retained all his other portfolios. Subsequent to Elferink's removal from the role, Chief Minister Adam Giles described his decision to remove him as the \\"...wrong decision...\\" citing Elferink's hard work in the corrections field and accusing the ABC's Four Corners program of bias. As a result of the Royal Commission no criminal charges were brought to bear against any individual. Elferink's criticism of the ABC's 4 Corners program became more pointed as a result as 4 Corners had alleged torture and barbarism. ‚ÄúWe have acted and always acted when in government with absolute probity, something 4 Corners had explained to them at length, something they chose not to run with and as a consequence they put out a story saying that we tortured children, that we acted with barbarism in our hearts and it made comparisons to Abu Ghraib,‚Äù Mr Elferink said. ‚ÄúAll of those things are indictable offences, none of that was found to be true.‚Äùhttps://www.ntnews.com.au/news/crime-court/royal-commission-yields-no- charges-john-elferink-abc-at-odds-over-need-for-70-million-inquiry/news- story/9e356724272ba7fb8349621bca3eff2f Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said that he believed that Elferink was the best Corrections Minister he'd ever encountered in politics.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/jeff- kennett-rehabilitation-is-the-key-to-youth-correction/news- story/b87bfc53999c340b4a7426ee381db405 Elferink had ordered that Don Dale be shut down in 2014 and detainees were moved into a new facility. This was a direct response to the Vita review and incidents in the Don Dale facility. Elferink publicly released the Vita review without any legal demand that he do so in the interest of full disclosure. In 2013 Elferink had also attempted to introduce international inspectors into the Northern Territory Corrections system by introducing legislation to ratify OPCAT (Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture). In 2016 he was forced to withdraw the bill from the House as the Federal Parliament had failed to ratify their part of the arrangement. In October 2018 the Parole Board of the NT reported Elferink's reform programs continued to bear fruit. The COMMIT program which Elferink championed and drove was recognised by the Parole Board of the NT as being a significant contributor to prisoner rehabilitation in the NT.https://www.ntnews.com.au/news/opinion/parole-program-appears- worthwhile/news-story/d518ec484d3f510e5c0f3c438e559661 Throughout his political career Elferink remained open about the sexual abuse he'd suffered as a child. He always maintained his openness because he wanted to show people that a fully productive life was possible in spite of the challenges that people had to cope with from childhood. Elferink maintained the belief that waiting for perpetrator to apologise was to give that perpetrator ongoing power. \\"The moment you say to another person, 'I cannot be happy or complete until you apologise', you have given away your ability to be happy and handed it to a third party.\\" he said. =Minor controversy= In 2015 Mr Elferink, then NT Attorney-General, reportedly told a Labor politician during a parliamentary debate he was \\"really tempted to give her a slap right now, figuratively speaking,\\". Mr Elferink apologised for his reaction saying the comment was \\"unwise\\" and only expressed it in the figurative sense meaning a rebuke.

A land boom is the rapid increase in the market price of real property such as housing until they reach unsustainable levels and then decline. This period, during the run up to the crash, is also known as froth. The questions of whether real estate bubbles can be identified and prevented, and whether they have broader macroeconomic significance, are answered differently by schools of economic thought, as detailed below. Bubbles in housing markets are more critical than stock market bubbles. Historically, equity price busts occur on average every 13 years, last for 2.5 years, and result in about 4 percent loss in GDP. Housing price busts are less frequent, but last nearly twice as long and lead to output losses that are twice as large (IMF World Economic Outlook, 2003). A recent laboratory experimental studyIkromov, Nuridding and Abdullah Yavas, 2012a, \\"Asset Characteristics and Boom and Bust Periods: An Experimental Study\\". Real Estate Economics. 40, 508‚Äì535. also shows that, compared to financial markets, real estate markets involve longer boom and bust periods. Prices decline slower because the real estate market is less liquid. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 was related to the bursting of real estate bubbles that had begun in various countries during the 2000s. Identification and prevention US house price trend (1998‚Äì2008) as measured by the Case‚ÄìShiller index Ratio of Melbourne median house prices to Australian annual wages, 1965 to 2010 As with all types of economic bubbles, disagreement exists over whether or not a real estate bubble can be identified or predicted, then perhaps prevented. Speculative bubbles are persistent, systematic and increasing deviations of actual prices from their fundamental values. Bubbles can often be hard to identify, even after the fact, due to difficulty in accurately estimating intrinsic values. In real estate, fundamentals can be estimated from rental yields (where real estate is then considered in a similar vein to stocks and other financial assets) or based on a regression of actual prices on a set of demand and/or supply variables. Within mainstream economics, it can be posed that real estate bubbles cannot be identified as they occur and cannot or should not be prevented, with government and central bank policy rather cleaning up after the bubble bursts. American economist Robert Shiller of the Case‚ÄìShiller Home Price Index of home prices in 20 metro cities across the United States indicated on May 31, 2011 that a \\"Home Price Double Dip [is] Confirmed\\" and British magazine The Economist, argue that housing market indicators can be used to identify real estate bubbles. Some argue further that governments and central banks can and should take action to prevent bubbles from forming, or to deflate existing bubbles. Macroeconomic significance Within mainstream economics, economic bubbles, and in particular real estate bubbles, are not considered major concerns. Within some schools of heterodox economics, by contrast, real estate bubbles are considered of critical importance and a fundamental cause of financial crises and ensuing economic crises. The pre-dominating economic perspective is that increases in housing prices result in little or no wealth effect, namely it does not affect the consumption behavior of households not looking to sell. The house price becoming compensation for the higher implicit rent costs for owning. Increasing house prices can have a negative effect on consumption through increased rent inflation and a higher propensity to save given expected rent increase. In some schools of heterodox economics, notably Austrian economics and Post-Keynesian economics, real estate bubbles are seen as an example of credit bubbles (pejoratively, speculative bubbles), because property owners generally use borrowed money to purchase property, in the form of mortgages. These are then argued to cause financial and hence economic crises. This is first argued empirically ‚Äì numerous real estate bubbles have been followed by economic slumps, and it is argued that there is a cause- effect relationship between these. The Post-Keynesian theory of debt deflation takes a demand-side view, arguing that property owners not only feel richer but borrow to (i) consume against the increased value of their property ‚Äì by taking out a home equity line of credit, for instance; or (ii) speculate by buying property with borrowed money in the expectation that it will rise in value. When the bubble bursts, the value of the property decreases but not the level of debt. The burden of repaying or defaulting on the loan depresses aggregate demand, it is argued, and constitutes the proximate cause of the subsequent economic slump.  Housing market indicators  UK house prices between 1975 and 2006, adjusted for inflation Robert Shiller's plot of U.S. home prices, population, building costs, and bond yields, from Irrational Exuberance, 2d ed. Shiller shows that inflation adjusted U.S. home prices increased 0.4% per year from 1890‚Äì2004, and 0.7% per year from 1940‚Äì2004, whereas U.S. census data from 1940‚Äì2004 shows that the self-assessed value increased 2% per year. In attempting to identify bubbles before they burst, economists have developed a number of financial ratios and economic indicators that can be used to evaluate whether homes in a given area are fairly valued. By comparing current levels to previous levels that have proven unsustainable in the past (i.e. led to or at least accompanied crashes), one can make an educated guess as to whether a given real estate market is experiencing a bubble. Indicators describe two interwoven aspects of housing bubble: a valuation component and a debt (or leverage) component. The valuation component measures how expensive houses are relative to what most people can afford, and the debt component measures how indebted households become in buying them for home or profit (and also how much exposure the banks accumulate by lending for them). A basic summary of the progress of housing indicators for U.S. cities is provided by Business Week. See also: real estate economics and real estate trends. = Housing affordability measures = * The price to income ratio is the basic affordability measure for housing in a given area. It is generally the ratio of median house prices to median familial disposable incomes, expressed as a percentage or as years of income. It is sometimes compiled separately for first-time buyers and termed attainability. This ratio, applied to individuals, is a basic component of mortgage lending decisions. According to a back-of-the-envelope calculation by Goldman Sachs, a comparison of median home prices to median household income suggests that U.S. housing in 2005 was overvalued by 10%. \\"However, this estimate is based on an average mortgage rate of about 6%, and we expect rates to rise\\", the firm's economics team wrote in a recent report.seek.estate According to Goldman's figures, a one-percentage-point rise in mortgage rates would reduce the fair value of home prices by 8%. * The deposit to income ratio is the minimum required downpayment for a typical mortgage , expressed in months or years of income. It is especially important for first-time buyers without existing home equity; if the down payment becomes too high then those buyers may find themselves \\"priced out\\" of the market. For example, this ratio was equal to one year of income in the UK. Another variant is what the United States's National Association of Realtors calls the \\"housing affordability index\\" in its publications. (The soundness of the NAR's methodology was questioned by some analysts as it does not account for inflation.seek.estate Other analysts, however, consider the measure appropriate, because both the income and housing cost data are expressed in terms that include inflation and, all things being equal, the index implicitly includes inflation). * The affordability index measures the ratio of the actual monthly cost of the mortgage to take-home income. It is used more in the United Kingdom where nearly all mortgages are variable and pegged to bank lending rates. It offers a much more realistic measure of the ability of households to afford housing than the crude price to income ratio. However it is more difficult to calculate, and hence the price-to-income ratio is still more commonly used by pundits. In recent years, lending practices have relaxed, allowing greater multiples of income to be borrowed. Some speculate that this practice in the long term cannot be sustained and may ultimately lead to unaffordable mortgage payments, and repossession for many. * The median multiple measures the ratio of the median house price to the median annual household income. This measure has historically hovered around a value of 3.0 or less, but in recent years has risen dramatically, especially in markets with severe public policy constraints on land and development. Inflation-adjusted home prices in Japan (1980‚Äì2005) compared to home price appreciation in the United States, Britain, and Australia (1995‚Äì2005) = Housing debt measures = * The housing debt to income ratio or debt-service ratio is the ratio of mortgage payments to disposable income. When the ratio gets too high, households become increasingly dependent on rising property values to service their debt. A variant of this indicator measures total home ownership costs, including mortgage payments, utilities and property taxes, as a percentage of a typical household's monthly pre-tax income; for example see RBC Economics' reports for the Canadian markets.June 2, 2005 report * The housing debt to equity ratio (not to be confused with the corporate debt to equity ratio), also called loan to value, is the ratio of the mortgage debt to the value of the underlying property; it measures financial leverage. This ratio increases when the homeowner takes a second mortgage or home equity loan using the accumulated equity as collateral. A ratio greater higher than 1 implies that owner's equity is negative. = Housing ownership and rent measures = * Bubbles can be determined when an increase in housing prices is higher than the rise in rents. In the US, rent between 1984 and 2013 has risen steadily at about 3% per year, whereas between 1997 and 2002 housing prices rose 6% per year. Between 2011 and the third-quarter of 2013 housing prices rose 5.83% and rent increased 2%. * The ownership ratio is the proportion of households who own their homes as opposed to renting. It tends to rise steadily with incomes. Also, governments often enact measures such as tax cuts or subsidized financing to encourage and facilitate home ownership. If a rise in ownership is not supported by a rise in incomes, it can mean either that buyers are taking advantage of low interest rates (which must eventually rise again as the economy heats up) or that home loans are awarded more liberally, to borrowers with poor credit. Therefore, a high ownership ratio combined with an increased rate of subprime lending may signal higher debt levels associated with bubbles. * The price-to-earnings ratio or P/E ratio is the common metric used to assess the relative valuation of equities. To compute the P/E ratio for the case of a rented house, divide the price of the house by its potential earnings or net income, which is the market annual rent of the house minus expenses, which include maintenance and property taxes. This formula is: :: \\\\mbox{House P/E ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{House price}}{\\\\mbox{Rent} - \\\\mbox{Expenses}} :The house price-to-earnings ratio provides a direct comparison with P/E ratios utilised to analyze other uses of the money tied up in a home. Compare this ratio to the simpler but less accurate price-rent ratio below. * The price-rent ratio is the average cost of ownership divided by the received rent income (if buying to let) or the estimated rent (if buying to reside): :: \\\\mbox{House Price-Rent ratio} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{House price}}{\\\\mbox{Monthly Rent} \\\\times 12} :The latter is often measured using the \\"owner's equivalent rent\\" numbers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It can be viewed as the real estate equivalent of stocks' price-earnings ratio; in other terms it measures how much the buyer is paying for each dollar of received rent income (or dollar saved from rent spending). Rents, just like corporate and personal incomes, are generally tied very closely to supply and demand fundamentals; one rarely sees an unsustainable \\"rent bubble\\" (or \\"income bubble\\" for that matter). Therefore a rapid increase of home prices combined with a flat renting market can signal the onset of a bubble. The U.S. price-rent ratio was 18% higher than its long-run average as of October 2004. * The gross rental yield, a measure used in the United Kingdom, is the total yearly gross rent divided by the house price and expressed as a percentage: :: \\\\mbox{Gross Rental Yield} = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{Monthly rent} \\\\times 12}{\\\\mbox{House price}} \\\\times 100\\\\% :This is the reciprocal of the house price-rent ratio. The net rental yield deducts the landlord's expenses (and sometimes estimated rental voids) from the gross rent before doing the above calculation; this is the reciprocal of the house P/E ratio. :Because rents are received throughout the year rather than at its end, both the gross and net rental yields calculated by the above are somewhat less than the true rental yields obtained when taking into account the monthly nature of rental payments. * The occupancy rate (opposite: vacancy rate) is the number of occupied housing units divided by the total number of units in a given region (in commercial real estate, usually expressed in terms of area (i.e. in square metres, acres, et cetera) for different grades of buildings). A low occupancy rate means that the market is in a state of oversupply brought about by speculative construction and purchase. In this context, supply-and-demand numbers can be misleading: sales demand exceeds supply, but rent demand does not. = Housing price indices = The Case‚ÄìShiller index 1890‚Äì2016, showing a housing bubble peaking in 2006 Measures of house price are also used in identifying housing bubbles; these are known as house price indices (HPIs). A noted series of HPIs for the United States are the Case‚ÄìShiller indices, devised by American economists Karl Case, Robert J. Shiller, and Allan Weiss. As measured by the Case‚ÄìShiller index, the US experienced a housing bubble peaking in the second quarter of 2006 (2006 Q2). Recent real estate bubbles The crash of the Japanese asset price bubble from 1990 on has been very damaging to the Japanese economy. The crash in 2005 affected Shanghai, China's largest city. , real estate bubbles had existed in the recent past or were widely believed to still exist in many parts of the world. including Argentina, New Zealand, Ireland, Spain, Lebanon, Poland, and Croatia. Then U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in mid-2005 that \\"at a minimum, there's a little 'froth' (in the U.S. housing market) ‚Ä¶ it's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles.\\" The Economist magazine, writing at the same time, went further, saying \\"the worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history\\". In France, the economist Jacques Friggit publishes each year a study called \\"Evolution of the price, value and number of property sales in France since the 19th century\\", showing a high price increase since 2001. Yet, the existence of a real estate bubble in France is discussed by economists. Real estate bubbles are invariably followed by severe price decreases (also known as a house price crash) that can result in many owners holding mortgages that exceed the value of their homes. 11.1 million residential properties, or 23.1% of all U.S. homes, were in negative equity at Dec. 31, 2010. Commercial property values remained around 35% below their mid-2007 peak in the United Kingdom. As a result, banks have become less willing to hold large amounts of property-backed debt, likely a key issue affecting the worldwide recovery in the short term. By 2006, most areas of the world were thought to be in a bubble state, although this hypothesis, based upon the observation of similar patterns in real estate markets of a wide variety of countries, was subject to controversy. Such patterns include those of overvaluation and, by extension, excessive borrowing based on those overvaluations.\\"Headlines in the financial press ranged from ‚ÄúProperty slowdown fuels China fears‚Äù to ‚ÄúChina property correction would be painful, but salutary‚Äù (Financial Times, 2014e, p. 3).

Stricter underwriting standards have limited the pool of potential homebuyers to those who are most qualified and most likely to be able to pay loans back. The demand this time is based more closely on market fundamentals. And the price growth we‚Äôve experienced recently is 'real.' Or 'more real.'\\" Other recent research indicates that mid-level managers in securitized finance did not exhibit awareness of problems in overall housing markets.Wall Street and the Housing Bubble, Princeton University, September 2013 Economist David Stockman believes that a second housing bubble was started in 2012 and still inflating as of February 2013. Housing inventory began to dwindle starting in early 2012 as hedge fund investors and private equity firms purchase single-family homes in hopes of renting them out while waiting for a housing rebound. Due to the policies of QE3, mortgage interest rates have been hovering at an all-time low, causing real estate values to rise. Home prices have risen unnaturally as much as 25% within one year in metropolitan areas like the San Francisco Bay Area and Las Vegas.

Tipperary Redwood Castle (also known as Egan Castle or Caislean Choillte Rua in Irish) is a Norman castle near Lorrha in County Tipperary, Ireland. The castle was built by the Normans around 1200 AD, and was occupied by them until , when the Mac Aodhag√°in (MacEgan, Egan, Keegan) were installed on the lands. As hereditary Brehons or lawyers, the Mac Aodhag√°in clan established a school of learning here, which was patronised by the family for several hundred years. The castle was enlarged and renovated several times, with considerable work from 1350. Aside from the original thick stone walls, the building demonstrates some architectural features common to Irish fortifications of the period (including a murder-hole), and some less common features (including a Sheela na gig). The castle remained under continuous occupation and ownership by the (Mac)Egan families until it was confiscated and burned at the time of the Cromwellian conquest c.1650. Castle gate The site remained in ruin for over 300 years, with only the thick exterior walls standing, until Michael J. Egan, a Mayo lawyer, purchased and renovated the building in 1972.

W. N. Pugin Oscott College admits students for the priesthood from various dioceses of England and Wales, as well as some students from overseas. The first three years of the academic programme are validated by the University of Birmingham as a BA in Fundamental Catholic Theology. Those who complete the six-year programme also obtain a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB) through affiliation with the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Oscott College is also the diocesan centre for the formation of candidates for the permanent diaconate within the Archdiocese of Birmingham. History =Old Oscott= The college was founded in Oscott, in present-day Great Barr, in 1794 for both the training of priests and the education of lay pupils. It developed out of a small mission founded by Fr Andrew Bromwich around 1687. =New Oscott= St Mary's College, 1839 In 1838, the college moved to a new site, which came to be known as New Oscott (and the original site as \\"Old Oscott\\"). The Maryvale Institute remains on the original site. The new building was designed by Augustus Pugin and Joseph Potter at a cost of ¬£40,000. It is grade II* listed. The college quickly became a symbol of the rebirth of the Catholic faith in England and played a prominent part in the life of the Church in the 19th century. In 1889, the college was closed, but reopened the following year as a seminary only. =21st Century= After the closure of St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, Durham, in 2011, many of the dioceses in the province of Liverpool sent their students to Oscott to complete their training. This gave a boost in numbers at the college at a time when vocations seemed to be scarce.UK Vocations Statistics Pope Benedict XVI visited on 19 September 2010 following the beatification, earlier that day in Birmingham's Cofton Park, of Cardinal Newman who stayed at the college in the late 1840s. During his visit to Oscott, Benedict met and had lunch with the Roman Catholic bishops of England, Scotland and Wales. The Oscott visit was the last scheduled event during the four-day 2010 State Visit of Benedict to the UK. The Pope would later depart the UK from Birmingham International Airport.

The Runelords is a series of fantasy novels by American author David Farland of which the first part was published in 1998. In the universe of The Runelords, there exists a unique magical system which relies on the existence of distinct bodily attributes, such as brawn, grace, and wit. These attributes can be transferred from one individual (or animal) to another in a process known as \\"giving an endowment\\". Lords who have taken many endowments become extremely powerful, almost superhuman, and are known as Runelords. Novels of The Runelords =Earth King Series= The Sum of All Men Seeking the hand of the Princess Iome Sylvarresta, Prince Gaborn Val Orden is sidetracked when the Wolf Lord Raj Ahten invades the Kingdom of Heredon, seeking to rule all of Rofehavan. Brotherhood of the Wolf Raj Ahten and the forces of Rofehavan strike an uneasy alliance as they join forces to battle a Reaver invasion at the walled city of Carris. Wizardborn Following the Battle of Carris, Gaborn leads the troops of Rofehavan against the fleeing Reaver horde, while Raj Ahten returns to Indhopal to protect his own kingdom from a separate Reaver invasion. The Lair of Bones Gaborn Val Orden leads an expedition into the heart of the underworld to confront the One True Master of the Reavers, to decide in battle the fate of mankind and of the Earth itself. =Scions of the Earth Series= Sons of the Oak Nine years after the events of The Lair of Bones, Gaborn the Earth King finally succumbs to old age and passes on. In his wake, enemies of the Earth try to take control of the land, and Gaborn's eldest son Fallion, still only a child, must fight to protect his kingdom and his family. Worldbinder The sixth book of The Runelords was released in the US on 21 September 2007. Fallion returns to Mystarria and is tricked into combining his world with another, when he tries to restore a sapling of the 'One True Tree' which has been cursed by Lady Despair. Areth Sul Urstone, the mirror world incarnation of Fallion's father, Gaborn val Orden, is being held captive in the wyrmling lair, with Lady Despair eventually taking human form by using Areth as her host. The Wyrmling Horde The seventh book in the series was released 16 September 2008. Lord/Lady Despair tortures Fallion through many dedicates with a rune of compassion. Both sides vie for possession of the mountains of blood metal available on the combined world. Despair begins to accumulate new and evil accomplices from other worlds. Rhianna saves Fallion and the 'rescue party' by bypassing Despair's new found \\"Earth Sense\\", by not harming any wyrmlings during the rescue. Despair has 'Chosen' Fallion, and knows his whereabouts at all times. Vulgnash the death lord is sent by Despair to retrieve Fallion, and is confronted by the Wizard Sisel, who makes Vulgnash mortal and human rather than killing him. Fallion returns with Vulgnash to Despair in the wyrmling lair. Chaosbound The eighth book in the series was released 13 October 2009. Borenson & Myrrima arrive back from Landesfallen following the binding of the worlds, at Ox Port, where they are hunted by the wyrmlings, but surreptitiously helped and protected by the local wyrmling leader, Crull- maldor, who hopes to aid Borenson/Aaath Ulber in his prophesied destruction of the emperor Zul-Torac, clearing the way for Crull-maldor to replace him as Lord Despair's side. The wight exacts vengeance on Borenson/Aaath Ulber after his successful, endowment aided, destruction of the wyrmling forces and lair, by murdering Myrrima. A Tale of Tales A Tale of Tales has not been released. In 2018, Farland suggested readers buy his writing courses as support so he can finish the series. Legends and history The universe of The Runelords is well fleshed out, populated by diverse beings, with rich backstories that assist the understanding of the events as described in the books. =Daylan Hammer ‚Äì The Sum of All Men= There is a legend about the \\"Sum of All Men\\", a man with so many endowments and so beloved by the people that he became immortal and retained all of his endowments even after the deaths of his Dedicates. The strengths of the people supposedly flowed to him unrestrained, somehow without draining the dedicates themselves of the attributes. The books refer to Daylan of the Black Hammer as the Sum of All Men, although in the sixth novel it is revealed that Daylan is in fact a Bright One from the Netherworld, rather than a mortal man with many endowments. It is also revealed that Daylan has a mere four endowments of Brawn, in stark contrast to the legends which claim he has a huge number. Daylan himself claims to have started these legends, though his purpose for doing so has not been revealed. =The Earth King= Like the Sum of All Men, the Earth King is a legendary figure among all cultures. The first human Earth King, for there have been Earth Kings of many races, was a man named Erden Geboren, who united humanity using wizardly powers granted to him by the god- like force of Earth to protect his followers from the Toth and reavers. The Toth were eliminated, but the reavers survived. Geboren's nation was eventually split up after his death, and the royal families of most human nations are directly descended from his most trusted lieutenants and related to Geboren through intermarriage. It has become common for small, homemade dolls and icons of the Earth King to be placed at doorways during Hostenfest, an annual harvest festival, to invite the power and blessings of the Earth King into one's home. The Earth King is commonly given immense power in magics wielded by the Earth Wardens, the common wizards of the Earth. He can sleep buried under soil and commune with the Earth in his dreams or may be granted the knowledge of previously unknown runes and spells. Earth Kings are also known to have the magical \\"Earth Sight,\\" a gift which they can use to see across long distances or into the minds and souls of other people. Using this Earth Sight, they can judge who is worthy to save, and can Choose people. The Earth Kings sense danger approaching their Chosen, though do not know specifics, and can send telepathic warnings or other messages to their Chosen. The death of a Chosen is very painful to an Earth King. Legends say that Erden Geboren died without a single wound upon his body but with a heart broken from the swift deaths of many of his Chosen. Races and groups The Runelords universe has a number of races and groups: =Duskin= Very little is revealed about the Duskin in the course of the series, though it is known they were great Earth-wizards and craftsmen. The Duskin were smaller than humans but bore a general resemblance to human shape, having the same number of limbs and being bipeds. Duskin dwelt beneath the surface of the earth, but in caverns much closer to the surface then their ancient rivals, the Reavers. =Humans= Humans are the dominant species of the surface world. They are identical to real humans, except they are not the first or only intelligent race to arise in the world. Humanity's survival has been placed at risk many times, just as other dominant species have been eliminated in the past. Humans reside mainly upon one continent, though more exist throughout the world. They are divided principally into the Rofehavanish, the Indhopalese, and the Inkarrans. They have produced wizards of all kinds, while many other species only have one or two different kinds of wizards. Individually, a single human might have slim to no chance of standing against the monstrous might of creatures such as the Reavers. However, in numbers and through the magical granting of endowments, humans have learned to consolidate their strength and stand against other species that could otherwise destroy them. They are also the most technologically advanced of the extant species. =Reavers= Reavers are a massive species of subterranean creatures which bear no resemblance to any surface dwelling creature. Reavers are somewhat like insects, communicating through scents and having various \\"castes\\" which perform different functions within their \\"hives\\", though they do not have a collective intelligence. They are unchallenged masters of the Underworld. Reavers are incredibly hard to kill due to their vast size, armor-like skin and crystalline bones. The best way to slay a Reaver is to attack its brain through the mouth or the \\"sweet triangle\\", an area on the back of the Reaver's head where its bone-plates do not quite meet. =Toth= The Toth are an extinct race of sorcerers that were thought to be in some way related to the Reavers, though they were more vaguely humanoid and significantly smaller. The Toth were an expansionistic race and were slain by King Fallion of Mystarria when he led the massed armies of humanity across the Caroll Sea to the Toth homeland. The only surviving Toth take the form of wights, deadly ghost-like spirits which dwell in dangerous, wild places and bring icy death with their touch. Generally only Toth sorcerers remain as wights, their spirits presumably having been stronger than their non-magical fellows. =Nomen= Nomen are black-coated shaggy creatures that lumber on all fours in preference to an upright gait. They are crafty nocturnal hunters who prefer small packs to seeking prey alone. Their hands are clawed, and their eyes are red and seemingly glow in the dark. Nomen will drop on unwary travelers from a forest canopy rather than attempt a direct confrontation. They use basic weapons, favoring the spear most of all. Nomen can be found in the Dunwood and are said to inhabit the Hest Mountains beyond Inkarra in great numbers. In the distant past, they came north and invaded, but were slaughtered and their numbers greatly reduced. =Frowth Giants= Frowth giants are extremely large, standing roughly twenty feet tall and eight feet wide at the shoulders. They are covered in a matted yellow fur, and their faces are dominated by a long snout. Their huge size and strength makes them useful in labor and in combat. Frowth giants sometimes wear armor, and they carry huge iron-bound staves as weapons. With sharp teeth, they will kill or eat carrion if it is available. They have a limited ability for speech. =Ferrin= Ferrin are small, ratlike humanoids who live across the temperate world. Some live out in the wild, foraging for food and protecting their warrens, while many others live in human cities. Those who live in human cities often filch food and hunt rats. Most consider them a minor nuisance at best and vermin to be exterminated at worst. They are somewhat intelligent, though not as intelligent as humans. They have a very basic language and understand clothing and tools, including simple weapons. =The Days= The Days are an ancient order of historians whose goal is to follow and observe Kings and Runelords in order to record their actions for future generations. Each Days records the events of their charge via a mind link with another of their order, created by exchanging an endowment of Wit with another Days. The Days serve beings known simply as the Time Lords, although little has been discovered about these Time Lords as of yet. While one Days follows their Lord, their counterpart lives in a monastery-type environment in the far north of Orwynne, kept away from anything other than their principal purpose, to compile the life journal of their chosen Runelord. The power of the Days order comes from knowing that at any given time they can find out what is happening to any particular noble at any place in the world. Therefore, should they wish to, the Days could influence events on a kingdom-wide scale. However, their service is completely focused upon observation, with a strict policy of noninterference ‚Äì even in the face of cataclysmic war they would not act to save millions, nor would a Days stop to save a single drowning person. Rumors and legends abound, though, of some Days or another betraying his vows of noninterference and sharing knowledge with his lord. They also seem to use their knowledge to tear down lords who attempt to drive them away, sharing the lord's plans and secrets with his enemies. The Days are easily identifiable by their simple brown robes. Brotherhood of the Wolf. =Knights Equitable= The Knights Equitable are an order of knights and force soldiers who have forsworn their loyalties to their kings and lords. Instead, they organize in a loose brotherhood under a High Marshal, and hold themselves to a general devotion to eliminate Wolf Lords and evil from the world. No man in the Knights Equitable is a \\"lord\\" to another in the order, though they do have ranks, which anyone may advance through by merit, not birth. Skalbairn was the High Marshal of the Knights Equitable through the Earth King series, and as their leader holds as much military power as some kings. They are also known as the Righteous Horde. =Wights= Wights are the spirits of the dead, often human, Duskin, or Toth. Many hide in wild, out-of-the-way places away from the sight of humans. Some, such as the Duskin and human wights of the Dunnwood, are largely harmless. Others, like the Toth wights in the bogs in the south of Mystarria, loathe humans and do not hesitate to attack them. The chill touch of a wight is a slow and painful death. Existence as a wight provides something of a \\"living\\" afterlife upon the world. Many people of Rofehavan, as long as they love the land, may become one of the wights of the Dunnwood upon their death, reunited with lost loved ones. =Netherworld creatures= Several important creatures come from the Netherworld. They are intensely magical beings, of great power far surpassing anything in the normal world. Bright Ones are inhabitants of the Netherworld and are much mightier and wiser than mortal men. Glories are angelic beings of light, air, and fire that occasionally fight alongside humans, whereas Darkling Glories are Glories that serve destruction and evil. Loci are malevolent spirits which can possess the bodies of other beings. Countries The human world of the Runelords is divided up into the three realms of Rofehavan, Inkarra, and Indhopal. Rofehavan, which dominates the northern half of the continent, is most like medieval Europe in culture. Indhopal, which takes up most of the southern half of the continent, is much like the historical Middle East, though with a wide variety of societies in the region. Readers see the least of Inkarra, a land hidden behind the Alcair Mountains to the east of Indhopal and south of Rofehavan. Inkarra is most similar to the Congo region of Africa, with jungles, exotic creatures, and humans that are seen as separate from the others (just as Africans were viewed as separate by both Middle Easterns and Europeans) =Rofehavan= The nations of Rofehavan are as follows: *Alnick *Ashoven *Beldinook ‚Äì ruled by King Lowicker *Eyremoth *Fleeds ‚Äì a nation of plains, known for its fine, fast horses and nomadic clans, though perhaps the poorest nation of Rofehavan *Haversind-by-the-Sea ‚Äì an island nation off the east coast of the mainland, in the Caroll Sea *Heredon ‚Äì ruled by King Jas Laren Sylvarresta and Queen Venetta Moshan Sylvarresta; Heredon steel is some of the best in Rofehavan *Internook ‚Äì an island nation off the north coast of the mainland *Lonnock *Lysle ‚Äì ruled by an upper class of merchant princes who win their station as much through wealth as anything else *Mystarria ‚Äì one of the richest and largest nations of Rofehavan, ruled by King Mandellas Draken Orden; known for its many Water Wizards and for the House of Understanding. *North Crowthen *Orwynne *Seward *South Crowthen ‚Äì ruled by King Anders; *Toom =Indhopal= Indhopal dominates the southwest third of the continent, and much of it is known for its arid deserts. Other parts of Indhopal are rich and lush, covered in tropical rainforests. Raj Ahten has conquered all of Indhopal by the time the Runelords begins. The nations of Indhopal are as follows: *Aven *Bina *Deyazz *Dharmad *Hawat *Kartish ‚Äì the farthest southern nation of Indhopal, known for its extremely rich blood metal mines *Khuram *Linah *Muttaya *Muyyatin *Old Indhopal ‚Äì the mightiest nation of the region, after which the region was named; the first nation Raj Ahten took rulership of *Taif *Tuulistan *Umarish =Inkarra= On maps a united realm, Inkarra is rife with kings great and small who constantly scheme for power and place. The greatest is the Storm King Zandaros, both the High King of Inkarra and perhaps the mightiest human Air Wizard. As High King, all other kings of Inkarra must pay tribute to Zandaros. The Inkarrans despise the Rofehavanish, who they call the Dayborn, considering them to be utter barbarians. The border between Mystarria and Inkarra is a closed one, as some sixty years before, criminals and assassins crept across the border. Three such assassins were captured and executed outright, their bodies sent home as warning. Zandaros protested the executions and insulted the Mystarrians, and so a response was sent by skyrider that if the Inkarrans would not patrol the border and catch their own criminals, Mystarria could not be blamed for doing so themselves. Zandaros's own response to this message was to send the child skyrider's head back in a sack. Ever since, Rofehavanish from Mystarria have been forbidden to enter Inkarra on penalty of death, and Mystarria has forbidden any Inkarrans from ever entering the nation. Most other nations of Rofehavan tolerate Inkarran traders and traveling performers. The Inkarrans call themselves the \\"Night Children\\" in their own language. They are a closely related offshoot of humanity, one that has become nocturnal. Skin and hair is often solid white, as are their \\"ice white\\" eyes, which can see perfectly in near total darkness. There are more than a few halfbreeds amongst the Inkarrans, called kutasarri in their language, who are often shunned because of their \\"Dayborn\\" appearance and night-blind eyes.

Magic The world of the Runelords has two major forms of magic, both based upon runes of power: elemental magic, and endowments. Wizards wield the elemental magics (air, earth, fire, and water), while anyone who knows the proper chants and songs (along with a forcible of blood metal) can use the magic required to grant endowments. =Runes= Most works of magic require the use of runes. These symbols each carry power, some greater than others. Common people can use some of them to minor effect, though they are most powerful when created by wizards. Anyone may draw runes of strength to make a stone keep durable, but those same runes drawn by a wizard will protect a fortress's walls for centuries. =Endowments= The main magical system of the series relies on a system of attributes which are inherent to every living creature. These attributes are transferable to and from both man and animal, so brawn from a dog can be transferred to a man. Once an individual gives an attribute to another, the giver loses that particular attribute until the death of the recipient. Each person can only give one endowment in their lifetime. Endowments include brawn (physical strength), grace (physical dexterity), wit (memory and clearness of thought), metabolism (speed at which the body's processes operate), glamor, voice, stamina, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, talent, will, bloodlust, and pain. Talent and will are more difficult to create and are only known by the Inkarrans. Bloodlust and pain are perverse in nature and were devised by the one true master of evil to strengthen her troops and torture the humans, specifically Fallion. How Endowment works Endowments are transferred with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast of a rare material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, is part of the duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, the facilitator invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The facilitator touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused. Dedicates A dedicate must give up his attribute willingly; the simple act of touching him with a forcible is not enough. However, unscrupulous Runelords can threaten a potential dedicate's friends and family to force cooperation. Dedicates are normally selected from individuals whose attributes are strong; one selects a strong man to dedicate his brawn, a person with excellent vision to dedicate sight, and so forth. Special characteristics of certain Endowments * Individuals must be careful that their physical endowments, such as brawn and stamina, are similar in number, or the borrowed brawn may literally tear the body apart (for example). This could happen to individuals who choose poorly in the balance of endowments or who have only certain forcibles available, but the more usual cause is the death of one or more dedicates, resulting in the loss of their attributes. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as \\"warriors of unfortunate proportion.\\" * Individuals endowed with metabolism move faster than ordinary men, but they pay a price: they age at the same proportion. (A dedicate who provides metabolism sleeps until his lord dies, not aging at all. A dedicate who gives up metabolism requires virtually no caring for at all, other than a cat or rat terrier in the vicinity to ensure that the mice don't eat the flesh of the comatose dedicate. * Individuals with large numbers of glamor and voice endowments can become so beautiful and so persuasive that men will obey them even when they know rationally that it is a poor idea. * Two individuals who endow each other with wit become mentally linked. This is the basis of the Days' power. An individual endowed with wit learns much faster and remembers more than other men, but if his dedicates die much of this knowledge disappears. If he later receives additional endowments of wit, he must relearn what he once knew. Vectoring Endowments A dedicate can vector endowments. That is, he can receive endowments of one particular variety from several dedicates, becoming extremely well endowed. Then he can himself dedicate that same endowment to another, who benefits from the endowment supplied by his dedicate and those supplied by all of that individual's dedicates. Each endowment requires space on the skin for the rune inscribed by the forcible; Runelords who intend to acquire hundreds of endowments (such as Raj Ahten) must vector them because there isn't sufficient room on their bodies otherwise.

He was a grandson of George Mason and represented the Confederate States of America as appointed commissioner of the Confederacy to the United Kingdom and France between 1861 and 1865, during the American Civil War. In November 1861, Mason was among those captured by Federal troops during the Trent Affair while he was on a mission to England. Early life He was born on Analostan Island, now Theodore Roosevelt Island, in the District of Columbia. He was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania (1818) and received a law degree from the College of William & Mary (1820). Political career He practiced law in Virginia and was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and a member of the House of Delegates. He was elected to the Twenty-fifth United States Congress in 1836 as a Jackson Democrat. In 1847, he was elected to the Senate after the death of Isaac S. Pennybacker, and he was re-elected in 1850 and 1856. Mason famously read aloud the dying Senator John C. Calhoun's final speech to the Senate, on March 4, 1850, which warned of disunion and dire consequences if the North did not permanently guarantee the South equal representation in Congress. He also complained of personal liberty laws: \\"Although the loss of property is felt, the loss of honor is felt still more.\\"James M. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (New York: Bantam Books, 1989), p. 79. Mason and negroes Mason was not only a white supremacist‚Äîmost white Southerners and many Northerners were‚Äî, he believed that negroe were \\"the great curse of the country\\". Giving Blacks the vote particularly offended him; it was, he thought, the rule of the mob and the \\"end of the republic.\\" Mason wrote (drafted) the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, arguably the most hated and openly evaded Federal legislation in U.S. history. Mason also was the chair and wrote the report of the ad-hoc Senate committee that investigated John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. He also wrote its report, informally known as the Mason Report. Mason was President pro tempore of the Senate in 1857 but was expelled from the Senate in 1861 for support of the Confederate States. While he was traveling to his new post as Confederate envoy to Britain and France on the British mail steamer RMS Trent, the ship was stopped by USS San Jacinto on November 8, 1861. Mason and John Slidell were confined in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, precipitating the Trent Affair, which threatened to bring Britain into open war with the United States. The US public erupted with a huge display of triumphalism at this dramatic capture. Even the cool-headed Lincoln was swept along in the celebratory spirit, but when he and his cabinet studied the likely consequences of a war with Britain, their enthusiasm waned. After some careful diplomatic exchanges, they admitted that the capture had been conducted contrary to maritime law and that private citizens could not be classified as \\"enemy despatches.\\" Slidell and Mason were released, and war was averted. The two diplomats set sail for England again on January 1, 1862. Mason represented the Confederacy there until April 1865. One of his first acts in London was to raise the issue of Union blockades. When Union troops took Winchester, Virginia, because of Mason's role at the center of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, they destroyed Mason's house. They did so so thoroughly that \\"from turret to foundation stone, not one stone remains upon another; the negro houses, the out-buildings, the fences are all gone, and even the trees are many of them girdled\\". According to Mason, the house was \\"obliterated\\". He never lived in Winchester again. Later life Until 1868 he lived in Canada, and he then returned to the Clarens Estate near Alexandria, Virginia. He died at Clarens in 1871. He was interred in the churchyard of Christ Church (Alexandria, Virginia). James M.

His posts as governor included Governor of the British Settlements in West Africa, Governor of Saint Vincent, Governor of South Australia, Governor of Nova Scotia and Governor of Hong Kong. Several places around the world are named for him including MacDonnell Road in Hong Kong; and, the MacDonnell Ranges and Sir Richard Peninsula in Australia. Early life Richard Graves MacDonnell was born in Dublin, 8 September 1814, the second son of Richard MacDonnell, the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and Jane Graves (1793‚Äì1882), second daughter of Richard Graves, Dean of Ardagh. He was a nephew of Robert James Graves and the brother of Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell. His first cousins included Lady Valentine Blake of Menlough, Sir William Collis Meredith, Edmund Allen Meredith, John Dawson Mayne and Francis Brinkley. MacDonnell entered Trinity College Dublin in 1830, was elected a scholar in 1833, and graduated B.A. (1835), M.A., (1836), LL.B., (1845), and LL.D.., (1862) Governor in Gambia and the West Indies MacDonnell was called to the Irish bar in 1838, and to the English bar, at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn, 25 January 1841. On 20 July 1843, he was appointed to the new post of Chief Justice of the Gambia. After four years there, amidst long breaks for his health travelling through the United States and Canada, he intended to hand in his resignation to Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey and resume practice at the English bar. But, on 1 October 1847, Grey persuaded him otherwise and appointed him Governor of the British settlements in Gambia, a post he held for a further four years. While in Gambia, MacDonnell (a cousin of the explorers Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton and Admiral Richard Charles Mayne) spent much of his time indulging his passion for exploration, and organising punitive campaigns against unruly native tribes. His expeditions opened up the interior of Africa from the Gambia River to the Senegal River. The military expeditions which he accompanied against native tribes who had long oppressed the traders of the river were a success and extended the limits of British commerce in the region. On one visit to a native king an ambush was laid for him, and he narrowly avoided being assassinated. In return, the British government sent four hundred men to inflict a summary chastisement, with MacDonnell acting as Captain of one of the volunteer companies. In 1852, (when he was also gazetted Companion of the Order of the Bath) he was nominated as Lieutenant Governor of St. Lucia, but without taking up the post he was sent, 10 January 1853, to become administrator and Captain General of the island of St. Vincent. He was Lieutenant General of St Vincent from 1853 to 1854. Governor of South Australia Described as a 'dominant personality' and having gained a reputation for forthrightness and intolerance, MacDonnell was appointed the sixth Governor of South Australia, arriving 9 June 1855, and taking over from Boyle Travers Finniss who had been acting since the departure of Sir Henry Young. Shortly before leaving for Australia, in 1856 he was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George by Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. Soon after his arrival in Australia, MacDonnell was involved in heated debate over the composition of the legislature; MacDonnell favoured a single chamber while the majority of colonists preferred a two- house system, which brought him the support of the conservatives, but united the liberals and radicals against him. Eventually a two-house system prevailed, although the Upper House had a property franchise. Difficulties between MacDonnell and his officials led to several changes of government. He extended railway and telegraph communications within the colony and opened up valuable copper mines on the Yorke Peninsula, while increasing the progress in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. MacDonnell showed little concern for the Australian working class, claiming that charity fostered sloth and pauperism. He was particularly impressed with the settlers from Germany, and he predicted that the colony had a great future for producing wine. In his seven-year term the acreage under wheat doubled in South Australia and he argued that farmers with capital would succeed as long as their methods did not rob the soil. MacDonnell's passion for exploration greatly aided in opening up the interior of Australia, in particular the Murray River, and he developed many of the natural resources of the colony. He travelled widely in the colony and in 1859 led a small party to investigate country around the northern lakes and claypans, riding 1800 miles (2897 km) in three months. He maintained that Charles Sturt and Edward John Eyre were overrated as explorers as they seemed \\"generally to have a knack of getting into the most dismal places and finding barrenness from Dan to Beersheba\\". He instead urged the colonists to support the efforts of John McDouall Stuart to cross the continent. MacDonnell was regarded in Australia as both 'powerful and hospitable'. He was an enthusiastic member of local rifle and archery clubs and keenly interested in the volunteer defence movement. He also identified himself with most of the literary, artistic and philanthropic organizations. He saw himself as a leader and innovator, and though genial, at times his bustling energy dismayed Adelaide society. As a patron of South Australian culture he encouraged students who could not travel abroad to continue their post-primary schooling, and with his customary dash personally examined candidates and donated prizes, but his plan collapsed after he left the colony. He left South Australia, 4 March 1862, for a holiday in Ireland before taking up his next post. Governor of Nova Scotia On the recommendation of his predecessor, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby, MacDonnell was appointed Governor of Nova Scotia from 28 May 1864, until October 1865, taking up residence at Government House (Nova Scotia). His arrival coincided with the Confederation of Canada which he made no secret of being in opposition to, and he refused to become a tool of either the British Colonial Secretary or the Governor General of Canada, telling Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, \\"You shall not make a mayor of me, I can tell you!\\" Confederation went ahead, making MacDonnell's tenure in Nova Scotia a short one. He was succeeded by one of Nova Scotia's most distinguished sons, General Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Kars. Governor of Hong Kong On 19 October 1865, MacDonnell was appointed as the sixth Governor of Hong Kong, a position in which he served until 1872. During his tenure, MacDonnell developed Victoria Peak, which would eventually become the premier residential quarters in Hong Kong, accessible only to rich European merchants. MacDonnell also ordered the construction of a hospital which catered to the needs of the local Chinese population. In addition, he legalised gambling in Hong Kong which led to social problems and was later made illegal once again. In 1871 he was gazetted K.C.M.G. Finally, MacDonnell's administration was marred by a huge budget deficit, which resulted in the government asking the HSBC for a financial aid package. The administration was also damaged by the actions of the Canton Customs agency, who patrolled the waters off Hong Kong and boarded ships to search for smuggled goods. This was called by Hong Kong's British merchant community a blockade, and affected Hong Kong's economy for the next 20 years. Marriage and retirement The grave of Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, Kensal Green Cemetery In 1847, MacDonnell married Blanche Ann, daughter of Francis Skurray of Beckington, Somerset, who lived at Stanhope Place, Hyde Park and Percy Cross Lodge, Fulham, before retiring to 5 Brunswick Square, Brighton. Sir Richard and Lady MacDonnell lived near Hyde Park in London and after his retirement in 1872 they spent much time in Italy and France, dying at Hy√®res, 5 February 1881. They are buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, on the southern side. They died without children. Publications with his involvement * The Church of the Future, an address by the Rev.

Plot Through first-person narration, the reader is immersed at the start of the story in the drab life that people live on North Richmond Street, which seems to be illuminated only by the verve and imagination of the children who, despite the growing darkness that comes during the winter months, insist on playing \\"until [their] bodies glowed.\\" Even though the conditions of this neighbourhood leave much to be desired, the children's play is infused with their almost magical way of perceiving the world, which the narrator dutifully conveys to the reader: But though these boys \\"career\\" around the neighbourhood in a very childlike way, they are also aware of and interested in the adult world, as represented by their spying on the narrator's uncle as he comes home from work and, more importantly, on Mangan's sister, whose dress ‚Äúswung as she moved‚Äù and whose ‚Äúsoft rope of hair tossed from side to side.‚Äù These boys are on the brink of sexual awareness and, awed by the mystery of another sex, are hungry for knowledge. On one rainy evening, the boy secludes himself in a soundless, dark drawing-room and gives his feelings for her full release: \\"I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: O love! O love! many times.\\" This scene is the culmination of the narrator's increasingly romantic idealization of Mangan's sister. By the time he actually speaks to her, he has built up such an unrealistic idea of her that he can barely put sentences together: ‚ÄúWhen she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me if I was going to Araby. I forget whether I answered yes or no.‚Äù But the narrator recovers splendidly: when Mangan's sister dolefully states that she will not be able to go to Araby, he gallantly offers to bring something back for her. The narrator now cannot wait to go to the Araby bazaar and procure for his beloved some grand gift that will endear him to her. And though his aunt frets, hoping that it is not ‚Äúsome Freemason affair,‚Äù and though his uncle, perhaps intoxicated, perhaps stingy, arrives so late from work and equivocates so much that he almost keeps the narrator from being able to go, the intrepid yet frustrated narrator heads out of the house, tightly clenching a florin, in spite of the late hour, toward the bazaar. But the Araby market turns out not to be the most fantastic place he had hoped it would be. It is late; most of the stalls are closed. The only sound is \\"the fall of the coins\\" as men count their money. Worst of all, however, is the vision of sexuality‚Äîof his future‚Äîthat he receives when he stops at one of the few remaining open stalls. The young woman minding the stall is engaged in a conversation with two young men. Though he is potentially a customer, she only grudgingly and briefly waits on him before returning to her frivolous conversation. His idealized vision of Araby is destroyed, along with his idealized vision of Mangan's sister‚Äîand of love. With shame and anger rising within him, he is alone in Araby. Themes \\"Araby\\" touches on a great number of themes: * coming of age * meeting of imagination with reality * the life of the mind versus poverty (both physical and intellectual) * the consequences of idealization * the Catholic Church's influence to make Dublin a place of asceticism where desire and sensuality are seen as immoralCoulthard, A.R. \\"Joyce's Araby.\\" Explicator 52.2 (1994): 97. Academic Search Premier. Web. 23 Aug. 2012. * the pain that often comes when one encounters love in reality instead of its elevated form * paralysis These themes build on one another entirely through the thoughts of the young boy, who is portrayed by the first- person narrator, who writes from memory. Romantic elements \\"Araby\\" contains many themes and traits common to Joyce in general and Dubliners in particular. As with many of the stories in the collection, \\"Araby\\" involves a character going on a journey, the end result of which is fruitless, and ends with the character going back to where he came from. \\"Eveline\\" is just one other story in Dubliners to feature a circular journey in this manner. Also, the narrator lives with his aunt and uncle, although his uncle appears to be a portrait of Joyce's father, and may be seen as a prototype for Simon Dedalus of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Ulysses. The scorn the narrator has for his uncle is certainly consistent with the scorn Joyce showed for his father, and the lack of \\"good\\" parents is pertinent. In \\"The Structure of Araby,\\" Jerome Mandel notes the shared plot archetypes between ‚ÄúAraby‚Äù and traditional medieval romantic literature, positing that Joyce deliberately ‚Äústructured with rigorous precision upon a paradigm of medieval romance.‚ÄùChristopher Wang, \\"The Constant Vanity in Araby.\\" Accessed 4.11.2013.

He served U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford in the White House in various positions from 1969 to 1976, including Counselor to the President, acting Special Counsel to Nixon for the last two years of his presidency, and U.S. Ambassador to the Third Committee at the United Nations. Life and career Garment was born in Brooklyn, New York. In 1949, he graduated from Brooklyn Law School and joined the law firm of Mudge, Stern, Baldwin, and Todd. He became the head of litigation and a partner in the late fifties. (Later the firm would be called Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander.) Garment met Richard Nixon when the politician joined the firm in 1963. He assisted with Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. In 1969, Garment became a part of Nixon's White House staff as special consultant to the president. He advised the president and worked on various special projects‚Äîparticularly in the areas of civil and human rights, Indian affairs, and the arts. Garment was the author of two books: the autobiography Crazy Rhythm: From Brooklyn and Jazz to Nixon's White House, Watergate, and Beyond, and In Search of Deep Throat: The Greatest Political Mystery of Our Time. Published in 2000, the latter book supported the theory that Deep Throat was John Sears. Before Deep Throat's identity was revealed in 2005 as being former FBI Acting Associate Director W. Mark Felt, Garment himself was a suspect. Felt was listed as a possible Deep Throat in the book (as are many others), but was dismissed by Garment because the author believed the secret source had to have strong White House connections. He was mistaken in his selection of Sears, who told Garment explicitly that he was not Deep Throat. To prove his argument, Sears admitted that he was an anonymous source for Carl Bernstein, but Garment still didn't believe Sears, a longtime friend, was being truthful about not being Deep Throat. Garment had a long association with the arts, starting with his early career as a jazz saxophonist with Woody Herman's band playing with Alan Greenspan before he entered law school. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the board of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. More recently, he was one of the founders of the Jazz Museum in Harlem. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2005 as an arts advocate and patron. Tim Russert credited Leonard Garment with getting him into the news business as Garment had a friend at NBC News who was looking to rebuild their news division. Garment and Russert had previously worked together in 1976 during the U.S. Senate election of Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Garment was a close associate of I. Lewis (\\"Scooter\\") Libby, as law partners, at Dechert, Price & Rhoads. Garment, who had been ill, died July 13, 2013, at his Manhattan home. He was 89.

Situated in the Dublin suburb of Inchicore, it is the home ground of League of Ireland side St Patrick's Athletic F.C. (also known as St Pat's). The area where the ground now stands was formerly used as a recreational area by the British Army, who were stationed at the nearby Richmond Barracks, both named after Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond the barracks having since been demolished. History After the creation of the Irish Free State, and therefore the removal of the British Army, the ground lay idle for 3 years before League of Ireland club Brideville began using the ground in 1925. In 1930 Brideville were forced to move to Harolds Cross Greyhound Stadium to accommodate St Patrick's Athletic moving in. St. Pats continues to use and develop the ground until 1951 when they entered the League of Ireland. The league deemed the ground unsuitable and St. Pats were forced to use a variety of grounds in Dublin as they fought to upgrade Richmond Park. In 1960, after serious development, the ground played host to St Pats first home league game in Inchicore. The ground closed for redevelopment in May 1989, however due to St Pats hitting financially difficulties they did not return until 5 December 1993. The ground lies behind a row of terraced housing in a natural valley and is often used for Republic of Ireland underage and women's teams. It staged the League of Ireland Cup final in 1982 and 2003. It has played host to a two Leinster Senior Cup finals, as well as many junior and intermediate finals. In 2001, 2002, 2003 and part of 2004 Shamrock Rovers played their home games in Richmond Park as tenants of St. Pats. In 2005, Dublin City played the first 10 games of their season in the ground, under a similar arrangement. Richmond Park is usually used by non-league clubs in surrounding areas when they qualify for the FAI Cup. It staged its first European game in July 1996 when Slovan Bratislava visited in a 1996-97 UEFA Cup tie.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1996/0719/Pg019.html#Ar01900:5881195AC12E5161E65391FB69B2556AD263 In 2005, the board of St. Patrick's Athletic F.C. spoke to their fans about a potential move to a new municipal stadium in Tallaght where they would share with Shamrock Rovers. Outraged by this, the club's fans revolted and a pressure group called 'Pats for Richmond' was set up to mobilise and organise opposition to the plan. In July 2006, St. Pats board of directors gave a clear indication of staying put by purchasing local pub Richmond House (also known as McDowells) in order to give the club's fans a social base. In 2006 the club qualified for Europe for the first time since 2002 via the 2006 FAI Cup Final and with the club needing a bigger seating capacity to play in the UEFA Cup, the grass bank behind the Inchicore End goal was dug up and levelled out with concrete and a new temporary stand was built made up of a metal frame and wooden boards. In 2011, at the UEFA Europa League clash between Pats and √çBV of Iceland, a supporter fell through one of the wooden boards while celebrating a goal. This led to the top half of the stand being closed for the next round against Shakhter Karagandy from Kazakhstan and the stand being closed entirely for the remainder of the 2011 season. Before the start of the 2012 season, any wooden boards that were deemed dangerous were swapped with safe ones from the top half of the stand that remained closed, and the bottom half of the stand was reopened for the Saints 5-1 hammering of Shamrock Rovers and remained open for the rest of the season. There was only two games that were an exception to the stand being open, the Europa League game, once again against √çBV, when the UEFA delegate deemed the stand unsafe to use for supporters and the next round of the Europa League against Bosnian side ≈†iroki Brijeg when once again the UEFA delegate deemed the stand unsafe, but his decision was overruled by An Garda S√≠och√°na due to overcrowding in the Main Stand as a result of the tickets being oversold. Midway through the 2013 season, the St.Pat's Supporters Club, the Patron Saints, donated ‚Ç¨50,000 to the club for the stand to be dismantled and rebuilt using metal flooring instead of wooden. The first time the new stand was used was a sold out fixture against Lithuanian side ≈Ωalgiris in the UEFA Europe League on 11 July 2013. the stand was officially opened on 27 July 2013 in front of Supporters, Players and Management and given the official name of 'The Patrons' Stand'.Club News : Patrons' Stand Open! On 11 April 2018, St Patrick's Athletic announced plans to leave their Richmond Park home in favour of a move across the road to the St Michael's Estate site, with plans to create a 12,000 seater state of the art stadium and shopping facility with the working name of the Richmond Arena, hoping to be ready to play in by 2022 pending Dublin City Council's decision on the site and planning permission being granted.https://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=7783https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2018/0411/953609-st- pats-unveil-proposal-for-new-12-000-seater-stadium/ Facilities The main stand seats 1,800 people. Behind one goal, at the Inchicore end, the space was constructed into a new uncovered stand in time for the 2007 UEFA Cup campaign of St Patrick's Athletic F.C. This stand seats 1,000 and is known as the West (or 'New') Stand. The hardcore St. Pat's supporters have traditionally gathered at the other end, in the 'Shed End', though in more recent times the Shed has housed the away supporters while the more vocal Pat's fans have moved to the main stand. Although known locally as the \\"Shed End\\" the official name is the John Minnock stand, as it was financed with money received from his transfer to Charlton Athletic. It was originally a fully covered terrace, before half the roof was removed in the early 2000s and the other half in early 2020, leaving it as an uncovered terrace.https://www.the42.ie/the-shed- st-patricks- athletic-4998761-Feb2020/https://www.irishmirror.ie/sport/soccer/soccer- news/st-pats-shed-end-no-21437778 The camac terrace, across from the main stand, is used by home fans, and named after the river that runs behind it. The Camac holds the ground's TV gantry. Richmond Park on matchnight Other uses Richmond Park hosted Ireland's first ever outdoor rock festival on 4 September 1970. Headlined by Mungo Jerry, the lineup also featured one of the earliest performances of the then recently formed Thin Lizzy.

(n.d). Ocean Regions: Blue Water - Characteristics. Available: . Last accessed 15 May 2014.Rizk, F. (n.d). MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. Available: . Last accessed 15 May 2014. From the point of view of marine biology it forms a relatively stable and well-illuminated environment for marine life, from plankton up to large fish and corals, while physical oceanography sees it as where the oceanic system interacts with the coast.  Definition (marine biology), context, extra terminology  In marine biology, the neritic zone, also called coastal waters, the coastal ocean or the sublittoral zone, refers to that zone of the ocean where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the photic zone. It extends from the low tide mark to the edge of the continental shelf, with a relatively shallow depth extending to about 200 meters (660 feet). Above the neritic zone lie the intertidal (or eulittoral) and supralittoral zones; below it the continental slope begins, descending from the continental shelf to the abyssal plain and the pelagic zone. Within the neritic, marine biologists also identify the following: * The infralittoral zone is the algal-dominated zone down to around five metres below the low water mark. * The circalittoral zone is the region beyond the infralittoral, which is dominated by sessile animals such as oysters. * The subtidal zone is the region of the neritic zone which is below the intertidal zone, therefore never exposed to the atmosphere.  Physical characteristics  The neritic zone is covered with generally well- oxygenated water, receives plenty of sunlight, is relatively stable temperature, has low water pressure and stable salinity levels, making it highly suitable for photosynthetic life. There are several different areas or zones in the ocean. The area along the bottom of any body of water from the shore to the deepest abyss is called the benthic zone. It is where decomposed floral and faunal debris (also known as ocean 'snow') has settled to form a sediment layer in which various plants can grow. All photosynthetic life needs light to grow and how far out into the ocean light can still penetrate through the water column to the floor or benthic zone is what defines the neretic zone. That photic zone, or area where light can penetrate through the water column, is usually above ~100 meters (~328 feet). Some coastal areas have a long area of shallow water that extends far out beyond the landmass into the water and others, for example islands that have formed from ancient volcanos where the 'shelf' or edge of the land mass is very steep, have a very short neretic zone.  Life forms  The above characteristics make the neritic zone the location of the majority of sea life.Office of Naval Research The result is high primary production by photosynthetic life such as phytoplankton and floating sargassum; zooplankton, free-floating creatures ranging from microscopic foraminiferans to small fish and shrimp, feed on the phytoplankton (and one another); both trophic levels in turn form the base of the food chain (or, more properly, web) that supports most of the world's great wild fisheries. Corals are also mostly found in the neritic zone, where they are more common than in the intertidal zone as they have less change to deal with.  Definition (physical oceanography)  In physical oceanography, the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, internal waves, river outflows and ocean fronts. As in marine biology, this zone typically extends to the edge of the continental shelf.

The college, named after Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Justice and lawyer for the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, emphasizes \\"scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of [one's] role in society.\\" Marshall College's general education requirements emphasize the culture of community involvement and multiculturalism; accordingly Marshall houses the minors in Public Service and Film Studies for the campus. Significant academic programs and departments have come out of the college over many decades: Communication, Ethnic Studies, Third World Studies, African American Studies, Urban Studies & Planning, and Education Studies. Founded as Third College in 1970 amid the student activism of the period, TMC's original aim was to help students understand their own community through a critical examination of diversity and community in the United States. Marshall College's required writing program is called Dimensions of Culture (DOC), and is a 3 quarter (1 year) sequence that explores race, identity, imagination, tradition, and the law in the United States. During President Obama's administration, the White House honored UC San Diego and Marshall College's Public Service minor and charter school outreach as exemplary community service institutions serving the United States.http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/president_obamas_community_service_honor_roll_commends_uc_san_diegos_commit Early history In November 1965, the College III Preliminary Planning Committee released the first substantial report on what form UCSD's third college would take. The committee, comprising faculty members George Backus, Henry Booker, Gabriel Jackson, C.D. Keeling, and committee chair Andrew Wright, suggested that College III should focus itself on history and theory. The Wright Committee report suggested that the college have a muse‚Äînamely Clio, the Greek muse of history. History was chosen by the committee because it mixed humanism with science‚ÄîCollege III would be a sort of \\"common ground\\" between the science of Revelle and the humanities of Muir. In a quiet act of rebelliousness (or perhaps it was just individuality), the committee planned that College III students would only have to take three courses per quarter to graduate in four years, as opposed to the four it took at the other UCSD colleges. Citing the three-course \\"full load\\" at UC Santa Cruz, the committee suggested that taking four courses in one quarter would \\"make the students ride off in all directions,\\" and that three-in depth courses would be preferable. The final note of the Wright Committee report described what the committee felt was needed in a College III Provost \\"a paragon of intellectual vitality, scholarly accomplishment, and administrative talent... sympathetic with the aims of College III, but independent enough... to be able to shape the College in important ways.\\" They asked that a provost be appointed as soon as possible. By 1967, College III had found its first provost, Armin Rappaport, a history professor at U.C. Berkeley. It was appropriate that the provost of a college with Clio as its muse would be a historian, and Rappaport was that. By the time May rolled around, College III was now \\"Third College.\\" However, with the swirling political changes of the late 1960s, the college of Clio and Rappaport was never to be. Once the controversy and battles among students, faculty, and administration commenced‚Äîfeaturing lively figures such as Herbert Schiller, Herbert Marcuse, and Angela Davis‚Äîthe future of Third College would be in a turmoil that didn't fully clear until it finally received its official name, Thurgood Marshall College, in 1993. Chancellor William J. McGill persuaded Dr. Joseph Watson to become the first operational provost of Third College during this very turbulent time in 1970. Provost Watson's term lasted eleven years as he then assumed a higher campus position as Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Professor Faustina Sol√≠s then followed as the second college administrator and was also the university's first Latina provost. She served in that capacity from 1981 to 1988. Sol√≠s established public health coursework for undergraduates and medical students, following years of social work and health care for under-served populations. She was honored in 1990 when Thurgood Marshall Lecture Hall was renamed the Faustina F. Sol√≠s Hall. Student activism =Naming controversy= Student Activists from Third College At its inception, students pushed for the new college to be named \\"Lumumba-Zapata College\\" in honor of the legendary twentieth century revolutionaries Patrice Lumumba and Emiliano Zapata. Unable to get approval for this name from UC Administration, the college was renamed Third College. This name did also inspire the idea that the student body would be one-third white students, one-third black students, and one-third definable minority students. Third College took up much of the activism that the campus was lacking, and the naming controversy was a catalyst for this movement. However, UCSD failed to attract enough black students for this plan to reach fruition and the UC Regents would not allow large scale deviation from the University of California's admission guidelines. In the early 1990s, an attempt was made to name the college after Martin Luther King Jr., but failed when UCSD students objected to naming the college after someone who was charged with plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation. More to the point, King's family announced that they would rather see a full-fledged King College built in the South, and preferably in Atlanta. In 1993 UCSD's Third College finally received its official name in honor of the famous lawyer and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Before becoming the first African American Supreme Court Justice, Marshall argued the 1954 landmark civil rights case Brown v. Board of Education. Justice Marshall was widely known and recognized for his historic contributions to American life and dedication to breaking down barriers to education, civil rights, freedom of speech, women's rights, and the right to privacy. Today Thurgood Marshall College continues to honor the legacy of its namesake by promoting a curriculum and environment that empowers students to become both scholars and citizens. =DOC controversy= In the early 1990s, Thurgood Marshall College created a core freshman writing program that provided a critical examination of identity and diversity in American culture. The intellectual program was inspired by the University of Chicago and Columbia University's freshman humanities programs. The program, Dimensions of Culture (DOC), periodically generated heated debates among students, families, and alumni, based on difficult political issues. In the spring of 2007, a new curriculum controversy arose pertaining to DOC as students at TMC began protesting against the administrators of the college. The Lumumba-Zapata Coalition (which had resurfaced with the addition of graduate students) along with other students claimed that DOC had lost some of its original messages, protesting against what they termed a \\"new and diluted\\" core writing requirement with a decreased focus on race and the ethnic significance of the individual within society. The protests, including picketing, began with the controversial non-renewal of two DOC Teaching Assistants‚Äô contracts for the subsequent year. Others believed that the coalition was pushing an agenda of political indoctrination that conflicted with the academic goals of the Dimensions of Culture Program and the sensibility of a science oriented campus. The protests had mixed effects. In response to the complaints in regards to the curriculum a new committee was set up to review and change the curriculum accordingly with an emphasis on hiring tenured faculty to teach DOC. Student positions with voting rights were included on the permanent committee so an equitable curriculum will be created reflecting full community input from both students and faculty. Thurgood Marshall College Student Council (TMCSC) issued a report recommending that DOC have an upper division course which also sparked the public service course. In August 2009, Co-Director of the DOC Program, Robert Horwitz stated, \\"Various criticisms were leveled at DOC in the last few years, and faculty and student investigations concluded that changes needed to be made. Those changes have been implemented and have resulted in a new DOC.‚Äù http://www.osti.gov/eprints/topicpages/documents/record/076/1710510.html College programs =Minors= Peterson Hall, one of Marshall's lecture halls Thurgood Marshall College has created more academic departments and programs than any other college at UCSD, including Third World Studies, Ethnic Studies, Education Studies, African American Studies Minor, and Urban Studies and Planning. TMC is now home to two UCSD Minors: the Public Service Minor and the Film Studies Minor. The Public Service Minor encourages students to understand the history and practices of public service and to work towards the development of civic skills. Those skills and practices are essential cornerstones of participation in a democratic society regardless of one's chosen profession. The coursework for the minor emphasizes the history and emergence of the non-profit sector as a national institution distinct from the private and public spheres. The practicum aspects of the minor couples with the traditional academic work encourages students to see the connection between the deeds of charitable service and the historic worth of citizens participation in the common public franchise. The Film Studies Minor provides students an exciting opportunity to examine the many facets of American and International cinema. Students interested in exploring cinema as a multidimensional art medium will engage in the analysis of cinematic works of various forms. Study of film genres, history, theories, directors, cultural perspectives and more allow students to gain a robust understanding of cinema as a historical and contemporary means of expression. The interdisciplinary nature of the minor provides investigation of cinematic art through its connection to related fields such as Communication, Literature, Sociology and Visual Arts. Students pursuing the Film Studies Minor exhibit a wide range of interests; from those who plan graduate study in film to those who simply wish to understand better this powerful and influential medium. =Morehouse/Spelman/Xavier Student Exchange Program= The Morehouse/Spelman Student Exchange Program was officially launched in the fall quarter of 1989. This formal exchange program with two distinguished Historically Black Colleges was developed by Thurgood Marshall College and is open to all UCSD undergraduates. Morehouse College and Spelman College are both located in Atlanta, Georgia. The purpose of the program is to provide a unique opportunity for students to live and study at important institutions of higher learning that are significantly different from the social and educational environment typical of California state colleges and universities. Similarly, the exchange students coming to UCSD from Morehouse and Spelman will have an opportunity to experience an exciting and very different educational environment. Xavier University in New Orleans became the third historic Black college to have this exchange with Marshall College in 2016. =Marshall partnership schools= Then Thurgood Marshall College Provost Cecil Lytle and Sociology Professor Bud Mehan were instrumental in founding the Preuss School at UCSD, which opened in 1999 on campus despite strong opposition. The project was seen by faculty as a deviation from UC San Diego's focus on science and medicine. However, providing the impetus for the founding of The Preuss School reflected the social justice oriented mission of Marshall College. Between 2007 and 2012 Preuss has consistently been listed among the top 50 American high schools by both Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report. After Preuss was established successfully, the idea and structure of the UCSD-supported charter school model was expanded to Gompers Preparatory Academy. Based on educational theories, the successes of Preuss should be able to be recreated in a different environment, which was why Gompers was selected. Gompers was historically one of the most dangerous and low performing schools in the district, and yet has been transformed into an academically rigorous school with 100% graduation rate with the transition to the charter school model.http://www.gompersprep.org/about-gpa/ The College maintains strong links to both charter schools by providing them with hundreds of undergraduate tutors and mentors every year from all six colleges. In addition, the College's Provost is a Preuss School Board Member. =Artist in residence= The artist-in-residence program, begun in 2006, brings to campus leading performers and visual artists from San Diego and Southern California to UC San Diego. Each artist is featured for one year and given the opportunity to develop new showcase work, which often goes on to fuller production off campus. Marshall College is the first college at UCSD to commission public art on campus, and has contributed in the creation of a vibrant campus community. Allan Havis, a professor from the Theatre Department, launched these programs during his term as college provost from 2006 to 2016. Student life =Student involvement= Marshall College is home to an eclectic mix of student-led organizations, programs to facilitate students' success, and opportunities to give back to the Marshall community.

The M-84 entered service with the Yugoslav People's Army in 1984. The improved M-84A version entered service a few years later. Other variants where introduced later, most of them are modernization packages. =Production in Yugoslavia= There were about 240 Yugoslav factories which directly participated in the production of the M-84 and about 1,000 others which participated indirectly.http://www.srpskioklop.paluba.info/m84/proizvidacim84.htm.

It is very similar to the Russian T-90S, both in appearance and in capability. Latest prototype version from Serbia M-84AS1 unveiled in 2017. has new fire control system with domestic laser and radar warning system, RCWS 12.7mm and soft active protection suite with new version of domestic reactive armor - ERA, later modified prototype of same tank unveiled in 2020 has better shaped ERA M19 reactive armour and some new situational awareness equipment including new ammunitionhttps://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/drustvo/3979923/modernizovani- tenk-m-84-prezentacija.html. =Exports= About 150 M-84 tanks were exported to Kuwait. The disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s prevented further exports of the M-84. All sales of M84 including negotiations of contracts with foreign partners where done through Yugoimport SDPR. Design =Armament= The M-84A is armed with a 125 mm smoothbore cannon derived from the Soviet 2A46. The fume extractor positioned in the middle of the barrel is shielded with a thermal coating that minimizes deformation of the barrel from high temperatures and ensures it is cooled at the same rate during rapid firing. The M-84 uses an automatic loader, which enables it to sustain a firing rate of 8 rounds per minute. The cannon's ammunition is stowed underneath the turret (40 rounds) within the hull of the tank. This concept was inherited from the original Soviet design for T-72 and is both a strength and weakness of the tank. While the lower hull beneath the turret is one of the least likely place to be hit and penetrated by antitank rounds or mines it also means that in the event of penetration and secondary detonation of the ammunition the crew and tank are unlikely to survive the resulting catastrophic explosion. Along with its primary armament, the M-84 is also armed with one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, and one 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on the commander's turret. All versions of the M-84 have a crew of three. The commander sits on the right side of the turret, the gunner on the left, and the driver sits centrally at the front end of the vehicle. Like most Soviet derived vehicles, the M-84 series of tanks do not have a manual loader, due to the tank's autoloader system. =Protection= The basic tank has a cast steel turret with maximal thickness of 410mm; later, in the M-84A version, a segment made out of a non-metal, most likely rubber and boron carbide (see Chobham armour), was sandwiched between layers of steel. The glacis uses laminate armor, glass in plastic resin between two steel plates, in the A version a 16mm steel plate was welded on the glacis. Total armor protection ranges between 550mm-650mm for the glacis and 560mm-700mm for the turret. During the wars in Yugoslavia the M-84's frontal armor proved very effective against any type of AT threat. Side or rear hits often result in a catastrophic ammo explosion. Twelve smoke grenades are positioned in front of the turret in banks of five and seven grenades. Night vision and gunner's sight are positioned on the top-right side of the turret. The M-84 has a search light used in short-range combat situations. The M-84 tank has nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection capabilities. =Mobility= The base M-84 engine is a 12-cylinder water-cooled V46-6 diesel engine, rated at 574 kW (780 hp). The improved M-84A has a more powerful, V46-TK 735 kW (1,000 hp) engine. With maximum fuel capacity (1,200 litres) the tank's range is 450 km, and with external fuel tanks, this range can be extended to 650 km. The Croatian-made variants have enhanced power plants. The M-84A4 Sniper model has a German-built 820 kW (1,100 hp) engine, while the M-84D has an 895 kW (1,200 hp) engine, the most powerful of all M-84 variants. The M-84D also has greater fuel capacity (1,450 litres). The tank can ford 1.2 meters of water at any time, or up to 5 meters with a snorkel. Variants M-84 (Yugoslavia) ‚Äì The initial version based on the Soviet T-72M and produced between 1984 and 1987. Less than 150 units manufactured. *M-84A (Yugoslavia) ‚Äì An upgraded version similar to the Soviet T-72M1 but with a significantly more powerful engine and additional armour plating. It comes with the new SUV-M-84 computerized fire- control system, including the DNNS-2 gunner's day/night sight, with independent stabilization in two planes and integral laser rangefinder. It also comes with the TNP-160 periscope, TNPA-65 auxiliary periscope, and DNKS-2 day/night commander's periscopes, as well as the TNPO-168V driver's periscope. Produced between 1988 and 1991, closely analogous to the M-84AB. Roughly 450 vehicles manufactured including the M-84AB. *M-84AB (Yugoslavia) ‚Äì Kuwaiti version of the M-84A. Additionally, the M-84AB is fitted with new communication and intercom systems. The Kuwaiti 35th Ash-Shahid (Martyr's) Armoured Brigade, armed with several dozen M-84ABs, took part in Operation Desert Storm. During the fighting, only two M-84AB's were lost, but both were later recovered. Kuwait originally ordered over 200 tanks but received only 150 before the break-up of Yugoslavia and the resulting end of its production. All instruments translated on English/Arabic language. *M-84ABN (Yugoslavia) ‚Äì The M-84AB fitted with land navigation equipment. *M-84AK / ABK Command Tank (Yugoslavia) -M-84AB version fitted with extensive communication equipment, land navigation equipment, and a generator for the command role. *M-84A4 Sniper (Croatia) ‚Äì This version includes the all-new SCS-84 day/night sight, DBR-84 ballistic computer and improved elevation and traverse sensors. Croatia purchased around 40 of these models from 1996 till 2003 from its domestic factory. As rumored, these tanks have a different engine of German origin, rated at 1,100 hp instead of the 1,000 hp powerplant originally installed, but this information has never been officially confirmed. A Racal communication suite also replaced the older communication set. , the entire Croatian M-84 tank fleet was upgraded to the M-84A4 standard. *M-84AI armored recovery vehicle (Yugoslavia and Poland) ‚Äì During the mid-1990s Kuwait requested an armored recovery vehicle variant of the M-84A tank as part of the deal to buy a large batch of M-84A tanks. The vehicle had to be developed in very short time so it was decided that it should be based on an already working foreign vehicle rather than designed and built independently. The Polish WZT-3 license was bought and Polish parts were used in the M-84AI project completed in the \\"14th October\\" Factory in Kru≈°evac. There was also a plan for a M-84ABI for Kuwait, but this idea failed. It is armed only with a 12.7mm machine-gun fitted to the commander's hatch and 12 smoke grenade mortars (8 right and 4 left). Standard equipment includes: A TD-50 crane, front-mounted stabilizing dozer blade, main and secondary winches. *M-84AS (Serbia) ‚Äì Upgrade package of the M-84A in service with the Serbian Army. Adding a new fire control system, new armor consisting of cylindrical pad, high-hardness steel, titanium, aluminum, and NERA as well as modular Kontakt-5 armor, new AT-11 Sniper and Agava-2 thermal sights, and the Shtora defense suite. The first public appearance of the M-84AS was in July 2004 at the Nikinci military base. It appeared to be very similar to the Russian T-90S, both in appearance and in capability. The differences reportedly consist of better armor on the T-90S, whereas the M-84AS has superior maneuverability. The M-84AS was also tested by Kuwaiti Army as part of an international tender. It can also survive multiple hits at relatively close ranges from ATGM's or other hits from tanks. New thermal imaging cameras were mounted for the commander and driver so that the tank can operate at night. It is fitted with the 125 mm 2A46M smooth bore gun and a 1,200 hp diesel engine giving a maximum speed of 72 km/h. In addition, there were a number of undisclosed Arab countries that are interested in the purchase of the M-84AS. *M-84AS1 (Serbia) ‚Äì Latest Serbian variant in prototype stage. Adds additional armor, including explosive reactive armor, integrated day-night sighting system with thermal imager, command information system, a soft-kill active protection system, new radio system,Remote- controlled Weapons Station with 12.7mm machine gun, and CBRN protection equipment. *M-84D (Croatia) ‚Äì This variant brings existing M-84 variants to the M-84D standard, equipped with a new 1,200 hp (895 Kw) engine and new RRAK ERA armor. The M-84D is equipped with a Rafael Defense System ‚Äì Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station, and a new Omega ballistic computer (Slovenian Fotona-made digital ballistic computer). M-84A4 and M-84D have an operational range of 700 km and a maximum speed of 65 km/h.The M-84D has also a 15% faster auto loader,meaning an additional shell being loaded making the rate of 9 shells per minute instead of 8 shells per minute.Holistic Approach to MBT development The M-84D is a second version of the upgraded tanks.It has also chains on the back of the tank to protect the engine and has SLAT armor around the ammunition to prevent an ATG or a shell from hitting it. M-84D received few additional upgrades, Turret basket was added to provide extra space for extra ammunition and to provide increased armor protection. Turret basket has additional slat armor, which adds additional armor to the exterior of the tank. M84D and M84A4 are to receive 12.7mm Kongsberg Protector Remote Weapon Stations which are to be integrated on to all M84D and M84A4 tanks. M-84D will also feature LIRD-4B ‚Äì Laser irradiation detector and warner and LAHAT anti tank missiles. There is a potential for integration of Swiss 120 mm compact gun developed by RUAG. This option is being now seriously considered as this would allow Croatia to use NATO 120 m standard ammunition. 120 mm RUAG compact gun is a preferred option over German Rheinmetall L44 120 mm cannon which is more expensive and would require German support, whereas RUAG will provide technical know how and technology transfer to ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá specijalna vozila d.d.. Only two Croatian tanks have been upgraded to this standard due to budgetary restraints. =Gallery= File:M-84A VS.jpgM-84A File:–ú84 –ê–°1.jpgM-84AS1 File:M-84AB1 - Partner 2019 - 1.jpgM-84AB1 File:M-84AK Vojske Srbije - Odbrana slobode 2019 Ni≈° 3.jpgM-84AK File:Kuwaiti M-84.JPEGKuwait M-84AB File:Croatian M-84 Zagreb Military Parade.JPGM-84A4 File:≈Ωƒë.jpgM84D Operational history =Desert Storm= A Kuwaiti M-84 during Operation Desert Shield Prior to the Persian Gulf War, Kuwait ordered 170 M-84ABs, 15 M-84ABI ARVs and 15 M-84ABK command tanks, from Yugoslavia. Four M-84A tanks were delivered; however, the Iraqi Army soon captured them after the occupation. Further deliveries were stopped for the duration of the war. The Kuwaiti 35th Al-Shaheed Armored Brigade was equipped with 70 M-84s. During the retaking of the country, the 35th Brigade did not directly take part in battles with Iraqi tanks because of the M-84s similarity to Iraqi T-72 or Asad Babils. The M-84 was however very effective against T-62s and T-55s but some unconfirmed reports claim that a few of them were damaged, but recovered and repaired. =Yugoslav wars= Slovenia During the Ten-Day War, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) attempted to regain control over border crossings, airports and other strategic positions in Slovenia. The Slovenian Territorial Defence had no armored units of its own and JNA M-84s were commonly used to break through barricades. Slovenia inherited all the M-84s within its territory, once the ceasefire and Slovenia's independence was accepted. Croatia The M-84 saw action in the Battle of Vukovar, where the JNA and Serbian forces deployed large columns of main battle tanks in urban areas without the adequate support of the infantry. Tanks and APCs found themselves extremely exposed and suffered significant losses mainly to RPGs. It was noted by anti tank crews that the M-84s were extremely durable in comparison to other vehicles fielded by the JNA. One account from a team in the Battle of Vukovar noted that a single M-84 took 5 rounds from various launchers and direction with a 6th only knocking out its engine forcing its crew to bail out (its main gun being destroyed by a \\"lucky\\" AT shot from an RPG-7). Bosnia and Herzegovina During the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, M-84s saw little action, the mainstay of all three warring parties being the T-55. At the beginning of the war, JNA units stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina had passed their equipment to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The VRS had several dozen M-84s, with the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina managing to capture only three M-84s. A number of M-84 tanks were used during the Siege of Sarajevo, as well as during smaller localized conflicts. The number of M-84 tanks destroyed during the Bosnian war is unknown.

It is one of several isomers of octane (C8H18). This particular isomer is the standard 100 point on the octane rating scale (the zero point is n-heptane). It is an important component of gasoline, frequently used in relatively large proportions to increase the knock resistance of the fuel. Strictly speaking, if the standard meaning of ‚Äòiso‚Äô is followed, the name isooctane should be reserved for the isomer 2-methylheptane. However, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is by far the most important isomer of octane and so, historically, it has been assigned this name. Production Isooctane is produced on a massive scale in the petroleum industry by alkylation of isobutene with isobutane. The process is conducted in alkylation units in the presence of acid catalysts. Route to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane from isobutene and isobutane It can also be produced from isobutylene by dimerization using an Amberlyst catalyst to produce a mixture of iso-octenes. Hydrogenation of this mixture produces 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.Dimerization of isobutylene, Amberlyst.com History Engine knocking is an unwanted process that can occur during high compression ratios in internal combustion engines. Graham Edgar in 1926 added different amounts of n-heptane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane to gasoline, and discovered that the knocking stopped when 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was added. This work was the origin of the octane rating scale.Fuels and lubricants handbook, Volume 1, George E. Totten, Steven R. Westbrook, Rajesh J. Shah, page 62 Test motors using 2,2,4-trimethylpentane gave a certain performance that was standardized as 100 octane. The same test motors, run in the same fashion, using heptane, gave a performance which was standardized as 0 octane. All other compounds and blends of compounds then were graded against these two standards and assigned octane numbers.

Reilly in 1931.Reilly WJ (1931) The law of retail gravitation. New York: Knickerbocker Press According to Reilly's \\"law,\\" customers are willing to travel longer distances to larger retail centers given the higher attraction they present to customers. In Reilly's formulation, the attractiveness of the retail center becomes the analogy for size (mass) in the physical law of gravity. The law presumes the geography of the area is flat without any rivers, roads or mountains to alter a consumer's decision of where to travel to buy goods. It also assumes consumers are otherwise indifferent between the actual cities. In analogy with Newton's law of gravitation, the point of indifference is the point at which the \\"attractiveness\\" of the two retail centres (postulated to be proportional to their size and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to them) is equal: : \\\\frac{d_A}{d_B} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{P_A}{P_B}} Where d_A is the distance of the point of indifference from A, d_B is its distance from B, and P_A/P_B is the relative size of the two centres. If the customer is on the line connecting A and B, then if D is the distance between the centres, the point of indifference as measured from A on the line is : d= \\\\frac{D}{1+\\\\sqrt{P_B/P_A}} As expected, for centres of the same size, d=D/2, and if A is larger than B, the point of indifference is closer to B. As the size of A becomes very large with respect to B, d tends to D, meaning the customer will always prefer the larger centre unless they're very close to the smaller one. Antecedents In addition to Newton's Law of Gravity in the physical sciences, there were other antecedents to Reilly's \\"law\\" of retail gravity. In particular, E.C. Young in 1924 described a formula for migration that was based on the physical law of gravity, and H.C. Carey had included a description of the tendency of humans to \\"gravitate\\" together in an 1858 summary of social science theory.Anderson, Patrick L., Business Economics & Finance, CRC Press, 2004; chapter 13. Applications and Later Works Reilly's law has many variations, and extensions and applications are numerous.

It is the oldest Irish organisation dealing with the EU, pre-dating Ireland's membership of the EEC in 1973 by almost twenty years. The organisation is headed by Executive Director, Noelle O'Connell. Maurice Pratt acts as Chairman of the EM Ireland Board. History On 11 January 1954, one hundred people met in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin and founded the Irish Council of the European Movement. Signing the Articles of Association that founded the European Movement were seven pioneers of Ireland's future in Europe. They were: Donal O'Sullivan, University Lecturer; Garret Fitzgerald, Economist; Louis P F Smith, Economist; Denis Corboy, Barrister-at-Law; George J Colley, Solicitor; Declan Costello, Barrister-at-Law; and Sean J Healy, Secretary. These seven signatories laid the first stone paving Ireland's way to full membership of the EU. The aim of the Irish Council was to inform Irish individuals and organisations about the EU. One of its primary objectives was for Ireland to gain membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), as the EU was then known. Former Taoisigh Garret Fitzgerald and Jack Lynch, and former President Mary Robinson backed the initiative and Ireland entered the European Communities in 1972. The Irish Council later became European Movement Ireland. Today the organisation claims to act as source of information for Irish citizens regarding the work of the EU and its stated aim is to promote reasoned robust and fair debate about EU in Ireland. Today European Movement Ireland chiefly promote their aims through sending their speakers to influence public opinion through events such as the Mac Gill summer school in Donegal, using their contacts in the Irish print and radio media to portray the European Union in a favorable light, and by ensuring that the extent of anti European integration feeling in Ireland is hidden by commissioning polls through their affiliates in Red C and other polling companies and promoting the results at home and internationally. It retains an affiliation with the European Youth Parliament, a youth organization which runs events for secondary school age children along the structure of a mock European Parliament. European Movement International European Movement Ireland is part of a pan-European network. European Movement International is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it. It seeks to encourage and facilitate the active participation of citizens and civil society organisations in the European Union as it develops. The European Movement network is represented in over 41 countries and has over 20 international organisations as members. The current President of European Movement is German MEP Jo Leinen.

It is the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa. The camp is operated by U.S. Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia; CJTF- HOA is the most notable tenant command located at the facility as of 2008. A sign bearing the Camp Lemonnier patch. Camp Lemonnier was originally established as garrison for the French Foreign Legion. The base was leased by Djibouti to the United States in 2002, along with the right to use the neighboring airport and port facilities. The base supports Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Horn of Africa (OEF-HOA) and is the centerpiece of a network of around six U.S. drone and surveillance bases stretching across the continent. The latter air bases are smaller and operate from remote hangars situated within local military bases or civilian airports. Due to its strategic location, Camp Lemonnier also serves as a hub for aerial operations in the Persian Gulf region. Djibouti is strategically located by the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Gulf of Aden from the Red Sea and controls the approaches to the Suez Canal. As a result, the country hosts many other foreign military bases, including a Chinese naval base, a French airbase, an Italian Support Base and a Japanese base. Unlike French troops, who are allowed to enter Djibouti city and interact with the locals, US troops may only leave Camp Lemonnier by special permission, and most of Djibouti City is off limits. History Camp Lemonnier is located in the town of Ambouli on the southern side of the Djibouti‚ÄìAmbouli International Airport, between the runway overflow areas and a French military munitions storage facility. After use by the French Foreign Legion, the facility was operated by the Djibouti Armed Forces. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. decided to start counter-terrorism efforts. At first, this was limited to focused attacks, but in 2002 the U.S. government realized that to reduce extremism would require long term engagement with the local governments and populations. As a result, it established the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa to conduct stability operations in the area. In November 2002, the CJTF-HOA staff, a Marine-based organization, arrived off the coast of Djibouti aboard , a naval command ship. CJTF-HOA soldiers taking part in the 2011 Explosive Ordnance Disposal 5-K Run at Camp Lemonnier. A marine FAST team were the initial force to occupy Camp Lemonier in June 2002 and provide security while Army Special Forces Logistics specialists (SOT-A) planned the development to receive more forces. Initial Command and Control was established under SOCCENT by a US Air Force Special Operations command element. The USSOCOM Lessons Learned Document 006-2002, JTF-DJinitial US combat forces started with Air Force MC-130s and MH-53s who redeployed from Jacobabab, Pakistan, followed shortly by 7th SFG soldiers and an Army Tank Support Battalion for base support. While the intent was to move ashore, the Camp Lemonnier facilities which had not been in use for several years were in a state of disrepair. Some buildings were concrete shells and had been stripped of interior fixtures, pipes and wiring, while the roofs of several structures had collapsed. Goats roamed the property and birds had taken roost in several of the abandoned structures. The former swimming pool had been used as a trash dump. Some buildings that were closer to the Djiboutian Air Force controlled side of the airport were in better shape and required minimal renovation. As a result, the CJTF-HOA staff remained aboard the USS Mount Whitney as the U.S. Army (Bravo Company, 46th Engineer Battalion (CBT)(HVY)) began renovations. (Camp Physical Security was first established by Marines from 2D Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST Co) and was handed over to the 551st Military Police Company, 101st Airborne Division) This involved building new concrete pads, maintenance facilities and living areas. In May 2003, Camp Lemonnier was livable and CJTF-HOA transitioned from the Mount Whitney to the camp. The pool was cleaned, refurbished, and opened in spring of 2003. In January 2007, it was announced Camp Lemonnier would be expanded from to nearly . As part of the process of moving Lemonnier from an \\"expeditionary\\" base to a long term facility, the camp built a billeting area with rows of Containerized Living Units (CLUs) with concrete sidewalks and gravel roads.Welcome to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti As the CLU area expanded, the camp population moved from tents into the more durable berthing facilities.Camp Expansion Moves Ahead, United States Central Command Lemonnier originally belonged to the French military, and was named after General √âmile-Ren√© Lemonnier. In 2009, after years of misspelling, the U.S. Navy officially changed the camp's name to properly reflect the spelling of General Lemonnier's name. On 25 January 2012, US officials confirmed that US Navy SEALs had rescued two foreign hostages in Somalia, an American woman and Danish man, taking them to Camp Lemonnier. Demining workers, the captives had been abducted on 25 October 2011 in the north-central Galkayo area, allegedly by gunmen operating on behalf of a private source who threatened to sell them to Al-Shabaab if their demands were not met.Impossible Odds: The Kidnapping of Jessica Buchanan and her Dramatic Rescue by SEAL Team SixSomali elders stand up against kidnapping of aid workers Aid workers kidnapped in Somalia are alive and well As of May 2013, the US had prepared plans for a $1.4 billion expansion of the base and to increase its special forces there to more than 1,000.Containers‚Äîand containing dissent In May 2014, U.S. President Obama and Djiboutian President Guelleh agreed on a 20-year extension of the American lease, at $63 million a year in rent ‚Äì about double its previous rate. The US is in the process of expanding the base and plans to spend $1.4 billion upgrading the facility over the next two decades. In 2017, China opened a base nearby. From that military base laser beams originated, injuring the eyes of American Air Force pilots. China denied that they were the source of the lasers. Base of operations \\"Thunder Dome\\" at Camp Lemonnier Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) began moving all headquarters personnel and equipment from its flagship, USS Mount Whitney, in the Gulf of Aden, into facilities at Camp Lemonnier on 6 May 2003. Djiboutian workers were instrumental in preparing the newly renovated camp for movement of the CJTF headquarters ashore. More than 1,200 local and third-country national construction and support personnel currently work at the camp. KBR administers the contract for facilities and support operations for the camp. On 1 July 2006, the U.S. Marine Corps turned over responsibility for Camp Lemonnier to the U.S. Navy in a brief change of command ceremony. U.S. Navy Captain Robert Fahey assumed command of Camp Lemonnier from U.S. Marine Corps Colonel Gerard Fischer. In early July 2006, the U.S. and Djiboutian governments also announced that a lease agreement had been signed to expand Camp Lemonnier from to nearly 500 acres (2 km¬≤). The term of the lease was for five years, with options to renew. As part of the lease and expansion, physical improvements to the camp included fencing, additional billeting to replace existing tents, and compliance with various U.S. force protection standoff requirements. By 2009, the base began expansion again. According to OSGEOINT, the base received a parallel taxi-way and a new auxiliary support apron. In the following year (2011), open source satellite imagery showed Camp Lemmonier with a new drone apron supporting the RQ/MQ-1 Predator. # REGISTRATION NEEDED # Furthermore, Camp Lemmonier has been described by The Economist as \\"the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan\\", with drones conducting missions in adjacent Yemen and Somalia. Camp Lemonnier became the hub for black and white SOF operations into nations such as Somalia and Yemen. Also based there is the SOCCE-HOA (Special Operations Command and Control Element-Horn of Africa) ‚Äì which commands all SOCOM units assigned to training or operational missions in the region including elements of JSOTF-TS (Joint Special Operations Task Force-Trans Sahara) and Naval Special Warfare Unit 10. It also coordinates a rotational detachment of US Army Special Forces which conducts foreign Internal Defence training in counterinsurgency in both Djibouti and in countries such as Mali. In a separate secure compound within the base there are an estimated 300 JSOC personnel: special operators, intelligence and imagery analysts and a dedicated UAV cell. The UAV cell is commanded by a JSOC Major and tasks a flight of 8 MQ-1 Predators conducting operations over Somalia, Mali and Yemen, the Predators have been carrying out strikes and surveillance missions from Camp Lemonnier since late 2010. Prior to that, both CIA and JSOC had used the base as a temporary forward location for Predator and Reaper sorties into the region.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp. 280‚Äì82 In October 2011, a squadron of USAF F-15E was deployed to the base and have flown numerous combat missions into Yemen in support of both Yemeni government forces and unilateral strikes directed by JSOC and the CIA targeting cells. Along with the UAV's and F-15E's, surveillance flights are conducted by Air Force Special Operations Command U-28As, that are outfitted with sophisticated signals intercept equipment and optical sensors, which can provide real-time intelligence for ground operators.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 282 In 2013, the UAV's operating out of the base were moved to Chabelley Airport ‚Äì which increased operational security and allayed local fears after a UAV and its Hellfire missile crashed in a Djibouti suburb. Transfer to USAFRICOM On 1 October 2008, responsibility for the task force was transferred from the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) to United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM) as the latter assumed authority over the African theater of operations.

Purpose  Thomas Edison State College established the institute in response to the expressed needs of decision- makers across New Jersey to have a resource for researching public policy. The approach of the institute is to apply the resources of higher education to public policy decisions in a practical and hands-on manner. The institute provides practical research, technical assistance, and other expertise. It supports the capacity of decision-makers to address the most critical issues facing New Jersey. The institute's work is driven by the needs of the decision-makers themselves, not by the internal academic or political agenda of the college. The Watson Institute places emphasis on developing long-term partnerships rather than short-term consulting relationships. The institute's goal is to support and strengthen partners' ability to address critical issues as they arise, rather than focusing narrowly on a particular crisis or \\"hot issue\\" and departing. Abstract, theoretical issues, and policy aftermaths are avoided, with the focus being on forward-looking solutions to practical issues.John S.

She was named after Gerardus Mercator (1512‚Äì1594), a Belgian cartographer. She was designed by G.L. Watson & Co. and built in Leith, Scotland and launched in 1932. Besides being a training a ship, she was also used, mainly before World War II, for scientific observations, or as ambassador for Belgium on world fairs and in sailing events. In 1961, she became a floating museum, first in Antwerp and, from 1964, in the marina of Ostend, just in front of the city hall. As of 2019, she remains open to visitors. {Mercator at sea, painting by Yasmina (Ostend, Belgium) Mercator in the North Sea, painting by Freddy Van Daele (Hosdent-Latinne, Belgium) } Specifications Mercator is a composite rigging. The foremast carries square sails, the main mast and the mizzen mast are rigged with fore and aft- sails. Usually the Mercator carried 15 sails with a total surface of about 1600 m¬≤. By fair wind she could easily make 13 knots. History Mercator at Ostend in 2012 Mercator's real career started off in 1934 when the ship sailed from Pitcairn Island, Tahiti, Papeete, to the Marquis Islands and Honolulu for a Belgo-French scientific expedition. This was her seventh cruise and known to be a fairly remarkable one to those preceding World War Two. At the end of this expedition, two of the famous Easter Island statues were donated by the Chilean government, one to France and one to Belgium. Both statues were transported back to Europe on board the Mercator. In 1936 Ostend's Mercator had the great honor of bringing home the remains of the Flemish missionary and apostle of the lepers, Pater Damiaan, from Molokai island. On February 21, 1940, Mercator set out for her last cruise before World War 2. She sailed to Rio de Janeiro and afterward arrived in Boma. From early 1945 to mid 1947, the ship was under the custody of the British Admiralty as a \\"Submarine Depot Ship\\". Unfortunately after 1947 the once elegant ship would not be able to put to sea again until January 20, 1951. After her horrible experience in Great Britain, the ship went back to Belgium to receive extensive maintenance work. In 1951, Mercator returned to service as a training ship and completed 41 voyages, sailing almost all seas. After that she performed quite a few scientific missions. Besides that, she even competed in Tall Ships Races from Torbay-Lisbon (1956), Brest-Canary Islands (1958) and winning line honours in the Oslo-Ostend (1960) race. All these historic events of the ship would have been impossible without the captains: Captain R. Van de Sande (from 1932 till 1955), Captain R. Ghys (from 1955 till 1960). In 1964, Mercator became a floating museum in Ostend, moored in front of the City Hall, and since 1996 has been given National Heritage status. On 30 September 2016, Mercator was removed from her usual mooring and dry-docked for an extensive overhaul elsewhere in Ostend harbour.

He was the son of Thomas Fairfax, 5th Lord Fairfax of Cameron and of Catherine, daughter of Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper. The only resident peer in late colonial America, Fairfax administered his vast Northern Neck Proprietary ‚Äî a Virginia land grant dating back to 1649 ‚Äî from his wilderness estate at Greenway Court, Virginia. He bought and sold people and derived much of his income from the forced labor of several hundred enslaved people on some 30 farms. Various place names in Northern Virginia and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia are named for himmost notably Fairfax County, Virginia and the independent City of Fairfax, Virginia. Early life Born in Kent, England at Leeds Castle ‚Äî owned by his maternal Culpeper ancestors since the 1630s ‚Äî Lord Fairfax succeeded to his title in 1709. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford University between 1710 and 1713 and afterward held a commission in the Royal Horse Guards (1721‚Äì1733). He was a contributor to the early newspaper The Spectator. Coat of arms of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, which was adapted into the official Seal of the County of Fairfax, Virginia.center In 1719, Fairfax came into possession of the vast Culpeper family estates in Virginia's Northern Neck Proprietary between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers. These lands included a great portion of the Shenandoah and South Branch Potomac valleys, in all consisting of some 5,282,000 acres (21,380 km¬≤). Struggling to keep up an expensive lifestyle and maintain Leeds Castle, Fairfax relied on the income from his Virginia tract, both from the sale of land and the annual quit rents, paid by planters who settled in the Northern Neck. These rents were collected by his resident land agent, Robert \\"King\\" Carter (1662‚Äì1732). In the fall of 1732, Fairfax read Carter's obituary in the London monthly The Gentleman's Magazine and was astonished to read of the vast personal wealth Carter had accumulated, which included ¬£10,000 in cash: this at a time when the Governor of Virginia was paid an annual salary of ¬£200. Rather than appoint another Virginian to the position, Lord Fairfax arranged to have his cousin Colonel William Fairfax move in 1734 from Massachusetts to Virginia to serve as his resident land agent. In North America Christ Episcopal Church in Winchester, Virginia Lord Fairfax travelled to Virginia for the first time between 1735 and 1737 to inspect and protect his lands. In 1738, about thirty farms were established as part of his Patterson Creek Manor near present-day Burlington, Mineral County, West Virginia. The northwestern boundary of his Northern Neck Proprietary, which had been contested by the English Privy Council, was marked in 1746 by the \\"Fairfax Stone\\" at the headwaters of the North Branch Potomac River. Returning to America in 1747, he first settled at Belvoir (present-day Fort Belvoir), an estate which had been completed by Col. Fairfax six years earlier. That year he also set aside land for his personal use at Swan Pond Manor (located near present-day Martinsburg, Berkeley County, West Virginia). He then became active in developing his lands and collecting ground rents. Fairfax was the only resident peer in the Thirteen Colonies.Historians do not support the claim of William Alexander that he was entitled to be the Earl of Stirling. In 1748, he made the acquaintance of George Washington, then a youth of 16, a distant relative of the Yorkshire Fairfax family. Impressed with Washington's energy and talents, Lord Fairfax employed him (Washington's first employment) to survey his lands lying west of the Blue Ridge.George Washington's elder half brother Lawrence Washington (1718-1752) was married to Anne (1728-1761) a daughter of Col. William Fairfax of Belvoir ‚Äî a land agent and cousin of Lord Thomas Fairfax. Anne's brother, George William Fairfax, was married to Sally Fairfax (nee Cary). Fairfax, a lifelong bachelor, moved out to the Shenandoah Valley in 1752. At the suggestion of his nephew Thomas Bryan Martin, he fixed his residence at a hunting lodge at Greenway Court, near White Post, Clarke County. Here he and Martin lived together in a style of liberal hospitality, frequently indulging in the diversion of the chase. He served as county lieutenant and as justice of the peace for Frederick County which then included Clarke. Though an avowed Loyalist, Fairfax kept quiet and was known to be close to Washington. He was never insulted or molested. Title to his domain, however, was confiscated during the hostilities by the Virginia Act of 1779. Less than two months after the 1781 defeat of the British army at Yorktown, the 88-year-old Fairfax died at his seat at Greenway Court. He was buried on the east side of Christ Church (Episcopal) in Winchester, Virginia. Legacy *Lord Fairfax's title descended to his only surviving brother, Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, who died at Leeds Castle in 1793. Since, but for the war, his immense domain should also have passed to Robert Fairfax, the latter was awarded ¬£13,758 in 1792, by Act of Parliament for the relief of American Loyalists. A portion of this estate, devised to nephew Denny Martin Fairfax, was later the subject of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Martin v.

In 1998 revenue minister Rane, in his position as a quasi-judicial authority, had decided in favour of Datta Bahirat who had given his power of attorney to Rohan Builders. Bahirat through Rohan Builders had sought to return his land that had been acquired by the government for housing flood-affected persons following the rupture of the Panshet Dam at Pune in 1961. Citing a 1994 High Court order, Rane gave back the unused 2.15 lakh sq feet of the 2.75 lakh sq feet to Bahirat on the repayment of '16 lakh to the government exchequer.http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/article523915.ece In Jan 2011, a delegation of Shiv Sena leaders met Maharashtra Governor K.

They are found in plants and animals. Cryptochromes are involved in the circadian rhythms of plants and animals, and possibly also in the sensing of magnetic fields in a number of species. The name cryptochrome was proposed as a portmanteau combining the cryptic nature of the photoreceptor, and the cryptogamic organisms on which many blue-light studies were carried out. The two genes Cry1 and Cry2 code for the two cryptochrome proteins CRY1 and CRY2. In insects and plants, CRY1 regulates the circadian clock in a light-dependent fashion, whereas, in mammals, CRY1 and CRY2 act as light-independent inhibitors of CLOCK-BMAL1 components of the circadian clock. In plants, blue-light photoreception can be used to cue developmental signals. Besides chlorophylls, cryptochromes are the only proteins known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in vivo.  Discovery  Although Charles Darwin first documented plant responses to blue light in the 1880s, it was not until the 1980s that research began to identify the pigment responsible. In 1980, researchers discovered that the HY4 gene of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana was necessary for the plant's blue light sensitivity, and, when the gene was sequenced in 1993, it showed high sequence homology with photolyase, a DNA repair protein activated by blue light. By 1995, it became clear that the products of the HY4 gene and its two human homologs did not exhibit photolyase activity and were instead a new class of blue light photoreceptor hypothesized to be circadian photopigments. In 1996 and 1998, Cry homologs were identified in Drosophila and mice, respectively.  Evolutionary history and structure  Cryptochromes (CRY1, CRY2) are evolutionarily old and highly conserved proteins that belong to the flavoproteins superfamily that exists in all kingdoms of life. All members of this superfamily have the characteristics of an N-terminal photolyase homology (PHR) domain. The PHR domain can bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and a light-harvesting chromophore. Cryptochromes are derived from and closely related to photolyases, which are bacterial enzymes that are activated by light and involved in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. In eukaryotes, cryptochromes no longer retain this original enzymatic activity. The structure of cryptochrome involves a fold very similar to that of photolyase, with a single molecule of FAD noncovalently bound to the protein. These proteins have variable lengths and surfaces on the C-terminal end, due to the changes in genome and appearance that result from the lack of DNA repair enzymes. The Ramachandran plot shows that the secondary structure of the CRY1 protein is primarily a right-handed alpha helix with little to no steric overlap. The structure of CRY1 is almost entirely made up of alpha helices, with several loops and few beta sheets. The molecule is arranged as an orthogonal bundle.  Function  = Phototropism = In plants, cryptochromes mediate phototropism, or directional growth toward a light source, in response to blue light. This response is now known to have its own set of photoreceptors, the phototropins. Unlike phytochromes and phototropins, cryptochromes are not kinases. Their flavin chromophore is reduced by light and transported into the cell nucleus, where it affects the turgor pressure and causes subsequent stem elongation. To be specific, Cry2 is responsible for blue-light-mediated cotyledon and leaf expansion. Cry2 overexpression in transgenic plants increases blue-light-stimulated cotyledon expansion, which results in many broad leaves and no flowers rather than a few primary leaves with a flower. A double loss-of-function mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana Early Flowering 3 (elf3) and Cry2 genes delays flowering under continuous light and was shown to accelerate it during long and short days, which suggests that Arabidopsis CRY2 may play a role in accelerating flowering time during continuous light. = Photomorphogenesis = Cryptochromes receptors cause plants to respond to blue light via photomorphogenesis. Cryptochromes help control seed and seedling development, as well as the switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage of development. In Arabidopsis, it is shown that cryptochromes controls plant growth during sub-optimal blue-light conditions. = Light capture = Despite much research on the topic, cryptochrome photoreception and phototransduction in Drosophila and Arabidopsis thaliana is still poorly understood. Cryptochromes are known to possess two chromophores: pterin (in the form of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolic acid (MTHF)) and flavin (in the form of FAD). Both may absorb a photon, and in Arabidopsis, pterin appears to absorb at a wavelength of 380 nm and flavin at 450 nm. Past studies have supported a model by which energy captured by pterin is transferred to flavin. Under this model of phototransduction, FAD would then be reduced to FADH, which probably mediates the phosphorylation of a certain domain in cryptochrome. This could then trigger a signal transduction chain, possibly affecting gene regulation in the cell nucleus. A new hypothesis proposes that in plant cryptochromes, the transduction of the light signal into a chemical signal that might be sensed by partner molecules could be triggered by a photo-induced negative charge within the protein - on the FAD cofactor or on the neighbouring aspartic acid. This negative charge would electrostatically repel the protein-bound ATP molecule and thereby also the protein C-terminal domain, which covers the ATP binding pocket prior to photon absorption. The resulting change in protein conformation could lead to phosphorylation of previously inaccessible phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus and the given phosphorylated segment could then liberate the transcription factor HY5 by competing for the same binding site at the negative regulator of photomorphogenesis COP1. A different mechanism may function in Drosophila. The true ground state of the flavin cofactor in Drosophila CRY is still debated, with some models indicating that the FAD is in an oxidized form, while others support a model in which the flavin cofactor exists in anion radical form, ‚Ä¢. Recently, researchers have observed that oxidized FAD is readily reduced to ‚Ä¢ by light. Furthermore, mutations that blocked photoreduction had no effect on light-induced degradation of CRY, while mutations that altered the stability of ‚Ä¢ destroyed CRY photoreceptor function. These observations provide support for a ground state of ‚Ä¢. Researchers have also recently proposed a model in which is excited to its doublet or quartet state by absorption of a photon, which then leads to a conformational change in the CRY protein. In sponge eyes, blue-light-receptive cryptochrome is also expressed. Most animal eyes utilize photo-sensitive opsin proteins expressed in neurons to communicate information of the light environment to the nervous system, whereas sponge larvae use pigment ring eyes to mediate phototactic swimming. However, despite possessing many other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the fully sequenced genome of Amphimedon queenslandica, a demosponge larva, apparently lacks a gene for a light- sensitive opsin pigment, suggesting that the sponge's unique eyes might have evolved a novel light-detection mechanism. Research using RNA probes indicated that one of the two cryptochromes, Aq-Cry2, was produced near the sponge's simple eye cells. Aq-Cry2 lacks photolyase activity and contains a flavin- based co-factor that is responsive to wavelengths of light that also mediate larval photic behavior. Defined as an opsin-clade GPCR, it possesses a conserved Shiff base lysine that is central to opsin function. Like other sponges, A. queenslandica lacks a nervous system. This indicates that opsin- less sponge eyes utilize cryptochrome, along with other proteins, to direct or act in eye-mediated phototactic behavior. = Circadian rhythm = Studies in animals and plants suggest that cryptochromes play a pivotal role in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms. Similarly, cryptochromes play an important role in the entrainment of circadian rhythms in plants. In Drosophila, cryptochrome (dCRY) acts as a blue-light photoreceptor that directly modulates light input into the circadian clock, while in mammals, cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) act as transcription repressors within the circadian clockwork. Some insects, including the monarch butterfly, have both a mammal-like and a Drosophila-like version of cryptochrome, providing evidence for an ancestral clock mechanism involving both light-sensing and transcriptional-repression roles for cryptochrome. Cry mutants have altered circadian rhythms, showing that Cry affects the circadian pacemaker. Drosophila with mutated Cry exhibit little to no mRNA cycling. A point mutation in cryb, which is required for flavin association in CRY protein, results in no PER or TIM protein cycling in either DD or LD. In addition, mice lacking Cry1 or Cry2 genes exhibit differentially altered free running periods, but are still capable of photoentrainment. However, mice that lack both Cry1 and Cry2 are arrhythmic in both LD and DD and always have high Per1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that cryptochromes play a photoreceptive role, as well as acting as negative regulators of Per gene expression in mice.  In Drosophila  In Drosophila, cryptochrome functions as a blue light photoreceptor. Exposure to blue light induces a conformation similar to that of the always-active CRY mutant with a C-terminal deletion (CRYŒî). The half- life of this conformation is 15 minutes in the dark and facilitates the binding of CRY to other clock gene products, PER and TIM, in a light-dependent manner. Once bound by dCRY, dTIM is committed to degradation by the ubiquitin- proteasome system. Although light pulses do not entrain, full photoperiod LD cycles can still drive cycling in the ventral-lateral neurons in the Drosophila brain. These data along with other results suggest that CRY is the cell-autonomous photoreceptor for body clocks in Drosophila and may play a role in nonparametric entrainment (entrainment by short discrete light pulses). However, the lateral neurons receive light information through both the blue light CRY pathway and the rhodopsin pathway. Therefore, CRY is involved in light perception and is an input to the circadian clock, however it is not the only input for light information, as a sustained rhythm has been shown in the absence of the CRY pathway, in which it is believed that the rhodopsin pathway is providing some light input. Recently, it has also been shown that there is a CRY-mediated light response that is independent of the classical circadian CRY-TIM interaction. This mechanism is believed to require a flavin redox-based mechanism that is dependent on potassium channel conductance. This CRY-mediated light response has been shown to increase action potential firing within seconds of a light response in opsin-knockout Drosophila. Cryptochrome, like many genes involved in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein levels. In Drosophila, Cry mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), with high levels in light and low levels in the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the Cry gene also cycles with a similar trend. CRY protein levels, however, cycle in a different manner than Cry transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, CRY protein has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock at the transcriptional level and by light at the translational and posttranslational level. Overexpression of Cry also affects circadian light responses. In Drosophila, Cry overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light. This light regulation of CRY protein levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.  In mammals  Cryptochrome is one of the four groups of mammalian clock genes/proteins that generate a transcription-translation negative-feedback loop (TTFL), along with Period (PER), CLOCK, and BMAL1. In this loop, CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins are transcriptional activators, which together bind to the promoters of the Cry and Per genes and activate their transcription. The CRY and PER proteins then bind to each other, enter the nucleus, and inhibit CLOCK-BMAL1-activated transcription. In mice, Cry1 expression displays circadian rhythms in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a brain region involved in the generation of circadian rhythms, with mRNA levels peaking during the light phase and reaching a minimum in the dark. These daily oscillations in expression are maintained in constant darkness. While CRY has been well established as a TIM homolog in mammals, the role of CRY as a photoreceptor in mammals has been controversial. Early papers indicated that CRY has both light-independent and -dependent functions. A study in 2000 indicated that mice without rhodopsin but with cryptochrome still respond to light; however, in mice without either rhodopsin or cryptochrome, c-Fos transcription, a mediator of light sensitivity, significantly drops. In recent years, data have supported melanopsin as the main circadian photoreceptor, in particular melanopsin cells that mediate entrainment and communication between the eye and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). One of the main difficulties in confirming or denying CRY as a mammalian photoreceptor is that when the gene is knocked out the animal goes arrhythmic, so it is hard to measure its capacity as purely a photoreceptor. However, some recent studies indicate that human CRY may mediate light response in peripheral tissues. Normal mammalian circadian rhythm relies critically on delayed expression of Cry1 following activation of the Cry1 promoter. Whereas rhythms in Per2 promoter activation and Per2 mRNA levels have almost the same phase, Cry1 mRNA production is delayed by approximately four hours relative to Cry1 promoter activation. This delay is independent of CRY1 or CRY2 levels and is mediated by a combination of E/E'-box and D-box elements in the promoter and RevErbA/ROR binding elements (RREs) in the gene's first intron. Transfection of arrhythmic Cry1‚àí/‚àí Cry2‚àí/‚àí double-knockout cells with only the Cry1 promoter (causing constitutive Cry1 expression) is not sufficient to rescue rhythmicity. Transfection of these cells with both the promoter and the first intron is required for restoration of circadian rhythms in these cells. = Magnetoreception = Experimental data suggests that cryptochromes in the photoreceptor neurons of birds' eyes are involved in magnetic orientation during migration. Cryptochromes are also thought to be essential for the light-dependent ability of Drosophila to sense magnetic fields. Magnetic fields were once reported to affect cryptochromes also in Arabidopsis thaliana plants: growth behavior seemed to be affected by magnetic fields in the presence of blue (but not red) light. Nevertheless, these results have later turned out to be irreproducible under strictly controlled conditions in another laboratory, suggesting that plant cryptochromes do not respond to magnetic fields. Cryptochrome forms a pair of radicals with correlated spins when exposed to blue light. Radical pairs can also be generated by the light- independent dark reoxidation of the flavin cofactor by molecular oxygen through the formation of a spin-correlated FADH-superoxide radical pairs. Magnetoreception is hypothesized to function through the surrounding magnetic field's effect on the correlation (parallel or anti-parallel) of these radicals, which affects the lifetime of the activated form of cryptochrome. Activation of cryptochrome may affect the light-sensitivity of retinal neurons, with the overall result that the animal can sense the magnetic field. Animal cryptochromes and closely related animal (6-4) photolyases contain a longer chain of electron-transferring tryptophans than other proteins of the cryptochrome-photolyase superfamily (a tryptophan tetrad instead of a triad). The longer chain leads to a better separation and over 1000√ó longer lifetimes of the photoinduced flavin-tryptophan radical pairs than in proteins with a triad of tryptophans. The absence of spin-selective recombination of these radical pairs on the nanosecond to microsecond timescales seems to be incompatible with the suggestion that magnetoreception by cryptochromes is based on the forward light reaction.

The cave is approximately 490 feet (150 m) long. The cave is privately owned, and tours are given during the summer months and in October. This cave has been associated with the Bell Witch, a period during which the Bell Family was allegedly haunted by the Bell Witch. The cave is located on property once owned by the Bell family. Many believe that when the witch departed, she fled to the sanctuary of this cave. In the particular legend in which the cave is featured, young Betsy Bell and some of her friends had gone to explore the cave. While they were there, one of the boys crawled into a hole and became stuck. A voice cried out, \\"I'll get him out!\\". The boy felt hands grasping his feet, and he was pulled out of the hole.

It lies between the mesopelagic above, and the abyssopelagic below. The average temperature hovers at about . Although larger by volume than the photic zone, the bathyal zone is less densely populated. Sunlight does not reach this zone, meaning primary production, if any, is almost nonexistent. There are no known plants because of the lack of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. It is known as the midnight (also twilight or dark) zone because of this feature. Fauna Because of the lack of light, some species do not have eyes. Those possessing eyes in this zone include the viperfish and the frill shark. Many forms of nekton live in the bathyal zone, such as squid, large whales, and octopuses. In the bathyal, some of the world's largest whales feed. Sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids are also common in the bathyal zone. Animals in the bathyal zone are not threatened by predators that can see them, so they do not have powerful muscles. This zone is difficult for fish to live in since it is especially hard to find nutrients. They have become very energy efficient, and many have slow metabolic rates to conserve energy. The fish are characterized by weak muscles, soft skin, and slimy bodies. The adaptations of some of the fish that live there include small eyes and transparent skin. Except where the ocean is exceptionally deep, the bathyal zone extends to the benthic zone on the ocean bed of that part of the continental slope that lies between 1000 and 4000 meters deep. The bathyal zone contains sharks, squid, octopuses, and many different species of fish. This includes deep-water anglerfish, gulper eel, amphipods and dragonfish. Hydrothermal Exploration The bathyal zone is of interest to those studying biogeochemistry or deep sea mining. As of 2013, the majority of visually-confirmed hydrothermal vents are located at depths of to .

It considers itself the oldest environmental and non-governmental organisation in Ireland. Naturalist Robert Lloyd Praeger was its first President. An Taisce is a membership organisation and charity, not a state or semi-state organisation. However, it receives government funding for specific programmes, such as Blue Flag beaches,Blue Flag beaches Green SchoolsGreen Schools and the annual National Spring Clean,National Spring Clean and it has a statutory role in certain planning and environmental processes in the country. Role An Taisce's range of expertise extends across Ireland's natural, built, and social heritage. It seeks to educate, inform, and lead public opinion on the environment, to advocate and influence policy, and to manage a small portfolio of heritage properties. =Statutory roles= The Planning Acts provide for An Taisce, and about 20 other prescribed bodies, to be informed of all planning applications in areas of scenic beauty or high amenity significance or where architectural, archaeological or environmental issues need to be considered. Local authorities are required, in certain defined circumstances under the Planning & Development Regulations, to consult An Taisce on development proposals. Operations The organisation is split into three operational divisions: * The Environmental Education Unit operates nationwide programmes on behalf of the Irish government's Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the National Transport Authority and the European Union, such as the Blue Flag water quality accreditation programme and Green Schools Programme that aims to promote higher environmental standards in schools. * The Environmental Advocacy Unit monitors roughly 5% of all planning (local authority development approval) applications made annually, making submissions on a small number of those received, and appealing about 300 decisions a year to An Bord Plean√°la, the statutory planning appeals board. The Advocacy Unit also monitors environmental standards and co-ordinates policy formation from the elected advocacy committees amongst the membership. * The Properties Unit takes ownership of and looks after properties that have either historical significance or are environmentally sensitive. The properties listed below are taken care of by both professional staff and volunteers who are involved with the day-to-day management of income generating properties such as Tailors Hall (which it also makes available for private hire) and the restoration of important resources such as the Boyne Navigation. Structure The organisation comprises over 5,000 members, with a range of membership fees. Some members are also organised in local organisations. Overall steering of the organisation is in the hands of a Council, which in turn elects a Board of Management, and other internal policy and operational committees.

It has 25,000 members working in film, television, radio and all other recorded media. The organization negotiates, safeguards, and promotes the professional rights of its members. It also works to increase work opportunities for its members and lobbies for policy changes at the municipal, provincial and federal levels. ACTRA's regional chapters present ACTRA Awards to honour the best in Canadian radio and television performances in their local productions. Affiliations ACTRA is affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress and the International Federation of Actors. In July, 2005, ACTRA and the United Steelworkers announced that the two unions have entered into a strategic alliance to take on the globalization of the culture industry and to address a range of common issues.  What the acronym means  The earliest form of the organization represented radio performers in Toronto in the 1940s. This organization was called RATS: the Radio Artists of Toronto Society. In 1943, with wider involvement of groups from other Canadian cities, the Association of Canadian Radio Artists (ACRA) was formed. ACRA over time evolved into the Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists, the Canadian Council of Authors and Artists, the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists and, in 1984, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists. Regional issues led to the creation of the Union of British Columbia Performers, a separate subunit of ACTRA for British Columbia only. ACTRA awards Every year, ACTRA branches across the country present the ACTRA Awards, some of which are handed out for performances, while others are given for union-activism and contributions to the industry.

Theories X, Y and various versions of Z have been used in human resource management, organizational behavior, organizational communication and organizational development. McGregor's Theory X states that workers inherently dislike and avoid work and must be driven to it, in contrast to Theory Y which states that work is natural and can be a source of satisfaction when aimed at higher order human psychological needs. One Theory Z was developed by Abraham H. Maslow in his paper \\"Theory Z\\",Theory Z ‚Äì Abraham Maslow which was published in 1969 in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology.Conway, T., (2008), Abraham Maslow, Transpersonal Psychology, and self-Transcendence, accessed 28 June 2020http://www.positivedisintegration.com/masid.htmhttp://www.intropsych.com/ch09_motivation/theory_z.html A second theory is the 3D theory which was developed by W. J. Reddin in his book Managerial Effectiveness (1970), and a third theory is William Ouchi's so-called \\"Japanese management\\" style, which was explained in his book Theory Z: How American Business Can Meet the Japanese Challenge (1981) responding to the Asian economic boom of the 1980s. For Ouchi, Theory Z focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life with a strong focus on the well-being of the employee, both on and off the job. According to Ouchi, Theory Z management tends to promote stable employment, high productivity, and high employee morale and satisfaction. Pre-Theory Z Abraham Maslow, a psychologist and pioneer in human motivation, developed a theory of motivation based upon human needs that had three assumptions. First, human needs are never completely satisfied. Second, human behavior is purposeful and motivated by a need for satisfaction. Third, these needs can be classified according to a hierarchical structure of importance from the lowest to highest (Maslow, 1954): # Physiological need # Safety needs # Belongingness and love needs # The esteem needs ‚Äì self-confidence # The need for self- actualization ‚Äì the need to reach your full potential Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory helps the manager to understand what motivates an employee. By understanding what needs must be met in order for an employee to achieve the highest level of motivation, managers are then able to get the most out of production. Theory X and Theory Y were both developed by Douglas McGregor, a social psychologist interested in the characteristics of successful organizations. McGregor's book, The Human Side of Enterprise (1960), described Theory X and Theory Y based upon Maslow's original hierarchy of needs. McGregor grouped the hierarchy into a lower order (Theory X) needs and a higher-order (Theory Y) needs. He suggested that management could use either set of needs to motivate employees, but better results could be gained by the use of Theory Y, rather than Theory X (Heil, Bennis, & Stephens, 2000).  Maslow's Theory Z  Late in his career Maslow focused increasingly on self- transcendence as a human phenomenon and concern. As he explained in his seminal paper titled Theory Z, the motivation for transcendence literally 'transcends' his original hierarchy of needs. So, for example, some people who achieve self-actualization ‚Äî the highest level of his original pyramid ‚Äî also achieve a transcendent life orientation, while other self-actualizers do not. On the other hand, some people, like the proverbial \\"starving artist,\\" value self-transcendence ahead of all material values, including self-actualization (in the sense of being materially \\"successful\\"). Hence, transcendence for Maslow is not so much an extension of his original pyramid as an orthogonal dimension. Theory X, Y and Z all play a role in how a company should manage successfully. Maslow believed the ideal organization would harness the human drive for self-transcendence, as well as the motivations of his original pyramid. References Further reading * Bacarr, Jina.

Phototropins can be found throughout the leaves of a plant. Along with cryptochromes and phytochromes they allow plants to respond and alter their growth in response to the light environment. Phototropins may also be important for the opening of stomata and the movement of chloroplasts. These blue light receptors are seen across the entire green plant lineage. When Phototropins are hit with blue light, they induce a signal transduction pathway that alters the plant cells' functions in different ways. Phototropins are part of the phototropic sensory system in plants that causes various environmental responses in plants. Phototropins specifically will cause stems to bend towards light and stomata to open. Phototropins have been shown to impact the movement of chloroplast inside the cell. In addition phototropins mediate the first changes in stem elongation in blue light prior to cryptochrome activation. Phototropin is also required for blue light mediated transcript destabilization of specific mRNAs in the cell. They are present in the guard cell.

The aircraft operating the service was a Douglas DC-6A four-engined propeller airliner, registration first placed into service in 1955. Accident sequence While originally scheduled to depart at 2:45pm, delays due to snowfall pushed departure back to 6:01pm. At takeoff, with a nearly full complement of 95 passengers and 6 crewmembers (3 flight crew and 3 stewardesses), the plane weighed in at , just below maximum takeoff weight. Despite some sliding of the nosewheel on snow-covered pavement, the airplane was cleared to take off via runway 04 (040¬∞ magnetic heading), departing to the northeast of the field. After what was described as a normal takeoff roll, the aircraft lifted off. Upon establishing a positive rate of climb, the landing gear and wing flaps were retracted, and the engine power was reduced to the maximum except for takeoff (METO) setting. The aircraft was now gaining altitude, flying on instruments without outside visibility as it headed over Flushing Bay. While the aircraft's clearance instructed that it proceed northeast on a heading of 40¬∞ (runway heading), the airplane began a gradual turn to the left. When it had reached a heading of 285¬∞ (nearly due west), it overflew Rikers Island. Its altitude was insufficient to clear the trees on the island, and the aircraft crashed, coming to rest within 1,500 feet of the point of first impact. The duration of the flight from takeoff to crash was approximately 60 seconds. The crash resulted in 20 fatalities and 78 injuries among the passengers and several injuries but no fatalities among the crew. Recovery Shortly after the crash, Rikers Island department personnel and prison trustees (inmates whose good behavior had earned the guards‚Äô trust) alike ran to the crash in order to help survivors. As a result of their actions, of the 57 inmates who assisted with the rescue effort, 30 were released and 16 received a reduction of six months by the N.Y.C. Parole Board. Governor W. Averell Harriman also granted commutation of sentence to 11 men serving definite sentences: two received a six months reduction; one workhouse and eight penitentiary definites became eligible for immediate release. Investigation An investigation by the Civil Aeronautics Board was hampered by a lack of information about what transpired aboard the aircraft in its final minute, as flight data and cockpit voice recorders had not yet been routinely installed in commercial aircraft. The Board found that the probable cause of the accident was \\"The failure of the captain to: 1) properly observe and interpret his flight instruments, and 2) maintain control of his aircraft.\\" Accident summary for Northeast 823 from the Aviation Safety Network of the Flight Safety Foundation. In layman's terms, the captain lost spatial awareness when he entered the clouds seconds after takeoff, and therefore didn't detect or correct the airplane's deviation from its desired course. In popular culture The flight was the featured story in a book on aviation written by Alvin Moscow, Tiger on a Leash. Told from the hindsight of 1961, it discussed many aspects of passenger flight of the time.Kirkus Review: Tiger on a Leash The story of the crash was also featured in the TV series Mysteries at the Museum.

The term was coined by Richard Dorsett according to an interview with renowned cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling in Mythaxis Review. He said: \\"It was invented by my friend the late Richard Dorsett while the two of us were discussing a category of non-genre fantasy books that we had no name for. 'They're certainly not mainstream,' I said, and 'Why not slipstream?' he suggested, and I thought it was a pretty good coinage.\\" Bruce Sterling described it in an article originally published in SF Eye #5, in July 1989, as: \\"... this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel very strange; the way that living in the twentieth century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility.\\"  Concept  Slipstream fiction has consequently been described as \\"the fiction of strangeness\\" or a form of writing that makes \\"the familiar strange or the strange familiar\\" through epistemological and ontological questionings about reality. Science fiction authors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel, editors of Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology, argue cognitive dissonance is at the heart of slipstream, and it is not so much a genre as a literary effect, like horror or comedy. Similarly, Christopher Priest, in his introduction to Anna Kavan's genre-defying but arguably slipstream novel Ice, writes \\"the best way to understand slipstream is to think of it as a state of mind or a particular approach, one that is outside of all categorisation. ... slipstream induces a sense of 'otherness' in the audience, like a glimpse into a distorting mirror.\\"Kavan, Anna. Foreword. Ice. By Christopher Priest. Peter Owen Publishers.  Characteristics  Slipstream falls between speculative fiction and mainstream fiction. While some slipstream novels employ elements of science fiction or fantasy, not all do. The common unifying factor of these pieces of literature is some degree of the surreal, the not-entirely-real, or the markedly anti-real. According to Kelly and Kessel, however, there are three basic characteristics of a slipstream narrative: it disrupts the principle of realism; it is not a traditional fantasy story; and, it is a postmodern narrative. As an emerging genre, slipstream has been described as nonrealistic fiction with a postmodern sensibility. In 2007, the first London Literature Festival at the Royal Festival Hall held a Slipstream night chaired by Toby Litt and featuring the British authors Steven Hall and Scarlett Thomas. In her 2012 volume Walking the Clouds: An Anthology of Indigenous Science Fiction, Grace Dillon identifies a current of Native American Slipstream that predates and anticipates slipstream, with examples including Gerald Vizenor's \\"Custer on the Slipstream\\" (1978).

After attacks on and the murder of several white families the APLA was subsequently classified as a terrorist organisation by the South African National government and the United States, and banned. APLA was disbanded and integrated into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in June 1994. Etymology In 1968 the \\"Azanian People's Liberation Army\\" replaced defunct \\"Poqo\\" as the armed wing of the PAC. Its name was derived from Azania, the ancient Greek name for Southern Africa. Azania is the name that has been applied to various parts of southeastern tropical Africa. In the Roman period and perhaps earlier, the toponym referred to a portion of the Southeast African coast extending from Kenya,Richard Pankhurst, An Introduction to the Economic History of Ethiopia, (Lalibela House: 1961), p.21 to perhaps as far south as Tanzania. History =Formation and early resistance= Poqo was founded in 1961 following the massacre of PAC-led protestors at the hands of police outside the Sharpeville police station the previous year. Potlako Leballo, the chairman of the PAC at the time of the formation of its military wing in the 1960s, modelled APLA on the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with Templeton Ntantala as his deputy. Members of Poqo targeted the town of Paarl in the Western Cape on 22 November 1962, when a crowd of over 200 people armed with axes, pangas and other home-made weapons marched from the Mbekweni township into Paarl and attacked the police station, homes and shops. Two white residents, Frans Richard and Rencia Vermeulen were killed. This attack was followed by the murder of a family camping at Bashee River in the Transkei on 4 February 1963. Norman and Elizabeth Grobbelaar, their teenage daughters Edna and Dawn, together with Mr Derek Thompson, were hacked to death in their caravans. Leballo had planned a massive revolt for 8 April 1963, but Basotholand police managed to track down and raid the PAC's headquarters, seizing a complete lise of Poqo members. In the following government crackdown, nearly 2000 poqo members were sent to prison, nearly wiping out the entire organization. Consequently the poqo ceased to the an important particiapt in the anti-Apartheid struggle during the remander of the 1960s. In 1968, the Poqo was renamed to the APLA and unsuccessfully attempted to form diplomatic and political ties to foreign states and movements. It received some support from China, which attempted to shift the group toward Maoism. PAC leaders, which had been vehemently anti-communist, nevertheless accepted the aid by attempting to rationalize it as being due to the fact that the Chinese were \\"non-white\\" and that their value system had not been \\"tainted by European thought\\" as they deemed the South African Communist Party to have been. The result was the formation of a small Maoist faction within the APLA that contrasted the strong anti-communist currents within the PAC as a whole. However, the organization's ties with China were short-lived and the pro- Chinese members were soon after purged from the group. =Leadership struggles in exile= After the Soweto uprising in 1976, a number of students went into exile in APLA camps elsewhere on the African continent. In 1976, APLA received 500 recruits, including 178 Basotho, for a new Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), to be formed as an offshoot of the exiled-Basutoland Congress Party under the leadership of Matooane Mapefane, who was a senior instructor of APLA in Libya. Ntantala's original group of 70 APLA soldiers felt threatened by the influx of new recruits, leading Ntantala to attempt a coup against then commander, Potlako Leballo in Dar es Salaam. This was prevented by LLA soldiers, a move which exacerbated tensions within two PAC factions, the \\"Diplomat-Reformist\\" (DR) and \\"Maoist-Revolutionary\\" (MR) factions. Vusumzi Make's appointment as Leballo's successor sparked a mutiny at Chunya, an APLA camp in Tanzania, on 11 March 1980, during which several APLA forces were killed and the rest further factionalised and confined to different camps; many escaped to Kenya. Leballo himself relocated to Zimbabwe in late 1980 along with senior intelligence and air force personnel from the MR faction. Pressure from Tanzania, however, resulted in his deportation in May‚ÄìJune 1981, as well as the deportation or imprisonment of the others. Make was replaced by John Nyathi Pokela (who was released from Robben Island in 1980), but his ineffectual term of office was marred by further mutinies, executions and assassinations. Following Pokela‚Äôs death, Leballo made a comeback through support from Libya, North Korea and Ghana. After his sudden death in January 1986, the DR faction, outmaneuvered by the ANC, fell into disarray leaving behind the legacy of a semi-national socialist political front. =Attacks on white civilians= After 1986, APLA rejected the MR faction's concept of the guerrilla as a social reformer and instead adopted an ultimately disastrous rallying cry of \\"One Settler, One Bullet\\". In the 1990‚Äì94 period, the organisation became known for its attacks on civilians despite the progress in negotiations at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. In 1993, the APLA‚Äôs chief commander, Sabelo Phama, declared that he \\"would aim his guns at children - to hurt whites where it hurts most.\\" Phama proclaimed 1993 as \\"The Year of the Great Storm\\" and sanctioned the following attacks on civilians: *King William‚Äôs Town Golf Club on 28 November 1992, killing four people. *Highgate Hotel in East London on 1 May 1993, killing five people. *Saint James Church massacre in Kenilworth on 25 July 1993, killing 11 people during a church service. *Heidelberg Tavern Massacre in Observatory on 31 December 1993, killing four. *Mdantsane on 11 March 1994, killing three Iranians for being 'white'. APLA took responsibility for the attacks, stating that: \\"The men were shot to show there is no role in the new South Africa for any one of the race that invented apartheid or suppressed the black masses.\\" In total thirty-two applications were received for attacks on civilians. In these incidents, 24 people were killed and 122 seriously injured.TRC Final Report, 6:5:5 , as presented by the SABC and the South African History Archive. (SAHA) The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has presently charged that PAC- sanctioned action directed towards white South Africans were \\"gross violations of human rights for which the PAC and APLA leadership are held to be morally and politically responsible and accountable\\". =End of the armed struggle= In spite of their failure to achieve their goals at the negotiated settlements to end apartheid, the PAC decided to participate in the 1994 elections, and PAC leader Clarence Makwetu ordered APLA to end its armed struggle. =Post-1994= In 1994, APLA was disbanded and absorbed into the new South African National Defence Force, although members of the MR-faction refused to accept this agreement. Attempts by MR officers to regroup in Vietnam, North Korea, and China were unsuccessful, although links were maintained with the Tamil Tigers and Maoist groups in Nepal and India. Occasional propaganda leaflets distributed within South Africa focus on disparity of wealth and the issue of land.

The character was created by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, and first appeared in Green Lantern (Volume 2) #87 (December 1971/January 1972). Stewart's original design was based on actor Sidney Poitier. Publication history John Stewart debuted in Green Lantern 2011 vol. 2 #87 (December 1971/January 1972) when artist Neal Adams came up with the idea of a substitute Green Lantern. The decision to make the character black resulted from a conversation between Adams and editor Julius Schwartz, in which Adams recounts saying that given the racial makeup of the world's population, \\"we ought to have a black Green Lantern, not because we‚Äôre liberals, but because it just makes sense.\\" The character was DC's first black superhero. John Stewart has become a major recurring character in the Green Lantern mythos within the DC Universe. He became the primary character of Green Lantern vol. 2 from issues #182 through #200, when Hal Jordan relinquished his place in the Green Lantern Corps (1984‚Äì1986). He continued to star in the book when the title changed to The Green Lantern Corps from issue #201 to #224 (1986‚Äì1988). He would continue to make key appearances in Action Comics Weekly after The Green Lantern Corps' cancellation (1988). He starred in the comic Green Lantern: Mosaic, which DC spun out of Green Lantern vol. 3, with a four-part storyline titled \\"Mosaic\\" (issues #14‚Äì17). DC published 18 issues of the ongoing Green Lantern: Mosaic title between June 1992 and November 1993. John Stewart was featured as one of the lead characters on the television cartoon Justice League from 2001 until 2004. He continued to appear as a major character on the show's 2004‚Äì2006 sequel, Justice League Unlimited. In 2011, John Stewart starred in the New 52 relaunch of Green Lantern Corps alongside Guy Gardner, and became the sole lead character of the title from 2013 until the series' conclusion in 2015. Green Lantern Corps was replaced by Green Lantern: The Lost Army, which also stars John Stewart as the lead. Character biography =Early years= thumbleft John Stewart in Green Lantern Secret Files and Origins #4 (June 2005). Art by Andrew Dalhouse. John Stewart is an architect, later \\"retconned\\" into a veteran U.S. Marine from Detroit, Michigan, who was selected by the Guardians as a backup Green Lantern to then-current Green Lantern Hal Jordan, after the previous backup, Guy Gardner, was seriously injured after getting hit by a car while trying to save a civilian. Although Jordan objected to the decision after seeing that Stewart had a belligerent attitude to authority figures, the Guardians stood by their decision, and chided Jordan for his supposed bigoted outlook on the issue. Jordan explained that he just felt that even though Stewart might have the integrity for the task, he \\"obviously would have a chip on his shoulder bigger than the rock of Gibraltar.\\" Jordan's opinion was that Stewart's first mission began badly. His assignment was to protect a racist politician, and Stewart, while averting an accident, took advantage of the situation to embarrass Jordan in the process. When an assassin shoots at the politician, Stewart does not intervene with Jordan in response to the attack, which initially makes Stewart seem suspect. However, it turns out Stewart had good reasons for this apparent dereliction of duty because he was stopping a gunman from killing a police officer in the outside parking lot at the event while Jordan was pursuing a decoy. When Jordan confronts Stewart about his actions, Stewart explains that the politician had staged the attack for political advantage. Jordan then concludes that Stewart was an excellent recruit and has proven his worth. For some time, Stewart occasionally filled in as Green Lantern when Jordan was unavailable, including some missions of the Justice League. After Jordan gave up being Green Lantern in the 1980s, the Guardians selected Stewart for full-time duty. Stewart filled that role for some years. During that period he worked as an architect at Ferris Aircraft Company, battled many Green Lantern villains, and fought against the Anti-Monitor's forces during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. John was trained in usage of his power ring by Katma Tui, the Green Lantern of the planet Korugar. The duo went on many adventures together and eventually fell in love. Kat and John went on to serve within the Green Lantern Corps of Earth alongside Hal Jordan, Arisia, Kilowog, Salaak, and other alien Green Lanterns, during which time they were married. After John's ring was rendered powerless through the schemes of Sinestro, and Katma Tui was murdered at the hands of the insane Star Sapphire, Stewart's life began to unravel. First, he was falsely accused of killing Carol Ferris, Star Sapphire's alter ego, and then falsely accused of theft by South Nambia (a fictional nation within the DC universe similar to apartheid-era South Africa). Jailed and tortured in South Nambia for weeks, John freed himself with his old ring, now re-powered thanks to the efforts of Hal Jordan. In his escape, John inadvertently frees both a serial killer and a terrorist. When Jordan confronts John over his actions, the two friends come to blows until John realizes the \\"revolutionaries\\" he had been aiding intended to murder innocent civilians. =Cosmic Odyssey= Afterwards, John left Earth for space, where he participated in the Cosmic Odyssey miniseries event, and failed to prevent the destruction of the planet Xanshi by an avatar of the Anti-Life Equation. The incident earned him the ire of J‚Äôonn J‚Äôonzz the Martian Manhunter, who was with him at the time. This series of tragedies left John a shattered man on the brink of suicide and created the villainess known as Fatality. J'onn J'onzz has since, at least civilly, forgiven him. =Green Lantern: Mosaic= John Stewart as the mortal Guardian of the Universe, Master Builder John finally forgave himself for his past mistakes and grew into a stronger, more complex hero when he became the caretaker of the \\"Mosaic World\\", a patchwork of communities from multiple planets that had been brought to Oa by an insane Guardian who had invaded John's mind. Although bitter and sullen at his assignment at first, he overcame this and, using his formidable intellect and talent for unconventional thinking, Stewart forged the Mosaic into a new society and eventually became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe, known as the Master Builder. As his reward for this new level of awareness, John was reunited with his late wife, Katma Tui. However, tragedy struck once again and Hal Jordan, possessed by Parallax, destroyed both the Guardians and the Central Power Battery, robbing John of his newfound powers and his resurrected wife. =Darkstars and beyond= Following \\"Emerald Twilight\\" and the collapse of the Green Lantern Corps, Stewart was recruited by the Controllers to command the Darkstars, another interstellar peacekeeping force. Using the new resources at his command, Stewart evacuated the Mosaic cities from Oa prior to its destruction and served the Darkstars with distinction until he was crippled in battle with Grayven on the planet Rann. Stewart eventually regained the use of his legs as a parting gift from Jordan before Jordan sacrificed himself to destroy the Sun-Eater during the 1996 \\"The Final Night\\" storyline. As a result of Jordan healing him, he began to exhibit random bursts of energy from his hands that he was able to discharge on three different occasions. Though he had initially refused a new Green Lantern ring months prior, he eventually accepted a new one entrusted to Kyle Rayner by a time-lost Hal Jordan, and joined the Justice League to fill in for Rayner as he took an extended leave of absence from Earth.Green Lantern vol. 3 155‚Äì156 =Green Lantern: Rebirth= With the return of Hal Jordan and the Guardians, the Corps has been reorganized. Each sector of space now has two Green Lanterns assigned to it, and Stewart and Jordan now share regular duty for Earth's sector, 2814. After the dissolution of the Justice League in the aftermath of the events depicted in the 2004 miniseries Identity Crisis, and the destruction of their Watchtower headquarters on the moon, Stewart has begun playing a larger role in metahuman affairs, working with many former Justice Leaguers. During the \\"52\\" storyline, John Stewart alongside Hal Jordan are involved in one of the first post-Freedom of Power Treaty confrontations. After a battle with the Great Ten and Black Adam, John and Hal are escorted to Russian airspace by the Rocket Red Brigade.52 #6 (June 2006) During the opening One Year Later storyline of Green Lantern, Hal Jordan tells Green Arrow that John Stewart is on an off-world undercover mission. The details John Stewart disguised himself as the bounty hunter \\"Hunger Dog\\" to undercover in Europe. When John hears that Hal Jordan is being held captive by Amon Sur and Loragg, he goes off to rescue him. This led to a confrontation with Amon Sur, who turns out to be the son of their predecessor, Abin Sur. During the fight, Amon receives a ring from the Sinestro Corps and vanishes.Green Lantern vol. 4, #17 (February 2007) In Justice League of America vol. 2, #7, he and Wonder Woman designed one of the League's new headquarters, The Hall. John later resumes his role as the League's resident Green Lantern upon Hal Jordan's request. =Sinestro Corps War= In the Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special, the Green Lantern Corps are attacked by Bedovian, the sniper of the Sinestro Corps, who is capable of taking out a target from three sectors away, all from the inside of a red Sun-Eater. After Bedovian takes out several Green Lanterns, John Stewart uses his power ring as a scoped sniper rifle to track the nearby sectors. He eventually discovers Bedovian's hiding spot and shoots him. As Green Lantern Corps member were forbidden from killing sentient beings at that time, Bedovian survived the attack, as recently seen in the Blackest Night crossover. John and Guy Gardner are captured by Lyssa Drak and taken back to Qward, where the two Lanterns are held captive.Green Lantern vol. 4, #21 (July 2007)Green Lantern vol. 4, #22 (August 2007) Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free John and Guy from their nightmares, while the Lost Lanterns recover Ion. The earth-based Lanterns then return home, only to find that New Earth, as the center of the Multiverse, is the Sinestro Corps' next target.Green Lantern vol. 4, #23 (September 2007) The Sinestro Corps and the Manhunters invade Earth. The Cyborg Superman and Superboy-Prime attack Superman, while Hal confronts Parallax, who has possessed Kyle Rayner, just before the latter is about to kill Hal's family. John orders Guy to retrieve a painting by Kyle Rayner's mother. When Parallax absorbs Hal inside himself, John looks on with sudden shock. Guy returns and shoves the painting into Parallax's eyesight, allowing Hal to use it to help Kyle overcome his fears and expel Parallax. Now in its original form, Parallax is then contained by Ganthet and Sayd within the Power Batteries of Hal, John, Guy, and Kyle. Ganthet and Sayd then reveal that they are no longer Guardians. Ganthet gives Kyle a new power ring and asks Kyle to become a Green Lantern again, to which he agrees. The four then race off to finish the fight.Green Lantern vol. 4, #24 (October 2007) At Guy Gardner's suggestion, John and the other Lanterns use Warworld as a gigantic grenade, badly wounding the Anti-Monitor, who is then thrown into space by Superboy-Prime. John Stewart witnessed Guy being infected by the Sinestro Corps member who is a living virus, named Despotellis, and asked Soranik Natu to help Guy. Soranik used the Green Lantern Corps smallpox virus named Leezle Pon, who stops Despotellis.Green Lantern vol. 4, #25 (December 2007) John Stewart was later approached by the Guardians to become one of the Alpha Lanterns, a new division of the Corps devoted to the internal affairs of the Corps. Stewart, desiring more information about the secrecy of the forbidden prophecies, declined the offer, to the extreme disappointment of the Guardians.Green Lantern vol. 4, #27 (January 2008) It has also been revealed that John served in the Marine Corps as a sniper prior to becoming an architect.Green Lantern vol. 4, #26 (February 2008, on sale December 2007) While the idea of John being a former Marine was taken from the Justice League cartoon, the sniper angle is a new addition to the character's background. During his time in the Marines, John met the then young Hal Jordan when he was in the Air Force before they both join the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern vol. 4, #29 (March 2008) During the Rage of the Red Lanterns story arc, John Stewart is one of the guards assigned to escort Sinestro to Korugar to face execution. However, the Green Lanterns are ambushed by the Sinestro Corps and then the Red Lantern Corps under Atrocitus. The Green Lanterns are left to die in space after Atrocitus captures Sinestro, but they are saved by Saint Walker of the Blue Lantern Corps.Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns (October 2008) John, however, is infected with the Red Lanterns' rage. Saint Walker conjures up a blue energy construct of Katma Tui, who heals John and calms him by showing him a vision of flying with Katma. John later tells Kilowog that he is going to see Katma again, saying that \\"the universe said so\\". In that same issue, Fatality is converted into a Star Sapphire, and orders her ring to locate John Stewart.Green Lantern vol. 4, #36 (December 2008) When she tracks down John, she tells him she forgives him, and kisses him. Before departing, she encourages John to forgive himself for what happened to Xanshi.Green Lantern vol. 4, #41 (May 2009) =Trinity= Stewart appears in the Trinity series. He is the one to first attack the alien creature Konvikt, but when he's on the verge of defeating him, his concentration suddenly snaps, and starts muttering incoherently in binary code. A moment later, he spontaneously generates complex weapons from his body, by means unrelated to his ring. Later, he attempts to overexert himself to know how he generated those weapons by running a brutal training session against holographic Qwardian Thunderers, which does not work. He later shows Firestorm the machinery used to monitor the Cosmic Egg imprisoning Krona, but as he leaves again, he suffers from a relapse and start generating knives from his uniform, and it is revealed the entire system is broken. Later, on board the Antimatter Earth Crime Syndicate satellite, he again loses control and nearly brings down the satellite with his blasts. It is revealed these discharges are brought about due to John's absorption of a Qwardian superweapon, the Void Hound, which has been trying to escape its containment, or at least seize control of Stewart. After the sweeping, devastating effects of the spell engineered by Morgaine le Fey and Enigma, he is seen in an Earth under the control of a totalitarian Justice Society, where all Green Lanterns are forbidden to be. He eventually starts breaking down, and with the Void Hound gaining enough hold on him to force him to create a black hole which forces him back to Earth, he has no choice but to comply. The Void Hound is later revealed to be a servant of Krona, and its hold over John is broken when Krona is defeated. =Worlds Collide= After a massive battle between the JLA and the Shadow Cabinet, John chooses to stay with the League despite many of its members choosing to leave.Justice League of America vol. 2, #32 (April 2009) After Kimiyo Hoshi goes missing while tracking down Shadow Thief, John blackmails the armored vigilante Hardware into helping the team track her down. The League arrives in the Himalayas, discovering Kimiyo and Superman's friend Icon engaged in a fierce battle with the cosmic vampire known as Starbreaker.Justice League of America vol. 2, #33 (May 2009) The JLA defeats Starbreaker, and John takes a leave of absence to go to Xanshi.Justice League of America vol. 2, #34 (June 2009) =Blackest Night= When John visits the grave of planet Xanshi, thousands of black rings fly into the planetary debris, and reconstitute the entire planet.Green Lantern vol. 4, #44 (July 2009)Green Lantern vol. 4, #45 (August 2009) Xanshi itself then speaks to John, telling him \\"I can help you save them.\\" Against his better judgment, John descends to the planet's surface.Green Lantern vol. 4, #46 (September 2009) Once reaching the surface, John finds himself confronted by Katma Tui and the entire population of Xanshi as Black Lanterns. While battling them all, Katma tries to weaken John by claiming that he caused the planet's destruction. However, John, spurred on by Fatality's words, says that he wasn't the cause of it all and successfully fights off the Black Lanterns.Green Lantern vol. 4, #49 (December 2009) After escaping Xanshi's atmosphere, John realises that the planet is headed for Earth, along with every Black Lantern in the universe, and contacts Hal, warning him of the impending threat.Blackest Night #6 (December 2009) Later, John is saved by combined efforts of the various Lanterns corps, who had just arrived to battle the Black Lanterns.Blackest Night #7 (February 2010) =Brightest Day= In the events of Brightest Day, John is seen on Oa, supervising the demolition of the buildings left in ruins after the Black Lanterns attack, and planning the reconstruction. Suddenly, he is called to the Guardians' chamber, where they order him to join Alpha Lantern Boodikka in a mission to robot planet Grenda, Stel's homeworld, where the communications ceased abruptly without explanation, and Lantern Stel and the population are missing. John agrees and departs with Boodikka.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #48 (May 2010) After arriving on the planet, the two confirmed the Guardians report: the entire population has mysteriously disappeared. John asks Boodikka if something of her older self remains despite being turned into an Alpha Lantern, after she asks him why he refused to join the Alpha Lanterns. Boodikka responds that her changes are only physical, and she still has her former personality; John doubts this affirmation. The two discover what seems to be a Green Lantern House Sector, that, according to Boodikka, is not registered. After entering inside, they discovered Green Lanterns Horoq Nnot and Stel; the last one tells John he must flee from the planet immediately. Suddenly, Boodikka turns against John and attacks him; John fights back, but he's surrounded by more rogue Alpha Lanterns and is defeated. It's revealed that the Alpha Lanterns have begun a revolt against the rest of the Corps, and have allied themselves with the Cyborg Superman (now with an Alpha Lantern battery), taking control of Grenda to use the planet as their hidden base to turn Green Lanterns into Alpha Lanterns. John Stewart is last seen wounded and bleeding, being taken to Henshaw by Boodikka. Cyborg Superman then begins the cosmetic surgery to turn John into another Alpha Lantern.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #49 (June 2010) Before starting the operation, however, Henshaw connects Stewart's brain to his memories in order to see why he was turned into a cyborg. He also reveals to John, that, after being resurrected by the Manhunters after the Sinestro Corps War, he returned to Earth in the middle of the Blackest Night, and pleaded to the Black Lanterns (among them are the former crew of his space shuttle) and Nekron to kill him, only to discover that because he did not have a physical heart, he was invisible to them. Angered for being ignored by death itself, the Cyborg Superman encountered the mysterious hooded stranger who abducted the entities of the Emotional Spectrum. He convinced him that Ganthet has the power and knowledge to turn Alpha Lanterns into normal beings again. John realizes that Henshaw organized the revolt of the Alpha Lanterns with the sole purpose to attract Ganthet to the planet Grenda and forced him to turn Henshaw into a mortal being again. Kyle and Soranik burst into the lab and manage to rescue John, but Ganthet is captured.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #50 (July 2010) They hide in a cave, where John informs them about the Cyborg Superman's true plan. They also discover the missing robot inhabitants of the planet, trapped in the depths of the cave by Henshaw.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #51 (Aug. 2010) Mounting a defense, they battle against Henshaw and his forces, destroying the cyborg's body. Henshaw leaps into Boodikka's body, but her consciousness manages to defeat his, seemingly destroying him.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #52 (Sept. 2010) John later joins Kyle Rayner and Ganthet in a mission to the anti-matter universe, in order to save Soranik Natu. =War of the Green Lanterns= On their return to the matter universe, John and the others are affected by the return of Parallax to the Central Power Battery by Krona. Their previous experience with Parallax allows John, Kyle and Ganthet to escape its control, but they are forced to fight their fellow Green Lanterns. Affected by Parallax's fear powers, John and Kyle are forced to remove their rings and escape through Oa's underground.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #58 (March 2011) They then meet up with Guy and Hal, who has the rings of the other corps' leaders. John initially chooses Larfleeze's orange ring, but is convinced by Hal to use Indigo-1's ring instead due to the debilitating effects of the orange ring on the wearer's psyche.Green Lantern vol. 4, #65 (April 2011) When the corrupted Green Lanterns attack, John has difficulty channeling the various corps powers through his ring. Things are made worse when Mogo joins the attack.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #59 (April 2011) While Hal and Guy go to remove Parallax from the Central Power Battery, John and Kyle attempt to free Mogo from Krona's control. On the way, John attempts to stop the flow of tainted rings sent by Mogo, but fails. As he and Kyle head for Mogo's core instead, they discover residual Black Lantern energy around it. John absorbs the Black Lantern energy, along with all the Green Lantern energy, and regretfully uses it to destroy Mogo, knowing that they lack the time to heal Mogo before Krona uses it to 'recruit' a wave of reinforcement Green Lanterns.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #60 (May 2011) In the fallout, the two regroup with Hal, Guy and Ganthet, using the full power of the emotional spectrum to crack open the Battery and release Parallax. Their job done, the Lanterns regain their original green rings, in preparation for the final confrontation with Krona.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #10 (May 2011) Following the War's conclusion, John assists a new Green Lantern from Sector 282 'selected' during the period when Mogo was under Krona's control in adjusting to the power of her ring despite the possibility that she will not be allowed to keep it by assisting her in halting a war taking place in her sector, the original Lantern for that sector having died during the war. When John is able to help the two sides find a peaceful resolution to their conflict, his new student reflects that, despite John's reputation after destroying two worlds, she now knows that nobody could regret that action more than John himself.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2, #61 (July 2011) =The New 52= After Hal's expulsion and Kyle's departure, John joins Guy Gardner and others in investigating recent attacks in a distant sector of space, which are revealed to be the result of an old Guardian experiment. At one point, John is forced to kill Kirrt Kallak, another Lantern who was about to give in to torture and reveal the access codes to the Oan defence network.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #6 (February 2012) John is approached by the Alpha Lantern to arrest him for that murder.Green Lantern Corps vol 3, #8 (June 2011) He is found guilty for this crime and sentenced to death.Green Lantern Corps vol 3, #8 (July 2011) However Guy Gardner and other fellow Lanterns free him before the execution, resulting in the destruction of the Alpha Lanterns when the Green Lanterns refuse to allow John to be executed.Green Lantern Corps vol 3, #10 (August 2012) During the fights, the Alpha Lanterns (revealing to the reader that the Guardians set up these events as part of their plans to destroy the Corps) realize that all the Alpha Lanterns had become dangerously mentally unstable. Alpha Lantern Varix caused a reaction which killed all the Alpha Lanterns, including himself.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #12 (August 2012) During the \\"Rise of the Third Army\\" storyline, the Guardians contact John and state that Mogo's remains appear to be moving, The Guardians have come to the conclusion that Mogo is trying to reform and assign John to track it.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #13 (October 2012) While tracking the Mogo fragment's destination, he is discovered by Fatality, who is seeking a sundered love in danger.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #14 (November 2012) After they find Mogo's pieces ‚Äì realizing that the endangered love is the male and female elements of Mogo's personality trying to come back together- John figures out that the Guardians want to use Mogo.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #16 (January 2013) After the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, John begins a relationship with Fatality in-between on Mogo.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3, #20 (May 2013) After the invasion of Durlans, John discovered that a Durlan impersonated Fatality delectably throughout the months. John defeats the imposter and vows to search for the real Fatality.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #33 When John locates and reunites with her on the Durlan prison planet, Fatality attacks him. She revealed to him that the Zamarons had influenced her into becoming a Star Sapphire, forcing her to love him when she actually hated him. After John refuses to fight, Fatality leaves, telling John that he and the Star Sapphires are her enemies leaving John in sorrow.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #34 Following the \\"DC Rebirth\\" Event, John has become leader of the mixed Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps.\\"Hal Jordan and The Green Lantern Corps\\" vol. 1 #1 Powers and abilities As a Green Lantern, John Stewart is semi- invulnerable, capable of projecting hard-light constructions, flight, and utilizing various other abilities through his power ring which are only limited by his imagination and willpower. John's unique combination of military and architecture expertise makes him one of the Corps most exceptional members. Unlike other Green Lanterns, John doesn't wear a physical Green Lantern ring. Following an attack by The Legion of Doom, and a confrontation with Sinestro, John has a Green Lantern symbol branded on his finger which allows his body to act as his power ring, with his heart functioning as his power battery. John's physical power ring was destroyed when Sinestro infused him with the Ultraviolet Light of the Invisible Spectrum down to the cellular level. John was able to overcome Umbrax's influence and turned his UV Lantern Corp tattoo ring into a Green Lantern tattoo ring. The full nature and extent of his capabilities are unknown. *John Stewart's power ring physiology provides him with the abilities of all other Green Lanterns; flight, semi-invulnerability, energy projection, hard light construct creations, etc. *The ring is a weapon of the mind and powered by willpower, therefore it's only limited to the wearer's imagination. *Stewart was briefly taught by Ganthet how to reroute his mind to think in the 'language of the spheres', the first language of the universe, to evade telepathic detection by Fernus, the 'Burning Martian' identity of the Martian Manhunter; although the intensity of this method meant that John couldn't use it for more than a minute without burning his mind out, it has never been specified if this means that he cannot use it again after he tapped it to rescue the rest of the League from Fernus, or if he could use it at some future date if enough time has elapsed since his last use of it. *Like all Green Lanterns, Stewart's personality affects his ring's creations, giving them a solid, architectural quality. In Green Lantern: Rebirth, Hal Jordan remarks that \\"everything John builds is solid\\". He also remarked that Stewart is the best flyer in the Corps. *In Green Lantern (vol. 4) #26, it was shown that John's willpower can exceed the limits of the Green Lantern power ring, when he tried to recreate the Xanshi solar system; a feat that had not been depicted before this point. *John served as a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps and was an expert sniper. *When he temporarily used Indigo-1's ring as a member of the Indigo Tribe, John was capable of accessing the powers of all Lantern Corps rings in his vicinity, even managing to harness the power of the Black Lantern Corps by drawing on the residual Black Lantern energy around Mogo's core. John is not shown to be significantly affected by the Indigo Ring's mind-altering capabilities, although this could be because he was already capable of feeling compassion. *Due to his background in architecture, John's mastery of constructs is unique in comparison to other Lanterns. John is very precise and meticulous when using his ring, often building his constructs from the inside out. Every construct is foundationally sound, never hollow, forming every detail, every nut and bolt required for whatever he builds. *In Justice League Vol. 4 #15, John demonstrates just how abstract and precise he can be with his ring, creating kryptonite down to the isotopic level. In that same issue, John was able to reach into the body of a Dominantor and block oxygen from reaching their brain, knocking them out. As well as his obvious powers as a Lantern, John has also demonstrated a willingness to kill when he is certain the situation requires it, destroying Mogo in order to save the universe from the army of Krona-controlled Green Lanterns that Mogo would have created and later killing a fellow Lantern who was about to give in to torture and reveal vital information to their enemies. Other versions =Superman: Red Son= John Stewart is a member of the Green Lantern Marine Corps in Superman: Red Son.Superman: Red Son #3 =Justice= John appeared as a reserve Green Lantern in Justice. The Legion of Doom kidnapped all friends and relatives of the members of the League and mind-controlled the youngest generation of heroes to watch over them. John hadn't got a power ring at his disposal and was captured together with everyone else. Eventually Green Arrow and Black Canary found the place where the Legion's hostages were locked and handed Hal's Power Ring to John. John quickly used the Ring to destroy the mindworms controlling Supergirl, Batgirl, Robin and other young heroes and wipe the knowledge of the League's identities from their enemies' minds. Afterwards he sent the Ring back to Hal when his friend was fighting Sinestro. Justice #8 =Anti-Matter Universe= John, known now as Power Ring, is shown to be a member of the anti-matter universe Crime Syndicate that attempts to kidnap Power Girl in JSA: Classified. =Flashpoint= In the Flashpoint universe, John Stewart was a member of Team 7, an elite unit of soldiers led by Grifter. John and most of his teammates were ultimately killed during a botched attack on a terrorist training camp.Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance #2 (July 2011) =Justice League Beyond= The later years of the animated version of John Stewart are detailed in a flashback story in Justice League Beyond. It is revealed that sometime after the events of the series finale of JLU, Vixen was murdered by a vengeful Shadow Thief on the night he planned to propose to her, forcing John to partner with Hawkgirl and Adam Strange in order to bring him to justice. John ultimately killed Shadow Thief via a gunshot wound to the skull, and was thus forced to resign from the Green Lantern Corps (with his ring later passing to a Chinese teenager named Kai-Ro decades later). After retiring from the Justice League, he ended up marrying Shayera and together they had a child, Warhawk.Justice League Beyond #7‚Äì8 (May‚ÄìJune 2012) =Book of Oa= In the distant future, the Book of Oa shows that John will one day become a United States Senator and marry Fatality.Green Lantern vol. 5, #20 (May 2013) =Injustice: Gods Among Us= John appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Two series where he is summoned to Oa to join other Green Lanterns. He discovers the Guardians are dispatching Lanterns to Earth to retrieve Superman, who has taken control of the world and enforced peace. When Hal Jordan renegades and tries to leave, John joins the others in subduing him. However, this is a front: he later helps Hal escape, believing Superman has only good intentions. He goes back to Earth with Hal and discovers him and his Regime facing the Lanterns, with Sinestro and his Corps aiding the Regime. Once the Green Lanterns are taken prisoner John joins the Regime in enforcing peace around the world. Once an entire armada of Green Lanterns come back seven months later, Guy Gardner tries to make peace before things get out of hand. Shocked when Superman coldly rebuffs him by breaking his arm, John tries to stop the war to the best of his ability, though he is stopped by Sinestro. Having realized the Regime is not as well intentioned as he thought, John is killed by Sinestro to make sure Hal at least remains steadfast, with Guy taking the fall for John's death and being killed in turn by Hal. In other media =Television= * Stewart is one of the founding members of the Justice League, as seen in the animated series of the same name and its subsequent Justice League Unlimited voiced by Phil LaMarr. His characterization initially differed from the comics version by being a former United States Marine and having not been explicitly revealed to have studied architecture. Since then the comic book version has been updated to reflect these changes. In a development not seen in any other version of the Green Lantern mythos, Stewart's eyes glow green as a side effect of his fifteen years of exposure to the power ring's radiation; the glow fades when the ring runs out energy or if he is physically separated from the ring. Bruce Timm said this was done to give Stewart's face a more visually interesting look, as they decided to stick with the comic book tradition of depicting Stewart without a mask. By many accounts, the ring is also effective against yellow, contradicting an age-old weakness of the Lantern Corps. This is in continuity with the earlier appearance of Kyle Rayner on Superman: The Animated Series. There have been a few instances in the show of something yellow somehow counteracting the Lantern energy, including Jello in one humorous instance, but he is never explicitly shown to have the same weakness from the comics. Having two main characters with similar names (John and J'onn) can lead to minor confusion (Flash sometimes collectively refers to them as the two Johns); the closed captioning of some episodes misspell John's name as J'onn and vice versa. In the JL continuity, Stewart begins to develop an intimate relationship with Shayera Hol, and their feelings for each other persist even after the events of the JL triple episode \\"Starcrossed\\", and are slowly being rebuilt in the course of the Justice League Unlimited series (even though Stewart has at that time entered a relationship with Vixen), the result of which is John and Shayera's son, the future superhero Warhawk/Rex Stewart. In Justice League Unlimited, his appearance is slightly tweaked as he shows a bald head and a goatee beard. Stewart maintains much of a soldier's attitude in his personal life, being stern and no-nonsense, which is somewhat offset by his relationship with the Flash, with whom he is very close despite their radically differing personalities. He is also a close friend of former U.S.M.C. comrade Rex Mason and revealed in \\"Ancient History\\" is Bashari in Egypt, where he was Shayera/Princess Chay-Ara Hol's secret lover that was poisoned by Hath-Set. As a humorous facet, Stewart is also revealed to be a strong fan of the classic children's film Old Yeller. * Phil LaMarr reprised his role of Stewart in the Static Shock episode \\"A League of Their Own\\". He and the Justice League call in Static (also voiced by LaMarr) and Gear in order to help fight Brainiac. In \\"Fallen Hero\\", Stewart attacks Dakota. It turns out that Sinestro orchestrated an event that resulted in Sinestro stealing Stewart's battery source. Once this is found out, Static helps Stewart defeat Sinestro and reclaim his battery source. * Stewart appears in Young Justice, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He appears as a member of the Justice League. In the one-hour pilot episode, \\"Independence Day\\", John is shown working with Hal Jordan to contain Blockbuster after he has been defeated by Aqualad, Superboy, Robin and Kid Flash as well as carrying the non-flying mentors Aquaman, Batman, and Black Canary. In episode \\"Alpha Male\\", John is shown helping to rebuild Mount Justice after it is attacked by Red Torpedo and Red Inferno. In episode \\"Failsafe\\", a mind-training exercise conducted by Martian Manhunter, an illusory John and Hal are apparently vaporized by invading aliens. In episode \\"Agendas\\", John and Hal were convenes recruitment for the new Justice League members; he and Hal immediately dismiss the idea of adding Guy Gardner to the League. John is among the Leaguers brainwashed by Vandal Savage in \\"Usual Suspects\\" and \\"Auld Acquaintance\\". In \\"Alienated\\", as a result of his actions, he and several other members of the Justice League are forced to leave Earth and stand trial for hostile actions against alien planets that they committed while under Savage's control. In Season 3, it was revealed he is Black Lightning's ex-brother-in-law. * Stewart is referenced in Green Lantern: The Animated Series episode \\"Ranx\\". He is mentioned by Guy Gardner as the new Green Lantern of Sector 2814 after Gardner gets promoted to honor guard. Hal Jordan asks who the new Green Lantern is and Guy mentions his name is John Stewart. Hal responds \\"The fake news guy?\\", in reference to The Daily Show host Jon Stewart. According to Giancarlo Volpe, had the show not been canceled, John Stewart would've appeared in the Season Two premiere sent to capture Hal Jordan when he was framed by Sinestro for his crimes. * John Stewart makes cameo appearances in the Teen Titans Go! episodes \\"Real Boy Adventures\\" and \\"Orangins,\\" and is shown as one of the Justice League members captured by Darkseid in the episode \\"Two Parter.\\" * In the Arrow episode Elseworlds, the Barry Allen of Earth-90 indicates that on his Earth John Diggle is the Green Lantern. This is a nod to earlier behind the scenes discussions of possibly turning Diggle into John Stewart. Another nod takes place in the season seven episode \\"Spartan\\", where Diggle's stepfather is named Roy Stewart (portrayed by Ernie Hudson). In the end of the series finale episode, \\"Fadeout\\", an object falls from the sky. When Diggle goes to open the box, the item inside is not shown to the audience, but is glowing green, letting the audience assume that it's a power ring. * John Stewart appears in the Harley Quinn episodes \\"Devil's Snare\\" and \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\" as a member of the Justice League.https://www.superherohype.com/tv/477053-the-justice-league-arrives-in- harley-quinn-1-12-promo =Film= * In February 2007 it was announced that Warner Bros. Pictures hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film. George Miller signed to direct in September 2007. Titled Justice League Mortal, the script featured John Stewart as the Green Lantern, a part that was originally offered to Columbus Short.
