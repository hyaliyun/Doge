The owners of a taxi dance hall provide music and a dance floor for their patrons and taxi dancers.Cressey (1932), p. 3. In the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, when taxi dancing was at its peak, patrons of taxi dance halls would typically buy dance tickets for ten cents each.Freeland(2009), p. 192.Cressey (1932), p. 195. When they presented a ticket to a taxi dancer, she would dance with them for the length of a single song.Cressey (1932), p. 6. Taxi dancers earned a commission on every dance ticket that they collected.Cressey (1932), p. 27. The ticket-a-dance system was the centerpiece of the taxi dance halls. Taxi dance halls are vividly represented on the ouverture of Henry Miller novel Sexus, where the narrator falls in love with a taxi dancer after meeting her on a Thursday night, circa 1928. Origins and development The taxi dance hall is a uniquely American institution that was first introduced in 1913 within San Francisco's Barbary Coast neighborhood.Cressey (1932), p. 181. At that time reform movements were shutting down many bordellos and red-light districts within America's cities, and strength for Prohibition was gaining. In 1920, when the taxi dance halls entered their steep upward climb to popularity, prohibition was enacted and made serving alcohol in saloons, bars, and cafes illegal.Asbury(1933), p. 303. The taxi dance hall's roots can be traced to a number of earlier dance establishments. =Barbary Coast dance hall= Prior to the emergence of taxi dance halls in San Francisco, California, that city popularized a different form of dance hall called the Barbary Coast dance hall, or also called the Forty-Nine['49] dance hall. Forty-Niner is a term for the gold prospectors who came to California during the California Gold Rush circa 1849.Asbury (1933), p. 3. At the Barbary Coast dance halls, female employees danced with male patrons and earned their living on commissions paid for the drinks that they could encourage their male dance partners to buy.Cressey (1932), p. 179. These dance halls were representative of the Old West—noisy, rough, boisterous, and occasionally violent. As writer Will Irwin described: =Closed dance hall= But in 1913, San Francisco enacted new laws that would forbid dancing in any cafe or saloon where alcohol was served. The closure of the Barbary Coast dance halls quickly fostered a new kind of pay-to-dance scheme called the closed dance hall. The name was derived from the fact that female patrons were not allowed—the only women permitted in these halls were the dancing female employees.Report of Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco of California Civic League of Women Voters, p.14 A report from Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco Civic League of Voters states: Inside a closed dance hall, a dancer would earn her income by the number of tickets she could collect in exchange for dances. The management would typically pay the girls half the price of a dance ticket. With the closed dance hall, the centerpiece of the taxi dance hall—the ticket- a-dance system—was introduced.Cressey (1932), p. 181. Community groups began to oppose the closed dance halls, and in response to this growing political threat, these early taxi dance halls began to disguise themselves as dance schools. In 1921 the police commission ruled against employment of women as taxi dancers, and San Francisco's taxi dance halls were permanently shut down.Cressey (1932), p. 182. =Dance academies= Around the time that San Francisco's taxi dance halls were being shut down, the taxi dance hall was being reinvented in differing formats elsewhere in America. Dance academies, which were struggling to survive, began to consider the ticket-a-dance system.Cressey (1932), p. 183. Previous to the ticket-a-dance system, dance schools would use the line up plan to provide dance partners for their students. Female dance instructors would get in a line, and students would then dance with the next instructor in line. Students were not allowed to choose a female dance instructor for their practice dances. The first instance of the ticket-a-dance system in Chicago came from a description, given by Godfrey Johnson of Mader-Johnson Dance Studios: Other dance schools began to try the ticket-a-dance system as well. As a former proprietor of the Colonial Dancing Academy in Chicago states: Many dance academy proprietors, who were disturbed by the \\"hoodlum element\\" that the ticket-a-dance system attracted, were very reluctant to adopt the dance tickets. But a Greek immigrant, Nicholas Philocrates, perceived the power of this opportunity, and fully embraced the ticket-a-dance plan that he had seen on the West Coast in 1920.Cressey (1932), p. 186. Mr. Philocrates said: Though Philocrates describes his dance hall as a \\"school\\", he would soon be followed by other Greek immigrants who would open other taxi dance halls in Chicago that did not provide any instruction whatsoever.Cressey (1932), p. 188. Some historians consider Philocrates to be the father of the taxi dance hall. =Public ballrooms= Also at that time, many large cities like Chicago had large public ballrooms. The public ballrooms were struggling to survive, as they had difficulty attracting as many female patrons as male patrons.Cressey (1932), p. 189. Partially due to the large immigrant populations of that time, many of the neighborhoods where taxi dance halls would compete with public ballrooms had five times as many men as women.Cressey (1932), p. 5, 288. While the public ballrooms had few women and many might refuse to dance, the taxi dance halls had many eager female dance partners who would agree to \\"dance with all- comers\\" that held dance tickets. The new competition of the increasingly popular taxi-dance halls would cause many ballrooms to either adopt the ticket-a-dance system or go out of business. =Rise and fall from popularity= Taxi dance halls flourished in America during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1931 there were over 100 taxi dance halls in New York City, and between 35,000 and 50,000 men would go to these halls every week.Ronald VanderKooi, University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, March 1969. There were also establishments which offered male professional dancers to women such as Maxim's in New York, where dancer/actor Rudolph Valentino got an early start. By 1925, the taxi dance halls were coming under attack by reform movements that insisted on licensing, police supervision, and succeeded in closing down some taxi dance halls for lewd behavior. After World War II the popularity of taxi dance halls began to diminish. In the 1930s, 50 cities had taxi dance halls, but by 1954 that number dropped to just 6 cities. Only ten taxi-dance halls remained in New York City by 1952.Clyde Vedder, \\"Decline of the Taxi- Dance Hall\\", Sociology and Social Research, 1954. Most of the taxi-dance halls disappeared by the 1960s. Many historians say that the return of the saloon and the cocktail lounge of post-Prohibition America contributed to the demise of the taxi dance hall. Today some cities still have clubs where female employees can be hired to dance with patrons. These clubs no longer use the ticket-a-dance system, but have time-clocks and punch-cards that allow the patron to pay for the dancer's time by the minute. The clock used by the cashier to determine the cost of time spent with a hostess is often set a few minutes later than the clock used to print the checkout time on the ticket, thus fraudulently increasing revenues for the establishment and hostess alike. Particularly accommodating hostesses often expect tips equivalent to the amount charged for their time. Some of these modern dance clubs exist in the same buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. The Dreamland club of Los Angeles was such an establishment. In the 1930s it was called Roseland Roof, and was owned by the Fenton brothers. When the Fenton brothers sold the club in 1981, the new buyers renamed the club to Dreamland, and continued taxi dancing in its original ballroom. These latter day establishments, including Starlight and Fantasy, are called Hostess Clubs.Evan Wright, \\"Dance With A Stranger\\", LA Weekly, January 1999 Patrons Paul G. Cressey's book, entitled The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life, gives a history of taxi dance halls, with interviews with taxi dancers and patrons. Cressey describes the phenomena as in terms of the human needs of American city dwellers in the early 20th century.Cressey (1932), p. 109. He listed nine categories to describe the types of patrons: *Racial or ethnic groups denied acceptance elsewhere.Cressey (1932), p. 109. *Caucasian immigrants, frequently from a European country. Italians, Poles, Greeks, and Jews predominated.Cressey (1932), p. 110-114. *Older men, approaching fifty, who want to rival younger men in courting young women. They were sometimes divorced, widowers, or deserters.Cressey (1932), p. 114-117. *Married men whose marriages are suffering, seeking clandestine adventures.Cressey (1932), p. 117-120. *Lonely, isolated strangers who might be from a rural area or smaller city, and are new to the ways of the city.Cressey (1932), p. 120-121. *The footloose globetrotter who has a very mobile lifestyle.Cressey (1932), p. 121-123. *The slummer, men of higher incomes who wish to see how the other half lives.Cressey (1932), p. 123-126. *Men who suffer from physical abnormalities or disabilities.Cressey (1932), p. 126-128. *The fugitive, someone who might have a criminal background or suffers from local condemnation.Cressey (1932), p. 128-129. Cressey goes on to describes the male patrons of taxi dance halls as being a varied and occasionally motley crew: In general, patrons were rarely businessmen or professional people, but were typically skilled or semi-skilled workers from the lower middle class. Frequently the patrons experienced social obstacles that prevented them from seeking feminine company through more traditional means. For the socially ostracized, the taxi dance hall became oasis where they could temporarily experience a sense of equality, recognition, and sometimes a fantasy of romance.Cressey (1932), p. 129-130. For others of a more individualized nature, the taxi dance hall became an interesting diversion that allowed dancing and feminine company without the restrictions of more traditional customs. Cressey interviews a patron [case #42] who describes: He continued to describe his aims: Dancers =Backgrounds of the dancers= During the 1920s the ages of taxi dancers ranged from 15 to 28 years, and two-thirds of taxi dancers came from homes in which the financial support of a father had been removed. They were occasionally runaways from their families, and it was not unusual for taxi dancers to be from homes where the parents had separated. And despite their young age, two-fifths of taxi dancers had been previously married, but were no longer. Many times the dancers were immigrants from European countries such as Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Various cultural conflicts would arise between parents and their dancing offspring, especially if the parents were from rural areas. For dancers of an immigrant family, the dancer was often the financial support of the family. When a girl supplanted the parent or parents as breadwinner, sometimes the dancer would assume an aggressive role in the family by \\"subordinating the parental standards to her own requirements and demands\\". These conflicts in values between dancers and their parents frequently caused the dancers to lead so-called \\"double lives\\", denying that they worked at a taxi-dance hall. To further this divide, the girls would sometimes adopt aliases so that their activities might not reach their families' ears. When parents found out, there were three typical outcomes—the girl gave up her dancing career, the girl left home and became estranged from the family, or the family accepted the girl's conduct, however reluctantly, due to financial necessity. Despite the frequent hardships, many of the dancers seemed to enjoy the lifestyle as they adopted a pursuit of what Cressey calls \\"money, excitement, and affection\\". Within his book, Cressey gives scores of quotes from taxi dancers who speak very favorably about their experiences at a taxi-dance hall. One dancer [case #15] from the 1920s describes her start at a taxi-dance hall. And yet another dancer from Chicago [case #11] spoke very positively of her experiences: =Vocabulary of the dancers= The special vocabulary of the dancers is not only a form of communication, but also helps describe the dancers as it reflects their judgments, activities, and interests. Here are some example that Cressey lists in his book. * Black and Tan – A colored and white cabaret * Buying the groceries – Living in a clandestine relationship * Class – Term used by Filipinos to denote the taxi-dance halls * Fish – A man whom the girls can easily exploit for personal gain * Fruit – An easy mark * Hot stuff – Stolen goods * Make – To secure a date with * Mark – A person who is gullible and easily taken advantage of * Monkey-chaser – A man interested in a taxi dancer or chorus girl * Monkey shows – Burlesque shows with chorus girls * Nickel- hopper – A taxi dancer * On the ebony – A taxi-dance hall or taxi dancer having social contacts with men of races other than white * Opera – Burlesque show * Paying the rent – Living in a clandestine relationship * Picking up – Securing an after-dance engagement with a taxi dancer * Playing – Successfully exploiting one of the opposite sex * Professional – A government investigator. One visiting the taxi-dance hall for ulterior purposes * Punk – A novitiate; an uninitiated youth or young girl, usually referring to an unsophisticated taxi dancer * Racket – A special enterprise to earn money, honestly or otherwise * Shakedown – Enforced exaction of graft Cultural forces At the start of the 20th century, the United States would for the first time have more inhabitants living within its cities than in rural and small-town areas. Cities were experiencing extreme growth; indeed, Chicago's population doubled between 1900 and 1930. Many young men and women were leaving their rural and small-town neighborhoods for the same promise of adventure that the Old West had previously provided. At this time, America was experiencing a flood of male-dominated immigration. Entertainment in America's cities was becoming a big business. New forms of mass entertainment were the baseball stadium, the football stadium, the amusement park, and the motion picture theater. Cressey and other sociologists like Ernest W. Burgess came to see taxi dance halls, and these other new forms of mass entertainment, as \\"commercializing the human interest in stimulation\\". For this uprooted culture, cities provided a type of anonymity that was not found in their previous rural and family-oriented neighborhoods. Once inside a city, young men and women were free to do as they pleased without moral criticism from their families or neighbors. Cressey felt that cities became \\"inhabited by rootless, detached people who connect with each other primarily on the basis of mutual exploitation\\". The taxi dance hall was just such a place where very different people from very different backgrounds—patrons and dancers—would meet for temporary and unlikely alliances. Frequently inside the taxi dance hall, the human needs of unassimilated males would meet the economic needs of taxi dancers. Near the time when Cressey finished his book in 1932, he noticed reform movements were attempting to shut down the taxi dance halls.Freeland (2009), p. 195. Cressey was disturbed by the fact that if taxi dance halls were eliminated without appropriate substitutes, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and possibly find self-destructive forms of expression. For Cressey, the taxi dance hall became a symptom of the isolation, loneliness, and alienation that plagues many cities.  Lap dancing Taxi dancing is often viewed as the parent phenomenon of lap dancing, and indeed there are many similarities.Judith Lynne Hanna, Naked Truth: Strip Clubs, Democracy, and a Christian Right, University of Texas Press, 2012, p. 136 Like the taxi dancer, the lap dancer provides her service only for the length of a single song.Freeland (2009), p. 194. It also received complaints from the community—bringing up the same controversies concerning morality, touching, and government regulation. However, decades after the taxi dance halls of the 1920s had been maligned by reformists, a California State judge in 1999 overruled a law prohibiting taxi dancing while stating that \\"taxi dancing is an established tradition in America that has gone on since the 1920s\\". The \\"fantasy of romance\\" also plays a role in both taxi dancing and lap dancing. Edward Fenton, a former owner of a large taxi dance hall, Roseland Roof, was interviewed in 1999 about the taxi dancing scene during the 1930s. When asked about the taxi dancers' patrons, Fenton replied: \\"The customer was lonely, that's the word. The club brought in lonesome people. They came here to meet with girls and carry on a secret romance\\". But when asked if he was implying that the customers had sexual affairs with the taxi dancers, Fenton replied: \\"No. I didn't say that... the customer lived in a fantasy.\\" Similarly, today's patrons of lap dancing sometimes discuss their experiences within Internet forums, and even a quick read of these forums reveals that they also sometimes have feelings of romance for dancers whom they refer to as an ATF, an acronym for All Time Favorite., Strip Club Forum, myRedBook, November 2007 During a 2002 interview for San Francisco Magazine, a lap dancer for the Mitchell Brothers strip club described the mindset of some patrons: Sociologist Paul Cressey may have prophesied the invention of lap dancing some 80 years ago when he suggested that if taxi dancing were to be eliminated, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and find more extreme forms of expression.

The freeway enters Gallup twenty miles (32 km) later paralleling the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway's southern transcontinental mainline. Leaving Gallup the now more easterly I-40 passes to the north of Fort Wingate and part of the fragmented Cibola National Forest before crossing the North American continental divide at an elevation of , with stratovolcano Mt. Taylor towering to the east. The highway traverses more of the Navajo Reservation and the Cibola Forest before turning southeast and crossing a malpaís. After serving interchanges near Grants, the freeway, coinciding with the northern boundary of El Malpais National Monument, crosses another malpaís, turns east and enters the Acoma Indian Reservation, home of the Acoma Pueblo. The route leaves the Acoma Indian Reservation with Mt. Taylor to the north and enters the Laguna Pueblo. Near the interchange with New Mexico State Road 6 (NM 6) the railway line that accompanies much of the route from the Arizona border diverts to the south while the freeway turns east by northeast towards Albuquerque. The route departs the Laguna Pueblo, briefly transits the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation (a chapter of the Navajo Nation), crosses the Rio Puerco and begins a steep climb to the top of a mesa marked by several small cinder cones overlooking the Rio Grande rift and Albuquerque. From Laguna to the Route 66 Casino, I-40 has at-grade intersections with a number of ranch access roads in violation of Interstate Highway standards. These intersections are a vestige that remain from the conversion of US 66 to I-40 during the latter part of the 20th century. =Albuquerque Metro Area= Interstate 40 diverges from the former US 66 alignment (Central Avenue) at an interchange with Atrisco Vista Boulevard on the West Mesa that overlooks Albuquerque. I-40 descends Nine Mile Hill as it enters the city of Albuquerque, and intersects 98th Street, Unser Boulevard (NM 345) and Coors Boulevard (NM 45) before crossing the Rio Grande. The freeway then skirts the northern edge of downtown Albuquerque before intersecting Interstate 25 at a 5-level stack interchange (Big I). East of I-25, I-40 continues east, then turns southeast passing through Uptown before intersecting Old US 66 (now signed as NM 333/Central Avenue) at Tramway Boulevard (NM 556) as it leaves Albuquerque and enters Tijeras Canyon. This section of I-40 is also referred to as the Coronado Freeway. =Albuquerque to Texas= I-40 in eastern New Mexico Club Cafe sign near Santa Rosa, exit 273 (1987 photo) East of Albuquerque, Interstate 40 crosses the Sandia–Manzano Mountains by traversing Tijeras Pass, reaching its highest point of 7,200 feet at Sedillo Ridge. Continuing east, I-40 descends out of the mountains and into the Estancia Valley while passing through the town of Edgewood (m.m. 187). The highway continues east across the Estancia Valley, passing through Moriarty (m.m. 194). Before reaching Clines Corners, I-40 ascends into the Pedrenal Hills, a region of hills and low-level ridgelines averaging around 7,000 feet in elevation. East of Clines Corners,( m.m. 217) I-40 gradually descends from the Pedrenal Hills region and into the High Plains of eastern New Mexico. At Santa Rosa (m.m. 273) I-40 crosses the Pecos River, and then continues east- northwastward co-signed with US 54 to Tucumcari. At Tucumcari, I-40 diverges from US 54 and turns eastward and skirts the northern edge of San Jon before reaching the Texas state line at Glenrio. History Planning and construction of Interstate 40 through New Mexico began shortly after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 created the Interstate Highway System. First sections of I-40 through the state were completed by 1960 including a short section west of Tucumcari in Quay County, from a point just west of Santa Rosa west past Clines Corners to just east of Moriarty, along with a section on the east side of Albuquerque and another section from near Cubero to Grants, which included a new spur route connecting the Interstate Highway with U.S. 66 on that city's east side. Construction of I-40, generally paralleling the existing U.S. 66 in some sections and replacing the older route in others, was hobbled for a few years during this decade by the New Mexico Legislature's passage of an Anti-Bypassing Law that prohibited the construction of an interstate bypass around a city or town opposed to it. That law was repealed in 1966 following a threat of loss of federal funds and most New Mexico cities along I-40, I-25 and I-10 then worked out agreements with state and federal highway officials in determining where the bypass routes around their municipalities should be located. By the end of the 1960s, most rural sections of I-40 were completed across the state with the largest exception being a stretch east of Tucumcari to the Texas border at Glenrio, where traffic was diverted to the old U.S. 66. That section of highway by this time became locally and nationally known as \\"Slaughter Lane\\" due to tremendous amounts of traffic for a two-lane highway along with rough and narrow paving which led to numerous injury and fatal traffic accidents that reached epidemic numbers in 1968 and 1969. Construction on this section of I-40 was held up by a dispute at San Jon concerning a proposed routing of I-40 bypassing that city to the north by some five miles (8 km), which was resolved in November 1969 when federal and state officials agreed to bring the bypass closer to the city along its northern limits. However, aside from a few small villages such as Montoya, Newkirk and Cuervo in the eastern portion of the state and Laguna, Budville and Cubero to the west, no major bypasses had been entirely completed in New Mexico so traffic was still diverted over the U.S. 66 routes through each of those cities. In 1970, I-40 was entirely completed through the city of Albuquerque. Other bypasses were completed around various cities through the state including San Jon (1976) and Tucumcari (1981), Santa Rosa (1972), Moriarty (1973), Grants (1974) and Gallup (1980).

It has its headquarters in Kampala. The Uganda Red Cross the biggest indigenous humanitarian organization in Uganda. History of the Uganda Red Cross  It started as a branch of the British Red Cross in 1941. In 1964 under an act of Parliament, the Uganda Red Cross Constitution was adopted bringing into existence the Uganda Red Cross Society. A year later in 1965, the Society was admitted as a member of the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Uganda Red Cross Society has continued to grow over the years and it now has 51 branches and 30 sub- branches spanning the whole of Uganda. The National Society also works with a number of partners in the execution of its mission. These include the Government of Uganda, United Nations agencies, international funding agencies, companies and practicing sister Red Cross National Societies.  Credo  Uganda Red Cross workers carrying an injured person on a stretcher. The purpose of the Uganda Red Cross society is to provide an empowered, healthy and self-sustaining community that responds to the needs of its most vulnerable. Its mission is to be a leading humanitarian agency in Uganda in saving lives, supporting livelihoods and promoting human dignity. Principles The work is guided by the seven fundamental principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movements: # Humanity: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavors, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace among all peoples. # Impartiality: It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress. # Neutrality: In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature. #Independence: The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement. # Voluntary Service: It is a voluntary relief organization not prompted in any manner by desire for gain. # Unity: There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory. # Universality: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide. The Uganda Red Cross Society operates throughout the country through its 51 branches and several sub branches.

Goldstein and O'Neil had a long rivalry concerning the outcome of annual Academy Awards. Goldstein left the paper in 2012 after a change in management. Rob Schneider conflict In his January 2005 Oscar preview, Goldstein commented that that year's Best Picture nominees were \\"ignored, unloved and turned down flat by most of the same studios that ... bankroll hundreds of sequels, including a follow-up to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, a film that was sadly overlooked at Oscar time because apparently nobody had the foresight to invent a category for Best Running Penis Joke Delivered by a Third-Rate Comic.\\" Schneider retaliated by placing an ad in the Los Angeles Times two weeks later, commenting that Goldstein was unqualified to opine this because he had never won the Pulitzer Prize, or any other journalistic award, because, he remarked, \\"they haven't invented a category for Best Third-Rate, Unfunny Pompous Reporter Who's Never Been Acknowledged by His Peers.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times intervened by saying that, \\"Schneider can dish it out, but he can't take it.\\" Then responded,\\" He's not so good at dishing it out either.\\" Ebert went on to point out on his site that Goldstein won a National Headliner Award, a Los Angeles Press Club Award, a RockCritics.com award, and the Publicists' Guild award for lifetime achievement. Ebert continued in his review: \\"Schneider was nominated for a 2000 Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor, but lost to Jar-Jar Binks.

It is often referred to as \\"Russian\\" and does have historical and liturgical ties to the Russian Orthodox Church; nevertheless, like all the other monastic settlements on Mount Athos, the monastery is under the direct ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and all its monks are citizens of Greece, usually naturalized. History The monastery was founded by several monks from Kievan Rus in the 11th century, which is why it is known as \\"Rossikon\\". It has been inhabited by mainly Russian monks in certain periods of its history. It was recognized as a separate monastery in 1169. Russian pilgrim Isaiah confirms that, by the end of the 15th century, the monastery was Russian. The monastery prospered in the 16th and 17th centuries being lavishly sponsored by the tsars of Moscovy and Serbian dukes of Kratovo, but it declined dramatically in the 18th century to the point where there were only two Russian and two Bulgarian monks left by 1730. The construction of the present monastery on a new site, closer to the seashore, was carried out during the first two decades of the nineteenth century, with the financial help of the ruler of Moldo-Wallachia, Skarlatos Kallimachos. Russian monks numbered 1,000 in 1895, 1,446 in 1903, and more than 2,000 by 1913. During the Tatar yoke in Russia, most of the monks were Greeks and Serbs. The monastery occupies the nineteenth rank in the hierarchical order of the twenty Athonite monasteries. It is coenobitic (i.e., it is a communal monastic life). It also contains four sketes. In 1913, the monastery was the site of a raging theological argument (Imiaslavie) among Russian monks, which led to tsarist Russian intervention and the deportation of approximately 800 of the monks on the losing side of the debate. The Monastery of St Panteleimon was repeatedly gutted by fires, most famously in 1307 (when Catalan mercenaries set it aflame) and in 1968. The first Russian leader to visit the monastery was President Vladimir Putin on September 9, 2005. In the modern era Today, the monastery features the architecture of a small town, with buildings of various heights and many domes. It is the largest of the monasteries on the peninsula. Although destroyed by a fire in 1968, one wing of the monastery was used as the guest quarters, with a capacity of 1,000 monks. The monastery's katholikon (main church) was built between 1812–1821 and is dedicated to St. Panteleimon. It features the same style found in all the Athonite churches. Aside from the katholikon, the monastery has many smaller chapels. The library is housed in a separate building in the monastery's court. It contains 1,320 Greek manuscripts and another 600 Slavonic ones, as well as 25,000 printed books. In addition, the library has a few priceless relics, such as the head of Saint Panteleimon, one of the most popular saints in Russia. The 19th- century monastery bells are said to be the largest in Greece. There is a daughter community at the monastery at New Athos, Abkhazia. Church of St. Nicetas is a mission (metochion) of the Rossikon in downtown Moscow After the transfer of Athos to the Kingdom of Greece in 1912, and especially with the start of World War I in 1914, the stream of pilgrims and monks from Russia was disrupted and later was strictly controlled by the government of Greece until the collapse of the USSR in 1991. As a result, the number of Russian monks in the monastery and on Mount Athos generally, was reduced from several thousand in the 1900s to 13 in the early 1970s. In the 1990s, Greece relaxed its restrictive policy and the monastery has since undergone a relative revival. As of May 2016, there are approximately 70 Russian and Ukrainian monks.

Under command of Major General Willis D. Crittenberger, the IV Corps took part in the fighting through the summer of 1944 as the Fifth Army, under the command of Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, and the British Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Oliver W. H. Leese, advanced north to the River Arno. In the autumn and winter of 1944 the IV Corps formed the central wing of the Fifth Army's sector, taking the major role in the Fifth Army's assault on the Gothic Line in the central Apennine Mountains, fighting to break through to the Lombardy plains beyond.Clark, 2007 (1950).Moraes, 1966.Crittenberger, 1952. In the spring of 1945 the corps, still the Fifth Army's central sector, took part in the successful Italian spring offensive breaking out of the Apennines to outflank the units of the German Tenth and Fourteenth Armies defending Bologna forming a pincer with the Eighth Army on the right to surround them, and then driving on to the River Po and finally Verona and Brescia. The corps was inactivated on 13 October 1945, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, it was reactivated again at Birmingham, Alabama, in 1958 and inactivated at Birmingham in 1968.Ibidem Wilson, 1999.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1884 to 1892 for the Detroit Wolverines, Baltimore Monumentals, St. Louis Browns, Pittsburgh Burghers, Cincinnati Kelly's Killers, and Washington Senators. Robinson was a starter for St. Louis Browns teams that won four consecutive American Association pennants and the 1886 World Series. While playing for the Browns, he set the major league record with 116 walks in 1888 and broke his own record with 118 walks in 1889. During his peak years from 1887 to 1890, Robinson drew 472 free passes (427 walks and 45 times hit by pitch) and 400 hits in 2,115 plate appearances, giving him a \\"free pass\\" percentage of .223 and an on-base percentage of .412. His Offensive WAR ratings of 3.8, 3.7 and 3.6 ranked sixth in the American Association in 1886 and 1887 and eighth in 1888. Early years Robinson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859. He came from a poor background, left home at a young age and moved to Boston where he played sandlot baseball. Professional baseball =Detroit and Baltimore= In August 1882, Robinson was playing minor league baseball in Natick, Massachusetts, when he was given a try-out with the Detroit Wolverines who were in the midst of a six-game losing streak against Providence and Boston. Robinson made his major league debut on August 24, 1882, in the Wolverines' final game at Boston. He remained with the team for the remainder of the 1882 season, appearing in 10 games at shortstop, one as an outfielder and one as a pitcher. After his short stint with Detroit in 1882, Robinson spent the 1883 season in the minor leagues playing for the East Saginaw Grays in the Northwestern League. He played shortstop and compiled a .215 batting average for East Saginaw. In 1884, Robinson returned to a major league with the Baltimore Monumentals of the Union Association. He played 71 games at third base for the Monumentals, but also demonstrated versatility by playing 14 games at shortstop, 11 games at catcher, and 11 games as a pitcher. He compiled a .267 batting average, led the league with 37 walks, and ranked fourth in the league with 101 runs scored. As a pitcher, he compiled a 3-3 record with a 3.48 earned run average (ERA), pitched three complete games, and led the Union Association with eight games finished as a relief pitcher. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Robinson \\"the best all-around player in the Union Association.\\" =St. Louis Browns= 1885 season In December 1884, after the Baltimore Monumentals disbanded, Robinson had offers from multiple teams but signed with the St. Louis Browns, the team that later became the St. Louis Cardinals, for $2,100.Cash, Before They Were Cardinals, p. 98. The Browns had finished in fourth place in 1884, and Robinson was one of the final additions to a team that went on to win four consecutive American Association pennants under player-manager Charles Comiskey from 1885 to 1888. During the 1885 season, Comiskey made use of Robinson's versatility, positioning him in the outfield for 52 games, second base for 19 games, catcher for five games, third base for two games, and even one game at first base. He also scored five runs in the 1885 World Series. 1886 and 1887: peak seasons Old Judge baseball card of Robinson In 1886, Robinson became the Browns' starting second baseman, a position he held for the next four years. Robinson had a good year at the plate in 1886, batting .274 with 71 RBIs. He ranked second in the league in times hit by pitch (15), fourth in stolen bases (51), fifth in bases on balls (64), seventh in times on base (211), eighth in on-base percentage (.377) and ninth in doubles (26). Applying the modern measure of Wins Above Replacement (WAR), Robinson had the best season of his career in 1886 with an Offensive WAR of 3.8, sixth best in the American Association. Robinson also played a key role in helping the Browns win the 1886 World Series with a post-season batting average of .316, three RBIs and five runs. During the 1887 season, Robinson compiled career highs with 75 stolen bases, a .305 batting average, a .445 on-base percentage, 74 RBIs, 32 doubles and 17 times hit by pitch. His Offensive WAR rating of 3.7 is the sixth highest in the American Association for 1887. He also posted a .326 batting average in the 1887 World Series. 1888 and 1889: master of the free pass Prior to 1880, nine balls (pitches outside the strike zone) were required for a batsman to draw a walk, and the major league record was 29 walks in a season. The number of balls required to draw a walk was progressively reduced to eight balls in 1880, six in 1884, five in 1887, and, finally, four in 1889. Robinson was one of the first players to exploit fully the new rules governing bases on balls. In 1887, his 92 walks and 17 times hit by pitch elevated his on-base percentage to .445. Then, in 1888 and 1889, Robinson became the master of the free pass. He set a new major league record in 1888 with 116 walks and broke his own record with 118 walks the following year. Robinson actually tallied more walks (234) than hits (199) during the 1888 and 1889 seasons. His combined batting average in 1888 and 1889 was an anemic .219, but his 234 walks (and willingness to be hit by a pitch, a category in which he was a league leader five times) turned him into a potent offensive weapon with a .389 on-base percentage over the two seasons combined. His .400 on-base percentage in 1888 was the highest in the American Association. On strike in 1889 On May 2, 1889, Robinson began a strike that was the talk of baseball for a few days. Shortly before a game, team manager Charles Comiskey told Robinson to get a pair of padded playing trousers, as the trousers he was wearing were too small for him. Robinson sent a boy to retrieve the padded trousers from his room across the street from the ball park. Robinson gave the boy a note of explanation to show the gate keeper upon his return. When the boy returned, the gate keeper adamantly refused to admit the boy, saying he had strict instructions from the owner Chris von der Ahe not to admit anybody without a ticket. On learning what had happened, Robinson called the gate keeper and angrily berated him. The gate keeper was reduced to tears and complained to von der Ahe. The owner confronted Robinson and gave him a tongue-lashing in front of teammates and spectators seated in the grandstand. Robinson responded in kind, and von der Ahe imposed a $25 fine against Robinson. Robinson apologized for his angry outburst to the gate keeper, but asserted that the fine was unjust and refused to travel to Kansas City with the team unless the fine was removed. Initially, Robinson's teammates supported him and refused to board the train as well, but under threat of being fined themselves the other players took a later train. Robinson refused to return to the team until the fine was remitted, and von der Ahe announced that he would increase the fine by $25 for each day that Robinson failed to report. After a few games without Robinson, von der Ahe announced that a deal had been worked out between Comiskey and Robinson. Von der Ahe conceded that he \\"acted hastily\\" in berating Robinson on the bench. An adjustment was reached on the amount of the fine, and Robinson agreed to return to work. However, ill feeling between Robinson and von der Ahe persisted and contributed to Robinson's decision to move to the Players' League in 1890. =Players' League= When Robinson jumped to the Players' League in 1890, playing for the Pittsburgh Burghers, the gap between Robinson's batting average and on-base percentage grew to a remarkable 205 points. During that season, Robinson had 70 hits for a .229 batting average, but his 101 bases on balls elevated his on-base percentage to .434, fourth highest in the Players' League. Over the four years from 1887 to 1890, Robinson drew 472 free passes (427 walks and 45 times hit by a pitch) and only 400 hits in 2,115 plate appearances, giving him a \\"free pass\\" percentage of .223 and an on-base percentage of .412. Applying the modern measure of wins above replacement (WAR), Robinson's propensity to draw free passes made him one of the most valuable players in baseball during his peak years. His Offensive WAR ratings of 3.8, 3.7 and 3.6 ranked sixth in the American Association in 1886 and 1887 and eighth in 1888. =Cincinnati and Washington= In April 1891, Robinson signed to play second base for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers. By that time, Robinson had developed a reputation as a drinker, and the Sporting Life reported on the signing as follows: \\"Robby is a brilliant player, and if he will refrain from his bibulous habits he will be a great help to the club.\\" Robinson compiled a .178 batting average in 97 games for Cincinnati, but his talent for drawing walks, totaling 68 in 1891, gave him a respectable .328 on-base percentage. The Kelly's Killers disbanded in August 1891, and Robinson returned to the Browns for a single game late in the season. Robinson concluded his major league playing career with Washington Senators in 1892. He appeared in 58 games at third base for Washington and compiled a .179 batting average. According to one source, Robinson's \\"skills and health had slipped badly\\" by the 1892 season. Robinson appeared in his last major league game on August 10, 1892. =Defensive woes= While Robinson played at every position other than center field, and even pitched a few games, he spent most of his career as an infielder, playing 698 games as a second baseman, 143 as a third baseman, and 66 as a shortstop. For an infielder who posted batting averages as low as .177 in 1891, .179 in both 1882 and 1892, and .208 in 1889, the historical expectation would be the classic \\"good field, no hit\\" infielder.The notion of the Mendoza Line was not developed until the 1970s, but Robinson dropped below a .200 batting average three times and came close in 1889. At least two modern accounts support the notion that Robinson was a good fielder. In his 1999 book on the early St. Louis Browns, J. Thomas Hetrick stated: > Performing gloveless at second base, Robinson was known for his range, > accurate throwing arm, and double-play acrobatics. Ambidextrous, Robinson > sometimes startled the opposition with lefthanded throws across his chest to > nail base runners heading to third. Similarly, baseball historian Robert L. Tiemann acknowledged that Robinson's refusal to wear a glove rendered him \\"less than outstanding on ground balls\\", but praised him for his \\"good range\\" and \\"accurate throws\\" and concluded that, overall, Robinson \\"excelled at second base because of his agility and quickness.\\" While Robinson did rank second among the American Association's second basemen with 66 double plays turned in 1886, the historical record does not support the claim that he was an excellent, or even average, fielder. To the contrary, he never ranked higher than fifth in range factor, assists or putouts among the second basemen in the eight-team American Association. Moreover, he compiled a career fielding percentage of .897 and consistently ranked at or near the bottom of the American Association's second basemen in fielding percentage. He committed 103 errors in 1886, including a league- leading 95 errors at second base, and ranked among the league leaders in errors by a second baseman every year from 1886 to 1891. Perhaps most tellingly, and even though he played only nine major league seasons at second base, his 471 career errors at the position continue to rank 11th all time in major league history. Although every player has an off day, Robinson reached an all-time low in fielding on May 26, 1891, when, while playing for the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers, he had seven fielding chances and committed seven errors. Death In April 1893, less than eight months after Robinson played in his last major league game, the Sporting Life newspaper reported that a private telegram said that Robinson was dying of consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis) and had been \\"reduced to a mere skeleton, weighing in the neighborhood of ninety pounds.\\" He had reportedly signed a contract to play for Louisville in 1893, but traveled instead to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to receive treatment for his illness. Two weeks later, Sporting Life published a retraction of its account and noted: \\"The story that second baseman Yank Robinson is dying with consumption is untrue. Yank is at Hot Springs and is in good health. The tale was probably designed as a big free advertisement for Yank, and in that particular was successful. It probably however lost him a chance of an engagement by Louisville.\\" The following year, in August 1894, Robinson died from tuberculosis at the St. Louis home of friend Patsy Tebeau. He was 34 years old and left $770 to be divided between Tebeau and a brother in Cleveland. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.Retrosheet References Category:1859 births Category:1894 deaths Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Baltimore Monumentals players Category:Cincinnati Kelly's Killers players Category:Detroit Wolverines players Category:Pittsburgh Burghers players Category:St. Louis Browns (AA) players Category:Washington Senators (1891–1899) players Category:East Saginaw Grays players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia ","title":"Yank Robinson"},{"id":"12242160","text":"The gene extramachrochaetae (emc) is a Drosophila melanogaster gene that codes for the Emc protein, which has a wide variety of developmental roles. It was named, as is common for Drosophila genes, after the phenotypic change caused by a mutation in the gene (macrochaetae are the longer bristles on Drosophila).  The emc gene  The emc gene is located near the tip of the left arm of the 3rd Drosophila chromosome. It is about 4100 base pairs long, including two exons and one intron. Its FlyBase designation is Dmel_emc, and its location is at 3L:749,406..753,505 [+]. 86 alleles have been reported.  Emc interactions with other proteins  The Emc protein has a helix-loop-helix protein domain without the basic region, making it unable to bind to DNA and act as a transcription factor. It does, however, have the ability to bind other basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing proteins, such as the products of the achaete-scute complex (ac-s), to form dimers that inactivate the target protein, which is usually a transcription factor. In this way, the Emc protein can have an effect on the gene expression of many genes during Drosophila development.  Emc in neural development  The extra sensory organs (SOs) in Drosophila arise from cell-clusters known as sensory mother cells (SMCs). Once an imaginal disc cell has been selected to become an SMC, it will go on to mature into an SO. Therefore, the regulation of which imaginal disc cells become SMCs is vital to neural development. This transition is caused by the Da and AS-C genes, which are transcription factors with the basic helix-loop- helix (bHLH) domains. The Da protein (made by the daughterless gene) is a Class I HLH protein, meaning it has generalized distribution, whereas the AS-C proteins (made by the as-c gene complex) are Class II HLH proteins, meaning they have restricted distribution. The Emc protein itself is a Class V HLH protein due to its lack of the basic region and consequential inability to bind DNA. The interaction between Da or AS-C proteins with Emc to form dimers renders them inactive as transcription factors. It is the interplay between concentrations of Da, AS-C, and Emc proteins that determines whether or not a cell will become an SMC, and later on an SO. In this way, \\"Emc provides positional information for SO patterning.\\" The levels of each of these proneural proteins is likely to be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, as the lack of Notch causes an excess of neural cells while \\"constitutive Notch signaling...suppresses neural differentiation.\\" Notch has been shown to mediate lateral specification of proneural cell-clusters by restricting the expression of AS-C proteins to only the neuroblast, while causing the surrounding dermoblast cells to cease expression of the as-c complex.  Emc in sex determination  Sex in Drosophila is determined in part by the Sex lethal (Sxl) gene; more precisely, it is turned 'on' in females and 'off' in males. Whether or not this gene will be expressed is determined by the ratio of sex chromosomes (X-chromosomes) to autosomal chromosomes. The fly embryo assesses this ratio by the difference between concentrations of the scute gene product, which is on the X-chromosome, and the emc gene product, which is on an autosomal chromosome. Specifically, Emc proteins inactivate the Sc protein (a transcription factor) and stop transcription of genes on the X-chromosome. As females have twice the amount of Sc as males, they can overcome this obstacle and express the Sxl gene.  Similarity to vertebrate genes  Early support for the role of emc came from the mouse Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) gene, which negatively regulates myogenesis by forming a heterodimer with the MyoD protein and therefore inhibiting its abilities as a transcription factor. Similar processes are also likely to exist in other mammals.

History Liggins claimed to have written the tune around 1942, when playing piano in Los Angeles with a group called the California Rhythm Rascals. The tune was based around the traditional song \\"Shortnin' Bread\\". It was adopted by dancers performing a dance called the Texas Hop, and Liggins wrote words to fit the tune - \\"The honeydripper, he's a killer, the honeydripper ... he's a solid gold cat, he's the height of jive ... he's a riffer, the honeydripper.\\" The term \\"honeydripper\\" was black slang for a \\"sweet\\" guy, and had already been adopted as a nickname by blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes. Liggins tried to persuade his next bandleader, Sammy Franklin, to record it, but Franklin refused and Liggins put together his own four-man group with Little Willie Jackson (alto sax and clarinet), James Jackson Jr. (tenor sax) and a bass player. The song was heard by the owner of Exclusive Records, Leon Rene, who wanted to record it although in live shows Liggins' performance often ran to fifteen minutes. Liggins suggested cutting it down and recording it over two sides of the record, 3 minutes per side. The recording was done on April 20, 1945, with Liggins' regular bass player replaced by Red Callender and Earl Carter added on drums. The recording was an immediate smash hit. \\"It was a hit booming from every record store, shoeshine stand, barber shop and barbecued chicken shack on Los Angeles' famed Central Avenue as many thousands of G.I.s returned from the Pacific, hungry for nightlife and new civilian experiences.\\"Jim Dawson and Steve Propes, What Was The First Rock'n'Roll Record, Faber & Faber, 1992, , pp.5-8 However, the small record company could not keep up with the demand, and a cover version by Jimmie Lunceford on the larger Decca label eventually replaced it at the top of the charts. Liggins' recording has been cited as \\"the earliest runaway hit in the formative R&B; combo style\\", and as such was an important precursor to the development of rock and roll. It made #13 on the Billboard pop chart. Liggins later moved to Specialty Records and re-recorded the song in a shortened version in 1950. The original Exclusive part 1 of the song was dubbed (with another hit by Liggins on Exclusive, \\"I've Got A Right To Cry\\") and issued on 45 by Dot Records around 1956.

Lv.24), renamed No. 24 Fighter Squadron (Finnish: Hävittäjälentolaivue 24 or HLe.Lv.24 on 14 February 1944) was a fighter squadron of the Finnish Air Force during World War II. The squadron was part of Flying Regiment 2. During the Winter War, all Fokker D.XXIs - Finland's only modern fighter - were concentrated into the No. 24 Sqn, making it the only frontline fighter force. No. 24 Squadron was the most successful fighter squadron of the Finnish Air Force during World War II, claiming 877 aerial victories for a loss of 55 aircraft. The unit produced seven Mannerheim Cross winners, including Ilmari Juutilainen and Hans Wind, the two top-scoring aces. After the re-organization of the Finnish Air Force after World War II, HLeLv 24 was renamed into HLeLv 31. Today it is part of the Karelian Wing, flying F-18 Hornets and still sporting the \\"Supersonic Lynx\\" as its emblem. History Fokker D.XXI Brewster 239 Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2. =Foundation= The Finnish Air Force was re-organized on July 15, 1933. As a result of a political decision, more aircraft bases were built and new units were formed. Among these were No. 24 Sqn, which was located to Utti, north of Kotka and close to the Karelian Isthmus. No. 24 Sqn was equipped with British Gloster Gamecock III fighters, that had been license-manufactured in Finland. The first unit commander, Richard Lorenz, developed a new fighter tactic, based on aircraft pairs, instead of the three-aircraft groups that were standard of the day. It is possible that the Finnish Air Force was the first air force to introduce this system as a tactical formation, later to be immortalized by Luftwaffe, and a standard today. The squadron was equipped with Dutch Fokker D.XXI fighters in 1937. =Winter War= The unit was still equipped with Fokker D.XXIs when the Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. Violent bomb raids on Helsinki claimed more than 300 lives on the very first day of the war. The Fokker fighters were considered inferior to the Soviet equivalents, such as the Polikarpov I-16 and the Polikarpov I-153, which were the most common aircraft of the Soviet Air Force. The Finnish fighters were ordered to concentrate on the enemy's bombers in order to avoid unnecessary losses. The first victory was won on 1 December, when 11 Soviet SB bombers were downed. The first loss was attributed a blue-on-blue incident, when the Finnish anti-aircraft defences downed a fighter. Bad weather stopped air operations several times during the war, but the squadron downed 12 enemy aircraft on December 19, including two I-16 fighters. The total claimed tally for December 1939 was 54 aircraft shot down against one lost and one damaged own aircraft. These successes came at the same time as the Finnish Army stopped the Soviet advances on all fronts. Jorma Sarvanto became not only the squadron's top ace, but also overall ace of the Finnish Air Force, when he downed six Ilyushin DB-3 bombers in only four minutes. The tally for January was 34 downed aircraft for one lost in battle. The squadron operative strength was down to 28 aircraft. The Soviet fighter tactics was changed by the end of January. Drop tanks were introduced and the Soviet pilots became more aggressive. Soviet fighters could now escort bombers far inland and sometimes whole swarms of fighters (up to 40-60 fighters) could make patrols far inland. A new Soviet land offensive was set in motion on February 1, with the goal to breach the Mannerheim line on the Karelian Isthmus. No. 24 Sqn patrolled the front lines to try to protect the troops on the ground. The squadron flew sometimes as many as 88 sorties a day in February. The increased activity and work load was also noted in the losses. Among the deaths were two Danish fighter pilot volunteers. No. 24 Sqn lost six aircraft and claimed 27 enemy aircraft. The squadron strength was now down to 22 operational aircraft. During March, the weight of the ground operations was moved to the Bay of Vyborg, where the Red Army tried to cross the ice to southern Finland. The whole Finnish Air Force was ordered to try to stop the Soviet offensive. No. 24 Sqn flew 154 missions against the Soviet troop movements on the ice. A cease-fire was signed on March 13. No 24 sqn had started the war with 36 fighters and were left with 22. The unit claimed 120 aircraft downed (of which 100 were bombers). Own losses amounted to 11 aircraft, of who 9 had been lost to the enemy. Fighter aces of the No. 24 Sqn during the Winter War * Jorma Sarvanto, 13 victories * Viktor Pyötsiä, 7.5 victories * Tatu Huhanantti, 6 victories (shot down and killed on February 29, 1940) * Per-Erik Sovelius, 5.5 Victories =The Interim Peace= The squadron was re-equipped with US-made Brewster 239 fighters on April 19, 1940. This aircraft was considered to be the best fighter aircraft of the Finnish Air Force at the time. The unit itself was moved to the new base at Vesivehmaa, east of Lahti. The situation between the Soviet Union and Finland was very tense and many believed that it was only a matter of time until the war erupted again. During the 14 months that the peace lasted, the pilots of No. 24 Sqn trained hard, so that they would be ready to take on the enemy again. A ground-based early- warning system was developed and introduced to give warning of enemy aircraft at an earlier stage. =The Continuation War= 1941 At the beginning of the war, the squadron was equipped with 34 Brewster fighters. The Finnish Air Force consisted of 235 aircraft, of whom 187 were immediately ready. 179 of these were fighters. Against them were 1,332 aircraft from the Leningrad Military Area, 400 aircraft from the Soviet Baltic Red Fleet and 114 aircraft from the Soviet Arctic Red Fleet. The Finnish aircraft were marked with a yellow band, similar to German aircraft, to more easily distinguish them from the opponents' aircraft. About 150 Soviet aircraft attacked several Finnish cities on June 25, 1941. This started the Continuation War. During the first day, No 24 Sqn downed 10 enemy bombers, without own losses. The unit protected southern Finland between June 25–30 and managed to shoot down 17 enemy aircraft, among these were two MBR-2 amphibious aircraft and one PE-1. One Brewster was lost in an accident. The squadron was relocated to Rantasalmi AFB on July 3. Their mission was to support the Karelian Army's operations, together with the entire 2nd Air Regiment, the reconnaissance squadrons 12 and 16, as well as Bristol Blenheim bombers from the 4th Air Regiment. Soviet reconnaissance discovered the Finnish troop concentrations and began a series of attacks on these on July 8. The No 24 Sqn downed 11 enemy aircraft without own losses. The unit continued with its support operations during the summer of 1941. By the end of 1941, the No 24 Sqn could claim 135 victories against and only two losses to the enemy (one to enemy anti-aircraft fire and one in an accident). The Finnish Air Force total tally was 356 enemy aircraft downed and 84 lost in battle and in accidents. No 24 Sqn was now the most successful fighter unit of the Finnish Air Force. 1942 After the Finnish Army had reached its operational goals by the end of December 1941, the war changed. It now took more a form of trench warfare. At the same time, the Soviet Air Force was being re-equipped with new fighters, many coming as lend-lease from the United Kingdom. Fighters such as Hawker Hurricane IIA and IIB began appearing over the Finnish front. No. 14 Sqn, which was equipped with Fokker D.XXIs, and who was located in northern Karelia faced increasing difficulties against the more modern Soviet fighters. The second group of the 24th Sqn was ordered to reinforce the defence at Tiksjärvi. Here they met Soviet MiG-3s and Hurricanes and also suffered their first losses to Soviet fighters (three Brewsters were shot down), but they also shot down at least eight enemy aircraft. The Battle of Hogland was fought late in the winter of 1942. No 24 Sqn supported the operations with six fighters. The fighter ace Ilmari Juutilainen managed to down two enemy aircraft. Juutilainen had now 20 victories and was rewarded with the Mannerheim Cross, the first pilot to be given the distinction in the unit. The Finns conquered the island after a successful operation. During the remainder of the year, the unit provided air defence from the Gulf of Finland up to northern Karelia. Jorma Karhunen was awarded with the Mannerheim Cross on September 8. The Soviet Air Force operated now better fighters, such as the LaGG-3, La-5, Il-2 Sturmovik, Yak-1, and Yak-7. 1943 In the beginning of 1943, the unit was down to 24 operational Brewster fighters. At the same time, a new unit was formed. No. 34 Sqn was formed to incorporate the new Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. It also recruited the best pilots from other units, among them many of No. 24 Sqn's best pilots, i.e. Ilmari Juutilainen and Jorma Lukkanen, who had 34 and 14.5 victories respectively. The Soviet Air Force was continuously modernized. The No. 24 Sqn participated among other in the defence of the Gulf of Finland, where they met the aircraft of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, who recently had mounted an offensive. Captain Hans Wind received the Mannerheim Cross on July 31, when he reached 31 victories. 1944 In early 1944 the unit received the \\"fighter\\" prefix to its name and only 17 Brewsters remained operational. The successful aircraft, with a 30:1 victory ratio was replaced with Bf 109s. The unit was fully re-equipped by May 1944 and operated 14 Bf 109Gs when the Soviet Great Offensive started. The Soviet Great Offensive The Soviet land, air and naval forces launched a coordinated attack on Finland on June 9, 1944. More than 1,500 Soviet aircraft were concentrated against the Finns in the immediate area. The Soviet strategic bomber command, ADD, also supported the operations. The Finnish Air Force could muster 16 Bf 109s in No. 34 Sqn, 18 Brewsters in No. 26 Sqn and 14 Bf 109s in the No. 24 Sqn. The No. 24 Sqn was based at Suulajärvi on the Southern Karelian Isthmus. The No.24 Sqn was first tasked with reconnaissance, trying to find out how far the Soviet forces had advanced into Finnish territory. The largest activity in the air was on June 14, 1944, during the battles of Siiranmäki and Kuuterselkä. The enemy gathered some 1,700 aircraft for the battle. On June 15, the No 24 Sqn was moved further northwest, to the airport at Lappeenranta. The unit was hardly struck on June 17, when lieutenant Nissinen (32.5 victories) and lieutenant Sarjamo (12.5 victories), two of its most experienced pilots were killed in action. Finland began receiving well-needed help from Germany - new Messerschmitt fighters arrived to replace losses and the German jabo unit Geschwader Kuhlmey also arrived and gave valuable assistance. =Results of the war= No. 24 Sqn had 763 confirmed kills and lost itself 30 aircraft (of whom 26 to enemy fighters). This gives a kill-ratio of 29.3 downed enemy aircraft for every own aircraft lost. Four pilots of No. 24 Sqn were awarded with the Mannerheim Cross, two of them received it twice. The unit was renamed into No. 31 Fighter Sqn on December 4, 1944. The unit is still active and flies F-18s today. =Unit commanders= *Major Richard Lorenz, July 15, 1933 - November 21, 1938 *LtCol Gustav Erik Magnusson, November 21, 1938 - December 4, 1944 *Major Jorma Karhunen, December 4, 1944 Organization =Winter War= *1st Flight (1.

The ship was one of the first battleships built by the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) as part of a program of naval expansion under Kaiser Wilhelm II. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was built in Kiel at the Germaniawerft shipyard. She was laid down in January 1898, launched in June 1899, and completed in May 1901. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse served in the main fleet—the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet) and later the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet)—for the first seven years of her career. She participated in several of the fleet's training cruises and maneuvers, primarily in the North and Baltic Seas. Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents. She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908–10, after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four sister ships, all of which were essentially obsolete by that time. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and deployed to coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was used as a depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrap to a German company and broken up in 1920. Design Line-drawing of the Kaiser Friedrich III class After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) ordered the four pre-dreadnought battleships in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Leo von Caprivi, became the Chancellor of Germany in 1890, and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann became the new Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt. Hollmann requested the first pre-dreadnought battleship in 1892, but the Franco-Russian Alliance, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's Baltic Sea coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 budget year, and now the Reichstag approved the new ship; a second member of the class followed in early 1896, and the third ship, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, was authorized for the following year's budget. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines that drove three screw propellers. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosses powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men. The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns in twin turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure on the centerline. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns and twelve 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. She also carried twelve machine cannon. Six torpedo tubes were mounted in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's belt armor was thick, and the main armor deck was thick. The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with of armor, and the secondary casemates received of protection. Service history =Construction and early service= Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse at her launching Kaiser Wilhelm II, the emperor of Germany, believed a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe. He initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg-class ships. These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III-class battleships, of which Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was the third. Her keel was laid on 22 January 1898 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, as construction number 22. She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz König Wilhelm, to replace the obsolete armored frigate . Her scheduled launching on 29 April 1899 was delayed to 1June after a large fire at the shipyard damaged the slipway. Louise, the Grand Duchess of Baden, christened the ship after her father Wilhelm I of Germany, the ship's namesake. Wilhelm II gave the launching speech for the ship commemorating his grandfather. After completing fitting-out work, dockyard sea trials began on 19 February 1901, followed by acceptance trials beginning 18 March. These were completed by May, and she was formally commissioned on 5May. That year, Erich Raeder—who went on to command the Kriegsmarine in World War II—was promoted to serve as a watch officer aboard her. After commissioning in 1901, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse joined her sister ships in I Squadron of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet). After her sister ran aground and had to be docked for repairs, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse replaced her as the I Squadron flagship, which was commanded by Prince Heinrich, the brother of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when Kaiser Friedrich III returned to service. In the meantime, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was present for the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June and the dedication of a monument at the Marineakademie (Naval Academy) in Kiel. At the end of July, she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters, and while docked in Cádiz, they rendezvoused with the Brandenburg-class battleships returning from East Asian waters. I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, though the late arrival of the Brandenburgs delayed the participation of I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training. The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight, followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower Elbe. Gunnery drills took place in Kiel Bay before the fleet steamed to Danzig Bay, where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December, which included a stop at Oslo from 7to 12 December. Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 On 13 December, the new pre-dreadnought battleship ran aground off Korsør; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse took her under tow back to port. I Squadron went on a short cruise in the western Baltic Sea, then embarked on a major cruise around the British Isles, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. The annual fleet maneuvers began in August in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade Bight. During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was assigned to the \\"hostile\\" force, as were several of her sister ships. The \\"hostile\\" force was first tasked with preventing the \\"German\\" squadron from passing through the Great Belt into the Baltic. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River, where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized. The \\"hostile\\" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December. In 1903, the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of battleships, was reorganized as the \\"Active Battle Fleet\\". Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse remained in I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest s, while the older Brandenburg-class ships were placed in reserve to be rebuilt. The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain from 7May to 10 June. In July, I Squadron went on its annual cruise to Norway. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The winter cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak on 1December. =1904–1914= I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January. Further squadron exercises followed from 8to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May, and in July I Squadron and I Scouting Group visited Britain, stopping at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. The fleet then began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3September, where it took part in a major amphibious landing exercise, after which the ships took the ground troops from IX Corps that participated in the exercise to Altona for a parade reviewed by Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing exercises with IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2December. The German battle fleet at sea; a leads the line. The ships of I Squadron went on a pair of training cruises during 9–19 January and 27 February16 March 1905. Individual ship and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9August; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6to 13 September, and consisted of only exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During the exercises, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to I Division of II Squadron. In early December, I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises. Over the winter of 1906–1907, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse underwent a major overhaul in Kiel, which was completed by the end of April. By this time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. As a result, the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet). Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3to 9September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8September and lasted five more days. A shorter period of dockyard work took place from 7December to 27 January 1908. She returned to the fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after the conclusion of the autumn maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910. During the refit, four of the ship's 15 cm guns and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were removed. Two 8.8 cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8.8 cm battery was modified. Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and the ship's funnels were lengthened. After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there for the rest of her peacetime career. =World War I= As a result of the outbreak of World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as V Battle Squadron on 5August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, but they served in this capacity for only a very short time. In mid-September, V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault against the Russians at Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic. Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse first went to Hamburg, where her crew was reduced on 5March. She was moved to Kiel on 30 April, where the rest of her crew were removed. She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship. The following year, the ship was used as a torpedo target ship. The Armistice at Compiègne ended the fighting in November 1918; according to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles (which formally ended the war) Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the \\"Deutschland or types\\". On 6December 1919, the vessel was struck from the naval list and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Berlin. The following year, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was broken up for scrap metal in Kiel- Nordmole.

It is the furthest northeast neighborhood within Minneapolis. The neighborhood is within Minneapolis's first ward and falls under the jurisdiction of the second precinct of the Minneapolis Police Department.  History  Waite Park was among the last areas of northeast Minneapolis to be developed into urban neighborhoods in the last part of the nineteenth century. The area was mostly farmland until the 1880s and 1890s. The completion of Saint Anthony Parkway through the neighborhood in 1924 increased the pace of development. Although many of the homes in the neighborhood were built in the decades between the completion of the parkway and World War II, the neighborhood was not fully developed until the postwar housing boom. The neighborhood is named after Edward Foote Waite, a former judge in Hennepin County. Waite Park Neighborhood and Columbia Park Neighborhood were the last areas of East Minneapolis to be developed. The land between 27th Avenue and 37th Avenue was incorporated into the city by 1887. Most farmers in the area sold their land to developers soon afterwards. Their former fields were platted into house lots and streets. By 1892 one-third of the land in Waite Park had been platted. Some farmers continued to hold against the advancing city, the last being the Ritchels who remained until the 1940s. The Minneapolis St Paul and Sault Ste Marie Railway, which still runs through the neighborhood, was also completed in 1887. The railroad built a large repair facility on the shores of Lake Sandy. The lake disappeared in the early twentieth century, but the Shoreham Yards facility remains. New Boston, centered at Lowry and Central was a thriving commercial center at this time. Despite railroad access and proximity to a commercial center, Waite Park grew slowly in these years. 30 years after incorporation, two-thirds of the land had been platted for houses, but only 160 built. Although the total population of Minneapolis 80 years ago was almost the same as it is today Waite Park had less than 7% of the 2400 homes in the neighborhood today. Central Avenue was the focus of the area; two-thirds of the houses in Waite Park in 1914 were within 3 blocks. In May 1915, the St. Anthony Commercial Club proposed to build a parkway across Northeast Minneapolis. This would help to complete the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway, a belt of parks and parkways encircling the city, first envisioned in the 1880s. They also hoped it would stimulate economic development in the area. This idea received a boost when the Armour company donated a mile-and-a-half-long strip of land in St. Anthony township, and offered to pay the costs of constructing a parkway along that route. Armour had purchased the land for a meatpacking plant, later they decided South Saint Paul would be a better location. The original plan for extending the Grand Rounds was to extend Stinson Boulevard into what is now Columbia Heights, and follow the Reservoir Boulevard back to Columbia Park (which had been purchased in 1892). Now the plan was to build St. Anthony Boulevard along a meandering path across Northeast Minneapolis. The new parkway was named 'St. Anthony' because it ran through St. Anthony Township for much of its length. Land was also donated to extend the parkway to East Hennepin Avenue, along what is now Industrial Boulevard. In the 1930s this southern extension of the parkway would be swapped for Ridgeway Road to provide room for a gravel pit. The stretch between the end of Ridgeway Road and the Mississippi river trails that start at the University of Minnesota East Bank remain the only gap in the Grand Rounds. To build St Anthony Parkway the city had to purchase the land between Stinson and Columbia Park, which was mostly empty lots. However, as the Secretary of the Park Board admitted at the time \\"No time has been set for beginning the actual work of constructing the boulevard nor is any money for the work now available.\\" The outbreak of World War I further delayed construction, which isn't completed until 1924. The total cost of the boulevard was estimated at $910,000 in 1923. This money came from a variety of sources. Armour's donation of land and materials was valued at $160,000. $300,000 was raised in bonds, and $150,000 from general city funds. The remaining $300,000 was assessed against property in East Minneapolis, which worked out to about $15 per lot. In November 1923 Armour offered to build a golf course on their land east of the parkway, and sell it to the city for $200,000. Greens fees would pay for the acquisition so it was a good deal for the city. In 1924 another $50,000 in bonds was issued to complete St. Anthony Boulevard and Grandview Park (renamed to Deming Heights Park in the 1930s). In September 1924 early settlers of the area celebrated the grand opening of the Boulevard with a parade, and speeches. Businesses in the area were closed for half a day so everyone could attend the festivities. Also in 1924 the Johnson Streetcar line was extended from 29th to 33rd, which improved access and spurred house construction in Waite Park. In October 1924 Alderman Gisele was quoted in the local paper, \\"The corner of 33rd and Ulysses is in a section which is coming to the front as a very desirable locality for modern homes. It is not very far from the beautiful new St. Anthony Boulevard.\\" By 1940 three- quarters of all houses in Waite Park were within three blocks of St. Anthony Boulevard. The number of houses had increased fourfold in 25 years, but there were still only a quarter of the present number of houses. It would take the post-WWII housing boom to completely fill out the neighborhood. Contrast this with the Audubon Park Neighborhood, just south of St. Anthony Boulevard, where three-quarters of existing houses were built before 1939.  Notable features  Saint Anthony Parkway runs along the southern border of the Waite Park neighborhood and is part of the Minneapolis Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. Parks in the neighborhood include Waite Park, Deming Heights Park, and Cavell Park.

The property was settled by the Ashbridge family, who were English Quakers who left Pennsylvania after the American Revolutionary War. In 1796, as United Empire Loyalists, the family were granted of land on Lake Ontario east of the Don River, land which they had begun clearing two years earlier. The family constructed log cabins and frame homes on the shore of a bay, which was later named for them. The present home was built starting in 1854, with additions in 1900 and 1920. As the city of Toronto grew and encroached on the estate, the family gradually sold off their land, leaving only the current property by the 1920s. The estate is located on Queen Street East near Greenwood Avenue in the Leslieville neighbourhood. In 1972, the family donated the estate to the Ontario Heritage Trust, although members of the family continued living in the home until 1997. The site was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2008. The Ashbridges are the only family in the history of Toronto to have continuously occupied land that they settled for more than 200 years. History One of the 1811 frame houses The Ashbridge family were English Quakers who lived in Chester County, Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century. Jonathan Ashbridge had been disowned by the Chester Meeting some time after the American Revolutionary War and died in Pennsylvania in 1782. Jonathan's wife, Sarah, arrived in Upper Canada in 1793 with her two sons, John and Jonathan, three of her daughters, and their families. Folklore suggests they spent their first winter in the ruins of the old French fort, Fort Rouillé, near present-day Fort York. In 1794, the family began clearing land east of present-day Greenwood Avenue on three plots laid out by John Graves Simcoe, on a country trail which became the Kingston Road. As United Empire Loyalists fleeing political persecution in the United States, the family were officially granted of the land in 1796, known as Part Lots 7, 8, and 9, stretching from Lake Ontario to present-day Danforth Avenue. A log cabin was built on the trail about from the shoreline of Lake Ontario, on a bay formed by the mouth of the Don River. While clearing the land for farming, the family subsisted on fish and waterfowl from the bay and pigs that they raised. The family grew wheat as soon as they were able, which they transported to market. In the winter they sold ice cut from the bay. Sarah Ashbridge died in 1801. The brothers, John and Jonathan, each married in 1809, and began construction on two-storey frame homes for their families the same year. These houses were completed in 1811, and located west of the present estate. John and Jonathan served as pathmasters of the Kingston Road from 1797 to 1817. Both participated in the War of 1812 and the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. Jonathan's son, Jesse, inherited Part Lot 9 upon his father's death in 1845. =Jesse Ashbridge house= Jesse Ashbridge house, photographed by Elizabeth Ashbridge prior to its 1899 addition The house known as the Jesse Ashbridge house was built on the family's land beginning in 1854. The house was designed for Sarah's grandson and Jonathan's son, Jesse Ashbridge, by prominent local architect, Joseph Sheard, who many years later would later serve as Mayor of Toronto. The cottage was designed in the Regency style, built with red brick laid in a Flemish bond, with a hipped roof and treillage veranda. Jesse married in 1864 and died in 1874. As Toronto's suburbs began to encroach on the family's property in the late-1800s, Jesse's wife, Elizabeth, began subdividing the lot in 1893. A second storey in Second Empire style was added to the home in 1900, with a mansard roof, while maintaining the original veranda. The house was built to the east of the old frame home, which was demolished in 1913. Elizabeth continued to live in the home until her death in 1918. A further addition was designed in 1920 by Elizabeth's son, Wellington, who trained as a civil engineer. This was in the form of a two-storey addition to the house's north wall. =20th century= Map of Toronto Harbour and Ashbridge's Bay in 1906 In the late nineteenth century, waste from livestock operations at the Gooderham and Worts distillery led to increasing pollution in the bay. A cholera outbreak in 1892 led the distillery to implement an improved waste filtration system, under threat of legal action from the City. Engineer E. H. Keating devised a plan to alter the course of the Don River which improved conditions in the river, but the bay remained severely polluted. Starting in 1912, the Toronto Harbour Commission began the Ashbridge's Bay Reclamation Scheme, the largest infrastructure project in North America up to that time. The bay was drained, and dredging from the Toronto Harbour was used to fill an area from the harbour to the bay, creating the Toronto Port Lands. Only a small portion of the original bay remained, and the home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water. As the city of Toronto expanded eastward and encroached on the estate, Elizabeth and Wellington Ashbridge subdivided and sold off much of the family's land for residential subdivisions. The Duke of Connaught Public School (1912) and S.H. Armstrong Community Recreation Centre were built on land that had been the Ashbridges' orchard. Woodfield Road, on the east side of the current property, was originally the farm lane going to the fields farther north. By the 1920s, the property owned by the family had shrunk to the that now make up the estate. Wellington's daughters, Dorothy Bullen and Elizabeth Burdon, donated the house and remaining property to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1972, along with a collection of family artifacts. Dorothy, Sarah Ashbridge's great-great-granddaughter, continued living in the house until 1997. The six generations of the Ashbridge family are the only family in the history of Toronto to have retained the same property for more than 200 years. =Present day= A number of localities in the area are named after the Ashbridges. Just to the south of the house is Jonathan Ashbridge Park (named after Sarah's son), while slightly to the east is Sarah Ashbridge Avenue. The bay that marked the southern edge of the property is now known as Ashbridge's Bay, named for John Ashbridge. On the east and north sides of the bay is the large Ashbridge's Bay Park. Ashbridge's Bay Park North, to the north of the bay, is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009. The west side of the bay is the location of the Ashbridge's Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, Toronto's main sewage treatment plant and the second largest such facility in Canada. A large willow tree on the estate, planted in 1919 and a well-known feature of the Leslieville neighbourhood, was felled by high winds in 2016.  Historic plaque  Ashbridge Estate historic plaque The Ontario Heritage Trust plaque on the estate reads: \\"This property was home to one family for two centuries. Sarah Ashbridge and her family moved here from Pennsylvania and began clearing land in 1794. Two years later they were granted 600 acres (243 hectares) between Ashbridge's Bay and present day Danforth Avenue. The Ashbridges prospered as farmers until Toronto suburbs began surrounding their land in the 1880s. They sold all but this part of their original farm by the 1920s. Donated to the Ontario Heritage Foundation in 1972, it was the family estate until 1997. As they changed from pioneers to farmers to professionals over 200 years on this property, the Ashbridges personified Ontario's development from agricultural frontier to urban industrial society.\\" See also * List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto * Ontario Heritage Trust * City of Toronto Heritage Property Inventory References Further reading  * Category:Houses in Toronto Category:City of Toronto Heritage Properties Category:Ontario Heritage Trust Category:1796 establishments in Canada ","title":"Ashbridge Estate"},{"id":"12242230","text":"Balik may refer to: * Balik (name) * Balik (ruler) (died 1347), Bulgarian Toponyms: * Balik, Azerbaijan * Balik, Iran * Balık, lake in Turkey  See also  * Balyk (disambiguation) ","title":"Balik"},{"id":"12242232","text":"Giorgia Fumanti (born February 22, 1975) is an Italian soprano singer of operatic pop and crossover music based in Montreal, Canada since 2002.

Description and characteristics  It is a quite small cowry, up to , irregular and flattened, with very calloused edges and roughly subhexagonal. The color is pale (from white to dirty beige), but the dorsum seems transparent, often greenish grey with yellowish margins, with sometimes darker transverse stripes and a delicate yellow ring. The opening is wide and white, with pronounced denticules. The mantle of the live animal is mottled with black and off-white. The shell of Monetaria moneta varies widely in shape and color, with some of these varieties having been described as full species. As a result, this species has numerous taxonomic synonyms.

It is also reportedly naturalized in Florida, Puerto Rico, Bermuda and the Leeward Islands. The plants are found from sea level to 3000 m, in rain forest clearings, monsoonal forests and rocky mountainsides. Description left Phoenix reclinata is a dioecious clumping palm, producing multiple stems from 7.5 to 15 m in height and 30 cm in width. Foliage is pinnate and recurved, growing 2.5 to 4.5 m in length and 0.75 m in width. Leaf color is bright to deep green on 30 cm petioles with long, sharp spines at the base, with 20 to 40 leaves per crown. The plants are unisexual and florets appear at the top of the palm stem. Male florets are a dirty, pale yellow and fall off after blooming; females are small, globose and yellow-green.Roodt, Veronica (1992).

Gaborone, Botswana: Shell Oil Botswana This species grows edible, oblong fruit, orange in color (when ripe), at 2.5 cm in diameter. The fruit are borne in large, pendant clusters and contain one seed each. Palms across the genus Phoenix readily hybridize with one another resulting in naturally occurring variations. They usually tolerate salt-spray, and moderate drought where the water table is permanently high. Uses Ripening fruit on P. reclinata In addition to the fruit, which attracts animals as well as humans, the palm heart can be eaten as a vegetable. In KwaZulu-Natal, and the Okavango Delta, Botswana, the sap is tapped shortly before flowering to make palm wine. The fibres of young, unopened leaves can be used to make carpets, kilts and brooms. The roots contain tannin and can be used to make a brown dye. They also produce an edible gum. The wood is lightweight and not particularly useful.

Skvortsov-Stepanov was one of the oldest participants in the Russian revolutionary movement and a Marxist writer. Ivan was the son of a Moscow factory clerical worker based in Bogorodsk.  Early career  He graduated from the Moscow Teachers' Institute in 1890, became an elementary school teacher, joined the revolutionary movement as a student in Moscow in 1892, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1896. He was arrested, and exiled to Tula district, where he met other exiles, including Alexander Bogdanov and Vladimir Bazarov. Together they joined the Bolsheviks after their release in the winter of 1904. When Bor'ba was published in November 1905, Skvortsov-Stepanov was a member of the editorial board. In 1906 he was a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the RSDLP, where he supported Lenin. During the period 1907–10, he favoured the Mezhraiontsy faction, but later fell again under the influence of Lenin. In 1907-09, he, Bazarov and Bogdanov produced what became the standard Russian translation of Das Kapital, by Karl Marx. In 1911, he launched the Bolshevik newspaper Mysl, but was arrested very soon afterwards. He was repeatedly arrested and exiled for his revolutionary activities. Following the Revolution of 1917 he became the People's Commissar for Finance of the RSFSR, until February 1918, when the Bolsheviks briefly formed a coalition government with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. He joined the Left Communists, who opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany. He worked on Pravda in 1918-1925. In 1919, he was appointed head of Gosizdat, the State Publishing House. During the war with Poland, in 1920, he was appointed a member of the short-lived Polish provisional government.  Conflict with Mayakovsky  In September 1921, Skvortsov-Stepanov became embroiled in a dispute with the young Futurist poet, Vladimir Mayakovsky. Like most leading Bolsheviks, he was unable to see any value in Mayakovsky's work, although the poet was an active supporter of the Bolsheviks, who had been imprisoned under the old regime. When Skvortsov- Stepanov learned that the script of Mayakovsky's play, Mystery Bouffe had been published in full in a magazine called Theatre Herald, he banned its editors from paying the author's commission. Mayakovsky appealed to the Moscow Trade Union Council, who ordered that his fee should be paid, and suspended the union memberships of Skvortsov-Stepanov and two other Gosizdat officials for three months. The decision outraged a senior contributor to Pravda, Lev Sosnovsky, who called for a ban on Mayakovsky's entire works. This threat was not carried out, and a few months later, Lenin publicly praised Mayakovsky's poetry for its political insight.  Later career  Skvortsov-Stepanov was appointed chief editor of Izvestia in June 1925, having supported the triumvirate of Josif Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev against Leon Trotsky. When the split within the triumvirate came to a head at the congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in December 1926, he backed Stalin, was elected to the CPSU Central Committee, and when the committee met, on 28 December 1925, they decided by a majority to appoint him editor of Leningradskaya Pravda, in place of one of Zinoviev's supporters, despite objections from Zinoviev, Trotsky and others that editors of local newspaper should be appointed locally. When he arrived at the newspaper's office to impose a pro-Stalin political line, delegates from several Leningrad party organisations came to threaten him with violence, and members of staff walked out in protest denouncing those who stayed behind as spies, but the first pro- Stalin issue came out on 30 December. Skvortsov-Stepanov remained in Leningrad for only a short period, before returning to his old job in Moscow. Upon his death from typhoid in October 1928, Stalin commemorated him as a \\"staunch and steadfast Leninist\\".http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1928/10/x01.htm  Personality  The writer Maxim Gorky described Skvortsov as \\"a short man with a greyish compexion, his light blue eyes smiled, however, the triumphant smile of the lucky man who has a truth inaccessible to others...He eschewed all books except Das Kapital - he made a boast of that.\\" Publications * Izbrannye ateisticheskie proizvedenii'a References External links * Letter from Lenin to Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, 2 December 1909 Category:1870 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Pushkinsky District, Moscow Oblast Category:People from Moscow Governorate Category:Russian Social Democratic Labour Party members Category:Old Bolsheviks Category:Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Russian Constituent Assembly members Category:Russian communists Category:Bolshevik finance Category:Burials at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis Category:Pravda people ","title":"Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov"},{"id":"12242297","text":"KXLE may refer to: * KXLE (AM), a radio station (1240 AM) licensed to Ellensburg, Washington, United States * KXLE-FM, a radio station (95.3 FM) licensed to Ellensburg, Washington, United States ","title":"KXLE"},{"id":"12242305","text":"Dick Rowland or Roland (aka \\"Diamond Dick Rowland\\", born c. 1902- ?) was an African-American teenage shoeshiner whose arrest for assault in May 1921 was the impetus for the Tulsa Race Massacre. Rowland was 19 years old at the time. The alleged victim of the assault was a white, 17-year-old, elevator operator Sarah Page. She had declined to prosecute. According to conflicting reports, the arrest was prompted after Rowland tripped in Page's elevator on his way to a segregated bathroom, and a white store clerk reported the incident as an \\"assault\\" or a rape. Early life Rowland's birth name was \\"Jimmie Jones\\". It is not known where he was born, but by 1908 he and two sisters were orphans living in Vinita, Oklahoma. Jones was informally adopted by Damie Ford, an African-American woman. In approximately 1909 Ford and Jones moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to join Ford's family, the Rolands. Eventually, Jones took Roland as his last name, which was later reported as \\"Rowland.\\" He selected his favorite first name, Dick, as his own. Rowland attended the city's segregated schools, including Booker T. Washington High School. He dropped out of high school to take a job shining shoes in a white-owned and white-patronized shine parlor on Main Street in downtown Tulsa. As Tulsa was a segregated city where Jim Crow practices were in effect, black people were not allowed to use toilet facilities used by white people. There was no separate facility for blacks at the shine parlor where Rowland worked and the owner had arranged for black employees to use a segregated \\"Colored\\" restroom on the top floor of the nearby Drexel Building at 319 S. Main Street. Arrest and violent disturbances On May 30, 1921, Rowland attempted to enter the Drexel building elevator. Although the exact facts are in dispute, according to the most accepted accounts, he tripped and, trying to save himself from falling, grabbed the first thing he could, which happened to be the arm of the elevator operator, Sarah Page. Startled, the elevator operator screamed, and a white clerk in a first-floor store called police to report seeing Rowland flee from the elevator. The white clerk on the first floor reported the incident as an attempted assault. Rowland was arrested the following day, on May 31, 1921. With the headline \\"Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator\\" that day's issue of the Tulsa Tribune newspaper claimed Rowland had attacked Page and had torn her clothes. A subsequent gathering of angry local whites outside the courthouse where Rowland was being held, and the spread of rumors he had been lynched, alarmed the local black population, some of whom arrived at the courthouse armed. Shots were fired, and twelve people were killed; ten white and two black. In retaliation, a riot by whites was sparked that lasted 16 hours, during which time a white mob started fires and airplanes allegedly dropped firebombs. The destruction included 35 city blocks burned down and 1,256 residences in Tulsa's prosperous African American neighborhood of Greenwood destroyed, resulting in over 800 injuries and 37 confirmed dead – 25 black and 12 white. Later accounts have suggested the number of deaths were under-recorded, and the actual death toll was at least 150. The case against Dick Rowland was dismissed at the end of September 1921. The dismissal followed the receipt of a letter by the County Attorney from Sarah Page, in which she stated that she did not wish to prosecute the case. Subsequent developments According to Damie Ford, once Rowland was exonerated he immediately left Tulsa, and went to Kansas City. Little else is publicly known about the remainder of his life. Dick Rowland is remembered in an opera about the Tulsa race massacre composed in 2004 by Lindsay Davidson.

Background Until the death of Duke Mestwin II in 1294, the Duchy of Pomerelia on the Baltic coast, stretching from the border with the Imperial Duchy of Pomerania in the west to the Prussian territory of the Order state at the Vistula river in the east, had been held by the Samborides dynasty, liensmen of the Polish Piast rulers. Przemysł II, King of Poland since 1295, incorporated Pomerelia () into the Lands of the Polish Crown, against the protest of the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg referring to the Treaty of Arnswalde signed with Duke Mestwin in 1269. The next year, the Ascanian margraves instigated the kidnapping and killing of King Przemysł, probably backed by King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who aimed for the Polish crown. King Wenceslaus II prevailed against his Piast rival Władysław I the Elbow-high and was crowned King of Poland in 1300. He ruled in Pomerelia with the assistance of the local Swenzones noble family. Upon the assassination of his son Wenceslaus III in 1306, the Přemyslid dynasty became extinct and Duke Władysław was able to occupy the Pomerelian lands. The Swenzones, fearing for their assets and sinecures, called for Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg, whose troops occupied the territory up to the city of Gdańsk. Władysław reacted by calling the forces of the Teutonic Order, who under the command of Heinrich von Plötzke in 1308 re-conquered Gdańsk and most of Pomerelia. However, after the Teutonic takeover they denied the handover to Władysław, as the duke refused to pay the requested expense allowance. Instead they concluded the 1309 Treaty of Soldin with Margrave Waldemar, whose resistance from the beginning had been relatively weak and who now was willing to sell off his claims to Pomerelia. The battles King Ladislaus the Elbow-high breaking off agreements with the Teutonic Knights at Brześć Kujawski, a painting by Jan Matejko in the National Museum in Warsaw Władysław, chafing under his defeat, unsuccessfully sued the Teutonic Order at the Roman Curia. However, he was crowned Polish king in 1320 and forged new alliances with the Kingdom of Hungary and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, when he married his daughter Elisabeth to King Charles I in 1320 and his son Casimir to Aldona of Lithuania, daughter of Grand Duke Gediminas. On the other hand, the Kingdom of Bohemia, since 1310 under the rule of the mighty House of Luxembourg, rose again and King John the Blind himself claimed the Polish crown as a heritage from the Přemyslids. The Teutonic Knights supported King John, who joined them in crusades against the pagan Lithuanians, and furthermore were allied with Władysław's enemy in Masovia, Duke Wenceslaus of Płock. In 1326 the forces of King Władysław with Lithuanian support devastated the Neumark region and the next year turned against the Teutonic Order, while in the south King John the Blind marched against Kraków. Though he was urged by King Charles I of Hungary to retreat, he vassalized many of the Duchies of Silesia. Taking advantage of the weakness of Poland due to the internal fragmentation, the Teutonic knights pillaged and conquered the Polish Kuyavian region and the Dobrzyń Land. King Władysław received help from Lithuania and Hungary and in turn pillaged the Kulmerland of Teutonic Prussia up to the Osa River near Grudziądz. The Teutonic Knights counterattacked, taking many towns in Kuyavia and Dobrzyń. A Polish and Lithuanian counterattack in 1330 resulted in a temporary peace, with the Order returning part of its military gains to Poland, but over the next year, the fighting continued. After the indecisive Battle of Płowce in 1331, the Order gained the upper hand and retook Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land. Both sides agreed on an armistice, while King Władysław died in 1333. Aftermath In 1343, the territorial claims of the parties were settled in the Peace of Kalisz signed by Władysław's son King Casimir III, formally ending the war. He thereby regained Kuyavia and Dobrzyń, but finally lost Pomerelia. Nevertheless, he retained the title of a Pomeraniæ dominus et heres (\\"Lord and Heir of Pomerania\\"). The Pomerelian lands and the Polish access to the Baltic Sea remained a matter of conflict: regained as the Polish fief of Royal Prussia after the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the course of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, and part of the \\"Polish Corridor\\" created by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the ongoing dispute over the region for centuries put a strain on German–Polish relations.

Mendenhall (born April 14, 1951) is a convicted American murderer and accused serial killer. He was arrested in Tennessee in July 2007 - and found guilty in 2010 - for the June 26, 2007 murder of Sara Hulbert. The body was found by the security guard on duty that night. A long haul trucker, his truck was found to contain the blood of numerous other murdered or missing women. He has been charged with the murders of three other women at truck stops in Alabama, Indiana and Tennessee. He is still under investigation for murders in Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Biography Mendenhall grew up in Crawford County, Illinois. He was married with two daughters. Arrest A resident of Albion, Illinois, Mendenhall was arrested at the TA truck stop on Interstate 24 in Nashville, Tennessee on July 12, 2007 after Detective Sgt. Pat Postiglione spotted a truck that matched surveillance footage from the night Sara Nicole Hulbert was murdered at the same truck stop. Upon inspection of the vehicle, a large quantity of bloody clothing and identification and personal effects of an Indianapolis woman, who went missing the day before, was found in a plastic sack along with blood spots scattered around the inside of his cab to include the steering wheel and even on his hands when arrested and Mendenhall was taken into custody. Police catalogued 300 items from the truck including a rifle, knives, handcuffs, latex gloves, several weapons cartridges, black tape, a nightstick, and sex toys. Sampling of these items turned up the DNA of five different women. On August 2, 2007, Mendenhall waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Victims Mendenhall's victims were primarily young prostitutes, usually found shot, though detectives have determined that his method of killing may have changed over the years. During questioning, he implicated himself in the shooting death of Hulbert, whose body was found on June 26, 2007. He has also implicated himself in the shooting death of Symantha Winters, whose body was found June 6, 2007 in a trash can at a truck stop in Lebanon, Tennessee. She had a criminal record showing at least one previous charge of prostitution. On August 17, 2007, a Wilson County grand jury indicted Mendenhall for the murder of Winters. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life. Another victim killed on July 11, 2007 at a Flying J truck stop on Interstate 465 in Indianapolis, Indiana was recently found. Carma Purpura, a 31-year-old mother of two, was last seen at the far-southside Indianapolis truck stop. On April 10, 2008, Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi charged Mendenhall with murder in the case. DNA tests link a large quantity of the blood from Mendenhall's truck cab to the woman's parents. Investigators also found her cell phone, ATM card and clothing she wore on the day she disappeared. Four years later her remains were discovered just off I-65 in Kentucky. On July 28, police in Birmingham, Alabama charged Mendenhall with the murder of Lucille \\"Gretna\\" Carter, who was found nude in a trash bin with a plastic bag taped around her head on July 1. She was shot with a .22 caliber weapon. Investigators said Mendenhall was initially cooperative, but subsequently ceased to implicate himself in other murders. Police are investigating the possibility that Mendenhall is responsible for other murders in the region including: *Deborah Ann Glover, an Atlanta prostitute whose body was found near a Motel 6 in Suwanee, Georgia on January 29, 2007. Police are certain that Mendenhall was in Georgia on the day Glover was shot. *Sherry Drinkard, a prostitute from Gary, Indiana whose body was found naked in a snow embankment *Tammy Zywicki, a student who was found stabbed to death on September 2, 1992. She vanished from Interstate 80 near LaSalle, Illinois nine days before, after dropping off her brother at Northwestern University. *Robin Bishop, a prostitute who was run over at a Flying J truck stop on Interstate 40 in Fairview, Tennessee on July 1, 2007. *Belinda Cartwright, a hitchhiker who was run over at a truck stop in Georgia in 2001. A composite police sketch made of the suspect based on information from witnesses bears a striking resemblance to Mendenhall. Until August 2009, Mendenhall was considered in the murder of Jennifer Smith, a prostitute found nude at a truck stop in Bucksnort, Tennessee in April 2005. DNA evidence in 2009 proved that she was the second victim of killer John Wayne Boyer.

On the first occasion, 461, he was appointed by Emperor Libius Severus. This appointment ended when Severus died in 465. Two years later, in 467, he was appointed by Anthemius. His friend and chronicler, Sidonius Apollinaris, records that his first term was successful and he himself well liked. However, in his second term he found himself widely hated, and in 468 was removed from office and brought to Rome in chains. Here he was accused by envoys from a commission of influential Gauls of committing treason. The envoys brought with them a letter which Arvandus' secretary attested had been dictated by Arvandus. In it, Arvandus set out to dissuade Euric, king of the Visigoths, from concluding peace with the Eastern Roman Emperor, urging that instead he should attack the Britons north of the Loire. The letter asserted that the Law of Nations called for a division of Gaul between the Visigoths and Burgundians. Riothamus, King of the Britons, was allied to Roman Emperor Anthemius, so this was tantamount to declaring war on the Emperor. Arvandus was put on trial for treason. The trial should have been overseen by Sidonius, but Sidonius chose to resign his position instead, and plead for clemency on behalf of his friend. At his trial, Arvandus was found guilty and was stripped on the spot of all the privileges pertaining to his prefecture, and consigned to the common jail to await execution. Cassiodorus asserts that Arvandus' intention was to divide the empire and seize the throne: It may be that Arvandus was hoping to obtain the throne with aid from the Gauls and the Visigoths, in the manner of the previous attempt by Avitus. If so, Arvandus was disappointed; he received no support from the Gallic aristocracy. Possibly this was a result of his undistinguished birth, but the great majority of the Gauls would have learned from Avitus' example, and realized that the day for such adventures was long past. Cassiodorius reports that Sidonius and his friends were successful in saving Arvandus from the death penalty. \\"At the order of Anthemius, Arvandus, who had attempted to become emperor, was sent into exile\\" (\\"Arabundus imperium temptans iussu Anthemii exilio deportatur\\").

The novel concerns a xenological expedition to the planet World, where aliens live who have developed a strange form of telepathy or collective unconscious, \\"shared reality\\", which causes piercing \\"head-pain\\" whenever \\"Worlders\\" attempt to hold strongly differing opinions. Simultaneously, an artificial satellite is found in orbit of the planet which has uncharted powers, and may be the key to winning a war against a xenocidal alien race, the \\"Fallers\\". Setting The \\"Probability\\" trilogy takes place in a galaxy that has been colonized by humans. This was made possible by the space tunnels, a network of FTL warp gates that were created by a now-lost progenitor race. Humanity is not united under a common government and political system. The Terrans have also discovered a number of alien races, most of them vastly similar in body format, living conditions and even DNA, leading to the hypothesis that the aforementioned progenitor race seeded the galaxy with sentient life, which then evolved according to the conditions on each planet. Of the known alien races, humanity is the only one that has reached space. Humanity's understanding of the space tunnels is very limited, but several peculiar traits have been discovered. Firstly, if Ship A enters Tunnel 1, exits Tunnel 2 and then turns around and enters Tunnel 2 again, it will emerge from Tunnel 1 again. Unless Ship B emerges from Tunnel 2 in the interim, at which point Ship A will instead emerge from wherever Ship B entered. (The single tunnel leading to World is #438.) Secondly, objects can only enter the Tunnel if they are below a certain mass, about 100,000 tons; anything larger will actually fit into the aperture, but will collapse and explode. The threshold of what the tunnel can handle is determined by the object's Schwarzschild radius. Finally, nobody knows how the tunnels work. Macro-level quantum entanglement has been proposed, but it is so far out of the realm of current physics that nobody believes it. The space tunnels also lead to the discovery of the Fallers, an alien race who refused to establish communications and immediately launched a war, which they are winning. No Faller has been captured alivethey prefer to suicide or kamikazebut forensic examination of corpses indicate they evolved separately from humans, instead of being seeded by the progenitors. Like humanity, they were not an interstellar race until the discovery of a space tunnel in their system, though they have been closing the gap quickly. Unlike humans, they did not discover the tunnel independently; it was, in fact, a Terran craft emerging into their home system that catapulted them onto the interstellar stage. The Probability novels shares two technological quirks with another of Nancy Kress' trilogies, the Beggars trilogy. In both stories, use of both genetic modification and behavior-regulating neuropharmacological drugs is commonplace. \\"Genemods\\" are applied in vitro, whereas those who adhere to the \\"Discipline\\" administer \\"neuropharms\\" daily to control their neurotransmitter balances, in a mix that can be altered depending on the activities of one's day and the mood one hopes to approach it with. Plot synopsis Ahmed Bazargan (an Iranian) leads the team of diplomats who descend to the planet World. On his team are Dieter Gruber, a geologist; Ann Sikorski, a xenobiologist, and David Campbell Allen III, a graduate student in xenology. Their mission is to learn as much as possible about World, the Worlders and their culture, particularly the peculiar phenomenon of shared reality, which causes \\"head-pain\\" to those holding, or in the presence of someone holding, views contrary to the majority. This has had the drawback of limiting science, technology and progress; Worlders, though a far older species than Terrans, are somewhere around the Renaissance in terms of its technology. Bicycles are the cutting edge in personal transportation, each produced by artisans and individual craftsmen. On the other hand, there has never been a war on World; even the average barroom brawl causes intense head-pain. World's religion focuses on flowers; they believe that their people were created by the First Flower, which descended into the Neury Mountains, and much of their ceremony, both religious and every-day, involves blossoms. The sacredness of the mountains themselves is maintained by a wasting sickness inflicted on any who enter it. The Terran contingent was delivered by the Zeus, a warship in the rather piecemeal Solar Alliance Defense Network. The diplomatic mission is merely a cover story for the military objective, which is headed by Colonel Dr. Syree Johnson (ret.), a soldier and military physicist. The true objective involves \\"Orbital Object #7\\", one of World's seven moons (known as \\"Tas\\" by the locals). It is in very low orbit, is clearly artificial, and was created by the same unknown progenitor race that created the space tunnels. Johnson's mission is to analyze Orbital Object #7, decipher its use, and discover if it can be used as a weapon. Whether it can or not, it is about nine times too large to fit through the tunnel, and Johnson and her team can think of no way to safely disassemble it. Orbital Object #7 has fourteen bumps on the outside, each labeled with a number of their own dots: one, two, three, five, seven, eleven, and thirteen. The ancient builders' love for prime numbers is well- known; the space tunnels are marked with primes as well. It is theorized that the bumps are activating studs, and manipulating both bumps of one integer (they are on opposite sides, to avoid accidental activation by, say, a passing meteor) will trigger the artifact. When Orbital Object #7 is tested on setting one, it sends out a spherical wave that causes all nearby material higher than atomic number 75 (rhenium) to go radioactivenot by irradiating them with energy, but by manipulating the heretofore-untouchable strong nuclear force. Johnson and her team are still deciding what to do when a Faller scout craft (a \\"skeeter\\") emerges from Space Tunnel 438. The Zeus attempts to engage using particle beam weaponry, specifically a directed proton weapon, and are shocked when the beam passes through it instead of destroying it. (This has nothing to do with the strength of the weapon; proton beams utilize particles accelerated to a high percentage of the speed of light. Were the skeeter to land a shot on the Zeus, she would be destroyed as thoroughly as if vice versa. The advantage of a larger ship like the Zeus is in higher-ranged weaponry: it attacks the skeeter hours before the Faller can counterattack.) Johnson comes up with a theory that the proton beam is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and is simultaneously composed of waves and particles until it is \\"observed\\" by someone - specifically the ship it shoots - at which point it resolves into a stream of particles and destroys whatever has just observed it. Evidently, the Fallers have discovered a way to alter the beam's \\"phase complex\\" to prevent the beam from resolving; essentially, the skeeter chooses not to \\"observe\\" the proton beam and is thus unaffected by it. The skeeter, having thus proven that ignorance is bliss, performs a close fly-by of Orbital Object #7 and then departs. On World, Bazargan struggles particularly with David Allen, who is entranced by the forced altruism of shared reality and wishes to splice it into the human genome. He also liaises with the head of a rich trading family, Hadjil Pek Voratur, who sees plenty of chances for profit in the Terrans' advanced technology. He and his team, especially Pek Sikorski, are generally attended by Enli Pek Brimmidin, a household servant who picks up English with surprising speed. Enli, a point-of-view character, is a spy in the employ of the \\"Reality and Atonement\\" branch of World's government; her task is to gather information that will shed light on the question of whether Terrans are \\"real\\"that is, subject to shared reality. This is not an idle concern: those few Worlders who are born without the ability or cannot socialize to it are quietly euthanized. Enli herself has been declared unreal, having murdered her brother, and has been assigned this task as atonement. Bazargan and Ann Sikorski eventually strike a bargain with Voratur, trading the secrets of antihistamines (for Worlders, flower-sickness is sacrilegious) for a chance to perform a \\"Lagerfeld\\" brain scan on him. They agree only after Voratur takes a dose of antihistamine himself (having commissioned Enli to steal it) and survives. One of the Worlders testing the first batch of home- made drug dies from it. The Lagerfeld scan is unable to pinpoint a specific place in the Worlder brain where shared reality nests, and Ann concludes that it did not evolve and is not genetic; David Allen refuses to believe this, and begins to suspect a conspiracy between Bazargan and the high priests of World. Aboard the Zeus, Johnson and the other crew make the decision to push Orbital Object #7 out of orbit and towards Space Tunnel 438, in the hopes of breakthroughs during the five-day journey. She informs Bazargan of the action, including that, if necessary, they will destroy the artifact, possibly creating a destabilizing wave that could affect World. Bazargan goes to inform Voratur of this, only to have Voratur discover that Bazargan did not know that his mission was a cover story. This is binding proof: Terrans do not share reality. Their lives thus endangered, the Terrans, along with Enli, flee to the Neury Mountains, where no one will (or can) follow them. They are protected by environmental suits from the radiation, but they are still subject to a bizarre phenomenon: a slowing-down of the brain, a neurological phenomenon that only Enli remains unaffected by. Deep in the mountains, Gruber discovers a second alien artifact, similar to the one found in space but much smaller (perhaps 25 meters in diameter). It appears to have crash-landed on the planet millions of years ago (precipitating a mass extinction) and is putting out prodigious amounts of radiation. However, the radiation field is in the shape of a torus (a doughnut), and when the team moves into the \\"hole\\" of the field, Enli is not afflicted with the head-pains normally associated with unshared reality. Gruber theorizes that the field they passed through alters probability; this allows it to have an effect on human brain tissue because the release of neurotransmitters is a quantum-level event and thus susceptible to probability (indeed, nerve cells do not always release neurotransmitters, even when stimulated with exactly the same amount of voltage). Speeding towards Space Tunnel 438, the Zeus is confronted by a Faller cruiser, and detaches from the artifact, which continues on at over 4,000 kilometers per second. The engagement is largely inconclusive until Orbital Object #7 actually enters the tunnel. Just prior to this, Dr. Johnson receives a transmission from the diplomatic team containing Gruber's theories on the probability field, and realizes that this could explain the Fallers' new shield. However, her speculation is short-lived; when Orbital Object #7 enters the tunnel and is subsequently destroyed by it, it fires off a destabilizing wave at its maximum setting (revealed in the sequel Probability Sun to have a range of about 6 billion kilometers, and to somehow be not susceptible to the inverse square law), which destroys the Zeus as well as all Faller craft, irradiates an outer planet in the World system, and then proceeds onward to World itself. David Allen abducts Enli and drags her out of the mountains, passing through sections of high radiation to do so. Enli, wearing one of the team's four e-suits, is protected, but David takes thousands of rads. (Back with the team, Ann speculates that David is suffering from grandiose paranoid schizophrenia). The two then descend back down to civilization, where they proclaim to be real and explain that a \\"sky sickness\\" is coming. David teaches Worlders the proper techniques to shelter against radiation, and, having proclaimed his reality by dying for the sake of others, convinces the Worlders that Terrans do share reality. Meanwhile, Bazargan, Dieter and Ann receive the final transmission from the Zeus (having traveled 54 light-minutes to reach them), only to discover that Dieter's artifact reacted to the destruction of Orbital Object #7 when it was destroyed, once again implying macro-level entanglement. World is ultimately unaffected by the destabilizing wave, for reasons that are not revealed until the sequel. Armed with new hypotheses, the team is retrieved by Terran forces a few days later.

He was born as Nakagami Shōnosuke (名鏡 正之助) in Kyōbashi Yazaemon-chō in Edo (modern Tokyo) in 1859. His father, tradesman Nakagami Seijirō (名鏡 清次郎), died in 1876, and Gekkō took to work in a lantern shop in Kyōbashi Yumi-chō. Gekkō was self-taught in art, and began decorating porcelain and rickshaws, and designing flyers for the pleasure quarters. His early style shows the influence of the painter Kikuchi Yōsai. About 1881 he took the surname Ogata at the insistence of a descendant of the painter Ogata Kōrin. He soon was designing prints and illustrating books and newspapers. In 1885 Gekkō exhibited in the Painting Appreciation Society, and he became acquainted with the art scholars Ernest Fenellosa and Okakura Kakuzō. In 1886 Gekkō produced the print series Gekkō Zuihitsu (, \\"Gekkō’s Random Sketches\\"). In 1888, he married an art student of his, Tai Kiku—his second marriage—and changed his family name to Tai. He was a judge in the , which he helped found in 1891. The First Sino-Japanese War was the subject of a number of triptychs he designed in 1894–95. From the 1890s Gekkō won a number of art prizes, both national and international. He was one of the earliest Japanese artists to win international attention. At the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 he won a prize for ' (, \\"Edo’s Sannō Festival\\"), and in 1904 he won the Gold Prize for the series ' (, \\"One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji\\") at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. His work was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900 and at the Japan-British Exhibition in London in 1910. In 1898 at the Japan Art Association, Emperor Meiji bought his painting ' (, \\"Night Attack of the Soga\\"). He won third prize at the sixth in 1912. Gekkō died on 1 October 1920 in Shin-Ogawamachi in Ushigome Ward of Tokyo at age 61. His art names include Kagyōrō, Meikyōsai, Kiyū, and Rōsai. He had few students, the best-known of whom was Kōgyo Tsukioka, the adopted son of Yoshitoshi. Style The swordsmith Munechika being aided by a kitsune fox spirit, in a print by Gekkō.

(2005). \\"Ogata Gekkō\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 737. However, he did develop his own style, with significant stylistic elements from nihonga. Gekkō was among the artists whose artwork informed the Japanese populace about the progress of naval and land war known today as the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.Keene, Donald et al. (2001).

It is among the earliest known members of its genus. Described in 2006, it was of similar size to the Canada goose. It is known from a humerus bone, which differs form the living species by a wider distal end of the diaphysis, a dorsal condyle that is more rounded in dorsal view and more prominent compared to the ventral condyle in distal view, and a deeper humerotricipital sulcus in distal view. The fossil was found in a Late Miocene (Middle Turolian: European Mammal Neogene stage MN12, 7.5-6.8 million years ago) deposit at Perivolaki in Thessaly, after which region the species was named. Both near-shore freshwater bodies and open grassland habitat were found in the Perivolaki area during MN12. The species provides further support for the distinctness of Branta from the Anser grey geese by that time. It also suggests that the present biogeography of Eurasian Branta - breeding at Arctic and wintering at Mediterranean latitudes - is a product of post-Miocene times, possibly due to range shifts during the ice age era. In this aspect it is notable that such a breeding-wintering range disjunction is less pronounced in the Canada and cackling geese of North America, where unlike in there was no W-E barrier (the Alpide belt) barring range shifts in response to the advancing ice.

He produces multi-media compositions, performs in concert, and also works as a private tutor in mathematics, music theory and physics. Musical career Lawrence Ball was born in London and graduated from Queen Mary College, London University, with a BSc in Computer Science with Mathematics, then received a scholarship to Dulwich College from 1963 to 1969. He studied harmony and counterpoint with Robert Smith at the Guildhall School of Music from 1976 to 1977, piano with Tessa Uys from 1977 to 1978, and composition with composer Robert Boyle, an associate of Philip Glass, from 1978 to 1979. Ball has performed live in Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Germany, Switzerland and the UK He has accompanied the international painting group Collective Phenomena, performed with Sri Lankan master singer Manickam Yogeswaran and Californian sarod player Lisa Sangita Moskow. Ball has developed projects with healer Isobel McGilvray and worked with choreographers Sheila Styles and Rebecca Ham. He has composed for pianists Yonty Solomon and Tim Ravenscroft, violist Robin Ireland, The Smith Quartet, the Electric Symphony Orchestra and female vocal quartet Rosy Voices. He also composed music for the film The Eye of the Heart, a biography of the artist Cecil Collins. Other collaborations include work with Emily Burridge. In 1996 Ball founded the Planet Tree Music Festival, which he continues to direct, featuring in particular the composers Alan Hovhaness, Kaikhosru Sorabji and Jean Catoire. In 2006 Ball worked with composer and songwriter Pete Townshend on recordings for The Who's album Endless Wire. From 2004 to 2007 Ball also collaborated with Townshend and Dave Snowdon to set up a project called The Lifehouse Method, an Internet site where applicants could \\"sit\\" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they enter into the website. In January 2012, Navona Records released Method Music, a double album consisting of music created by Ball with assistance from Townshend using the Lifehouse Method. Harmonic mathematics A sample image generated by Lawrence Ball's harmonic maths. Ball has an interest in algorithmically generated sound, music and visuals. He was inspired by John Whitney's pre- computer and computer generated films to begin work on a branch of mathematics called harmonic mathematics in 1984. With the initial help of Michael Tusch and James Larsson, this branch of mathematics was developed on the foundation of Whitney's differential dynamics and has been applied to graphic 3D visuals, sound timbres and melodic loops which evolved from the later 1980s. Such compositions are similar to fractal and chaos sequences, but unlike fractals, are structured into time. With this input, Dave Snowdon developed a computer program in 1995 called Visual Harmony which produces graphics for live performance at musical events. In the 1980s Ball developed a series of harmonic-math generated \\"timbral transforms\\" tones which produced compositions co-authored with Isobel McGilvray, and marketed as ShapeTapes. From 1984, many of Ball's scores feature harmonic maths processes that he created without computer programs. Pete Townshend's Method software uses harmonic maths exclusively in its generation. A technical explanation of harmonic maths and their use in music composition is available on Ball's website. Works Lawrence Ball has collaborated with healers, therapists and counselors as well as writing for dance, film, popular music, orchestra and choir. His work is contemporary, related to minimalism and often considered New Age.

The canal is now derelict and no longer used. The canal was built on the south bank of the River Irwell through the area now known as Clifton Country Park. West of Pilkington's long sections of the canal are evident, although none of these sections hold water. As the canal passes through Clifton Country Park a footpath is maintained along the former towpath. Some of the original features are still evident, albeit in extremely poor condition. The canal is now completely overgrown and almost lost. A submerged boat on the canal bed, in 1986 History Between 1752 and 1756, James Brindley devised a method of pumping water from the nearby Wet Earth Colliery using power harnessed from the River Irwell via a water wheel. Around 1790-91 Matthew Fletcher began widening some of the original Brindley water channels to create a new canal, latterly known as Fletcher's Canal. In 1799 Benjamin Outram installed a lock Map of Fletcher's Canal along the canal, to avoid taking too much water. The canal construction was completed and navigable by 1800. In 1867 the original Brindley water wheel was decommissioned and replaced with a water turbine. This was replaced by a steam pump in 1924. Wet Earth Colliery was closed in 1928, and in 1952 the canal was closed and abandoned.

The title translates to \\"Adventure Boys.\\" All seven stories deal with grown men, each dealing with some aspect of his past. Some of the stories have slight fantasy elements to them, while others use flashbacks. The only common feature is a grown-up protagonist somehow coming face-to-face with his childhood past, in a testament to the loss of youth, the disillusionment of growing old, and nostalgia for better times. In the Adachi pantheon, this is a rare diametric view of his eternal theme of \\"youth,\\" in this case youth as seen through the lens of the past. Manga The series has been collected in a single tankōbon published by Shogakukan. 1\\\\. Beyond the Door Masahiko, a small business owner who returns to his hometown after several years' absence, Masahiko begins to look back on the days of his childhood and Doraemon, who helped him navigate his childhood. Masahiko then goes back to remembering helping a man who had stopped a mugger from stealing his briefcase, and how he introduces the man to a mother and young daughter who own a small pharmacy he had just met. Back in the present, Masahiko looks down sadly at the floor and asks Doraemon to \\"take me to three days ago\\". It is then we learn that the man he had introduced is actually a con man who he unknowingly helped by recommending him to the mother and daughter. Now they will lose their shop tomorrow and the daughter, who he secretly loves, will never look at him again. Just when he believes all is lost he realizes that Doraemon had actually granted his wish and, now three days in the past, he is able to warn the daughter just in time; in doing so, he is able to save his relationship and their future date. As he looks out at sky he sees Doraemon for a second and then a second later it turns into a helicopter. 2\\\\. Lost The story starts three friends (Ichi, Shiro, and Nishi) on a vacation drive in order to meet up with Daigo, another old friend. The group is hopelessly lost, which is further aggravated by the fact that they have not really talked in a while. After driving a while they accidentally pass by the abandoned house of another old friend, Mitsuo. Then abruptly they crash into the rock bed of an old river that they recognize as their old childhood hideout, Snake River. One of them tries to say \\"that's where they found Mitsuo\\" before he is angrily interrupted by another. Then some of the rocks collapse under them and the car crashes to the bank. We hear about their old friend Mitsuo, who after playing a prank on Daigo ran on the rail of the bridge but accidentally fell off. After that the group says nothing to anybody about Mitsuo and they believe that is why they being haunted. It is then that they see a ghostly apparition that looks like Mitsuo, who leads them to the bridge of the accident. Then the true story is then revealed: Mitsuo, after the fight, tried to settle their dispute by showing Daigo a trick on the bridge but the moss on the bridge made him slip and fall. Because they didn't say anything, there was an awkward space between them that made the rest of their life with each other uncomfortable. Mitsuo, as his final wish, shows them how pointless that awkwardness was. The story closes with Daigo waiting for his friends, looking at his latest piece of art: a wood sculpture of all five of them. 3\\\\. Hero Kamisato is an average mild mannered worker who lives his life without much conflict. while at work one day, he goes to the bathroom when his boss, Mr. Honjo, comments on his build and asks him if he played any sports. One of his coworkers, Kodama, answers for him, saying the only thing he does is make model trains. When his boss gives him permission to hit him if he is angry he refuses, calmly saying that it is actually his hobby, and allows his coworker to more than playfully punch him in the stomach. He enters a coffee shop and meets Ms. Takasaka (a coworkers) and when she can't find her wallet he pays for her coffee as a birthday present. She then tells Takamaru that when it his birthday she will pay for his coffee or lunch. The next day, he goes to work and sees Ms. Takasaka again and Mr. Honjo who firmly states that he is now courting Ms. Takasaka and if anyone would like to compete he must only say so. Kodama then answers that no one would compete with him, seeing how smart and attractive he is. Many of them agree and congratulate Ms. Takasaka on her success. Kamisota remembers the times when he never lost a match with anyone in wrestling, but when he was challenged by one of his victims to fight his meaner older brother, he chickened out and just assumed Takamaru, his sidekick, did as well. He then shuffles through his mail and sees an invitation to a pro-wrestling match by none other than his old friend Takamaru. He remembers that as a child he would idolize those wrestlers as invincible men. Takamaru it turns on that day fought on his own and lost terribly, and while he had never lost a fight, he had grown into a coward while Takamaru grew into a famous professional wrestler. He then enters the stadium and Takamaru, who had become famous for roughing up the fans, sees Kamisato; instead of greeting him, he punches him in the face. When asked if he is all right, Kamisato smiles and says \\" He always knew I would come here and get beat up sometime\\". The next day, Kamisato sees Mr. Honjo and Ms. Takasaka go into a car; instead of politely moving out of the way, he says that today is his birthday and he would like to have lunch with her, to which she happily agrees. Kodama then pops up and asks him what he thinks he is doing trying to talk to Ms. Takasaka. Mr. Honjo offers him the same deal as before but, Kamisato replies he can take responsibility for himself and punches Kodama in the face. 4\\\\. Sky Blue Arch 5\\\\. Transmission 6\\\\.

They are characterized by an alternation between two entities. In the examples described below, these entities are communication partners, network paths or file blocks. Databases In most database management systems durable database transactions are supported through a log file. However, multiple writes to the same page of that file can produce a slim chance of data loss. Assuming for simplicity that the log file is organized in pages whose size matches the block size of its underlying medium, the following problem can occur: If the very last page of the log file is only partially filled with data and has to be written to permanent storage in this state, the very same page will have to be overwritten during the next write operation. If a crash happens during that later write operation, previously stored log data may be lost. The Ping-Pong scheme described in Transaction Processing eliminates this problem by alternately writing the contents of said (logical) last page to two different physical pages inside the log file (the actual last page i and its empty successor i+1). Once said logical log page is no longer the last page (i.e. it is completely filled with log data), it is written one last time to the regular physical position (i) inside the log file. This scheme requires the usage of time stamps for each page in order to distinguish the most recent version of the logical last page one from its predecessor. Networking =Internet= A functionality which lets a computer A find out whether a computer B is reachable and responding is built into the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). Through an \\"echo request\\" Computer A asks B to send back an \\"Echo response\\".

She was scrapped in 1975. History USS Rhodes was named in honor of Lieutenant (junior grade) Allison Phidel Rhodes who was killed in action aboard the light cruiser during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November 1942. Rhodes was laid down by the Brown Shipbuilding Company at Houston, Texas on 19 April 1943, and was launched 29 June 1943. Her sponsor was Mrs. C. E. Rhodes, mother of Lieutenant (junior grade) Rhodes, and was commissioned in October 1943, Lieutenant Commander E. A. Coffin Jr. of the United States Coast Guard in command. =World War II= Battle of the Atlantic Following shakedown off Bermuda, Rhodes, manned by a Coast Guard crew and assigned to CortDiv 23, steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, thence to New York City to escort a convoy back to Norfolk. Returning to Norfolk 2 January 1944, she served as a training ship for prospective destroyer escort crews until the 13th, then sailed east, escorting convoy UGS-30 to Gibraltar, where ships of the Royal Navy relieved CortDiv 23. Returning 23 February, she departed Norfolk 13 March for Bizerte escorting the 98-ship convoy UGS-36. Two days out of Bizerte, 1 April, the convoy was attacked by German bombers and torpedo planes. In the quarter-hour engagement, the escorts and naval gun crews splashed five of the Luftwaffe's \\"eagles\\" and kept damage to the \\"prey\\" to one cargo ship, which was subsequently towed to Oran. On the 3d the convoy reached Lake Bizerte and on the 11th got underway for New York, arriving 2 May. Availability, and exercises at Casco Bay, preceded another convoy run to Bizerte where Allied forces were gathering to push further into Axis-occupied Europe. Rhodes completed that run at Boston, Massachusetts, 11 July and, after availability, shifted to the North Atlantic sealanes, escorting six convoys to the United Kingdom and France during the remainder of the war in Europe. Pacific War Following the surrender of Nazi Germany, Rhodes was transferred, with her division, to the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal in mid-June 1945, she sailed north, arriving at Adak 8 July and reporting to Commander, Alaskan Sea Frontier, for duty as an escort and air-sea rescue vessel. Detached a week later and temporarily assigned to Task Force TF 92, she escorted that fleet's service group during anti-shipping strikes in the Sea of Okhotsk and the bombardment of the Kuriles (15–21 July). Then resuming operations for the Alaskan Sea Frontier, she remained in the Aleutians until mid-November, when she sailed for Okinawa. Arriving at Buckner Bay 25 November, she joined the U.S. 7th Fleet and in December got underway for Tsingtao, where she supported occupation troops until 11 February 1946. She then sailed for the east coast of the United States. Rhodes retransited the Panama Canal 19 March and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, to begin inactivation on the 25th. Assigned to the Florida Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, she moved south in April and decommissioned 13 June 1946. =Cold War= Rhodes remained berthed at Mayport, Florida, until 24 July 1954, when she got underway for Norfolk to begin conversion to a radar picket escort ship. Reclassified DER-384, 1 December 1954, she recommissioned 1 August 1955 and on 12 September reported for duty in the Atlantic Fleet. Assigned to ComCortRon 16, Rhodes conducted exercises in the Caribbean until late November, then returned to Norfolk, Virginia, where she remained into the new year, 1956. Then sailing north, she arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, her homeport, 10 January and commenced 8 years of service on the Atlantic Barrier Patrol, the seaward extension of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line. During that period she served on various stations from Argentia to the Azores, interspersing such duty with exercises and operations in the Caribbean, including, in October–November 1962, participation in the Cuban Quarantine. In 1963 Rhodes was again ordered inactivated and in April she steamed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to begin preparations. =Decommissioning and fate= Decommissioned 10 July 1963, the destroyer escort was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1974 and sold for scrap to Union Minerals and Alloys Corp., New York, New York, on 1 March 1975.

Probably due to the persecutions by Shapur II, Marolus moved before 380 to Syria where he grew up. He later moved to Rome, where he became friend of Pope Innocent I, and finally to Milan, where he became the bishop in 408. Marolus was the bishop of Milan during an invasion of Italy by the Visigoths and he helped the victims of the invasion. He probably took in Milan from Antioch the relics of saints Babylas of Antioch and Romanus of Caesarea, and he founded a church in Milan known as Basilica Concilia Sanctorum or church of San Romano, today no more extant, near the present church of San Babila.

The BINCI has also been referred to as the \\"Charry Solano battalion,\\" after its original chief, Brigadier General Ricardo Charry Solano. It has also been known as the Twentieth Brigade or Brigade XX. Controversy =Triple A= During the years of its operation, the BINCI was considered the Colombian National Army's primary counter-intelligence unit and under direct operational control of the E-2 Army intelligence directorate in Bogotá, Colombia. A declassified 1979 report from the United States Embassy in Bogotá, published in 2007 by the National Security Archive, mentioned that there was a plan for the BINCI to form a paramilitary operation under the guise of the Alianza Americana Anticomunista (AAA). The report describes the goal of the formation of the AAA as \\"to create the impression that the American Anti- communist Alliance has established itself in Colombia and is preparing to take violent action against local communists.\\" The BINCI, acting as the AAA, has been linked to the December 1978 bombing of the Colombian Communist Party Headquarters, the bombing of the Communist Party newspaper Voz Proletaria. It has also been accused of engaging in other kidnappings, bombings and assassinations against leftist targets and guerrilla detainees. =Forced Disappearance= On August 30, 1987, Nydia Erika Bautista de Arellana was kidnapped by a group of undercover operatives identified as part of Brigade XX. Nydia Erika was 30 years old and had previously been detained due to her student activism and membership in the Movimiento 19 de Abril () (M-19) guerrilla group. On September 12, 1987, her body was found, showing signs that she had been shot once in the head execution style. On July 9, 1995, Colombia's Procurator-Delegate for Human Rights, Hernando Valencia Villa, announced the conclusions of a disciplinary investigation into the 1987 \\"disappearance\\", torture and murder of Nydia Erika Bautista and called for Brigadier General Álvaro Hernán Velandia Hurtado and an army sergeant to be expelled from the armed forces. It was found that the then commander of Brigade XX for which the \\"Charry Solano\\" Army Battalion was attached, was fully aware of the capture, disappearance, torture and murder of Nydia Erika Bautista by men under his command and that he had had the \\"duty, power and opportunity to prevent this serious crime from being committed\\". =Assaults= On February 27, 1998, the BINCI was implicated by Colombian government investigators in the murders of human rights workers; lawyer Jesús María Valle, president of the \\"Héctor Abad Gómez\\" Permanent Committee for Human Rights in Antioquia and human rights lawyer Eduardo Umaña. In May 1998 the Twentieth Brigade assaulted the offices of Justicia y Paz () where they were reported to have ransacked the offices and forced nuns and human rights workers to their knees and placed guns to their heads.Human Rights Watch interviews with government investigators, Santafé de Bogotá, May 7–8, 1998. On May 19, 1998, the BINCI was disbanded pending a reorganization, in part due to their participation in human rights abuses.

Each leg was staged prior to the beginning of the regular season and was considered the curtain-raiser for the new BBL campaign. The winner was decided over a total aggregate score over the two game series. History The competition was first announced on 13 July 2007 with the inaugural series taking place between Guildford Heat (BBL Cup winners 2006-07) and Plymouth Raiders (BBL Trophy winners 2006-07). The first leg, which took place on 9 September in Plymouth, saw a tight affair finish 83-77 to the visiting Guildford Heat, despite the Raiders clawing back from an 18-point deficit to take the lead during the third quarter. Another close game in the second leg played in Guildford the following weekend, on 15 September, saw the Guildford Heat defeat the Plymouth Raiders 93-91 and claim the inaugural BBL Cup Winners' Cup 176-168 on aggregate. The second edition saw Trophy winners Heat competing to retain their crown against the 2008 BBL Cup winners Milton Keynes Lions. The first leg, played in Milton Keynes on 14 September, saw the visitors claim a slender advantage to win 89-91. The second leg, on 19 September, was almost as close and finished 68-60 to the home-court Heat, resulting in a 10-point aggregate victory for the Guildford Heat, who retained the Cup.

The company also has a distribution warehouse in Toronto. In 2000, new owners acquired the company: Mike Stirrup and Doug Dawkins. Unlike many small breweries making Beer in Canada, Wellington has not been acquired by a major brewer; hence, the company now bills itself as Canada's oldest independently owned craft brewery, despite being predated by B.C.'s Spinnakers Brewpubhttps://www.hellobc.com/stories/30-years-of-craft-beer-in-bc/ and Vancouver Island Brewinghttps://vibrewing.com/company/ (both founded in 1984).

Life and work Little of his work has survived, except the settings for four voices of the Souterliedekens, 150 Dutch Psalm Songs and canticles, possibly written by nobleman Willem van Zuylen van Nijevelt and published in 1540 with a notation of the melody for one voice. Mes's settings appeared in Antwerp in 1561 as the eighth up to the eleventh volume of the Musijck Boexkens, a collection of Dutch songs edited by Tielman Susato. In this series, Susato had already published Jacobus Clemens non-Papa's Psalm settings for three voices in 1556-57. As was already the case with the Dutch secular songs from Susato's Ierste and Tweetste Musijck Boexken (first and second Music Book), performance with human voices as well as with instruments is suggested in the edition of Mes's Psalm settings. On the title page of the Souterliedekens, Mes is also mentioned as a pupil of Clemens non-Papa, which is the only fact we know about his life. Of his Souterliedekens, no complete copy has survived; the bass voice is missing. In his Souterliedekens, Mes made use of several writing techniques: sometimes, he used the original tune of a Psalm Song from the collection published in 1540 in the soprano voice (while Clemens used the tunes in the tenor voice); sometimes he wrote an entirely new composition, in which now and then was initially borrowed from the original tune whereupon the composition goes its own way. In a number of cases, Mes used an existing tune, but another one as Clemens did. Mes's Souterliedekens were apparently still popular in the seventeenth century; some of them were used by the Delft priest and poet Stalpart van der Wiele. An attempt to reconstruct the Souterliedekens's missing bass voice, was undertaken by Louis Peter Grijp. Apart from his Souterliedekens, only one other piece of music by Mes has survived; a motet.

In 1634, Russian Cossacks, headed by Voin Shakhov, established a winter settlement at the confluence of the Vilyuy and Tyukyan rivers.

The edifice was dedicated primarily to \\"Antaeus\\", who represented a warrior fusion of Seth and Horus.

Known for her minimalist approach, she often synthesizes improvisation and through-composed material. Biography Born in Syracuse, New York, Speach earned her B.S. in Music Education from the College of Saint Rose in 1971. Five years later, while studying abroad in Siena, Italy, she was introduced to Franco Donatoni and Morton Feldman. She went on to study with Feldman, alongside composers Lejaren Hiller and Leo Smit, at SUNY Buffalo, where she finished her M.A. and Ph.D. in Music Composition, and before that studied under Jacques Louis Monod and Nicolas Rousakis at Columbia University. Although trained in the classical idiom, Speach is equally rooted in jazz, and in the latter vein includes room for aleatory elements in her compositions, ranging from solo and chamber to orchestral and vocal/choral works. An example is her second string quartet, les ondes pour quatre (1988), which blends fixed and free durations. Notable performers of her work include the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra under Lukas Foss, the Absolute Chamber Orchestra under Kristjan Järvi, pianist Ursula Oppens, saxophonist Oliver Lake, Duo Avanzando, pianist Anthony de Mare, the Soldier String Quartet, soprano Joan LaBarbara, Arditti String Quartet, and cellist Frances-Marie Uitti. Her music has been programmed in such venues as Roulette Intermedium (NYC), Festival International de Musica (São Paulo, Brazil), the Ravinia Festival (Highland Park, IL), Merkin Hall (NYC), Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, MN), the Internationales Musikinstitut (Darmstadt, Germany), and the Knitting Factory (NYC). Her large-scale work Embrace the Universe (2001), for orchestra, mixed chorus, soprano, viola and piano was premiered May 9, 2016 at Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari, Italy. In 2010, she was commissioned by the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center to compose a piece as part of pianist Anthony de Mare’s “Liaisons: Re-imagining Sondheim from the Piano.” The result was In and Out of Love and received its premiere at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in 2011. Inspired by “Liaisons” and “Send in the Clowns” from Stephen Sondheim’s A Little Night Music, In and Out of Love was released September 2015 as part of a 3-CD set of the entire “Liaisons” project recorded by de Mare for the ECM label to critical acclaim. Its producer, Judith Sherman, received a Grammy Award for Classical Producer of the Year. Other commissions have come from percussionist Ricardo Souza (Only/Solimente for solo vibraphone, 2004), soprano Lauralyn Kolb (Set of Three for soprano and piano, 2005), the National Endowment for the Arts 1992 (Parallel Windows – Unframed for piano and orchestra, 1996), the Minnesota Composers Forum 1992 (Avanzando for bass clarinet, piano, marimba, vibraphone and glockenspiel, 1993), iEAR Studios/Department of the Arts/Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 1989 (9/8/89 for digital sampler and tape, 1990), the Manhattan Neighborhood Network/The Kitchen Video Workshop, 1995-96 (Angels in the Snow, a film/video documentary with solo piano), and the New York State Council on the Arts, 1992 (Baobab 4 for flute, clarinet, alto saxophone, trombone, acoustic and electric guitar, bass, two pianos, balafon, reciter, three women’s voices and dancer, 1994). Speach has been composer-in-residence at the Brooklyn College Electroacoustic Studio (2002), received a fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts (1998–99), and received grants and awards from Arts Midwest (1993), Margaret Fairbank Jory Copying Assistance Program (1989 & 1997), and Meet the Composer (1985-2001). She is also a seasoned improviser—sharing performances with her husband, guitarist/composer Jeffrey Schanzer and poet Thulani Davis, among others—and as pianist is regarded for her interpretations of the keyboard repertoire of John Cage, including In a landscape and his pieces for toy piano. Speach is a lifelong teacher and arts administrator. Before her current post at SUNY Adirondack, she held positions at Darmstadt (1988), The New School (1994–98), SUNY Purchase (2005), the College of Saint Rose (2009–14), and Brooklyn College (2001–08, 2012–13), and has been a guest lecturer at many others besides. She has also served as panelist and advisor for a large number of organizations, including Colorado Council on the Arts, Jerome Foundation, Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, New Music America Festivals, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New York State Council on the Arts. She also served as executive director for The Kitchen (1996–98) and Composers’ Forum, Inc. (1986-1990) in New York City. She continues to vitalize the northeastern United States music scene through her multiple roles as fundraiser, presenter, and educator, seeking new relationships between sounds and their interpreters.

The building that now houses the Centre was constructed in 1898 and originally served as Moncton's first secondary school, known as Aberdeen High School. The school was named for the then Governor General Lord Aberdeen, who laid the cornerstone of the edifice shortly before its completion. The building was reconstructed following a terrible fire in 1916 and remained a functioning high school for decades thereafter. When the Aberdeen School—alma mater of Northrop Frye, world-renowned author and literary critic—closed its doors in the late 1970s, at that time it was a French elementary school since Moncton High School was established, Aberdeen was about to take on a new vocation.

It is sometimes necessary because of the legal requirement for trailer lighting. Furthermore, from a technical perspective, it is used for wiring the two vehicles together to power and synchronize their lighting systems. A trailer light converter assists in adapting the differences in voltage and the number of wires. Most basic trailers in Canada and USA usually have only one light (with one wire) on each side that functions as both a turn signal and a brake light (though sometimes there is a separate yellow and red light for signal and brake lighting). The brake signal from the towing vehicle usually needs to be received by the converter and then sent to both the left and right trailer lights. Wiring Trailer light converters generally follow a 4 wire electrical color scheme.

Trailer light wiring options  Depending on the towing equipment of a vehicle, there are possible installation variants: * Some newer vehicles come equipped with the tow-ready package from the factory. Such setup means, that the vehicle will have the factory connection for the trailer harness in the rear bumper. For that setup it is enough to attach the vehicle to the trailer with the right connector. * If the newer vehicle is not equipped with the trailer package for the factory, the owner will have to install the vehicle-specific T-connector first. This connector is the direct vehicle-to-trailer harness, that will supply the trailer with the power. In such setup, the 4-way harness will have to be routed to the rear end of the vehicle. * The older vehicles usually do not feature the pre-installed trailer connectors from the factory. Such vehicles require a universal wiring kit to connect the trailer to the vehicle. Usually, installation of such a connector takes around an hour.

The ponds we can see today are those spared by a 19th-century campaign of drying the wetlands of the Maalbeek valley between La Cambre Abbey and Eugène Flagey Square. The two long and narrow ponds, whose total lengths are approximately , and widths are approximately , are aligned on a roughly North-South axis and are separated by a narrow strip of land. With the surrounding park, the Ixelles Ponds are the tip of a long strip of almost uninterrupted greenery reaching all the way from the Sonian Forest deep into Brussels' urban tissue. The ponds are an extremely popular recreation area for local residents pertaining to the Belgian upper-crust. However, in the late 1990s the water was polluted with cyanobacteria.

It was developed in 1958 and entered service in 1962. The missile was normally armed with a conventional high-explosive warhead, although it could be fitted with a one-megaton nuclear warhead. Development Flight testing of the missile as part of the K-16 weapon system in 1958, with two missiles being carried on BD-352 pylons under the wings of a modified Tu-16 bomber designated as Tu-16KSR-2. The bomber was fitted with a newly developed Roobin-1K (Ruby) search and target illumination radar which has a maximum range of approximately 200 kilometers. During the tests, missiles were fired at ships and ground targets. Description The missile itself, like the earlier KS-1, is extremely large, nearly nine meters in length with a wingspan of approximately four and a half meters and weighing 4,000 kilograms. It has swept wings with two wing fences on each wing. The K-16 system was accepted into Soviet Navy service in 1962. Egypt purchased a number of the K-16 systems. An updated version of the missile entered service in 1967 designated the KSR-2M. It borrowed some features from the KSR-5 missile (NATO:AS-6 \\"Kingfisher\\") including a new Isayev S5.6.0000 rocket motor. This allowed the new missile to be launched from altitudes as low as 500 meters rather than the previous 1,500 meters. The missile was prepared for launch by the navigator; the degree of automation provided by the Roobin-1K eliminated the need for a separate radar operator. For propulsion it used a liquid-fueled twin-chamber rocket motor that delivered 1,200 kgp in boost mode and 700 kgp in cruise mode. The fuel consisted of the TG-02 (sometimes TT-S2) fuel and AK-20F oxidizer which were toxic and highly corrosive, which made ground handling of the missile difficult. Once the launching aircraft's radar has locked onto a target, the missile can be launched. The rocket motor fires immediately after release in boost mode, accelerating the missile to its cruise speed. Once the missile turns on an approach course to the target, the motor switches to cruise mode, shutting down one of its chambers. The missile's autopilot then flies a course using inertial guidance toward the target. In anti-shipping mode the missile engages its J-band active radar in the final approach to the target. Variants An anti-radar variant of the missile designated KSR-11 was also produced, being externally almost identical to the KSR-2. The KSR-11 was intended to home in on and destroy air-defence radar and ECM facilities. The missile used a 2PRG-11 passive radar seeker. A target drone version of the missile designated KRM-2 (MV-1) also entered service in 1966, with a different rocket motor, a range of 376 kilometers and a level flight endurance of 433 seconds. Combat history Egyptian Tu-16 bombers reportedly launched 13 KSR-2 and 12 KSR-11 missiles during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. One of the Kelt missiles launched at Tel Aviv from Tu-16 was shot down by an IAF jet.

Pelley Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past Page 253 2002 \\"... in the dissident Nhân văn–Giai phẩm Affair, Phan Khôi's involvement with the Research Committee was exceedingly brief.\\"Thu-Hương Nguyễn-Võ The Ironies of Freedom: Sex, Culture, and Neoliberal Governance in Vietnam. (9780295988504) - Page 68 2008 \\"..and from 1956 to 1958 with cultural opposition in the form of the ill-fated Nhân Văn–Giai Phẩm movement ...\\" Two periodicals were established during that time, Nhân Văn (, Humanities) and Giai Phẩm (, Masterpieces), many issues of which were published demanding freedom of speech, creativity and human rights. Following a loosening of political restrictions with some similarities to the Chinese Hundred Flowers Campaign, there was a hardening of attitudes. After those two major journals were closed down, their political associates were imprisoned or reeducated. Moreover, the agenda of Nhân Văn-Giai Phẩm was linked to \\"reactionary\\" political projects by North Vietnamese government.  Historical Contexts  = 1954 Geneva Accords = The 1954 Geneva Accords marked the end of anti-French struggle and provided the Viet Minh with prestige and authority. After the close of the Geneva Conference, the VWP faced two fundamental tasks: to reconstruct the north and to unify the south. To rebuild the north, the VWP leadership continued to look to China for assistance and China immediately began to offer aid to help the DRV. But the reconstruction efforts in the DRV following the First Indochina War underwent many trials and tribulations. The 1954 Geneva Accords on Nhan Van-Giai Pham facilitated enormous emigration from the north to the south from July 1954 to May 1955. The mass migration added to the social disorder generated by the other contemporary political reforms in North Vietnam. = The Rise of de- Stalinization = The key global preludes of Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair may be located in the ups and downs of reform and repression that dominated political life in the eastern bloc and China throughout the turbulent years of the 1950s. Most significant was the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the rise of currents of de-Stalinization promoted by political elites, and the growth of agitation throughout the Eastern bloc on the part of workers, intellectuals, and students. This course was the so-called Liberalization, which accelerated in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech denouncing the crimes of Stalin in Feb 1956. The uprisings in Eastern bloc later that year brought this era of high de-Stalinization which inspired and stimulated not only the Soviet bloc, but many intellectuals within Chinese and North Vietnamese state-party. = Impact of the imitation from Chinese models = During the Cold War, the Sino-Soviet relations greatly complicated North Vietnam's reconstruction and the path toward reunification. By the 1950s, Ha Noi faced two different modes of revolution: peaceful reunification through socialist development of the North and violent reunification through liberation struggle in the South, due to the separate ideology between Moscow and Beijing. For the North Vietnam, the close connection, promoted by geographical, historical and cultural links with China was much deeper than those with the Soviet Union. In this context, Vietnamese developments in the era of de-Stalinization had more connections with China than with the USSR. However, the Soviet Union continued to be considered by the Vietnamese communists as the ideological center of the world communist movement. After the cancellation of 1956 nationwide election, both Beijing and Moscow encouraged Ho Nai to continue its political and economic reconstruction within the North. While Chinese influence in the North Vietnamese political reforms should be considered in a totally different light. Three in particular political movements were causing widespread discontent in North Vietnam which were all resulted from DRV's imitation of the Chinese model, including the rectification campaign, the land reform and the correction of errors. In 1950s, Ho Chi Minh made an official visit to China to sign a military aid agreement with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership in Beijing. With the introduction of Chinese military aid came the massive influx of Chinese-styled institutions, reforms and advisors. A massive organizational rectification campaign was launched to study the Chinese 1942 Yan\`an campaign, and thousands of cadres were purged. Almost at the same time, a two-phase land reform campaign modeled on china's was also put into action from 1953 to 1956. This alarmed many intellectuals because most had ties to the landlord classes more or less. Since many intellectuals were labeled \\"class enemies\\", a new label of \\"progressive personalities\\" was created for them if they voluntarily surrendered all their property to the state, in addition to serving the revolution. The twin notorious movements of the rectification campaign and the land reform cause serious damage not only on old structures in the village but on the party apparatus, which might have sowed chaos. In August 1956, the party admitted serious problems with the land reform, and it launched a period of \\"correction of errors\\" in October the same year. Nevertheless, official acknowledgement of land reform errors could not prevent, or perhaps generated further discord in the countryside, such as a violent peasant rebellion in Nghe An province in November 1956. Although the chaos occurred in the countryside, the whole country was in disorder. Many urban intellectuals who had been mobilized by the party to participate in the campaigns stoked the atmosphere of dissent in North Vietnam. Moreover, the fact that those series of movements were inspired by Maoist that stimulated other unpopular policies of the new regime that contributed to a belief that the Vietnamese revolution was a misplaced enthusiasm for the Chinese model. = Hundred Flowers Movement in China = Both China and North Vietnam were influenced by the currents of de-Stalinization during that time, while the North Vietnamese case suggests a more direct influence from China. With the criticism of de-Stalinization by Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) pursued a high key official campaign against independent intellectuals such as Hu Feng in 1955. But, in a stunning reversal, it launched the famous liberal Hundred Flowers movement the following year with the eulogizing of Mao Zedong himself. Following a year during which intellectuals were encouraged to air in public grievances about the party and its policies, the CCP abruptly reversed course again. In 1957, it shut down the Hundred Flowers movement and launched an \\"anti-rightist campaign\\" designed to root out and punish intellectuals who had exposed themselves during the previous year. Same way in North Vietnam, a Vietnamese intellectual Tran Dan was inspired and encouraged by Hu Feng and published Nhan Van magazine in 1955. Then the party was aware of the close connection between Tran Dan and Hu Feng, and it should not be a surprise that when Tran Dan was purged and arrested in February 1956, six months after Hu Feng was imprisoned, the rationale for some cadres involved in the arrest was \\"China has Hu Feng, perhaps we also have a Hu Feng.\\" Tran Dan\`s arrest marked the start of Nhan Van Giai Pham affair.  Nhân Văn and Giai phẩm Journals  =Nhân Văn journal, 1955-1956= The official address of the Nhân Văn (\\"humanities\\") paper was 27 Hang Khay, Hanoi. Its editor was Phan Khôi, and its secretary was Tran Duy. The Nhân Văn group consisted of the dissident North Vietnamese intellectuals from 1955–58. This group was led by Phan Khôi, a revolutionary from Quảng Nam. Most of these intellectuals had participated in the movement against French colonialism. After the first phase of land reform, they became disillusioned and started a political movement demanding political freedom and democracy. =Giai phẩm Mùa xuân journal, 1956= The first edition of Giai Pham Mùa xuân (\\"Works of Spring\\"), also edited by Phan Khôi, was published in March, 1956. By December 1956, they had published two issues (Fall and Spring) of Giai Phẩm and five issues of Nhân Văn. Among intellectuals that joined the group around the two journals were the lawyer Nguyễn Mạnh Tường, Dr Đặng Văn Ngữ, scholar Đào Duy Anh, philosopher Trần Đức Thảo, poets Trần Dần, Hoàng Cầm, Phùng Quán, Quang Dũng, Văn Cao, Nguyễn Hữu Đang, Lê Đạt and painter Bùi Xuân Phái.  Events of the Nhân Văn-Giai phẩm Period  = Prelude (late 1954-1955) = Prior to the founding of Nhân Văn and Giai Phẩm journals, there was an insurgent campaign waged within the army to loosen censorship imposed on military writers and artists. In February 1955, about thirty writers and artists in the army drafted a resolution to the party's central committee \\"demanding the abolition of the General Political Bureau\`s leadership over arts and letters in the army.\\", which included three demands: \\"1) hand over the leadership of arts and letters to the artists and writers; 2) establish an arts and letters association within the structure of army organization; 3) abolish the existing military regime insofar as it affects the artists and writers serving in the armed forces.\\" In the same month, they proposed a political petition based on the above three requests, but the petition was rejected. The leading figure of this dissenting intellectual campaign was Tran Dan, a soldier-poet who became disenchanted with Maoist cultural policy following a two-month study tour to China in late 1954. as we can see that, however, Tran Dan was in China at the height of the Hu Feng crisis. Hu Feng, a literary critic and longtime member of the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to the central committee in July 1954 that criticized his grievances on the party's literary authority figures. Although he had no intention of challenging party authority, Hu Feng's action reflected a wide range of intellectuals and artists\` grievances and was taken as evidence of the earliest cleavage between the party and intellectuals after the formation of the PRC. Hu Feng was arrested in July 1955, and the campaign against him broadened into a campaign to reeducate the masses and reinforce the official line. After Hu Feng's personal letters were published, there is no doubt that Tran Dan was exposed to the materials related to Hu Feng's letter, and later his friends acknowledged the connection between Hu Feng and Tran Dan in a cartoon published in Nhan Van, the most influential Vietnamese dissident magazine. As a result, Tran Dan was also arrested in February 1956, six month later than Hu Feng's imprisoned. The failure of Tran Dan-led insurgent campaign significantly frustrated the intellectuals who naively believed that their contribution to the revolution had won the party's trust, and thus prepared the ground for the intellectuals\` more radical challenge to the party the following year. = The golden age of Nhan Van-Giai Pham (Feb.1956-Nov.1956) = The second stage of Nhan Van-Giai Pham was most liberal from the appearance of the first issue of Giai Pham in February 1956, although shortly after Tran Dan was arrested, and until late November 1956. In particular from August to November 1956, the movement experienced its golden age. The coincidence of the publication of the first issue of Giai Pham and Khrushchev's Secret Speech raised the prospect that a period of liberalization was forthcoming. Indeed, the international circumstances had turned favorable to the intellectuals during this stage. Both the Twentieth Congress and the Chinese Double-Hundred policy had immediate impact upon the relationship between Vietnamese intellectuals and the party. and allowed Vietnamese intellectuals the space to vigorously voice their concerns. The Soviet first deputy premier went to Beijing and Hanoi in April 1956 in order to introduce the new Soviet line. In the same month Tran Dan was released from prison, mainly because of the change in international atmosphere. Domestically, a similarly liberal atmosphere dominated the Tenth Plenum of the VWP in September during which party leaders \\"correction of errors\\" of the land reform and called for a revival of \\"democratic rights\\" and the \\"people\`s freedom.\\" after that, many issues of Nhan Van and Giai Pham appeared, along with other independent journals came out intermittently, including Tram hoa (Hundred flowers), Noi that (Speak truth), Tap san phe binh (Criticism newsletter), Sang tao (Creativity), and Dai moi (New land). At the August 1956 Conference of the Vietnamese Literary Association, intellectuals openly demanded greater freedom, just as their counterparts in China and the Soviet Union were doing at that time. In September, five issues of the independent journal Nhan Van were permitted to publish, along with many other private publications that rallied dissenting intellectuals and flooded news-stands, symbolized a unique time of liberalization was represented. In an attempt to influence these publishing ventures and to stop the wave of criticism, the Van Hghe, which was an official weekly newspaper for literature and the arts, published a \\"self- criticism\\" of Hoai Thanh. Nevertheless, in that period, the DRV held a provisional tolerate official stance toward the directness of the writers and artists. = Incomplete repression (Nov.1956-early 1957) = After the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt in early November 1956 and the outbreak of rural riot in Quynh Luu, the liberal stage of Nhan Van-Giai Pham ended. Instead,the Viet Minh began to strike back against the intellectuals by publishing editorials and commentaries and even \\"letters from audiences\\" to condemn anti-socialist elements. In the meanwhile, government began to harass the editors of Nhan Van-Giai Pham by accusing them of breaking the law for failing to deposit three copies of the journal with the Central Press Office prior to publication. A more aggressive campaign against Nhan Van-Giai Pham was launched after the sixth issue of Nhan Van was seized. The campaign featured the contemporary publications to denunciate the movement. The entry from Cuu quoc reflected the high degree of belligerence of the campaign: > Nhan Van distorted the truth, exaggerated facts, made up stories, sowed > doubts and pessimism in our regime, our party and our government, and > created an atmosphere of mistrust and division within our ranks: between > soldiers and the army, between the people and the authorities, between the > members and non-members of the party, and even between leaders and the > masses. At the same time, the campaign also labeled the Nhan Van Giai Pham as \\"reactionary\\" political agenda. After more than a month of such campaign, on 18 December, the Hanoi Administrative Committee suspended the two journals of Nhan Van and Giai Pham, closed other publishing houses and confiscated the copies of previous issues. But the storm of political condemnation toward Nhan Van-Giai Pham quickly passed away by the early 1957. For the reasons that remain vague (which possibly related to the ongoing Hundred Flowers campaign in China), the party-state stopped its anti-Nhan Van Giai Pham campaign, and no one arrested or fired among all those targeted in this campaign. = The second liberal period (Feb.1957-Dec.1957) = Same as the second stage of the movement following the Tran Dan\`s case, this new stage was characterized by a mixture of official moderate repression and tolerance toward the leaders of Nhan Van-Giai Pham and their ongoing activities within the public domain. In May, a new literary weekly, Van (\\"literature\\") appeared as the organ of the newly formed Writers\` Association. Under the banner of Van the authors for Nhan Van and Giai Pham quickly rallied. Influenced by the end of the Hundred Flowers movement and the onset of the anti-rightist campaign in China during July 1957 in some way, Van, was harshly criticized in an article in Hoc Tap (\\"studies\\"), but such criticism never led to an orchestrated press campaign or forced the writers to be silent. In short, the cultural atmosphere in North Vietnam for most of 1957 was mild and tolerant at least. = The end of Nhan Van-Giai Pham (Jan.1958) = This above resumed liberalization lasted for almost one year and was finally ended in early 1958. On 6 January 1958 the politburo of the party issued the \\"Politburo Resolution on Literary Affairs,\\" demanding the expulsion of all \\"subversive elements\\" from literary organizations and requiring the education of intellectuals with Marxism–Leninism and physical labor. This resolution was followed by suspension of the publication of Van indefinitely and assigned artists and cultural cadres to a three-stage \\"struggle class\\" that involved re-education, ideological struggle, and hard labor. A re-education course was organized for nearly 500 writers and artists in January 1958, and from March to April 1958 the LDP Central Committee's Subcommittee for Arts and Letters organized a \\"study session\\" for some 304 writers, poets, and other cultural cadres, each of whom was forced to make a \\"self-criticism.\\" In the end, four dissenters were expelled from the Union of Arts and Literature and others, such as poets Tran Dan and Le Dat, were suspended. And 300 of the 476 people reeducated in the same year were writers and artists. Arrests On October 21–23, 1956, a delegation composed of 40 writers and artists discussed the questions of intellectual freedom with such prominent party cadres as Trường Chinh, Xuân Thủy, and Tố Hữu. Of the intellectuals present, the young poet Lê Đạt expressed particularly sharp criticism of the regime's intolerant cultural policies in general, and of To Huu and Hoai Thanh in particular. Among others, he condemned the imprisonment of the poet Trần Dần, and the harassment to which Văn Cao, a famous poet and composer, had been subjected. On the second day, it was the artists' turn to speak. On the third day, Truong Chinh declared that the intellectuals' complaints were justified, but he instructed the participants not to publish anything about the debate in the press. The Hungarian revolution of October 23 (and particularly the Soviet invasion of November 4) put an end to North Vietnam's short-lived intellectual \\"thaw\\". The editors of Nhan Van intended to publish a special issue about the Hungarian events, whereupon the authorities banned the paper, and adopted a tougher attitude toward intellectual dissidence.Balázs Szalontai, Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955-56. Cold War History, Vol. 5, Issue 4 (November 2005), pp. 395-426. Downloadable at https://www.academia.edu/6097481/Political_and_Economic_Crisis_in_North_Vietnam_1955_-_56 . On December 15, 1956, the Communist Party, having hesitated for two years, finally shut down the organization, closed the office, and arrested key participants. Some were imprisoned and others sent to re-education camp (Vietnamese: trại học tập cải tạo) and others made to undertake self- criticism.Vietnam: the politics of bureaucratic socialism - Page 165 Gareth Porter - 1993 \\"After hesitating for two years to act forcefully, the party closed Nhan Van in 1958, arrested the key group that published it, and compelled hundreds of writers, artists, and intellectuals to take a re- education course and undertake self-criticism regarding their \\"bourgeois viewpoints. \\" The event was publicised by Trăm Hoa Đua Nở Trên Đất Bắc (Hundreds of Flowers Blooming in the North), published in 1959 by the Congress of Cultural Freedom in Saigon, and in the West by Hoàng Văn Chí in The New Class in North Vietnam (Saigon, 1964). Rehabilitation After the Doi Moi reforms in the late 1980s, many of the imprisoned intellectuals were rehabilitated. The government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam recognized many of the writers and poets in the late 1990s and 2000s (decade) with many state awards, often posthumously.  Significance  Nhan Van-Giai Pham affair was seems like an interlude of North Vietnamese political history, which did not last so long, but its legacy still impact on current Vietnamese society. It was the first and most formative event in political dissidence under the VCP's rule, and the issues raised by dissidents in the 1950s remain unchanged. First, Nhan Van Giai Pham is a reference point for those who want political reform, the restoration of intra-party democratization, and greater intellectual freedom. Secondly, although Nhan Van Giai Pham is still sensitive to present Hanoi, it could not be neglect because it continues as a rallying point for those who demand the party reopen the matter and rehabilitate the victims. Third, this affair also can be a bridge for the new generation of artists and intellectuals to link to their predecessors\` past. Finally, how the regime responds to this event, even today, tells much about the state of political reform in Vietnam.  Different Interpretations  = Orthodox point of view = From the orthodox point of view, Zachary Abuza (2001) considered that the intellectuals in Nhan Van Giai Pham were a group of dissidents who were joined the Viet Minh out of patriotism, not a love of communism. Indeed, a South Vietnamese scholar argued that the intellectuals were \\"encouraged by the hope that they might use the resistance organization to assemble nationalist elements and to create a force which would actually tip the scales against the communists within the ranks of the resistance.\\" Therefore, the dissent was originated from two disparate ideologies between the intellectuals and Viet Minh. Another feature of Nhan Van Giai Pham from the orthodox interpretation is its close connection with China. Abuza (2001) stated that both the rectification campaign and the land reform campaign modeled on China, and Chinese logistical support was very necessary to Viet Minh during 1950s. Yinghong Cheng (2004) insists that Nhan Van-Giai Pham\`s connection with China was more obviously than with the Eastern Europe. It was looked upon China as its inspiration, and it went through a saddlelike course which at some points corresponded to the circumstances in China. = Revisionist point of view = Different from the orthodox viewpoint which characterizes Nhan Van Giai Pham as a \\"dissident\\" movement, the revisionist viewpoint suggests that the standard view of Nhan Van-Giai Pham fails to appreciate the \\"reform Communist\\" character of its agenda. Moreover, when examined within a broader transnational context—one marked by the emergence of loosely connected reformist movements throughout the Communist world in the 1950s inspired by de-StalinizationNhan Van Giai Pham comes off as a relatively restrained effort to \\"save\\" Vietnamese Communism by transforming it from within. Peter Zinoman (2001) insisted that the intellectuals were all from late colonial era, during 1950s, some disenchanted intellectuals abandoned Viet Minh and others for the sake of higher career positions in cultural bureaucracy of DRV chose to become \\"true believers\\" to Maoism. Between the rejectionists and the true believers was a much larger group of Viet Minh intellectuals who came to express their disappointment during Nhan Van Giai Pham period. On the other hand, this affair has been highly related to global currents of reform communism after the death of Stalin from mid-1950 by the revisionist historians. Affinities between Nhan Van Giai Pham and Eastern bloc reform Communism may be found in shared patterns of language and argumentation as well as in a common repertoire of political positions and cultural references. In addition, Nhan Van Giai Pham\`s kinship with a moderate version of reform Communism is evident in its leaders\` insistent expression of fidelity to the VWP and Marxism–Leninism. = Other interpretations = Lien- Hang T. Nguyen (2006) stated that neither totally imitated to Chinese models, nor had affinity with Eastern bloc, Viet Minh was actually intertwined with the deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations during 1950s. The North Vietnamese intended to maintain a neutral position under the influences from both China and Soviet Union because it could not afford to alienate either Moscow or Beijing. Nevertheless, since the Vietnamese communists were geographically, culturally and historically closer to the Chinese Communist Party, and since Moscow demonstrated further inclination to avoid a confrontation with the United States after 1954 Geneva Accords, the voices within the VWP calling for a Vietnamese move closer to Beijing in its ideological orientation. Therefore, according to this interpretation, although Nhan Van Giai Pham affair was shaped by the current of de-Stalinization and the Hundred Flowers Movement from eastern bloc and China during 1950s, it still tried to find an independent way to deal with such political struggles.

History In looking for a place to lay out a course, a family named Brower was approached and because the parents had recently died, the daughter liked the idea of the farm becoming a golf course and sold the family farm of to the Golf Corporation, Thomas W. Davis, Pres., for $10,000. Another adjoining were bought for $6,000. $17,000 had already been raised by selling shares for $100 a share, so with $1,000 in the bank, they forged ahead. Tom Davis designed the nine-hole course, and with the help of many volunteers, many of whom belonged to the Glenwood Lions Club, the work began. Two dams were built to supply the water for the greens, the fairways were seeded (1963), and the members of the soon-to-be Ladies League for the course hand planted trees. Opening day was May 30, 1964. Dues the first year were $35.00, and if you belonged within a five-mile (8 km) radius of Glenwood, you could not play without being a member.

When Donnelly played as an international there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland - based IFA and the Irish Free State - based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. Donnelly was one of several players born in Northern Ireland who benefited from the FAI's attempts to establish their all-Ireland influence. He made 2 appearances and scored 1 goal for the FAI XI. Together with fellow Northerner, Mick Hoy, he made his international debut in a 3–2 away defeat to Norway on 10 October 1937, in a qualifier for the 1938 World Cup. Donnelly won his first cap while with Drumcondra and subsequently joined Shamrock Rovers. He made his second appearance for the FAI XI on 18 September 1938 in a friendly against Switzerland and scored the fourth goal in 4–0 win. The other goalscorers that day were Paddy Bradshaw and Connelly's Rovers teammate, Jimmy Dunne. Despite getting on the score sheet against the Swiss, Donnelly later lost his place to Kevin O'Flanagan and was released by Rovers shortly afterwards.

The website was operated by Eel Pie Recording Production, Limited, a company set up in 1970 by Pete Townshend. History The Lifehouse Method grew out of Pete Townshend's ground-breaking 1971 futuristic composition Lifehouse. Although Townshend originally intended Lifehouse as a multi-media, audience-participation musical production to follow The Who's Tommy, difficulties in funding and implementing the project led to its release as The Who's highly successful album Who's Next instead. Although some of the key Lifehouse songs were left off Who's Next, the basic concept of the opus is still recognizable within the album. In Lifehouse Townshend predicted a future wherein the population was forced inside by heavy pollution and connected in their homes to an Internet-like \\"Grid\\" through which media moguls provided programmed entertainment. Rebels escaped this situation and gathered together to perform a live musical concert which generated a nirvana like state of universal unity. Townshend hoped to link the audience in a way that would reflect the personalities of the audience members. To do this, he adapted VCS3 and ARP synthesizers and a quadraphonic PA to create a machine capable of generating and combining personal music themes written from computerized biographical data. He expected these thematic components would merge to form a \\"One Note\\" or \\"universal chord\\" representing the audience, and by extrapolation, all of humanity. Although the original project proved too ambitious for the technology available in 1971, Townshend revisited the Lifehouse concept in The Who's album Who Are You and in his radio play and recording Psychoderelict. He continued discussion of these themes in his later opus The Boy Who Heard Music. This last work somewhat followed the Lifehouse interactive format, starting life as a novella on Townshend's Internet blog site in 2005 and 2006, where he opened an interactive discussion with readers. Material from the novella then went into songs for The Who's album Endless Wire and into a full length rock musical which premiered 13 July 2007, as part of Vassar College's Powerhouse Summer Theater workshop series. Townshend also intended this story to become an animated film. The Lifehouse Method website was discontinued in July 2008, having generated over 10,000 pieces of unique, customized music. http://www.lifehouse-method.com. In January 2012 Method Music by Lawrence Ball, consisting of music created by Ball with assistance from Townshend using the Lifehouse Method, was released by Navona Records.pavementpr.com. The Method The Lifehouse Method is software that will create a musical portrait. The applicants registered at the website and received a password which allowed them to create a composition. The website musical team expected to choose some of these portraits for further development into larger compositions or songs that would be presented in a concert or concert series, with the applicant receiving a portion of any income generated. However, to date no concert has been arranged.

He is the butler and chauffeur to Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and, like her, a field agent of the secret organisation International Rescue. The puppet character of the TV series and first two films was voiced by David Graham. In the live-action film, Parker is portrayed by Ron Cook. Graham reprised his role for the part-computer- animated, part-live-action remake series Thunderbirds Are Go!, which first aired in the UK in 2015. The character is known for his hypercorrected Cockney speech and frequent use of the phrase \\"Yes, M'Lady\\" to acknowledge Penelope's orders. Character biography Parker is employed at Creighton-Ward Mansion by Lady Penelope, serving as her butler and chauffeur (driving FAB 1, a modified, pink Rolls-Royce). Like Penelope, he is an International Rescue field agent. Born in London, Parker speaks with a heavy Cockney accent, although he frequently attempts to speak with Received Pronunciation (most notably for his catchphrase, \\"Yes, M'Lady\\"). Parker is a reformed criminal, having served prison sentences for cat burglary and safe-cracking. His criminal exploits, coupled with a prominent facial feature, earned him the nickname \\"Nosey\\" (this may also be a reference to his nosiness – he eavesdrops on his employer's conversations in \\"Vault of Death\\" and Thunderbird 6). He was rescued from a life of crime by Penelope, who recruited him as an aide in her espionage activities. Parker's underworld contacts frequently prove useful during the pair's missions (such as in \\"The Cham-Cham\\", when he blackmails a talent agent to have an undercover Penelope pass off as a nightclub singer). It is revealed in \\"The Cham-Cham\\" that Parker suffers from vertigo. In the episode \\"The Man from MI.5\\" it is revealed he still has the temptation to return to his burglar ways as he was caught with a suitcase full of safecracking equipment, much to Penelope's chagrin. He later complained to himself about the situation, saying \\"'Ow she expects me to keep my 'and in I don't know\\". He is very \\"old school\\" in the ways of safecracking, as the equipment consisted of a brick, various wrenches, a bit and brace etc. In \\"Vault of Death\\" he is shown to use a stethoscope instead of a modern detector. He stated that it was good enough for his father, his grandfather and his great-grandfather. This implies that cat burglary and safecracking were a family business and probably explains where he got his skills. In the same episode it is revealed Parker knew a fellow burglar nicknamed \\"light- fingered Fred\\" when he was in prison and he further claimed that Fred was the only one who could possibly rival him in the skills of his criminal expertise. It is revealed in the episode \\"Danger at Ocean Deep\\" that Parker has an upper- class connoisseur-like taste for fine beverages as he manages to pilfer a bottle of vintage 1998 champagne, right under Penelope's nose no less, and swap it with pure tonic water without her knowing anything. During the launching of the ship he and another fellow chauffeur, a friend named Stevens, share in drinking the entire bottle together. Penelope later finds Parker asleep and hiccupping. A slurring Parker then (drunkenly) reveals his theft. He says he did this on the grounds that it was such a good year it seemed a shame to see it go to waste. =Appearances= *\\"Trapped in the Sky\\" *\\"The Perils of Penelope\\" *\\"Day of Disaster\\" *\\"30 Minutes After Noon\\" *\\"Vault of Death\\" *\\"The Mighty Atom\\" *\\"The Impostors\\" *\\"The Man From MI.5\\" *\\"Danger at Ocean Deep\\" *\\"The Duchess Assignment\\" *\\"Brink of Disaster\\" *\\"The Cham-Cham\\" *\\"Atlantic Inferno\\" *\\"Path of Destruction\\" *\\"Alias Mr. Hackenbacker\\" *\\"Lord Parker's 'Oliday\\" *Thunderbirds Are Go *Thunderbird 6 *Thunderbirds *Thunderbirds Are Go! Background Although Lady Penelope and Parker were among the first characters to be developed, neither was conceived as a central character.Anderson 2007, p. 30. The inspiration for Parker came from director David Elliott, who had been reading a spy novel about a safecracker who unwittingly becomes a government agent.La Rivière, p. 107. The character's Cockney speech (dubbed \\"Parkerese\\" by Graham and series creator Gerry Anderson) was based on the voice of a wine waiter at the Kings Arms in Cookham, Berkshire, which was regularly visited by members of the crew.Marriott 1993, p. 122. Anderson said that Arthur, who was once in the service of Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, spoke with a \\"warm patter, dropping his 'aitches' and putting them back in the wrong places, and this intrigued me ... I thought [his] voice would be perfect.\\"Archer and Hearn, p. 116. He therefore had Graham dine at the establishment to learn the style. Anderson did not inform Arthur of his contribution to Parker's characterisation, worried that he would dislike the public recognition that it might bring if it became widely known.Marriott 1993, p. 124.La Rivière, p. 108. The look of the character was based mainly on comedian Ben Warriss, a member of the Crazy Gang.Anderson 2007, p. 49. John Blundall, who sculpted the puppet, also drew inspiration from Miles Malleson, Ronald Shiner and \\"typical, clichéd butlers in black-and-white English comedy films\\". Blundall said that he \\"made Parker look so unlike the other puppets just to be bloody-minded, because I wanted to prove that to produce really strong characters in puppets, you need to stylise them and find two or three characteristics to combine and communicate with.\\"Archer and Hearn, p. 113. In the 2004 live-action film, in which Parker is played by Ron Cook, the character retains his Cockney accent but no longer hypercorrects his words. In an interview, Cook explained that \\"we thought his tendency to talk posh wasn't really relevant to this day and age.\\" Reception and influence Acknowledging Parker's role as a peripheral comic foil, as well as the heavy caricature of the original puppet character, David Garland likens him to the Victorian-era stock character Pantaloon, \\"a low, comic figure that functioned as a butt of jokes, and did not mix with regular dramatic characters.\\" Series co-creator Sylvia Anderson described Parker as a \\"lovable rogue with doubtful connections who had gone straight.\\" While speaking as a guest on BBC 6 Music in December 2007, she cast doubt on the assertion that the character's first name was Aloysius, stating that he was \\"only ever 'Nosey' Parker\\". The puppet character is known for his Cockney speech, which he would often hypercorrect by adding non-standard aitches in an attempt to imitate prestigious English. He is also remembered for his frequent use of the expression \\"Yes, M'Lady\\" in acknowledging Penelope's instructions. Commentators Jim Sangster and Paul Condon write that the character's \\"adenoidal\\" delivery of this line \\"became synonymous with the show.\\" They also describe Penelope and Parker as the \\"best characters in the Anderson collection\\", stating that the duo \\"managed to steal every episode they appeared in.\\" In 2003 Virgin Trains West Coast named locomotive 57311 Parker.Brush Class 57/3 Thunderbird locomotives Entrain issue 19 July 2003 page 22 It retained the name when sold to Direct Rail Services in 2013.Remaining Class 57/3s snapped up by DRS and West Coast Co The Railway Magazine issue 1343 March 2013 page 80 References =Works cited=   *Thunderbirds DVD Box Set (9-Disc).

It recounts the sinking of the USS Indianapolis. The show initially aired on July 29, 2007, on the eve of the anniversary of the ship’s sinking in 1945. The show investigated the shark attacks that occurred when the USS Indianapolis sank. Hundreds of crew that survived were stranded in the water for four days before rescue. In that time many of the survivors endured constant shark attacks. The Discovery Channel hired George H. Burgess, a renowned investigator in shark attacks, to determine, \\"why the sharks attacked the way they did,\\" and to \\"investigate the survival strategies of the men in the water, including those who fought the sharks.\\" Cast and crew The cast and crew of Ocean of Fear included these people: * Richard Bedser, Director * Peter Miller, Editor * Malcolm Mclean, Director of Photography * Charlotte Wheaton, Line Producer * Richard Dreyfuss, Narrator.

Of the estimated 900 men who survived the attack, only 317 were rescued after four days in shark infested waters. The Discovery Channel describes the event as \\"the worst shark attack in history.\\" Surviving members of the crew attended a special screening in New York City on 18 July 2007. According to the accounts of the surviving crew, most of the men died of either exhaustion, exposure to the elements, or drinking the ocean water, not from shark attacks.

History KSTL was formerly located on the historic Laclede's Landing in downtown Saint Louis, but later moved to the Saint Louis suburbs, currently broadcasting out of the same building as KYFI. KSTL originally played only music, as its sister station KYFI (then KJSL) had the only studio when KSTL began. KSTL expanded its format beyond Christian music and into talk radio and ministries in 1995 and shared a studio with KJSL, eventually landing its own separate studio. Programming KSTL is one of 12 religious radio stations licensed to St. Louis and its metro area, according to the St. Louis Journalism review study in March 2000. KSTL is not specifically geared towards one specific religion. KSTL airs more than 120 top-rated National and Local programs throughout its schedule. The programs are primarily Christian teaching and preaching, along with traditional and Contemporary Christian music and Public affairs programming.

It is also the title of Dixon's autobiography, edited by Don Snowden. The album features songs written by Dixon and originally performed by other artists for Chess Records.  Original performances  Four of the nine songs on I Am the Blues – \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"Spoonful\\", \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\", \\"The Little Red Rooster\\" – were originally performed by Howlin' Wolf. \\"Back Door Man\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" were recorded by Howlin' Wolf in June 1960 featuring bass work by Willie Dixon, piano work by Otis Spann, drum work by Fred Below, and guitar work by Hubert Sumlin. \\"The Little Red Rooster\\" was recorded in June 1961 with guitar work by Howlin' Wolf and Hubert Sumlin, piano work by Johnny Jones, bass work by Dixon, and drum work by Sam Lay. \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" was recorded in December 1961 with Howlin' Wolf, Hubert Sumlin, and Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Henry Gray on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Sam Lay on drums. The songs \\"You Shook Me\\" and \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\\" were first recorded by Muddy Waters. \\"I'm You Hoochie Coochie Man\\" was recorded on January 7, 1954 with Waters on vocals and guitar, Little Walter on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Otis Spann on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Fred Below on drums. \\"You Shook Me\\" was recorded on June 27, 1962. \\"The Seventh Son\\" was recorded by Willie Mabon in 1955. \\"I Can't Quit You, Baby\\" was not even released on Chess Records; instead it was recorded and released by Otis Rush on the Cobra record label.  Reception  The Allmusic review of the album by Bruce Eder has the opinion that the production on the album was well done, but that the original performances were still better. Robert Christgau feels that Dixon's singing ability on the album is not as good as it could be, because he doesn't need to be a good singer since he's a good composer and producer.

Background  The British force consisted of the light cruisers , and with the destroyers and . The squadron was under the command of Rear Admiral C. H. J. Harcourt. On the night of 2 December, they found and attacked an Italian convoy and its escort bound for Tunisia. The convoy consisted of three destroyers and two torpedo boats: the German KT-1 (850 tons), Aventino (3,794 t), Puccini (2,422 t), and Aspromonte (an armed ferry-boat, 976 tons). The ships were carrying reinforcements for General Rommel's Africa Korps. It included 1,766 troops, 698 tons of cargo (mainly ammunition), 4 tanks, 32 other vehicles and 12 artillery pieces. The escort was composed of the destroyers (flagship), Camicia Nera, Folgore and the torpedo boats Clio and Procione which were commanded by Captain Aldo Cocchia.  Battle  The British ships opened fire and destroyed all the cargo and troop ships. The escort ships were hit as well, with Folgore fatally damaged (nine 133 mm direct hits) by cruisers, and later sunk with 120 dead (among them, commander Ener Bettica), Nicoloso da Recco badly damaged (an explosion of the forward 120 mm ammunition magazines put her out of commission until June 1943) with 118 dead. Camicia Nera launched all her 6 torpedoes, which missed their targets. HMS Sirius escaped with no damage despite Camicia Nera firing on her from only , dodging several torpedoes and continued cooperating in the sinking of the Axis convoy.  Aftermath  At dawn, the short-range engagement saw a clear British victory, while the Axis suffered no fewer than 2,000 casualties (probably 2,037 or even 2,200, the total is uncertain) and lost five ships, with Puccini still afloat, but to later sink. Whilst they were withdrawing Savoias attacked Q-Force, without result but losing some aircraft. Spitfires claimed four Sparvieros with one loss, while HMS Quentin was sunk with 20 dead by a 500 kg bomb released from a Junkers Ju 88 (the hit scored may have been a torpedo). On the other side, the human losses were 124 from Folgore, 118 from Nicoloso da Recco, 39 from Aspromonte, 3 from Procione, 200 civil/militarized crew and 1,527 troops, all in Aventino and Puccini.Sgarlato, Nico: Lo scontro del banco di Skerki, Eserciti nella Storia magazine, Delta editions, Parma, gen-feb-2012, p.23-25  External links  * Convoy Battle near Skerki Bank  References  Category:1942 in Italy Category:Allied naval victories in the battle of the Mediterranean Category:Mediterranean convoys of World War II B Category:December 1942 events ","title":"Battle of Skerki Bank"},{"id":"12243615","title":"Wil Traval"},{"id":"12243627","title":"2003 Texas Rangers season"},{"id":"12243648","title":"2002 Texas Rangers season"},{"id":"12243655","title":"Virginia Gay"},{"id":"12243657","text":"Allison Cratchley (2011) Allison Cratchley (born 1975) is an Australian actress.

It organizes Volunteer Playmakers to spend time with children in wards or in special play areas, taking its name from the radio stations it runs in hospitals playing children's programming - part-presented by children themselves. History Radio Lollipop was founded in 1978 at Queen Mary's Hospital for Children in Surrey, England, at first primarily as a cable wired radio station for the 460 children in the hospital. The station made its first broadcast on 5 May 1979, when the very first Radio Lollipop went on-air. Following the success of this first station in 1980 the International Year of the Child Committee provided funding to develop Radio Lollipops in other British hospitals. Over time emphasis shifted from the radio station to volunteers spending time on wards entertaining children in person, by playing games, doing arts and crafts and reading stories. However the \\"radio\\", with children's programming and often presenting on-air, remains a central part of the charity. Programming consists of on-air Presenter-banter with children, interspersed with request songs, and comedy and competitions. In most hospitals the programme is wired to speakers in wards, rather than actually broadcast, however a central studio, with on- air Presenters, open to children provides a focal point and base. There is a project under-way to carry feed from other hospitals in different time zones throughout the day, via the internet. Radio Lollipop is run entirely by unpaid volunteers, (usually a mix of city business people, retirees and medical students), and usually operates in the evenings. In 1985 the first Radio Lollipop outside the UK was started in Perth, Western Australia, at the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children. From these beginnings the organisation has expanded to hospitals in the east coast of Australia, New Zealand and America. Radio Lollipop is in one of the largest and most famous specialist children referral hospitals in the world, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, where it provides play services to children in 390 beds on 21 wards. It originally broadcast radio from and held play sessions in a former Jubilee line tube train that was craned into the hospital and converted to house the Radio Lollipop studio.

The Korean War was important in the development of the Cold War, as it showed that the two superpowers, United States and Soviet Union, could fight a \\"limited war\\" in a third country. The \\"limited war\\" or \\"proxy war\\" strategy was a feature of conflicts such as the Vietnam War and the Soviet War in Afghanistan, as well as Angola, Greece, and wars in the Middle East. The Korean War was the first war in which the United Nations (UN) participated in outside the Western World. Some commentators argued that it showed that the UN was a powerful organization for helping to keep world peace. The UN Command in South Korea is still functional. Around June 1950, the Korean War became an international crisis as it made communist and capitalist countries around the world go against each other. By the end of WWII the Soviet Union or USSR sought to spread communism to other nations. They did this by providing political, logistical, and diplomatic support, and assisted in the plans to invade South Korea. The USSR also provided military training for North Korean and Chinese allied troops. In Response the United States fearing Russia would control and spread communism to the entire peninsula and the south pacific, sent troops into South Korea to support the Republic of Korea's military forces. These actions quickly escalated into other countries from the United Nations (UN) supporting the south, and China supporting the north to get involved in the conflict. The war devastated both North and South Korea. Both fronts suffered major damage to their economies and infrastructure, as a result of bombings, artillery strikes and loss of life to include military personnel and civilians. In the aftermath of the war, the United States funneled significant aid to South Korea under the auspices of the United Nations Korea Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA). Concomitantly, North Korean reconstruction was assisted by \\"fraternal socialist nations,\\" namely the USSR and China. In the years immediately following the war, North Korea's growth rate of total industrial output exceeded that of South Korea, averaging 39% between 1953 and 1960. Australia  From 1950 to 1953, 17,000 Australians in the Army, Navy and Air Force fought as part of the United Nations multinational forces. Australian troops participated in two major battles in 1951. The first, on April 22, 1951, Chinese forces attacked the Kapyong valley and forced South Korean and Australian troops into retreat; other UN troops, including the Australian, were ordered to halt the attack. After a night of fierce fighting, during which the allied positions were overrun, the Australians counterattacked and recaptured their positions, stalling the Chinese advance. The Australians suffered very few casualties. For their contribution to this action, 3 RAR (Royal Australian Regiment) was awarded a U.S. Presidential Citation. Australian soldiers also participated in Operation Commando, an attack against a Chinese-held position in a bend of the Imjin River, a river running north–south that crosses the 38th parallel north just above Seoul. The attack began on October 3, 1951, and after five days of heavy fighting the Chinese withdrew. Twenty Australians were killed in the battle and 89 were wounded. As the war continued, several other nations grew less willing to contribute more ground troops. Australia, however, increased its troop strength in Korea.\\"Korean War 1950–53\\" . Australian War Memorial After the war ended, Australians remained in Korea for four years as military observers. Australia gained political and security benefits, the most significant being the signing of the ANZUS Treaty with the United States and New Zealand. Canada Memorial in Ottawa Canada sent 29,791 troops to the war, with 7,000 more remaining to supervise the ceasefire until the end of 1955. Of these 1,558 became casualties, including 516 deaths, most of them through combat.\\"Canadians in Korea, 1950–1953\\" . Korean-War.com, Accessed 23 June 2006. Canada's participation included a brigade of troops, eight naval vessels, and 22 pilots for U.S. jet squadrons. The first Canadian aid to the UN forces came from the Royal Canadian Navy. On July 12, 1950, three Canadian destroyers, HMCS Cayuga, HMCS Athabaskan and , were sent to Korea to serve under United Nations Command. These ships supported the assault at Inchon and played an especially important role in the evacuation. Canadian ships also kept up the blockade on North Korean waters and protected coastal villages from attack. The Canadian army also helped UN forces repulse and defend major positions from Chinese attack. The Korean War was the last major conflict Canadian forces participated in until the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and the last major combat by ground troops until 2002 in Afghanistan. Canada played a minor role in the fighting in Cyprus in 1974 and in the Balkans at Medak Pocket in the 1990s. The Canadian military was revitalized as a result of the Korean War. A changeover to U.S.-designed weapons and equipment had been planned for the 1950s, but the emergency in Korea forced the use of war stocks of British- designed weapons from World War II. In the late 1950s, Canada adopted a variety of weapons. Colombia Being the only Latin American country to participate in the conflict, Colombia provided ground and naval support to South Korea. Under their newly elected president Laureano Gomez sought greater economic relations with the United States to ease previous tensions of anti-U.S. sentiments during WWII. The first Battalion was an all volunteer force of over 1000 personnel in June 1951 and approximately 5000 sailors and soldiers provided assistance between 1951-1954 to include Columbia's only frigate at the time, the Almirante. France At a time of political difficulties due to lack of cabinet members and a prime minister, the French government eventually provided military support to South Korea by sending over the French Army's Battalion Francis De 1'Onu of over 3000 soldiers and sailors. This Battalion played a significant role in defending the 38th parallel on the Korean Peninsula and the South Korean Capitol City Seoul between 1950 and 1954. The French at the time were worried that if they failed in their efforts it would harm future relations between them, Indochina and the UN. Greece Almost 5000 troops from the Greece Expeditionary Force, from its air force and army, were provided in response to the UN's appeal for more assistance at the beginning of the Korean War. It would seem strange that such a small country with insignificant ties with South Korea would provide such a large amount of support during the war. However, Greece had international sympathy for Korea due to its own history of a civil war against communism. Another reason why Greece sent a large amount troops was because of a long rivalry with Turkey as Greece also sought to improve relations with the UN and the United States. India During this time India was newly independent from British rule and viewed the Korean conflict as a motivation and also a threat. During the cold war New Delhi became more concerned of India's well-being due to the spread of communism and the constant support of the USSR and China to North Korea. These events could lead to communist influence getting to India. India took action in the form of medical supplies, personnel, and a custodian force used to look after enemy prisoners of war (EPOW's) Due to the nature of the conflict and it's nuclear capabilities India decided to play a more conservative role in assisting the rest of the UN and South Korea. India also contributed in containing the war and not allowing it to escalate by working alongside the UN Security Council resolutions to provide a status quo to avoid prolonged conflict. India also supported the UN Security Council in the avocation of the power of unity among the major powers to work together towards a solution of the conflict. Japan As American occupation armies were dispatched to Korean peninsula, Japan's security became problematic. Under United States guidance, Japan established Reserved Police, later the Japan Self-Defense Forces (自衛隊). The signing of the Treaty of Peace with Japan (日本国との平和条約; popularly known as the Treaty of San Francisco) was also hastened to return Japan back into international communities. In the eyes of some American policy makers, the non-belligerency clause in the Constitution was already being considered a \\"mistake\\" by 1953. Economically, Japan was able to benefit vastly from the war, and the Korean War greatly helped the rise of Japan's economy and its development into a world power. American requirements for supplies were organized through a Special Procurements system, which allowed for local purchases without the complex Pentagon procurement system. Over $3.5 billion was spent on Japanese companies, peaking at $809 million in 1953, and the zaibatsu went from being distrusted to being encouraged. Among those who thrived not only on orders from the military but also through American industrial experts, including W. Edwards Deming were Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo. Japanese manufacturing grew by 50% between March 1950 and 1951, and by 1952, pre-war standards of living were reached and output was twice the level of 1949. Becoming an independent country after the Treaty of San Francisco saved Japan from the burden of expense of the occupation forces. During the war, 200,000 to 400,000 Koreans fled to Japan relying on relatives already living in Japan to provide them with shelters and necessary paperwork to live legally. They joined with those having fled from Jeju and formed the largest post-World War II Korean population group in Japan. While they initially had no strong political alignment, they were eventually split into factions supporting either North or South Korea with few holding on to the ideal of unified Korea.  People's Republic of China  Peng Dehuai toasting Kim Il-sung in 1955 The PRC had sent some of its best units to join the war. Although the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had some initial success, losses (both on the battlefield as well as in material and casualties) exposed the PLA's weaknesses in firepower, air support, logistics, and communication. As a result, the PLA was given a new mandate to modernize and professionalize itself. This ran counter to the PLA's previous mandate that put dogma before expertise and modernization. The commander of the PLA's forces in Korea during the war, marshal Peng Dehuai, was made the government's first minister of defense to implement the changes and reforms such as modernization of weaponry, training and discipline, the rank system, and conscription. China successfully prevented the South Korean and U.S. militaries from establishing a presence on its Manchurian border. At that time, Manchuria, especially Liaoning – the Chinese province north of the Yalu River – was China's most important industrial center. Protecting the Manchurian industrial zone was one of the major reasons China entered the war. Furthermore, by supporting the North Korean state, China obtained more than 300 km of strategic buffer zone from the U.S. which would avoid the military spending necessary to protect its Korean border for the next fifty years. On the other hand, this meant China lost the opportunity to reunify Taiwan. Initially, the United States had abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to Beijing anyway, so the basic U.S. policy was to \\"wait and see\\" on the assumption that Taiwan's fall to Communist China was inevitable. However, the North Korean invasion of South Korea, in the context of the Cold War, meant U.S. President Truman intervened again and dispatched the Seventh Fleet to \\"neutralize\\" the Formosa (Taiwan) Strait.Stanford University: Taiwanese Cultural Society – 歷史 History , accessed 19 October 2010 During the war, over an estimate number of 21,800 Chinese troops were taken prisoner by the Allies. After the war, they were given a chance to return to the People's Republic of China or to go to the Republic of China (Taiwan). Over two thirds of the entire group chose to go to Taiwan for the fears of government reprisal, consequently defecting to the Army of the Republic of China. The war also partly contributed to the decline of Sino-Soviet relations. Although the Chinese had their own reasons to enter the war, mentioned above, the view that the Soviets had used them as proxies was shared by the Western bloc. MacArthur was a notable exception, dissenting from this prevailing view in his \\"Old Soldiers Never Die\\" speech. China had to use a Soviet loan, which had been originally intended to rebuild their destroyed economy, to pay for Soviet arms. From official Chinese sources, PVA Korean War casualty figures break down as follows: 114,084 killed in action; 380,000 total wounded in action; 70,000 died of wounds or sickness; and 25,621 missing.\\"180,000 Chinese soldiers killed in Korean War, says Chinese general\\" .

State Council Information Office, Chinese government, Beijing. \\"According to statistics compiled by the army's medical departments and hospitals, 114,084 servicemen were killed in military action or accidents, and 25,621 soldiers had gone missing. The other about 70,000 casualties died from wounds, illness and other causes, he said. To date, civil affairs departments have registered 183,108 war martyrs, Xu said.\\"  Republic of China (Taiwan)  Korea played an important role in sustaining the ROC's economic stability. Until the war in Korea, the U.S. had largely abandoned the Nationalist government of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, whose forces had retreated to Taiwan after their defeat at the hands of Mao Zedong's Communists in the Chinese Civil War. Indeed, the U.S. had little involvement in that conflict, beyond supplying surplus material to the Nationalists. However, the PRC's involvement in the Korean War rendered any U.S. policy that would have allowed Taiwan to fall under PRC control untenable. This saw the abandonment of the American policy to let Taiwan join the communist Chinese state, the policy which existed prior to the war. Truman's decision to send American warships to the Formosa Strait as well as an increase in aid in order to deter the PRC from making any attempt to invade Taiwan, after doing nothing to prevent the Nationalist's mainland defeat in the first place, is evidence of this. Also, the anti-communist atmosphere in the West in response to the Korean War contributed to the unwillingness to diplomatically recognize the People's Republic of China until the 1970s. In that time, the Republic of China (ROC) was recognized by the U.S. as 'the' legitimate Chinese government, and that in turn allowed Taiwan to develop politically, militarily, and economically. The result has been that, today, any effort by the PRC to invade the island, or otherwise coerce the people there into an arrangement of political unity with the Communist controlled mainland, would be difficult at best to accomplish, and may be impossible without a great deal of bloodshed. While economic ties between the PRC and ROC have grown immensely since the 1990s, thus achieving a degree of interdependency that would have been unimaginable even twenty years ago; political diplomacy between the ROC and mainland China remains strained, and successive governments in Taiwan have consistently, if sometimes obliquely, signaled their determination to remain independent for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the defectors arrived in Taiwan on January 23, 1954, and were immediately celebrated as \\"Anti-Communist volunteers\\". The ROC government soon declared January 23 as World Freedom Day in their honor.Monique Chu, NGO celebrates World Freedom Day , Taipei Times, February 3, 2002  Soviet Union  The war was a political disaster for the Soviet Union. Its central objective, the unification of the Korean peninsula under the Kim Il-Sung regime, was not achieved. Boundaries of both parts of Korea remained practically unchanged. Furthermore, relations with communist ally China were seriously and permanently spoiled, leading to the Sino-Soviet split that lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The United States' strong resistance to the invasion may have prevented a Soviet intervention in Yugoslavia during the Tito-Stalin split. The war, meanwhile, united the countries within the capitalist bloc: the Korean War accelerated the conclusion of a peace agreement between the U.S. and Japan, the warming of West Germany's relations with other western countries, creation of military and political blocs ANZUS (1951) and SEATO (1954). However, because of the war, the authority of the Soviet State grew, which showed in its readiness to interfere in developing countries of the Third World, many of which after the Korean war went down the socialist path of development, after selecting the Soviet Union as their patron. It is generally assumed that the war was a heavy burden on the national economy of the Soviet Union, which was still suffering from the effects of World War II. Expenditures for defense certainly grew more sharply than they otherwise would have. However, it has been claimed that in fact much of the payment for the Soviet contribution to the war effort was made by China (which perhaps goes some way towards explaining the eventual split between the two countries). Also, some historians believe, instead of an obvious political disaster, the war actually may have served to preserve the military power of the Soviet Union, while western forces became relatively broken. Despite the expenses and regardless of who paid them, it must also be said that the Korean War provided approximately thirty thousand Soviet military personnel valuable experience in waging local wars. The conflict also allowed the Soviets the opportunity to test several new forms of armament, in particular the MiG-15 combat aircraft. Furthermore, numerous models of American military equipment were captured, which made it possible for Soviet engineers and scientists to reverse engineer American technology, and use what they learned for the development of new forms of their own armaments. According to declassified Soviet documents released after the fall of the USSR, Stalin himself may have been the main obstacle for peace in Korea specifically because of the intelligence gathered on the American war machine, and the testing of new Soviet military equipment during the conflict.Lashmar, Paul, \\"Stalin's 'Hot' War,\\"  Turkey  During World War II, Turkey maintained a neutral stance. It was decided by the Allies at the Second Cairo Conference that maintaining Turkey's neutrality would serve their interests, by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. Unfortunately, and although Turkey eventually declared war on the Axis Powers in 1945, this decision had the side-effect of leaving the country somewhat isolated in the diplomatic arena after the war. By the beginning of the 1950s, Turkey was under pressure from the Soviet Union on territorial issues, particularly regarding the control of the Turkish Straits. Looking for an ally against the Soviets, Turkey sought to join the NATO alliance, and the Korean War was viewed as an opportunity to show Turkey's good intention. Turkey was one of the larger participants in the U.N. alliance, committing nearly 5,500 troops. The Turkish Brigade, which operated under the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, assisted in protecting the supply lines of U.N. forces which advanced towards North Korea. However, it was the Battles of Kunu-ri and Kumyanjangni that earned the Turkish Brigade a reputation and the praise of U.N. forces. Because of their actions in these battles (721 KIA, 168 MIA, and 2111 WIA), a monument was created in Seoul in the memory of the Turkish soldiers who fought in Korea. Yet Turkey's involvement in the Korean War was a controversial topic in Turkey at the time, and continues to be so today. First, while sending troops to Korea earned Turkey the respect of the West, it was also the beginning of more overt clashes with the Eastern Bloc. Second, the Prime Minister of Turkey Adnan Menderes was criticized for sending troops without asking the parliament first. Last, while Turkey's performance in the Korean War is considered by many citizens as one of the most noble episodes of the country's recent history, some also believe that sending the country's soldiers to die for the interests of the \\"imperialist powers\\" was one of the most misguided foreign policy decisions ever made by the Turkish Republic. Nevertheless, Turkey's entrance into the war as part of the U.N. command did indeed have a great impact on earning a place in NATO. Thus, Turkey can be considered a country which benefited from the Korean War. United Kingdom Approximately 100,000 British troops fought in the Korean war. Their significant involvement was the Battle of the Imjin River against Chinese soldiers. 600 soldiers of the British Army combated a force of 30,000 Chinese troops crossing the Imjin River in Korea in 1951. At the end of the battle 10,000 Chinese troops had fallen. The U.K. only suffered about 59 casualties. This battle was a turning point in the war as it stopped the Chinese advance. The Gloucester Valley Battle Monument is a memorial for British soldiers killed at Solma-Ri, South Korea. 1,078 British soldiers died fighting in the Korean war.  United States  The first American war dead were brought home aboard the USNS Randall, shown here departing Yokohama on March 23, 1953. The Defense Department estimated that the United States spent (equivalent to $B in ) on the Korean War. The American defense budget had nearly quadrupled during this period, and high levels of expenditures were even maintained after 1953. President Truman declared a state of national emergency at the outset of the war in December 1950 during which the penalties under numerous federal statutes were automatically escalated. Although the emergency has long since abated, the federal courts have continued to enforce those penalties into the 21st century for acts that occurred while the emergency was at its height.Espinoza-Castro v. I.N.S., 242 F.3d 1181, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001) Racial integration efforts in the U.S. military began during the Korean War, where African Americans fought in integrated units for the first time. President Truman signed Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1948, calling on the armed forces to provide equal treatment and opportunity for black servicemen. The extent to which Truman's 1948 orders were carried out varied among the various branches of the military, with segregated units still in deployment at the start of the war, and eventually being integrated towards the end of the war. The last large segregated operational unit was the U.S. 24th Infantry Regiment which was deactivated on October 1, 1951. There has been some confusion over the previously reported number of 54,589 Korean War deaths. In 1993, this number was divided by the Defense Department into 33,686 battle deaths, 2,830 non-battle deaths, and 17,730 deaths of Defense Department personnel outside the Korean theatre.Kathleen T. Rhem, Korean War Death Stats Highlight Modern DoD Safety Record , June 8, 2000 There were also 8,142 U.S. personnel listed as Missing In Action (MIA) during the war. U.S. casualties in the war are fewer than in the Vietnam War, but they occurred over three years as opposed to 15 years (1960 to 1975) in Vietnam. However, advances in medical services such as the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital and the use of rapid transport of the wounded to them such as with helicopters led to a lower death rate for U.N. forces than in previous wars. For service during the Korean War, the U.S. military issued the Korean Service Medal. However, many still-living Korean War veterans claim that their country tends to neglect the remembrance of this war. With more overt displays made for World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq war, the Korean War has come to be dubbed by some as the \\"Forgotten war\\" or the \\"Unknown War.\\" As a partial remedy, the Korean War Veterans Memorial was built in Washington, D.C., and dedicated to veterans of the war on July 27, 1995. The U.S. still maintains a heavy military presence in Korea, as part of the effort to uphold the Korean Armistice Agreement between South and North Korea. A special service decoration, known as the Korea Defense Service Medal, is authorized for U.S. service members who today serve a tour of duty in Korea.  Western Europe  The outbreak of the war convinced Western leaders of the growing threat of international communism. The United States began to encourage Western European countries, including West Germany, to contribute to their own defense, though this was perceived as a threat by its neighbors, especially France. West Germany had not fought in the Korean war, as it had been demilitarized. As the war continued, however, opposition to rearmament lessened and China's entry in the war caused France to revise its position towards Bundeswehr German rearmament. To contain the situation French officials proposed the creation of the European Defense Community (EDC), a supranational organization, under the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The end of the war reduced the perceived communist threat, and thus reduced the necessity of such an organization. The French Parliament postponed the ratification of the EDC Treaty indefinitely. This rejection in the French Parliament was caused by Gaullist fears that the creation of the EDC threatened France's national sovereignty. The EDC was not ratified, and the initiative collapsed in August 1955.

At what was called the Synapian Convention held in February, 1806, the members of Philomathic voted to split into two separate societies, one of which became known as Clariosophic, while the other society became known as Euphradian. Two blood brothers picked the members for the new groups in a manner similar to choosing up sides for an impromptu baseball game. John Goodwin became the first president of Clariosophic.

Somewhere along the way, the giving of keys ceased but the key still appeared on the diplomas, The key was shaped like a rhombus or lozenge except that the sides did not meet at the top and bottom, but were blunted off. The front had two overlapping hearts at the top with the Greek letters, Mu Sigma Phi (ΜΣΦ) in the center and the initials C.S., for Clariosophic Society, at the bottom. The reverse side had the two hearts at the top and two Greek words beginning with the letters, Delta and Phi (ΔΦ) in the center and the initials S.C.C, for South Carolina College, at the bottom.

Produced by Varma and Ronnie Screwvala, it was released in India on 3 June 2005. It is the third film in the Gangster film series. The film is a sequel to Varma's 2002 film Company. Like its predecessor, D is based on the real-life Mumbai underworld organization, the D-Company. The three Varma films Satya, Company and D are together considered an Indian Gangster Trilogy. The film features Randeep Hooda in his first lead appearance. The movie became a moderate box office success and marked the comeback of actress Rukhsar Rehman, who was also later seen in Sarkar. Plot Deshu (Randeep Hooda), a mechanic working in Dubai, returns to India after his mother's death in order to console his grieving sister and retired police constable father. Sometime later, Deshu unwittingly becomes the witness to a murder, when the henchmen of a gang led by Mangli, chase and kill a man in front of him. Even though he is aggressively pursued by the police to be a state witness, Deshu chooses not to testify after the gang intimidates and threatens him. Seeking revenge for the harassment, he joins a rival gang, led by Hashim, and ultimately kills Mangli. Due to his bravery and intelligence, Deshu quickly rises up the ranks, becoming the gang's unofficial second-in-command, much to the dismay of Hashim's two sons, Mukarram and Shabbir. Deshu begins a relationship with beautiful Bollywood actress, Bhakti Bhatnagar, after protecting her from sexual harassment by a male colleague, an association which opens him up to connections that go above and beyond the level of the gang. Resentful of his meteoric rise to power and his glamorous relationship, Mukarram and Shabbir begin to plot his demise. They plant the seeds of doubt in Hashim's mind and try to turn their father against his once most trusted member. At the same time, the Mumbai Police have begun to monitor Deshu and assign an Encounter Specialist to the case, in the hopes of bringing him down. Hashim finally relents and allows his sons to carry out an unwarranted attack on Deshu and his friend and partner, Raghav. Raghav and others are killed while Deshu survives; hellbent on revenge. He takes on the gang single-handedly and eliminates those involved in this attempted assassination one by one until he finally kills Mukarram and Shabbir. He intentionally spares the life of Hashim, since he is aware that Hashim has nothing left and will never be able to rebuild his gang again - effectively condemning him to a life of prolonged misery. Deshu, having successfully established himself as a crime lord and managing to evade the police on many occasions, crowns himself the Underworld King, and dreams of forming the \\"D\\" company - an organized crime syndicate which he plans to run like a well-tuned machine from outside India's borders.

After that, it enters the Oklahoma City Metro Area at Canadian County. I-40 and I-44 junction (also known as the Amarillo Junction) traveling westbound in Oklahoma CityI-40 runs through the south side of El Reno as it enters the Oklahoma City metro. It then passes through Yukon before entering Oklahoma City city limits. In west Oklahoma City, I-40 has a junction with Interstate 44. It then runs just south of downtown Oklahoma City on a new ten lane section. I-40 then interlines with Interstate 35 at the Dallas Junction complex. This forms a concurrency with it for two miles (3 km). After the Dallas Junction, I-40 then passes through Del City and Midwest City on the Tinker Diagonal. This provides access to Tinker Air Force Base in east Oklahoma City. In far eastern Oklahoma City, I-40 meets Interstate 240 in a partial junction. Afterwards, it passes through the north side of Shawnee. This marks the eastern end of the OKC metro area. In Henryetta, I-40 serves as the northern terminus of the Indian Nation Turnpike. In McIntosh County, it crosses the northernmost arm of Lake Eufaula. Afterwards, it meets US-69 south of Checotah. Near Webbers Falls, I-40 is the southern terminus of the Muskogee Turnpike. It then crosses the Arkansas River before passing through southern Sallisaw. The interstate crosses into Arkansas north of Moffett. History 50px West of Oklahoma City, Interstate 40 parallels and replaces Old US-66. US-66 was decommissioned in Oklahoma in 1985. Exit 176 Exit 181 Exit 240A Exit 262 =Bridge collapse= The I-40 bridge over the Arkansas River/McClellan-Kerr Navigation System near Webbers Falls was struck by a barge on May 26, 2002, causing the bridge to collapse and resulting in the death of 14 people. Westbound I-40 traffic was detoured through Gore and Webbers Falls along SH-10, US-64, and SH-100, while eastbound traffic was diverted through Porum and Stigler along SH-2, SH-9, and US-59. Delays of thirty to fifty minutes on the westbound detour were typical, although trains passing through Gore could lengthen wait times by 15 minutes. The eastbound detour added and two hours to the typical trip. Some travelers chose to avoid the area entirely; one Tulsa trucking firm detoured trucks via Springdale, adding to the trip. The detour significantly impacted the town of Gore. Local firefighters directed traffic there 24 hours a day, with daytime temperatures approaching . Businesses in Gore reported loss of revenue due to the traffic; one gas station reported a 30% decline in revenue while traffic was detoured through town. =2013 tornado= On the evening of May 31, 2013, a very large and powerful multiple-vortex tornado occurred over rural areas of central Oklahoma, passing around El Reno, Oklahoma. This is known to be the largest tornado ever recorded at 2.6 miles wide and was responsible for 8 fatalities and 151 injuries. Four of those fatalities were storm chasers, the first known deaths in storm chasing history.https://earthsky.org/earth/el- reno-tornado-on-may-31-now-widest-ever-recorded-in-u-s This tornado crossed over I-40 at around 6:33 p.m. CDT after hitting peak strength and maximum width and did a 270 degree counterclockwise loop north of the interstate, clipping SH 66 before traveling on and along the interstate, approaching Oklahoma City at a very slow speed. The tornado dissipated at 6:43 p.m. near exit 130 (Banner Rd.). https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ie=UTF8&t;=m&oe;=UTF8&msa;=0∣=1L5R0hEfo0uGgVfCUEOthof7ZZWo≪=35.475127732112014%2C-97.96051450000002&z;=12 =2015 shootings= On December 17, 2015, a Pasadena, Texas man allegedly shot and killed two people on Interstate 40 near Weatherford, Oklahoma. He was arrested by police in Clinton, Oklahoma.https://abcnews.go.com/US/dead- apparent-road-rage-shooting-oklahoma-highway/story?id=35819332 Oklahoma City Crosstown realignment The original I-40 Oklahoma City Crosstown Expressway was built in 1966 mostly as an elevated route; however, this former stretch was too narrow for existing traffic, and was frequently in disrepair. In response, the I-40 Crosstown Expressway has been relocated a few blocks south of the original route, and the original bridge torn down. The project was completed in February 2012. The new I-40 Crosstown Expressway has been designed to carry 170,000+ vehicles-per-day traveling at 60 miles-per-hour (97 km/h) using at least ten lanes for traffic, and has breakdown lanes for disabled vehicles and future lane expansion. When the new crosstown opened in 2012, nearly 95% of non-rush hour traffic was considered 'through traffic'; not transferring to or from downtown streets. A landscaped boulevard (Oklahoma City Boulevard) was completed in 2019, replacing the original I-40 Crosstown Bridge right-of-way through downtown Oklahoma City; similar to the I-30 reconstruction through downtown Fort Worth, Texas. Business routes and old alignments right I-40 has eight business routes in Oklahoma, six of which are old alignments of US-66. A number of other old alignments of US-66 are also present west of Oklahoma City. Erick I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop that runs from I-40 two miles (3 km) west of Erick to the old alignment of US-66, through Erick, and back to I-40, four miles (6 km) east of Erick. Sayre I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop that begins two miles (3 km) south of Sayre at US-283, runs north into the city, and then leaves Sayre to the east, rejoining I-40 two miles (3 km) east of US-283. Elk City I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop that begins at Exit 32, seven miles (11 km) west of Elk City. It runs for ten miles (16 km) through Elk City, rejoining I-40 at Exit 41. Clinton I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop that begins at Exit 65, runs five miles (8 km) through Clinton, and rejoins I-40 at Exit 69. Weatherford I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop that exits I-40 at Exit 82B, runs four miles (6 km) through Weatherford, and rejoins I-40 at Exit 82. El Reno I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-66) is a Business Loop through El Reno. It exits I-40 at Exit 119, runs eight miles (13 km) through El Reno, and rejoins I-40 at Exit 125, the interchange with US-81. Henryetta I-40 Business Loop (formerly US-62/US-75) is a Business Loop that leaves I-40 at Exit 237, runs four miles (6 km) through Henryetta, and rejoins I-40 at Exit 240, the interchange with US-75 and the Indian Nation Turnpike. Sallisaw I-40 Business Loop is a Business Loop that leaves I-40 at Exit 308, US-59, runs four miles (6 km) through Sallisaw, and rejoins I-40 at Exit 311, US-64.

She became MS Island Escape in 2002 being renamed once more as MV Ocean Gala in 2015. She was finally renamed MV Ocean Gala 1 before being scrapped in 2018. History She was built in 1982 by Dubigeon-Normandie S.A., Nantes, France for Scandinavian World Cruises (a subsidiary of DFDS) as the cruiseferry MS Scandinavia. At the time of her construction, she was the largest cruiseferry in the world. After being withdrawn from Scandinavian World Cruises, she briefly sailed for DFDS Seaways. Between 1985 and 1990, she sailed for Sundance Cruises and Admiral Cruises as MS Stardancer. In 1990, the ship was sold to Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and renamed MS Viking Serenade. Between January and June 1991, she was converted into a genuine cruise ship at the former Southwest Marine Shipyard in San Diego, California. The car deck was turned into a passenger deck. In 2002, she was transferred to the fleet of Royal Caribbean's new subsidiary Island Cruises as MS Island Escape. In February 1988, a chiropractor named Scott Rolston murdered his wife Karen Waltz by strangling her and dumping the body overboard in order to make it look like a drowning. This was aided by the fact that then Stardancer does not have a tiered setup for the balconies of private cabins. Because of this, Karen was either thrown or pushed from the balcony, and fell straight down into the water below. Rolston was later convicted of her murder. Island Escape was featured in a mini-series TV documentary which consisted of 10 episodes. The documentary was initially broadcast in the UK during 2002. Repeats of the documentary were later shown on Bravo. The documentary followed the working lives of crew members and gave insight into what it was like to work on a cruise ship. On May 25, 2006, Micki Kanesaki was murdered by her ex-husband, Lonnie Kocontes, while aboard the Island Escape. Kanesaki was murdered in the same manner as Karen Waltz 18 years earlier. She joined the fleet of Thomson Cruises in April 2009, but retained her name. Island Escape operated in the Canary Islands and the Western Mediterranean under Thomson Cruises. In November 2010, Thomson was scheduled to spend a further £4 million in refurbishing Island Escape. Thomson Cruises has operated the Island Escape under their all-inclusive Island Cruises since starting March 2013. In 2016, Thomson cruises replaced Island Escape with . On 3 December 2015, it was reported that the vessel had been sold and was on her way to Brest, France for dry-docking, to be renamed Ocean Gala. In February 2016, Ocean Gala was offered as a floating accommodation facility through the website Floating Accommodations, managed by US Shipmanagers, a Florida company and it was announced that the Swedish Migration Agency have signed a contract to use the Ocean Gala as an asylum hotel for 1790 asylum seekers. Initially, permission was sought for a 4 year stint 2016-2020 in the Harbour of Härnösand. Ocean Gala arrived at Utansjöverkets hamn at on 14 June 2016. A police report was filed against the owner of Utansjöverkets hamn by Härnösand Municipality, claiming the facility was missing ISPS classification. According to media, the compensation from the Swedish Migration Agency at SEK450/asylum seeker would generate SEK805,500/day if the asylum hotel was operated at full capacity. The Asylum hotel plans did not come to fruition and the ship was put back on the market for either sale or charter in August 2016. To avoid increased costs for heating and since Ocean Gala did not comply with Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules, the vessel left the port 3 November 2016.

Streicher (September 6, 1921 – February 14, 2006) was an American metallurgist and engineer who became internationally recognized for his work on the testing and development of corrosion-resistant stainless steel alloys. He published widely in technical journals and textbooks and received numerous patents for his inventions. Biography He was born on September 6, 1921, in Heidelberg, Germany, the son of Johann Simon Streicher and Olga Schmidt Streicher. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1931. Streicher received a B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1943, an M.S. degree in chemical engineering from Syracuse University in 1945, and a doctorate in metallurgy from Lehigh University in 1947. The latter degree and subsequent postdoctoral research were sponsored by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. For 30 years, from 1949 to 1979, Streicher worked as a research metallurgist at the Experimental Station of the DuPont Co. in Wilmington, Delaware. He began as a research engineer, advancing to the positions of research fellow and principal consultant. For the next eight years, he served as research professor at the University of Delaware in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Thereafter, he worked as an independent consultant, including work with the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB) on safe storage containers for nuclear waste.Obituary in Materials Performance, published by NACE International, June 2006 issue. His pioneering work developing superferritic stainless steels led to the development of new alloys (see United States Patents 3957544, 4119765, 4456482 and 4456483) which find extensive use in high-efficiency home gas furnaces, as well as in industry. Streicher was a leading developer of corrosion tests for stainless steels and other corrosion resistant alloys. Working through ASTM International he was instrumental in standardizing intergranular corrosion tests, including the ferric sulfate-sulfuric acid testASTM International (2007). \\"ASTM A262-02ae3 Standard Practices for Detecting Susceptibility to Intergranular Attack in Austenitic Stainless Steels\\". now called the \\"Streicher Test\\" in his honor. In 1973, Streicher received the Willis Rodney Whitney Award given to one scientist each year by NACE International, which is a professional organization devoted to corrosion and related problems. Streicher also received other prestigious awards, including Fellow of the American Society for Metals (1970) and Fellow of NACE (1994).

It is located on the shores of the Pahurehure Inlet, approximately 32 kilometres south of the Auckland CBD. It is under the authority of the Auckland Council. Papakura is a Māori word believed to have originated from papa, meaning earth or flat (abbreviation of Papatūānuku) and kura meaning red, reflecting the rich, fertile soil upon which the community was founded. History A village was established at Papakura in the late 1840s by a small group of settler families who sought to farm in the area. Among these early settlers was George Cole, a Welsh immigrant whose legacy in the town has been preserved through Coles Crescent, one of the major thoroughfares in the town centre. The tract of land that was initially purchased was subdivided in 1853, with the street layout that was built initially remaining largely in place today. In 1862, construction of the Great South Road, from Auckland to the Waikato, commenced. The road passed through Papakura and was constructed during the New Zealand Wars to transport supplies to the colonial militias and British Army forces fighting in the Invasion of the Waikato. It was guarded by armed constabulary and was a designated military road. It remains the primary north-south thoroughfare through Papakura and part of the road forms the main street of the Papakura town centre. In 1875, Papakura railway station opened, linking the town to Auckland to the north and Hamilton to the south. In 1882, the Papakura Town District was established, for many years the only such district within what is now the southern portion of the Auckland urban area. In spite of this, the town was not particularly developed, and by 1914 had a population of just 700. In 1911, the first controlled powered flight in New Zealand took place in Papakura. The flight took place inside a single paddock within the racecourse of the now-defunct Papakura Racing Club. The flight was piloted by Vivian Walsh and was carried out in a Howard Wright 1910 Biplane, the parts for which were imported from England in 1910 and assembled by members of the Auckland Aeroplane Syndicate. The Papakura Military Camp was established on the outskirts of the town in 1939 and remains an important base for the New Zealand Army, being the home of the New Zealand Special Air Service. The camp was initially built by the Stevenson family construction business. In the early 2000s some land was set aside for new housing developments. During the major reformation of local government in 1989, Papakura became a district. Prior to 1989, a smaller area was known as Papakura City. The new district included parts of the surrounding rural countryside that had previously been part of Manukau City. The newly amalgamated area was known as the Papakura District. Instead of being an independent city, as Papakura had been previously, the district became a part of the also newly-created Auckland Regional Council area. From October 2010, after a review of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, the various cities and districts of the Auckland Region were amalgamated into a single unitary authority, governed by the Auckland Council. As well as the Papakura District, the other cities and districts within the Auckland Region, such as the neighbouring Manukau City, as well as the regional council itself, were abolished with the entire area merged into a single authority. Papakura and the other suburbs of the former Papakura District are now in the Papakura Local Board within the Manurewa- Papakura Ward of the Auckland Council. The entirety of Papakura and the former district is included as part of the Auckland urban area for statistical purposes, forming part of its southern boundary. Demographics Papakura, comprising the statistical areas of Papakura West, Papakura North, Papakura Central, Papakura North East, Papakura Kelvin, Papakura Massey Park and Papakura East, had a population of 22,296 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 3,267 people (17.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 4,830 people (27.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 6,585 households. There were 10,980 males and 11,313 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.97 males per female, with 5,688 people (25.5%) aged under 15 years, 5,202 (23.3%) aged 15 to 29, 9,183 (41.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 2,220 (10.0%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 46.2% European/Pākehā, 34.2% Māori, 21.6% Pacific peoples, 16.9% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 25.7%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 41.0% had no religion, 37.5% were Christian, 5.0% were Hindu, 1.4% were Muslim, 0.9% were Buddhist and 7.3% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 2,334 (14.1%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 3,849 (23.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 8,385 (50.5%) people were employed full-time, 1,824 (11.0%) were part-time, and 1,110 (6.7%) were unemployed. =Papakura industrial area= The area southeast of Papakura is almost entirely industrial. Papakura Industrial had a population of 204 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 9 people (4.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3 people (1.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 51 households. There were 105 males and 99 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.06 males per female. The median age was 32.7 years, with 57 people (27.9%) aged under 15 years, 36 (17.6%) aged 15 to 29, 96 (47.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 12 (5.9%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 50.0% European/Pākehā, 32.4% Māori, 25.0% Pacific peoples, and 17.6% Asian (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 26.5%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 33.8% had no religion, 42.6% were Christian, 5.9% were Hindu, 1.5% were Muslim, 2.9% were Buddhist and 11.8% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (8.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 36 (24.5%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 78 (53.1%) people were employed full-time, 9 (6.1%) were part-time, and 9 (6.1%) were unemployed. Education The following schools are located in Papakura (schools in Takanini and other adjacent suburbs are excluded): Papakura High School is a secondary school (years 9–13) with a roll of . The school was established in 1954. In 2020, Māori students were 59% of the roll and Pacific Islands students were 29%. Papakura Intermediate is an intermediate school (years 7–8) with a roll of . The school opened in 1962. From 2000 to 2017 it was called Mansell Senior School. In 2018, Māori students were 74% of the roll and Pacific Islands students were 22%. Papakura Normal School and Edmund Hillary School are full primary schools (years 1–8) with rolls of and students, respectively. Papakura Normal opened as Papakura North School in 1953, and changed to its current name when it affiliated to Ardmore Teachers College in 1958. Edmund Hillary opened in 1963. Its name pays tribute to the mountaineer. Papakura Central School, Kelvin Road School and Cosgrove School are contributing primary schools (years 1–6) with rolls of , and students, respectively. Papakura Central traces its origins back to 1876. Kelvin Road opened in 1968. Cosgrove opened in 1959. All these schools are coeducational. Rolls are as of Facilities =Government= In addition to the Local Council Chambers, Papakura is served by a large police station (one of Auckland's busiest), a District Court, and a WINZ office. In the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004, the Papakura Courthouse was where the Pitcairn Supreme Court sat to hear the case. =Armed Forces= Papakura once served a large military population, but now only the SAS special forces are based at Papakura. Nearby houses were originally Army Homes, but are now in private hands. =Transport= Overview of Papakura Railway Station, viewed from Clevedon Road State Highway 1 and the North Island Main Trunk railway run through the Papakura District. State Highway 1 ran down Great South Road through central Papakura until 1965, when it was bypassed by the Auckland Southern Motorway. Public transport is provided by train and bus services, with frequent trains on the Southern Line between Papakura and the CBD (Britomart). Recent investment has focused on upgrading and refurbishing the region's trains and suburban railway stations, most recently with the opening of a modern station facility at the town centre. Papakura is the final stop for most southbound public transport in Auckland, and Papakura is the third busiest station on the rail network. Drawn by frequent services into and out of the city, rail commuters come from Papakura itself, Franklin County and the northern Waikato. Though the motorway and Great South Road flow relatively freely at peak times, road commuters are affected by the acute traffic congestion as they get closer to metropolitan Auckland. =Sport and Recreation= Some notable sports facilities include an indoor-outdoor swimming pool, an international-quality athletics track, a sports stadium, and venues for rugby, netball, cricket, golf, tennis, badminton, soccer, and many other sports. The council also operates a library and a theatre. Papakura also has a number of skate parks, and a skate bowl. Papakura is home to association football club Papakura City, who compete in the Lotto Sport Italia NRFL Division 2, rugby union club Papakura RFC who are members of the Counties Manukau Rugby Union, rugby league club Papakura Sea Eagles, who compete in the Auckland Rugby League's Fox Memorial competition (division 1), and Papakura Cricket Club who compete in the Counties Manukau Cricket Association competition. Papakura and the surrounding area is represented by the Counties Manukau Steelers in first-class rugby union and Northern Districts in first- class cricket.

It was formed as a result of Emperor Basil II’s annexation of a portion of the Bagrationi Dynasty domains (1000–1021) and later aggrandized at the expense of several Armenian kingdoms acquired by the Byzantines in a piecemeal fashion in the course of the 11th century. The population of the theme—at its largest extent—was multiethnic with a possible Georgian majority, including a sizable Armenian community of Chalcedonic rite to which Byzantines sometimes expanded, as a denominational name, the ethnonym \\"Iberian\\", a Graeco-Roman designation of Georgians.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, p. 414. Peeters Bvba .Арутюновой – Фиданян, В. А. Типик Григория Пакуриана. Введение, перевод и комментарий. Ереван, 1978, с. 249. The theme ceased to exist in 1074 as a result of the Seljuk invasions.  Foundation and enlargement  The theme was created by the emperor Basil II (976–1025) from the lands inherited from the Georgian prince David III of Tao. These areas – parts of the Armeno-Georgian marchlands centered on Thither Tao, including Theodosioupolis (now Erzurum, Turkey), Phasiane, Hark’, Apahunik’, Mardali (Mardaghi), Khaldoyarich, and Ch’ormayari – had been granted to David for his crucial assistance to Basil against the rebel commander Bardas Sclerus in 979. However, David's rebuff of Basil in Bardas Phocas’ revolt of 987 evoked Constantinople’s distrust of the Caucasian rulers. After the failure of the revolt, David was forced to make Basil II the legatee of his extensive possessions. Basil gathered his inheritance upon David’s death in 1000, forcing the successor Georgian Bagratid ruler Bagrat III to recognize the new rearrangement. Bagrat’s son, George I, however, inherited a longstanding claim to David’s succession. While Basil was preoccupied with his Bulgarian campaigns, George gained momentum to invade Tao and Phasiane in 1014. Defeated in the ensuing Byzantine-Georgian wars, George had to relinquish further lands – Kola, Artaan and Javakheti – to the Byzantine crown in 1022.Lang, David Marshall (1966), The Georgians, pp. 109–110. Praeger Publishers. These provinces were organized by Basil II into the theme of Iberia with the capital at Theodosiopolis. Henceforth, the theme of Iberia was administered jointly with Ducate of Chaldia. As a result, the political center of the Georgian state moved north, as did a significant part of the Georgian nobility,Edwards, Robert W. (1988), The Vale of Kola: A Final Preliminary Report on the Marchlands of Northeast Turkey, p. 126. Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol. 42. while the empire gained a critical foothold for further expansion into the territories of Armenia and Georgia. 255x255px  Government  199x199px The exact chronology of the theme of Iberia and of its governors is not completely clear. Unfortunately, the few Greek seals from the theme or from the ambiguous \\"Interior Iberia\\" can seldom be dated precisely.Edwards (1988), pp. 138–140 Although many scholars maintain that the theme was probably created immediately after the annexation of David of Tao's princedom, it is difficult to ascertain whether Byzantine rule extended into Tao permanently in 1000 or only after Georgia's defeat in 1022. It is also impossible to identify any commander in Iberia before the appointment, in 1025/6, of the eunuch Niketas of Pisidia as the doux or katepano of Iberia. Some scholars believe, however, that the first doux of Iberia was either Romanos Dalassenos or his brother Theophylactos appointed between 1022 and 1027 in the aftermath of Basil's Georgian campaigns.Holmes, Catherine (2005), Basil II and the Governance of Empire (976–1025), pp. 362–3. Oxford University Press, . After 1045 Iberia also included the former Kingdom of Ani. Since 1071 Gregory Pakourianos was a governor of the Theme of Iberia. The Iberian governor was aided by tax officials, judges, and by co administrators who shared in the exercise of the military and civil duties. Among these officials were the domesticos of the East, the administrators of the districts of which the theme was composed, and the occasional extraordinary legates sent there by the emperor. Apart from the regular Byzantine garrisons, an indigenous army of peasant soldiers guarded the area and received in turn an allotment of tax-free government land. This changed, however, when Constantine IX (1042–1055) dismantled the army of the theme of Iberia, perhaps 5,000 men, converting its obligations from military service to the payment of tax. Constantine dispatched Nikolaos Serblias to conduct an inventory and to exact taxes that had never been demanded previously.  End of the Theme  Constantine's reforms caused great discontent in the theme and exposed it to hostile attack aided by the removal of regular troops from the region, first to crush the Macedonian revolt of Leo Tornicius, himself the former catapan of Iberia (1047),This Leo Tornicius should not be confused with Leo Tornikios Kontoleon, Catapan of Italy, in 1017. and later to halt the Pecheneg advance. In 1048-9, the Seljuk Turks under Ibrahim Yinal made their first incursion in this region and clashed with a combined Byzantine-Armenian and Georgian army of 50,000 at the Battle of Kapetrou on September 10, 1048. During this expedition, tens of thousands of Christians are said to have been massacred and several areas were reduced to piles of ashes. In 1051/52, Eustathius Boilas, a Byzantine magnate who moved from Cappadocia to the theme of Iberia, found the land \\"foul and unmanageable... inhabited by snakes, scorpions, and wild beasts.\\" About 1053 Constantine IX disbanded what the historian John Skylitzes calls the \\"Iberian Army\\", which consisted of 50,000 men and it was turned as a contemporary Drungary of the Watch. two other knowledgeable contemporaries, the former officials Michael Attaleiates and Kekaumenos, agree with Skylitzes that by demobilizing these soldiers Constantine did catastrophic harm to the Empire's eastern defenses. Kekaumenos says that Constantine's demobilization covered \\"Iberia and Mesopotamia\\", Attaliates refers to the demobilized district as \\"the Iberian land\\" which was evidently the same as \\"the land of the Iberians\\". the region of the demobilized \\"Iberian Army\\" evidently included everything north of the ducates of Antioch and Edessa and east of the old Anatolian themes. The other themes were probably called \\"Iberian\\" because after the conquest of Iberia in 1000 the general command over them was transferred from the Duke of Mesopotamia to the Duke of Iberia.Treadgold, Warren T. Byzantium And Its Army, 284–1081. 1st ed. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1995. Print. In the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, south- eastern parts theme was annexed by Seljuks. still, it may have lasted as late as 1074 when Gregory Pakourianos, a Byzantine governor, formally ceded a portion of the theme including Tao and Kars to King George II of Georgia. This did not help, however, to stem the Turkish advance and the area became a battleground of the Georgian-Seljuk wars.

Originally the knights moved into the fortress as an ally of Poland against the Margraviate of Brandenburg. However, after disputes over the control of the city between the Order and the King of Poland arose, the knights murdered a number of citizens within the city and took it as their own. Thus the event is also known as Gdańsk massacre or Gdańsk slaughter (rzeź Gdańska).Society and culture: Poland in Europe : studies in social and cultural history : Poland at the 18-th International Congress of Historical Sciences in Montreal Maria Bogucka Advancement of Sciences - Education \\"UN-O\\", 1995, page 10 \\"Such events as the Gdańsk slaughter of 1308\\"The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Volumen 25 Encyclopædia Britannica, inc Encyclopædia Britannica, 2003, page 941 \\"The massacre the Knights perpetrated in Gdańsk in 1308 entered Polish folklore\\".Pomerania was taken by the Prussian Order beginning with the so called \\"massacre of Gdansk\\" on November 14, 1308.Paulus Vladimiri and his doctrine concerning international law and politics, Volume 2, Stanislaus F.

Those, having captured the castle in 1308 butchered the population. Since then the event is known as 'the Gdańsk slaughter'.\\" Though in the past, a matter of debate among historians, a consensus has been established that many people were murdered and a considerable part of the town was destroyed in the context of the take-over. In the aftermath of the take- over, the order seized all of Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania) and bought up the supposed Brandenburgian claims to the region in the Treaty of Soldin (1309). The conflict with Poland was temporarily settled in the Treaty of Kalisz/Kalisch (1343). The town was returned to Poland in the Peace of Toruń/Thorn in 1466.  Background  In the 13th century, the Pomerelian duchy was ruled by members of the Samborides, originally stewards for the Polish Piast kings and dukes. The stewards asserted their power from fortified strongholds. The major stronghold of the area was at the location of present- day Gdańsk's Old Town. The adjacent town developed from a market place of tradesmen and was granted Lübeck city rights by Duke Swietopelk II in 1224. Swietopelk II, 1228 Under Swietopelk II, Gdańsk became an important trading site on the lower Vistula. The Margraviate of Brandenburg entered the scene after Mestwin II, son of Swietopolk, concluded the Treaty of Arnswalde with them, in order to receive aid against his brother, Wartislaw. The margraves took over the town in 1270/1 from Wartislaw, but did not hand it over to Mestwin until the latter was able to force them out by concluding an alliance with Boleslaw Pobozny, duke of Greater Poland. Under the rule of Brandenburg, conflicts erupted between the Slavic and German populations, which cost many lives. In the 1282 Treaty of KępnoPoland and Germany, East & West, Published by Studies Centre on Polish-German Affairs, London, 1971 Mestwin II promised his Pomerelian duchy to his ally Przemysł II, duke and later king of Poland, who succeeded to the duchy after Mestwin's death in 1294. The Margraves of Brandenburg also claimed the region and had Przemysł assassinated in early 1296. Władysław I the Elbow-high (Łokietek), Przemysł's successor, was only in loose control of Pomerelia and Gdańsk with the actual control of the area being in the hands of the local Swienca family who had come into power already under Mestwin II. In 1301, one year after Wenceslaus II of Bohemia had been crowned king of Poland, the princes of Rügen, who also claimed to be the heirs of Pomerelia, mounted an expedition. Wenceslaus, who with the Polish crown had also acquired the claim to Pomerelia, called the Teutonic Order for help. The Teutonic knights occupied Gdańsk, repelled the princes of Rügen, and left the town in 1302. While the Norwegian king Haakon backed Rügen's claims, his 1302 call to the Hanseatic cities for aid remained without answer. Wenceslaus II died in 1305 and was succeeded by Wenceslaus III, murdered in 1306. In a treaty of 8 August 1305, the margraves of Brandenburg promised to Wenceslaus III the Meissen (Miśnia) territory in exchange for Pomerelia, but that treaty was never finalized. The Teutonic Order had inherited Gniew (Mewe) from Sambor II, thus gaining a foothold on the left bank of the Vistula. Brandenburg occupied the west of the duchy after neutralizing another claimant to the area, the Cammin bishop, by burning down his see. =Rebellion of 1308 and Brandenburgian siege= Meanwhile, Władysław I the Elbow-high had reestablished his power in Poland, but was occupied in the south of his realm. He appointed Bogusza as his Pomerelian governor in Gdańsk. In the summer of 1308, a Pomerelian rebellion in the city unseated the forces loyal to Łokietek, who later would become King of Poland, and allied with Waldemar of Brandenburg.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A history of Poland, 1979 , pg. 74 The rebellion was led by the Swienca family, who called the margraves for help. The latter entered Gdańsk with an army and were welcomed by its burghers. Bogusza and his men had retreated to the castle next to the town, and were besieged by the margraves. Bogusza, on the advice of the Dominican prior Wilhelm,Poland's Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych, Dzieje miast Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: Polska w słowie i obrazach, 1928 appealed to the Teutonic Knights in Prussia for assistance.Aleksander Gieysztor, Stefan Kieniewicz, Emanuel Rostworowski, Janusz Tazbir, and Henryk Wereszycki: History of Poland. PWN. Warsaw, 1979.  Teutonic takeover  The Knights, under the leadership of Heinrich von Plotzke, agreed to aid Bogusza, and a force of 100 knights and 200 supporters, led by Günther von Schwarzburg, arrived at the castle around August. While historians agree that the castle as well as the adjacent town were in the hands of the Teutonic Knights by late November 1308 the number of casualties and the extent of destruction is debated. Quote: \\"Doch über den Ablauf der Ereignisse streiten die Historiker bis heute. Gab es bis zu 10000 oder nur 16 Tote, wurde die Stadt dem Erdboden gleichgemacht oder nur leicht zerstört, ...\\", Also: Quote p. 60: \\"The fact that the knights did indeed conquer Gdańsk is beyond doubt. The manner and circumstances in which this occurred, however, have occasioned much acrimonious controversy ... chief point of controversy has been the number of milites et nobiles who perished that night ...\\" Peter Oliver Loew writes that for a long time German historians accepted the version of events given by Teutonic Knights, and didn't accept a high number of people murdered, with the number given between 60 and 100 victims Błażej Śliwiński, based on several sources argues that the number of murdered was very high, even if not 10,000. According to Peter Oliver Loew the exact numbers can never be established, however he agrees that all available data confirms that the city was destroyed during the conquest. =Ethnicity of the town's inhabitants= According to Raphael Lemkin the population in the city at the time was Polish.Axis rule in occupied Europe Raphael Lemkin 1944 reprinted in 2004. According to Kazimierz Jaśinski, the Knights captured the town with the help from some of the German burghers, who constituted a very small minority within the town at the time. Note: English language edition, 1995, \\"History of Gdansk\\" James Minahan wrote that the city inhabitants, for the most part, were Kashubians.James Minahan, One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, , p.376 According to Peter Oliver Loew, there were German as well as Slavic inhabitants of the town. According to Stefan Maria Kuczyński, the German population only achieved the majority after local Polish population was murdered and a new settlement was built by Teutonic Knights.Stefan M. Kuczyński, Bitwa pod Grunwaldem. Katowice: Śląsk 1987, page 17. =Teutonic Knights entering the town= According to Błażej Śliwiński at the time of events, Gdańsk with surrounding settlements had around 2000 to 3000 inhabitantsSetki padły pod toporem 05.12.2008 Gazeta Wyborcza Trójmiasto The forces of the order had arrived in two columns: one re-inforced the Polish garrison in the castle, the other one marched against the town from the south and raised a siege. In the castle, conflict arose between the Teutonic and Polish knights, with the latter opposing a take-over by the former. After several encounters, the outnumbered Polish forces left the castle, with some of them defecting to the rebellious inhabitants of the town and the Brandenburgers. In the evening of 12 November 1308, the Teutonic Knights succeeded in forcing their way inside the town. During the ensuing close combat in the streets, the Teutonic Knights gained the upper hand over the defending Brandenburgian forces, burghers and Pomerelian knights. The victorious knights killed many citizens and opposing knights. By the morning of 13 November, the defendants were utterly defeated, bodies were lying in the streets and executions were going on. According to Halina Wątróbska, half of the town was promised to the Teutonic Order in return for aiding Bogusza's men. The Teutonic Knights then moved in, defeated the Brandenburgers and had the townspeople accept Łokietek as their suzerain. However, on 13 November they \\"took over the whole town, thereby killing everyone who defied their will.\\" Udo Arnold says that a dispute between the castle's garrison and the Teutonic knights arose when the Brandenburgers were about to leave. While the dispute was about the co-ordination of further action and unsettled payment, Arnold says that it was at the same time that \\"the order's policy changed from providing aid towards annexing Pomerelia and buying up existing legal claims,\\" which was opposed by the population of Danzig. This was answered by the order on 13 November \\"by the uncompromising levelling of the greater part of the town.\\" Quote: \\"Die polnische Seite wandte sich an den Deutschen Orden um Hilfe. Der ging bereitwillig, wie schon in der Vergangenheit, darauf ein. Kaum aber stand der Rückzug der Brandenburger bevor, entbrannte heftiger Streit mit der Danziger Burgbesatzung über die weitere Vorgehensweise. Auch die Kosten der gesamten Expedition waren ungeklärt. Aus den Verbündeten von einst wurden Gegner, bei der preußischen Führung wuchs die Neigung, das gesamte Herzogtum dem Ordensstaat einzuverleiben und bestehende Rechtsansprüche. Den Widerstand der Stadt Danzig beantworteten die Ordenstruppen am 13. November 1308 mit der rücksichtslosen Niederlegung weiter Stadtgebiete.\\" Ulrich Nieß says that as a consequence of the appearance of Teutonic Order forces in the castle, the Brandenburgers left, and soon left also the initial Pomerelian and Kuyavian garrison of the castle after a dispute with the Teutonic Knights. The town, though still preferring Brandenburg rule, offered asylum to the garrison, and in relying on its Lübeck law charter refused to allow the Teutonic Knights to enter and to follow an order to lay down its fortifications. On 13 November, the order's forces with personal involvement of Plotzke forced their way into the town, though no larger battle took place. The order then held a tribunal in the town and ordered large-scale demolishments of its buildings. Quote: \\"Zwischen der pomeranisch-kujawischen Burgmannschaft und den einziehenden Ordensverbänden traten schon sehr bald Spannungen auf, die zum Abzug der ersteren aus der Burg führten. Zurück zogen sich auch die Truppen der Brandenburger, die das Eingreifen des Ordens, wie erwähnt, völlig unerwartet traf. Die Stadt Danzig selbst öffnete hingegen den aus der Burg abziehenden Verbänden aus Pomeranen und Kujawiern die Tore. Die Führer der deutschrechtlichen civitas wollten offenbar auch jetzt noch den Anschluß an die Markgrafschaft, mindestens aber verweigerten sie dem Ordensheer den Einzug. Es kam zu Kampfhandlungen, in deren Gefolge die Stadt am 13. November 1308 zur Übergabe gezwungen wurde. Heinrich von Plötzke hatte die Operation persönlich geleitet. Langwierige oder verlustreiche Kämpfe haben allerdings nicht stattgefunden und können daher auch nicht für das schwere Ausmaß an Zerstörungen, denen insbesondere die Rechtstadt, die civitas, zum Opfer fiel, verantwortlich sein. ... Die Ordensleitung verlangte offenbar von der Stadtgemeinde die Niederlegung ihrer Befestigungsanlagen - eine Maßnahme, die Mestwin II. 1272 ebenfalls angeordnet hatte. Die Stadt fügte sich aber 1308 nicht dem Befehl des Ordens, verwies auf ihre Privilegien und wohl auch darauf, daß der Orden nicht der Landesherr war. Auf Ordensseite wiederum gehörte es zur selbstverständlichen Gepflogenheit, keine umfangreichen städtischen Befestigungsanlagen zu dulden; er verbot derartiges auch bei seinen eigenen Stadtgründungen. Militärisches Sicherheitsdenken traf hier auf städtisches Selbstbewußtsein, in den Augen der Ordensleitung war die Stadtgemeinde „hochmütig\\", während die Danziger meinten, der Orden habe keine Rechtsgrundlage für sein Ansinnen. Infolge dieser spezifischen Konstellation eskalierte der Konflikt, kam es zu einer Politik der Härte. Die Bürger mußten - sicherlich alles andere als freiwillig - ihre Häuser räumen, die verbrannt wurden.\\" = Massacre records = Soon after the take-over, on 19 June 1310, the Teutonic Knights faced charges that they had committed a massacre in a bull issued by pope Clement V: \\"Latest news were brought to my attention, that officials and brethren of the aforementioned Teutonic order have hostilely intruded the lands of Our beloved son Wladislaw, duke of Cracow and Sandomierz, and in the town of Gdańsk killed more than ten thousand people with the sword, inflicting death on whining infants in cradles whom even the enemy of faith would have spared.\\". For the Latin original and a contemporary copy see Jenks et al: Virtual PrUB 2.13 and the sources given by Nieß, p. 74, fn. 147, quote: \\"Novissime vero ad nostrum venit auditum, quod dicti preceptores et fratres hospitalis ejusdem dilecti filii nobisg) viri Wladislai Cracovie et Sandomirie ducis terram hostiliter subintrantes in civitate Gdansco ultra decem milia hominum gladio peremerunt infantibus vagientibus in cunis mortis exitium inferentes, quibus etiam hostis fidei pepercisset.\\" Nieß translates this as follows: \\"Neuerdings aber gelangte zu unserer Kenntnis, daß die genannten Gebietiger und Brüder desselben Hospitals in das Land unseres (des edlen, ) geliebten Sohnes Wladyslaw, des Herzogs von Krakau und Sandomierz, feindlich eingedrungen sind und in der Stadt Danzig mehr als 10.000 Menschen mit dem Schwert getötet haben, dabei wimmernden Kindern in den Wiegen den Tod bringend, welche sogar der Feind des Glaubens geschont hätte.\\" The source of the allegation is unknown. The respective bull contained other charges against the Teutonic Order, resulting from a dispute between its Livonian branch and the citizens as well as the archbishop of Riga, Friedrich von Pernstein.; Quote: \\"Friedrich von Riga, seit 1305 Kläger gegen die Herrschaft der Ritterbrüder in Livland, hielt sich seit 1307 wieder ständig in der Nähe des Papsthofes auf, erreichte aber erst jetzt sein Ziel: Die Inquisition in Livland\\" According to Ulrich Nieß, von Pernstein was the likely the source of the allegation of the ten thousand massacred. The bull called for an investigation of the charges which was started by Francis of Moliano in 1312.Initially, John, archbishop of Bremen and chaplain Albert of Milan were to investigate the charges, in 1311, the latter was replaced by Francis of Moliano. , also see p. 214-215 for a comparison with the contemporary charges against the Knights Templar. During the inquisition, Moliano excommunicated the Teutonic Knights, but this was reversed in 1313. The Riga lawsuit was finally decided in the Teutonic Order's favor by Clement's successor John XXII after a hearing in Avignon in 1319. Under Władysław Łokietek and his successor Casimir III the Great an additional two lawsuits were filed against the order at the curia, both aiming at the return of Pomerelia. The sites of investigation were Inowrocław and Brześć Kujawski in 1320/21 and Warsaw in 1339. The judges were Domarat, bishop of Poznań, Janisław, archbishop of Gniezno and, Nikolaus (Mikolaj), abbot of Mogilno in the first case and Galhard of Chartres and Peter (Pierre) of Gervais in the second case. Witness and eyewitness reports collected during these cases include mentions of killings during the take-over of Danzig, referred to e.g. as strage magna or maxima (great (est) murder/bloodbath), while the Teutonic Order admitted the killing of 15 to 16 Pomerelian knights. The testimonies from the lawsuits and the order's responses are the primary sources used by historians to reconstruct the events. The lawsuits did not have any practical effect on the order, who won both cases by appeal. In the 15th century, era of the Polish- Teutonic Wars, medieval Polish chronicler Jan Długosz in epic prose described the event as a slaughter of Polish nationals, regardless of condition, age or gender.Raphael Lemkin, Samantha Power, Axis rule in occupied Europe: laws of occupation, analysis of government, proposals for redress, The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd., 2005, p.154, : cite of an excerpt of Dlugosii Joanni canonii Cracoviensis Historiae Polonicae, fn.1 Modern sources are divided as to the actual extent of the massacre though they all agree that mass killings did take place. Quote: \\"[...] streiten die Historiker noch heute. Gab es bis zu 10000 oder nur 16 Tote, [...]\\" Historian Matthew Kuefler states: \\"German and Polish historians in the twentieth century tended to have diverging both on the question of whether Pomerelia really \\"belonged\\" to Poland and also on the degree of ferocity of the order's conquest\\".Matthew Kuefler, The Boswell Thesis: Essays on Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality, The city of Gdańsk states that \\"The Teutonic Knights, having captured the castle in 1308 butchered the population. Since then the event is known as the Gdańsk slaughter\\". In many Polish works, the takeover is indeed referred to as \\"Gdańsk slaughter\\" (rzeź Gdańska). Norman Davies in his extensive history of Poland, while not insisting on the number of 10,000 dead, says that the knights \\"drove Waldemar from the city, and calmly slaughtered its inhabitants\\",Norman Davies, God's Playground: A history of Poland, 1979 similar descriptions are presented also in some other English books with sections on Polish history.Gunnar Alexandersson, \\"The Baltic Straits\\", Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1982, pg. 52, Alan W. Ertl, \\"Toward an Understanding of Europe: A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration\\", Universal-Publishers, 2008, pg. 346 Jerzy Lukowski in \\"A concise history of Poland\\" says that the knights massacred \\"Lokietek's men\\".Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki, \\"A concise history of Poland\\", Cambridge University Press, 2001, pg. 19, Błażej Śliwiński says that there was a bloodbath which cost an abundance of lives, though not 10,000, and that such massacres were common in medieval Europe., and that the term \\"slaughter\\" in Medieval Ages usually meant murder of around 1000 people.Setki padły pod toporem 05.12.2008 Gazeta Wyborcza Trójmiasto \\"W średniowieczu określenie \\"rzeź\\" odnosiło się do wydarzeń, które przynosiły około 1000 ofiar (...) mówi Błażej Śliwiński.\\" According to Peter Oliver Loew, older German historiography was more inclined to trust the Knights' claims and argued that a number of 10,000 is virtually impossible for a medieval town. A number of 60 to 100 was regarded as reasonable. This view was shared by many Polish historians after World War II, however, Błażej Śliwiński's presented numerous pieces of evidence that what occurred was indeed a \\"bloodbath\\" with a very high number of victims, although not as high as 10,000, and more likely around 1000. Loew adds that from the source material available to historians, the definite number of casualties is impossible to establish.Peter Oliver Loew: \\"Danzig\\", p. 36: \\"Deutsche Historiker hatten lange den Beteuerungen des Ordens größeres Vertrauen geschenkt und argumentiert, 10 000 Tote seien in einer Stadt, die kaum so viele Einwohner besaß, schlicht unmöglich gewesen, es könnten höchstens 60 bis 100 gewesen sein. Während ihnen nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg auch viele polnische Historiker Recht gaben, stellt Błażej Śliwiński zahlreiche Indizien zusammen, dass es tatsächlich ein \\"Blutbad\\" mit einer erschreckend hohen Zahl von Opfern - wenn auch nicht 10 000 - gegeben haben dürfte.\\" William Urban says that the number of 10,000 dead has been considered greater than the city's population at the time. Kazimierz Jasiński states that the number of those killed was \\"not less than sixty, and not more than several hundred\\", that the victims were killed after the takeover rather than during it, and hence the massacre was carried out on defenseless individuals, both knights and burghers, who had laid down their arms. According to Jasiński says the 16 deaths admitted by the order were actually only the most famous Polish knights among those killed. Błażej Śliwiński (2008) estimates the number of dead between 50 and 60 knights, including 16 from notable houses, and over 1000 commoners among the city's population, which he gives as between 2,000 and 3,000 people (including surrounding settlements).Setki padły pod toporem 05.12.2008 Gazeta Wyborcza Trójmiasto\\"W tym czasie w Gdańsku i przyległych osadach mieszkało nie więcej niż 2-3 tys. mieszkańców. W średniowieczu określenie \\"rzeź\\" odnosiło się do wydarzeń, które przynosiły około 1000 ofiar. Moim zdaniem w nocy z 12 na 13 listopada zginęło ponad 1000 mieszkańców Gdańska - mówi Błażej Śliwiński.\\" Gerard Labuda and Marian Biskup (1993) write that the number of murdered inhabitants is not established, but that the victims of the massacre include at least several dozen notable knights and members of nobility as well as significant number of commoners and simple soldiers.Dzieje Zakonu Krzyżackiego w Prusach Marian Biskup, Gerard Labuda, page 256, Wydawnictwo Morskie, 1986 Biskup in a later publication from 1993 writes that victims included defenders of the castle and burghers along with members of their families in addition to 100 murdered knights.Wojny Polski z zakonem krzyżackim, 1308–1521 Marian Biskup, page 12, Wydawnictwo \\"Marpress\\", 1993 According to Maksymilian Grzegorz (1997), German historians tend to minimize the number of murdered victims of the Teutonic Knights, while Polish historians estimate the number at between at minimum 60 to several hundred.Pomorze Gdańskie pod rza̜dami Zakonu krzyżackiego w latach 1308–1466 Maksymilian Grzegorz, Wydawnictwo Uczelniane Wyższej Szkoły Pedagogicznej, page 63 1997 =Destruction of the town= Historians are divided on whether the townspeople after the take-over had to demolish only the city walls or, in addition, at least part of the town's buildings. Based on recent archaeological findings, Loew says that this conflict is about to be decided in favor of the destruction thesis: \\"burn marks and clear evidence for planation of the terrain in the early 14th century prove its [the town's] destruction in the years of 1308/09 by the Teutonic Order.\\" According to Ulrich Nieß, the destruction of the town was part of the order's policy of securing its lands from potential inner rivals. Nieß says that the destruction of the city walls was in line with the order's contemporary policy of not allowing their own foundations to be substantially fortified either, and that the refusal of the town to obey to the order's demand to level their walls led to a \\"policy of hardness\\" being implemented on the townspeople, who had to evacuate their houses which afterward were burned down. Nieß says that the procurator of the order had himself reported these proceedings to the pope, claiming the burghers evacuated and burned their houses voluntarily (which Nieß strongly denies). Nieß is also pointing out that in the subsequent capture of Tczew (Dirschau) by the order, the townspeople similarly had to sign an agreement to evacuate their homes, though this was not put into effect. According to Loew, the archaeological evidence suggests that it took a couple of years before new streets and buildings were built on top of the flattened debris of the former buildings, though there probably were areas of the town which had remained unharmed. Referring to records of Danzig burghers taking residence in Lübeck, Loew says it is likely that most of the former inhabitants left Danzig in 1308.  Aftermath  Pomerelia (Pommerellen) while part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. When the Poles refused to accept monetary compensation for the Knights' takeover of the city, the Order resorted to conquering further towns like Świecie. The local colony of merchants and artisans was specifically attacked because they competed with the Knights' town of Elbing (Elbląg), a nearby city.William Urban: The Teutonic Knights: A Military History. Greenhill Books. London, 2003. The Knights also attacked Tczew (Dirschau). The Knights then captured the rest of Pomerelia from Brandenburg's troops. In September 1309, Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg-Stendal sold his claim to the territory to the Teutonic Order for 10,000 marks in the Treaty of Soldin (now Myślibórz), thereby connecting the State of the Teutonic Order with that of the Holy Roman Empire. While for the order, this landbridge with the empire was a major strategic improvement by connecting its Baltic territories to its German bailiwicks (ballei), it was at the same time a major loss for Poland who had become a landlocked country.Norman Housley, The later Crusades, 1274–1580: from Lyons to Alcazar, Oxford University Press, 1992, p.326, Brigitte Jäger-Dabek, Polen: Eine Nachbarschaftskunde für Deutsche 2nd edition, Ch. Links Verlag, 2006, p.91, Thus, the takeover triggered a series of conflicts between Poland and the Teutonic Order, and these conflicts in turn triggered a conflict within the order itself. Some prominent brethren favoured a concession of Pomerelia in exchange for good relations with Poland, but were opposed by a majority of the knights who thought that such a concession would eventually lead to the total expulsion of the knights from their state.Norman Housley, The later Crusades, 1274–1580: from Lyons to Alcazar, Oxford University Press, 1992, p.327, These disagreements caused the abdication of Grand Master Charles of Trier in 1318 and the murder of the succeeding Grand Master Werner of Orseln in 1330. The possession of Danzig and Pomerelia by the Teutonic Order was questioned consistently by the Polish kings Władysław I and Casimir the Great in legal suits in the papal court in 1320 and 1333. Both times, as well as in 1339, the Teutonic Knights were ordered by the Pope to return Pomerelia and other lands back to Poland, but did not comply. As a result, in the late 1330s, a war ensued. Peace was established in the Treaty of Kalisz in 1343; although the Polish kings were able to retain the title \\"Duke of Pomerania\\" and were recognized as titular overlords of the crusaders, the Knights retained control of Danzig. \\\\- this time, with the permission of the papal court. Development of the city stagnated after its capture by the Teutonic Knights. Initially the new rulers tried to reduce the economic significance of Danzig by abolishing the local government and the privileges of the merchants. This was exemplified by the fact that the city council, including Arnold Hecht and Conrad Letzkau, was removed and beheaded in 1411.Natalia i Waldemar Borzestowscy, \\"Dlaczego zginął burmistrz\\" (\\"Why did the mayor die?\\"), Later the Knights were forced to accept the fact that city defended its independence and was the largest and most important seaport of the region after overtaking Elbing. Subsequently, it flourished, benefiting from major investment and economic prosperity in the Monastic state and Poland, which stimulated trade along the Vistula. The city had become a full member of the merchant association, the Hanseatic League by 1361, but its merchants remained resentful at the barriers to trade up the Vistula river with Poland, along with the lack of political rights in a state ruled in the interest of the Order's religiously motivated knight-monks. As a result, the city became a co-founder of the Prussian Confederation which formally petitioned Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia, including Danzig, into the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. = Lasting legacy = Monument in Gdańsk When the area was disputed between Weimar Germany and the Second Polish Republic, the Poles recalled the massacre quoting the number of 10,000 murdered.Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych, Poland, Dzieje miast Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: Polska w słowie i obrazach, Nakładem wydawn.

On the monument, called Tym co za Polskość Gdańska (\\"For those who fought/fell/stood up for Gdansk's Polishness\\"), the dates 1308, 1454, 1466 and 1939 are mentioned, relating the events of 1308 to the Thirteen Years' War and World War II.

It is in three movements: #Allegro - Poco largemente - Tempo I #Lento - Piu mosso. In Legendary Mood - Tempo I #Theme and Variations: Allegro - Andante - Tempo I - Epilogue (Sereno) The movement opens with a melodic motive from the clarinets, and the slower, second main motive is introduced almost immediately after (sounding like a quote from the Tragic Overture, Op. 81 by Johannes Brahms). These two motives form a basis for the first subject, which has a very haunting mood, almost looking back on the opening of the fifth symphony. The lyrical second subject is achingly tender, but does show signs of optimism, particularly when it recapitulates at the end of the movement. The second movement is much more serene, almost a relief after the experience of the stormy opening movement. It is in a three part form, alike a one movement symphony, and the mood is somewhat dignified. It closes peacefully to set up the finale. The last movement is a theme and variations, something that Bax had not attempted before, and he makes good work of the gorgeous theme introduced after quite a blustery introduction, which is used for the variations of the main theme. It closes with Bax's shortest epilogue, almost acting as an end to an extraordinary cycle of symphonies, as if to say \\"goodbye\\".

History First licensed in 1960, the station was a 500 watt, four-tower directional station built on an inhabited island. Telephone and electrical services were run to the island, exclusively for the station. A drawbridge was built for convenient transportation. The original owners were Kentucky broadcasters, Bill Betts and Gilmore Nunn, who vacationed in Marathon. In the early 1960s they sold the station to Kentucky financier Garvis Kincaid where it became part of the Bluegrass Broadcasting chain, headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky. Bluegrass sold the station to a former Michigan legislator and local resident, Emil Lockwood. Lockwood retained the station for less than three years before selling to competitors, the Thacker family, who then owned WMUM-FM, a music station in Marathon. The Thackers upgraded the station to 2,500 watts with a two tower directional signal. They sold both the AM and FM stations to Joe Nascone, a local resident formerly from Pennsylvania. While the FCC database states that the station's transmitter tower is located on Boot Key, as well as the transmitter for Radio Marti. Radio Marti is actually on Sister's Creek Island, adjacent to Boot Key and inside the Marathon City limits. As of July 2007, the station's programming consists of news/talk, including syndicated programming of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, G. Gordon Liddy and Bill O'Reilly. The station was most recently owned by Jonathan Smith's Choice Radio Keys Corporation. Due to an inability to pay outstanding debts, the company assigned the licenses of WFFG and sister stations WGMX, WKEY-FM, and WKEZ-FM to a trustee on June 4, 2018 to be sold for the benefit of creditors.

The puppet character was voiced by David Graham in the TV series and the first two films, while Anthony Edwards played the role for the live-action film. Brains is voiced by Kayvan Novak in the CGI remake series Thunderbirds Are Go, which aired in 2015. Conception and development According to series co-creator Sylvia Anderson, Brains was conceived as \\"yet another version of our regular boffin-type characters who had appeared in all our previous series\\". She compares the character to Professor Matthew Matic (of Fireball XL5) and George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed \\"Phones\\" (of Stingray). Brains has also been viewed as an updated version Dr Beaker (of Supercar), an eccentric scientist who similarly stutters. The likeness of the Supermarionation puppet was influenced by the appearance of American actor Anthony Perkins.La Rivière 2009, p. 115. Voice actor David Graham did not base Brains' tones on any person in real life. He explains that Brains' stutter – which he devised himself, without direction from the Andersons or scripts – was a natural evolution of his characterisation: \\"It seems that with clever people the mind works faster than the mouth can speak.\\"Bentley 2005, p. 26. It is likened by Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, writers of What Made Thunderbirds Go! The Authorised Biography of Gerry Anderson, to logical positivism, whereby \\"the mind recognises only unquestionable facts and often appears to work faster than the voice.\\"Archer and Hearn 2002, p. 116. Graham also interpreted the character as being \\"innocent and unsophisticated\\", and possessing qualities of \\"absent- mindedness\\" and \\"vagueness\\".Archer and Hearn 2002, p. 117. Anderson expresses similar views, describing the role as that of \\"a young man pre-occupied and confident with his work and experiments, yet socially unsure of himself\\". A negative effect of the character's delivery was the impact on the pacing of episodes: Anderson remembers that the stutter slowed the action, which potential distributors wanted to \\"move along fast\\", despite \\"bearing in mind that puppet action was slow enough without any speech impediments\\". She concludes that while all concerned were impressed by Graham's \\"original interpretation\\", the stammer proved to be \\"one of those experiments that worked better in the recording studio than on the screen\\". The scriptwriters solved the problem by abbreviating or cutting Brains' lines and limiting the character's appearances, to the extent that by the end of Series Two, his speech impediment had been eliminated completely. With Parker, Brains was Graham's joint favourite voice role for series.Marriott 1993, p. 124. In the mid-1980s, Gerry Anderson proposed to develop a Thunderbirds re-make, T-Force.Bentley 2005, p. 120. As part of the updating of characters, vehicles and settings, Brains' myopia and stutter were to have been removed, and the character re-imagined as an eloquent computer scientist. In the late 1990s, before Jonathan Frakes replaced Peter Hewitt as director of the then- undeveloped live-action film adaptation, co-producer Tim Bevan approached comedian Rowan Atkinson with a view to offering him the role of Brains. Anthony Edwards, who portrayed Brains in the completed 2004 film, enjoyed the role primarily on account of the character's stutter.Starburst Special 2004, p. 27. In an interview for Starburst magazine, Edwards stated that his children \\"made me be absolutely true to the original Brains – it was very important to them.\\" Marit Annen, the film's costume designer, pictured the character as \\"the kind of archetypal forgetful scientist; the only thing that's hi-tech about him is his shoes\\".Starburst Special 2004, p. 39. The glasses that the live-action Brains wears, while intended to be reminiscent of the original \\"pebble lenses\\", were made as smaller and \\"slightly more modern\\" half-frame spectacles. Character biography Born on 14 November 2001 or 2040 in Michigan, United States, Brains was orphaned at the age of 12 when his family was killed in a hurricane. He was eventually adopted by a professor at the University of Cambridge, and discovered later on by Jeff Tracy, founder of International Rescue, while he was lecturing in Paris.Bentley 2005, p. 58.Marriott 1993, p. 125. Brains is a highly-intelligent mechanical and aerospace engineer who is considered to be fifty years ahead of his time, and the world's greatest aircraft designer.Thunderbird 6, 1968; approx 00:30. A highly valued if somewhat absent-minded and socially maladroit member of IR, he designed the Thunderbird machines and other vehicles and facilities used by the organisation and its agents – indeed, much of the hardware and infrastructure. He is also known to invent in his spare time; he once built a chess-playing robot called Braman (which fortuitously serves as an auxiliary computer in the episode \\"Sun Probe\\"). Brains' technical expertise is sometimes required in the field, in which case he usually accompanies the Tracy brothers in Thunderbird 2. Brains has occasionally designed vehicles for organisations outside of International Rescue as a freelance engineer. These include Skythrust (in the episode \\"Alias Mr. Hackenbacker\\") and Skyship One (in the film Thunderbird 6). Such commissions are built under strict security to maintain the secrecy of IR. The character's birth name is not revealed in the series; while working on external projects, Brains uses a pseudonym to protect his identity. For example, he uses the alias \\"Hiram K. Hackenbacker\\" while working on the Skythrust project, and the board that commissions Skyship One knows him only as \\"Mr X\\". In the 2004 film, his actual name is Ray Hackenbacker. Thunderbirds Are Go!, the 2015 reboot series, uses Hiram K. Hackenbacker as Brains's real name. =Appearances= * \\"Trapped in the Sky\\" * \\"Pit of Peril\\" * \\"Terror in New York City\\" * \\"Edge of Impact\\" * \\"Day of Disaster\\" * \\"30 Minutes After Noon\\" * \\"Desperate Intruder\\" * \\"End of the Road\\" * \\"The Uninvited\\" * \\"Sun Probe\\" * \\"Operation Crash-Dive\\" * \\"Vault of Death\\" * \\"The Mighty Atom\\" * \\"City of Fire\\" * \\"The Man From MI.5\\" * \\"Cry Wolf\\" * \\"Danger at Ocean Deep\\" * \\"Move – And You're Dead\\" * \\"Brink of Disaster\\" * \\"Attack of the Alligators!\\" * \\"The Cham-Cham\\" * \\"Security Hazard\\" * \\"Atlantic Inferno\\" * \\"Path of Destruction\\" * \\"Alias Mr. Hackenbacker\\" * \\"Lord Parker's 'Oliday\\" * \\"Ricochet\\" * \\"Give or Take a Million\\" * Thunderbirds Are Go * Thunderbird 6 * Thunderbirds Reception Brains is widely considered to be one of the best-known characters devised for an Anderson series, and is described by Daniel Sperling of the entertainment website Digital Spy as one of a few Thunderbirds characters to \\"have almost become as beloved as the show\\". Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, argues that Brains is the series' \\"third iconic character\\" after Lady Penelope and Parker, and is distinctive for his \\"big, blue-rimmed glasses and stuttering American accent\\".La Rivière 2009, p. 110. Tom Eames of Digital Spy judges Brains to be among the most memorable puppet characters in television, writing that unlike some other series regulars, he is \\"somebody who everyone remembers. If you were going to bring a small group of TV characters on a rocket to start a new world, Brains should be high on the list.\\" Jon Abbott of TV Zone magazine is critical of Brains' status as \\"the stammering, bespectacled genius\\", judging it to be one of a number of dated stereotypes inherent in the series' writing. David Ryan of the website DVD Verdict is bemused by the stutter, arguing that it \\"comes off as slight retardation, or possibly brain damage. (Maybe he's an early version of Rain Man?).\\" Daniel O'Brien comments on the close relationship between Brains and the Tracy family, judging the former to be Jeff's \\"surrogate sixth son\\". Ryan suggests that Brains is to the Tracys as music producer George Martin was to The Beatles. James Gray of the website The Digital Fix considers Brains to be \\"easily the highlight\\" of film sequel Thunderbird 6 (1968), praising the \\"amusing\\" and \\"entertaining\\" scenes in which he destroys rejected prototypes of the eponymous, proposed new vehicle (displaying \\"a side of him we haven't seen before\\"), as well as the character's major role in the rescue of the Skyship One passengers. Critical response to Anthony Edwards' live-action portrayal has generally been negative. Gray is mildly complimentary, arguing that the character is spoiled only by his \\"silly haircut\\", which is considered \\"too mannered to be convincing\\". Although he questions the wisdom of giving the re-imagined Brains a son (Fermat Hackenbacker, played by Soren Fulton), he states that the scenes in which parent and child interact are \\"nicely done, and provide some rare warmth to proceedings\\". Ian Freer of Empire magazine judges Edwards' performance \\"uncomfortable\\", while Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk suggests that Brains and Fermat's \\"'funny' stutters\\" are poor substitutes for \\"real character traits\\". Ira Zimmerman of Minnesota State University, Mankato, in a study of film characters with stammers, states that Edwards' Brains \\"comes off like a wimp – an object of ridicule\\" and is less \\"heroic\\" than the \\"more interesting\\" Fermat. =Popular culture= La Rivière considers the character of Brains to occupy a special place in popular culture. The Independent observes that the name \\"has entered the English language for any high-foreheaded geek with over-sized specs\\", adding that the character was \\"representative of a type. He was the backroom boffin, diffident in speech and uncomfortable (my, those eyes used to roll about) in taking the foreground\\". Alastair Campbell, press secretary to former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, nicknamed Labour politician David Miliband \\"Brains\\" after the Thunderbirds character. In 2004, news magazine The Economist used Brains' image as part of a billboard advertising campaign. In May 2008, a new TV advertisement for Britvic's Drench spring water was launched; it featured a puppet Brains dancing to the Snap! song \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\", with the slogan \\"Brains work best when hydrated\\". The official video proved to be popular on YouTube, where it inspired various remixes. Giles Wilson, writing for BBC News Magazine, praised the film's production values and suggested that it was \\"destined to be the memorable advert of this year\\", comparing it favourably to Cadbury's \\"Gorilla\\" promotions of 2007. BBC Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley considered the advert \\"amazing\\"; Gerry Anderson deemed it \\"brilliant\\" and remarked that the writer should have been awarded for his joke \\"Good for Brains\\". The advert re-appeared in re-cut form, featuring the new slogan \\"Dehydrated brains don't perform well\\", in January 2009.

As of July 2007 he is already contracted 48 years at Feyenoord, which makes him the longest serving employee in Dutch football history. Meijer was born in Rotterdam. In his youth he was confronted with World War II. His father was a boxing coach and physio and Gerard was always allowed to join him. As a result, he started to learn how to massage people and was soon massaging professional boxers like Bep van Klaveren. Meijer joined Feyenoord aged 24 in 1959, just a few seasons after professional football started in the Netherlands. During his spell at the club he has witnessed successes and extremely weak performances from a close range. He saw the team win the 1970 European Cup, the Intercontinental Cup in the same year, the 1974 and 2002 UEFA Cups as well as various Eredivisie and KNVB Cup titles. On the other hand, he saw the club balancing on the edge of bankruptcy more than once. Whether it is Coen Moulijn, Ruud Gullit, Wim Jansen, Willem van Hanegem, Johan Cruijff, Julio Ricardo Cruz, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Dirk Kuyt or John de Wolf, they have all been undergoing massages by Meijer in their way of rehability to perform at their best when needed. Meijer used to be nicknamed \\"The fastest physio on Earth\\". When Meijer ran on the pitch to help an injured player he was always chanted by Het Legioen who made motorcycle noises. In August 2004 Meijer was honoured at the pitch of the Feijenoord Stadion for his efforts in his 45-year anniversary at the club. Former chairman Gerard Kerkum, also a former Feyenoord footballer, was one of the first ever footballers to undergo Meijer's massages. He was the one that gave him flowers in front of the fans. Also Patrick Paauwe gave him some flowers, to show the respect from the current squad in these days. Beside a masseur Meijer has always been an important man for players to tell the problems they were and are facing. He has been asked to write a book about these stories, but as of today he has always denied to do this. The 2008–2009 season was his last as Feyenoord's first team physio, he was followed by Fred Zwang. On Thursday April 29, 2010 Gerard Meijer was appointed as a Member in the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Purpose One of the best known International Maritime Regimes is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS. While UNCLOS is only one of many regimes, or sets of rules, laws, codes and conventions that have been created to regulate the activities of private, commercial and military users of our seas and oceans, it provides the legal framework for further maritime security cooperation. Most maritime regimes, including UNCLOS, have been created through the United Nations International Maritime Organization (IMO) in consultation with its member states, and refer to navigation, resource allocation and ownership, prevention of pollution and environmental protection. The United States has not yet ratified UNCLOS (see United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS) but it does adhere to its conventions, and has been the driving force behind other maritime security initiatives, including PSI, CSI, ISPS Code and counter-piracy agreements to address piracy against commercial shipping in the Gulf of Aden, Horn of Africa region. The United States has also led attempts to expand current bilateral maritime policing, counter narcotics trafficking agreements, whereby regional states in the Caribbean participate in a Caribbean Regional Maritime Agreement (CRA) - (long name: Agreement Concerning Co-operation in Suppressing Illicit Maritime and Air Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in the Caribbean Area). Where maritime security regimes can differ from other maritime regimes, is that they are created to enable effective policing beyond the jurisdictional constraints of the territorial sea, which ranges from to from the high-water mark of a coastal state (see UNCLOS). Complications arise when a navy, coast guard, coastwatch, maritime police force, or other agency wishes to intercept (or 'interdict') vessels suspected of carrying out illegal activities, such as piracy against ships, smuggling or there is potential for an act of terrorism. If a suspect vessel is registered, or 'flagged', with a state other than the state of the pursuing authorities, then in most cases the pursuing authorities must gain the permission of the 'flag' state prior to boarding. If the suspect vessel crosses into the territorial waters of another state, possibly a third state, which is not the home state of the pursuing authorities, then permission must be sought from the territorial state prior to intercepting or boarding. However, if a prior agreement has been arranged with one or more coastal states, then this can simplify and speed up the process and can make the difference between suspects being detained or not. If several states within a maritime region (such as the Caribbean Sea or Southeast Asia) can come to agreement on 'hot pursuit' and boarding of suspect vessels, then this will reduce time that must otherwise be spent seeking permission. UNCLOS, Article 111 states that: \\"The hot pursuit of a foreign ship may be undertaken when the competent authorities of the coastal State have good reason to believe that the ship has violated the law and regulations of that State. Such pursuit must be commenced when the foreign ship or one of its boats is within the internal waters, the archipelagic waters, the territorial sea, or the contiguous zone if the pursuit has not been interrupted.....The right of hot pursuit ceases as soon as the ship pursued enters the territorial sea of its own State or of a third State.\\"  Theory  While there is a broad school of thought and considerable academic literature on 'regimes' (see Regime theory), less is known about Maritime Security Regimes as an academic field, or set of theories in its own right. Another related area that requires further research is Regional Maritime Security Regimes, for while there do exist international regimes such as UNCLOS (1988), SUA (1988), ISPS code (2004) there is a trend toward regionalism in maritime security, and exclusion of a strong hegemony to administer it. The CRA is an example of a comprehensive multilateral regional maritime agreement. the CRA arose out of a need to respond to the growing prevalence of drug trafficking through the Caribbean Sea. Initially bi-lateral agreements between Caribbean states sought to address the delays that occurred when suspects fled into the territorial sea and beyond the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard (USCG). These comprehensive agreements sought, among other things, to allow law enforcement officers of one state to be 'sea-rider' LEDETS aboard vessels of the territorial states to reduce lengthy permission-seeking processes. The CRA refers to existing international convention found within the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988). Article 17 of the UN Drugs Convention states: \\"1. The Parties [states] shall co-operate to the fullest extent possible to suppress illicit traffic by sea, in conformity with the international law of the sea.\\"  History  Maritime Security in its commercial and military forms has been the primary reason for Naval presence in areas with high shipping traffic but low levels of policing. Notable areas have historically included the Caribbean Sea, and currently include piracy on the West Coast of Africa Nigeria, the East Coast of Africa, particularly the Horn of Africa, Gulf of Aden and Somalian Coast; the South China Sea, and until 2007, Southeast Asia's Strait of Malacca and Singapore Strait. Security Regimes were developed during the Cold War, with the SALT I and SALT II but maritime regimes that protect the rights and free passage of commercial and other maritime traffic have been under development since colonial powers sought to protect resources and trade routes from South and Southeast Asia to Europe. Academic literature on Maritime Security Regimes is minimal, although material relating to regional maritime policing, and anti-piracy agreements such as UN Security Resolutions 1816 (2008) and 1846 (2008) suggest this is increasingly significant area of research.

The A8 route runs for 23 kilometres from North Sydney to Mona Vale. The route includes parts of several different roads. The A8 designation replaced Metroad 10 during May 2013, much as the Metroad 10 route designation previously replaced the former State Route 14 designation in December 1998. The A8 is the main transport link through the Northern Beaches district of Sydney. It forms one of only three road connections between the Northern Beaches area and the rest of Sydney. The A8's crossing of Middle Harbour on the Spit Bridge has become infamous as one of the most congested road links in the city, made worse by the regular opening of the bridge to allow boats to pass by. The A8 will eventually connect with the M8 in the Inner West via the Western Harbour Tunnel & Beaches Link, M4–M5 Link, and Rozelle Interchange. Route The A8 starts at the Warringah Freeway (M1) at North Sydney. The A8 route ends at the intersection of Pittwater Road and with Mona Vale Road (A3), at Mona Vale. The A8 follows these roads from (North) to the (South): * Pittwater Road * Condamine Street * Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation * Manly Road * Spit Road * Military Road The majority of the A8 has three lanes in each direction. There are a few sections with only two lanes in each direction. None of the A8 route is a proper freeway, and it has intersections controlled by traffic lights every few blocks. The Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation opened in 1985 to bypass the congested Balgowlah shopping strip, offers 3 kilometres of almost freeway-grade motoring. History Most of the components of the A8 are old roads. The section of Military Road through Cremorne and Mosman was first built in the 1820s. The earliest bridge at The Spit, linking Mosman to Manly, opened in 1923, and was then rebuilt in the late 1950s with new, wider, approach roads on the southern (Spit Road) and northern sides (Manly Road) of the bridge. The newest section of road is the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation, a completely new road built the early 1980s to bypass the congested Balgowlah shopping strip on Sydney Road. The route from North Sydney to Mona Vale was designated as ‘State Route 14’ in 1974, but continued along Barrenjoey Road to Palm Beach unlike the A8. Barrenjoey Road had signplates removed and most of Pittwater Road was re-designated as Metroad 10 in 1998, five years after the first Metroad routes were introduced. Traffic headed south-east on the Warringah Freeway originally had no ability to exit the freeway and enter Falcon Street, so the original Metroad 10 route had a connection further west via the Pacific Highway to Artarmon. When north-facing, tolled, off-ramps were constructed which directly connected the Warringah freeway to Falcon Street from 2007, Metroad 10 route was truncated at that point. The A8 now reflects the final route of Metroad 10. Major intersections Major roads and routes intersected along the A8 ( from south to north ) include: *The commencement of the A8 at the intersection of Falcon Street (A8) with the Warringah Freeway (M1) at North Sydney. *The junction of Spit Road and Military Road, at Mosman *The junction with Sydney Road and, indirectly, to the Wakehurst Parkway, at Seaforth *The junction with Condamine Street, at Balgowlah *The junction with Pittwater Road, at Brookvale *The junction with Warringah Road (A38), at Brookvale *The junction with the Wakehurst Parkway, at North Narrabeen *The junction with Mona Vale Road (A3) at Mona Vale, where the A8 ends See also References Category:Sydney Metroads ","title":"A8 (Sydney)"},{"id":"12244119","text":"Detective Irene Daniels is a fictional character featured in TNT's television police drama series The Closer, portrayed by Gina Ravera.

Lineup The group was initially composed of Benny Ill (born Ben Garner), Jay King, Lev Jnr, Nasis and four other members. The eight were closely associated with the influential drum & bass record label No U Turn, and its UK garage-oriented sister label Turn U On. Garner has since collaborated on the seminal \\"Fat Larry's Skank\\" track, which has been remixed and re-versioned many times by producers including Kode9, as well as collaborating with Hatcha on a number of tracks, DJing at FWD>>, and releasing more straightforward dub as part of the duo Bill & Ben. After a five-year hiatus, Garner returned to Horsepower with new collaborator Jay King, with a 12\\" single, \\"Kingstep/Damn It\\" in 2009 and an LP in November 2010 entitled Quest for the Sonic Bounty, both on Tempa. Sound Early Horsepower releases were resolutely UK garage in sound, but the mainly instrumental, dub versions which were often B-sides of these releases proved to be extremely influential; stripped-down, minimal re-versions, with the emphasis on shuffled, intricate, crisp percussion and subbass. Meanwhile, Horsepower Productions' 12 inches and other similarly minded music experimenting with the garage archetype were staples in Croydon's Big Apple Records, a record shop staffed and frequented by many artists later to become extremely influential in the dubstep and grime genres. In 2002, as interest in the dubstep genre grew, Horsepower Productions released In Fine Style, a collection of earlier 12\\" releases on compact disc accompanied by six new tracks in a double twelve-inch pack. The LP has been described as the \\"origin\\" or \\"birth\\" of dubstep. The duo's influence was acknowledged by the inclusion of several Horsepower Productions tracks on Tempa's 2006 Roots of Dubstep compilation.

He played professional baseball for ten years from 1912 to 1921. A native of Louisiana, Perritt began his career in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals from 1912 to 1914. After signing a contract with a Federal League team in December 1915, he reneged in March 1915 and signed a contract with the New York Giants. He was one of the leading pitchers in the National League from 1914 to 1918, compiling an 81–62 win–loss record and a 2.46 earned run average (ERA) during that period. His best season was 1917 when he helped lead the Giants to the National League pennant with a 17–7 record and a 1.88 ERA. Perritt also briefly played for the Detroit Tigers in 1921. Over the course of 10 major league seasons, he appeared in 256 games and compiled a 92–78 record with a 2.89 ERA. Early years Perritt was born in Arcadia, Louisiana, in 1891. He was six feet, two inches tall and weighed 168 pounds. He batted and threw right handed. He played semi-pro baseball in 1910 for a team in Homer, Louisiana, and in 1911 for a team in Minden, Louisiana. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= Perritt began his professional baseball career in 1912 in the Cotton States League playing for the Vicksburg Hill Billies and the Greenwood Scouts. He compiled an 18–18 record in that league. =St. Louis Cardinals= Perritt joined the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1912 and compiled a 1–1 record and 3.19 ERA in six games in the closing weeks of the season. In 1913, Perritt appeared in 36 games for the Cardinals, 21 as a starter, and compiled a 6–14 record and 5.25 ERA. Perritt emerged as one of the leading pitchers in the National League during the 1914 Cardinals season. He appeared in 41 games, 32 as a starter, and compiled a 16–13 record. He led the National League with 15 batters hit by a pitch and ranked among the National League leaders with a 2.36 ERA (eighth), .552 win percentage (10th), 93 bases on balls (eighth), a 118 adjusted ERA+ rating (ninth), and a 3.7 wins above replacement (WAR) rating (10th). =New York Giants= Perritt was reportedly \\"dissatisfied with affairs in St. Louis\\", and after the 1914 season, he signed a three-year contract to play for the Pittsburgh Rebels of the Federal League. Perritt said at the time that he preferred to play for $2,000 a year for the Rebels than $10,000 a year for the Cardinals. However, New York Giants manager John McGraw entered into a trade with the Cardinals for rights to Perritt and induced Perritt to renege on his contract with the Federal League. Federal League officials reacted angrily to the Giants' signing of Perritt, noting that it \\"presaged a general renewal of the baseball war\\" for which the Federal League had set aside a $100,000 war fund. During the 1915 season, Perritt appeared in 35 games and compiled a 12-18 record with a 2.66 ERA. Perritt's record in 1915 led one writer to brand him a \\"gold brick\\", criticizing Perritt's inability to complete games (he had 16 complete games in 29 starts in 1915) and asserting that he \\"pitched a brand of baseball so weird that it became a joke around the circuit.\\" In 1916, Perritt appeared in 40 games, 29 as a starter and had 17 complete games. He compiled an 18-11 record with a 2.62 ERA. On September 9, 1916, he won both games in a double-header against the defending National League champion Philadelphia Phillies. Playing in front of 37,000 spectators in New York, Perritt gave up only one run in 18 innings. Perritt had the best season of his career in 1917 as he helped the Giants win the National League pennant. That year, Perritt appeared in 35 games, compiled a 17–7 record and ranked among the National League leaders with a .708 winning percentage (third) and a 1.88 ERA (third). Despite his strong performance in the regular season, Perritt did not start any games in the 1917 World Series against the Chicago White Sox. He appeared in relief in three World Series games, giving up two earned runs in 8-1/3 innings for a 2.16 ERA in the World Series. In 1918, Perritt posted his third consecutive season with at least 17 wins. He appeared in 35 games in 1918 and compiled an 18-13 record with a 2.74 ERA. During the three seasons from 1916 to 1918, Perritt appeared in 110 games for the Giants, started 86 games, threw 50 complete games, and compiled a 53-31 record with a 2.43 ERA. However, Perritt developed a reputation for being troublesome during his tenure with the Giants. One sportswriter in 1917 observed: \\"For let it be known Poll Perritt is a temperamental cuss. Just what he is going to do nobody ever knows. . . . The great trouble with Perritt heretofore has been failure to look upon his profession in all the seriousness characteristic of genius.\\" Perritt held out at the start of the 1919 season, suggesting he may leave baseball to devote his full attention to oil wells that he owned in Texas. In mid-May, John McGraw finally persuaded him to return. However, Peritt was unable to get into shape and pitched only 19 innings during the 1919 season with a career-high 7.11 ERA. He quit the team and went home in August, and a newspaper account at the time reported that Perritt \\"had been practically useless all season, having been unable to get into condition.\\" Despite having appeared in only 19 innings and having left the team early, Perritt appealed to the National Commission for a full share of the Giants' prize money for finishing in second place. The New York players were not pleased with Perritt's action, but agreed to a settlement, giving Perritt a half share. After the 1919 season, Perritt announced that he was retiring from baseball to attend to his oil interests. Perritt did appear in four games late in the 1920 season with the San Antonio Bears in the Texas League. He was recalled to the Giants on September 24, 1920, and appeared in eight games, all as a relief pitcher, at the end of the 1920 season. Despite the lack of playing time, Perritt compiled a career best 1.80 ERA in 15 innings pitched for the 1920 Giants. On October 22, 1920, Perritt also pitched a 2–0 shutout in an exhibition game in Cuba against the Havana team. One writer, after watching Perritt pitch in Cuba, wrote: \\"Perritt's arm seems to be as good as it ever was and I look forward to him to be a help to the Giants next year.\\" Perritt returned to the Giants in the spring of 1921. He appeared in five games for the club, compiling a 2–0 record despite an ERA that rose from 1.80 in 1920 to 3.86 in 11-2/3 innings pitched in 1921. =Detroit and minor leagues= In June 1921, the Giants sold Perritt to the Detroit Tigers. He appeared in four games and pitched 13 innings for the Tigers, compiling a 1–0 record and a 4.85 ERA. He was granted an unconditional release by the Tigers on July 11, 1921. After being released by the Tigers, Perritt signed with the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. He finished the 1921 season with the St. Joseph Saints in the Western League. Later years As late as 1923, Perritt was still playing semi-pro baseball with the Cleary Athletic Club in Los Angeles. In 1925, he served as a player-manager for a team in Covina, California. After retiring from baseball, Perritt became an oil operator in Louisiana. He lived in Arcadia, Louisiana, and died in 1947 at age 56 in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was buried at the Arcadia Cemetery.

Fritz received his initial training at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia and has been working for the FBI in Los Angeles for the three years prior to Brenda Johnson's arrival in Los Angeles to become an LAPD Deputy Chief. Fritz is an old friend of Brenda's and has known her since at least her time in Washington, D.C. Fritz and Brenda were married in the last episode of Season Four of The Closer.The Closer (TC):s4 ep15 \\"Double Blind\\" Fritz not only provides her with access to FBI resources and inside information when local resources are unavailable, he also provides emotional grounding for the passionate Brenda, who can get overly caught up in her investigations. He later continues to aid the Major Crimes Division (MCD) as their FBI liaison after Johnson leaves MCD and, during season 3 of Major Crimes, he retires from the FBI to become Deputy Chief of Special Operations Bureau, covering LAPD's SWAT, K-9, Air, Mounted and other special units. Character history Extremely smart and well-liked, Howard has many law enforcement connections and knows how to track down information for criminal cases. He is a true gentleman. Throughout The Closer, he would do practically anything for Brenda. He is also very patient and tolerates her work addiction; for example, he is willing to wait hours or even days for her to wrap up a case so that he can see her. When Brenda's mother came to town as the two were moving in together, Fritz suffered a charade for Brenda's sake, and kept all his possessions in a U-Haul trailer so her mother wouldn't find out. He is extremely kind, almost to a fault, when it comes to Brenda, and he is so supportive and loving to her that he might even overstep professional bounds and risk his career to help her with cases. He endures ribbing from his fellow agents as a result of the assistance he gives to the Major Crimes Division (MCD), formerly the Priority Homicide Division, the LAPD division headed by Brenda. In the third season Brenda learns that Fritz had two DUIs some years earlier, and is a recovering alcoholic. In Major Crimes, when asked if Howard was a bureaucrat or \\"one of the good guys\\", the squad stated he was one of the good guys and not so bad for an FBI agent. Howard continues as FBI Liaison to the LAPD in the series Major Crimes. In season 3, Assistant Chief of Operations Russell Taylor suggests Howard for the job of Deputy Chief of the Special Operations Bureau of the LAPD, pointing out that he is an excellent candidate whose 27 years with the FBI means that he could easily retire with his full pension and start a second career.Major Crimes (MC):s3 ep7 \\"Two Options\\" After helping resolve a hostage situation, Howard ultimately accepts the job and spends his last days as an FBI agent helping solve a case,MC:s3 ep9 \\"Sweet Revenge\\" before officially taking up the job,MC:s3 ep10 \\"Zoo Story\\" However, Howard has a heart attack that he keeps secret from all but Tao, including his wife Brenda. This heart attack requires him to wear an external pacemaker. During season 5, Deputy Chief Howard temporarily serves as Acting Assistant Chief of Operations, after Taylor is murdered.MC:s5 ep11 \\"White Lies, Part 1\\" In this duty, Howard continues to work alongside the MCD while the LAPD works on a permanent replacement for Taylor. When Commander Leo Mason is promoted to Assistant Chief of Operations, Howard is able to resume his preferred role as Deputy Chief of the Special Operations Bureau.MC:s5 ep21 \\"Shockwave, Part 2\\" He is also aware of Sharon's impending promotion to the open Commander rank and congratulates her as the last person to call Sharon \\"Captain\\".

Col. Harrison Jack (Ret.) and former Royal Lao Army Major General Vang Pao, among others conspired in June 2007 to obtain large amounts of heavy weapons and ammunition in allegedly planning an attempt to overthrow the Communist government of Laos in violation of the Neutrality Act. The charges were ultimately dropped and the case helped serve to further highlight, instead, major human rights violations by the Lao government against minority Hmong and Laotian refugees and political and religious dissidents. History On June 4, 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice announced they had arrested ten individuals in connection with the alleged plot as part of a joint investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Joint Terrorism Task Force. The operation, dubbed \\"Operation Tarnished Eagle,\\" alleges Lt. Col. Harrison Jack (Ret.), former Royal Lao Army Major Generals Vang Pao, Lo Cha Thao, Youa True Vang, Hue Vang, Chong Vang Thao, Seng Vue, Chu Lo, and Lo Thao conspired in June 2007 to obtain scores of AK-47 assault rifles, ground-to-air Stinger missiles, M72 LAW rockets, AT-4 anti-tank missiles, mines, rockets, explosives and smoke grenades in allegedly planning an attempt to overthrow the government of Laos in violation of the Neutrality Act. On June 14, Dang Vang was also arrested in connection to the alleged plot. In an affidavit by Graham Barlowe, a group supervisor of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, it is alleged that at the time of Vang's arrest, he admitted preparing the operations plan. After initially denying bail, the U.S. federal judge ultimately reversed the bail decision, granting Vang Pao and the other defendants bail, even while labeling all of them flight risks, given their access to significant financial resources and private airplanes. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lead agent has also stated in a court affidavit that \\"probable cause exists to believe\\" that former Wisconsin State Senator Gary George was part of the conspiracy. On April 23, 2008, it was reported that U.S. Magistrate Judge Dale A. Drozd would hear arguments in November for motions seeking information U.S. intelligence agencies might have on the alleged coup plotters, including whether the government has intercepted electronic communication between Hmong in the United States and Laos. The defendants' lawyers argued that the case against all of their clients was spurious at best. \\"The case cannot proceed [because] the process has been so corrupted by the government's misconduct that there can never be any confidence in the validity of the charge,\\" said Mark Reichel, one of the defense attorneys involved in the case. \\"[W]hile the [prosecution] tries to portray the 'conspiracy' as a dangerous and sophisticated military plan, it cannot refute the extensive evidence demonstrating otherwise – from the agent's informing the so-called conspirators that they would need an operational plan; to his providing a map of the region when they couldn't procure a useful one; to his explanation of what GPS was (including that it requires batteries); to the so-called conspirators' inability to finance the operation.\\" Mr. Philip Smith (Phillip Smith or Phil Smith), General Vang Pao's long-time political, foreign policy and public relations adviser, as well as family friend, urged the U.S. government to drop the charges against Vang Pao and the defendants, especially given Vang Pao's and the Hmong's role in support of U.S. national security interests during the Vietnam War as well as the Lao communist government's egregious human rights violations. According to human rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United League for Democracy in Laos and the Lao Human Rights Council, Laos engaged in military attacks and campaign of starvation against the Hmong people during the period of the alleged coup plot under the current Pathet Lao and Marxist government. Smith and The Center for Public Policy Analysis (CPPA), in cooperation with a bipartisan coalition of Members of the United States Congress organized and co-hosted events in Washington, D.C., Library of Congress and Capitol Hill regarding serious human rights violations in Laos, including special sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos where Members of the U.S. Congress and other human rights organizations, human rights advocates, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and policy experts testified, including Amnesty International, Kerry and Kay Danes, the Lao Veterans of America, Inc. and others. Smith, the CPPA, Amnesty International, public policy experts and independent journalists provided important research and information to Members of Congress and U.S. and international policymakers in Washington, D.C., regarding the Lao military's persecution and killing of Hmong and Laotian civilians, political asylum seekers and refugees and political and religious dissident groups, including Hmong resistance groups hiding in the jungles and mountains of Laos. Religious freedom issues were also researched and discussed, including the Lao and Socialist Republic of Vietnam security forces persecution, arrest and imprisonment of dissident Laotian and Hmong Christians, Buddhist and Animist religious believers in Laos. Reports by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom were discussed regarding religious freedom violations by the Lao and Vietnam-backed Lao military in Laos. Research and information was also provided about the plight of three Hmong-American citizens from St. Paul, Minnesota, including Hakit Yang, who were arrested, and later imprisoned by Lao security forces in Vientiane's notorious Phonthong Prison before they disappeared in Laos. Philip Smith told the Los Angeles Times, the New York Sun and others that the U.S. Government would be putting itself on trial for betraying the Hmong people, if it proceeded in prosecuting Vang Pao and the other Hmong leaders.Bailey, Eric and Tran, My-Thuan, Los Angeles Times, (19 September 2009), \\"Federal charges dropped against Hmong leader Vang Pao\\" http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/19/local/me-vang-pao19/2 Dropping of charges  On September 18, 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, saying that \\"continued prosecution of this defendant is no longer warranted,\\" and announcing in a press release that the federal government was permitted to consider \\"the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted.” On January 10, 2011, the federal government dropped all charges against the remaining defendants. \\"Based on the totality of the circumstances in the case, the government believes, as a discretionary matter, that continued prosecution of defendants is no longer warranted,\\" according to court documents. Reaction Vang Pao's arrest and a preliminary decision by a U.S. federal judge to deny bail to Vang Pao and the other defendants sparked huge Hmong protest rallies in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and other states. As of early 2008, pressure built on California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and U.S. President George W. Bush to issue pardons in the case, given the defendants' historical alliance with U.S. interests in Southeast Asia.Magagnini, Stephen and Walsh, Denny.

Species There are currently four recognized species in this genus: * Corumbataia britskii Ferreira & Ribeiro, 2007 * Corumbataia cuestae Britski, 1997 * Corumbataia tocantinensis Britski, 1997 * Corumbataia veadeiros Carvalho, 2008 Description These species range in size from about 2.7-3.8 centimetres (1.1-1.5 in) SL. C. cuestae and C. tocantinensis were described to be differentiated by counts of premaxillary and dentary teeth. However, they also differ in color pattern, as the unbranched caudal fin rays of C. britskii and C. tocantinensis lack the striped pattern present in C. cuestae. Corumbataia species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males differ from females by presenting a developed urogenital papillae posterior to the anus, a skin fold at the dorsal portion of the pelvic fin spine, and a much longer pelvic fin spine that extends over the first anal fin ray. In C. britskii, males also differ from females by having four white blotches on the caudal fin, two at the dorsal lobe and two at the ventral lobe. Females, on the other hand, present only two white blotches, one on each lobe.

She was also a founding member of HAG Theater, the first all-lesbian theater company in the US. Politics Davis was a founder of the Mattachine Society of the Niagara Frontier in the first quarter of 1970. She eventually became President of the organization. In the 1970s, Davis organized \\"Legislative Night\\", at which local candidates for public office, for the first time in Buffalo political history, answered questions and sought endorsements. She was a regular lecturer on the subject of human sexuality to preceptors and medical students at the University at Buffalo (U.B.), and also organized workshops and study groups. Davis marched and spoke at the first gay rights rally at the New York State Capitol in 1971, and participated in the original effort to lobby that state's legislature on behalf of the gay rights movement. In 1972, she became the first openly lesbian delegate elected to a major political convention when she was elected to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Miami, Florida. At the DNC, Davis was the first lesbian to urge the party to include gay rights as part of the 1972 Democratic Party platform. Davis became a member of the Democratic Committee, and worked within the party for the acceptance of gays and lesbians. As part of the Political Action Committee of Mattachine, she confronted the Buffalo Vice Squad on the issue of entrapment and gay bar raids.

It presents the story of a woman who suffers from a split personality and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The film mainly deals with issues such as schizophrenia and hallucination. The plot was inspired from a book that Desai read years before he conceptualized the film. Plot The story begins with Sudha and Anand getting engaged. To celebrate, Anand throws a party and promises Sudha that he will pick her up. Anand fails to appear and Sudha drives to his estate. She gets stuck in the rain and knocks on the door of a nearby house. There she discovers the body of a girl. Suddenly she senses that she is being attacked. In the struggle, she falls from the roof. While unconscious, she is admitted to a hospital. When she returns home, she describes what she experienced that night, but no one believes her. She never recovers from the experience. Later, she starts a fight with someone in her imagination and tries to kill that person. A psychiatrist fails to bring Sudha out of her mental state. Her fiancé also tries to bring her to a normal condition. The psychiatrist later believes Sudha when she says a person in a TV program is the killer. He does some research, finds the house where Sudha was attacked, and takes her there, along with her family. Sudha is clear about what she saw that night: she saw the body of a girl and has the button of a dress as evidence. When they arrive at the house, she does not find the body. She discovers that the person whom she believes attacked her on that night is deaf and blind, that the person who was following her and later attacked her was a relative of the residents of that house and that the girl who died had gotten engaged to him prior to her death. He explains the reason he followed her was to describe the truth he knew to their family. Now a big question arises in her mind as the persons whom she saw and attacked both are innocent. She finds a tie pin in a corner of the house and later identifies it as the one belonging to Anand. When she goes to recover it at the house, she encounters Anand, who is there to retrieve it. When she confronts him, he explains the reason behind his involvement in the murder. In a flashback, Anand is hurrying through the rain to pick up Sudha, when he hits and kills a schoolboy. When he buries the body, a girl sees the incident, a girl whom he unintentionally killed. As is explained, he was bound to do this by 'ill fortune'. The mystery unfolds as he explains he is the person who joined Sudha in the hospital and disposed of the body of the girl. After admitting this to Sudha, Anand attempts to kill her, but eventually ends up committing suicide instead. Then, after everything seems to have been resolved, it is revealed that Sudha's friend Maya, who visited her a few times during the film, is also a figment of Sudha's imagination. In fact Sudha has been hallucinating Maya since her childhood and has made up her whole life story, including Maya having a daughter who also visits Sudha. The psychiatrist explains that Sudha has a positive mind which includes positive characters like Maya and a negative mind, where she had placed Prashant. When Sudha gets home, she sees Anand in her room and screams, leading us to believe that she has now placed Anand in her negative mind and he will now haunt her.

But Stills left the tapes in the studio and eventually considered them lost. When the studio was about to close in 1978, musician Joe Colasurdo, who was rehearsing there, was told by the owner that he could take away any tapes he wanted to before they cleared the place out.

Colasurdo began attempting to get the masters safely back into Stills's hands, an undertaking that took 25 years.

The Jews of Rhodes prospered until the persecutions of Italian Fascism began in the 1930s, and at its peak the population of the Jewish quarter was more than 4,000. Geography and features La Juderia is located in the eastern part of the Old City of Rhodes, near a pier used by cruise ships. It is primarily centered on the Dossiadou Street where the Kahal Shalom Synagogue, the lone remaining Jewish house of worship on the island of the six that once stood, is located, along with the Jewish Museum of Rhodes. Other features in the quarter include the Square of the Martyred Jews, which pays tribute to the Jews of Rhodes who died in the Holocaust, located near the heart of the neighborhood, the Alliance Israélite Universelle school, the former site of the Kahal Grande Synagogue, and a number of plaques throughout the quarter in Ladino, Hebrew and Italian.

World War II North Atlantic operations Assigned to the vital duty of escorting convoys between the United States and the Mediterranean, Calcaterra made eight round trips between 13 February 1944 and 10 June 1945. The ships she guarded provided the men and equipment which insured the success of the invasions of Italy and southern France. Twice the escort vessel met the challenge of enemy opposition when she depth charged a suspected submarine contact and fired on two aircraft. Her alert action helped prevent damage or loss to the ships under convoy. Transfer to the Pacific Fleet On 9 July 1946 Calcaterra headed for the Pacific to tackle a new job, but the war ended shortly before her arrival at Pearl Harbor. She lifted passengers back to the west coast, then sailed on to the Atlantic. Calcaterra was placed out of commission in reserve at Green Cove Springs, Florida on 1 May 1946. Reclassified DER-390 on 28 October 1954, Calcaterra was converted to a radar picket ship at Norfolk, Virginia, and recommissioned on 12 September 1955.

The pickets north of Cuba, Dog Rocks, were 30 days out, two days in Key West or Miami, 30 days out then 28 days in Newport, year after year. On many pickets the ship was used as a halfway point for people escaping from Cuba. They were fed then picked up by the Coast Guard. When the ship hit heavy seas headed south for a picket the forward 3 inch gun was ripped off the deck and thrown up onto the 01 level and the forward spaces were flooded. The gun was lashed down, the deck covered with beams and canvas, the water pumped out and the ship proceeded south. About a month later the ship was repaired at a private yard in Boston.

This is the first television adaptation of the novel. Fanny Hill was broadcast in October 2007 on BBC Four, in two episodes. Fanny Hill tells the story of a young country girl (Rebecca Night) who is lured into prostitution in 18th century London.  Plot  Fanny Hill (Rebecca Night) begins telling her story as a young woman who was born to poor but honest parents. She became orphaned after her parents died of small pox. She has become alone on the streets knowing nobody, and with nowhere to go. She stumbles upon her friend Esther Davies, (Emma Stansfield) while at her parents grave, who brings her to join a group of \\"working girls\\" under the madam, Mrs. Brown. Fanny accepts, out of naivety. When she arrives, she meets Phoebe (Carli Norris) with whom she experiences her first sexual encounter and where she discovered her interest in being a woman of pleasure. Fanny soon discovers she has her first client, Mr. Croft (Philip Jackson), who she expected to be young, handsome and rich. Upon meeting him, she discovered that he was rich, but she also found he was old, repulsive, and forcing himself onto her virtue. To no avail, Mr. Croft left in a storm of dust, demanding his money back. It is then that Fanny fully understands her purpose, and the value of her virtue at Mrs. Brown's. At a party later that afternoon, she becomes the center of attention because she had something that no other girl still had, her maidenhead. She meets Mr. H (Hugo Speer) for the first time, who was seemingly uninterested at the time because of her lack of experience. She was whisked away quickly, but not before being spotted by Charles Standing (Alex Robertson) who was immediately in love with Fanny and offered to take her away. After a night of dreaming of Mr. Standing, Fanny goes searching for Charles only to find him asleep downstairs. She accepts his offer to take her away, and they leave immediately. Cast * Rebecca Night as Fanny Hill *Alex Robertson as Charles Standing * Alison Steadman as Mrs. Brown * Hugo Speer as Mr H * Samantha Bond as Mrs Cole * Carli Norris as Phoebe *Joanna Miller as Emma *Richard Riddell as William * Philip Jackson as Mr Croft * Edward Hardwicke as Mr Goodyear * Kayleigh Folcarelli as Florence * Emma Stansfield as Esther Davies * Ruth Sheen as Mrs. Jones * Louisa Clein as Susan * Claire Murphy as Louisa Production On 30 December 2005, Hannah Jones from the Western Mail reported that Andrew Davies would start writing a television adaptation of John Cleland's 18th century novel Fanny Hill the following year. Davies called the project \\"a labour of love\\", but thought the novel was entertaining and perfect for his style of adaptation, as it contains \\"some very racy bits\\". In May 2006, Ben Dowell from The Guardian stated that Fanny Hill had been commissioned by BBC Fiction Controller Jane Tranter, and it would be produced by Sally Head through her own production company. Davies admitted to having doubts as to whether a television adaptation would ever be commissioned. He expressed his delight at introducing a new audience to the novel, while executive producer Eleanor Moran commented \\"Andrew's adaptation brings out the joie de vivre of the novel, and is full of his trademark good humour and naughty wit.\\" Fanny Hill was directed by James Hawes, who previously directed Davies's The Chatterley Affair. Hawes shot between five and eight minutes of screentime in a day, which was double the norm. He said it was a challenging shoot because of the limited budget. Hawes explained that the budget was half what it would have been if the show aired on BBC One, forcing the crew to think outside of the box. Filming lasted for four weeks. While Fanny Hill had been adapted for several films, the miniseries marked the first time the novel had been adapted for television. Fanny Hill aired as part of BBC Four's 18th century season and was accompanied by two documentaries, including The Curse of Success which told the story of Cleland and how he believed Fanny Hill ruined his reputation. 70 actresses auditioned for the role of Fanny, this was cut down to eight and then two. Upon learning she had an audition for Fanny Hill, Night went and purchased the book. She was in the first group of actresses that were seen for the part. Producer Nigel Marchant said Night stood out and called her a natural in the part. Actor Alex Robertson was already in mind for the part of Charles, but his casting was not confirmed until they had cast Night as Fanny. A couple of male actors read with Night and Robertson said that he had to go through two auditions. Producers noted that he had the right chemistry with Night. Reception The first episode of Fanny Hill gave BBC Four its biggest ever audience when it was watched by 1.1 million viewers. It had a 5.3 per cent audience share, outperforming other digital competitors. The second episode also had an audience of 1.1 million, with a 5.2 per cent share. The Guardian's Nancy Banks-Smith gave the serial a positive review, claiming that Fanny Hill \\"was unexpectedly fresh and charming\\". Banks-Smith asserted that viewers would enjoy it, adding \\"And, if you don't, it's only two episodes long, so you won't dislike it for long.\\" Matt Warman from The Daily Telegraph was disappointed that Fanny was \\"not as conspicuously erudite as Cleland's novel\\", but praised Davies for giving her \\"real emotional depth\\". Hermione Eyre, writing for The Independent, thought the miniseries \\"was more authentic than any period drama\\" she had seen on television that year and she called it \\"good-humoured\\". Eyre added that her only problem with Davies's adaptation was a lack of little details found in the novel. Rachel Cooke from the New Statesman questioned whether Davies was \\"spread too thinly\\", as she was disappointed in the adaptation. She stated \\"All the sex was there, but Fanny (Rebecca Night) herself did not get to describe it, which meant that the joy of the book – it is her unrepentant lasciviousness that distinguishes her from, say, Moll Flanders – was lost.\\" For her work on the show, Lucinda Wright earned a nomination for Best Costume Design at the 2008 British Academy Television Craft Awards.  Differences between the novel and adaptation  There are several differences between the text and the tv serial. In the serial, the man who Mrs. Brown first arranges to take Fanny's maidenhead turns out to be Charles' father, while in the text, the two men are not related. Also in the serial, Fanny is caught with William by Mr. H - during their first sexual encounter. In regards to Mr. H-, he appears multiple times in the BBC adaptation. In the novel, Mr. H- appears at Mrs. Brown's brothel as well as the room that Fanny stays in after she leaves the brothel. However, there is no mention of Mr. H reappearing in Fanny's life at Mrs. Cole's (basically ordering for the arrest of the prostitutes for having a secret brothel) as shown in the serial. In this BBC adaptation, Fanny Hill's on camera moments are direct in nature after the events she experienced, unlike the novel's epistolary, first-person account of her adventures to the unnamed \\"Madam.\\" The portrayal of Fanny's first-person narrative on screen takes away from the whimsical and sensible aspect of written letters that give depth the image of Fanny as a poor girl from the country living the life of a prostitute. Within the novel, a man referred to as the \\"good natured Dick\\" by Fanny and the girls at Mrs. Cole's brothel, has been entirely replaced in the BBC film adaptation. Instead of being a man who appears to be mentally handicapped, the \\"good natured Dick\\" has been replaced instead by a man who is sickly and ends up living with the girls in the brothel until his death. This raises the question in regards to why this change may have been made to show an individual with sickness, rather than one with mental disability. The end of the BBC adaptation has Fanny Hill coming home in a carriage when a man on horseback (revealed to be Charles) rides up beside the carriage and stops it. Fanny Hill and Charles then embrace and the movie soon comes to a close by showing Fanny narrating her happiness that follows. In the novel, Fanny is in her house and doesn't believe that she will see Charles ever again when, one day, there is a knock on the door in bad weather and two men ask to come in. One of the men turns out to be Charles and Fanny quickly embraces him. Unlike the film adaptation, the text continues after this scene with Fanny and Charles catching up. Shortly after, they engage in a string of sexual acts together that takes up most of the ending. At the end of both the text and the show, Fanny wraps up her experiences by remarking on pleasure and the morality of her situation.

The zoo has over 400 animals, making it the largest zoo in Atlantic Canada. In 2008, the zoo was rated fourth on a list of Canada's top ten zoos. The zoo has been accredited member of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) since 1993. History The Magnetic Hill Zoo began as the Magnetic Hill Game Farm in 1953. Originally, the game farm was home to orphaned and injured indigenous species like owls, bears, and deer. The city of Moncton took over the park in 1979 and began acquiring more exotic species which served as a catalyst for the renaming the farm to Magnetic Hill Zoo. In 1995, the zoo began a expansion called the African Oasis. At the same time, the zoo also expanded by adding the Primate Conservation Centre, frog bog, the koi pond, bird garden, the Camel-Zebra exhibit, and a children's playground. In 1997–98, the Insectarium exhibit, a new entrance building, and new food facilities were built. The bears were moved to a new exhibit, which permitted them to live in a natural habitat for the first time. The zoo's education programs received an Achievement Award from the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums. A new reptile house exhibit, known as the Ecodome, was opened in 2003. The Ecodome was built on the site of the former bear \\"pit\\". The Ecodome was awarded the Environmental Enrichment Award by CAZA. Exhibits for the barbary sheep and bison were also completed. A new expanded Education Centre with three classrooms, washrooms, an office, kitchen, first aid room, and Discovery Centre were added in 2003. Between 2003 and 2004 exhibits were expanded or refurbished, including habitats for the otters, wolves, watusi, and eland. A deer contact area was constructed. In 2005, construction began on the Pridelands exhibit, a habitat for lions and ostrich. The exhibit's grand opening was held in July 2006 and won the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums Environmental Enrichment Award for the exhibit. A new food concession stand was also renovated in 2005 and the zoo was awarded the New-Brunswick Top Attraction Status. In 2006, significant upgrades were made to the walking path system and signage in order to make the zoo more accessible to the public. In 2008, a new Cougar Country Exhibit was built which was awarded the zoos third CAZA Environmental Enrichment Award. In 2009, a new Jaguar Exhibit was built to resemble the Cougar Country Exhibit built the previous year. The zoo's animal collection was expanded to include mandrills, a colobus monkey, and two African lion cubs. Because of the continued successful breeding program of the zoo's black and white ruffed lemurs, the construction of a new enclosure for these monkeys was started. The former Insectarium exhibit was renovated and reopened as The Container. Friends of the Zoo The zoo is supported heavily by a fund- raising organization, Friends of the Zoo, which was founded in 1989 by Shirley Dingley, Deborah Fisher, Bruce Dougan, and Carolyn Dunlop. Friends of the Zoo focus primarily on raising funds to improve animal habitats at the zoo.Friends of the Zoo Animals Two ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) at the Magnetic Hill Zoo. river otters (Lontra canadensis) at the Magnetic Hill Zoo.

The TP63 gene was discovered 20 years after the discovery of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and along with p73 constitutes the p53 gene family based on their structural similarity. Despite being discovered significantly later than p53, phylogenetic analysis of p53, p63 and p73, suggest that p63 was the original member of the family from which p53 and p73 evolved.  Function  Tumor protein p63 is a member of the p53 family of transcription factors. p63 -/- mice have several developmental defects which include the lack of limbs and other tissues, such as teeth and mammary glands, which develop as a result of interactions between mesenchyme and epithelium. TP63 encodes for two main isoforms by alternative promoters (TAp63 and ΔNp63). ΔNp63 is involved in multiple functions during skin development and in adult stem/progenitor cell regulation. In contrast, TAp63 has been mostly restricted to its apoptotic function and more recently as the guardian of oocyte integrity. Recently, two new functions have been attributed to TAp63 in heart development and premature aging. In mice, p63 is required for normal skin development via direct transcription of the membrane protein PERP. TP63 can also regulate PERP expression with TP53 in human cancer.  Clinical significance  TP63 mutations underlie several malformation syndromes that include cleft lip and/or palate as a hallmark feature. Mutations in the TP63 gene are associated with ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft syndrome in which a midline cleft lip is a common feature, cleft lip/palate syndrome 3 (EEC3); ectrodactyly (also known as split-hand/foot malformation 4 (SHFM4)); ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (AEC) or Hay–Wells syndrome in which a midline cleft lip is also a common feature, Acro–dermato–ungual–lacrimal–tooth syndrome (ADULT); limb-mammary syndrome; Rap-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS); and orofacial cleft 8. p63 staining on prostate cancer tissue using antibody clone IHC063 Both cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and cleft palate only features have been seen to segregate within the same family with a TP63 mutation. Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells have been produced from patients affected by EEC syndromes by cell reprogramming. The defective epithelial commitment could be partially rescued by a small therapeutic compound. = Vulvar cancer = TP63 has been observed overexpressed in Vulvar Squamous Cell Carcinoma samples, in association with hypermethylation-Induced inactivation of the IRF6 tumor suppressor gene. Indeed, mRNA levels of TP63 tested higher in Vulvar cancer samples when compared with those of normal skin and preneoplastic vulvar lesions, thus underscoring an epigenetic cross-link between IRF6 gene and the oncogene TP63.  Diagnostic utility  p63 immunostaining has utility for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, differentiating prostatic adenocarcinoma (the most common type of prostate cancer) and benign prostatic tissue; normal prostatic glands stain with p63 (as they have basal cells), while the malignant glands in prostatic adenocarcinoma (which lacks these cells) do not. P63 is also helpful in distinguishing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma from small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. P63 should be strongly stained in poorly differentiated squamous cell, but negative in small cell or adenocarcinoma.  Interactions  TP63 has been shown to interact with HNRPAB. It also activates IRF6 transcription through the IRF6 enhancer element. Regulation There is some evidence that the expression of p63 is regulated by the microRNA miR-203 and USP28 at protein level  See also  *AMACR - another marker for prostate adenocarcinoma  References   Further reading      *  External links   GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal Defects-Cleft Lip/Palate Syndrome or AEC Syndrome, Hay-Wells Syndrome.

Records in 2006 after the band's debut album, Tragedy Rocks, sold 35,000 copies worldwide. The band decided to self-finance their second album, titled Secrets of the Witching Hour, and make it available to download for free from its website. The album was released on 30 April 2007, almost two weeks before its original projected release date. Within the first 24 hours, the album was downloaded more than 5,000 times. Starting on June 4, a CD version was offered for sale on a mail-order basis from the band's website. Critical reception In a review of the album for NME, Jess Colman wrote: \\"Although slightly ruined by the frequent and unnecessary Americanised monologues, the record’s Technicolor fusion of dark, sombre tunes and vibrant, upbeat tracks proudly pushes aside any doubts.\\" Francis Jones of Hot Press said that on this album, \\"The Crimea manage to fashion epic tales from everyday material, intimate scenarios instilled with the heroic bombast of Greek myth, or a sense of tragedy befitting the Bard.\\" Andrew Iliff of Stylus Magazine remarked that \\"the Crimea pick up the swooning where they left off\\" on Tragedy Rocks.

It is published by Ubisoft and was developed by Left Field Productions, the developer previously responsible for, among other games, Excitebike 64, MTX Mototrax and Dave Mirra BMX Challenge. It began development in October 2006, and was announced by Ubisoft at its E3 2007 press conference in Santa Monica, California. It was also announced that this would be an exclusive Wii title, and that it would be the first Motocross game for the Wii. Nitrobike was released in 2008 on both the Wii and PlayStation 2. Gameplay A gameplay screenshot of Nitrobike Nitrobike features gameplay that is somewhat similar to its predecessors Excitebike 64 and Excite Truck. The controls in this game are similar to Excite Truck, with player holding the Wii Remote on its side and twisting the remote to the right or left in order to steer. The physics in the game, while still retaining some aspect of realism, have a very arcade- like feel. According to the CEO of Left Field Productions, James Higgins, the game will be about five times as fast as Excitebike 64, and players will be able to perform more impressive jumps than in the game's predecessors. Higgins also noted that by performing tricks while in the air, players will be able to boost longer, which in turn will allow them to finish tracks faster. Nitrobike features online play allowing up to six players to race against each other simultaneously. Players can compete in random worldwide matches or exchange friend codes to play against friends. The game will keep record of the number of races friends have competed in and the number of first-place finishes. Reception The Wii version of Nitrobike received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Nintendo Power said it was a \\"disappointing wreck of a Wii game.\\" IGN claimed the Wii version had decent gameplay, but its presentation lacked \\"soul\\". GameSpot called it \\"a slow, clumsy mess.\\" GameTrailers sole praise for the same console version was for the unlockable \\"Crash Bowling\\" minigame, which, while \\"not particularly fun ... will keep [the player] from playing the main game.\\" In Japan, where the same console version was ported for release on March 27, 2008, Famitsu gave it a score of one four, two fives, and one four for a total of 18 out of 40.

Art by Grzegorz Rosiński. The Island of Frozen Seas is the second album of Thorgal, a European comic book series, written by a Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and the Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiński. It was first published in 1980 by Le Lombard under the title L'lle des Mers Gelees. It continues the story characters of Thorgal Aegirsson, Aaricia, Gandalf the Mad, and Slivia.  Summary  The story opens with a pre-wedding ceremony held for Thorgal and Aaricia. Although Gandalf the Mad has accepted Thorgal, tensions are still high between Thorgal and Bjorn, Gandalf's son, who still resents Thorgal and sees him as a rival to Gandalf's throne. When Aaricia is suddenly carried off by an eagle and apparently kidnapped, the Vikings rush into pursuit. While they follow a mysterious \\"ship with no sails\\", which only Thorgal has seen and identified as Aaricia's kidnapper, they find themselves on the freezing northern seas, unprepared for the weather and without supplies. Lost and desperate, they accuse Thorgal of leading them into a trap, and they leave him and Bjorn in a small boat to fend for themselves. Minutes later, they are attacked by the \\"ship with no sails\\" and taken into captivity. Once they awake, a crazed Bjorn attacks Thorgal but falls off the boat onto ice. A starving and exhausted Thorgal finds himself on the coast of an island, where he befriends the locals. They tell him that they are enslaved by the \\"Lords\\" and forced to work in mines. From the description of one of them, the Lord of the Eagles, Thorgal realizes he has found Aaricia's kidnapper, and sets off to find him. He is joined by Bjorn, who also survived. They find the Lord, but before Thorgal can find anything out, Bjorn kills the Lord. Bjorn is then attacked and killed by the eagles. When Thorgal takes off the Lord's helm, he finds that the Lord is in fact a woman, who reveals to him that she is Silva's daughter and tells Thorgal where to find her before she dies. Thorgal enters Silva's palace and finds Aaricia. The palace looks like the inside of a space ship, and also has hallways filled with bodies in pods. When Thorgal finds Silvia, she explains to him that she kidnapped Aaricia to force him to come to the palace and marry her daughter and ensure the survival of their people. She tells him that Thorgal and her are one of the last descendants of a race of technologically advanced people, who left Earth centuries earlier after a massive cataclysm of their homeland. They were forced to return to Earth in search of new energy sources, but their ship was damaged during landing and they were unable to repair it. Posing as gods, they enslaved the native inhabitants of the island and forced them to work in coal mines. Thorgal is incredulous, but accepts Silvia's story after she tells him all hope is lost and he is free to go with Aaricia. Thorgal and the locals free the enslaved miners, including the Vikings. They leave the island to go back to their home. Thorgal makes a decision to forget about his origins and live a peaceful life with his wife.  Arc significance  In this book, Silvia tells Thorgal he is one of the last descendants of a group of technologically advanced people who left Earth centuries earlier, after their own home was destroyed in a massive cataclysm. They came back to Earth in search of new energy sources, but their ship was damaged and they were forced to stay on Earth. They began dying of a mysterious illness, and Thorgal was born aboard a sinking ship during his parents' unsuccessful attempt to get off the island. Silvia's \\"palace\\" on the Island of Frozen seas is actually the wreckage of the spaceship used by Thorgal's ancestors on their doomed trip to Earth.

Shemza was a leading member of a modernist group called the Lahore Art Circle. His early works showed a distinct geometric structure. He studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and gained a diploma of fine art from University College. In 1960, he obtained a scholarship from the British Council to study printmaking with Anthony Gross for another year. While in Britain, he married English artist Mary Katrina. British career Shemza and his wife returned to Pakistan at first but they moved to Mary Katrina's hometown of Stafford, England, in 1962. He worked as an arts teacher at Ounsdale High School between 1962 and 1979 and at Weston Road High School as head of art and design between 1979 and 1985. It was while teaching at Ounsdale in 1966 that Shemza's daughter Tasveer, aged six, designed one of Britain's first series of Christmas stamps. Tazveer’s design, featuring King Wenceslas, was chosen by eight professional stamp designers from 5,000 entries in a Blue Peter competition. In England, Shemza started to incorporate Islamic themes into his work. His Meem series of the 1960s was based on the first letter of the prophet Mohammed's name. His Roots series started in the 1970s and showed imaginary plants and roots derived from Arabic script below, while his silkscreen The Page from 1984 showed Arabic letters in illegible patterns. Exhibitions of Shemza's works were held in London, Durham, Lahore, Karachi, and Oxford. The Roots exhibition toured Pakistan after his death from a heart attack in 1985. He was survived by his wife and two daughters. Legacy Anwar Shemza's artworks are held in many public collections including the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, UK), Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (UAE), Lahore Museum (Lahore, Pakistan), Pakistan National Council of the Arts (Islamabad, Pakistan), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, USA), Sharjah Art Foundation (UEA), Tate (London, UK), His granddaughter, Aphra Shemza, is a multimedia artist. In 2020, she launched an Arts Council-funded project shemza.digital, featuring her grandfather's 1962 painting One to Nine and One to Seven.

He was a right-handed batsman who played first- class cricket for Derbyshire and Oxford University. He won the Military Cross during World War I and became headmaster of two schools. Early life Bell was born in Stapenhill, Derbyshire and was related to the Evershed brewing family. He made his first County Championship appearance in 1914, though his cricketing career was summarily halted by the First World War. In 1915, he was commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery and was awarded the Military Cross in 1919. Career After the war he went to study at Oxford University, and returned to the arena of first-class cricket playing for the University in 1919. He played his first of seven games, most of which were against assembled elevens such as the Gentlemen of England and HDG Leveson-Gower's XI. Bell made his return appearance for Derbyshire towards the back end of the 1919 season, their ninth place in the season's table something of a false hope for times to come. Bell made his final three appearances for Derbyshire during the 1920 season, finishing with a duck in his first appearance, though his form improved in the first innings of his next game and, although the final game of his season saw him achieve an innings of 11, before getting out, he found himself dropped from the team, never to make another first-class appearance. After university, he became a schoolmaster and in 1927 became headmaster of Trent College where he was held in high regard by the boys and was seen as a forward-thinking man. During his time, the Warner Library was opened in 1929 and the Cricket Pavilion in 1933. In 1936 he went on to become headmaster of Highgate School where he was seen as an austere but respected figurehead. In 1954 he decided to leave teaching and Highgate while he was still enjoying it, so he took an early pension and bought six acres in Hampshire where he planted an orchard and built a house and a simple fruit store on it. He made a living and employed several workers.Geoffrey Bell Establishing a Fruit Garden Stanley Paul & Co, 1963 He died in Haslemere.

It is one of four small townships within the locality of Boyne Valley, along with Nagoorin, Builyan, and Many Peaks. Ubobo is a small town found in the middle of the Boyne Valley, which is mostly made up of family farms that have been passed on to the next generation over the years. The town is made up of the Ubobo General Store, the local garage, two small churches, a small historical centre, a well-used QCWA hall, the Ubobo Discovery Center that has been restored by the community, as well as Ubobo State School. Ubobo State School is one of three schools in the Boyne Valley.  History  The Town of Ubobo appears on a 1921 survey plan U7251. The name comes from the from railway station name, assigned in 1910 by the Queensland Railways Department and is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning wild arrowroot. It was established as one of the soldier settlements created after World War I. Ubobo State School opened on 23 March 1927. The Boyne Valley branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association (QCWA)was established on 21 November 1935. On 24 December 1953, the Ububo Memorial Hall was burned down in a fire.

It has thin, rough bark on the older stems, narrow egg-shaped leaves, relatively large white flowers and flat topped fruit that is shed shortly after reaching maturity. Description Leptospermum laevigatum is a bushy shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of and has thin, rough bark on the older stems. The young stems are covered with silky hairs at first and have a groove near the base of the petiole. The leaves are greyish green, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide on a short petiole. The flowers are borne on short side shoots, usually in pairs of different ages, and are usually wide. There are many reddish brown bracts around the flower buds but most fall off as the flower opens. The floral cup is mostly glabrous, long with the upper part expanded. The sepals are triangular, about long, the petals white, long and the stamens long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the fruit is a capsule wide with the remains of the sepals initially attached. The fruit mostly fall from the plant shortly after reaching maturity. Taxonomy and naming This teatree was first formally described in 1788 by Joseph Gaertner who gave it the name Fabricia laevigata and published the description in his book De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum. In 1858, Ferdinand von Mueller changed the name to Leptospermum laevigatum. The specific epithet (laevigatum) is from a Latin word meaning \\"made smooth\\" or \\"having a polished surface\\". Distribution and habitat Leptospermum laevigatum is native to New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania where it grows in heath, sometimes forest and on coastal dunes and cliffs south from Nambucca Heads in New South Wales to Anglesea in Victoria and northern Tasmania. It has also been introduced to Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and countries overseas including southern Africa, New Zealand, Hawaii and the Central Coast of California. Ecology Coast teatree is salt-resistant, very hardy and is commonly used in amenities plantings and coastal plantings. It has also been planted in Western Australia where it has become a weed. This species has been planted along the Central Coast of California in the United States to stabilize sand. It is known there as the Australian tea tree. The seeds can be dispersed by wind and water. It has now become naturalised in New Zealand, southern Africa, California and Hawaii. The larvae of Holocola thalassinana feed on Leptospermum laevigatum. Cultivation L. laevigatum is planted widely as a garden ornamental or display tree. It is useful as a windbreak or hedging plant and for the rapid stabilisation of sandy soils, and in rehabilitation areas where construction or mining has taken place. Conservation status L. laevigatum is not listed on the advisory list of rare or threatened plants in Victoria (2014).

The Dick Smith Wilderness is a wilderness area in the mountains of eastern Santa Barbara County, California, United States, with a portion in Ventura County. It is completely contained within the Los Padres National Forest, and is northeast of the city of Santa Barbara and north of the city of Ojai. It is most easily accessible from two trailheads off State Route 33, which runs north from Ojai. It is adjacent to the large San Rafael Wilderness on the west and the Matilija Wilderness on the south. Across Highway 33 to the east, and also in the Los Padres National Forest, is the large Sespe Wilderness. The wilderness is named after Santa Barbaran Dick Smith, who was a reporter, photographer, historian and pioneer in environmental journalism for the Santa Barbara News-Press. Smith spent more time in these remote regions of Santa Barbara County than anyone, covering the area on horseback and accompanied by his dog. In recognition of Dick's personal pursuit to preserve the wild back country the area was named in his honor, and the U.S. Congress created the wilderness in 1984 as part of the California Wilderness Act.From the Dick Smith Wilderness description page at the Los Padres National Forest web site Geography The wilderness is in the Transverse Ranges, east of the junction of the San Rafael Mountains and Sierra Madre Mountains at Big Pine Mountain. Madulce Peak, at 6,541 feet, is the highest mountain completely within the wilderness, and the lowest point is 3,700 feet where Santa Barbara Creek exits to the north. The wilderness contains the divide between two watersheds: the Cuyama River to the north, and the Santa Ynez River to the south. The major streams carrying runoff to those two rivers are Santa Barbara Creek and Mono Creek, respectively. The Big Pine Fault cuts through the wilderness from west to east, trending northeast after exiting the wilderness, in the direction of the nearby San Andreas Fault, which is only about 12 miles from the wilderness boundary. The Pine Mountain Fault splits off from the Big Pine; it is visible along the southern slope of nearby Reyes Peak. Most rocks in the wilderness are Eocene marine sediments, with some scattered outcrops of Pliocene, Miocene, and Oligocene sediments, especially immediately to the south of the Pine Mountain Fault (the contact between these rock units and the Eocene sediments defines the Big Pine Fault).Jennings/Strand, Geologic Map of California, Los Angeles Sheet (1:250,000 scale). Climate The climate of the wilderness is Mediterranean, but modified by distance from the ocean. Since much of the wilderness is separated from the ocean by a mountain divide, and is at fairly high altitude, freezes are common in the winter, as is occasional snow. Summers at lower elevations are hot and dry; rain is extremely rare between April and October, and dry lightning from the occasional thunderstorms can start fires. Vegetation and wildlife Vegetation in the wilderness is predominantly chaparral, although there are regions of conifers, including big cone Douglas fir, especially on north- facing slopes, such as the northern exposure of Madulce Peak.From the Dick Smith Wilderness description page at the Los Padres National Forest web site Streams contain riparian vegetation, and there are some stands of oak trees. A relict population of great basin sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is visible along Highway 33 at the Bear Canyon trailhead; several populations of this species are left over from the last glacial epoch, when it was more widespread due to the cooler climate then. Wildlife that may be encountered in the wilderness includes coyotes, black bears, and mountain lions. The California condor can occasionally be seen, since the endangered bird was released back into the wild in 1992, and the wilderness is positioned between the two major Southern California condor sanctuaries, the Sisquoc (in the San Rafael Wilderness to the northwest) and the Sespe (in the Sespe wilderness to the southeast). History The region has been continuously inhabited by humans for over 10,000 years. Rock art by the resident Chumash Indians is scattered across the region; locations of rock paintings are generally not made public for fear of vandalism. Almost all of the wilderness was burned in 2007 by the Zaca Fire. References * Gagnon, Dennis R. Hiking the Santa Barbara Backcountry. The Ward Ritchie Press, Pasadena, California, 1974. * Charles W.

The school was unpopular with many local residents, who opposed having blacks in the town. After some months, several hundred white men of Canaan and neighboring towns demolished the academy. They replaced it with Canaan Union Academy, restricted to whites. Background In the background of the Noyes Academy's foundation is the unsuccessful attempt, in 1831, to found a college for African Americans in New Haven, Connecticut. The citizens of that city \\"vociferously condemned the Black College proposal. The intensity of passion that exploded over the college meant the idea was stillborn.\\" (See Simeon Jocelyn and New Haven Excitement.) A direct result was the formation of the New England Anti-Slavery Society. \\"A more modest, and some thought wiser, course of action\\" was working to get black students admitted to existing academies and colleges. \\"The idea gradually evolved that, in the short run, what was needed was an integrated preparatory school\\" to prepare blacks for college or seminary. Founding Noyes Academy was begun by New England men sympathetic to the abolitionist movement, including Samuel Noyes (1754–1845), uncle of the John Humphrey Noyes who founded the Oneida Community, attorney George Kimball of Canaan, and Samuel Edmund Sewall of Boston. Demand was growing for educational facilities open to African Americans at a time when public education was expanding, as many schools were segregated. Kimball noted: > It is unhappily true, that the colored portion of our fellow citizens, even > in the free States, while their toil and blood have contributed to > establish, and their taxes equally with those of whites to maintain our free > system of Education, have practically been excluded from the benefits of it. > This institution proposes to restore, so far as it can, to thus neglected > and injured class, the privileres of literarv, moral and religious > instruction. We propose to uncover a fountain of pure and healthful > learning, holding towards all the language of the Book of Life [Isaiah > 55.1]: \\" Ho! EVERY ONE that thirsteth, let him come and drink.\\" The plan for the school received the approbation of the New Hampshire Anti- Slavery Society at its first meeting. Trustees and donors to the school agreed to have an interracial student body, announcing it in the February 28, 1835 issue of The Liberator. \\"Youths will be fitted for admission into any of the Colleges and Universities of the United States; but it is intended that this Seminary shall itself afford means of such correct and extensive classical attainments, as shall qualify young men to commence the study of the learned professions.\\" This announcement also said that a teacher, William Scales, a senior at the Andover Theological Seminary, was hired, and gave a long list of subjects to be taught. Another teacher, Mary Harris, was hired for the \\"female department\\", but the school was destroyed before she could begin. Opening of the school The school, in a \\"neat and handsome edifice\\", opened in March 1835, with 28 white and 17 African-American students. The white students were generally from local families, but many of the black students had traveled from as far as Philadelphia to attend the academy, because of limited educational opportunities elsewhere. They were described as having a \\"modest and becoming deportment\\" and \\"inoffensive, polite and unassuming manners\\". They often had to travel in poor conditions on segregated steamboats and stagecoaches, and while on the boats being barred from the cabin and forced to remain on deck whatever the weather. On a journey of , \\"rarely could they get food and nowhere could they find lodging.\\" Several future prominent African- American abolitionists, such as Henry Highland Garnet, Thomas Paul, Jr., Thomas S. Sydney, Julia Williams, Charles L. Reason, and Alexander Crummell attended the school during the several months that it was open.Hilary J. Moss, Schooling Citizens: The Struggle for African American Education in Antebellum America (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), pp. 1-3 Williams, who would later marry Garnet, had been a student at Prudence Crandall's Canterbury Female Boarding School for \\"young Ladies and little Misses of color\\", which was also destroyed by a mob in 1834 after being open only a short time. Garnet and some other students boarded with Kimball. Destruction Many local residents objected to allowing blacks into the town to attend the academy, which they called a \\"nuisance\\" in a town meeting. There was an \\"oportune visit of some slavers from the South\\". Segregationists launched a campaign to discredit school officials and cultivate hysteria over the possibility of interracial marriage and racial mixing.\\" According to them, \\"[t]he village was to be overrun with negroes from the South — the slaves were to be brought on to line the streets with huts and to inundate the industrious town with paupers and vagabonds — and other tales too indecent and too ridiculous to be repeated\\". On July 31, 1835, the town voted \\"for the removal of the Noyes Academy, at which black and white children are promiscuously received. A committee was appointed to carry the vote into execution.\\" The building was \\"shattered, mutilated, inwardly beyond reparation almost.\\" It was later destroyed by arson. Kimball helped the black students leave at night for their safety. He shortly followed them, moving to Alton, Illinois, located on the Mississippi River. It became a center for abolitionist activity in the Midwest (see Elijah Parish Lovejoy). Four students — Alexander Crummell, Henry Highland Garnet, Thomas Sydney, and Julia Williams — enrolled in the Oneida Institute, in Whitesboro, New York, a hotbed of abolitionism, the most abolitionist college in the country and the first to admit blacks and whites on equal terms. Thomas Paul, Jr., was one of the first black graduates of Dartmouth College (class of 1841); he later taught at the Abiel Smith School, a school for blacks in Boston. The Noyes Academy affair \\"created much excitement against the abolitionists, and if the account in the Statesman is to be relied upon, was the means of securing the election to the Legislature of a man as hostile to the anti-slavery cause as McDuffie [Governor of South Carolina] himself could desire.\\" Canaan Union Academy, restricted to whites, was built in 1839 and operated on the Noyes site until about 1859, and again from 1888 until 1892. The building currently houses the Canaan Historical Society and Museum.

Biography =Early life and education= Honey was born in Navan, County Meath, Ireland. He went to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School in London before entering Birkbeck, University of London in 1940 to read Classics. In 1941 he enlisted in the Royal Navy, seeing active service on the Atlantic convoys, on the Russian convoys, in the Italian campaign, and finally the Far East. In 1945, when the Japanese surrendered in Saigon, the young lieutenant was sent with a small British force under General Douglas Gracey to maintain civil order in Saigon. This was Honey's first encounter with Vietnamese culture. Also in 1945, he married Frances Watson (who died in 1986) and had one son and two daughters with her. In 1946, after being demobilised, he resumed his studies in London, and graduated in Classics from University College London in 1949. =Career= In 1949, Honey was recruited to take up the Vietnamese language, which was considered very difficult, requiring a special aptitude from classics graduates to master. Honey was persuaded by the 1947 Scarbrough Report, which drew attention both to the importance that increasing contacts between countries would assume after the Second World War and to the serious lack of expertise across Oriental and African languages that the war had revealed. He was trained under J. R. Firth. From 1949 to 1965 he served as the first Lecturer in Annamese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. After 16 months of preliminary training, he was sent to Vietnam for his first year of long study. In 1951 Honey arrived at Saigon, when the guerrilla war led by the Vietminh against the French was increased. With a lot of difficulties and at considerable risk, Honey was able to make it to Hanoi to conduct his research and study the local language. This period was very valuable, since in 1954, the Geneva Agreements partitioned the country into two-halves, and North Vietnam was not accessible for a long time. During this time, Honey also earned a BA degree in Chinese. He became a valuable source of knowledge about Southeast Asia and its cultures, languages, and politics. Many students from Australia and from the United States came to study with him. The British Foreign Office sought his advice about Vietnam. Also seeking his wisdom was the US Government. On 26 September 1963, in Saigon, Vietnam, at the invitation of the 5th US Ambassador to the State of Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., P.J. Honey briefed the 8th US Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara. Introduced to McNamara by Lodge as Professor Smith from an American University, P.J. Honey's influence upon McNamara can be seen throughout McNamara's report on his encounter with Honey; an aide to McNamara – William P. Bundy – later reported that he thought that \\"Smith's\\" testimony had carried \\"considerable weight with McNamara\\" (See footnote 2).https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v04/d150 Here is a condensed version of what McNamara wrote after his briefing by P.J. Honey: \\"2. (Ngo Dinh) Diem has aged terribly since 1960. He is slow mentally. ... 4\\\\. (Ngo Dinh) Diem would not last 24 hours without (Ngo Dinh) Nhu who handles the bribes and manipulates the power base necessary for his survival. ... 8\\\\. ... Only a military coup or an assassination will be effective and one or the other is likely to occur soon. In such circumstances we have a 50% chance of getting something better. ... 14\\\\. The American government cannot do anything other than to either publicly support (Ngo Dinh) Diem or keep our mouths shut. If we follow the latter policy, a coup will probably take place within four weeks.\\"https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v04/d150 By the end of the sixth week after this report was written, both Ngo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu are dead. In 1964 Cornell University invited P.J. Honey as a visiting professor. In 1965 Honey was promoted to Reader in Vietnamese Studies in the University of London, a post he held until 1985. After 1975, when Saigon fell, as the boat people flooded the outside world, his language skills were called upon to brief both officials and refugees from Vietnam. From 1982 to 1985 he was head of the Department of South-East Asia, after which he retired and moved to Devon. In 1991 he remarried, wedding Isabelle Boyer. Published works From the 1950s Honey wrote many articles about Vietnamese language, history, and politics. His major research interest was the communist regime in North Vietnam. His books included: *Introduction to Hoàng Văn Chí's From Colonialism to Communism. 1962 *Communism in North Vietnam: Its Role in the Sino-Soviet Dispute. Hardcover, Greenwood Press, 1963.

He was then optioned back to Triple-A on June 19. His latest call- up was on July 25, when he took Chris Ray's place on the roster, after Ray was placed on the DL. Doyne's major league debut was June 16, 2007, against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The first batter he faced was Conor Jackson, who was also the first walk he surrendered in his career (on five pitches). His first out recorded came against the very next batter, as Arizona second baseman Orlando Hudson grounded the 7th pitch of the at-bat to second, and was retired 4-3. His first career strike out came in his second Major League game (also at Camden Yards) on July 25, 2007, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Carl Crawford, the first batter Doyne faced in the game, swung and missed on the fourth pitch of the at-bat. Doyne retired the next two batters on fly balls, turning in the first complete inning of his career. The first earned run he surrendered came the next night, also against the Devil Rays. Doyne came on to pitch in the 9th inning, and walked Brendan Harris to begin the inning (his second career walk). Harris moved over to third base on a single by catcher Raul Casanova, and scored on a sacrifice fly off the bat of Akinori Iwamura. Casanova would later score Doyne's second career earned run on a single by Greg Norton, but Doyne would complete the inning, and the Orioles won the game by a score of 10-7.

Adults weigh around . It is known as bia and tabios in the Philippines., Guide to the Philippine Flora and Fauna, Band IX, (undated). Distribution and habitat P. pygmaea was initially reported as being endemic to Malabon, Metro Manila in the Philippines, where found at shady river banks. The species has now been extirpated from this area as it was reclaimed, leading to its status as critically endangered by the IUCN. More recently, it has been discovered at a range of other locations in Southeast Asia, including Culion Island, Bali, Sulawesi and Singapore. As part of the aquarium trade, it was imported into Germany in 1958. P. pygmaea lives in shallow, tropical brackish water and mangrove areas where mainly found on muddy bottoms or among plants. Also known before as National Fish in the Philippines on 1994 until recently they changed it to milk fish Appearance and anatomy A colorless and nearly transparent species, the dwarf pygmy goby has a moderately elongated and robust body. Males are slender with nearly straight dorsal and ventral profiles, while the females appear stouter with the dorsal profile slightly curved, the belly protuberant, and the ventral outline strongly arched. The head of the P. pygmaea is large and blunt. The head and nape are naked. The upper and lower profiles converge and are pointed if viewed from the sides. The head is characteristically broader than deep. The head is very short, broad and rounded. The mouth is very oblique, with a projecting lower jaw and chin. The posterior angle of the maxillary extends beneath the anterior part of the eye, up to the middle of pupil. It possesses two rows of teeth in each jaw. The outer row of teeth inside the upper jaw is larger and more widely spaced, while the inner row is characteristically minute. The first dorsal fin is low, much in advance of the second dorsal fin but not reaching the second dorsal fin when depressed. The pectoral and ventral fins are pointed, with the latter about as long as the former or longer. The anal papilla is very short and rounded in females, but is longer and very slender in males. P. pygmaea have dark spots, which forms 4 cross-bands, over the sides of its body. The bases of the fins are heavily pigmented, except for the ventral fins. It has 22 to 25 scales in longitudinal series. Behavior =Feeding= This species feeds on plankton. =Reproduction= P. pygmaea is an oviparous species. Miscellaneous Pandaka pygmaea was once portrayed on a Philippine ten centavo coin where, uniquely for a wildlife portrayal on coinage, it is depicted at life-size.

Home ports were by Tengen. Vindicators was not licensed by Nintendo and used an alternate chip to defeat the 10NES lockout system. Ports were planned for the Atari Lynx and Apple IIGS, with the latter even completed, but both were cancelled. The arcade original was released for Windows PCs on Midway Arcade Treasures (2004).  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot The game begins by asking the player(s) to choose a difficulty level, not only making the enemies more difficult and the players weaker, but higher difficulties start the players in a later set of levels (called \\"galaxies\\") and with some powerups. The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. (15 for the NES version, though the timer stays stuck at 10 for five seconds before counting) If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station. Occasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level. Between levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost. The arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.  Development  Vindicators arcade machine in the Computerspielemuseum Berlin  Release   Reception   Legacy  =Sequel= Vindicators Part II A sequel to the arcade version was released the same year as a conversion kit for Gauntlet titled Vindicators Part II. Only approximately 400 units were made. There are only a few minor differences as the gameplay is nearly identical to the first, even keeping 10 of the 14 original stations of the first Vindicators. It even keeps the old graphics, music and sound. Though the in-game voice was changed to a less robotic sounding male, and several tank upgrades were added that are picked up as powerups and expire after a level is finished. Vindicators Part II was included in the 2012 compilation Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/14/midway-arcade-origins-review References External links  *Vindicators at the Arcade History database *Vindicators Part II at the Arcade History database *Vindicators at World of Spectrum Category:1988 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Arcade games Category:Atari arcade games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled Atari Lynx games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Midway video games Category:Unauthorized video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Tengen (company) games Category:Video games scored by Brad Fuller Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Warner Bros.

The Academy emphasizes academic achievement, leadership, and character development. It is formerly known as Lyman Ward Military Academy.  History  The Academy was founded by Dr. Lyman Ward in 1898 as a non-profit, non-denominational, all-male institution for the rural youth of Alabama. The school is located about 20 miles from Auburn. The original purpose was to provide a secondary education for those with the ability to learn, the willingness to work and in turn better themselves. In 1901, the State of Alabama granted Ward a charter incorporating the school with the name, The Southern Industrial Institute, Inc. In 1948, Ward's passing led to the establishment of a military department. The school then changed its name to Lyman Ward Military Academy in honor of its founder. At this time, the school also ended its elementary and co-ed programs. In 1966, the school became a member of the JROTC program, and is currently assigned a retired officer and NCO by the Department of Army. In 1972, the school received its first accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools which it maintains to this day. In 2019, Lyman Ward Military Academy changed its name to Southern Preparatory Academy, retaining the military department.  Campus  Southern Prep is located on on land, and contains two athletic fields, a parade field, two lakes (Lake Mary & Lake Ann), double tennis courts, three dormitories, an administration building, a dining hall, indoor swimming pool, gymnasium, indoor and outdoor rifle ranges, supply building, JROTC building, infirmary, administration building, library, auditorium, chapel, and canteen.

Publications  In The Intellectual Tradition in the Old Testament (1974) Whybray questioned the common scholarly assumption that there was in ancient Israel a class of 'wise men' or intellectuals who controlled affairs of state and to whose interests and outlook we owe the biblical 'wisdom literature'. Whybray put forward the proposition that the evidence for any such group of wise men in ancient Israel was lacking, that 'wisdom' was not the preserve of a class or an institution, and the wise were simply educated citizens \\"who were accustomed to read for education and pleasure\\". Wisdom literature, according to Whybray, was therefore the product of literary-minded individuals among the intellectuals. In The Making of the Pentateuch (1987) Whybray examined the evidence for the documentary hypothesis, the dominant hypothesis on the origins of the Pentateuch for more than a century, and concluded that it was insubstantial. His alternative proposal was that the Pentateuch was essentially the work of a single author who drew upon multiple sources and disregarded, or was ignorant of, modern notions of literary consistency and smoothness of style and language. The book remained the most complete critique of the documentary hypothesis by a mainstream biblical scholar for at least a decade from its publication.

The production was originally entitled Muskie Madness, and many of the film's crew will still refer to it by that title; but when picked up for distribution, Troma insisted the title be changed. Though very much a low-budget production, Blood Hook is distinguished from the other slasher flicks of the time by its quirky sense of macabre, tongue-in-cheek humor. Although the film wasn't successful, its director, Jim Mallon, and lyricist/key grip Kevin Murphy later went on to work on the popular cult television program Mystery Science Theater 3000. The film poster was illustrated by artist Tricia Zimic. Release The film has been released on VHS by several companies including Paramount Home Entertainment and Troma Entertainment.

He studied law and chose a career at the Ministry of Transport. Due to his experiences as a civil servant in Brussels, he felt the treatment of Flemings by the French speakers was unjust. This caused him to take an initiative to improve the situation of native Dutch speakers in the capital city of Belgium. He founded the Verbond van Vlaams Overheidspersoneel, 'Union of Flemish civil servants', and the Centraal Secretariaat van Vlaamse Verenigingen, 'Central Secretariat for the Flemish Associations'. He was also an editor of several magazines and additionally made his point clear in speeches and letters he wrote to newspapers. In 1969, he founded a kindergarten for the children of native Dutch speakers in Brussels. Szondi was a municipal councillor for the CVP, Christelijke Volkspartij or 'Flemish Christian Democrat Party', in the municipality Etterbeek (in the Brussels Region). In that position, he regularly got into conflict with the French- speaking majority. Due to his merits for the Flemish movement, he received several Flemish honour awards.

The act was meant to fill funding gaps in the airport and airway system, which had become inadequate due to the rapid growth of aviation. The legislation was estimated to generate greater than $11 billion in funds, Together, the two acts created and planned funding for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Airport Trust Fund), which was initiated on July 1, 1970. The new Airport Trust Fund was modeled on the Federal Highway Trust Fund, and would be fulfilled by new aviation-related excise taxes. These new taxes, including a tax on aviation fuels, a tax placed on tickets sold to passengers on domestic and international flights, a tax on waybills, and a new tax on aircraft registration, were expected to provide the anticipated $11 billion trust fund. These taxes would feed into the Airport Trust Fund in order to pay for airport development, as well as \\"acquiring, establishing, and improving air navigational facilities.\\" The fund was authorized to pay for these improvements using $280-million-a-year grants over a five-year period. It is believed that this user fee system would be advantageous compared to a flat tax, because it provided a predictable level of funding, allowed for the trust to plan far ahead, and assured fees meant for aviation related improvements would not be divided amongst unrelated fields. Six years after the act became law, the Act was augmented by the Airport and Airway Development Act Amendments of 1976. The 1976 legislation was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in order to \\"make possible the continuing modernization of our airways, airports, and related facilities in communities throughout the 50 States.\\" Ford stated these amendments would combat inflation and referred to the system as creating a \\"'pay-as-you-fly' program\\".

Hunting During the day they hide under rocks and debris, and come out at night to look for prey. Their fangs are quite formidable at more than 2 centimeters long, and when they pierce the body of its prey, venom is injected, which paralyzes and breaks down the internal body tissue, allowing the tarantula to suck up the liquified insides. Its bite is rarely harmful to humans, but can cause irritation and swelling. Names In the Dominican Republic, it is called cacata; in Haiti, it is called araignée-krab (literally \\"crab spider\\"). As prey Their most dangerous predator is the tarantula hawk. Locally it is known as a matacacata (the tarantula-killer). This is a very large parasitoid wasp, with an iridescent blue-green body and orange-red wings that grows to about 2 inches or more in length. It captures the spider in its burrow or sometimes in the open and stings it to paralyze it and then lays its eggs on the abdomen. The wasp will drag its victim to a safe place to incubate its young.

It's essentially a container of oil that is heated by a hot plate or (in rare cases) a Bunsen burner.  Use  These baths are commonly used to heat reaction mixtures more evenly than would be possible with a hot plate alone, as the entire outside of the reaction flask is heated. Generally, silicone oil is used in modern oil baths, although mineral oil, cottonseed oil and even phosphoric acid have been used in the past.  Hazards  Overheating the oil bath can result in a fire hazard, especially if mineral oil is being used. Generally, the maximum safe operating temperature of a mineral oil bath is approximately 160 °C, the oil's flash point. Mineral oil can't be used above 310 °C in any cases, due to the compound's boiling point. If higher temperatures are needed, a silicone oil or a sand bath may be used instead.  In mechanics  A oil bath air filter at the upper left in a GAZ-21 engine Another use of an oil bath is to filter particulates out of air, by leading the air stream through an unheated oil bath.

She was a member of the ancient gens Otacilia, of consular and senatorial rank. Her father was Otacilius Severus or Severianus, who served as Roman Governor of Macedonia and Moesia, while her mother was a member of gens Marcia or was related to the gens. According to sources she had a brother called Severianus, who served as Roman Governor of Lower Moesia in 246–247.  Life  In 234, Severa married Philip who at that time probably served in the Praetorian Guard under Emperor Alexander Severus and they had three children: * Marcus Iulius Philippus Severus or Philippus II (born in 238); * Iulia Severa or Severina who is known from numismatic evidence but is never mentioned by the ancient Roman written sources; * Quintus Philippus Severus (born in 247). In February 244, the emperor Gordianus died in Mesopotamia, it is suspected in the sources that he was murdered, and there is a possibility that Severa was involved in the conspiracy. Her husband Philip became the new emperor and he gave his young predecessor a proper funeral and his ashes were returned to Rome for burial. Philip gave Severa the honorific title of Augusta and had their son made heir of the purple. Severa and Philip are sometimes considered as the first Christian imperial couple, because during their reign the persecutions of Christians had ceased and the couple had become tolerant towards Christianity but their beliefs have not been proven. It was through her intervention, for instance, that Bishop and Saint Babylas of Antioch was saved from persecution. In 249, the Danubian armies proclaimed Decius Augustus and in August, Philip died in battle near Verona and Decius became the sole emperor. Severa was in Rome at that time and when the news of her husband’s death arrived, their son was murdered by the Praetorian Guard still in her arms. Severa survived her husband and son and lived later in obscurity. Silver Antoninianus of Octalia Severa. On a tetradrachm of Antioch, Syria, struck AD 247.

In Roman times, it was the site of a 3½ acre (1.5 ha) auxiliary fort on Hadrian's Wall called Brocolitia, Procolita, or Brocolita.The name \\"Procolita\\" is found in the 5th-century document Notitia Dignitatum, and \\"Brocoliti\\" in the 7th-century Ravenna Cosmography. In both instances it appears between the entries for Chesters (Cilurnum/Celunnum) and Housesteads(Borcovicium/Velurtion). This name is probably based on the Celtic name for the place, and one possible translation put forward is 'badger holes'. The fort there was a mile or so west of the Wall's northernmost point at Limestone Corner, and just over a mile west of the nearest milecastle, Milecastle 30. The fort either used the Wall (narrow gauge on a broad base at this point) itself as its northern rampart, or was built parallel to it but detached. It certainly postdates both the Wall and the vallum (which it is built across). Only the fort's earthworks are now visible, the Wall at this point and the fort's north ramparts having been demolished for the construction of General Wade's early 18th-century military road (now the B6318). The late 19th-century archaeologist John Clayton carried out a partial excavation of the site, revealing a military bath-house outside the fort's west gate (in 1873) and the fort's south-west corner-tower (in 1876). The Roman Inscriptions of Britain lists 48 inscriptions for the site. They show its garrisoning units to have been as follows: *RIB 1550 – Hadrianic? c. AD133 – First Cohort of Aquitani *RIB 1563b – AD122-138 – Cohors I Tungrorum *End 2nd century – Cohors I Cugernorum *RIB 1544,Altar to Mithras RIB 1553, and Notitia Dignitarum – AD213-222, AD237, and AD400 respectivelyThe latter is one of the few pieces of evidence for the governor Tuccianus, under the emperor Maximinus – First Cohort of Batavians The First Cohort of Frisiavones are also attested at Brocolitia at some stage, as shown by an inscription on an altar stone, which tells us that Optio Maus had repaid a vow to the goddess Coventina. (This unit is also recorded as present at Ardotalia.Roman Britain – Ardotalia) Whether this altar was the repayment of the vow is unknown. Roman sanctuaries Remains of the Brocolitia mithraeum. The remains of three Roman sanctuaries have been discovered in the low-lying marshy ground beyond the fort's south-west corner. All three sites lie adjacent to a small tributary stream of Meggie's Dene Burn, which runs three miles from Carrawburgh to empty into the River South Tyne near Newbrough's fort on the Stanegate. Nearest to the fort, about 80 metres from its south- west corner, are the remains of an early 3rd century mithraeum, i.e. a temple of the mystery cult of the Roman god Mithras. Discovered in 1949 and excavated by I.A. Richmond and J.P. Gillam in 1950, it is the second-most northernly mithraeum discovered so far – only Bremenium (High Rochester), more than ten miles from Brocolitia, is further north... The Brocolitia mithraeum is also the only sanctuary outside the Rhine provinces from which a monument of the goddess Vagdavercustis has been recovered. Like most other mithraea, the Brocolitia temple was built to resemble a cave, and also had the usual anteroom, and a nave with raised benches (podia) along the sides. At Brocolitia, the anteroom and nave were separated by a wattle-work screen, the base of which was found exceptionally well preserved. Excavations revealed three stages of development: the first stage was small, around 5.5 metres wide and 8 metres long. The building was expanded to 11 metres length in a second stage, at which time the temple also gained elaborate furnishings and extensive woodwork. This second stage existed for the entire 3rd century, and included at least two major renovations. The second stage was looted and the furnishings destroyed around 296–297 AD, but the sanctuary itself and the stone monuments remained intact, and the temple was re-equipped in a third stage shortly thereafter. The third stage includes three monuments by different cohort prefects, commanders of Cohors I Batavorum, a Roman Batavi unit of auxiliary cavalry stationed at Brocolitia. All three date to the 3rd century. The youngest coin found on the premises was a freshly-minted follis of Maximian (r. 296–308). This coincides with the third structural period on Hadrian's Wall (297–367), but the complete lack of coins from after 308 suggests that the temple did not remain in use for much of the 4th century. The temple was deliberately desecrated by the removal of the primary tauroctony scene, only a piece of which was found. Other than a collapsed roof, the temple was found almost exactly as the Romans had left it. The foundations of the temple are still visible, as are the wooden stakes on which the podia benches were raised. A reconstruction of the sanctuary is on display at the Great North Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. Directly in front of the entrance to the mithraeum the remains of an apse, well, and altar were found and named as the Shrine to the Nymphs and Genius Loci, sometimes referred to as a \\"nymphaeum\\". Found in 1957 and excavated in 1960, this was the least used temple at Carrawburgh. The Shrine may not have had a traditional building, rather it was a paved and an open air shrine. The altar, dedicated by M. Hispanius Modestinus c. AD 213, was inscribed identically on two sides, and stood on a pedestal indicating it was out in the open, and meant to be walked around. It is likely that this shrine was built during a period of disuse of the Mithraeum as it was located so close to the Mithraic Temple. The building of the second Mithraeum reused materials from the Shrine to the Nymphs and Genius Loci, but preserved the altar. The shrine has a destruction layer around AD 300, roughly the same time as a destruction layer at the Temple to Mithras. The third site was 'Coventina's Well', a centre for worship of the Romano-British goddess Coventina. This sanctuary, discovered by Clayton in 1876, is the source of the stream. The well is known for the findings of over 13,000 coins, sculptural reliefs, and altars. It was built c.AD128-133, during the construction of the Vallum, in order to help control the water level of the area, it is likely after this it became associated with Coventina with the height of the cult being in the late 2nd to early 3rd centuries when the Batavians were stationed at the fort. No remains of the nymphaeum or well are now visible. Ownership Having been in private hands for many years, the fort, which is a scheduled monument, was gifted to the nation in January 2020 by Jennifer Du Cane, whose family have owned the site since the 1950s. The fort is now in the ownership of Historic England and administered by English Heritage.

We flew so low that the slipstreams threw up great rooster tails of water behind us.\\" His role was to train aircrews to drop their torpedoes \\"in point- blank range of enemy gunners\\".Kym Bonython, Ladies' Legs and Lemonade. Adelaide, South Australia: Rigby, 1979. , p. 65 In late 1943, 6 OTU began moving from Nowra to a nearby airfield at Jervis Bay. By early 1944, however, it was apparent that torpedo use in operations was dropping away. 6 OTU returned to Nowra and was disbanded on 31 March 1944.

Pantelimon \\"Pan\\" Halippa (1 August 1883 – 30 April 1979) was a Bessarabian and later Romanian journalist and politician. One of the most important promoters of Romanian nationalism in Bessarabia and of this province's union with Romania, he was president of Sfatul Țării, which voted union in 1918. He then occupied ministerial posts in several governments, following which he underwent political persecution at the hands of the Communist régime and was later incarcerated in Sighet prison. Biography Halippa was born to the poor peasants Nicolae and Paraschiva Halippa in Cubolta, then in the Russian Empire and now in Moldova's Raionul Sîngerei. Married to the teacher Eleonora Circău, he had one son. His Chișinău home is preserved as a monument today. = Education = Pan Halippa attended primary school in his native village and then took courses at the Yedintsy Spiritual School and the Kishinev Theological Seminary. After graduating from seminary in 1904, he enrolled in the Faculty of Physics and Medicine of the University of Yuryev (today University of Tartu), but a year later the Russian Revolution of 1905 broke out and he was forced to quit university. Back in Kishinev, he became involved with young Romanian intellectuals, working on Revista Basarabia, the first Romanian-language publication in Bessarabia in that period. In its pages he printed the revolutionary hymn \\"Deșteaptă-te, române!\\", which caused the Tsarist authorities to seek his arrest. Taking refuge in Iași, he enrolled in the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Iași, where he took classes from 1908 to 1912. At this time he worked on the magazine Viața românească, in which he published \\"Scrisori din Basarabia\\" (\\"Letters from Bessarabia\\"). In 1908, he published Pilde și novele (\\"Proverbs and Novels\\") in Chișinău (using Cyrillic), the first Bessarabian fiction novel, while in 1912 \\"Basarabia, schiță geografică\\" (\\"Bessarabia, Geographic Sketch\\") appeared. Returning to Chișinău in 1913, he published, together with Nicolae Alexandri and with the assistance of Vasile Stroescu, the newspaper Cuvânt moldovenesc, which he directed after April 1917. He wrote unceasingly in favour of union with Romania.  Political activity  Halippa's political activity intensified as the 1910s wore on and in 1917 he founded the Moldovan National Party. The year 1918 found him at the head of the unionist wave, for which he was elected first vice-president, then president of Sfatul Țării, the assembly which voted for the union of Bessarabia with Romania on 27 March 1918. He also took parts in the assemblies at Cernăuţi and Alba Iulia, where, respectively, the acts of union of Bukovina and Transylvania with Romania were proclaimed. After 1918 he held a number of government posts: Minister and Secretary of State for Bessarabia (1919–1920), Minister of Public Works (1927), Minister of Public Works and Communications (1930) interim Minister of Work, Health and Social Protection (1930), Minister Secretary of State (1928–1930, 1932, 1932–1933), senator and deputy in parliament (1918–1934). He was a member of the National Peasants' Party after its founding in 1926. Throughout his time in office, Halippa sought to further Bessarabia's cultural development. He founded the Chișinău Popular University (1917), the Moldovan Conservatory, the Society of Bessarabian Writers and Journalists and the Luceafărul Editorial Society and Bookstore in Chișinău (1940). In 1932 he edited and headed the magazine Viața Basarabiei (\\"Bessarabian Life\\") and the eponymous daily newspaper. In 1918 Halippa was chosen corresponding member of the Romanian Academy; removed in 1948, he was restored to its ranks posthumously in 1990. In 1950 he was arrested and imprisoned without trial at Sighet prison, in Sighetu Marmației. Two years later he was handed over to the NKVD, taken to Chișinău, tried and sentenced to 25 years' hard labour in Siberia. Brought back to Romania, he was held at Aiud until 1957.  Death  He died in Bucharest in 1979 at the age of 95 and is buried in the cemetery of Cernica Monastery.

Broome was a gifted pugilist known as \\"Young Duckro.\\" He was never defeated in the prize ring, and had a younger brother (Harry Broome) who became Heavyweight Champion of England. Johnny stood 5’ 6½\\" and weighed between 133 and 140 pounds. Early life Johnny Broome was born in Birmingham on 14 March 1818. According to one source: \\"while he was yet a boy he could ride a pony at full gallop, standing on its bare back, and hence he gained in the neighbour-hood the nickname of \\"Young Ducrow\\" (Andrew Ducrow was a famous acrobatic horseman of the age). The same source states: \\"Johnny was by trade a hammerman, and his work at the anvil strengthened and developed the muscles of his splendid chest and arms.\\" Boxing career Johnny Broome fought 10 times and was undefeated when he retired from the ring. Early fights took place with Jack Hunt, Tom Ellis and Bill Holwell, Welsh Champion, resulting in a draw and two victories for Broome. Subsequently, a fight took against Charles Spilsbury on 26 January 1835. Subsequent fights took place against: Gallet on 5 February 1838; Charley Jones at Woore, Newcastle-under-Lyme on 21 May 1839; McGinty, near Glasgow on 1 July 1840; Joe Bostock in Warwickshire on 6 October 1840. Broome won the Lightweight Championship of England when he defeated Jack Hannan in Oxfordshire, England on 26 January 1841. The bout lasted 47 rounds and 79 minutes. Broome defended his title against John Gorrick (known as \\"Bungaree\\") on 27 April 1842 near Newmarket, England. Broome won in 42 rounds and 57 minutes.Dowling’s Fights for the Championship, 1855 In addition to his fighting career, Johnny Broome was also influential in the boxing world as a financial backer and arranger of fights. One fighter that he backed for a period was William Perry (the Tipton Slasher). Broome attempted to arrange a fight between Perry and James \\"Deaf\\" Burke in August 1842, although the match was cancelled as Broome failed to pay the deposit on the match stake in time. Later in the same year Broome set up the two fights between Perry and the American, Charles Freeman. Broome also managed the fighting career of his younger brother Harry Broome, eventually setting up a fight with William Perry, which resulted in Harry Broome being recognized as Champion of England in 1851. Horse racing In 1848 Broome accepted an offer to compete in the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree. On board an unconsidered outsider named Eagle, he got as far as Becher's Brook on the second circuit before falling. Suicide Towards the end, Broome's reputation was tainted with scandal, as he was associated with some questionable transactions and a card fixing fraud. On 31 May 1855 he walked into the kitchens of the Wrekin Tavern, at Bow Street, took a carving knife and cut his own throat. He bled to death and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

The title was abandoned in 2005, when it was replaced with Kaientai Dojo's Strongest-K Tag Team Championship instead. As it was a professional wrestling championship, the championship was not won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match determined by the bookers and match makers.

They became an example as well as an exponent of how the French-speaking bourgeoisie (from Wallonia but also from Flanders) treated their Flemish fellow-citizens, of whom the language – if not its speakers – was considered inferior by the elite. Later on, the real perpetrators confessed to the murder, which in 1873 led to a debate in parliament that ended in the Coremans Act, one of the first laws to recognize Dutch as an official language in Belgium, allowing the Flemish to use their own language at Flemish courts, though not yet in Brussels. History On 23 March 1860, widow Dubois was the victim of an assault and robbery by night in Couillet near Charleroi. She was discovered in agony only the next day, and died of her injuries a few days later. To the village policeman, she had only been able to utter that her attackers spoke \\"Flemish\\". Consequently, the attention was drawn on two Flemings who had been making a living in the region, Jan Coucke, a forty-nine-year-old potato salesman born in Sint-Denijs near Kortrijk, and Pieter Goethals, a railroad worker originating from Lotenhulle and thirty-four years of age. Their trial in French at the Assize Court of Hainaut in Mons started on 20 August 1860. Although both lived in Couillet, Wallonia, and spoke French for their work, they were assisted by a Dutch translator, Pierre Van Horenbeek. Prosecutor Charles-Victor de Bavay obtained their death sentence five days later. They were beheaded on the Grand Market Place of Charleroi a few weeks later. In 1861, a year after the execution, 14 members of the infamous Black Gang were to appear before the same assize court. The leader of the gang, Leopold Rabet, confessed that French-speaking gang members had killed the widow Dubois. Jean-Baptiste Boucher and Auguste Leclercq confessed to having committed the murder and were sentenced to death. They also confessed that although Coucke and Goethals did not kill the widow, they were their accomplices. Aftermath On 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, Filip De Man directed a series of questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice, regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals. In 2000, Johan Vande Lanotte, Siegfried Bracke and Geert Goedertier had still written (in België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint, p. 27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder. In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a miscarriage of justice, as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a gendarme from Luxembourg, but a sworn translator of Dutch origin (Nederlandse afkomst). On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French- speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin. The Member of Parliament then asked whether the dossier of the trial case could be looked into by MPs or by civilians, and whether it corroborated the journalist's statements about Rabet, the interpreter, Goethals' confessions, and Coucke's financial situation. He also wished to know whether the nine death penalties of 17 January 1862 by the same court of which seven had been reduced, were connected to the Black Gang and thus to Boucher, Leclerq, and Rabet. Would the Minister of Justice in this case be willing to ask the advice of the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons, and to ask for the revision of the verdict of 1869, or to provide reasons for not asking the latter. The Minister replied one year later, on 24 July 2006. The confession of guilt by third parties can be considered as a new fact having taken place after the conviction, offering the possibility to review the case. The criticism and advises that several authors may have brought forward, do not form a ground for a revision. According to the Minister, of the mentioned elements, only the statement by Rabet form such a ground in as far it is of a nature that proves the innocence of the convicts and it has been made in circumstances giving credibility to that statement or confession. The mentioned information however, does not offer the possibility to assess the reality, the circumstances, and the reach of the declarations by Rabet. The dossier on the case can be viewed if the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons gives his permission, even in case it is in the National Archives as it is over a hundred years old.

Starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, the film follows an Interpol agent and an American district attorney who jointly investigate corruption within the IBBC, a fictional merchant bank based in Luxembourg. It serves organized crime and corrupt governments as a banker and as an arms broker. The bank's ruthless managers assassinate potential threats including their own employees. Inspired by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal of the 1980s, the film raises concerns about how global finance affects international politics across the world. Production began in Berlin in September 2008, including the construction of a life-size replica of New York's Guggenheim Museum for the film's central shootout scene. The film opened the 59th Berlin International Film Festival on 5 February 2009. The Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus praised the action sequences and locations but criticized the plot. Plot Louis Salinger, a British ex- Scotland Yard officer-turned Interpol detective, and Eleanor Whitman, an Assistant District Attorney from Manhattan, are investigating the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), which funds activities such as money laundering, terrorism, arms trading, and the destabilization of governments. Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them from Berlin to Milan, where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an Italian prime ministerial candidate. The bank's assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is promptly killed by a corrupt carabiniere. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the corrupt carabiniere shows up again and orders them out of the country. At the airport they are able to check the security camera footage for clues on the whereabouts on the bank's assassin, and follow a suspect to New York City. In New York, Salinger and Whitman are met by two New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives, Iggy Ornelas and Bernie Ward, who have a photograph of the assassin's face when he arrived in New York airport. Salinger, Ornelas, and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson to whose practice the assassin's leg brace has been traced. They find the assassin and follow him to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Jonas Skarssen, the chairman of the IBBC, reveals to his senior men White and Wexler that the bank had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy missile guidance systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler, Wexler. Wexler leaves and is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger and Ward speak to the assassin and attempt to arrest him, a shootout at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with automatic weapons. In the chaos Ward is killed, and Salinger is forced to team up with the assassin to fight off the gunmen. Despite escaping, the assassin is mortally wounded and dies of his injuries, thus losing another lead in Salinger's investigation. In interrogation, Wexler, a former Stasi colonel, explains to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable because of its utility to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down there are hundreds of other banks that will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. Salinger persuades Whitman to let him go on alone. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and transmit orders for White to be killed. Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen is buying the crucial components from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts to record the conversation so that he can obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing. During the closing credits, it is indicated that the bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite the death of its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, it is hinted that the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall, as shown by the last panel, revealing the beginnings of a United States Senate investigation, headed by Whitman.

A year later Tom Tykwer got involved through his agent, but decided a contemporary setting would work better. In April 2007, Clive Owen agreed to perform in The International. He said the script interested him because he was reminded of \\"those '70s paranoia pictures\\" and because it combined a factual, intelligent basis with an international thriller plot. The following July, actress Naomi Watts was cast opposite Owen. In August, the film received US$5.4 million from the toward its budget. The following month its funding increased to $7.9 million, based on the board's assessment that two-thirds of The International would be produced in Germany and that a number of Germans were in important roles, such as actors Armin Mueller-Stahl and Axel Milberg, cinematographer Frank Griebe, and production designer Uli Hanisch. Filming began in Berlin on 10 September 2007. Part of the production took place in Babelsberg Studios. Clive Owen called the shoot-out scene \\"one of the most exquisitely executed sequences I've been involved in\\". Tom Tykwer planned the scene in detail and toured the museum with the principals months in advance. The lobby entrance scene was filmed in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, but for the shooting sequences a wide, life-size replica, including an audio visual exhibition with works of Julian Rosefeldt, was built in Germany. This set was too large for the studio, so it was instead built in a disused locomotive warehouse outside Berlin; its construction took ten weeks. Having filmed in the real museum interior and on the sound stage in Germany, the film crew had to track the lights and camera angles carefully throughout to ensure continuity. The scene includes a sequence in which the protagonist sends a huge art-chandelier hanging from the ceiling crashing to the ground; the entire stunt was created using computer generated imagery. Themes Clive Owen, discussing the film's relevance, said it \\"ultimately does ask questions about whether banks use people's money appropriately, and if they're completely sound institutions.\\" More baldly put, Philip French, reviewing the film in The Observer, surmised the sentiment as \\"Let's kill all the bankers\\", a modern-day version of Dick the Butcher's \\"First thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers\\", from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part II. Salinger's (Owen) central revelation is that the world is governed by anonymous forces, staffed by disposable individuals. The powerlessness of the ordinary citizen is symbolised by the huge, impersonal buildings that the villains inhabit. The film draws on a number of macabre incidents from international banking: the Bank of Credit and Commerce International crisis in 1991; the murder of Roberto Calvi, an alleged banker to the Sicilian Mafia, in London in 1982; and the assassination by poisoning of Georgi Markov in London, in 1978. The bank is making large loans to rogue states and simultaneously acting as their munitions broker. The script offers the chilling insight that the creditors are the real winners of any conflict. A.O. Scott commented on the opportunity to make a film critical of international finance, \\"that multinational weapons manufacturers can be portrayed as more decent, civic- minded and principled than global financiers surely says something about the state of the world.\\" Reception =Box office= The International was first screened on 5 February 2009 at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival and was released in the United States and Canada on 13 February 2009. In a six-week run in America, it earned $25 million at the box office. It was released in Australia on 19 February and the United Kingdom on 27 February 2009. Its total theatrical earnings worldwide were $60,161,391. It was released in France under the title \\"L'Enquête\\" (\\"The Investigation\\") on 11 March 2009, it earned €264,054 during a three-week theatrical release. Reviewers called the film \\"topical\\" and \\"remarkably prescient\\", due to its release just after the financial crisis of 2007–08 during the start of the Great Recession. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on 9 June 2009. It contains a digital copy for portable devices. =Critical reception= , the film holds a 58% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 210 reviews and an average rating of 5.81 out of 10. The consensus statement reads: \\"The International boasts some electric action sequences and picturesque locales, but is undone by its preposterous plot.\\" Metacritic gives the film a 52% rating based on 34 reviews. In his review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, \\"I felt occasionally that Owen's rumpled performance is in danger of becoming a little one-note ... but this is still an unexpectedly well–made thriller with brainpower as well as firepower\\". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a \\"slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller\\" and the gunfight in the Guggenheim \\"spectacular\\". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, \\"It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat- footed Owen doesn't look as good as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace\\". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, \\"And there's a big hole in the middle of the movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings\\". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, \\"There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller- coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano- second.\\". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, \\"The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those that you wish another, more original director had tackled\\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"It's got some effective moments and aspects, but the film goes in and out of plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole\\". Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, \\"The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false\\". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \\"Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, but he has a quality that makes you worry a little about him\\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B–\\" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, \\"the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends\\". The film earned an average rating of three stars from five from French critics according to AlloCiné. Reviewing the film for Le Monde, which gave the film one star, Jacques Mandelbaum said that the modern, destructive forces of political fantasy and derivative finance which power the film's plot should have created sparks, \\"but in reality, the film trudges along. While the film constituted a thrilling geographic tour of the genre tropes, it forgot to focus on characters and mood.\\" References External links    Category:2009 films Category:2000s action drama films Category:2009 action thriller films Category:2000s political thriller films Category:American films Category:American action drama films Category:American action thriller films Category:American political thriller films Category:German films Category:German action drama films Category:German action thriller films Category:German political thriller films Category:Danish-language films Category:English-language films Category:French-language films Category:Italian-language films Category:Films set in Berlin Category:Films set in Istanbul Category:Films set in Lyon Category:Films set in Luxembourg Category:Films set in Milan Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Turkey Category:Atlas Entertainment films Category:Babelsberg Studio films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Relativity Media films Category:Films directed by Tom Tykwer Category:Films produced by Charles Roven Category:Films produced by Richard Suckle Category:Films scored by Tom Tykwer Category:Films scored by Reinhold Heil Category:Films scored by Johnny Klimek Category:2009 action films Category:2009 drama films ","title":"The International (2009 film)"},{"id":"12246743","text":"Boy Culture is a 1995 novel by Matthew Rettenmund.

Their models range from 34 feet to 52 feet with a portfolio of 7 models from the Carver 34 Coupe to the C52 Command Bridge. Their range of offerings continues to grow to serve the growing demand from a new generation of yachting enthusiasts. History Carver Yachts was founded in 1954 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin when Charles \\"Charlie\\" Carter and George Verhagen started building mahogany runabouts in a factory on South 27th. The popular myth that they started building boats in the backyard garage is not true. They were both long time marine industry people that decided to build boats rather than sell them through Carter's two marine dealerships in Green Bay and the Fox Valley. The pair later sold the business in 1963 to business partners Walter \\"Wally\\" Markham and Glen Nordin, both of whom had worked for Cruisers of Oconto, Wisconsin. Under their leadership the then-called Carver Boat Corporation transitioned to fiberglass based construction and expanded from a regional boat builder to an international company with worldwide sales. In the 1980s and 1990s, Carver was the largest manufacturer of fiberglass production yachts in the world. In 2004 Carver started the Marquis Yachts line, which began with the 59 and 65 Motor Yachts. Over 100 of the 65 Motor Yachts were built from 2005 to 2008 in Pulaski, Wisconsin. Carver Yachts was hit hard during the great recession from 2007 to 2009 and their parent company Genmar declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. During this period Carver never stopped building yachts. In 2010 Carver Yachts was restructured; 150 additional employees were hired and the company was given a substantial capital infusion by the current owners. Carver was acquired by Marquis-Larson boat group.

Boxing career The earliest contests of Sam Collyer differ from source to source. Some list different dates, locations and people for these bouts. It is certain however, that Collyer did battle, and defeat a man named Mike Carr in early 1866 .American Fistiana, 1866 The first significant contest of Collyer's career was his bout with Horatio \\"Race\\" Bolster. The two met in Alexandria, VA on May 8, 1866. During the contest, Bolster broke his hand, and was given a tremendous beating. The fight ended after 49 rounds and 55 minutes. Collyer ended the contest when he knocked his opponent off his feet, and Bolster's seconds threw in the towel.New York Herald, May 9, 1866 =Taking the American Lightweight Championship, June 1866= Later that year, Collyer battled former champion Young Barney Aaron for the vacant Lightweight Championship of America. The Title had been vacated since the retirement of Owney Geoghegan back in 1863. The Aaron/Collyer contest was held on June 20, 1866 at Pohick Landing, VA. The fierce battle was contested for 47 rounds taking 2 hours and 14 minutes before Collyer was declared the winner.New York Herald, June 12, 1866Original account of first fight with Collyer also in \\"The Prize Fight\\", The Evening Star, Washington, D.C., pg. 1, 14 June 1867 Below is an account of the last few rounds of the Collyer/Aaron fight as written in the New York Herald on June 21, 1866: Rounds 41 to 44—These rounds were merely repetitions of each other, Barney constantly going down on his knees, apparently for the purpose of receiving a foul blow and thereby winning the stakes. At the close of Round 47—He was entirely blind, and his seconds seeing that there was no possible chance of success and unwilling to subject a game man to further punishment threw up the sponge in token of defeat.New York Herald, June 21, 1866 On September 7, 1866 Collyer defended his title against Johnny Lafferty in a contest that lasted 39 rounds and 62 minutes (some sources report 60 minutes). His second defense came against Johnny McGlade at Goldsboro, PA on January 15, 1867. McGlade had suffered a severe fever while training, and was completely dominated during the contest.American Fistiana, 1867 The two battle for 47 rounds and 55 minutes in the sleet covered ring before McGlade's corner threw in the towel.Grand Rapids Herald, December 13, 1904 =Losing and reclaiming the American Lightweight Championship, June 1867= Collyer lost his title in a rematch with Young Barney Aaron on June 13, 1867. The two contested in a hard-fought battle for 68 rounds and 1 hour and 55 minutes at Aquia Creek in Northern Virginia. The fight began at 8:50 am, with around 1500 in attendance and was fought outdoors in an Amphitheater on the banks of Aquia Creek in Northern Virginia. Young Barney won the choice of position and wisely took the side of the ring not facing the sun. By the end of the bout, Collyer's eyes were closed causing his seconds to throw in the sponge. The bare-knuckled boxing was desperate and brutal and both boxers were down in various rounds. Immediately after winning the title, Young Barney Aaron took a long leave from the ring, leaving the crown open for Collyer to reclaim.Original account of first fight with Collyer in \\"The Prize Fight\\", The Evening Star, Washington, D.C., pg. 1, 14 June 1867 His bouts with Collyer were considered among his most memorable and significant.Second bout with Collyer appears in \\"The Prize Ring\\", The Evening Telegraph, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 13 June 1867 The first man to challenge his right to the title was Billy Kelly. Kelly was a gifted pugilist, and word of the battle quickly spread. The Collyer/Kelly contest was held on November 27, 1867 in Strickland, PA. Collyer pressed the fight from start to finish, and his opponent was forced into the defensive mode for nearly the entire bout. A total of 111 short rounds and 1 hour and fifty minutes were fought before the champion knocked his opponent down for the final time. Below is an account of the last three rounds (and conclusion) of the contest. They were documented in the New York Herald the day after the contest: Round 109—Collyer, determined to close fight before dark, rushed in [? ?] Kelly and struck him a right- hander over the left [?], then gave him the left on the nose, and again the right on the mouth, when Kelly went down. Round 110—Collyer led off with his left, which brought upon Kelly's nose, and then, putting in two heavy right- handers clinched, Kelly and threw him, falling heavily on him. Round 111 and Last—Collyer rushed at Kelly and hitting a heavy right-hander in the mouth knocked him down. The sponge was thrown up in token of defeat and Sam Collyer hailed the victor. Kelly, the game fellow, was much mortified at the result and shed tears. Collyer went over to him and putting his arms around him, also burst into tears. He then went around among the crowd and collected money for the man he had beaten in a fair fight for the championship of the lightweights of America.New York Herald, November 28, 1867 =Losing the American Lightweight Championship, April 1868= On August 24, 1868 Collyer lost his championship to Billy Edwards in 47 rounds. Collyer attempted to regain the title in a return match with Edwards on March 7, 1870. This time the former champion was forced to give in after 40 rounds. Following this contest, Collyer's status as a prize-fighter began to diminish. He lost a third contest with Edwards in 1874, and a bout with legendary undefeated lightweight champion Jack McAuliffe in 1888. His last recorded contest was in 1892. Later life After retirement Collyer began working as a machinist in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and remained there until his death on December 7, 1904. During his life he raised the teenage sons of his late brother, Henry Jamieson, and performed with the boys in Barnum and Bailey show.The Ring, January 1964 Legacy Collyer was elected into the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1964.

The Welsh-language edition, entitled Gwyddoniadur Cymru is regarded as the most ambitious encyclopaedic work to be published in Welsh since the 19th century. The English-language and Welsh-language editions were published simultaneously. Background Unlike the Welsh Encyclopedia, published in ten volumes, between 1854 and 1879, by Thomas Gee, the encyclopaedia is about only Wales. In this respect it is more like the Cymru: Yn Hanesyddol, Parthedegol, A Bywgraphyddol (\\"Wales: Historical, Regional, & Biographical\\"), edited by Owen Jones and published between 1871 and 1875. The encyclopaedia indexes 6,000 facts about Wales compiled by 400 researchers over ten years. Biographical articles are restricted to individuals no longer living. The editors are John Davies (consultant editor for both versions), Menna Baines (editor of the Welsh language version), Nigel Jenkins (editor of the English version) and Peredur Lynch. The project was started in January 1999 and the book eventually published January 2008, although 14 November 2007 was the original launch date. Funding for the project, which cost £300,000, came from the Literature Wales (formerly known as \\"the Academi\\"), University of Wales Press and also from the Arts Council of Wales lottery funding. Publishers claim they have included facts from every community in Wales. Ashley Drake of the University of Wales said that it is a \\"celebration of Wales and Welshness.

Member of a family of lawyers Trinity College, Cambridge, where Wylde was educated. He was the eldest son of Thomas Wilde 1758-1821(NSW), attorney of Saffron Walden and Warwick Square London, founder in 1785 of Wilde Sapte, very recently Denton Wilde Sapte and now the multinational law firm Dentons and Mary Anne, née Knight. Late in life Thomas Wilde, an amateur naturalist \\"of some distinction\\", retired and taking his piano, cello and flute followed his son John to Sydney, Australia where he died 4 December 1821. In February 1817 Thomas Wylde was elected to the first board of directors of the Bank of New South Wales. John Wylde's two younger brothers were: Thomas Wilde 1782-1855, first Lord Truro, Lord Chancellor of England' and Edward Archer Wilde 1786-1871, Solicitor of London who was father of, amongst others: James Plaisted Wilde, 1816-1899, first and last Lord Penzance; and General Sir Alfred Thomas Wilde, KCB CSI 1819-1878. Other 19th century Wildes, descendants of Thomas Wilde 1758-1821, were well-known London barristers and solicitors. Educated at St Paul's School in London, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, Wylde was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in 1805. It was at St. Benedict's, Cambridge, that Wylde married Elizabeth Jane, née Moore, on 16 July 1805, with whom he fathered nine children. She remained in Australia and they were divorced in 1836.  Deputy Judge Advocate of New South Wales  Having met with some success as a London barrister, in 1815 Wylde accepted the position of Deputy Judge Advocate of New South Wales, with a salary of approximately £1200 per annum. Wylde arrived in Sydney on 5 October of the following year on the ship Elizabeth. He was accompanied by his wife, six of his children, Joshua John Moore, his brother-in-law (who acted as Wylde's clerk), and his father, Thomas Wylde. Wylde, having considered Ellis Bent's recommendation for 'a professional person … as Clerk of the Peace' to help in his new judge advocate position, recommended his father for the role. Posted as the Deputy Judge Advocate of New South Wales, Wyldes duties proved widely varied and arduous, as he effectively simultaneously filled the roles of committing magistrate, public prosecutor and judge. Despite the apparent complexity and difficulty of his position, Wylde discharged his duties faithfully and properly, and at times, revolutionised several of the statutes of the courts and legal system in the new colony; he did not allow convict attorneys to practise in his court, oversaw the establishment of a supreme court in Van Diemen's Land and revised the port regulations of Ellis Bent. In 1821, Wylde sent a report of the judicial and legal state and process of establishment in the new colony to Commissioner John Bigge. This report described at length the need for the laws of New South Wales to be modified so that they would be in near parallel with those of England. This report, along with Wylde's way of handling his many judicial duties, his suggestions and, at times, even Wylde himself, were fiercely criticised in a confidential letter from Bigge to Henry Bathurst on 9 September 1822. The criticism was so intense and detailed, that it was considered by many to be overly harsh. After a farewell speech at the final sitting of the Governor's Court in May 1824, in which he strongly defended himself, Wylde left his post. His legal career continued however, and in March 1824 he became a judge of the supreme court, until 17 May, when Francis Forbes opened a new Supreme Court which superseded the one Wylde was at, and Wylde's work there ceased.  Chief Justice of the Cape Colony  Wylde sailed to England in 1825, was knighted in 1827 and was then appointed Chief Justice of the new court of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He remained in this position for the rest of his career. He presided over the abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834, and over the beginnings of representative government in the early 1850s. While his work was, according to contemporary accounts, of the highest quality, his public life was beset with scandals. He retired in 1855, following a stroke.K McKenzie: Scandal in the Colonies: Sydney and Cape Town, 1820-1850. Melbourne University Publishing, 2005.  Personal life  Wylde had and received many land grants, including over 800 hectares of land at Cabramatta, and over 50 hectares in Potts Point. At Pott's Point Wylde built a palatial home where he lived in for many years. Wylde founded what would become a renowned and respected horse stud, became the president of the Benevolent Society, and enjoyed reading the classics. Wylde also had a love of music, and had a piano imported to New South Wales. Among his most treasured musical instruments were a century-old cello and a flute. He was also known to be a very devoted parent. Wylde died on 13 December 1859. He never left South Africa after being appointed chief justice in Cape Town. A portrait of him, painted in 1827 by Martin Shee, is at Parliament House, Cape Town.

After Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), in 618 in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji, the Sui officials at the eastern capital Luoyang supported Emperor Yang's grandson, Yang Tong (the Prince of Yue), as emperor, but the official Wang Shichong seized the throne in 619, ending Sui and establishing his own state of Zheng. Wang made Zhang his minister of census.  During Emperors Gaozu's and Taizong's reigns  In 621, Wang Shichong's Zheng state was destroyed by forces from the faction that would later become the Tang dynasty. As Zhang had been a Sui official before, he was made the sheriff of Gushou County (穀熟, in modern Shangqiu, Henan). Later, after he passed an imperial examination, he was made the secretary general of Fuping County (富平, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), and was considered capable in his position. After his term of office was over, he was made an assistant imperial censor, and was known for willing to submit accusations against other officials for misbehavior notwithstanding their honorable positions. The second Tang emperor, Emperor Taizong, the reigning emperor at the time, was impressed by him, and stated to his chancellor Fang Xuanling, \\"In both history and current times, officials often came into their offices due to recommendations by others. But I selected Zhang Xincheng myself, without anyone else's recommendations.\\" On one occasion, possibly in 627, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial feast, began to talk about differences between people from the Guanzhong region and those from the Shandong region (i.e., those from east of modern Sanmenxia, Henan, not those from modern Shandong), Zhang found the talk to be inappropriate, and stated, \\"Your subject has heard that the Son of Heaven should view the entire empire as his home, and should not divide it through geographical limitations; if you do so, you will show prejudice.\\" Emperor Taizong was impressed, and awarded Zhang a horse, a set of clothing, and money. He also began to consult Zhang on important matters and promoted Zhang to the post of imperial attendant. In 641, Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, made the comment, \\"Although I am the lord of the empire, but I also often have to serve as general and chancellor.\\" After Zhang withdrew from Emperor Taizong's presence, he submitted a note indicating his belief that the comment was inappropriate—noting that it sounded like he was arguing over achievements with his subjects. Emperor Taizong approved of his comment. By 643, when Emperor Taizong deposed his eldest son and crown prince Li Chengqian (over Li Chengqian's plotting to overthrow him) and replaced him with Li Zhi, Zhang was the assistant minister of justice. Emperor Taizong, when selecting staff members for Li Zhi, selected Zhang as an assistant head of the crown prince's household. In 645, during Emperor Taizong's campaign against Goguryeo, Emperor Taizong left Li Zhi at Zhang's home, Ding Prefecture, to be in charge of logistics, assisted by a number of officials led by the chancellor Gao Shilian, and Zhang was a member of Li Zhi's staff there.The New Book of Tang indicated that Zhang was made a de facto chancellor at this point. See New Book of Tang, vol. 61. If true, this appeared to be no longer the case after the end of the Goguryeo campaign, and could have been simply a temporary measure during the Goguryeo campaign, as he was not referred to as chancellor again until 649 when he was made the head of the examination bureau. Li Zhi told Zhang, \\"This gives you a chance to return home in honor.\\" He also gave Zhang supplies to allow him to worship his ancestors, and Zhang took this opportunity to recommend a number of scholars from his home, and while Li Zhi rejected making them officials (on the account that they were too old in age), he gave them rewards. After Emperor Taizong returned to the capital Chang'an after the Goguryeo campaign, he had Zhang serve as surveyor of the Henan region, and after that tour made him the acting assistant head of the executive bureau of government. In 646, Emperor Taizong, in the aftermaths of the collapse of Tang's one-time vassal and adversary Xueyantuo to the north, went to the important northern defense prefecture of Ling Prefecture (靈州, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), to try to affirm the faith of the former vassals of Xueyantuo, who were by now directly Tang vassals. Initially, he was taking Li Zhi with him, but Zhang submitted a petition stating that this would better serve as an opportunity for Li Zhi to serve as regent at Chang'an, so that he could become familiar with imperial governance. Emperor Taizong agreed, and rewarded Zhang by giving him the honorific title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu ().  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  In 649, Emperor Taizong became ill and died in Cuiwei Palace () after entrusting Li Zhi to two chancellors, Li Zhi's maternal uncle, Zhangsun Wuji, and Chu Suiliang. Keeping the news of Emperor Taizong's death secret, Zhangsun and Chu accompanied Li Zhi and Emperor Taizong's casket back to Chang'an and, after carrying out a number of official commissions, including commissioning Zhang Xingcheng as Shizhong () —the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor—announced Emperor Taizong's death. With Zhang and fellow chancellor Gao Jifu physically assisting him, Li Zhi took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong). He enfeoffed Zhang as the Duke of Beiping and made him one of the officials in charge of editing imperial history. In 651, Zhang was made a head of the executive bureau, also considered a post for a chancellor, although he also carried a secondary title as de facto chancellor. In 652, when Emperor Gaozong appointed his eldest son, Li Zhong, crown prince, Zhang received the additional title as an advisor to the crown prince. He died in 653. After Emperor Gaozong's death in 684, Zhang was one of the officials enshrined into Emperor Gaozong's temple.

Flatten it out into a 1 cm (1/8 in) thick disk. Place a mung bean ball in the center. Pinch the edges together to seal. Try to avoid gaps between the dough and the filling ball. Roll between the palms to form a smooth ball. Place the glutinous balls on a baking sheet or a greased plate to avoid sticking. # To cook the dumplings, bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Gently drop in the balls and cook on medium heat until they float to the surface (about 5 mins). Transfer the cooked dumplings into a bowl of cold water. # To make the ginger syrup, in a large sauce pan, combine water, sugar, salt and ginger and bring to a boil. Then simmer on medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes so that ginger infuses the syrup. Transfer the cooked dumplings to the syrup and sprinkle roasted sesame on top. # To make \\"bánh trôi\\", use diced cane sugar as filling instead of mung bean paste.

The Gilt Bronzes from Cartoceto di Pergola are the only surviving Roman gilt bronze equestrian group. The monumental ensemble was composed of at least two knights, of which only one remains, atop their horses, and two women standing. The statues are thought most likely to date between 50 and 30 BC and depict members of a prestigious local family. They were found not far from the intersection of the Via Flaminia and the Via Salaria Gallica in central Italy, in an isolated location, far from urban centres. Because of its extraordinary archaeological importance, the group has been at the centre of a long controversy between the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici delle Marche and the municipality of Pergola over the location where the bronzes would be preserved. The group was on display at the National Archeological Museum of the Marche, in Ancona, until 1972,Stucchi, S. (1960). Gruppo bronzeo di cartoceto gli elementi al museo di Ancona. Bollettino d'Arte 4(J5), 7-44. when it was moved to the Museo dei Bronzi dorati della città di Pergola, built specifically for this purpose. A compromise solution now moves the original bronzes and replicas between the two sites. Description ;Horsemen :The best-preserved horseman is a mature man (about 40 years of age), whose clothes (the paludamentum and tunic) identify him as a high-ranking military officer in time of peace, consistent with the position of the right arm, raised in the symbol of peace. Fragments only remain of the other horseman. ;Women :The surviving standing figure depicts an elderly woman, whose hellenistic hairstyle, typical of the second half of the first century, suggests dating the group accordingly.Kousser, R. (2008). Hellenistic and Roman Ideal Sculpture: The Allure of the Classical (Cambridge University Press). The woman wears a stole and palla. The other female figure is substantially less preserved, as only the lower portions of her body have survived. ;Horses :The horses are presented with a raised front leg, which suggests a walking motion. The figures of a triton and a nereid, alongside seahorses and dolphins, adorn each pectoral plate. The harnesses are enriched by metal phaleras on which images of various gods are placed to protect the steed and its owner, including Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Juno, Minerva, and Mercury.  Techniques and materials  The statues were made by using the lost-wax casting method and are composed primarily of a copper alloy with traces of lead; After assembly, the statues were gilded with gold leaf.Rolley, C. (1998). Les bronzes grecs et romains: recherches récentes. Revue archéologique, 291-310.Nastasi, I. Utilizzo delle tecniche diagnostiche per lo studio di reperti archeologici. (Tesionline). A replica intended to reproduce the bronzes' original state is displayed on the roof of the Palazzo Ferretti (site of the National Archaeological Museum of the Marche) in celebration of local archaeology.  Discovery and restoration  In June and July 1946, hundreds of gilt bronze fragments, weighing hundreds of kilograms, were accidentally discovered in Santa Lucia di Calamello, in Cartoceto di Pergola (Province of Pesaro and Urbino), central Italy. Canon Giovanni Vernarecci, who was at the time the archaeological inspector for the district of Fossombrone, detailed the circumstances of his fortuitous discovery in a typewritten account. The bronzes were recovered by Vernarecci and Nereo Alfieri, who was the Marche regional inspector of the governmental antiquity department (Soprintendenza alle Antichità delle Marche). 318 fragments were placed together in an attempt to recreate the original statues,Greco, G. (1987). Bronzi dorati da Cartoceto: un restauro (Cantini). and the group was restored in several spurts between 1949 and 1988.  Original placement of the group  The fragments were uncovered not far from the intersection of the Via Flaminia and the Via Salaria Gallica, which is an isolated location, far from urban centres. This unusual collocation has led archaeologists to conjecture that the group was likely removed from its original position and set aside sometime in late antiquity or in Byzantine times  some suggesting that this may have been the result of a damnatio memoriae.Archeologia nelle Marche, Mario Luni, 2003, The bronzes' original placement in an urban context is still uncertain. The most accepted hypothesis suggests that the group may have originally rested on a base in some public area (probably the forum of a Roman city near the discovery site). Notable candidates are the Forum Sempronii (Fossombrone),Luni, M. (2007). Domus di Forum Sempronii: decorazione e arredo (L'Erma di Bretschneider). which was closest, Sentinum (Sassoferrato), where the existence a foundry for large statues has been attested, or Suasa, because other large fragments of a similar gilt bronze horse were found there (on display at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, see photos and ).  Identification  The group is composed of two horsemen, two women, and two horses. The characters represented likely belonged to a single family of senatorial rank, but certain identification of the subjects has eluded archaeologists. Some have proposed that the group may depict the imperial family of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, which would date the statues to 20-30 AD; the horsemen are thought to be Nero and Drusus Caesar, sons of Germanicus, while the women would be Livia (Germanicus' grandmother) and Agrippina (Germanicus' wife). More likely, however, the statues date between 50 and 30 BC and depict members of a prestigious legate's family from the territory in which they were discovered, the Ager Gallicus. Several candidate families have been proposed, including that of Domitius Ahenobarbus, as well as those of Marcus Satrius (senator representing Sentinum) and Lucius Minucius Basilus (born in nearby Cupra Maritima, modern Cupra Marittima, and amidst the senators who killed Julius Caesar).Del Francia, P. R. (1979). The equestrian group from Cartoceto. The Horses of San Marco, Venice, 42-43. A further hypothesis proposes that the group may have originally been placed in the Heraion of Samos Island, and that the subjects are the family of Marcus Tullius Cicero, who would be one of the horsemen.di Caprio, N.C.

He compiled an 8–7 win–loss record and a 4.95 earned run average (ERA) in 54 major league games. He also played seven years in the minor leagues and played college baseball at Cornell University. Early years Olsen was born in South Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1894. He graduated from Norwalk High School in 1913 and then attended Cornell University where he played for the Cornell Big Red baseball team. His college career was interrupted by military service during World War I. After being discharged from the military, he returned to Cornell and served as the captain of Cornell's baseball team in 1919. Professional baseball Olsen debuted with the Tigers in 1922, appearing in 37 games — 15 as a starter and 22 as a reliever. He compiled a record of 7-6 with five complete games with a 4.53 earned run average (ERA). In 1923, he appeared in 17 games, only two as a starter, and had a record of 1-1 with an ERA of 6.31. Interviewed in 1976, Olsen recalled striking out Babe Ruth on June 14, 1922, with two runners on base and the Tigers leading, 4-2. Olsen recalled that, when Babe stepped to the plate, he tried to rattle the rookie pitcher by calling him an SOB and telling him to \\"throw the ball and duck.\\" Olsen responded by calling Babe \\"a big baboon\\" and striking him out. An account in The New York Times confirms that Olsen struck out Ruth with two men on base in the bottom of the fifth inning and with the Tigers leading, 4-2. Olsen also pitched for seven years in the minor leagues, including stints with the Syracuse Stars of the International League in 1921 and 1926, the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association in 1924, the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association in 1924 and 1925, the Kansas City Blues of the American Association from 1925 to 1927, and the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in 1928 and 1929.

It corresponded to the territory of Alsace and was carved out of southern Austrasia in the last decade of the reign of Dagobert I, probably to stabilise the southern reaches of Austrasia against Alemannia and Burgundy. By the late Middle Ages, the region was considered part of Swabia. Foundation The term \\"Alsace\\" derives from the Germanic ali-land-sat-ja, meaning \\"one who sits in another land.\\" Alsace was Alemanni territory, but not so much as Alemannia proper, which was east of the Rhine: it was, however, the \\"other\\" land in which some Alemanni had settled. In the late Roman Empire, a district of Alsace (pagus Alsatiae) had been established in the region. Under Chlothar II, Alsace and Alemannia were granted their own law, the Pactus Alamannorum. In 596, Childebert II bequeathed Alsace to his son Theuderic II, who was raised there. This attached it to Burgundy, but in 610 Theudebert II, Theuderic's brother of Austrasia, forced Alsace' cession to him only to lose it two years later to Burgundy again. In 623, when Chlothar II granted Austrasia to Dagobert, he excluded Alsace, the Vosges, and the Ardennes, but was shortly after forced to concede it to Dagobert by the Austrasian nobility. Sometime probably between 629 and 631 Dagobert granted it as a dukedom to Gundoin, a Frank from the Austrasian heartland of the Meuse valley, a move which tied Alsace more closely to the Austrasian court. Gundoin's duchy comprised both sides of the Vosges, the Burgundian Gate, and the Transjura; there were to be continuous early problems retaining the faithfulness of the Sundgau. Etichonid duchy The creation of a duchy of Alsace corresponded with the creation of counties in the region. Thitherto counties had not been found in most of Austrasia, but by the eighth century they were common in the south. The counts of Alsace were known in contemporary Latin texts by the title (plural ), which may have indicated a slightly different office from that of the traditional (plural ), which was used in the more Romanised parts of Gaul. Alsace about 1000, divided into Nordgau and Sundgau Under Gundoin's successors, the famous Etichonids, the counties  Alsace was already generally divided into a Nordgau and Sundgau  were brought under direct ducal control. From the very beginning, Gundoin had used monasteries and monastic foundation as tools in spreading his authority and in developing his regional economy by employing the industry of monks for secular benefit. Alsace was first spoken of as a in the 730s, though the correspondence of Alsace with the territory of the early can be inferred quite easily (for example, known dukes of Alsace referring to earlier dukes as their predecessors can only mean that the territorial unit of rule was the same). The term , \\"Duchy of Alsace\\", only came into use under Louis the Pious, though there exists disputed evidence of its use as early as 735-737\\\\. Later history Following the suppression of the Alemanni in 742-746 by Carloman, son of Charles Martel, the duchy of Alsace was dissolved in 742 when a successor for the deceased Duke Liutfrid was not named. While some historians have suggested an antipathy between the Etichonids and the Arnulfings to explain the dissolution of their power in Alsace, the Etichonids were allies with the Charles Martel as early as the 720s, when he campaigned against the Alemanni, who were a constant thorn in the side of their Alsatian cousins. Some have interpreted the tripartite web of support between Alsatian monasteries, the Etichonid dukes and counts, and Theuderic IV as evidence of an attempt to stay outside of Arnulfing (subsequently Carolingian) control. In 722, Martel first defeated the Alemanni and in 744 some rebellious Alemans invaded Alsace, implying that it was considered loyal to Martel's successors, Carloman and Pepin the Short. Even Liutfrid himself may have died fighting on behalf of the Carolingians against the Alemanni. In any case, the peaceful dissolution of the duchy in Alsace mirrored the similar efforts of the Carolings elsewhere (notably Provence), while it was also part of a larger effort  which was notably violent in Alemannia and Aquitaine  to replace dukes, who had the power to command armies, with counts, who were royal officers responsible to and representative of royal power. Alsace remained a distinct unit after 742. With the rise in influence of Hugh of Tours, who was a conscious ancestor of the Etichonid dukes, Louis the Pious first made reference to the ducatus alsicensi in 816, though it was still a ducatus without a dux. In 829, Louis's youngest son, Charles, was made duke of Alsace, Alemannia and Rhaetia, but in 831 his share of the empire was expanded and was made into a kingdom. By the Treaty of Verdun (843) it was made part of the kingdom of Middle Francia under Lothair I, to the displeasure of Louis the German, who would have liked to see it attached to Alemanni in his East Francia. Upon Lothair's death in 855, Alsace became a part of Lotharingia in the threefold division of Middle Francia. Lothair II, because of his kinship with the still-powerful Etichonids, had firm support in Alsace throughout his tumultuous reign. In 867, he created the first Duke of Alsace in over a century when he granted the ducatum Elisatium to his illegitimate son Hugh, who had an ancient Etichonid name. In 869, Lothair granted protection of his kingdom to Louis the German immediately before his death on a trip to Rome. When Louis fell ill later that year, Charles, now king of all West Francia, tried to annex Alsace and made Hugh swear allegiance to him, but Louis recovered and by the Treaty of Meerssen (870) Alsace was attached to East Francia at long last. There is little evidence for an Alsatian dukedom after that, though some have interpreted references to an Uto dux in 999 as implying that the ducatus Elisatium was still not attached to the Duchy of Swabia by then. It eventually would be, however.

She began her musical career in 1992 when she founded, along with Ifat Netz and Yael Cohen, the band Ha- Mechashefot. She continued producing solo works and numerous collaborations, both in Israel and abroad. Perlmuter died in a car accident at the age of 26. HaMechashefot The band began to perform in clubs around Israel, and got public notice on a TV show called \\"Songs of the Sea of Galilee\\", hosted by Naomi Shemer. Ha-Mechashefot performed a sensual version the classic song Kesem 'Al Yam Kinneret (\\"Magic on the Sea of Galilee\\") which astounded both the audience and the host. This version was recorded in April 1993, and was released as a DJ record with cover art by Perlmuter. In early 1994, the band released its first album, Ad Ha-Oneg Ha-Ba (Till the Next Pleasure). Perlmuter wrote the lyrics and composed nearly all the songs. Thanks to Corinne Allal's arrangement and production, the band succeeded in creating an energetic guitar rock album which gained immense popularity and was certified gold. Following the album's release, the band had dozens of concerts. Some of them were held on Friday the 13th under the title \\"The Night of the Witches\\", and featured guest singers Corinne Allal and Dana Berger. In March/April 1995, Ha- Mechashefot released its second album, Zmanim Muzarim (Strange Times). This time they arranged and produced the entire album themselves. Again, Perlmuter wrote all the lyrics and composed all but one song. The album was less popular than their first. The band continued holding concerts frequently and was a warm-up act for Björk's show in Israel. In January 1996 Inbal and Israeli musician Ram Orion recorded in London the lo-fi album Inballance, which remained unreleased until 2016. In April 1996, the band released its third album, Ha-Mechashefot Mitkasot (The Witches Cover Up), a collection of all the cover songs they recorded in their early days. The album included a version of Shivers on which Nick Cave participated as guest vocalist. Annie Lennox of Eurythmics had refused to allow the band's version of her song \\"Sweet Dreams\\" to be released on the album. In protest, Perlmuter distributed the song on an underground cassette; the cover, which she had designed, bore the words \\"Shit Rights\\". After the release of this album, Ha-Mechashefot became considerably less active, although they never officially announced that they were disbanding. Their final concert was in September 1996. A comeback concert was planned for October 2, 1997 at the Logus club in Tel Aviv. The day before the concert, Perlmuter was driving to her parents' house for a holiday dinner, when her car veered off the road and hit a small residential building at Rishon LeZion interchange. She was killed instantly. A postmortem examination found no alcohol or other drugs. Haklatot ahronot (Last Recordings), an album of Perlmuter's preliminary recordings, was released posthumously in 1998.

Ross Macdonald Santa Teresa was created by Ross Macdonald as a fictionalised version of Santa Barbara, California, in his mystery The Moving Target (1949). He used it again in several others of his works, including The Galton Case (1959), The Instant Enemy (1968), and The Underground Man (1971). Sue Grafton In the 1980s, the writer Sue Grafton began using a fictional Santa Teresa as the setting for her novels featuring her lead character Kinsey Millhone, a fictional female private investigator. Millhone is the protagonist of Grafton's \\"alphabet mysteries\\" series of novels. Grafton chose the setting as a tribute to Macdonald, an acknowledged influence. In the Kinsey Millhone version, the town has a population of 85,000 and has a small airport. Nearby, Grafton describes a fictional “luxury residential development” laid out on a sprawling expanse of land called Horton Ravine, which “once belonged to one family, but is now divided into million-dollar parcels”. Although the fictional private investigator Kinsey Millhone acknowledges that “rich is rich”, she contrasts “‘new’ money” Horton Ravine to the “‘old’ money” graciousness of nearby Montebello, a thinly-disguised tribute to real-life Montecito, California. Roberto Bolaño Roberto Bolaño set his novel 2666 (2004) primarily in a northern Mexican city called Santa Teresa.

Located on the upper floors of the Palazzo dei Priori, the exhibition spaces occupy two floors and the collection comprises the greatest representation of the Umbrian School of painting, ranging from the 13th to the 19th century, strongest in the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries. The collection is presented in 40 exhibition rooms in the Palazzo. On the second floor of the Gallery, there is an exhibition space for temporary collections, changed several times a year.  History  The collection's origins lie in the foundation of the Perugian Accademia del Disegno in the mid-16th century. The Academy was originally based in the Convento degli Olivetani at Montemorcino, where it began to assemble a collection of paintings and drawings. The town became part of the French department of Trasimène in 1798 and its religious houses were suppressed. This suppression was repeated by the united Kingdom of Italy from the 1860s onwards - both suppressions shifted a large number of paintings and artworks from church to state ownership. In 1863, the civic paintings collection was formally named after Pietro Vannucci, but the problem of establishing an appropriate site to house the collection was not solved until 1878, when it moved into the third floor of the Palazzo dei Priori in the town centre. With the addition of acquisitions, donations and bequests, the pinacoteca became the Regia Galleria Vannucci in 1918, under the patronage of the king. The name was later changed to Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria. Over the years the entire complex of Palazzo dei Priori has been repeatedly affected by renovations and functional adaptation. The museum path, inaugurated in its current form in 2006, occupies an area of 4000 square meters on two floors. Collections Chronologically ordered, the permanent collection has Renaissance and Medieval paintings and sculptures from Italian artists such as Arnolfo di Cambio, Nicola Pisano, Giovanni Pisano, Duccio, Gentile da Fabriano, Fra Angelico, Benozzo Gozzoli, Giovanni Boccati and Piero della Francesca.

Partenheimer also remained active in baseball, having affiliations with Mansfield Little League, the Gordon Drug Aces, the Akron Jays, Sohio Athletic Club and the Killian Celtics. Partenheimer was married to Mary D. Stanwood, and they had two sons, Stanwood and Harold.

He played professional baseball as an outfielder and a catcher for 17 years from 1909 to 1925, including parts of three seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1913 and the Washington Senators from 1915 to 1916. He also played in all or parts of 12 seasons with the Minneapolis Millers in the American Association. Early years Rondeau was born in Danielson, Connecticut, in 1887. He played baseball as a boy in Danielson and began playing organized baseball as a second baseman for the Perseverance team out of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, in the Mill League. Professional baseball =Minor leagues= In 1909, while playing for the Perseverance team, Rondeau was discovered by Jesse Burkett and signed to play with his Worcester Busters team in the New England League. He played for Worcester, principally as a first baseman but also as an outfielder, in 1909 and 1910. Late in the 1910 season, after injuries to the Worcester catchers, Burkett moved Rondeau to that position. In 1911, he was sold to the Providence Grays in the Eastern League. After the 1911 season, he was traded to the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League. He compiled a .311 batting average in 90 games for the Skeeters. =Detroit Tigers= On September 16, 1912, Rondeau was drafted by the Washington Senators in the Rule 5 draft, but the Senators then sold him to the Detroit Tigers two days later for $4,000. After watching him earn the backup catcher position during spring training, E. A. Batchelor of the Detroit Free Press described Rondeau as a \\"scrappy\\" player who regularly engaged in heated dialogue with umpires over ball and strike calls – a fighting spirit that Batchelor concluded would make Rondeau valuable to the Tigers. Rondeau appeared in 36 games for the 1913 Detroit Tigers, including 12 games as the team's starting catcher and four games as the starting first baseman. He compiled a .186 batting average with the Tigers. In August 1913, he suffered sun stroke and was hospitalized for several days. =Minneapolis= After his release from the hospital, he was traded by the Tigers to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. He hit .378 for Minneapolis in 19 games at the end of the 1913 season and continued to play well for Minneapolis in 1914, appearing in 150 games with a .308 batting average and .412 on-base percentage. He was converted from a catcher to an outfielder in July 1914 by Minneapolis manager Joe Cantillon. =Washington Senators= In August 1914, the Millers traded Rondeau to Washington Senators. Clark Griffith of the Senators parted with four major league players in exchange for Rondeau, making him the most expensive recruit for the 1915 Senators. Rondeau appeared in only 14 games with the Senators in 1915, 11 as the team's starting left fielder and the others as a pinch-hitter, as his batting average plummeted to a career low .175 against big league pitching. On May 10, 1915, after a poor performance in his tryout with the Senators, Rondeau was sold by the Senators to the Minneapolis Millers. Clark Griffith stated at the time that he had given Rondeau a fair trial. He compiled a .333 batting average in 129 games for the Millers. After another strong season with Minneapolis, Rondeau returned to the Senators in 1916. He appeared in 50 games, 33 as a left fielder and 17 as a right fielder, and compiled a .222 batting average and .311 on-base percentage. He appeared in his last major league game on July 1, 1916. On July 5, 1916, Rondeau was returned to the Millers. In three major league seasons, Rondeau had a .206 batting average and .311 on-base percentage in 99 games and 272 at bats. He played 59 of his major league games as an outfielder and 16 games as a catcher. As of the end of the 2015 season, Rondeau is the only major league baseball player in history named \\"Henri\\".A search of the Baseball-Reference.com web site reveals only one player named \\"Henri\\". =Minneapolis= Rondeau returned in July 1916 for a third run with Minneapolis in between stints with the Washington Senators. This time, Rondeau remained with the Millers as a starting outfielder for nine more years, running through the 1924 season. He compiled a career high .382 batting average in 16 games during the 1916 season. In all, he batted over .300 seven times for the Millers: .382 in 1916, .378 in 1913, .333 in 1915 and 1920, .312 in 1923, .308 in 1914, and .302 in 1924. Rondeau was one of 42 players from 1902 to 1952 to play in 10 or more seasons as a member of the American Association.American Association Almanac at www.americanassociationalmanac.com Minnesota manager Joe Cantillon in 1921 referred to Rondeau as \\"an institution\\" with the team. =Little Rock and Hartford= After leaving the Millers, Rondeau played one more minor league season in 1925, splitting the season between the Little Rock Travelers and the Hartford Senators. On September 1, 1925, while playing for Hartford, he collapsed during the eighth inning of a game and was carried to the clubhouse by his fellow players. A doctor stated that Rondeau had suffered a heart attack. Later years Rondeau died in 1943 after a long illness at age 56 at his home in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He was buried at Precious Blood Cemetery in Woonsocket.

Early life  Rodgers was born in North Queensland and spent his early years there.  Education  Rodgers was awarded the 1983 Vada Jefferies Prize Griffith University Queensland Conservatorium of Music. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music from the Queensland Conservatorium of Music in 1984.  Career  Rodgers had an early background in classical music. He played with the Australian Youth Orchestra in 1980 -1982 (Violin 1) and in 1983-1984 (Violin) was leader. During this time they performed in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and in 1984 undertook a tour of European Festivals. He played with the Queensland Theatre Orchestra, and the Hunter Orchestra. With these and other orchestras, he toured Europe and Asia, often appearing as a soloist on violin. Rodgers chose not to follow the path that led to a career in classical music, instead forming controversial sex-and-death cult rock band Madam Bones Brothel with Pearly Black and together they released a CD Family of Abjects in 1994. He later played improvised music in ensembles such as The John Rodgers Trio and Artisan's Workshop early 1990s. Rodgers has been a contributor to the Australian Art Orchestra and was its Associate Artistic Director in 2005. He has worked with the New York performance artist Penny Arcade (Vienna Festival 1997), the Robyn Archer band and many of Australia's leading musicians and artists. He has performed solo concerts in the Adelaide Festival and the Melbourne Summer Music Festival. Rodgers has produced many works in fields including music theatre and new media. He has performed and recorded with the Antripodean Collective over a number of years. In 2011 John Shand in the Sydney Morning Herald said of the collective, \\"[it] stands in the forefront of the world's improvisers ... shared harmonic and rhythmic conceptions and vocabularies ... For the listener, the upshot is moments of stunning confluence materialising from nowhere and an intriguing dichotomy between the intellectual and the aesthetic, the conceptual and the visceral.\\" In 2012 he performed at the Powerhouse in Dangling my Tootsies a show featuring the \\"songs and sites of cabaret legend Agnes Bernelle\\", He has performed with number of artists both on recordings and live including William Barton on Birdsong at Dusk CD) , Kate Miller-Heidke at the Powerhouse and Resonance Festival (2012) where he composed and performed Hear me, and Remember. From 2012-2014 he was with Metro Arts Work in Residence Programme where he composed, Madame Carandini’s Travelling Musical Curiosity Show, described as \\"a gothic new music theatre work\\".  Reviews  In a series of three concerts, Life and Music (2013) at the University of Queensland, Rodger was described as, \\" prolific and eclectic composer, arranger and improviser ... [he] is an award winning musician, composer and creator of shows.

It is a perennial herb in the lizard tail family (Saururaceae) and prefers very wet soil or shallow water.Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains, Nancy Dale, 2nd Ed., 2000, p. 175 Range and habitat It is native to southwestern North America in northwest Mexico and the Southwestern United States from California to Oklahoma and Texas to Kansas to Oregon. Description =Leaves and Stems= As it matures, the visible part of the plant develops red stains, eventually turning bright red in the fall.Medicinal Plants of the SW - Anemopsis californica , retrieved on July 17, 2007. =Inflorescence and fruit= Yerba mansa is showy in spring when in bloom. The iconic white \\"flowers\\" (actually reduced inflorescences, or pseudanthia) are borne in early spring, and are surrounded by 4–9 large white bracts. Similar to the sunflower family, what appears to be a single bloom is in reality a dense cluster of individually small flowers borne in an inflorescence. In this species the inflorescence is conical and has five to ten large white bracts beneath it, so that along with the tiny white florets, the whole structure is quite striking when it blooms in spring. The conical structure develops into a single, tough fruit that can be carried downstream to spread the tiny, pepper-like seeds.http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?7085,7086,7087 Jepson Manual Treatment Common name In her book on herbs of the southwestern USA, Dr. Soule discusses the common name. \\"Yerba mansa is one of those names which confounds linguists. Yerba is Spanish for herb, and thus one would think that mansa is also from Spanish as well, but all indications point to the fact that it is not. Mansa means tame, peaceful, calm in Spanish, and the plant has no sedative effect, nor did local people ever use it as a calming agent. Its primary use is as an antimicrobial, antibacterial, and antifungal. The most likely explanation is that mansa is a Spanish alteration of the original native word for the plant, now lost in the depths of time.\\"Quoted here by permission of the author: Soule, J. A. 2011. Father Kino's Herbs: Growing and Using Them Today. Tierra del Sol Press, Tucson, AZ. Hartweg, who collected it at León, Guanajuato in 1837, recorded the local name as '.G. Bentham. Plantas Hartwegianas.(1839)p. 30 It is also known as yerba del manso in northern Baja California. The word \\"manso\\" could be short for \\"remanso\\" (backwater) which would agree with the areas where the plant thrives. Uses =Medicinal= Yerba mansa is used as an antimicrobial, an antibacterial, and to treat vaginal candidiasis.Anemopsis californica - Plants For A Future database report, retrieved on July 17, 2007 Yerba mansa is used to treat inflammation of the mucous membranes, swollen gums and sore throat. An infusion of roots can be taken as a diuretic to treat rheumatic diseases like gout by ridding the body of excess uric acid, which causes painful inflammation of the joints. Yerba mansa prevents the buildup of uric acid crystals in the kidneys which could cause kidney stones if left untreated. A powder of dried root can be sprinkled on infected areas to alleviate athlete's foot or diaper rash.Kay, M.A. Healing with Plants in the American and Mexican West. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ, 1996.Sencoval, Annette. Home Grown Healing Traditional Home Remedies from Mexico. Berkley Books, New York, NY, 1998. Yerba mansa is versatile, it can be taken orally as a tea, tincture, infusion or dried in capsule form. It can be used externally for soaking inflamed or infected areas. It can be ground and used as a dusting powder. Some people in Las Cruces, New Mexico use the leaves to make a poultice to relieve muscle swelling and inflammation.Moore, Michael.

The Java IFC was fairly close to the early versions of the Objective C NeXTStep classes for NeXT. A builder tool was also included under the IFC umbrella that was close in spirit (but significantly limited in functionality) to NeXT's Interface Builder. This ecosystem was attractive to NeXT application developers interested in looking at the Java language. History On April 2, 1997, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced their intention to combine IFC with other technologies to form the Java Foundation Classes. Ultimately, Sun merged the IFC with other technologies under the name \\"Swing\\", adding the capability for a pluggable look and feel of the widgets. Because its technology has been merged to constitute Swing and Java 2D, IFC is now no longer maintained. Differences from Swing Swing drew a lot of features from IFC: * contrary to AWT, IFC were written in pure Java, thus being (at the time) browser-independent. * IFC already provided two Layout managers, that would be later included in the standard JDK * some IFC components were able to read HTML content from URLs, but the implementation was still far from reliable. However, Swing also improved IFC in a lot of ways: * IFC did not have a Model-View architecture * contrary to Swing, the Look and feel of IFC components was written in the components themselves, making it impossible to change it easily. * IFC components were not JavaBeans. IFC had a specific persistence mechanism, but it was a bit complex, and not compatible with the Java Serialization API. * event mechanism was still raw, and the Event loop sometimes needed to be accessed directly. Examples =Hello World= This is the classic Hello world program in IFC: import netscape.application.*; import netscape.util.*; public class HelloWorld extends Application { public void init() { super.init(); // Create a text field TextField textField = new TextField(100, 24, 128, 24); // Set the string to be displayed in the text field. textField.setStringValue(\\"Hello World\\"); // Add the text field to the view hierarchy. mainRootView().addSubview(textField); } // This method allows HelloWorld to run as a stand alone application. public static void main(String args[]) { HelloWorld app = new HelloWorld (); ExternalWindow mainWindow = new ExternalWindow(); app.setMainRootView(mainWindow.rootView()); Size size = mainWindow.windowSizeForContentSize(320, 200); mainWindow.sizeTo(size.width, size.height); mainWindow.show(); app.run(); } } To be compared with the equivalent Java Swing code: import javax.swing.*; public class HelloWorld extends JFrame { public HelloWorld() { setDefaultCloseOperation(DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE); add(new JLabel(\\"Hello, World!\\")); } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloWorld app = new HelloWorld(); app.pack(); app.setVisible(true); } } References External links *IFC presentation *IFC runtime download *IFC programming guide *IFC class hierarchy *IFC tutorial The last places, where to download the IFC: *ftp-Server 1 Uni- Potsdam *ftp-Server 2 Uni-Potsdam *ftp-Server 3 Uni-Potsdam *ftp-Server Uni- Bochum *ftp-Server SunSite All find from *FileSearching.com The web-archive where is the last place to find really all files: *WebArchive of the IFC-side Additional you can still find IFC here: *Server of the MIT - Nathans account *Server of the MIT - stuff side Category:Java (programming language) Category:Java (programming language) libraries Category:Java APIs Category:Widget toolkits ","title":"Internet Foundation Classes"},{"id":"12247661","text":"A quantum field theory of general relativity provides operators that measure the geometry of space time.

The 12 aircraft, flown by English pilots, arrived at Juva Jukajärvi Airport on February 26. The machines were long-nosed, Mk.IVs. After a short period of training, the squadron took part in bombing missions from March 4, 1940, fighting the Russian invasion of the Vyborg Bay . By the start of the truce, the squadron had completed 62 aircraft-specific warfare flights. One aircraft had been lost, three of the crew had died and one had been taken as a prisoner of war. After the Winter War, the squadron moved from Jukajärvi to the Luonetjärvi base, where training continued throughout the truce. On April 25, 1940, seven aircraft and their crew transferred to Pori Airport for a month-long mission to fly surveillance flights in the Baltic Sea and the Åland Islands. The squadron aircraft also performed aerial photography during the truce: on October 13 and November 11, 1940, the Soviet base at Hanko and the Russian airports in the Karelian Isthmus were photographed. In the summer of 1941, at the beginning of the Continuation War, the squadron was transferred to Siikakangas Airport . The squadron flew its first military flight on June 28, performing reconnaissance and filming the sections Parikkala-Rautu and Vyborg-Sortavala with a single aircraft. These remained the only flights from the Siikakangas field. On July 3, the squadron was transferred back to Lake Luonetjärvi, with the task of supporting the field army, which was preparing to attack at the Karelian Isthmus. On July 4, the squadron bombarded Russian troops and tanks on the Tyry-Ihala road with nine aircraft, and railway equipment at Elisenvaara station on July 8, first with eight aircraft and later the same day with nine aircraft. The third flight was discontinued on November 18 due to a shortage of aircraft. At the end of the year, the squadron had only four working Blenheim aircraft in good condition. Major Olavi Lumiala was appointed squadron commander on 4 August 1942. The first bombing mission of 1943 was completed on February 19, when the squadron took part in the whole regiment's bombing of the weapons factories at Seke. The four aircraft from LeLv 42 all hit the target. The day after the Seke attack, the third flight of the squadron was re-established as the fleet improved. In addition to recriving repaired aircraft from the aircraft factory, the squadron received four Blenheim's from LeLv 44, who were transferring to Junkers Ju 88s. On 14 February 1944, the name of the squadron was changed, by adding a prefix, describing its operations, and was henceforth known as Bomber Squadron 42 (PLeLv 42). On the same day, Major Kalle Kepsu became the new commander of the squadron. The squadron participated in the Lapland war, as part of Flying Regiment 4, which was subordinate to the Sarko Flight Group. It conducted bombardment and reconnaissance missions against the retreating German troops, flying out from the Paltamo, Pudasjärvi and Kemi airports. On December 4, as the Air Force bengan transferring to its peace- time organization, the squadron was renamed the Bomber Squadron 41. The squadron flew only a few flights, and on January 20 it received orders to moved to its peacetime base at Luonetjärvi, which was accomplished by January 26. Two Blenheims were lost in the Lapland War, both shot down by German air defense. Following the lifting of the flight ban imposed by the Allied Control Commission in the fall of 1944, the squadron continued to operate from the Luonetjärvi base, training Blenheim crews up until August 1, 1945. The bombers were scrapped in accordance with the Paris Peace Agreement, which entered into force on 15 September 1947, and after a transitional period of one year, Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft were assigned to the squadron on 15 September 1948. The first 109s entered the squadron in October 1948. As the Messerschmitt fleet were at the end of their lives, the squadron was decommissioned on December 1, 1952, as part of the Air Force reorganization.

History Chalybeate is located in the northern part of Tippah County, just east of Walnut on Highway 354. The small town was first called Chalybeate Springs because of an iron- enriched spring located there. The word \\"chalybeate\\" is Latin and means full of iron. From the very beginning, the water from the springs was considered to be beneficial to health, and the community was considered a health resort at one time. Chalybeate's beginnings stemmed from the community of Jonesborough, which was founded prior to 1840. Jonesborough became extinct shortly after the Civil War, when the merchants in the town were unable to compete with newer and larger stores located a short distance away in Chalybeate. Chalybeate has always been known for the excellent education it provides for its residents and surrounding communities. The first school was founded in 1889, when J. Finch Ray recognized a need for a school in the area and set out to obtain excellent teachers. He and other town leaders developed a stock company and sold shares to finance the school. The school was named Chalybeate Springs Institute and operated under that name until 1900, when it became Chalybeate Springs High School. In 1957, Chalybeate school consolidated with Walnut and today it only serves ages kindergarten through the eighth grade. The town was a thriving community for years, and at one time had a boarding house for teachers of the school and for persons wanting to drink the spring water. It was operated by Mr. and Mrs. D. B. Bobo and later by Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Bobo. A mercantile firm of McBride and Wiggs (January 1899 – 1928) built up a big business. Later, another firm, Clemmer and son, had a good business also. Later another mercantile firm was owned and operated by R. L. Clemmer and W. A. Bobo. J. F. Ray had a saddle and harness shop at the place where Chalybeate Baptist Church is now located, and he had a tan yard back of what is now the school gymnasium. Henry Luftenberg operated the harness and saddle shop and Alexandria McKenzie the tan yard. For many years, the village operated a sawmill when lumber was plentiful: and a cotton gin did a thriving business for years. Chalybeate Bank operated for a number of years under the presidency of W. E. Clemmer. It was forced to close down during the depression. Early physicians in Jonesborough and Chalybeate were Dr. A. W. Whitten, Dr. A. J. Whitner, Dr. Hughey Giles, Dr. G. W. Scalley, Dr. E. J. Green and Dr. J. W. McIntyre. Many of the early settlers came from the Carolinas and were the Whittens, Rays, Powells, Hollis, Garretts, Bobos, Hortons, Wilbanks, Gibbs, Richardsons, and Clemmers. Today, although the school and churches still thrive in Chalybeate, the town itself is a grouping of empty buildings, some of which just recently burned. A gas station and small store are all that remain in operation in the business district. Several old two-story homes and a beautiful church remain near the town center. The community is served by ZIP Code 38683 and Area Code 662, Exchange 223. Geology The area's Tertiary Clayton formation consists of limestone and marl. The limestone is marked by Turritella fossils, and named for them, with yellow sandy marl on top of it. At Chalybeate Spring, this marl is exposed. Education The community has a school, Chalybeate Elementary, which is part of the North Tippah School District and serves students in grades kindergarten through eight.

An Act of Parliament was required in 1843 to acquire the land from Southampton Common. It covers an area of and the total number of burials is estimated at 116,800. Currently there are 6 to 8 burials a year to existing family plots. History On 9 November 1841, Southampton Town Council resolved \\"that the Town Clerk be directed to give notice of an application to parliament at the next session for establishing a cemetery or burial ground on part of Southampton Common\\". The town council approached John Claudius Loudon. He was a well known landscaper, designer of arboretums and cemeteries including Histon Road Cemetery at Cambridge and Bath Abbey Cemetery. Loudon, normally based in London, had been staying on the Isle of Wight whilst his wife was writing a book. The damp sea air had a debilitating effect on his health and he moved to take temporary lodgings in Southampton. Southampton Town council had no previous experience of laying out a cemetery and was pleased that Loudon was conveniently available. They paid him £37 for his services, but decided not to use his proposed layout. The Bishop of Winchester was not willing to concede that the proposed Anglican chapel would adjoin a nonconformist chapel. =Competition= As was customary in the planning of early cemeteries, the council held a competition and asked for suggested layouts to replace the one made by Loudon. The design of William Rogers a local nurseryman and councillor was accepted and he was awarded the contract. =Opening= The cemetery was opened on 7 May 1846 when the Bishop of Winchester consecrated part of the grounds. A section was left unconsecrated for the \\"Dissenters\\" (non-conformists) and agnostics while another part was provided for the Hebrew community. In 1856, the Roman Catholics were given ground within the cemetery for their use. The Southampton Cemetery Act 1843 allowed for up to to be taken from the common but it was initially laid out as a site with the remaining being added in 1863. In 1884 a further act of parliament was obtained to transfer another to the cemetery. Famous incumbents Rosas memorial in Southampton Old Cemetery.

He won the Speedway World Championship three times, in 1971, 1975, and 1978. He also won the World Long Track Championship in 1973. In 1979 Olsen won Speedway World Pairs Championship with Hans Nielsen. In 1978, 1981 and 1983 Olsen was the captain of Denmark's winning Speedway World Team Cup teams, while also finishing second in 1979 and 1982. Denmark could only place third in the 1980 World Team Cup Intercontinental Final and missed a place in the Final held at the Olympic Stadium in Wrocław, Poland, the same track where he made his World Individual Final debut in 1970. In 2015, Olsen was named an FIM Legend for his motorcycling achievements. Olsen's success greatly helped popularize the sport in Denmark which led to him building and opening a track at Vojens, the 15,000 capacity Vojens Speedway Center, which has held many Danish Championships as well as the 1988 and 1994 Speedway World Finals (1994 being the last under the old single meeting format) while it hosted the Speedway Grand Prix of Denmark from 1995 until 2002, after which the Danish GP was moved to the larger capacity Parken Stadium in Copenhagen. Career summary Olsen was born in Haderslev, Denmark. He was taught to ride a speedway bike in 1966 by his friend and great rival of the 1970s, New Zealand's Ivan Mauger. He first rode in the UK for the Newcastle Diamonds in the British League from 1967 until 1969 (Mauger was also with Newcastle at the time). He then moved to the Wolverhampton Wolves, where he remained from 1970 until then end of the 1975 season, having avoided a move to Oxford Rebels.Bamford,R & Shailes,G (2007). “The Story of Oxford Speedway”. Ironically, the Rebels would beat Wolves both home and away to take the Midland CupLawson,K (2018) “Rebels 1975 – The Last Season”. In 1976 he joined the Coventry Bees where he enjoyed the most success, winning two British League titles as well as the 1981 League Cup. Olsen has also won the British League Riders' Championship in 1972, 1976, 1977 and 1978. Olsen was close to winning two further World Championship titles. In the 1972 final at London's famous Wembley Stadium, whilst in second place of his first heat he fell and failed to score. Despite winning his other four heats, he was beaten by Mauger and Sweden's Bernt Persson. Ole won his second World Championship in 1975 with a 15-point maximum at Wembley. The very next night he won the Danish Championship in Vojens. Unbelievably though, Olsen failed to qualify for the 1976 World Final in Poland when he could only manage 12th in the Intercontinental Final at Wembley. He only scored 6 points in the IC Final after being excluded from his first race, suffering engine failure in the very next race, and only managing three second places in his next three rides. In 1977 at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg where he had won his first championship in 1971, Australian rider John Boulger fell on a rain soaked track whilst Olsen was leading. In the re-run of the heat, Olsen was beaten by the eventual winner Mauger again, though he had to defeat England's Michael Lee in a run-off to finish third in the championship (reigning World Champion Peter Collins finished second behind Mauger). Ole Olsen won his final Individual World Championship in 1978 at Wembley scoring 13 points from his five rides. He finished one point clear of Englishman Gordon Kennett, and two points in front of third placed Scott Autrey from the United States. He was involved in a run-off for third place in 1979 at the Silesian Stadium in Katowice, Poland. Olsen finished last in the run-off won by Michael Lee from American Kelly Moran and Australian champion Billy Sanders. His last place saw him finally classified 6th in his title defence. 1979 was the last of a record 6 World Championships won by Ivan Mauger. Olsen was only a reserve rider for the 1980 World Final at the Ullevi Stadium (won by Michael Lee) and did not get to ride on the night. He won his place as a reserve by beating American Scott Autrey in a run-off for 11th place at the InterContinental Final at White City in London after both riders finished on 6 points. He qualified for what many thought would be his last World Final in 1981 at Wembley, and ended up finishing second behind American Bruce Penhall (the first American World Champion since Jack Milne in 1937). Olsen had the distinction of winning the last ever Speedway World Final race held at the original Wembley Stadium. In a run-off for second place he beat fellow Dane and Coventry team mate Tommy Knudsen.Bamford, R. & Shailes, G. (2002). A History of the World Speedway Championship. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. After qualifying for 11 straight World Finals between 1970 and 1981 (he was a reserve in 1980), Olsen missed the 1982 World Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, his run ending when he scored only 4 points and finished 15th in the InterContinental Final at Vetlanda in Sweden. Olsen qualified for what would be his last Final in 1983 at the Motodrom Halbemond in Norden, West Germany. One of four Danes in the final along with Erik Gundersen, Hans Nielsen and reserve rider Peter Ravn, Olsen finished in 6th place with 10 points. Gundersen finished 4th, also on 10 points, while Nielsen's chance of finishing second or third ended when he suffered an engine failure whilst leading in his final heat. Had Nielsen won or finished second in his final heat (won by West Germany's Egon Müller who won his only World Championship by being undefeated on the day), he would have forced a run-off with either second placed Aussie Billy Sanders or third placed Michael Lee. Ole Olsen won the Danish Championship each year from 1967-1973, and won the Nordic Championship in 1971, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1978. He also won the InterContinental Final in 1978 and was the British- Nordic-American Champion in 1974. In 1976 he won the Australian Championship at the Liverpool Speedway in Sydney despite protests from other riders who did not believe he should have been allowed to ride as he was not Australian (however, the promoters saw his drawing power and included him in the field). Olsen defeated Australian legends Phil Crump and home town hero Billy Sanders to take the title. In Australia he also won the NSW State Championship in 1972, and in the same year finished second in the Australian Championship behind Jim Airey at the Rowley Park Speedway in Adelaide. At the height of his success and popularity, Ole was the biggest sports star in Denmark. Retirement Ole Olsen has remained involved in the speedway since his retirement in 1983. He co-owned the Vojens Speedway Center since its opening in 1975. The speedway hosted the 1988 and 1994 World Finals, with the 1994 final being the last to be run in the traditional single meeting format before the advent of the Speedway Grand Prix (SGP) series in 1995. From 1995 until 2002, the Speedway Center hosted the Speedway Grand Prix of Denmark before it was moved to the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen. The Speedway has hosted the Speedway Grand Prix of Nordic since 2009. The Speedway Center also hosted Round.2 of the three round 1986 Speedway World Team Cup Final, as well as the WTC Final in 1991 and 1998. It also hosted the Speedway World Cup Final (the WTC was renamed in 2001) in 2003, 2008 and 2010 and will again host the Final in 2015. It also holds the distinction of hosting the last ever World Pairs Championship Final in 1993. Vojens also hosted the inaugural European Under-21 World Championship in 1977. This championship was renamed as the World Under-21 Championship from 1988. As of the 2014 Speedway Grand Prix, Olsen is the FIM Speedway Grand Prix race director. He also serves as the SGP Track Inspector and overseas track preparation for the series.

It is active in Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. In Brussels it is known as the Rassemblement Bruxelles France or RBF. Its aim is the secession of Wallonia, Brussels and the six Flemish municipalities with language facilities for French-speakers around Brussels from Belgium and to unite them with France. The party's symbol is the red rooster, representing Wallonia, inside a hexagon, which is a common geometric representation of France. The blue, white, and red represent the colours of the French national flag. History France, Wallonia and Brussels united Defending the principles of republicanism, democracy, pluralism, and socialism, the party was founded on 27 November 1999 in Charleroi. It was established on the basis of a reconciliation between three organisations: Andre Libert's Rassemblement Wallon (RW); Paul-Henry Gendebien's Democratic Alliance Wallone (AWD), which was formed in 1985 when Gendebien left the Social Christian Party (PSC); and the Walloon Movement for the Return to France (RF), chaired by Maurice Lebeau. In the 2003 federal elections, the party was presented under the label \\"RWF-RBF\\". It was presented again under the label \\"RWF\\" in the 2007 federal elections, and received 1.5% of votes in the Senate against 1.2% in the Chamber of Representatives in Wallonia. The RWF is present in every election in Wallonia and Brussels. In the 2009 regional elections, the party won 1.37% of the vote for the Walloon Parliament. In the 2009 European elections, it won 0.43% of the vote in the French-speaking electoral college. The RWF was refounded in 2010 on the proposal of President Paul-Henry Gendebien and the Executive Board. In March 2012, the Constitutional Convention elected Laurent Brogniet as the new President of the RWF, and Paul-Henry Gendebien became founding president. New statutes were subject to the approval of Congress.

Vogelzang worked as a director for the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) and is part of the board of directors of the KNVB as well. He was Chef de Mission of the Dutch Olympic Committee during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. At Feyenoord Vogelzang was appointed in April 2007 for a period of five months. He is the central person for all directors and board members which have a goal to restructure the club after Jorien van den Herik was forced to resign. With the appointment of Vogelzang commercial director Chris Woerts and Director Finance and Operations Onno Jacobs can focus on more specific subjects in their jobs. Under his regime Feyenoord started two \\"talent pools\\" of which several talented players of the club, including Royston Drenthe, Jonathan de Guzman, Luigi Bruins, Ron Vlaar, Andwélé Slory and Georginio Wijnaldum are part. Fans of the club with a lot of money, mostly directors of companies are able to invest 250,000 euros each in the talent pool, eventually they will be awarded a total of 25% of the profit that is made out of selling the players in the talent pools. The pools were successful from the beginning and the first one was sold out within a few weeks, which resulted in the start of the second pool which also turned out to be a success. Unless financial trouble and a disappointing season for Feyenoord in which they were excluded for the UEFA Cup, only finished 9th in the Eredivisie and missed out on European football for the next season Feyenoord was able to do some surprise signings. Players like Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Tim de Cler, Kevin Hofland and Roy Makaay (all (former) Dutch internationals) were purchased with money that was made available out of the talent pools. Vogelzang will stay at the club until October 2007.

Description Given a holomorphic endomorphism f:S\\\\to S on a Riemann surface S we consider the dynamical system generated by the iterates of f denoted by f^n=f\\\\circ\\\\stackrel{\\\\left(n\\\\right)}{\\\\cdots}\\\\circ f. We then call the orbit \\\\mathcal{O}^+(z_0) of z_0 as the set of forward iterates of z_0. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the orbits in S (which will usually be \\\\mathbb{C}, the complex plane or \\\\mathbb{\\\\hat C}=\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, the Riemann sphere), and we call S the phase plane or dynamical plane. One possible asymptotic behavior for a point z_0 is to be a fixed point, or in general a periodic point. In this last case f^p(z_0)=z_0 where p is the period and p=1 means z_0 is a fixed point. We can then define the multiplier of the orbit as \\\\rho=(f^p)'(z_0) and this enables us to classify periodic orbits as attracting if \\\\rho<1 superattracting if \\\\rho=0), repelling if \\\\rho>1 and indifferent if \\\\rho=1. Indifferent periodic orbits can be either rationally indifferent or irrationally indifferent, depending on whether \\\\rho^n=1 for some n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} or \\\\rho^n eq1 for all n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}, respectively. Siegel discs are one of the possible cases of connected components in the Fatou set (the complementary set of the Julia set), according to Classification of Fatou components, and can occur around irrationally indifferent periodic points. The Fatou set is, roughly, the set of points where the iterates behave similarly to their neighbours (they form a normal family). Siegel discs correspond to points where the dynamics of f is analytically conjugate to an irrational rotation of the complex disc. Name The disk is named in honor of Carl Ludwig Siegel.

Siegel's theorem proves the existence of Siegel discs for irrational numbers satisfying a strong irrationality condition (a Diophantine condition), thus solving an open problem since Fatou conjectured his theorem on the Classification of Fatou components.Lennart Carleson and Theodore W. Gamelin, Complex Dynamics, Springer 1993 Later Alexander D. Brjuno improved this condition on the irrationality, enlarging it to the Brjuno numbers.

It is about 3 km south of Pattaya and is home to high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, beaches, and restaurants. The town Jomtien has experienced a construction boom in the past several years, with many new condominiums and housing developments built in the area. Jomtien has become very popular with Bangkok residents seeking a second home, as well as with foreign retirees. Jomtien Complex is an important real estate development located a block from the beach, and includes a large group of shophouses, restaurants, bars and stores. A recent trend has been the opening of many upscale restaurants along Thappraya Road, the main thoroughfare connecting Pattaya and Jomtien. In addition, Second Road (running parallel to Beach Road about 400 meters inland), was completed in the last few years and now features many new developments. Jomtien Market, located adjacent to another complex of about 60+ open-air bars, is now another focal point for beach-goers. A large number of Russian and Scandinavian nationals visit or live in the area. In particular there are 2 large Norwegian colonies, called Nordic and New Nordic on the Pratumnak Hill. Attractions Jomtien Beach is known for its water sports, including jet skis, para-sailing, scuba diving, and for several annual sponsored sports events, such as a Jet Ski World Cup event, and festivals, attracting visitors from around the world.  Transportation  ;Road #Via the Bangkok-Chonburi-Pattaya Motorway (Highway 7) The motorway is linked with Bangkok's Outer Ring Road, (Highway 9) and there is also another entrance at Si Nakharin and Rama IX Junction. #Via Bang Na-Trat Highway (Highway 34) From Bang Na, Bang Phli, across the Bang Pakong River to Chonburi there is a Chonburi's bypass that meets Sukhumvit Road., (Highway 3, passing Bang Saen Beach, Bang Phra to Pattaya. ;City roads * Jomtien Beach Road: this street runs parallel to the beach * Jomtien Second Road (Thappraya Rd extension): this four-lane road runs parallel to Beach Road and connects to Thappraya Road to the north and Soi Wat Boon to the south. * Thappraya Road: commences at the northern end of Jomtien Beach Road and at the junction of Jomtien Second Road turns left (north) and forms the main access road to Pattaya. * Thepprasit Road: this street connects Thappraya Road to Sukhumvit Road. * Soi Wat Boon: This street connects south Jomtien Beach Road to Sukhumvit Road. * Soi Chayapruek: This street connects south Jomtien Beach Road to Sukhumvit Road. ;Bus Pattaya is served by frequent bus services from Bangkok's Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit) and the Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekamai). Buses from Pattaya serve nearby provincial towns and direct long distance routes serve many provincial capitals. City and suburban services are mainly provided by blue songthaews. They are available at the Pattaya Nuea bus terminal to take passengers to Jomtien Beach. There is now a regular bus service from the bus depot on Thappraya Road (just north of Theprasit Rd intersection) to Suvarnabhumi Airport. ;Taxis There are some metered taxis and air-conditioned vans operating for private hire from some hotel car-parks. Songthaews (aka \\"bahtbus\\") are the most popular mode of public transportation, and run from Jomtien Beach to north Pattaya. On the regular route the cost is 10 baht for shorter distances and most Pattaya destinations or 20 baht for north Pattaya and beyond. However they can be much higher if asked to go to a designated destination. Motorbike taxis generally operate in the town and suburbs, and are mainly used by locals for short distances. ;Air Jomtien Beach is about 1-1/2 hours, or 120 km by road from Suvarnabhumi Airport, the Bangkok international hub.
