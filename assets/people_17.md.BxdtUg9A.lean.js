The building served as the corporate headquarters for AmSouth Bancorporation from 1972 until 2006, and Sonat, Inc. and its subsidiaries from 1972 until 2007 when it relocated to the Colonial Brookwood Center. The building now serves as the corporate headquarters for Regions Financial Corporation. History Completed in 1972, the modernist-style skyscraper was designed by Welton Becket & Associates of Houston with Charles H. McCauley Associates serving as the local associated firm. Built as a partnership between First National Bank and Southern Natural Gas Corporation, its original name was the First National-Southern Natural Building. The reflective glass skin stretches between a generously scaled black granite base story and a louvered steel penthouse enclosure. The building is set back from the corner with a raised terrace plaza. A one-story banking lobby facing 20th Street closes off the north side of a sunken courtyard which serves the basement-level cafeteria. During the early 1980s First National changed its name to AmSouth Bancorporation as well as Southern Natural Gas changing its name to Sonat, Inc., and the building was then given its most familiar name the AmSouth-Sonat Tower. In 1986, Sonat announced that it would sell its 50 percent interest in the building to AmSouth and lease back its half of the building, but decided to retain its interest instead. In 1999, Sonat merged with Houston based El Paso Corporation. El Paso maintained a large presence in the building with its Southern Natural Gas division using it as its headquarters. El Paso also had energy trading offices located in the building after it merged Sonat's Marketing and Power Marketing divisions to its own energy trading business. In 2001, Sonat finally sold its 50 percent interest in the building to AmSouth. As a result the building's name changed again in 2002, being renamed the AmSouth Center. In November 2006, after the merger of AmSouth and Regions, the name of the building officially changed to the Regions Center with the new Regions logo replacing the AmSouth logo. On January 29, 2007, Southern Natural announced that it would move its headquarters to the Colonial Brookwood Center, located in one of Birmingham's suburbs. After renovating Sonat's former offices, Regions became the sole occupant of the building. =Lighting= During the Christmas season 2,200 colored gels are illuminated in each panel of the glass curtain wall, creating an enormous lit graphical display visible on the skyline from well outside the city. The east side is a Christmas tree, the south a wreath, the west a candy cane, and the north a stocking. Since 2007, the building has been illuminated every May for the Regions Tradition and the Regions Charity Classic before that. All four sides of the building are illuminated to depict a golfer teeing off.

Its mascot is the Foothiller, so chosen because, at the time of the school's construction, east county was much more isolated from the rest of San Diego than it is today and was often referred to as the boondocks or the foothills. Grossmont is in the Grossmont Union High School District. The school has an approximate enrollment of 2,800 students. Grossmont High School has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 1962. The current accreditation is valid through 2020. Grossmont High School was recognized as being a California Distinguished School for the scholastic year of 2008–2009.  Campus  The school's “Old Main” building was constructed in 1922 and was used for decades as a teaching space before being converted to district offices. The campus has slowly expanded over the past 80+ years to include thirteen additional permanent instructional, athletic, and administrative buildings. Notable among these is the “Old Gym” which was built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Recent plans to demolish this gymnasium were tabled after considerable negative community response. Grossmont is listed as being in El Cajon but is actually right on the border of La Mesa and El Cajon. It is located close to regional Harry Griffen Park. The majority of the student body is from the La Mesa area. Prop H Construction on the Grossmont High School campus began summer of 2005. The corridors are in the process of being re-modeled. So far the 800, 700, and 500 buildings have been re-modeled and the construction crews are going in reverse order by the building number, 800 first and 100 last. 600 will not be re- modeled as it was re-modeled in 1995, along with the Old Gym. The 400 building or the Old Main building was shut down. Whether the district will re-model this building or demolish it is yet to be decided. Proposition U passed during the 2008 election by an overwhelming majority. Construction and renovation on the campus will continue. =Future construction= The Grossmont Union High School District plans to first renovate the newer buildings, and have rebuilt the science and Locker Room Buildings. The Science Building Project encompasses designing a two-story science classroom building on the site of the current boy's locker room, shower facilities and weight room. The design is approximately 17,033 GSF for the Science Building comprising ten (10) classrooms (3 Chemistry; 5 Biology; 2 Physics) and New Restrooms. The building is designed to the current District Standards as to performance capabilities, and per Education Code and building codes (ADA compliance, Fire Life Safety, Structural). They will then separately, construct a new 9,250 GSF Boys Locker, Showers, Weight Room. The underground utility infrastructure (wet & dry) utilities will removed, rerouted, installed (as required or requested) consistent with the underground utilities water infrastructure plan. Construct a new 9,250 GSF Boys & Girls Locker, Showers, Team Room, which replaced the existing Carl Perkins Building, demolished to make way for the new science building.  Extracurricular activities  =Athletics= Grossmont's athletic teams, the Foothillers, compete in the Hills League of the Grossmont Conference and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) San Diego Section. The school fields teams in the following sports: baseball, boys basketball, cheer, girls basketball, boys cross country, girls cross country, football, boys golf, girls golf, gymnastics, boys lacrosse, girls lacrosse, boys soccer, girls soccer, softball, boys swimming & diving, girls swimming & diving, boys tennis, girls tennis, boys track & field, girls track & field, boys volleyball, girls volleyball, boys water polo, girls water polo, and wrestling. Grossmont's varsity baseball team have captured the division II CIF title in the past 4 seasons ('05, '06, '07, '08) and ranks amongst the most competitive high schools in California. Grossmont High School's rival is Helix High School. Helix High School and Grossmont High School play for the coveted \\"musket\\" trophy in football.  Traditions  =Commencement= Commencement at Grossmont used to take place atop nearby Mt. Helix in an amphitheater constructed in the early part of the 20th century for Easter sunrise services. Graduation ceremonies were later moved to San Diego State University, and then to Grossmont's own Thomas Mullen Adams Stadium (Adams was the first American military officer killed during the Iraq war, and a 1993 graduate). Awards granted each year at commencement include the Circle G Award, the Boy and Girl of the Year Award, and the Norman Freeman Award. Notable alumni * Doug Benson, 1981, comedian * Gregory R.

Description In Hindu Vigyan, Rahu Kaal is one of the 8 segments of the day and considered inauspicious period in Indian astrology due to its association with malefic, Rahu. The segments are calculated by taking the total time between sunrise and sunset, at a given place, and then dividing this time duration by 8. Astronomically in the Hindu Panchang Panchangas, the ever varying planetary configurations mean that the auspicious hours during each day will not always fall at the same moment of time. Rahu kaal (Raahukaala), Gulikakaala, Yamagandakaala (Yama Ghantam) and Vishaghati are the time periods which are especially considered inauspicious or unlucky (Ashubh). The planets according to Indian astronomers are the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu. Even though Rahu and Ketu are not physical bodies, they are sensitive points called lunar nodes on the intersection of the ecliptic (the apparent path of motion of the Sun) by the Moon's orbit. Rahu is the northern node and Ketu is the southern node. Ancient astronomers felt that the mighty Rahu and Ketu have the strength to obscure the sun, thus causing a solar eclipse. Hence it is considered inauspicious to begin any undertaking during this \\"Rahukaal\\". Every day this Rahukaal lasts for around 90 minutes, but the duration differs according to the length of the time between sunrise to sunset. To calculate Rahukaal, the time between the sunrise and sunset is divided into 8 units or time-groups, which time-group will have the Rahukaal depends on the weekday. Several websites offer calculation for a given place and time. For each weekday, Rahukaal falls as under: * Sunday - 8th Muhurta (Unit) * Monday - 2nd Muhurt * Tuesday - 7th Muhurt * Wednesday - 5th Muhurt * Thursday - 6th Muhurt * Friday - 4th Muhurt * Saturday - 3rd Muhurt Rahukaal mnemonics The timespan of Rahukaal varies each day and needs to be calculated as per the sunrise and sunset time. The times below can be used in absence of access to accurate Rahukaal. These times are accurate only if the daylight lasts for 12 hours, and the sunrise is at 6.00 AM. For longer or shorter days, the times need to be adjusted. =In English= In English, the mnemonic phrase is \\"Mother Saw Father Wearing The Turban Suddenly\\" * Mother = Monday (7.30-9.00) * Saw = Saturday (9.00-10.30) * Father = Friday (10.30-12.00) * Wearing = Wednesday (12.00-13.30) * The = Thursday (13.30-15.00) * Turban = Tuesday (15.00-16.30) * Suddenly = Sunday (16.30-18.00) =In Tamil= One of the mnemonics in Tamil is \\"திருநாள் சந்தடியில் வெய்யிலில் புரண்டு விளையாட செல்வது ஞாயமா? \\" * திருநாள் - திங்கட்கிழமை - Monday - 0730 hrs to 0900 hrs * சந்தடியில் - சனிக்கிழமை - Saturday - 0900 hrs to 1030 hrs * வெய்யிலில் - வெள்ளிக்கிழமை - Friday - 1030 hrs to 1200 hrs * புரண்டு - புதன்கிழமை - Wednesday - 1200 hrs to 1330 hrs * விளையாட - வியாழக்கிழமை - Thursday - 1330 hrs to 1500 hrs * செல்வது - செவ்வாய்க்கிழமை - Tuesday - 1500 hrs to 1630 hrs * ஞாயமா - ஞாயிற்றுக்கிழமை - Sunday - 1630 hrs to 1800 hrs In Malayalam In Malayalam, The mnemonic phrase is \\"\\"തിന്നടാ ശങ്കരാ വെണ്ണ ബുദ്ധിക്കും വ്യാധിക്കും ചൊല്ലുന്നു ഞാൻ\\" * തിന്നടാ = തിങ്കൾ = Monday (7.30-9.00) * ശങ്കരാ = ശനി = Saturday (9.00-10.30) * വെണ്ണ = വെള്ളി = Friday (10.30-12.00) * ബുദ്ധിക്കും = ബുധൻ = Wednesday (12.00-13.30) * വ്യാധിക്കും = വ്യാഴം = Thursday (13.30-15.00) * ചൊല്ലുന്നു = ചൊവ്വ = Tuesday (15.00-16.30) * ഞാൻ = ഞായർ = Sunday (16.30-18.00) = Here is another method to find the \\"Rahukalam\\" in a day =  \\"Eleven Boys Have A Good Football Court/Club\\"  Here Eleven Stands for Monday, Boys For Tuesday, Have for Wednesday, A for Thursday, Good for Friday, Football for Saturday and Court/Club for Sunday. _Rahukalam-Monday_ Consider Eleven. \\"E\\" in the word eleven is the 5th letter in the alphabet 5+(Half of 5)= 7.5 Since \\"Eleven stands for Monday, \\"Rahukalam\\" on Monday is from 7.30 AM to 9.00 AM (\\"Rahukalam\\" duration is 1.30 Hrs.) _Rahukalam-Tuesday_ Boys = \\"B\\" is the 2nd letter in the alphabet 2+(Half of 2) = 3.0 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Tuesday is from 3.00 PM to 4.30 PM _Rahukalam-Wednesday_ Have = \\"H\\" is the 8th letter in the alphabet 8+(Half of 8) = 12.0 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Wednesday is from 12.00 PM to 1.30 PM _Rahukalam-Thursday_ A = \\"A\\" is the 1st letter in the alphabet. 1+(Half of 1) = 1.5 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Thursday is from 1.30 PM to 3.00 PM _Rahukalam-Friday_ Good = \\"G\\" is the 7th letter in the alphabet. 7+(Half of 7) = 10.5 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Friday is from 10.30 AM to 12.00 PM _Rahukalam-Saturday_ Football = \\"F\\" is the 6th letter in the alphabet. 6+(Half of 6) = 9.0 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Saturday is from 9.00 AM to 10.30 AM _Rahukalam-Sunday_ Court/Club = \\"C\\" is the 3rd letter in the alphabet. 3+(Half of 3) = 4.5 \\"Rahukalam\\" on Sunday is from 4.30 PM to 6.00 PM See also * Muhurta * Jyotiṣa References External links * RahuKaal.com * https://www.vedicinsights.com/rahu-kalam Category:Hindu astronomy ","title":"Rahukaalam"},{"id":"5056171","text":"Nepenthes × hookeriana (; after Joseph Dalton Hooker), or Hooker's Pitcher- Plant,Phillipps, A. & A.

Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad. Currently, he is professor emeritus of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York. Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the \\"Father of Viagra\\".AEI Speaker's Bureau He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor- in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry. Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,Antibe Therapeutics a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and is past member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company. Personal life Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8. Ignarro is married to anesthesiologist Dr. Sharon Ignarro and lives in Beverly Hills, CA. He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons. Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics. Academic career Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer. Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor. In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP. Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) previously identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time, and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF. During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach. Herbalife relationship and controversial scientific results Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body's own production of nitric oxide. Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months. Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million. Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health. Experimental results in some of his non-peer-reviewed scientific publications have been described as fabricated. Famous quotes While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: \\"Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine\\".

A man with two watches is never sure.\\" The mood of the saying is ironic. While at a surface level it appears to be advocating the simplicity and self- consistency obtained by relying on information from only a single source, the underlying message is to gently question and make fun of such apparent certainty – a man with one watch can't really be sure he knows the right time, he merely has no way to identify error or uncertainty. Nevertheless, the saying is also used in its purely surface sense, to caution against the potential pitfalls of having too much potentially conflicting information when making a decision. History Supposedly, the saying was coined by the San Diego Union on September 20, 1930: \\"Confusion.—Retail jewelers assert that every man should carry two watches. But a man with one watch knows what time it is, and a man with two watches could never be sure.\\" Later this was — mistakenly — attributed to Lee Segall of KIXL, then to be misquoted again in Arthur Bloch's book as \\"Segal's Law\\". https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/a_man_with_one_watch_knows_what_time_it_is_a_man_with_two_is_never_sure In reality In reality a man possessing one watch has no idea whether it is the correct time unless he is able to compare it to a known Time standard.Alan J. Scott, Addicted to Placebos: Understanding Science and Society, pp. 41-44, Alan Scott, 2006 . This situation is not made any worse by having two watches, because the probability of all combinations of states of these watches needs to be taken into account in order to know the right time. Two watches may, depending on the size of the errors of each watch, let you determine which is closer to the correct time based on estimated solar time (or other non- standard but trustworthy time sources). Let there be two states: W (working—showing the correct time), and B (broken—showing the incorrect time). The set of possible states of the two watches are then: : S = \\\\text {(WW, WB, BW, BB)} If the probability of a watch being in the W state is p and in the B state is q, and assuming both watches have the same probability of working, then the total probability of all possible states is : p^2 + pq + qp + q^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 since it is certain the watches are in one of these states. The first term, p2 represents both watches in the working state so this state will unconditionally yield the correct time. The second term 2pq represents one watch working and the other not. Since it is impossible to know which one is correct one can only guess. Half the time the guess will be right and half wrong so the effective probability of having the right time from this state is only pq. The last term represents both watches not working which will never yield the correct time. The total probability, P, of having the correct time is thus : P = p^2 + pq and since q = 1 − p : P = p^2 + p(1-p) = p that is, the same probability as one watch. An improved probability of obtaining the correct time is only possible with at least three watches since majority voting logic can then be applied.Tegze P. Haraszti, CMOS Memory Circuits, pp. 36-438, Springer, 2000 . The case of three watches has a total probability of : p^3 + 3p^2q + 3pq^2 + q^3 = 1 The second term will always yield the correct time by majority voting. The third term represents two malfunctioning watches. It is possible to tell that there is a problem but not which watch is correct. Thus again, the best solution is a simple guess that will only be right one third of the time. Thus, the total probability of having the correct time is : \\\\begin{align} P & = p^3 + 3p^2q + pq^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = p + p^2 (1-p) \\\\end{align} which is clearly greater than p. Likewise, the probability function of n watches can be found from the binomial expansion of (p + q)n. This reasoning is not valid if there are systematic errors present in the watches. For instance, if all the watches start to gain at high temperature in the same way this is an error that cannot be either corrected or even detected by majority voting.

He was the last barrister in either Ireland or England to hold the rank of serjeant-at-law, hence his nickname The Last Serjeant. Early life A younger son of A M Sullivan and Frances Donovan, he was born in Dublin and educated at Ushaw College, Belvedere College, Trinity College Dublin and King's Inns. Sullivan was called to the Irish Bar in 1892 and practised on the Munster Circuit. Barrister He was appointed an Irish KC in 1908 and King's Third Serjeant-at-law (Ireland) in 1912 advancing to Second Serjeant in 1913 and First Serjeant in 1919 – the last holder of that position. A moderate constitutional nationalist and supporter of the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sullivan was a prominent campaigner for the recruitment of Irishmen into the British army during the First World War. His opposition to Sinn Féin republicanism and his prominent role in conducting prosecutions on behalf of the Crown during the Irish War of Independence led to an attempt on his life in 1920. In April 1921 Derry House, Rosscarbery, in County Cork, which Sullivan had purchased two years previously was burned by the IRA. As a result, Sullivan relocated to England in 1921 and established a career at the English Bar, having previously been called to the Middle Temple in 1899. He subsequently became a Bencher and Treasurer of Middle Temple. By courtesy, he was always referred to as Serjeant Sullivan, even though that rank no longer existed in England. He remained a member of the Irish Bar, and returned at least once to appear in the celebrated case of Croker v Croker, where the children of the former leader of Tammany Hall, \\"Boss\\" Croker attempted to overturn his will, which left his entire estate to their stepmother. He was noted as a fearless advocate, who brought to his English practice the robust manners he had learned in the Irish county courts. He did not hesitate to interrupt the judge, and if he felt that he was not receiving a fair hearing, he was quite capable of walking out of Court.Notably in Hobbs v. Tinling [1929] 2 K.B. 1, following a quarrel with Lord Chief Justice Hewart. Casement trial In 1916 Sullivan was retained as lead counsel in the trial of Sir Roger Casement for treason. No English barrister would defend Casement, and Sullivan was persuaded to take the case by George Gavan Duffy, whose wife Margaret was Sullivan's sister. Despite his rank of Serjeant at law and King's Counsel at the Irish bar, Sullivan was at that time only ranked as a junior barrister in England. As the facts relied on by the prosecution were largely undisputed, Sullivan was limited to arguing a technical defence that the Treason Act 1351 only applied to acts committed \\"within the realm\\" and not outside it. The Act's terms had however been expanded by case law over the previous 560 years, and the defence was rejected by the trial judges and by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Casement commented “God deliver from such antiquaries as these, to hang a man’s life upon a comma and throttle him with a semi-colon.”https://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2011/11/roger- casement-the-gay-irish-humanitarian-who-was-hanged-on-a-comma Memoirs Sullivan wrote two books: Old Ireland in 1927 and The Last Serjeant in 1952. He retired from legal practice in 1949, and returned to Ireland to spend his last years there.

In January 1058, as a partisan of the newly elected Pope Nicholas II, Leo had the gates of the Leonine City thrown open for Godfrey, former duke of Lower Lorraine, and his wife, Beatrice, marchioness of Tuscany. Godfrey immediately possessed the Tiber Island and attacked the Lateran, forcing Benedict X to flee on 24 January. Leo allied himself with the reformers, including Hildebrand and Pope Alexander II, but he was unable to dispel, through negotiations, the attack of 14 April 1062 which gave Rome to Antipope Honorius II. His son was Pier Leoni and through him he is the father of the great Pierleoni family which dominated Roman politics for much of the Middle Ages. So far as one can tell, he lived in peace with the Roman people and the pontiff, but his grandson, who was elevated to the papacy as Antipope Anacletus II, was lambasted for his Hebrew ancestry; as was another grandson, Jordan, who was elected patrician of the Commune of Rome and became also an enemy of the legitimate popes.

Throughout the history of Texas, English and Spanish have at one time or another been the primary dominant language used by government officials, with German recognized as a minority language from Statehood until the first world war. Official language status Texas currently does not have an official language; though historically at various points in time there have been laws giving both official status and recognition to English, Spanish, German and Norwegian. In 1834 with Degree No. 270 of Coahuila y Tejas gave both English and Spanish official status in Texas. In 1836 the Provisional Government of Texas establishing the Judiciary of Texas provided that Court of Records may be in English. 1837 the Congress of the Republic of Texas passed a joint resolution directing the Secretary of State provide an official Spanish translation of general laws, and the act of congress incorporating the City of San Antonio provided that public schools be erected that taught in English, later in 1841 the Spanish Language law was suspended for one year until being reenacted in 1842 In 1846, the newly admitted State of Texas enacted legislation required that the laws of Texas be translated into German in addition to Spanish In 1856, an act was passed allowed for legal proceedings in Justice of the Peace courts in counties west of the Guadalupe River (excluding Nueces, Refugio and San Patricio) to be conducted solely in Spanish if the Judge and all parties spoke Spanish. In 1858, an act was passed requiring public schools teach primarily in English.; In the same year the law requiring the translation of Texas criminal law was briefly extended to Norwegian for two years. 1893 State law was passed requiring all public schools to teach exclusively in English. In 1925 it was made a criminal offense to give instruction in Spanish in Public schools, this law was amended in 1927 to allow Spanish instruction in Elementary schools located in counties bordering Mexico with at least one city of 5,000 population. Nevertheless, English (specifically, American English) is the language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties, education, federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements; Spanish is also heavily spoken in Texas due to the large number of Tejanos, Mexicans and other local and foreign Spanish-speakers. The Government of Texas has been required since 1837 by joint resolution of the Congress of the Republic of Texas to provide Spanish translation of laws through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates that state agencies provide information on their website in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English,\\"Sec. 2054.001.\\" Texas Legislature.

Texas German and Texas Silesian are varieties of German and Silesian (closely related to Polish) that are indigenous to Texas. Today the dominant language in Texas, as in most areas of the United States, is English. Texan English Contrary to popular belief, there is no exclusive Texan dialect of American English. However, some linguists contest that there is a unique subset of Southern English spoken in Texas. According to the Phonological Atlas of the University of Pennsylvania virtually all native Texans speak Southern American English, while other studies claim that Texas is home to several dialects of American English. All of East Texas and usually most of central and north Texas are classified as speaking the Southern dialect, which is the same dialect being spoken in north Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, and northern Alabama. Usually it is portions of far West Texas and lower South Texas that are classified as speaking a Western or Southwestern dialect. According to the University of Tampere atlas, the same Southwestern dialect is spoken in South and West Texas and southern California, extreme southern Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. The Gulf Southern dialect is spoken in most of Central, East, and North Texas with the Texas Panhandle speaking the Midland South dialect, which is shared by those who live in Kansas, Missouri, and Southern Nebraska. Other languages Recent immigrants from other US regions and foreign countries are causing a linguistic shift in Texas. Spanish speakers have risen to almost a third of the population; Vietnamese and Chinese languageline.com Languages Spoken in Texas (PDF) have replaced German and French to become the third and fourth most spoken languages in Texas, respectively; with Hindi, Korean, Kurdish especially from Abtaf, from the Asad Beig tribe , and Tagalog filling out the top nine most spoken languages in Texas. Large numbers of non-native Texas residents are picking up some dialectal traits of Southern English, while other linguistic traits are being subdued into a national homogenizing trend. There were also several smaller language groups, including Czechs (several thousands Moravians) and Polish. Texas German is a dialect of the German language that is spoken by descendants of German immigrants who settled in the Texas Hill Country region in the mid-19th century. =Spanish in Texas= The Spanish dialects spoken by some Tejanos are becoming more influenced by Mexican dialects of Spanish due to a large influx of recent immigrants from Mexico. In some locations of lower South Texas and far West Texas these Spanish Creoles and the dialects of English spoken by Anglos and non-bilingual Tejanos are being supplanted as the dominant language by Mexican Spanish.

He was occasionally credited as Fergie Frederiksen or just Fergie. He contributed to hit singles in three consecutive years, all with different bands: Survivor's \\"American Heartbeat\\" in 1982, LeRoux's \\"Carrie's Gone\\" in 1983 and Toto's \\"Stranger in Town\\" in 1984. Early life and career Frederiksen started his musical career at the age of 13, and he played clubs and pubs at the age of 15 with a group called the Common People in Grand Rapids, MI. In 1975, while he was still attending college at Central Michigan, Frederiksen was asked by his friend Tommy Shaw to replace him as the lead vocalist for the band MSFunk, as Shaw was leaving to join Styx.Fergie Frederiksen biography , La Roux website. Retrieved October 2, 2011. Frederiksen was with MSFunk for a year before disbanding in 1976. While living in Chicago, he helped form a local progressive rock band called Trillion with keyboardist Patrick Leonard. Trillion's debut album was released in 1978 and was produced by Gary Lyons (producer of Foreigner's debut album); all but one of its nine tracks were co- written by Frederiksen. The band went on to tour with Styx and Heart, where Frederiksen began performing his trademark back-flips during live shows to fire up crowds, a gimmick he would continue with later bands. Frederiksen would leave the group after one album, and was replaced by Thom Griffin. After leaving Trillion, Frederiksen started focusing mainly on session work; primarily movie soundtracks. In 1979, he signed with Casablanca Records, where he performed under the alias of David London. (Frederiksen wanted to separate his rock image from the disco image Casablanca was known for.) He sang two tracks (\\"Samantha\\" and \\"Sound Of The City\\") on the soundtrack to Can't Stop The Music (which reached number 47 on the Billboard 200), as well as a more AOR-style solo album in 1981, with his friend Mark Christian as the lead guitarist. This would turn out to be one of the last albums released by Casablanca Records, as the fall of disco in the early 1980s forced the label to fold, eventually becoming part of Polygram Records. He would drop the stage name soon after, officially going by his childhood nickname \\"Fergie\\", which stemmed from his grade school classmates once incorrectly thinking his last name was \\"Ferguson\\". While at Casablanca, he met Gregg Giuffria, of the recently defunct glam-rock band Angel (one of the few rock acts signed by the record label). The two started working in his studio in late 1981 in hopes of a possible new Angel LP under a new line-up. It was in these Angel recordings where Frederiksen met bassist Ricky Phillips. The two became long-time friends and have collaborated on many projects. This line-up never completed an official album, as Giuffria started focusing heavily on the formation of his group Giuffria in 1982, but did record three songs during band sessions: \\"Whips\\", \\"Troubleshooter\\", and \\"Should Have Known Better\\". These tracks were later released on the Angel Rarities collection, and were eventually covered by White Sister. After Kansas singer Steve Walsh originally left the band, auditions were held in early 1982. Frederiksen was one of several candidates who tried out, but John Elefante eventually took over the lead vocal spot.Louisiana Music Hall of Fame \\"INDUCTEES-VIDEOS LeRoux #47 interviews Fergie-Jim-Leon-Rod 1982 \\", Retrieved on April 25, 2010. However, Kansas manager Budd Carr spotted Fergie during auditions and began working with him soon after, which ultimately would prove instrumental for Frederiksen's career. It was around this time that long-time friends Jim Peterik and Frankie Sullivan from Survivor invited Frederiksen to their studio during the recording of their third album, while lead singer Dave Bickler was experiencing vocal cord strain. Ultimately, Bickler was able to finish the album, and Frederiksen assisted with background vocals. The band's third album Eye of the Tiger was released in May 1982, with Frederiksen credited simply as \\"Fergie\\".Louisiana Music Hall of Fame \\"INDUCTEES-VIDEOS LeRoux #48 LIVE performance and interview Fergie-Jim-Leon-Rod\\", Retrieved on May 3, 2010.

In late summer of 1982, Frederiksen and Asia session- guitarist Jim Odom were both recruited by manager Budd Carr, to replace lead singer/guitarist Jeff Pollard of LeRoux, who had recently left the band to start his own Christian ministry. Fergie became LeRoux's new front-man soon after. So Fired Up, the band's fifth album, was released in February 1983. It included the hit song \\"Carrie's Gone\\", which Frederiksen wrote shortly after breaking up with then girlfriend Carrie Hamilton (Carol Burnett's daughter). The band was dropped from RCA Records, but are still together and touring, and were recently inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, Frederiksen reunited with Ricky Phillips to start a brand new band called Abandon Shame, featuring Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain, and his wife Tane. The quartet worked on 5 songs in 1984, with Fergie only singing on one of the tracks. The Kevin Elson-produced \\"You Can't Do That\\", \\"Burnin' in the Third Degree\\", and \\"Photoplay\\" appeared in the soundtrack to The Terminator, and were credited to Tahnee Cain and Trianglz.

He has repeatedly cited his brief tenure with Toto as the highlight of his career.Romano, Allessio (2009). Fergie Frederiksen Interview, The Official Toto Italian Website. Later life and career Following his expulsion from Toto, Frederiksen took to touring as \\"Toto\\", using a setlist which included many Toto songs that predated his time with the band. This angered the real Toto, who had already taken out a restraining order against Frederiksen's predecessor, Bobby Kimball, to stop him from doing the same thing. (Toto and Frederiksen were reconciled in 2007, at which point he joined them on stage for a few guest spots on their tour.) After 12 years in the music industry, Frederiksen unofficially retired and started focusing on the restaurant business with his father. He returned to music in the mid-1990s to reunite and collaborate with Ricky Phillips. Their Frederiksen/Phillips album was released in 1995, and featured Giuffria's David Glen Eisley on background vocals.

The game uses QuickTime VR-styled panoramas in a first-person camera mode. The game takes place starting in 1903. Gameplay The player takes the role of Professor Samuel Hunt, a cultural historian at the British museum, and explores a 3D pre-rendered environment using a 360° field of view and moving between the various locations and interacting with objects and characters by clicking. In AGON, the cursor will change to indicate what actions players can take, ranging from arrows for movement to a cogwheel for using an object. The player has access to an on- screen dial which can open an inventory and access items; and open files allowing the player to view various documents located in the game. At the end of each episode, except episode 1, the player must face a computer-controlled character in a board game, and win in order to complete that episode. There is a slight discrepancy of the controls between the episodes; for example in Episode 4 the Files section records conversations, whilst documents are stored within the inventory. Plot * Episode 1 - London Scene In 1903, Professor Samuel Hunt receives a mysterious letter and the first page of a Codex. The page makes references to a demonic 'Black King' and to several board games. The letter mentions the Black King is linked to an artifact in the museum. Hunt informs his close friend, Dr Thomas Smythe, about the artifact, and with Smythe's help, locates the artifact in the stores. Hidden in the artifact is a stone with coordinates and a name written on it, pinpointing a location in Lapland and a family named Vainio. Hunt decides to travel to the twelve locations mentioned in the codex, and find the games, leaving Smythe behind to find out what he can about the Codex. * Episode 2 - Adventures in Lapland Arriving in Lapland, Professor Hunt has to find the last descendant of the Vainio family and the board game owned by the family. The story is told in the format of 'Acts', beginning with the player attempting to find a way to the nearby village. Secondly, he must gain the trust of the villagers to find Vainio's whereabouts. Thirdly, he has to find his way across the icy wastes beyond the river to Vainio's hut. The final act involves playing Vainio at the game of Tablut and winning. * Episode 3 - Pirates of Madagascar The stone Vainio gave to Hunt takes him to Madagascar, searching for a certain Rakotonorivelo, who owns the next board game. However, Rakotonorivelo is the chief of the nearby village, and his treasure has been stolen by an English pirate, who is still on the island. Hunt has to find the pirate, and from him learn the location of the chief's hidden treasure, which is the chief's board game, Fanorona. * Episode 4 - The Lost Sword of Toledo Whilst travelling to Toledo, Spain, Hunt receives a letter from Smythe informing him that the codex pages he has recovered in the previous episodes are fakes. He can do little but continue to Toledo, where he discovers the owner of the board game he is searching for, a young man known for his honesty, has been imprisoned on charges of theft of an ornamental sword. Hunt attempted to prove his innocence, and recover the lost sword to play Francisco Candelas at Alquerque. * Episode 5 - The Tale of the Four Dragons Episode 5 has not yet been released, but will be set in Peking, China. Games The episodes are available separately on download, and in anthology form on disc. *The Mysterious Codex - Includes episodes 1–3. *The Lost Sword of Toledo - Includes episode 4.

He is credited with reinventing the ancient form of epic writing in modern prose. He is also regarded as a trend-setter in the sense that he pioneered the creation of literary works based on the Puranas.Learning lessons from mythology, The Hindu. http://www.hindu.com/lf/2004/12/05/stories/2004120500640200.htm Because of the large impact of his body of work on Hindi literature, this era of contemporary modern Hindi literature, since about 1975, is sometimes referred to as the Kohli Era. Life Narendra Kohli was born to Parmananda Kohli and Vidyavanti, a Punjabi Hindu couple in Punjab province of British India.डॉ. कृष्णकुमार ,लेखक करता है परकाया प्रवेश , Madhumati:Rajasthan Sahitya Acadami, (2006).http://www.lakesparadise.com/madhumati/show_artical.php?id=648 His first school was the Dev Samaj High School in Lahore. Then he attended the Ganda Singh High School in Sialkot for a few months. In 1947, after the partition of India, the family moved to Jamshedpur (Bihar). He resumed his schooling in third grade at Dhatkidih Lower Primary school. He spent fourth to seventh grade (1949–53) at New Middle English school. Urdu was the medium of instruction for all subjects except English, which was limited to reading and writing. From eighth to eleventh grade, he attended KMPM High School in Jamshedpur. He selected the science stream in high school. The medium of instruction was Urdu till this point.Brief Introduction, www.narendrakohli.org. http://www.narendrakohli.org/person.html For higher education, he joined the Jamshedpur Co-operative College. He took the IA exams in 1959 from Bihar University with Compulsory English, Compulsory Hindi, Psychology, Logic, and special Hindi as his subjects. He completed his BA (Hons.) in 1961 from Jamshedpur Co-operative College (Ranchi University) in Hindi. He completed his MA in 1963 at Ramjas College (University of Delhi), and in 1970, received his PhD from the University of Delhi. Early writings Kohli at his writing table, New Delhi (2008) His first story was in sixth grade for the handwritten class magazine. In eighth grade, his Urdu story Hindostan: Jannat Nishan was published in the school's printed magazine. As a child author, some of his first Hindi stories were published by Kishore (Patna) and Avaaz (Dhanbad). During his IA years, Sarita (Delhi) published his story Paani ka Jug, Gilas aur Ketli in its Nae Ankur (\\"New Sprouts\\") column. After February 1960 his works started getting published regularly. He considers Do Haath published by Kahani (Allahabad) as his first published work. He wrote a few novels based on the life of families and societies as well. But just portraying the society, or ridiculing its flaws and dilemmas was not going to satisfy him. He realised, that literature cannot reach its ultimate goal just by a narrow, partial and limited display of society, nor can the society benefit from such literature. The demonstration of poor human qualities will only encourage the evil and the foul. Therefore, it must be the goal of literature to demonstrate the great, honourable and moral aspect of life, he believes.

Its stated mission is to \\"empower small-dollar donors\\". Activities Co-founder Benjamin Rahn at a fundraiser in 2006 ActBlue does not endorse individual candidates. The organization is open to Democratic campaigns, candidates, committees, and progressive 501(c)4 organizations. Groups that use ActBlue pay a 3.95% credit card processing fee. As a nonprofit, ActBlue runs its own, separate fundraising program and accepts tips on contributions to pay for its expenses. ActBlue was founded in 2004 by Benjamin Rahn and Matt DeBergalis. In February 2016, ActBlue launched AB Charities, an arm of the organization that makes ActBlue's fundraising tools available to nonprofits. Both the 2016 and 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden used ActBlue during their primary and general election campaigns. Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 primary campaigns also used ActBlue for fundraising. Federal Election Commission reporting ActBlue reports to the Federal Election Commission all contributors to Federal campaigns, regardless of the amount. When a candidate for a Federal election raises money through ActBlue, ActBlue serves as a conduit for election law purposes. All conduit contributions are itemized and reported. By contrast, there is a $200 threshold for reporting individuals who contribute directly to a candidate committee. Many small donors, whose names would ordinarily be shielded, are thus exposed to the public. Fundraising ActBlue raised $19 million in its first three years, from 2004 to 2007. In the 2005-2006 campaign, the site raised $17 million for 1500 Democratic candidates, with $15.5 million going to congressional campaigns. By August 2007, the site had raised $25.5 million. In the 2018 midterms elections, ActBlue raised $1.6 billion for Democratic candidates. According to FEC data, from January 2017 to October 2018 Beto O’Rourke had raised $45 million through ActBlue for his unsuccessful run against Ted Cruz, 48% of which came from outside Texas. In 2019, ActBlue raised roughly $1 billion for a wide variety of campaigns. The Daily Beast notes that between January and mid-July 2019, ActBlue brought in $420 million, and that \\"According to the organization, that total came from 3.3 million unique donors and was dispersed to almost 9,000 Democratic campaigns and organizations, with $246 million coming in the second quarter alone.\\" In 2020, several fundraising records were broken. In the week following the killing of George Floyd, on May 31st, over $19 million was raised, the highest single-day total so far that year. On June 1st, that yearly record was again broken with $20 million in donations. Over half of donations in the week following the killing went to charitable (non-political) causes, including one ActBlue page devoted to a bail fund which raised over $1.5 million dollars from over 20,000 donors. In the day following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, over $30 million was donated through ActBlue, again breaking the single-day fundraising record.

It is part of the Reynolds School District, and is the second-largest high school in Oregon. History The school takes its name from the school district, which was named for the Reynolds Aluminum plant in the city that closed in 2000. On May 29, 1979, a three-alarm fire injured three students and damaged the gym and theater. Reynolds High School merged with Columbia High School in 1989. Columbia High School is now the site of Reynolds High School, and the former Reynolds High School is now one of three middle schools in the district, Reynolds Middle School. =2014 shooting= On June 10, 2014, an active shooter situation occurred at the school during morning period. One student, 14-year-old freshman Emilio Hoffman, was killed. A physical education teacher suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The shooter, 15-year-old Jared Michael Padgett, who was using an AR-15 and also equipped with a handgun and a knife, engaged a responding officer in a gunfight before retreating inside a school bathroom, where he fatally shot himself. SWAT and FBI agents secured the school. The students were evacuated and were released to their parents at a nearby Fred Meyer store. The shooting occurred on the second-to-last day of the school year. During the evacuation, a second gun, which was unrelated to the shooting, was found at the scene and one person, who did not have a permit to carry a concealed firearm, was taken into custody. The individual confessed to bringing the gun to the school to protect his sister, a freshman at the school.\\"Affidavit: Man came to school with gun to 'protect' sister\\" Padgett had planned to pursue a career in the United States Armed Forces. He was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, and his oldest brother served in the military in Afghanistan. Padgett had managed to acquire his weapons from a secured area in the family home. This was the first fatal school shooting in Oregon since the 1998 Thurston High School shooting, which left two students and the shooter's parents dead and another 25 wounded. Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber attended a community vigil in Troutdale that evening; he called the shooting \\"a senseless act of violence\\". President Barack Obama, speaking at a Tumblr-sponsored question-and-answer session the day of the shooting, declared, \\"We're the only developed country on earth where this happens.\\" Obama further stated that only a massive shift in public opinion could sway Congress to act in favor of greater gun control measures. In 2015, a bond resolution was proposed, which would grant the district $125,000,000 to help replace, and renovate several schools in the district, and install security upgrades in every school in the district. A portion of this sum of money was used to remodel the northern portion of the main establishment. This specifically includes remodeled science, functional life- skills, culinary, and early childhood education classrooms, cafeteria area, and kitchen. Relocation of the main office and counseling office by the new and more secure main entry. And all buildings that make up the campus internally connected. Construction was started spring of 2017, and is projected to be complete fall of 2018. Academics In 2008, 64% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 611 students, 388 graduated, 130 dropped out, 39 received a modified diploma, and 54 were still in high school the following year. In 2009, there were nearly 900 freshmen in the incoming class, a record for the school. This was combined with a 25% layoff of teachers, over 40 teachers at the school.

From 2002 to 2006, the building and parking lot was used as a used car dealership. The building was largely demolished in January 2007. However, the restaurant was reconstructed in 2009 and has re-opened as part of the Bob's Big Boy chain, while retaining the original look and design of Johnie's. Due to the building's 1950s style, the restaurant has been featured in several movies and TV shows. History =Early history= Johnie's Broiler, now operating as Bob's Big Boy Broiler, has a Googie-style coffee shop and drive-in restaurant. It was founded and initially named after owner Harvey Ortner who was previously a partner in the Clock Broiler restaurants of Alhambra, Lynwood, Bellflower, Culver City, Van Nuys, South Pasadena and Temple City. Ortner and his wife Minnie purchased former poultry farm property located on Firestone Boulevard and Old River School Road in 1950. The couple hired architect Paul B. Clayton to design the Harvey's Broiler which was completed in 1958. Clayton's design incorporates Southern California Googie architectural elements intended to attract customers from motorists traveling in either direction on Firestone Boulevard. While writing about the Southern California culture, writer Tom Wolfe wrote in the early 1960s that \\"They cruise around in their cars in Harvey’s huge parking lot, boys and girls, showing each other the latest in fashions, in cars, hairdos (male and female) and clothes in the Los Angeles Teenage... and Second-Generation Teenage... modes, Teenage Paris! Harvey’s Drive-in!\\". Harvey's was featured in the nationally distributed magazine Sports Illustrated. In its 1961 issue, the author wrote \\"A favorite in the Los Angeles area is Harvey's Broiler, a drive-in in the suburb of Downey. Here high school hot rodders gather to partake of the glorified \\"chubby,\\" a double hamburger, gape at one another's cars and check on the latest fads. On weekend nights hundreds of cars jam the parking lot, and eager drivers waiting for a berth circle the block. Occasionally an impatient driver races his engine twice in rapid succession, sending a throaty whoom-whoom into the soft night air. Instantly other drivers respond in automatic litany. In the old days this ritual, called \\"rapping the engine,\\" was a challenge to a street race.\\" Harvey's Broiler was an overnight success and thousands of people came from all over the United States to experience the phenomenon of \\"The Broiler\\". The restaurant was renamed Johnie's Broiler in 1968 and additional signage was installed in 1969 after the sale of the restaurant to an interim owner by the name of Johnson (hence the reason for the single \\"n\\" in \\"Johnie's\\"). Apparently this interim owner couldn't meet the terms of the agreement and the sign had already been changed from Harvey's to Johnie's. Drive-In curb service ceased in 1970. Ortner executed a lease-to-own agreement with Christos Smyrniotis in 1970. The future owner had been employed as an assistant chef at the Broiler. Johnie's Broiler was a Harvey Ortner Enterprise listed on his business card as late as 1983 and according to an interview done by Burly Burlile in June of that year. The \\"Fat Boy\\" mascot, modeled after Beanie from the cartoon show Beany and Cecil (not the Bob's Big Boy character), animated incandescent yellow bulbs on the roof edges and the \\"OPEN 24 HOURS\\" lettering, were added in 1969 and Downey's Broiler became a sister store to Johnie's Coffee Shop Wilshire (originally a Simon's Drive-In site and currently employing its former 1955 Romeo's Times Square construction an Armet & Davis design Alternate link via official Los Angeles Times website.). This location appears to have been owned by the Johnsons who could not satisfy their agreement for the Downey location with the Ortners. =Cruisers= During the Broiler's heyday, hot rods and \\"Kustom Kars\\" would cruise a route of popular carhop drive-in restaurants. One of the cruise circuits began in Long Beach at Grisinger's (now George's) drive-in, continuing on to Holly's in Hawthorne on to the Wich Stand on Slauson and Overhill, and ending in Downey at the Broiler. As many as 3,000 young people took part in the ritual on some nights. In 1986, Lee McCullough requested and received funding and started up Harvey's Cruise Nite based on the success of an earlier cruise originated by Street Rodder magazine contributing editor and Harvey's alumni Burlie Burlile, in tribute to the Broiler's heyday of late 1950s and 1960s cruising. DJ Randy Roubal played oldies and hundreds of hot rods and vintage cars from the 1930s to the early 1970s attended the cruise nite on Wednesday evenings. The McCullough Cruise Nite continued until a July 1990 dispute with the property owner. Cruisers returned in 1991 and car clubs like the Auto Butchers and Sultans continued the tradition until 1994, when enthusiasm waned. Much filming was done at the site and in October 1999, Harvey's-Johnie's was lit up once again. Rods & Customs lined its parking lot and craft services cooked up \\"Fat Boys\\" in the vein of \\"Chubby the Champ\\" the Broiler's original double- deck hamburger. Johnie's was featured on the December 1993 cover of Rod & Custom magazine. =Preservation attempts= On New Year's Eve 2001, Johnie's Broiler ended operation and early in 2002 new tenants gutted part of the interior and converted the restaurant and parking area into a used car dealership. Alternate Link via NewsBank. A local grassroots campaign to preserve the drive-in's exterior ensued, led by Adriene Biondo, John Eng and Alan Leib of the Los Angeles Conservancy's Modern Committee, and Analisa Ridenour-Hungerford of the Friends of Johnie's advocacy group. In early 2002, the State of California's Historic Resources Commission unanimously voted to add Johnie's Broiler to the State's Register of Historical Places. Approval of the property's owner was also required for inclusion in the registry but Smyrniotis objected on economic grounds. Nonetheless, the Broiler's \\"eligible\\" status offered the same protections as if it were actually listed. In August 2006, Smyrniotis signed a 99-year lease with a new tenant, Ardas Yanik. Although the City of Downey rejected a demolition permit in November of that year, Yanik began to remove the structure the following year. =Illegal demolition= Johnie's Broiler after its demolition on Sunday, January 7, 2007. On Sunday, January 7, 2007, authorities halted demolition of Johnie's Broiler after a large amount of destruction had already been done. Initial reports indicate that no demolition permits had been issued for the property. Bulldozers began their work around 3 p.m. Judging by early photographs, it appeared that much of the main structure had been heavily damaged, leaving the large main sign, front facade and car canopy structures still remaining upright. The lease-holder, Ardas Yanik, reportedly \\"pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor charges stemming from the demolition and had his lease forfeited.\\" In an article in the Los Angeles Times, reporter Valerie Reitman credited Helen Burns, who had been part of the 2002 drive to designate the restaurant as a state historic landmark, with noticing the demolition around 5 p.m. on January 7. The original kitchen and the back of the coffee shop had been demolished by the time Burns arrived. She phoned the police and then began phoning other preservationists and car buffs, urging them to notify the police as well. Police arrived on the scene within a half-hour and stopped the illegal demolition, according to Reitman. \\"People could have been injured or killed; the electrical was live,\\" noted Downey City Councilman Mario Guerra. By that time, much of the structure had been demolished but Friends of Johnie's joined with fans, neighbors, classic car clubs, cruisers and preservationists to rally for Johnie's and coordinated the sale of T-shirts with events, cruises and kept attention focused on the demolished building. Following its illegal demolition on January 7, 2007, preservationists and other supporters regrouped. These included the Mod-Com (Adriene Biondo, Chairperson), Friends of Johnie's (Analisa Ridenour, President) and the Coalition to Save and Rebuild Harvey's Broiler (Kevin Preciado, Leader). =Reconstruction as Bob's Big Boy= After the demolition was halted on January 7, 2007, the city council of Downey supported the efforts of citizens to preserve and restore the building. In April 2008, Jim Louder, owner of the Bob's Big Boy restaurant in Torrance, California, entered into a long-term lease agreement with Smyrniotis, the land owner. The restaurant was rebuilt with the help of Downey's Redevelopment Agency and the Downey Historical Society. Construction was completed and the restaurant opened as Bob's Big Boy Broiler in October 2009. The restaurant was rebuilt as a Bob's Big Boy Broiler which incorporated the surviving architectural elements of the old structure into the new restaurant that is based upon original blueprints. Since opening under the new name, the restaurant has continued to host car shows and be used in TV and Films. Movies and television Bob's Big Boy Broiler has been featured in several popular movies and TV shows because of its authentic 1950s look. Some of the films and TV shows that it was featured in are: * Bob Dylan's music video \\"Things Have Changed\\" (2000) was filmed at Johnie's Broiler. * One Hour Photo, a 2002 motion picture directed by Mark Romanek, used Johnie's as the coffee shop where the Robin Williams' character has his meals. The illuminated outdoor neon sign is seen at the beginning of the first coffee shop scene. * The Beach Boys An American Family, a 2000 ABC-TV movie, used Johnie's as an authentic location depicting life in 1960s Los Angeles, complete with vintage hot rods and roadsters. * The X-Files Johnie's posed as a bus station for a 1999 episode * Falcon Crest's 1988 episode \\"Rescue Me\\" * License to Drive (1988), as \\"Archie's Atomic Drive-In\\" * What's Love Got to Do with It (1993), as the coffee shop where the fight scene occurred between Ike & Tina Turner * Can't Hardly Wait (1998), with a crane shot showing an aerial view of Johnie's and the Fat Boy * Jawbreaker (1999) * Unstrung Heroes (1995) * Midnight Madness (1980) * Reality Bites (1994) * Short Cuts * Sean Kingston's music video \\"Beautiful Girls\\" * Jon B's music video \\"They don't know\\" * Madonna's music video \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" * Goodie Mob's music video \\"What It Ain't (Ghetto Enuff)\\" featuring R&B; trio TLC * The Country Bears * My Stepmother Is An Alien * Riot (1997) * Matchstick Men * Heat (1995) * The Game (1997) * Mission: Impossible 2 * Bounce, in the scene where Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck exit the restaurant * Rock group Staind's music video \\"For You\\" was partially filmed at Johnie's Broiler.

From here, CR 867 is a four-lane divided highway as it travels east from the coast through Mangrove-rich mudflats of San Carlos Bay to Truckland. After the intersection with CR 869 (Summerlin Road) in Truckland, CR 867 continues northeast to the community of Iona. In Iona, it intersects with State/County Road 865 (San Carlos Boulevard/Gladiolus Drive), which is where the CR 867 designation ends. =State Road 867= State Road 867 signage begins where CR 867 left off at the SR 865/CR 865 intersection in Iona. It continues in a northeast trajectory to just west of Cypress Lake where it turns to a north–south trajectory. Just north of Cypress Lake is the intersection the southern terminus of County Road 867A, which crosses the Caloosahatchee River into Cape Coral on the Cape Coral Bridge. The route continues in the opposite direction as College Parkway. SR 867 continues north and passes through the communities of McGregor and Whiskey Creek before entering Fort Myers' city limits. Once in Fort Myers, it terminates at County Road 884 (Colonial Boulevard), Lee County's main east–west thoroughfare. SR 867 once continued north past CR 884 along McGregor Boulevard, but in the mid 2000s, this segment was relinquished to the city of Fort Myers. McGregor Boulevard continues north as a city street, passing the Fort Myers Country Club and the Edison and Ford Winter Estates as it enters downtown Fort Myers, before terminating at US 41 (Cleveland Avenue) at the historic Five Points intersection (the former terminus of SR 867, which is also the terminus of State Roads 80 and 82, making a five-way intersection). History Tootie McGregor Terry Memorial Fountain currently located at Fort Myers Country Club. It formerly stood at the Five Points intersection before the overpass was constructed McGregor Boulevard, originally known as Riverside Avenue, was used historically by cattlemen to run cattle from Fort Myers to Punta Rassa, which was a significant cattle shipping town at the time. McGregor Boulevard is named after former Standard Oil executive Ambrose McGregor who, along with his wife Tootie, lived next door to Thomas Edison's estate in Fort Myers. After McGregor's death in 1900, Tootie and her second husband Dr. Marshall Orlando Terry (another local figure who donated land for Terry Park Ballfield) sought to have the road paved. They offered financial assistance to the county on the condition that it would be named McGregor Boulevard. Tootie McGregor died before the paving began, and Dr. Terry saw the paving to completion. McGregor Boulevard was officially completed in 1915. In honor of Tootie, Dr. Terry had a fountain installed at the north end of McGregor Boulevard at Cleveland Avenue. The fountain was removed in the early 1960s to accommodate the construction of the Caloosahatchee Bridge and overpass over the intersection. The fountain was then relocated to Fort Myers Country Club, where it stands today. In 1923, McGregor Boulevard was designated part of State Road 25, which extended from Punta Rassa to Palm Beach. It was redesignated as State Road 867 during the 1945 Florida state Road renumbering, with the portion east of US 41 to Palm Beach becoming State Road 80. Major intersections County Road 867A County Road 867A is the primary north-south arterial road for Cape Coral, Florida. Formerly State Road 867A, it essentially parallels SR 867 on the opposite side of the Caloosahatchee River. State Road 867A became a major route when the Cape Coral Bridge opened in 1964. The southern terminus of what was State Road 867A is at an interchange with McGregor Boulevard (SR 867) in McGregor. From the southern terminus, it travels west and crosses the Caloosahatchee River via the Cape Coral Bridge into Cape Coral, Florida. At the west side of the Cape Coral Bridge, SR 867A ran along Cape Coral Parkway for only until an intersection with Del Prado Boulevard. From here, it turned north and followed Del Prado Boulevard northward to its terminus at SR 78 (Pine Island Road) Since being turned over to the county in the early 1980s, Del Prado Boulevard has been extended north beyond Pine Island Road into North Fort Myers. North of Pine Island Road, addresses on Del Prado Boulevard have the attached \\"North\\" suffix to the name of the road; south of Pine Island Road uses \\"South.\\" From Pine Island Road, Del Prado Boulevard continues as a city street, though the city of Cape Coral maintains the CR 867A designation. It intersects Diplomat Parkway and the Kismet Parkway, before intersecting with US 41 (Tamiami Trail) at the northern Cape Coral city limits. The extension into North Fort Myers was built in the 1990s. From US 41, Del Prado Boulevard continues east as a rural county road along the northern edge of North Fort Myers. Just past the Prairie Pines Preserve, it briefly becomes Mellow Drive before it terminates at Slater Road. Future plans call for Del Prado Boulevard to be extended north from Mellow Drive in North Fort Myers around the Prairie Pines Preserve to Interstate 75 with a new interchange near the Lee-Charlotte County border.

It is operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego. It was founded in 1957 as the University High School (UHS or Uni), later the University of San Diego High School (USDHS), which was located in the Linda Vista neighborhood of San Diego. Construction began on CCHS at its current location on Del Mar Heights Road in Carmel Valley in 1999. In 2005 USDHS, including all faculty, administration, and students, moved to that campus and changed its name to Cathedral Catholic. Cathedral Catholic High School is accredited by the Western Catholic Education Association (WCEA), the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and holds membership with the College Board. History =University of San Diego High School= University High School (known as UHS or Uni) was founded in 1957 as a Catholic college preparatory high school for boys. It was located in the San Diego neighborhood of Linda Vista, on a site overlooking Mission Bay to the west and Mission Valley to the south, across the street from the University of San Diego which had been founded in 1949. The first principal was Reverend Father James Cadden, a scholar of church history. For the first few years of the school's existence the faculty consisted entirely of ordained priests. Its sister-school Cathedral Girls High School had been founded in 1943 and was located on a downtown campus. In 1970 it merged with UHS to become a co-educational high school. The class of 1971 was the first co-educational graduating class in UHS history. In 1986 the name of the school was changed to University of San Diego High School (USDHS). As of 2005 over 10,000 students had graduated from the school. Students at Uni were also afforded opportunities to participate in a wide variety of extracurricular activities including fine arts, athletics, clubs, service organizations and leadership roles. The athletic teams were the Dons, and all students and alumni were referred to as Dons, with the motto \\"once a Don, always a Don\\". In 1998 USDHS was honored by the United States Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. The Linda Vista campus held 1,450 students. In 1999, the Diocese of San Diego proposed a plan to relocate the school to a larger campus. Construction was begun on a brand new campus in a location in Carmel Valley. The new school was to have larger facilities to accommodate up to 2000 students, and host many extracurricular activities and sports such as football, swim/dive, water polo, basketball, sailing, soccer, field hockey, lacrosse, softball and baseball. The majority of these activities had been holding practices and events outside of the Linda Vista campus due to the lack of facilities. Dr. Richard Kelly was the principal from 1991 to 2004, the longest-serving principal of that school. He did not transition to CCHS but facilitated the move. =Transition= The new campus was completed in summer of 2005, and USDHS officially shut down after the 2004–2005 school year. The new school opened as Cathedral Catholic High School in August 2005, with all the same faculty, administration, and the remaining three classes of students from USDHS (Classes of 2006, 2007, and 2008). On May 31, 2008, the final class of USDHS students, who had been freshmen at the time of the transition, graduated from CCHS. Cathedral Catholic continued all of the traditions from USDHS, including the Dons mascot for the athletic teams. The names of the yearbook (Presidio), newspaper (El Cid), and art/literary magazine (El Sol) were also preserved. The Dons Athletic Hall of Fame was moved to the gymnasium at CCHS. The statues and relics from the old campus, such as the Mary statue from the quad, were all moved to locations around the Cathedral Catholic campus. The dedicated walk of fame from the quad at Uni was originally proposed to be moved and installed on the quad of CCHS around a new memorial fountain. But due to deterioration and costly efforts, the stones were not brought to CCHS. Those who had names there were honored with a memorial display, which was hung in the USDHS Library at CCHS during the 50th Anniversary Celebration. Notable dedications for major Uni/CCHS contributors have been engraved into the stone benches and lamp posts around CCHS' quad as well. The Linda Vista campus was temporarily occupied by Notre Dame Academy from June 2005 to January 2006, while that school's new campus, also in the Carmel Valley area, was being completed. In 2008 the Linda Vista campus was sold to The Irvine Company for development. The site is now the home of a 500+ unit apartment complex called Carmel Pacific Ridge. =Cathedral Catholic High School= The CCHS campus in Carmel Valley opened in 2005. It is designed to resemble a Tuscan village. The founding principal was Mike Deely, himself a graduate of USDHS; he served as principal until 2015.

It designed and constructed interurban cars, streetcars (trams) and (in smaller scale) buses. It was founded in 1902 in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1928, it bought the Versare Car Company. The company was among the first to make lightweight cars. Its chief engineer Thomas Elliot designed the curved-side car, a lightweight model that used curved steel plates (not conventional flat steel plates) in body construction. Instead of the floor, the side plates and side sills bore the bulk of the weight load. Longitudinal floor supports were no longer needed, which made the cars lighter than conventional cars. The first cars of this type were sold in 1922. For instance, the Red Devil weighted only .J.L.Koffmann 1980: Der Rollenstromabnehmer in Amerika. Der Stadtverkehr 4/1980, s. 182-184.

She was featured as Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month in May 1973. After her Playmate appearance, Dziubinska became an actress of film and television, perhaps most prominently in her debut role as a lesbian vampire in the British exploitation film classic Vampyres (1974), in which she was credited by only her first name, Anulka. Further acting assignments followed. In the late 1970s, Dziubinska moved to the USA. She continued her career and married twice. She left the public eye in 1985, however, when she became pregnant with her first child. Eventually, she became a floral designer and owner of a florist shop in Hollywood. She returned to Britain in 2003 for an appearance in the documentary short Return of the Vampyres, in which she shares her memories of working on the film. In 2006, she co-wrote a book about flower design, Zen Flowers: Designs to Soothe the Senses and Nourish the Soul. Early life and modelling She was born in Preston, Lancashire, England, the daughter of George DziubinskiNote. Polish surnames have masculine and feminine forms. If a masculine surname ends with \\"-i\\" its feminine equivalent ends with \\"-a.\\" and Monica Harrison. Her father was born in Poland and her mother in England. She attended St John Fisher Roman Catholic SchoolLancashire Evening Post, 25 April 1973, p1 where she started acting. From age 15, she travelled most of the Western world, living at times in London, Madrid, Bilbao and Hamburg, stopping off for stays in Italy and France. Dziubinska worked as a dental nurse in Preston, but found the routine too restrictive. In 1970, she was a finalist in the Miss United Kingdom beauty contest. At the Playboy Club in London, she worked as a blackjack Playboy Bunny for five months. She spent some time in Munich, where Pompeo Posar photographed her for the August 1972 issue of Playboy, in which she appeared in the \\"Girls of Munich\\" pictorial fully clothed save for a sheer white shirt. Dziubinska also appeared as a Page Three girl, a model featured topless on the third page of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun. In the May 1973 issue of Playboy, Dziubinska appeared as the Playmate of the Month. Her centerfold was photographed by Posar. She then became a professional actress and made her film debut in Vampyres. Acting career While at a cocktail party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over to talk to him about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down the Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' Her role in that 1974 horror film, which was directed by José Ramón Larraz, was as Miriam, a lesbian vampire, opposite Marianne Morris. She then played Lola Montez in Ken Russell's rock musical Lisztomania (1975) and Dawn in the comedy The Likely Lads (1976). She was credited as Anulka Dubinska in the latter. Dziubinska's first television appearances were as a girl in an episode of The New Avengers (1976) and as Pavla in two episodes of The Tomorrow People (1977). She was credited as Anulka Dubinska in the latter. Due to the decline of the British film industry in the 1970s, with rampant unionism and high taxes that drove talent abroad, Dziubinska decided to move to the USA. She went to the Writers & Artists Agency in Beverly Hills with an 8 X 10 publicity photograph and was immediately signed. She and American musician Tony Sales were married on 20 August 1978 in Hollywood.California Marriage Index, Groom: Tony F. Sales, Age: 26, Bride: Anulka M.

Dziubinska was cast as Francis in the McLean Stevenson sitcom Hello, Larry episode The Nude Emcee (1979), in which she was credited as Anulka Fox Sales.Note. Fox was the middle name of Dziubinska's husband, Tony Sales, and the maiden name of her mother-in-law. Dziubinska played a tennis pro, Zora Korcek, opposite Tom Selleck's casual detective in an episode of Magnum, P.I. (1982). She played Natasha in two episodes of the soap opera Bare Essence (1983) and Sonya Louis-Dreyfus in one episode of Falcon Crest (1984) starring Jane Wyman.

Biography In 1989, Baumgardt helped to launch Keys, a keyboard and computer magazine in Germany while also working as editor for SOUND CHECK, another musician magazine by the same publisher (PPV). Keys was competing at that time with the much larger and more established German Keyboards magazine. Among the notable articles that Keys featured was an interview with Oskar Sala, the German composer and inventor of the Mixtur- Trautonium, and a round table interview with the leading American manufacturers of synthesizers. In 1994 he also started a book publishing company for Computer Music & Electronic. The first title, Key Report (written by Hans-Joachim Schaefer and Lars Wagner), was a collection of vintage and current synthesizers. However, Baumgardt left the agency and his publishing company to pursue his music. In 1991 he moved to Boston, USA, to study at Berklee College of Music . He continued writing for PAGEPAGE as their US correspondent, a position that he held for many years. Other magazines he wrote for include Internet WorldInternet World , Print ProcessPrint Process , KONR@D,KONR@D c'tc't , Mac DesignMac Design and Photoshop UserPhotoshop User . At that time he also started writing computer books on Desktop Publishing. In only a few years he became the most well known and sought after author in Germany. His books were widely regarded as the best books on the subjects. At one point, three of his books were listed at the same time in the top ten best-selling computer graphic book list. Among his many titles were books on QuarkXPressQuarkXPress 4, Addison-Wesley, 1998 (Addison-Wesley, 1998 ), IllustratorIllustrator, (Addison-Wesley) (Addison-Wesley, 1997 ), Fractal PainterFractal Painter (ITP, 1995), DTP kreativ!DTP kreativ!(Springer, 1996 ), Web Design kreativ! (Springer, 1997 ) and Web Design mit Photoshop 5 (Addison Wesley, 1998 ). Drawn by the Internet Boom he moved in 1996 to New York and published his first book in English (Creative Web Design, Springer Publishing, 1997 ), a computer book on web design and HTML. Having designed all his books, Baumgardt transcended the barriers of books and magazine by including interviews with the leading Web Designer and Information Architects, like Clement Mok and Marc Crumpacker (Studio Archetype). The book that leads to his international breakthrough was “Web Design with Photoshop 5.5”. First published in Germany for Photoshop 5.0 (in 1998), it was picked up by Peachpit Press in the US for version 5.5 of Photoshop and was soon published internationally in Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese and many other languages. Today many consider Baumgardt the leading expert in his field. Scott Kelby, editor-in-chief for Photoshop User magazine, and a well-known Photoshop expert, said about Web Design with Photoshop: “Probably the most comprehensive book on Web Design with Photoshop ever written, and in my opinion the best book on the subject. Every Web designer should have a copy.” In the Photoshop CS1 release (version 8) of Photoshop, Adobe included one of his tutorials in the Welcome Screen. Baumgardt has been also a speaker at several of the Photoshop World Conferences . In 2004 he published QuarkXPress 6 for Print and Web (Peachpit Press), which was highly praised by Shellie Hall , the official Xpress evangelist of Quark.

In modern formal speech, kōvil is also referred to as aalayam, dheva sthaanam by many Hindus. Ambalam is another term used by devotees of the 19th century Tamil monk Vallalar. Another term is 'Thali', ()Thali, தளி= Kovil, given at Wiktionary wikt:ta:தளி and ValaiTamil.com Tamil dictionary.Metraleeswar temple, Kanchipuram. மேற்கு தளி, மெற்றாளி. which also means temple. To Shaivites, the foremost kōvils are Chidambaram temple and Koneswaram temple while for Vaishnavites, Sri Ranganathaswamy temple, Srirangam and Tirumala Venkateswara temple, Tirupati are viewed as important. The kōvils in Tamil Nadu and the kōvils of Sri Lanka have long histories and have always been associated with the ruler of the time. Most kings patronised temple building in their kingdom, and attached water tanks and villages to the shrine to administer. There are over 36,488 Temples in Tamil Nadu alone as registered by Hindu Aranilaya Thurai. The Sangam literature scripted before the common era, refers to some of the temples the early kings of Tamilagam had erected. The songs of the revered Shaiva Nayanars and the Vaishnava Alvār saints that date back to the period 6th to the 9th century CE, provide ample references to the temples of that period. Stone inscriptions found in most temples describe the patronage extended to them by the various rulers. The most ancient temples were built of wood as well as brick and mortar. Up to about 700 CE temples were mostly of the rock-cut type. The Pallava kings were great builders of temples in stone. The Chola dynasty (850-1279 CE) left a number of monuments to their credit such as the Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur. The Cholas added many ornate mandpams or halls to temples and constructed large towers. The Pandya style (until 1350 CE) saw the emergence of huge towers, high wall enclosures and enormous towered gateways (Gopurams). The Vijayanagar Style (1350 - 1560 CE) is famous for the intricacy and beauty especially for the decorated monolithic pillars. The Nayak style (1600 - 1750 CE) is noted for the addition of large prakaram (outer courtyard) (circum-ambulatory paths) and pillared halls.

The film, described as \\"a take- off on beach parties and musicals,\\" is considered to be one of the worst films of all time. Plot Near a small East Coast beach town, in broad daylight and a short distance from shore, a boat dumps a 55-gallon metal drum labeled \\"Danger Radioactive Waste\\" into the ocean. The drum opens upon reaching the bottom, releasing its contents upon a sunken ship and a nearby human skeleton. The skeleton (but apparently not the transparent, tropical fish swimming by) is transformed by the \\"radioactive waste\\" into an aquatic, humanoid monster characterized by bulging eyes, fins, and mouth stuffed with appendages that resemble sausage links. The monster immediately ambulates toward the beach, where a dance party featuring The Del-Aires musical group is in progress. Hank Green, an employee of local scientist Dr. Gavin, attends the beach party with Tina, his immature and drunk girlfriend. While dancing, Tina flirts with Mike, the leader of a motorcycle gang, as Hank talks with Dr. Gavin's adult daughter Elaine. Following a scuffle, Hank and Mike shake hands and ignore Tina, who swims to a rock jetty. Shortly after arriving at the jetty, and as The Del- Aires perform \\"The Zombie Stomp,\\" Tina is attacked and killed by the monster. Tina's body soon thereafter causes a commotion when it washes ashore, still covered in blood. The police investigating Tina's death enlist Dr. Gavin to \\"get to work on this.\\" Dr. Gavin, who proposes Carbon-14 tests as a means to investigate the genetic structure of a tissue sample, comforts Elaine about her romantic feelings toward Hank. Eulabelle, Dr. Gavin's housekeeper and Mammy archetype, then suggests to Dr. Gavin that \\"the voodoo\\" is responsible for Tina's death. Elaine later decides to skip a slumber party with her adult, female friends. The monster, now joined by additional monsters presumably derived from the same radioactive waste-mediated, skeleton transformation mechanism, subsequently attacks the slumber party, killing over 20 of the attendees. The local media - including a young newspaper vendor who repeatedly shouts \\"Extra! Extra! Read all about it!\\" - then begins to report the attacks. An indeterminate time later, three female travelers driving through town on a remote road experience a flat tire. While attempting to replace the tire, they are attacked and killed by the monsters. As Hank and Elaine attend an evening dance party at the beach, with music again provided by The Del-Aires, one of the monsters stalks two young women who are walking through town. Frustrated when the women are picked up by a passing automobile before it can attack them, the monster instead attacks female mannequins on display in a storefront window, in the process severing its arm. Dr. Gavin and Hank later study the severed arm, which is still alive, with Dr. Gavin characterizing the muscle tissue as the taxonomically impossible \\"a sea anemone, a species of protozoa.\\" Although Dr. Gavin and Hank cannot devise a way to kill the arm, Eulabelle accidentally spills a container of impossibly-liquid metallic sodium on the arm, which kills it. Dr. Gavin thus realizes a chemical method for destroying the monsters: application of \\"plain old sodium.\\" Two drunken men stumbling through town encounter a dead, mutilated man inside a parked truck. shocked upon what they see one of the drunks is shortly thereafter attacked and killed by the monsters, thus representing the only males killed by the monsters. Following a montage of additional women being attacked and killed, the police initiate unsuccessful searches for the monsters by tracking the latter's trail of radioactive water. As Hank drives to New York City to obtain a supply of metallic sodium, Elaine performs her own search for the monsters at a local quarry, near where the female travelers were killed. Upon learning this, Dr. Gavin rushes off to assist Elaine, bringing a small amount of sodium with him. As Elaine is testing the quarry water, which registers as highly radioactive, she notices the emergence of a monster. Despite wearing dress shoes she manages to avoid an attack by walking away, but she then falls and becomes incapacitated by a bloody leg injury. Dr. Gavin arrives at her side and, by tossing sodium, kills an approaching monster in a fiery explosion. As additional monsters approach, Dr. Gavin engages one of them in extended Hand- to-hand combat. Hank then arrives with a large supply of sodium, kills the monster that is attacking Dr. Gavin (in the process badly burning Gavin), and with the assistance of police destroys the remaining monsters. As a song by the Del-Aires plays on the radio, Hank later visits and nuzzles the recovering Elaine in her bedroom, wherein one of Eulabelle's Voodoo dolls has been placed on a bedside table. Cast Production The Horror of Party Beach was directed by Del Tenney. His career began as an actor, working at the Los Angeles State College, appearing as an extra in films such as Stalag 17 and The Wild One. After moving to New York to act professionally, he worked as an assistant director in exploitation films, including Satan in High Heels. Tenney was approached by producer Alan Iselin, whose family owned drive-in theaters in Albany, New York, to make a double feature for drive-ins. He offered to put up $50,000 and come up with the titles and pressbooks if Tenney would also contribute $50,000. The titles Iselin created were The Curse of the Living Corpse and Invasion of the Zombies. The original scripts for both films were written by Tenney and his wife Margot Hartman. Unlike most beach party movies filmed to that time, The Horror of Party Beach was shot in black and white and on the Atlantic coast, with the primary filming site being the Shippan Point area of Stamford, Connecticut. The biker gang in the film was portrayed by the Charter Oak Motorcycle Club (described as being \\"affiliated with, but...a step beneath, the Hells Angels\\") of Riverside, Connecticut. The monster costumes were designed by Bob Verberkmoes, a theater set designer, and constructed at Gutzon Borglum's sculpting studio in Stamford. The costume heads sat atop the actors' heads, such that the actor looked through a hole in the costume neck. Two monster costumes were constructed,; upon completion, one was found to be too small for the hired stuntman/actor. Production assistant Ruth Glassenberg Freedman had a 16 year old son, Charles Freedman, who fit perfectly into the small suit, and he was subsequently recruited to portray a monster(s) in the film. The \\"underwater,\\" skeleton transformation scene was shot on a stage, with images of tropical fish in an aquarium later superimposed over the dissolving stage shots. Chocolate syrup was used for blood during the monster attack scenes.. The advertising for the double feature of Horror of Party Beach and Living Corpse capitalized on a gimmick first utilized by director William Castle, in which newspaper advertisements included a call-out that stated: \\"For your protection! We will not permit you to see these shockers unless you agree to release the theater of all responsibility for death by fright!\\" Theaters were encouraged by the distributor to have patrons sign a \\"Fright Release\\" before they took their seats. The trailer for the double feature also included this claim. Although billed in its promotional material as \\"The First Horror Monster Musical,\\" all the songs heard in the film were presented as either soundtrack music or source music, as opposed to the style of a traditional musical with songs sung by central characters of the story. Ray Dennis Steckler's The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies also made the same claim a few months earlier.Chad Plambeck, Bad Movie Planet November 15, 2009 As a tie-in, a monographic fumetti comic book by Wally Wood and Russ Jones detailing the film's story was released by the Warren Publishing Company under its Famous Films masthead. It has a 35-cent cover price.Glenn Erickson, DVD Savant Edward Earle Marsh (aka Zebedy Colt) composed the film's soundtrack; Wilfred Holcombe was credited as the musical director. Marsh and Holcombe wrote three songs that were performed in the film: \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"The Zombie Stomp\\" and \\"You Are Not a Summer Love.\\" Gary Robert Jones and Ronnie Linares, both of the Del-Aires (a Paterson, New Jersey rock band who play themselves in the film, wrote one song together, \\"Drag,\\" and one song each individually: \\"Wigglin' Wobblin'\\" (Jones) and \\"Elaine\\" (Linares). The Del- Aires performed all six songs in the film. Reception =Release= The movie was distributed by 20th Century Fox. In 2018, it was released on Blu-ray by Severin Films. =Critical response= The Horror of Party Beach has received substantial critical attention, and has been recognized by film critics as one of the worst films of all time.The worst movies of all time, or, What were they thinking? Michael Sauter; Carol Pub. Group, 1999 358 pages, page 306 Upon the film's release, a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, \\"The most to be said for [Tenney] is that he has not stinted on the gore,\\"New York Times Movie Review April 30, 1964 and a review in Newsweek, which was negatively critical of the musical numbers performed by the Del-Aires, considered it the worst film in the previous twelve months, with the possible exception being Blood Feast. Additional negative commentary on the film has come from Thomas Lisanti in his book Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959–1969 (\\"by far the worst of the sixties beach films\\") and the author Stephen King (\\"an abysmal little wet fart of a film.\\")Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959–1969 By Thomas Lisanti, number 8 Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film a \\"BOMB\\" rating, calling it \\"one of the earliest anti-nuclear warning films\\", but also stated that it failed to get its message across. Film critic Michael Medved included the movie in his books The Fifty Worst Films of All Time and Son of Golden Turkey Awards. The latter book recognized the movie as \\"The Worst Beach Movie Ever Made\\". Despite giving it a negative reception, Medved cited the film as the catalyst of his fascination for bad movies and described The Horror of Party Beach as a \\"good bad movie.\\" Joe Meyers in the Hearst newspaper blog for the Stamford Advocate wrote upon the death of Del Tenney: \\"Connecticut had its own Ed Wood, an actor, director and entrepreneur named Del Tenney who made a series of truly awful pictures in the Stamford area during the 1960s, the most notorious of which is Horror of Party Beach, a 1964 drive-in quickie about an atomic mutation that terrorizes Stamford.\\" In popular culture The punk band Sloppy Seconds named one of their songs after the movie for their 1989 album Destroyed. The Horror of Party Beach was featured in an eighth-season (1997) episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), an American television comedy series. In 2016, Shout! Factory released the MST3K episode as part of the \\"Volume XXXVII\\" DVD collection of the series, along with The Human Duplicators, Escape 2000, and Invasion of the Neptune Men.

Route description The southern terminus of SR 739 is an intersection with US 41 near San Carlos Park. SR 739 is known as Michael G. Rippe Parkway for its first three miles. Immediately north of the southern terminus is an interchange with Alico Road (CR 840) which includes only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. SR 739 crosses the interchange and the Seminole Gulf Railway on a large overpass. From the Alico interchange, SR 739 becomes six lanes and continues north, paralleling the Seminole Gulf Railway and passing through the Briarcliff neighborhood. At its intersection with Six Mile Cypress Parkway (SR 865) in south Fort Myers, SR 739 becomes known as Metro Parkway and continues northward. It is reduced to five lanes with a middle turn lane at the intersection with Daniels Parkway (CR 876). SR 739 then passes to the east of the Villas neighborhood, Page Field, and the Chico's World Headquarters. It intersects with Colonial Boulevard (SR 884), Lee County's primary east-west highway, shortly after entering Fort Myers city limits. At Winkler Avenue, SR 739 becomes six lanes again and turns northwest. An overpass carries it over the Ten Mile Canal and the Seminole Gulf Railway. At LeeTran Boulevard, the northbound lanes continue onto Evans Avenue, while the southbound lanes connect to Fowler Street. SR 739 continues north along Evans Avenue and Fowler Street. Currently, Evans Avenue is a one-way street north of LeeTran Boulevard, and has three northbound lanes while Fowler Street carries four lanes of bi-directional traffic. This unusual configuration continues to just south of downtown Fort Myers at the intersection of State Road 82 (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). Fowler Street's northbound lanes terminate at SR 82, and from here north, Evans Avenue (which becomes Park Avenue shortly after SR 82) carries all northbound traffic, and Fowler Street carries all southbound traffic with three lanes each. At the intersection with SR 80 just east of downtown Fort Myers, SR 739 becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 41 Business, and SR 739 becomes a hidden designation from this point north. It then intersects SR 80 and crosses the Caloosahatchee River on the Edison Bridge. The northbound and southbound streets rejoin into a single six-lane roadway at the north end of the Edison Bridge spans, and travel into North Fort Myers, Florida along the original Tamiami Trail. SR 739 is then reduced to four lanes divided after the intersection of Pine Island Road/Bayshore Road (SR 78), and terminates shortly after at the mainline of US 41 north of North Fort Myers. History The northern portion of SR 739 through North Fort Myers was originally part of the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41), a roadway connecting Tampa and Miami. The route through North Fort Myers was completed by 1931, and was part of US 41 until 1964 when it moved to a new alignment to the west. The Metro Parkway portion of SR 739 initially ran from Hanson Street (at Old Metro Parkway) to Colonial Boulevard in the 1980s, but was extended to Daniels Parkway due to a boom in need for new business sites. It was extended to Six Mile Cypress Parkway in the early 1990s due to the building of Gulf Coast Medical Center. SR 739 was split into its current alignment of one-way street pairs north of SR 82 in the early 1990s when the current dual Edison Bridge spans were completed, replacing the original drawbridge. More of Evans Avenue was converted to one- way as far south as Hanson Street in 2008 to carry SR 739 northbound. This was part of a larger project that would have later converted the adjacent segment of Fowler Street to one-way to be Evans Avenue's southbound counterpart. However, further conversion of Fowler Street was heavily opposed by the city of Fort Myers and local business owners, and was subsequently cancelled (though Evans Avenue's conversion had already been completed). SR 739 was extended to its current southern terminus in late 2012 with the completion of the Michael G. Rippe Parkway portion. That extension, which was named for former Florida Department of Transportation district director Michael G. Rippe, had been planned as early as the 1990s and was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The current alignment of SR 739 between Winkler Avenue and Hanson Street was completed in late 2015. Prior to then, SR 739 continued north along Old Metro Parkway and connected to Fowler Street via Hanson Street. Evans Avenue is named for Major James Evans, who is one of the founders of Fort Myers.

Cosby's follow up book, Childhood, published in November 1992, emulated the style with which Schoenstein wrote Fatherhood. Comedian Paul Reiser's books Babyhood (1996) and Couplehood (1998), too, are pastiches of Fatherhood.

Giant Rock was purported to be the largest free standing boulder in the world until a large piece broke off in 2000. Native Americans of the Joshua Tree, California, area consider it to be sacred. In the 1930s, Frank Critzer moved to Giant Rock. Inspired by desert tortoises that dig holes in which to cool themselves, Critzer dug out a home on the north side of the rock using dynamite. He engineered a rainwater- collection system and a tunnel for ventilation. The underground home was reportedly never hotter than 80 degrees and never cooler than 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Critzer built an airstrip on the nearby ancient lakebed, which averaged a plane a day by 1941. Critzer perished in a self-detonated dynamite explosion in his underground rooms on July 24, 1942, while being investigated by local police.Ed Ainsworth, Plans For 'Out of This World' Laboratory In Desert Disclosed (Los Angeles Times: June 17, 1954), pg.A1. In the 1950s, Giant Rock was a gathering point for UFO believers. It is located on land which was at that time leased by George Van Tassel, a friend of Critzer's, a purported flying-saucer contactee and organizer of UFO conventions. In 1947, Van Tassel, a former aircraft inspector, leased the property from the Bureau of Land Management and left Los Angeles and moved to Giant Rock with his wife and three children. Van Tassel also built the nearby Integratron and a cafe, store, gas station and the Giant Rock Airport, which he operated from 1947 to 1975. The Giant Rock Airport was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for emergency use by commercial airliners. In the early 1960's it experienced traffic of about one flight per day. Between November, 1961 and October, 1962, it served as the launch site for helium-filled balloons used by R. F.

It has also been used in heraldry. The emblem is often interpreted as symbolizing the reward in heaven (the crown) coming after the trials in this life (the cross) (James 1:12). Lutheran composer J.S. Bach's cantata Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 (1714) contains an aria \\"Kreuz und Krone sind verbunden, Kampf und Kleinod sind vereint\\" (\\"cross and crown are bound together, conflict and jewel are united\\") which has been connected with Luther's rendering of 1 Corinthians 9:24-25. Uses and background In addition to Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian uses, the symbol also appears in the seal of the Church of Christ, Scientist, where it is surrounded by the words \\"Heal the Sick, Cleanse the Lepers, Raise the Dead, Cast Out Demons\\", from the Gospel of Matthew, 10:8. The symbol is also associated with Freemasonry, specifically the Knight Templar degree of the York Rite of Freemasonry. The symbol is also known as \\"Knight Templars Blood-Red Passion Cross and Crown\\". The cross and crown symbol is often surrounded by the phrase \\"In Hoc Signo Vinces\\", which is Latin for \\"By this sign thou shalt conquer\\". This is a reference to the story of Constantine, who reportedly had a vision of a Chi Rho symbol, and a voice saying \\"By this sign thou shalt conquer\\". The symbol was used particularly by the Bible Student movement. The symbol was also featured in the early publications and memorabilia of the International Bible Students Association. First appearing on the cover of the January 1881 issue of Zion's Watch Tower, the cross and crown were surrounded by a wreath of laurel leaves, and the symbol was also used on lapel pins, buttons (metal and celluloid) and pendants of various designs. However, not all of its uses by the I.B.S.A. included the wreath of laurel leaves. Although Charles Taze Russell's gravesite is marked by a pyramid memorial erected by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society with an illustration of the Cross and Crown symbol, the Watchtower Society later discontinued using the cross and crown some years after, viewing it as a \\"pagan symbol\\" - their doctrine for some time since is that Jesus was executed not on a cross but on an upright stake. The Cross and Crown symbol is also the key emblem of the Royal Black Institution, (a sister organisation of the Orange Order), a Protestant fraternity, with structural and symbolic links to Freemasonry. The Cross and Crown symbol also appears on the cover of the 1998 book, The Power of the Cross, by Tim Lahaye. References  External links  * The Cross and Crown symbol in cemeteries.

The English title is a play on the slang \\"WTF\\", short for 'What The Fuck?', indicating confusion. WTF was released in Japan on December 22, 2005, and in America on October 17, 2006. On October 2, 2008 it became available for download from the PlayStation Store. The game's humor is derived from its satirical take on temporary or part-time employment. Players are paid a pittance for repetitive, menial tasks, with the only way to unlock more varied jobs being to grind through the boring ones. There is also an in- game email system, through which players can receive emails from fellow employees, award notices, and even spam offers which can decrease the player's funds. Gameplay The game contains over forty minigames, representing inane part-time jobs the player receives from the \\"Job Demon\\", which must be completed in a certain amount of time and at a certain difficulty, depending on the level. Examples include counting chickens (sorting newborn chicks into male, female, or dying), chopping wood (while trying not to chop cute cartoon animals that sometimes get put on the chopping block), putting caps on pens in a factory, karate, and other humorously repetitive minigames. By completing these minigames, the player earns money which can be used at a gashapon machine to randomly receive a new minigame, prizes for the gallery, or even a gadget that the player can use on the PSP outside of the game, such as a clock. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one seven, one eight, one seven, and one six, for a total of 28 out of 40.

The band released three albums, Barbie's Cradle, Music from the Buffet Table, and Playing in the Fields, the last two of which featured lyrics notable for their Christian- oriented content, brought about by personal changes in the life of songwriter Almalbis. Aside from Almalbis, members over the years included Rommel de la Cruz who played bass throughout the band's existence; drummers Franklin Benitez and Wendell Garcia, who were part of the band before and after the release of Music from the Buffet Table respectively, and Kakoi Legaspi, who took up a second guitar position just prior to the band's dissolution in 2005. Origins The first incarnation, called Hungry Young Poets started as a duo in 1997 by Barbie Almalbis (guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter) and Ricci Gurango (bassist). After releasing their only self-titled album, Franklin Benitez (drummer) would officially complete the trio. In 1998, Gurango left the band to lead cover band, Little Green Men, before forming MOJOFLY. With Gurango's assertion of rights to the band's name, Almalbis and Benitez would later rename the group, Barbie's Cradle.  Albums and Lineup over the years  The band's original lineup consisted of Barbie Almalbis on vocals and guitar, Franklin Benitez on drums, and Rommel De La Cruz on Bass. This was the lineup that performed at a Manila show by Sixpence None The Richer and which recorded the song \\"Tabing Ilog\\" to serve as the title song for an afternoon soap opera of the same name. Soon after, the band would release their Eponymous first album, Barbie's Cradle in late 1999. Drummer Franklin Benitez would leave the band before the release in 2000 of the band's second album, Music from the Buffet Table. Some of the tracks on that album were thus performed by Benitez, and some by Wendell Garcia. That album would be significant for introducing the Christian-themed lyrics that would be Barbie's Cradle's trademark until its disbandment, and of Barbie Almalbis as a solo artist thereafter. The highly successful trio of Almalbis, De La Cruz, and Garcia, with their now-distinctive spiritually influenced songs, released Playing in the Fields in 2003. In 2005, Rivermaya guitarist Kakoi Legaspi left that group to become part of Barbie's Cradle. Almalbis, however, decided to take up a solo career, which meant that no full Barbie's Cradle album would be made with the addition of Legaspi's guitar performance. The new Barbie's Cradle sound, with Legaspi's contribution, however, can be heard in the \\"Good Day\\" track which was released in Barbie: The Singles, a compilation album released in 2005 featuring songs by Hungry Young Poets, Barbie's Cradle, and Almalbis as a solo artist.  After Barbie's Cradle  The band had one last performance as one of the performers at a benefit concert for the Philippine National Red Cross, in UP Diliman's Bahay ng Alumni. After Almalbis left the band in 2005 to pursue a solo career, the other members of the group eventually took up positions in other bands. Rommel De La Cruz would take up the post of bass player in Freestyle, Wendell Garcia became the drummer for Pupil, and Kakoi Legaspi would be one of the founders of Salindiwa. Franklin Benitez worked with Almalbis again, taking up the drums for Almalbis' later albums as a solo artist.

There have been nine World Roma Congresses to date. Among the chief goals of these congresses have been the standardization of the Romani language, improvements in civil rights and education, preservation of the Roma culture, reparations from World War II, and international recognition of the Roma as a national minority of Indian native origin. First World Romani Congress The first World Romani Congress was organized in 1971 in Orpington near London, England, United Kingdom, funded in part by the World Council of Churches and the Government of India. It was attended by 23 representatives from nine nations (Czechoslovakia, Finland, Norway, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Spain and Yugoslavia) and observers from Belgium, Canada, India and the United States. Five sub-commissions were created to examine social affairs, education, war crimes, language, and culture. At the congress, the green and blue flag from the 1933 conference of the General Association of the Gypsies of Romania, embellished with the red, sixteen-spoked chakra, was reaffirmed as the national emblem of the Roma people, and the song \\"Gelem, Gelem\\" was adopted as the Roma anthem. Usage of the word \\"Roma\\" (rather than variants of \\"gypsy\\") was also accepted by a majority of attendees; as a result, the International Gypsy Committee (founded in 1965) was renamed the Komiteto Lumniako Romano (International Rom Committee).Timeline of Romani History - Patrin Second World Romani Congress The second Congress in April 1978, was held in Geneva, Switzerland and attended by 120 delegates from 26 countries. Attendees helped transform the International Rom Committee into the International Romani Union.Timeline of Romani History - Patrin Third World Romani Congress The third Congress was held in Göttingen, West Germany in May 1981, with 600 delegates and observers from 28 different countries. Attendees supported the call for Roma to be recognized as a national minority of Indian origin. The Porajmos was a major topic of discussion. Fourth World Romani Congress In 1990, the fourth Congress was held in Serock, Poland with 250 delegates attending. Discussion topics included World War II reparations, education, culture, public relations, language, and a Romani language encyclopedia. The International Day of the Roma was also officially declared as April 8, in honour of the first World Romani Congress meeting in 1971. Fifth World Romani Congress The fifth World Romani Congress was held in Prague, Czech Republic in July, 2000. Emil Ščuka was elected as president of the International Romani Union. The Congress produced the official Declaration of the Romani non-territorial nation. Sixth World Romani Congress The sixth Congress was held in Lanciano, Italy on October 8 & 9, 2004, with participation from over 200 delegates from 39 countries of world. Delegates chose a new president for the International Romani Union (Stanisław Stankiewicz of Poland) and a new president of the World Parliament of the IRU (Dragan Jevremovic of Austria). A new committee was set up to examine issues surrounding women, families and children. Seventh World Romani Congress The seventh Congress was held in Zagreb, Croatia in October 2008. Almost 300 delegates from 28 different countries attended the meeting, which released The Roma Nation Building Action Plan, a document which outlined plans for the development of Romani nationalism and representation. Esma Redžepova performed the Romani anthem. Eighth World Romani Congress The eighth Congress was held in Sibiu, Romania in April 2013. Approximately 250 delegates from 34 different countries attended the meeting.  Ninth World Romani Congress  The ninth Congress was held in Riga, Latvia in August 2015, Approximately 250 delegates from 25 countries were in attendance.

Shrugs are typically worn as the outermost layer of an outfit, with a full shirt, tank top, or dress beneath. A shrug covers a small portion of the upper body. Some shrugs are tied together just below the bustline. Another style is cut off at the sides and thus little more than a pair of sleeves joined at the back.

Co-written by Ephron and her sister Delia, the film features an ensemble cast which includes Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, Rita Wilson, Anthony LaPaglia, Garry Shandling, Juliette Lewis, Adam Sandler and, in his first film role, Liev Schreiber. The film was released theatrically on December 21, 1994 and was both critically and commercially unsuccessful. Plot The plot begins on Christmas Eve, with ex-con Felix running from his angry, pregnant wife, Gracie, as she chases him down the road. He accidentally runs into and damages a Christmas tree carried by two rollerbladers. When an argument breaks out among them, a stranger, Philip, unsuccessfully attempts to calm them down. They soon disperse. Philip, head of the suicide-prevention hotline \\"Lifesavers\\", receives an eviction notice from his landlord, Stanley, after being unable to pay the organization's rent for several months. In addition to him, the hotline is staffed by the selfish, neurotic, and rather fearful office manager, Mrs. Blanche Munchnik and the overly emotional and empathetic supervisor Catherine O'Shaughnessy. Philip, who does not inform his coworkers of the eviction, attempts to convince his girlfriend, Susan, who is a loan officer in a local bank, to grant him a small loan. She refuses the loan before telling him that she has been secretly dating a psychiatrist for four months and is breaking up with him. Despite Catherine's expectation that \\"you'd expect everyone to be thinking of jumping out of windows or slitting their wrists on Christmas Eve\\", the staff has received few calls. There is one phone call from a woman who is frightened by a notorious Los Angeles serial killer dubbed \\"the Seaside Strangler,\\" and another from Chris, a transgender woman, who convinces Philip to disclose Lifesavers' office address. Meanwhile, an elevator malfunction leaves Mrs. Munchnik trapped on her way to Christmas Eve dinner. Philip eventually manages to pull her to the top of the elevator when Gracie arrives and attempts to operate it. They are terrified that they will be crushed by the ceiling of the elevator shaft, but eventually they all manage to return to the office. Felix arrives, begging Gracie to listen to him, and she hits him in the head with a fruitcake, causing a large cut on his forehead. Philip and Catherine take him to a veterinarian to be treated for his head wound. While the doctor is distracted discussing relationships and pillows with Philip, Felix steals and quickly overdoses on dog tranquilizers and is taken to a hospital. Meanwhile, at the office, the doorbell rings. Gracie quickly throws the door open, accidentally striking Mrs. Munchnik and revealing Chris in the doorway. Gracie leaves Chris to care for the unconscious Mrs. Munchnik. When Philip returns, Chris is sitting on the sofa and convinces him to dance with her. When Mrs. Munchnik awakens, she witnesses the dancing and threatens to sue Philip for withholding information of the eviction and for \\"inappropriate office behavior\\" before leaving. Soon, Gracie, Catherine, and a downstairs neighbor named Louie Capshaw, all return to the office with Chinese food. Meanwhile, her car fixed by the car club, Blanche encounters the fruitcake again, as it has landed and hit her window, after Philip has a fit and throws it out of the office window. She is distraught, sitting on her car bumper, as fellow neighbor Mr. Lobel walks up to her with his three dogs in tow. Soon, they're having sex on the beach. An hour later, Felix arrives at the office brandishing a gun, having escaped from the hospital. Chris gets shot in the foot after attempting to disarm him. Gracie takes the gun and shoots wildly around the office to empty it of ammunition. Two shots go through the front door, killing Stanley, who was standing behind it with a bag of his possessions. The sight of the dead Stanley puts Catherine in shock. Philip prepares a bath to calm her down, realizes that he is strongly attracted to her, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Chris takes a mutual romantic interest in Louie, who sings impromptu songs on his prized ukelele. Gracie and Felix disguise Stanley's body as a Christmas tree with burlap and super glue, and the decision is made to take it and the bag to the boardwalk and leave it there. As they all carry Stanley's body down the street, they encounter the now-vengeful rollerbladers, who barrel through them. Felix tosses the tree and it crashes to the ground, revealing Stanley's body. When the police arrive, Philip falsely confesses to the killing, but Gracie pulls out the gun as proof of her guilt. Felix grabs it and runs to the roof of a nearby building, where he threatens to commit suicide. Philip soon convinces him to climb down, to much applause. Catherine hands Stanley's bag to the detectives, who search it. They find fishing line and kelp, the weapons of choice for the Seaside Strangler. Stanley was the Seaside Strangler all along. For killing the criminal, Gracie receives the reward of $250,000. She offers to pay for Lifesavers' moving expenses, then promptly goes into labor. She gives birth in the first few hours of Christmas Day in a scene that resembles the Nativity of Jesus. Philip then asks Catherine to marry him. At the end credits, we see a wall Felix has painted everything he told Gracie from earlier he would do once he had a wall.

Route description SR 758 northbound past southern terminus at SR 72 in Siesta Key SR 758 begins at an intersection with the western terminus of SR 72 in Siesta Key, heading northwest on Midnight Pass Road, a two-lane divided highway. The median becomes a center left-turn lane as the road heads through resort residential and commercial areas a short distance to the east of the Gulf of Mexico. SR 758 turns north to remain on Midnight Pass Road, with CR 789A (Beach Road) heading west to Siesta Beach. Midnight Pass Road continues as a two-lane undivided road passing through residential neighborhoods, curving to the northwest. SR 758 intersects CR 789A again and turns north onto Higel Avenue, passing more homes in the northern part of Siesta Key. The state road turns east onto Siesta Drive, running through more residential areas. The road crosses Sarasota Bay on a drawbridge and heads into Sarasota, lined with more residences. SR 758 turns south onto South Osprey Avenue, a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that passes through residential and commercial areas. The state road curves east onto Bay Road and passes more businesses as it comes to an intersection with US 41/SR 45. Upon crossing US 41/SR 45, SR 758 becomes Bee Ridge Road, widening into a seven-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road passes through a mix of homes and businesses, intersecting South Shade Avenue before crossing Phillippi Creek. The state road heads east through more developed areas, crossing South Tuttle Avenue/Swift Road, South Lockwood Ridge Road, Beneva Road, and Sawyer Road. The road crosses a Seminole Gulf Railway line and intersects McIntosh Road, where just east of that at Bond Place it becomes a four-laned divided highway. Then it crosses Honore Avenue, and just before it intersects with Cattlemen Road it becomes a six-laned divided highway as it continues through areas of residential neighborhoods and businesses. SR 758 reaches its eastern terminus slightly east of an interchange with I-75/SR 93 in Bee Ridge, with the unnumbered Bee Ridge Road continuing to the east as a four-lane divided road until an intersection with Mauna Loa Boulevard. East of this intersection, Bee Ridge Road continues for approximately three miles as a four-lane divided road.

After the Battle of Amblève in 716, King Chilperic and Ragenfrid returned defeated to Neustria. Instead of following them at once, Charles again used tactics he would use all his remaining life, in a successful military career. He took time to rally more men and prepare, before descending in full force. By the following spring, Martel had attracted enough support to confront the Neustrians..Costambeys, Marios, Innes, Matthew, and MacLean, Simon.

Charles eventually followed them and dealt them a serious blow at Vincy on 21 March 717. He pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris. On this success, he proclaimed Clotaire IV king of Austrasia in opposition to Chilperic and deposed the bishop of Rheims, Rigobert, replacing him with one Milo.

The current City Seal was adopted for use in 1827, possibly inspired by a famous speech and toast made by sixth President John Quincy Adams (1767-1848) / [served 1825-1829], on a visit and tour in 1827, in which he dubbed the city with its most well-known nickname of \\"The Monumental City\\", with the recent erection of several monuments, including this for the War of 1812 and the new Washington Monument column, nearing completion in a wooded park, just north of the booming city. The seal is in the shape of an ellipse with the image of the Battle Monument featured in its center The iconic monument, designed by Frenchman J. Maximilian Godefroy, (1765-c.1838), erected 1815-1822, in the former colonial era Courthouse Square (where the Declaration of Independence had been read to the town populace on July 29, 1776) for the casualties suffered during the recent War of 1812 when the British invasion with a land/sea attack in September 1814, in the Battle of Baltimore, with the land conflict southeast of the city on the Patapsco Neck peninsula with several thousands of the King's Army at the Battle of North Point and the subsequent Royal Navy fleet blockade and bombardment of Fort McHenry, south of the town, protecting the entrance to the Patapsco River of Baltimore harbor.

He is regarded, alongside Ivan Cankar, Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn, as the beginner of modernism in Slovene literature. In the period following World War I, Župančič was frequently regarded as the greatest Slovenian poet after Prešeren,Fran Erjavec, Slovenija in Slovenci (Ljubljana: Slovenska straža, 1940) but in the last forty years his influence has been declining and his poetry has lost much of its initial appeal.Boštjan M.

His father Franc Zupančič was a wealthy village merchant, his mother Ana Malić was of Croatian origin.Janko Kos, Slovenska književnost (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, 1982), 413 He attended high school in Novo Mesto and in Ljubljana. In the Carniolan capital, he initially frequented the circle of Catholic intellectuals around the social activist, author and politician Janez Evangelist Krek, but later turned to the freethinking circle of young Slovene modernist artists, among whom were Ivan Cankar, Dragotin Kette and Josip Murn.Janko Kos, ibid. In 1896, he went to study history and geography at the University of Vienna. He stayed in Vienna until 1900, but never completed his studies.Janko Kos, Pregled slovenskega slovstva (Ljubljana: DZS, 1983), 267 In the Austrian capital, he became acquainted with the contemporary currents in European art, especially the Viennese Secession and fin de siècle literature. He also met with Ruthenian students from eastern Galicia who introduced him to Ukrainian folk poetry, which had an important influence on Župančič's future poetic development.Janko Kos, op.cit., 269 In 1900, he returned to Ljubljana, where he taught as a substitute teacher at the Ljubljana Classical Gymnasium. He started to publish his poetry in the liberal literary magazine Ljubljanski zvon, where he clashed with one of its editors and the most influential Slovene author of that time, Anton Aškerc. In 1905, he traveled to Paris and settled in Germany, where he worked as a private tutor until 1910.Janko Kos, ibid.Janko Glazer, \\"Spremna beseda\\" in Oton Župančič, Izbrane pesmi (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1963), 113 In 1910, he returned to Ljubljana and worked as a stage director at the Drama Theater of Ljubljana. In 1912, the national liberal mayor of Ljubljana Ivan Tavčar employed him as the director of the City Archive, a post previously occupied by Župančič's former opponent, Anton Aškerc.Janko Kos, op.cit., 267 The following year, 1913, he married Ana Kessler (Ana Župančič), daughter of the socialite Marija Kessler and sister of the poet Vera Albreht, who was married to the author Fran Albreht. In 1920, he returned to his previous job as a stage director and later manager of the Drama Theater. During the Italian Fascist and Nazi German partition and annexation of Slovenia in World War II, Župančič sympathized with the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People and wrote poems under different pseudonyms for underground communist journals. After the end of the war in 1945, he was given several honorary positions and awards by the new communist regime.Janko Kos, Slovenska književnost, op.cit., 414 During that period, he was dubbed \\"the people's poet.\\"Ženja Leiler et al., Slovenska kultura v XX. stoletju (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga - Delo, 2002), 114 He died in Ljubljana on 11 June 1949 and was buried with full honours in Žale Cemetery on 14 June, in the same grave as his friends from childhood Ivan Cankar, Dragotin Kette, and Josip Murn. His older son Marko Župančič was a renowned architect, and his younger son Andrej O. Župančič was a pathologist, anthropologist, and author.  Work  Župančič published his first collection of poems in 1899 under the title Čaša opojnosti (The Goblet of Inebriation). The collection, published at the same time and by the same publisher as Cankar's controversial book Erotika (Eroticism), was a compendium of poems from Župančič's earlier periods, when he was strongly influenced by the decadent movement.Janko Kos, Pregled slovenskega slovstva, op.cit. 270 The two books marked the beginning of modernism in Slovenian literature and caused a controversy. All issues of Cankar's Erotika were bought by the Ljubljana Bishop Anton Bonaventura Jeglič and destroyed, and Župančič's Čaša opojnosti was condemned by the most renowned Slovene conservative thinker of the time, the neo-thomist philosopher Aleš Ušeničnik.Literature in Context. Oton Župančič: recepcija doma Župančič's later poems showed little influence of decadentism, but remained close to a vitalist and pantheist vision of the world and nature. He gradually turned from pure subjective issues to social, national, and political concerns. Already in 1900, he published the highly influential poem Pesem mladine (The Song of Youth), on the occasion of the centenary of Prešeren's birth, written as a battle song of his generation. In his masterpiece Duma from 1908, the visions of an idyllic rural life and natural beauty are mixed with implicit images of social unrest, emigration, impoverishment, and economic decay of the contemporary agricultural society. The poems Kovaška (The Blacksmith's Song, 1910) and Žebljarska (The Nail Maker's Song, 1912) are a powerful lyrical glorification of the vital and moral strength of oppressed manual workers. The poetry collection that Župančič is best known for is the book of children's poetry Ciciban, published in 1915. Župančič was also a prolific and talented translator. He is best known for his translations of the majority of Shakespeare's plays into Slovene, but he also translated other important authors, including Dante, Calderón de la Barca, Molière, Goethe, Balzac, Stendhal, Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, Anatole France, Voltaire, George Bernard Shaw, Knut Hamsun, G. K. Chesterton, and Rostand. Župančič also wrote two plays, Noč za verne duše (A Night for Faithful Souls, 1904) and Veronika Deseniška (Veronika of Desenice, 1924), which were staged during the time when he headed the Drama Theater in Ljubljana. In 1940, Župančič collaborated in the production of the documentary O, Vrba, which presented the Prešeren House, where the Slovene national poet France Prešeren was born, and his home village of Vrba. The film was directed by and published after the war in 1945. The house was presented by Fran Saleški Finžgar, who led its arrangement into a museum, and Župančič read Prešeren's poem \\"O Vrba\\". This is a rare preserved record of his voice.  Controversies  Župančič in the 1930s Already during his lifetime, Župančič was frequently accused of being excessively pragmatic and a political opportunist.Janko Kos, \\"Prevrednotenje Otona Župančiča\\" in Nova revija, n. 198 (1998), 105–119 In the 1920s, he was a staunch supporter of the cultural policies of the Yugoslav monarchy, which aimed to create a unified Yugoslav nation. After 1929, he supported the centralist dictatorship of King Alexander of Yugoslavia. In 1932, he published an article in the journal Ljubljanski zvon entitled \\"Louis Adamic and Slovene Identity\\", in which he claimed that the Slovenes should not be too preoccupied about their language because they can keep their identity even if they lose the language. The article, published in a period when the Yugoslav authorities were sponsoring the official use of Serbo-Croatian in the Drava Province and when even the name Slovenia was officially banned, caused a huge controversy and a split in the journal Ljubljanski zvon.Fran Albreht, Kriza Ljubljanskega zvona (Ljubljana: Kritika, 1932) The literary critic Josip Vidmar rejected Župančič's views in his well- known polemic book The Cultural Problem of Slovene Identity. Although Župančič remained a monarchist and Yugoslav nationalist until the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he welcomed the new communist regime after 1945.Janko Kos, \\"Oton Župančič\\" in Slovenska kultura XX. stoletja, op.cit. Already in September 1943, he published the poem \\"Zlato jabolko\\" (The Golden Apple), which some have interpreted as advocating ruthless revenge against the Slovenian Home Guard, an anti-communist militia that collaborated with the German army.Drago Jančar, \\"Temna stran meseca\\" in Konec tisočletja, račun stoletja (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1999) The summary killings of around 12,000 war prisoners of the Slovene Home Guard in May and June 1945, perpetrated by the communist regime, shed a sinister light on Župančič's war poem, although there are divergent opinions on its exact meaning.Speech of Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša on the anniversary of the end of World War Two (May 2005) Article in the journal Mladina criticizing Janša's interpretation of Župančič's versesJanko Kos, \\"Oton Župančič\\" in Slovenska kultura XX. stoletja, op.cit.  Influence and legacy  During most of his lifetime, Župančič was regarded as a great author. He enjoyed the status of the national poet second only to Prešeren. In 1931, the French linguist Lucien Tesnière published a book on Župančič (Oton Joupantchhitch: poète slovène. L'homme et l'oeuvre), which was important for the popularization of Župančič's poetry in France. During his lifetime, his works were only translated into French and Serbo-Croatian. Translations into German, English, Hungarian (by Sándor Weöres), Macedonian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Czech, and Slovak have been published since. Župančič has had relatively little influence on the younger generations of Slovene authors. Nevertheless, many of his verses and utterances have become catchphrases or common cultural references. Today, he is still very popular as an author of children's literature. His collection of children's poetry called Ciciban (also known as Mehurčki 'Bubbles') has been published in more than 30 editions since it was first issued in 1915. Numerous streets, public buildings, and institutions in Slovenia as well as in Slovene- inhabited areas of Italy and Austria are named after him.

The host was Wink Martindale, and the co-host/announcer was Jennifer Lyall. It was taped in Vancouver, British Columbia. In the Los Angeles-produced pilot, Burton Richardson was the announcer, and Jana White operated the computer and acted as co-host. The show was distributed by Turner Program Services. Gameplay Two teams consisting of a celebrity and a civilian contestant competed to guess groups words that had something in common in order to win cash and prizes. The civilians received all winnings credited to their teams. Among the celebrities who appeared include Jill Whelan, Ted Lange, Susan Ruttan, and Gordon Jump. =Main game= A puzzle consisting of three rows of blanks was displayed, representing three related words, and one letter of each word was filled in at the outset. The player in control pressed a button to stop a randomizer that flashed around the board. If it stopped on an empty space, that letter was filled in and the player could either try to guess the word or pass control to the opponent. When a player guessed, the remaining letters were revealed one at a time, starting from the leftmost, until either they had all been revealed (indicating a correct guess) or a letter came up that differed from the guess. However, the final letter of any word remained hidden on an incorrect guess. A correct guess awarded the option to either guess another word or pass, while an incorrect guess gave control to the opponent. If the randomizer stopped on a letter that had already been filled in, the player had to choose one unrevealed letter in any word to be filled in and the opponent took control. The player who solved the last word won the puzzle, regardless of who solved the first two, and received prizes for the team based on the number of words he/she had solved in that puzzle. The first team to win two puzzles won the match and advanced to the bonus round. Only one person played for each team at any given moment; the first two puzzles were played by one celebrity and the opposing civilian, and the third (if necessary) was played by both civilians. If time ran out in the middle of a puzzle, all the words were revealed and a new puzzle was played at the start of the next episode. =Bonus round: The 60 Second Challenge= The winning team had 60 seconds to solve 10 puzzles. For each puzzle, two one-word clues were given and the letters of a third word were revealed one at a time until only one letter remained. Multiple guesses were allowed from either member. The team won a $100 gift certificate for each correct answer, and solving all 10 won a prize package which had a new prize added to it for each attempt in which it was not won; the largest jackpot awarded during the show's brief run was $46,500. The civilians switched celebrity partners after each bonus round, and the first civilian to win two matches became champion and remained on the show to face a new challenger, competing until they were defeated or held their title for a total of six matches, whichever came first.

She was the wife of Ramón Menéndez Pidal. Ramón Menéndez Pidal and María Goyri in 1900. Newlyweds on the route of El Cid. Archivo Digital Menéndez Pidal. Life Born in Madrid to a Basque family, she spent her early years in Algorta, a seaside village in the province of Biscay. She returned to Madrid with her mother, Amalia Goyri, a seamstress of great character and culture. Due to her delicate health she was educated at home by her mother, who frequently gave her lessons outdoors in the Buen Retiro Park to help combat her tubercular arthritis.La primera mujer universitaria Española: María Goyri http://www.mujeryciencia.es/2010/10/25/la- primera-mujer-universitaria-espanola-maria-goyri/print/ Ignoring the conventions of the time she enrolled María in a gym and when she was twelve she began business courses at the Association for the Education of Women. There she discovered she enjoyed the study of grammar and in 1887 she enrolled in the School for Governesses to become a teacher. In 1890 she and another young student, Carmen Gallardo, audited classes in the School of Philosophy and Letters at the University of Madrid. In 1892 she received permission from the General Secretary of Public Instruction to register officially as a female student in order to attend classes on the condition that her presence not distract male students.Janet Pérez & Maureen Ihrie, The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature, (2002) https://books.google.com/books?id=thba9JxuDXAC&pg;=PA280&lpg;=PA280&dq;=maria+goyri&source;=bl&ots;=KDhrQyDwH&sig;=gIgomgFHbqasXyLaY491k9zh0QQ&hl;=en&ei;=tID9TNfDHIessApg4o3QBA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=10&ved;=OCDsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q;=maria%20goyri&f;=false Prior to each class she was not permitted to wait in the corridor and had to wait in an office adjacent to her classroom. Her professor would then escort her to her own individual desk near his. At the end of class she would be escorted out the same way. One of her professors was the foremost academic of the day, the Spanish scholar and historian, Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo. In her first year she heard Emilia Pardo Bazán's presentation of \\"The Education of Men & Women\\" in which she attacked Rosseau and François Fénelon as anti- feminist and defended John Stuart Mill and Gottfried Leibniz for their progressive advocacy of educational reforms for women. When Concepción Arenal's presentation of her views on women's duties and rights provoked violent attacks, María stood up and vehemently defended the elderly activist. María Goyri obtained the titles of normal school professor (1893), licentiate in philosophy and letters (1896), and Doctor of Philosophy and letters (1909). Marriage María met Ramón Menéndez Pidal when Menéndez Pelayo took her to hear his former student give a lecture at the Graduate School of the University. Ramón was now a university professor and had obtained the chair in Romance Philology. Finding they shared the same interests she became his student and then his assistant.http://www.segundarepublica.com/index.php?opcion=2&id;=48 They were married in 1900 and for their honeymoon they retraced the geographic locales of the Poem of the Cid (Poema de mío Cid), the oldest preserved Spanish epic poem.Penguin Classics, The Poem of the Cid: A Bilingual Edition with Parallel Text, Translated by Rita Hamilton, (1975) They had three children: Ramón, who died in childhood, Jimena and Gonzalo. María and Ramón devoted their lives to research on everything related to philology and the preservation of ancient Spanish history and ballads. She also collaborated with the Protectorado del Niño Delincuente (Child Delinquent Protectorate), an organization founded in 1916 to help prevent the incarceration of youths under the age of 16. When the Instituto Escuela de segunda enseñanza (High School Institute) was established in 1918 she taught language and literature.Janet Pérez & Maureen Ihrie, The Feminist Encyclopedia of Spanish Literature, (2002), p.280 On October 23, 1933 she was elected board member of the Patronato del Centro para Ampliación de Estudios (Board for Advanced Studies) and worked along with Blas Cabrera, Luis Calandre, María de Maeztu and Luis de Zulueta. She taught at the Institute of Free Education (Junta para Ampliación de Estudios) until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War combining physical exercise along with intellectual studies. Spanish Civil War María and Ramón were at their country house at San Rafael, a town nestled on the royal road linking Madrid to the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, when the Civil war broke out taking them completely by surprise. They were with their daughter Jimena, her husband, Miguel Catalán Sañudo and their son Diego Catalán in an area controlled by military who had risen against the Second Spanish Republic. After bombardment by planes from the Cuatro Vientos Airport they were forced to flee to El Espinar and later to Segovia for safety. The war was a catastrophe for Goyri. They were on the side of Francisco Franco but she still defended her liberal views including equal rights for women in all areas, especially education. In the Archivo General de la Guerra Civil Española (General Archive of the Spanish Civil War) is a report that was made up by the National Defense Council led by Franco. It reveals that the family members of Menéndez Pidal- Catalán and their circle of friends were being discreetly watched and their correspondence checked. The report sent to Burgos, the base of the Nationalist government, said that \\"Ramón Menéndez Pidal, Director of the Royal Spanish Academy, was weak of character and totally dominated by his wife, María Goyri, a cultured woman of great talent and extraordinary energy who has perverted her husband and children. She is very persuasive and one of the most dangerous people in Spain. Without doubt one of the more robust roots of the revolution.\\" After the war the Free Institute of Education and all schools under the auspices of the Board for Advanced Studies were banned and teachers forbidden to promote women's equality in education and other liberal causes. In addition to teaching María devoted her later years to research, gathering and archiving different versions of ancient oral ballads that are now kept in the Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal, a non-profit center dedicated to developing historical and philogical studies and humanistic research.Fundación Ramón Menéndez Pidal Located at the olive grove garden of Olivar de Chamartin in the north of Madrid it is an indispensable source for scholars and is today considered part of the \\"National Treasure\\" of Spain.

The Cholas united most of the south Indian peninsula under a single administration during the 10th and the 11th century CE. The region of Tamil Nadu or Tamilakam, in the southeast of modern India, shows evidence of having had continuous human habitation from 15,000 BCE to 10,000 BCE. Throughout its history, spanning the early Upper Paleolithic age to modern times, this region has coexisted with various external cultures. The three ancient Tamil dynasties namely Chera, Chola, and Pandya were of ancient origins. Together they ruled over this land with a unique culture and language, contributing to the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in the world. These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other vying for hegemony over the land. Invasion by the Kalabhras during the 3rd century disturbed the traditional order of the land, displacing the three ruling kingdoms. These occupiers were overthrown by the resurgence of the Pandyas and the Pallavas, who restored the traditional kingdoms. The Cholas who re-emerged from obscurity in the 9th century by defeating the Pallavas and the Pandyas rose to become a great power and extended their empire over the entire southern peninsula. At its height the Chola empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km² (1,389,968 sq mi) straddling the Bay of Bengal. The Chola navy held sway over the Sri Vijaya kingdom in Southeast Asia. Rapid changes in the political situation of the rest of India occurred due to incursions of Muslim armies from the northwest and the decline of the three ancient dynasties during the 14th century, The Madras Presidency, comprising most of southern India, was created in the 18th century and was ruled directly by the British. After the independence of India, after the Telugu and Malayalam parts of Madras state were separated from Tamilagam state in 1956, it was renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1968 by the state government.  Pre-historic period  = Palaeolithic = For most of the Lower Palaeolithic stage, pre-modern humans lived close to river valleys with sparse forest cover or in grassland environments. The population density was very low and so far only two localities of this lower Palaeolithic culture have been found in south India.Pappu et al., Antiquity vol 77 no 297, September 2003 Pre-modern humans in South India, belonging to the species of Homo erectus, lived in this primitive 'old stone age' (Palaeolithic) for quite a long time, using only crude implements such as hand axes and choppers and subsisting as hunter- gatherers.Tools of the Madras Industry have been found in the Kaveri and Vaigai beds —K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari, Advanced History of India, p. 14. In Attirampakkam, archaeologists from the Sharma Centre for Heritage Education excavated ancient stone tools which suggests that a humanlike population existed in the Tamil Nadu region somewhere around 300,000 years before homo sapiens arrived from Africa. A discovery of a rare fossilized baby brain in Viluppuram district, by a team of archaeologists was reported in April 2003, It is estimated to be about 187,000 years - 200,000 years or older.\\"Religions and Religious Freedom in India\\", page 20 The ancestor of modern humans (Homo sapiens) who appeared around 50,000 years ago was more developed and could make thinner flake tools and blade-like tools using a variety of stones. From about 10,000 years ago, humans made still smaller tools called Microlithic tools. The material used by the early humans to make these tools were jasper, agate, flint, quartz, etc. In 1949, researchers found such microliths in Tirunelveli district.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p. 45. Archaeological evidence suggests that the microlithic period lasted between 6000–3000 BCE.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p. 46. = Neolithic = In Tamil Nadu, the Neolithic period had its advent around 2500 BCE. Humans of the Neolithic period made their stone tools in finer shapes by grinding and polishing. A Neolithic axe head with ancient writing on it has been found in North Tamil Nadu Near Palar river. The Neolithic humans lived mostly on small flat hills or on the foothills in small, more or less permanent settlements but for periodical migration for grazing purposes. They gave the dead proper burials within urns or pits. They were also starting to use copper for making certain tools or weapons. = Iron Age = During the Iron Age humans started using iron for making tools and weapons. The Iron Age culture in peninsular India is marked by Megalithic burial sites, which are found in several hundreds of places.One such was found at Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu— On the bases of both some excavations and the typology of the burial monuments, it has been suggested that there was a gradual spread of the Iron Age sites from the north to the south. Comparative excavations carried out in Adichanallur in Thirunelveli District and in Northern India have provided evidence of a southward migration of the Megalithic culture.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India Tamilnadu is stated as Kalabhras, pp. 49–51 The earliest clear evidence of the presence of the megalithic urn burials are those dating from around 1800 BCE, which have been discovered at various places in Tamil Nadu, notably at Adichanallur, 24 km from Tirunelveli, where archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India unearthed 157 urns, including 15 containing human skulls, skeletons and bones, plus husks, grains of rice, charred rice and Neolithic Celts. One urn has writing inside, which, according to archaeologists from the Archaeological Survey of India, resembles early Tamil- Brahmi script, confirming it of the Neolithic period 2800 years ago.Subramanian T.S.

Mentions of the political situation of Tamil Nadu before the common era are found in Ashoka's edicts dated c.3rd century BCE and, vaguely, in the Hathigumpha inscription dated c.2nd century BCE. The earliest epigraphical evidence in the Tamil country are that of the Pandya king Kadungon (c. 560–590 CE) who displaced the Kalabhras from the Pandyas country. —Nilakanta Sastri, A history of South India, pp 105, 137  Early history  Ancient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called Vendhar and several tribal chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination Vel or Velir.K.A.N. Sashtri, A History of South India, pp 109–112 Still lower at the local level there were clan chiefs called kizhar or mannar.'There were three levels of redistribution corresponding to the three categories of chieftains, namely: the Ventar, Velir and Kilar in descending order. Ventar were the chieftains of the three major lineages, viz Cera, Cola and Pandya. Velir were mostly hill chieftains, while Kilar were the headmen of settlements...' — During the 3rd century BCE, the Deccan was part of the Maurya Empire, and from the middle of the 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE the same area was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty. The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires. The Tamil kings and chiefs were always in conflict with each other mostly over the property. The royal courts were mostly places of social gathering rather than places of dispensation of authority; they were centres for distribution of resources. Tamil literature Tolkappiyam sheds some light on early religion.Kanchan Sinha, Kartikeya in Indian art and literature, Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan (1979). Gradually the rulers came under the influence of Vedic beliefs, which encouraged performance of sacrifices to enhance the status of the ruler.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p 129 Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivika co-existed with early Shaivite, Vaishnavism and Shaktism during the first five centuries. The names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273–232 BCE) inscriptions, among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.'Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as Tamraparni...' —K.A.N. Sastri, The CōĻas, 1935 p 20 The king of Kalinga, Kharavela, who ruled around 150 BCE, mentioned in the famous Hathigumpha inscription of the confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms that had existed for over 100 years. Karikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Sangam poetry.Pattinappaalai, Porunaraatruppadai and a number of individual poems in Akananuru and Purananuru have been the main source for the information we attribute now to Karikala. See also K.A.N. Sastri, The Colas, 1935 In later times Karikala was the subject of many legends found in the Cilappatikaram and in inscriptions and literary works of the 11th and 12th centuries. They attribute to him the conquest of the whole of India up to the Himalayas and the construction of the flood banks of the river Kaveri with the aid of his feudatories.Cilappatikaram (c. 6th century CE) which attributes northern campaigns and conquests to all the three monarchs of the Tamil country, gives a glorious account of the northern expeditions of Karikala, which took him as far north as the Himalayas and gained for him the alliance and subjugation of the kings of Vajra, Magadha and Avanti countries. There is no contemporary evidence either in Sangam literature or from the north Indian source for such an expedition. These legends, however, are conspicuous by their absence in the Sangam poetry. Kocengannan was another famous early Chola king who has been extolled in a number of poems of the Sangam period. He was even made a Saiva saint during the medieval period. Pandyas ruled initially from Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula, and in later times moved to Madurai. Pandyas are also mentioned in Sangam Literature, as well as by Greek and Roman sources during this period. Megasthenes in his Indika mentions the Pandyan kingdom.In Megasthenes' account (350 BCE – 290 BCE), the Pandya kingdom is ruled by Pandaia, a daughter of Herakles —K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p 23 The Pandyas controlled the present districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli, and parts of south Kerala. They had trading contacts with Greece and Rome. With the other kingdoms of Tamilakam, they maintained trading contacts and marital relationships with Tamil merchants from Eelam. Various Pandya kings find mention in a number of poems in the Sangam literature. Among them, Nedunjeliyan, 'the victor of Talaiyalanganam' deserves a special mention. Besides several short poems found in the Akananuru and the Purananuru collections, there are two major works—Mathuraikkanci and the Netunalvatai (in the collection of Pattupattu) that give a glimpse into the society and commercial activities in the Pandyan kingdom during the Sangam age. The early Pandyas went into obscurity at the end of the 3rd century CE during the incursion of the Kalabhras. The kingdom of the Cheras comprised the modern Western Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along the western or Malabar Coast of southern India. Their proximity to the sea favoured trade with Africa.'Archaeologists from UCLA and the University of Delaware have unearthed the most extensive remains to date from sea trade between India and Egypt during the Roman Empire, adding to mounting evidence that spices and other exotic cargo travelled into Europe over sea as well as land.' Archaeological evidence for the maritime contact between the Sangam age Cheras and the Roman empire has been found at Karur, which was the capital of Cheras. —R. Nagasami, Roman Karur Chera rulers dated to the first few centuries AD. It records the names of the kings, the princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present, a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan Chera are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan Chera, the most celebrated Chera king, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the Tamil epic Silapathikaram. These early kingdoms sponsored the growth of some of the oldest extant literature in Tamil. The classical Tamil literature, referred to as Sangam literature is attributed to the period between 500 BCE and 300 CE.Kamil Veith Zvelebil, Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature, p 12K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, OUP (1955) p 105 The poems of Sangam literature, which deal with emotional and material topics, were categorised and collected into various anthologies during the medieval period. These Sangam poems paint the picture of a fertile land and of a people who were organised into various occupational groups. The governance of the land was through hereditary monarchies, although the sphere of the state's activities and the extent of the ruler's powers were limited through the adherence to the established order (dharma).K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, OUP (1955) pp 118, 119 The people were loyal to their kings and roving bards and musicians and danseuse gathered at the royal courts of the generous kings. The arts of music and dancing were highly developed and popular. Musical instruments of various types find mention in the Sangam poems. The amalgamation of the southern and the northern styles of dancing started during this period and is reflected fully in the epic Cilappatikaram.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, OUP (1955) p 124 Internal and external trade was well organised and active. Evidence from both archaeology and literature speaks of a flourishing foreign trade with the Yavanas (Greeks). The port city of Puhar on the east coast and Muziris on the west coast of south India were emporia of foreign trade, where huge ships moored, offloading precious merchandise.'The vast quantities of gold and silver coins struck by Roman emperors up to Nero (54–68CE) found all over Tamil Nadu testify the extent of the trade, the presence of Roman settlers in the Tamil country'. K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, OUP (1955) pp 125–127 This trade started to decline after the 2nd century CE and the direct contact between the Roman empire and the ancient Tamil country was replaced by trade with the Arabs and the Auxumites of East Africa. Internal trade was also brisk and goods were sold and bartered. Agriculture was the main profession of a vast majority of the populace.  Interregnum (300–700)  After the close of the Sangam era, from about 300 to about 600 CE, there is an almost total lack of information regarding occurrences in the Tamil land. Some time about 300 CE, the whole region was upset by the appearance of the Kalabhras. These people are described in later literature as 'evil rulers' who overthrew the established Tamil kings and got a stranglehold of the country.'Kalabhraas were denounced as 'evil kings' (Kaliararar) —K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p 130 information about their origin and details about their reign is scarce. They did not leave many artifacts or monuments. The only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in Buddhist and Jain literature.Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund, A History of India, Routledge (UK), p 105 Historians speculate that these people followed Buddhist or Jain faiths and were antagonistic towards the Hindu religions (viz. the Astika schools) adhered by the majority of inhabitants of the Tamil region during the early centuries CE.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India p 130 As a result, Hindu scholars and authors who followed their decline in the 7th and 8th century may have expunged any mention of them in their texts and generally tended to paint their rule in a negative light. It is perhaps due to this reason, the period of their rule is known as a 'Dark Age'—an interregnum. Some of the ruling families migrated northwards and found enclaves for themselves away from the Kalabhras.K.A.N. Sastri postulates that there was a live connection between the early Cholas and the Renandu Cholas of the Andhra country. The northward migration probably took place during the Pallava domination of Simhavishnu. Sastri also categorically rejects the claims that these were the descendants of Karikala Chola —K.A.N. Sastri, The CōĻas, 1935 p 107 Jainism and Buddhism, took deep roots in the society, giving birth to a large body of ethical poetry. Writing became very widespread and vatteluttu evolved from the Tamil-Brahmi became a mature script for writing Tamil. While several anthologies were compiled by collecting bardic poems of earlier centuries, some of the epic poems such as the Cilappatikaram and didactic works such as the Tirukkural were also written during this period.The identity of the author of Tirukkural is not known with any certainty. This work of 1330 distichs is attributed to Tiruvalluvar, who was probably a Jain with knowledge of the Sanskrit didactic works of the north. The patronage of the Jain and Buddhist scholars by the Kalabhra kings influenced the nature of the literature of the period, and most of the works that can be attributed to this period were written by the Jain and Buddhist authors. In the field of dance and music, the elite started patronising new polished styles, partly influenced by northern ideas, in the place of the folk styles. A few of the earliest rock-cut temples belong to this period. Brick temples (known as kottam, devakulam, and palli) dedicated to various deities are referred to in literary works. Kalabhras were displaced around the 7th century by the revival of Pallava and Pandya power.Pandya Kadungon and Pallava Simhavishnu overthrew the Kalabhras. Acchchutakalaba is likely the last Kalabhra king —K.A.N. Sastri, The CōĻas, 1935 p 102 Even with the exit of the Kalabhras, the Jain and Buddhist influence still remained in Tamil Nadu. The early Pandya and the Pallava kings were followers of these faiths. The Hindu reaction to this apparent decline of their religion was growing and reached its peak during the later part of the 7th century.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 382 There was a widespread Hindu revival during which a huge body of Saiva and Vaishnava literature was created. Many Saiva Nayanmars and Vaishnava Alvars provided a great stimulus to the growth of popular devotional literature. Karaikkal Ammaiyar who lived in the 6th century CE was the earliest of these Nayanmars. The celebrated Saiva hymnists Sundaramurthi, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Thirunavukkarasar were of this period. Vaishnava Alvars such as Poigai Alvar, Bhoothathalvar and Peyalvar produced devotional hymns for their faith and their songs were collected later into the four thousand poems of Naalayira Divyap Prabhandham.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 333–335  Age of empires (600–1300)  The medieval period of the history of the Tamil country saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms, some of whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas. The Cholas who were very active during the Sangam age were entirely absent during the first few centuries.K.A.N. Sastri, The CoLas, pp 102 The period started with the rivalry between the Pandyas and the Pallavas, which in turn caused the revival of the Cholas. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power. Their decline saw the brief resurgence of the Pandyas. This period was also that of the re-invigorated Hinduism during which temple building and religious literature were at their best.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India p 387 The Hindu sects Saivism and Vaishnavism became dominant, replacing the prevalence of Jainism and Buddhism of the previous era. Saivism was patronised more by the Chola kings and became more or less a state religion.There is an inscription from 1160 that the custodians of Siva temples who had social intercourses with Vaishnavites would forfeit their property. —K.A.N. Sastri, The CōĻas, 1935 pp 645 Some of the earliest temples that are still standing were built during this period by the Pallavas. The rock-cut temples in Mamallapuram and the majestic Kailasanatha and Vaikuntaperumal temples of Kanchipuram stand testament to the Pallava art. The Cholas, utilising their prodigious wealth earned through their extensive conquests, built long-lasting stone temples including the great Brihadisvara temple of Thanjavur and exquisite bronze sculptures. Temples dedicated to Siva and Vishnu received liberal donations of money, jewels, animals, and land, and thereby became powerful economic institutions.Some of the output of villages throughout the kingdom was given to temples that reinvested some of the wealth accumulated as loans to the settlements. The temple served as a centre for redistribution of wealth and contributed towards the integrity of the kingdom —John Keays, India a History, pp 217–218. Mutharaiyar who ruled the central part of Tamil Nadu between 600 - 900 CE. The Cauvery Delta regions were mostly ruled by the Muthraiyar Kings having Woraiyur as their Capital. Vijayalayachola conquered Tanjore from Dhancheya Muhuraiyar King who established the Tanjore City. Among the noted Muthariyar King, Perumbidugu alias Swaran Maran Muthraiyar who conquered consequently 14 battles and known as the Emperor in Tamil Nadu (Perarasar). He and his ancestors built many cave temples in Tiruchirappalli and Pudukottai regions. Among them Kuvavan Sathan alias Videl Vidugu Muthraiyar built many cave temples in Pudukottai Region. Mutharaiyars and ancestors are known as Muthuraja in central of part of Tamil Nadu particularly Tiruchirappalli. Reference : Mutharaiyar Dynasty wikipedia.org. Tamil script replaced the vatteluttu script throughout Tamil Nadu for writing Tamil. Religious literature flourished during the period. The Tamil epic, Kamban's Ramavatharam, was written in the 13th century. A contemporary of Kamban was the famous poet Auvaiyar who found great happiness in writing for young children. The secular literature was mostly court poetry devoted to the eulogy of the rulers. The religious poems of the previous period and the classical literature of the Sangam period were collected and systematised into several anthologies. Sanskrit was patronised by the priestly groups for religious rituals and other ceremonial purposes. Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of Rajaraja Chola I, collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called Tirumurais. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in Periyapuranam by Sekkilar, who lived during the reign of Kulothunga Chola II (1133–1150 CE). Jayamkondar's Kalingattupparani, a semi- historical account on the two invasions of Kalinga by Kulothunga Chola I was an early example of a biographical work.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 342–344 = Pallavas = Shore Temple in Mamallapuram built by the Pallavas. (c. eighth century CE) The 7th century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son Mamalla Narasimhavarman I. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 91–92 It has been widely accepted by scholars that they were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings.Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 A. D., pp 68 After the fall of the Satavahanas, they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country. Later they had marital ties with the Vishnukundina who ruled over the Deccan. It was around 550 CE under King Simhavishnu that the Pallavas emerged into prominence. They subjugated the Cholas and reigned as far south as the Kaveri River. The Pallavas were at their finest during the reigns of Narasimhavarman I and Pallavamalla Nandivarman II. Pallavas ruled a large portion of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Dravidian architecture during the Pallava rule includes the Shore Temple, built for Narasimhavarman II, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many sources describe Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen school of Buddhism in China, as a prince of the Pallava dynasty.Kamil V. Zvelebil (1987). \\"The Sound of the One Hand\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, p. 125-126. During the 6th and the 7th centuries, the western Deccan saw the rise of the Chalukyas based in Vatapi. Pulakeshin II (c.610–642) invaded the Pallava kingdom in the reign of Mahendravarman I. Narasimhavarman who succeeded Mahendravarman mounted a counter invasion of the Chalukya country and captured the Chalukyan capital Vatapi and ruled it for 12 years. The rivalry between the Chalukyas and the Pallavas continued for another 100 years until the demise of the Chalukyas around 750. The Chalukyas and Pallavas fought numerous battles and the Pallava capital Kanchipuram was occupied by Vikramaditya II during the reign of Nandivarman II.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 140 Nandivarman II had a very long reign (732–796). He led an expedition to the Ganga kingdom (south Mysore) in 760. Pallavas were also in constant conflict with the Pandyas and their frontier shifted along the river Kaveri. The Pallavas had the more difficult existence of the two as they had to fight on two fronts—against the Pandyas as wells as the Chalukyas. = Pandyas = Pandyan Empire Pandya Kadungon (560–590) is credited with the overthrow of the Kalabhras in the south. Kadungon and his son Maravarman Avanisulamani revived the Pandya power. Pandya Cendan extended their rule to the Chera country. His son Arikesari Parantaka Maravarman (c. 650–700) had a long and prosperous rule. He fought many battles and extended the Pandya power. Pandya was well known since ancient times, with contacts, even diplomatic, reaching the Roman Empire; during the 13th century, Marco Polo mentioned it as the richest empire in existence. The Pandyan Empire was large enough to pose a serious threat to the Pallava power. Pandya Maravarman Rajasimha aligned with the Chalukya Vikramaditya II and attacked the Pallava king Nandivarman II.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India p 140 Varagunan I defeated the Pallavas in a battle on the banks of the Kaveri. The Pallava king Nandivarman sought to restrain the growing power of the Pandyas and went into an alliance with the feudal chieftains of Kongu and Chera countries. The armies met in several battles and the Pandya forces scored decisive victories in them. Pandyas under Srimara Srivallaba also invaded Sri Lanka and devastated the northern provinces in 840.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India p 145 The Pandya power continued to grow under Srimara and encroached further into the Pallava territories. The Pallavas were now facing a new threat in the form of the Rashtrakutas who had replaced the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. However, the Pallavas found an able monarch in Nandivarman III, who with the help of his Ganga and Chola allies defeated Srimara at the Battle of Tellaru. The Pallava kingdom again extended up to the river Vaigai. The Pandyas suffered further defeats in the hands of the Pallava Nripatunga at Arisil (c. 848). From then the Pandyas had to accept the overlordship of the Pallavas.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 144–145 = Cholas = Around 850, out of obscurity rose Vijayalaya, made use of an opportunity arising out of a conflict between Pandyas and Pallavas, captured Thanjavur from Mutharaiyar dynasty and eventually established the imperial line of the medieval Cholas. Vijayalaya revived the Chola dynasty and his son Aditya I helped establish their independence. He invaded Pallava kingdom in 903 and killed the Pallava king Aparajita in battle, ending the Pallava reign.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India p 159 The Chola kingdom under Parantaka I expanded to cover the entire Pandya country. However, towards the end of his reign, he suffered several reverses by the Rashtrakutas who had extended their territories well into the Chola kingdom. Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola (c. 1030). The Cholas went into a temporary decline during the next few years due to weak kings, palace intrigues and succession disputes. Despite a number of attempts, the Pandya country could not be completely subdued and the Rashtrakutas were still a powerful enemy in the north. However, the Chola revival began with the accession of Rajaraja Chola I in 985. Cholas rose as a notable military, economic and cultural power in Asia under Rajaraja and his son Rajendra Chola I. The Chola territories stretched from the islands of Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the river Ganges in Bengal. Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed parts of Sri Lanka and occupied the islands of Maldives. Rajendra Chola extended the Chola conquests to the Malayan archipelago by defeating the Srivijaya kingdom.K.A.N. Sastri, The CoLas, 1935. pp 211–215 He defeated Mahipala, the king of Bihar and Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital called Gangaikonda Cholapuram (the town of Cholas who conquered the Ganges). At its peak, the Chola Empire extended from the island of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari basin in the north. The kingdoms along the east coast of India up to the river Ganges acknowledged Chola suzerainty. Chola navies invaded and conquered Srivijaya in the Malayan archipelago.The kadaram campaign is first mentioned in Rajendra's inscriptions dating from his 14th year. The name of the Srivijaya king was Sangrama Vijayatungavarman —K.A.N. Sastri, The CoLas, 1935 pp 211–220 Chola armies exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia.There is an inscription in the Chidambaram temple dated 1114 mentioning a peculiar stone presented by the king of Kambhoja (Kampuchea) to Rajendra Chola which the Chola king caused to be inserted into the wall of the Chidambaram shrine —K.A.N. Sastri, The CoLas, 1935 p 325 During the reign of Rajaraja and Rajendra, the administration of the Chola empire matured considerably. The empire was divided into a number of self-governing local government units, and the officials were selected through a system of popular elections.'In the twelfth year of Parantaka I the [Uttaramerur] sabha passed a resolution [...] that the election of local government officials will be carried out through lots (kudavolai)' —K.A.N. Sastri, The Colas, p 496. Brihadishwara Temple Throughout this period, the Cholas were constantly troubled by the ever-resilient Sinhalas trying to overthrow the Chola occupation of Lanka, Pandya princes trying to win independence for their traditional territories, and by the growing ambitions of the Chalukyas in the western Deccan. The history of this period was one of constant warfare between the Cholas and of these antagonists. A balance of power existed between the Chalukyas and the Cholas and there was a tacit acceptance of the Tungabhadra river as the boundary between the two empires. However, the bone of contention between these two powers was the growing Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom. The Cholas and Chalukyas fought many battles and both kingdoms were exhausted by the endless battles and a stalemate existed. Marital and political alliances between the Eastern Chalukya kings based around Vengi located on the south banks of the river Godavari began during the reign of Rajaraja following his invasion of Vengi. Virarajendra Chola's son Athirajendra Chola was assassinated in a civil disturbance in 1070 and Kulothunga Chola I ascended the Chola throne starting the Chalukya Chola dynasty. Kulothunga was a son of the Vengi king Rajaraja Narendra. The Chalukya Chola dynasty saw very capable rulers in Kulothunga Chola I and Vikrama Chola, however, the eventual decline of the Chola power practically started during this period. The Cholas lost control of the island of Lanka and were driven out by the revival of Sinhala power.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari, Advanced History of India, pp 294 Around 1118 they also lost the control of Vengi to Western Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI and Gangavadi (southern Mysore districts) to the growing power of Hoysala Vishnuvardhana, a Chalukya feudatory. In the Pandya territories, the lack of a controlling central administration caused a number of claimants to the Pandya throne to cause a civil war in which the Sinhalas and the Cholas were involved by proxy. During the last century of the Chola existence, a permanent Hoysala army was stationed in Kanchipuram to protect them from the growing influence of the Pandyas. Rajendra Chola III was the last Chola king. The Kadava chieftain Kopperunchinga I even captured Rajendra and held him prisoner. At the close of Rajendra's reign (1279), the Pandyan empire was at the height of prosperity and had completely absorbed the Chola kingdom.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari, Advanced History of India, pp 296–297 The Cholas also found a place in the very famous novel by Kalki title Ponniyin Selvan which portrays the whole Chola history with Rajaraja Cholan ( Ponniyin Selvan, Arul Mozhi Varman, Vallavarayan Vanthiyaththevan, Karikalar, Nandhini, Kundhavi) as the characters of the novel. = Cheras = The Cheras were an ancient Dravidian royal dynasty of Tamil origin who ruled in regions of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in India. Together with the Chola and the Pandyas, it formed the three principal warring Iron Age kingdoms of southern India in the early centuries of the Common Era. over a wide area comprising Venad, Kuttanad, Kudanad, Pazhinad, and more. In other words, they governed the area between Alappuzha in the south to Kasargod in the north. This included Palghat, Coimbatore, Salem, and Kollimalai. The capital was Vanchi, which the Romans who actively traded with the Cheras knew as Muzris. Chera Empire. By the early centuries of the Common Era, civil society and statehood under the Cheras were developed in present- day western Tamil Nadu. The location of the Chera capital is generally assumed to be at modern Karur (identified with the Korra of Ptolemy). The Chera kingdom later extended to the plains of Kerala, the Palghat gap, along the river Perar and occupied land between the river Perar and river Periyar, creating two harbour towns, Tondi (Tyndis) and Muciri (Muziris), where the Roman trade settlements flourished. The Cheras were in continuous conflict with the neighboring Cholas and Pandyas. The Cheras are said to have defeated the combined armies of the Pandyas and the Cholas and their ally states. They also made battles with the Kadambās of Banavasi and the Yavanas (the Greeks) on the Indian coast. After the 2nd century AD, the Cheras' power decayed rapidly with the decline of the lucrative trade with the Romans. The Tamil poetic collection called Sangam literature describes a long line of Chera rulers dated to the first few centuries AD. It records the names of the kings, the princes, and the court poets who extolled them. The internal chronology of this literature is still far from settled, and at present, a connected account of the history of the period cannot be derived. Uthiyan Cheralathan, Nedum Cheralathan and Senguttuvan Chera are some of the rulers referred to in the Sangam poems. Senguttuvan Chera, the most celebrated Chera king, is famous for the legends surrounding Kannagi, the heroine of the Tamil epic Silapathikaram. The Chera kingdom owed its importance to trade with West Asia, Greece, and Rome. Its geographical advantages, like the abundance of exotic spices, the navigability of the rivers connecting the Ghat mountains with the Arabian Sea, and the discovery of favorable Monsoon winds which carried sailing ships directly from the Arabian coast to Chera kingdom, combined to produce a veritable boom in the Chera foreign trade. The Later Cheras ruled from the 9th century. Little is known about the Cheras between the two dynasties. The second dynasty, Kulasekharas ruled from a city on the banks of River Periyar called Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur). Though never regained the old status in the Peninsula, Kulasekharas fought numerous wars with their powerful neighbors and diminished to history in the 12th century as a result of continuous Chola and Rashtrakuta invasions. The Chera Dynasty was supported by Tamil warriors such as Villavar, Vanavar and Malayar clans. The Chera rulers of Venadu, based at the port Quilon in southern Kerala, trace their relations back to the later/second Cheras. Ravi Varma Kulasekhara, ruler of Venadu from 1299 to 1314, is known for his ambitious military campaigns to former Pandya and Chola territories. = Pandya revival = After being overshadowed by the Pallavas and Cholas for centuries, the Pandiyas revived their fortunes in the 13th century and the Pandya power extended from the Telugu territories along the banks of the Godavari river to the northern half of Sri Lanka. When Kulasekara Pandyan I died in 1308, a conflict stemming from succession disputes arose amongst his sons – the legitimate Sundara Pandya and the illegitimate Vira Pandya (who was favoured by the king) fought each other for the throne. Soon Madurai fell into the hands of the invading armies of the Delhi Sultanate (which initially gave protection to the vanquished Sundara Pandyan). = Delhi Sultanate = Malik Kafur, a general of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khalji invaded and sacked Madurai in 1311.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 197 Pandyas and their descendants were confined to a small region around Thirunelveli for a few more years. Ravivarman Kulasekara (r. 1299–1314), a Chera (Perumal) feudatory of Kulasekara Pandya, staked his claim to the Pandya throne. Ravivarman, utilising the unsettled nature of the country, quickly overran the southern Tamil Nadu and brought the entire region from Kanyakumari to Kanchipuram, under the Chera kingdom. His inscription was found in Punaamalli, a suburb of Madras. But, Ravivarman's hold over Kānci was only short-lived and his aggressive activities were arrested by the Kākatiya ruler, Pratāparudra II. The Kākatiya army under the command of Muppidi Nāyaka marched to Kanci, and captured the city.History of Ancient India Rama Shankar Tripathi.

Some of the Martial Arts practiced by the Ancient Tamil People are: * Traditional Gymnastic Exercises (Mallarkhambam) * Burning Torch Games * Kuttu Varisai * Silambam * Vaazh Veechu - Sword Fight * Archery * Deer Horn Fight * Spring Sword Fight * Valari - Traditional South Indian Boomerang * Thigiri - Traditional South Indian Chakra Yuddham * Adimurai, today is commonly known as Southern Kalari or Thekkan Kalari. * Malyutham - Traditional Wrestling * Gusthi - Traditional Boxing * Urimaram Eruthal * Varma Kalai - The art of Vital Points  Vijayanagar and Nayak period (1300–1650)  Tirumalai Nayak Palace,Madurai The 14th-century invasion by the Delhi Sultans caused a retaliatory reaction from the Hindus, who rallied to build a new kingdom, called the Vijayanagara Empire. Bukka, with his brother Harihara, founded the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire based in the city of Vijayanagara in Karnataka.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 214–217 Under Bukka the empire prospered and continued to expand towards the south. Bukka and his son Kampana conquered most of the kingdoms of southern India. In 1371 the Vijayanagar empire defeated the short-lived Madurai Sultanate, which had been established by the remnants of the invading Khalji army.Kampana's wife Ganga Devi wrote an account of this campaign in a Sanskrit poem Madhura Vijayam (Conquest of Madurai) —K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 241 Eventually the empire covered the entire south India. Vijayanagara empire established local governors called Nayaks to rule in the various territories of the empire. Tanjore became a major cultural centre during the 18th and 19th centuries, under Maratha rule. The figure depicts a Tanjore painting from this era. From the collection of the V&A; Museum. The Vijayanagar Empire declined in 1564 defeated by the Deccan sultans in the Battle of Talikota.Rama Raya fought Ali Adil Shah at Talikota on 15 September 1564 —K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p 266 The local Nayak governors declared their independence and started their rule. The Nayaks of Madurai and Thanjavur were the most prominent of them. Ragunatha Nayak (1600–1645) was the greatest of the Tanjavur Nayaks.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari Advanced History of India p 428 Raghunatha Nayak encouraged trade and permitted a Danish settlement in 1620 at Tarangambadi.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari Advanced History of India p 427 This laid the foundation of future European involvement in the affairs of the country. The success of the Dutch inspired the English to seek trade with Thanjavur, which was to lead to far-reaching repercussions. Vijaya Raghava (1631–1676) was the last of the Thanjavur Nayaks. Nayaks reconstructed some of the oldest temples in the country and their contributions can be seen even today. Nayaks expanded the existing temples with large pillared halls, and tall gateway towers, which is representative of the religious architecture of this period. In Madurai, Thirumalai Nayak was the most famous Nayak ruler. He patronised art and architecture creating new structures and expanding the existing landmarks in and around Madurai. On Thirumalai Nayak's death in 1659, the Madurai Nayak kingdom began to break up. His successors were weak rulers and invasions of Madurai recommenced. Maratha influence Shivaji Bhonsle, the great Maratha ruler, invaded the south, as did Chikka Deva Raya of Mysore and other Muslim Rulers, resulting in chaos and instability. Rani Mangammal, the Nayak ruler of Madurai, resisted these invasions showing great courage.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari Advanced History of India p 553 Shivaji had conquered important forts like Gingee and Vellore by 1678. On the other hand, Ekoji, half brother of Shivaji had established his own rule in Thanjavur. Gingee served as the Maratha capital for nine years during the 27-year Mughal-Maratha war. The Mughals captured Gingee in 1698.  Rule of Poligars, Nizams and Nawabs  European settlements began to appear in the Tamil country during the Vijayanagara Empire. In 1605, the Dutch established trading posts in the Coromandel Coast near Gingee and in Pulicat. The British East India Company built a 'factory' (warehouse) at Armagaon (Durgarazpatnam), a village around North of Pulicat, as the site in 1626. In 1639, Francis Day, one of the officers of the company, secured the rights over a three-mile (5 km) long strip of land a fishing village called Madraspatnam from the Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, the Nayak of Vandavasi. The East India Company built Fort St George and castle on an approximate five square kilometre sand strip.John Keay, India, a History, p 370 This was the start of the town of Madras. The coromandel coast was ruled by the Vijayanagara King (Aravidu Dynasty), Peda Venkata Raya, based in Chandragiri and Vellore Fort. With his approval the English began to exercise sovereign rights over their strip of land.K.A.N. Sastri, Srinivasachari, Advanced History of India, p 583 During the Maratha rule of Thanjavur. After Ekoji, his three sons namely Shaji, Serfoji I, Thukkoji alias Thulaja I ruled Thanjavur. The greatest of the Maratha rulers was Serfoji II (1798–1832 ). Serfoji devoted his life to the pursuit of culture and Thanjavur became renowned as a seat of learning. Serfoji's patronised art and literature and built the Saraswati Mahal Library at his palace. The incursion of the Muslim armies from the north forced a southward migration of Hindus from the central Deccan and the Andhra countries to seek shelter under the Nayak and the Maratha kings. The famous Carnatic music composer Tyagaraja (1767–1847), along with the Trinity of Carnatic music flourished in the Thanjavur district during this time. Fort St. George, Chennai (18th century etching) With the demise of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, his empire dissolved amidst numerous succession wars and the vassals of the empire began to assert their independence. The administration of the southern districts of Tamil Nadu was fragmented with hundreds of Poligars or Palayakkarars governing a few villages each. These local chieftains often fought amongst each other over territory. This turned the political situation in the Tamil country and in South India in general into confusion and chaos. The European traders found themselves in a situation where they could exploit the prevailing confusion to their own advantage.John Keay, India, a History, pp 372–374  European colonisation (1750–1858)  = Anglo-French conflicts = Mohamed Ali Khan Wallajah, Nawab of the Carnatic (1717–1795) The French were relative newcomers to India. The French East India Company was formed in 1664 and in 1666 the French representatives obtained Aurangzeb's permission to trade in India. The French soon set up trading posts at Pondicherry on the Coromandel coast. They occupied Karaikal in 1739 and Joseph François Dupleix was appointed Governor of Pondichéry. In Europe the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740 and eventually the British and the French forces in India were caught up in the conflict. There were numerous naval battles between the two navies along the Coromandel coast. The French led by La Bourdonnais attacked the poorly defended Fort St. George in Madras in 1746 and occupied it. Robert Clive was one of the prisoners of war from this battle. The war in Europe ended in 1748 and with the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle Madras was restored to the British.John Keay, India, a History, pp 393–394 The conflict between the British and the French continued, this time in political rather than military terms. Both the Nawab of the Carnatic and Nizam of Hyderabad positions were taken by rulers who were strongly sympathetic to the French. Chanda Sahib had been made Nawab of the Carnatic with Dupleix's assistance, while the British had taken up the cause of the previous incumbent, Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah. In the resultant battle between the rivals, Clive assisted Mohammed Ali by attacking Chanda Sahib's fort in Arcot and took possession of it in 1751. The French assisted Chanda Sahib in his attempts to drive Clive out of Arcot. However, the large Arcot army assisted by the French was defeated by the British. The Treaty of Paris (1763) formally confirmed Mahommed Ali as the Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 the Emperor of Delhi issued a firman (decree) recognising the British possessions in southern India.John Keay, India, a History, p 379 = British Government control = Madras Presidency, 1909 Although the Company was becoming increasingly bold and ambitious in putting down resisting states, it was getting clearer day by day that the Company was incapable of governing the vast expanse of the captured territories. Opinion amongst the members of the British Parliament urged the government to control the activities of the Company. The Company's financial position was also bad and it had to apply for a loan from Parliament. Seizing this opportunity, the Parliament passed the Regulating Act (also known as East India Company Act) in 1773.Hermann Kulke, Dietmar Rothermund, A History of India pp 245 The act set down regulations to control the Company Board and created the position of the Governor General. Warren Hastings was appointed the first Governor-General. In 1784 Pitt's India Act made the Company subordinate to the British Government. The next few decades were of rapid growth and expansion in the territories controlled by the British. The Anglo-Mysore Wars of 1766 to 1799 and the Anglo-Maratha Wars of 1772 to 1818 put the Company in control of most of India.John Keay, India, a History, pp 380 In a sign of the early resistance against the English control, the Palayakkarar chieftains of the old Madurai Kingdom, who had independent authority over their territories, ran into a conflict with the Company officials over tax collection. Kattabomman, a local Palayakkarar chieftain in the Tirunelveli district, rebelled against the taxes imposed by the Company administration in the 1790s. After the First Polygar War (1799–1802), he was captured and hanged in 1799. A year later, the Second Polygar War was fought by Oomaithurai was involved in the Polygar Wars against the East India Company. In the first Poligar war, he was captured and imprisoned in Palayamkottai prison. In February 1801, he escaped from Palayamkottai and rebuilt the Panchalankurichi fort which had been razed in the first war. In the second Poligar war that followed, Oomaithurai allied himself with Maruthu brothers (who ruled Sivagangai) and was part of a grand alliance against the Company which included Dheeran Chinnamalai and Kerala Verma. The Company forces led by Lt. Colonel Agnew laid siege to the Panchalankurichi fort and captured it in May 1801 after a prolonged siege and artillery bombardment. Oomaithurai escaped the fall of the fort and joined Marudu brothers at their jungle fort at Kalayar Kovil. The Company forces pursued him there and eventually captured Kalayar Kovil in October 1801. Oomaithurai along with the Marudu brothers was hanged on 16 November 1801.Nicholas Dirk, The Hollow Crown, pp 19–24 In 1798 Lord Wellesley became the Governor-General. In the course of the next six years, Wellesley made vast conquests and doubled the Company's territory. He shut out the French from further acquisitions in India, destroyed several ruling powers in the Deccan and the Carnatic, took the Mughal Emperor under the company's protection and compelled Serfoji, the king of Thanjavur to cede control of his kingdom. The Madras Presidency was established so that the territory under direct Company control could be administered effectively. The direct administration began to cause resentment among the people. In 1806 the soldiers of the Vellore cantonment rebelled when William Bentinck, the Governor of Madras decreed that the native soldiers should abandon all caste marks. Fearing this act to be an attempt of forceful conversion to Christianity, the soldiers mutinied. The rebellion was suppressed but 114 British officers were killed and several hundred mutineers executed. Bentinck was recalled in disgrace.Read, Anthony, The Proudest Day—India's Long Ride to the Independence, pp 34–37 = End of Company rule = The simmering discontent in the various districts of the company territories exploded in 1857 into the Sepoy war. Although the rebellion had a huge impact on the state of the colonial power in India, Tamil Nadu was mostly unaffected by it. In consequence of the war, the British Government enacted the Act of 1858 to abolish the powers of the Company and transfer the government to the Crown.  British rule (1858-1947)  In 1858 the British Crown assumed direct rule in India. During the early years, the government was autocratic in many ways. The opinion of Indians in their own affairs was not considered by Britain as important. However, in due course, the British Raj began to allow Indians participation in local government. Viceroy Ripon passed a resolution in 1882, which gave a greater and more real share in local government to the people. Further legislation such as the 1892 Indian councils Act and the 1909 \\"Minto-Morley Reforms\\" eventually led to the establishment of the Madras Legislative Council. The non-cooperation movement started under Mahatma Gandhi's leadership led the British government to pass the Government of India Act (also known as Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms) of 1919. First elections were held for the local assemblies in 1921. Madras famine (1877). Distribution of relief. From the Illustrated London News (1877) Failure of the summer monsoons and administrative shortcomings of the Ryotwari system resulted in a severe famine in the Madras Presidency during 1876–1877.Romesh Chunder Dutt, Open Letters to Lord Curzon on Famines and Land Assessments in India, p10 The government and several charitable institutions organised relief work in the city and the suburbs. Funds were also raised from Europeans in India and overseas for the famine relief. Humanitarians such as William Digby wrote angrily about the woeful failure of the British administration to act promptly and adequately in response to the wholesale suffering caused by the famine. When the famine finally ended with the return of the monsoon in 1878, between three and five million people had perished. In response to the devastating effects of the famine, the government organised a Famine Commission in 1880 to define the principles of disaster relief. The government also instituted a famine insurance grant, setting aside 1.5 million Rupees. Other civic works such as canal building and improvements in roads and railway were also undertaken to minimise effects of any future famines. = Independence struggle = The growing desire for independence began to gradually gather pace in the country and its influence in Tamil Nadu generated a number of volunteers to the fight against the British colonial power in the struggle for Independence. Notable amongst these are Tiruppur Kumaran, who was born in 1904 in a small village near Erode. Kumaran lost his life during a protest march against the British. The location of the French colony of Pondichéry, offered a place of refuge for the fugitives freedom fighters trying to flee the British Police. Aurobindo was one such living in Pondicherry in 1910. The poet Subramanya Bharathi was a contemporary of Aurobindo. Bharathi wrote numerous poems in Tamil extolling the revolutionary cause. He also published the journal India from Pondicherry. Both Aurobindo and Bharathi were associated with other Tamil revolutionaries like V. O. Chidambaram Pillai. Tamils formed a significant percentage of the members of the Indian National Army (INA), founded by Subhas Chandra Bose to fight the British occupation in India.\\"Noting that the Tamils formed a large chunk of the strength of the INA, Prof. Pfaff, said it was always a moving experience to interact with the INA members from Tamil Nadu.\\" \\"More than 75 percent of the INA soldiers were Tamils\\" according to V. Vaidhyalingam, secretary and treasurer, Tamil Nadu Indian National Army League. Lakshmi Sahgal from Tamil Nadu was a prominent leader in the INA's Rani of Jhansi Regiment. In 1916 Dr. T.M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty released the Non-Brahmin Manifesto sowing the seeds for the Dravidian movements.Subramaniyam Swami, Is the Dravidian movement dying?, Frontline, Vol.20, Iss. 12, June 2003 During the 1920s, two movements focused mainly on regional politics began in Tamil Nadu. One was the Justice Party, which won the local legislative elections held in 1921. The Justice Party was not focused on the Indian independence movement, rather on the local issues such as affirmative action for socially backward groups. The other main movement was the anti-religious, anti-Brahmin reformist movement led by E.V. Ramasami Naicker. Further steps towards eventual self- rule were taken in 1935 when the British Government passed the All-India Federation Act of 1935. Fresh local elections were held and in Tamil Nadu the Congress party captured power defeating the Justice party. In 1938, Ramasami Naicker with C. N. Annadurai launched an agitation against the Congress ministry's decision to introduce the teaching of Hindi in schools.  Post Independence period  political state of Tamil Nadu in India was created in 1969 when erstwhile Madras State was renamed. The trauma of the partition did not impact Tamil Nadu when India was granted Independence in 1947. There was no sectarian violence against various religions. There had always been an atmosphere of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence between all religions in Tamil Nadu. Congress formed the first ministry in the Madras Presidency. C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) was the first Chief Minister. Madras Presidency was eventually reconstituted as Madras State. Following agitations for a separate Andhra state comprising the Telugu speaking regions of the Madras state by Potti Sriramalu, the Indian Government decided to partition the Madras state. In 1953 Rayalaseema and the coastal Andhra regions became the new state of Andhra Pradesh and the Bellary district became part of the Mysore state. In 1956 south Kanara district was transferred to Mysore, the Malabar coastal districts became part of the new state of Kerala, and the Madras state assumed its present shape. The Madras state was named Tamil Nadu (literally The Land of Tamils or Tamil Country) in 1969. The Sri Lankan Civil War during the 1970s and the 80s saw large numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing to Tamil Nadu. The plight of Tamil refugees caused a surge of support from most of the Tamil political parties.Rajesh Venugopal, The Global Dimensions of Conflict in Sri Lanka p 19 They exerted pressure on the Indian government to intercede with the Sri Lankan government on behalf of the Sri Lankan Tamilians. However, LTTE lost much of its support from Tamil Nadu following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on 21 May 1991 by an operative from Sri Lanka for the former prime minister's role in sending Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka to disarm the LTTE.Chris McDowell, A Tamil Asylum Diaspora, p112 The east coast of Tamil Nadu was one of the areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, during which almost 8000 people died in the disaster. The sixth most populous state in the Indian Union, Tamil Nadu was the seventh-largest economy in 2005 among the states of India. The growing demands for skilled labour has caused increased number of educational institutions in Tamil Nadu. The widespread application of caste based affirmative action caused the state to have 69% of all educational and employment vacancies to be reserved to the backward castes. Such caste-based reservations have huge public support in Tamil Nadu, with no popular protests organised against its implementation. = Evolution of regional politics = The politics of Tamil Nadu have gone through three distinct phases since independence. The domination of the Congress Party after 1947 gave way to the Dravidian populist mobilisation in the 1960s. This phase lasted until towards the end of the 1990s. The most recent phase saw the fragmentation of the Dravidian political parties and led to the advent of political alliances and coalition governments.John Harriss and Andrew Wyatt, THE CHANGING POLITICS OF TAMIL NADU IN THE 1990s, Conference on State Politics in India in the 1990s: Political Mobilisation and Political Competition, December 2004. p1 Annadurai formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949 after splitting from Dravidar Kazhagam.The Justice Party was renamed the Dravidar Kazhagam (Dravidian Association) in September 1944 —Nambi Arooran, K., The Demand for Dravida Nadu DMK also decided to oppose the 'expansion of the Hindi culture' in Tamil Nadu and started the demand for a separate homeland for the Dravidians in the South. The demand was for an Independent state called Dravida Nadu (country of Dravidians) comprising Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala.The geographical region of the proposed Dravida Nadu roughly corresponded to the then Madras Presidency, comprising people speaking Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. —S. Viswanathan, A history of agitational politics The increased involvement of the Indian National Congress party in Madras during the late 1950s and the strong pan- Indian emotions whipped up by the Chinese invasion of India in 1962 led to the demand for Dravida Nadu losing some of its immediacy. Consequently, in 1963, when the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of India, precluded secessionist parties from contesting elections, the DMK chose to formally drop its demand for an independent Dravida Nadu, focusing instead on securing greater functional autonomy within the framework of the Indian Constitution.Hargrave, R.L.: \\"The DMK and the Politics of Tamil Nationalism\\", Pacific Affairs, 37(4):396–411 at 396–397. The Congress party, riding on the wave of public support stemming from the independence struggle, formed the first post-independence government in Tamil Nadu and continued to govern until 1967. In 1965 and 1968, DMK led widespread anti-Hindi agitations in the state against the plans of the Union Government to introduce Hindi in the state schools. Affirmative action in employment and educational institutions were pioneered in Tamil Nadu based on the demands of the Dravidian movement.Cynthia Stephen, The History of Reservations in India From The 1800S to the 1950s The leadership of the Dravidian movement had very capable authors and literati in Annadurai and Karunanidhi, who assiduously utilised the popular media of stage plays and movies to spread its political messages.S. Theodore Baskaran, The Roots of South Indian Cinema, Journal of the International Institute, MG Ramachandran (MGR) who later became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, was one such stage and movie actor. In 1967 DMK won the state election. DMK split into two in 1971, with MGR forming the splinter All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). Since then these two parties have dominated the politics of Tamil Nadu.John Harriss and Andrew Wyatt, THE CHANGING POLITICS OF TAMIL NADU IN THE 1990s, Conference on State Politics in India in the 1990s: Political Mobilisation and Political Competition, December 2004. p2 AIADMK, under MGR, retained control of the State Government over three consecutive assembly elections in 1977, 1980 and 1984. After MGR's death, AIADMK was split over the succession between various contenders. Eventually J. Jayalalithaa took over the leadership of AIADMK. Several changes to the political balance in Tamil Nadu took place during the later half of the 1990s, eventually leading to the end of the duopoly of DMK and AIADMK in the politics of Tamil Nadu. In 1996, a split in the Congress party in Tamil Nadu eventuated in the formation of Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC). TMC aligned with the DMK, while another party Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), which split from DMK aligned with the AIADMK. These and several smaller political parties began to gain popular support. The first instance of a 'grand alliance' was during the 1996 elections for the National parliament, during which the AIADMK formed a large coalition of a number smaller parties to counter the electoral threat posed by the alliance between the DMK and TMC. Since then the formation of alliances of a large number of political parties has become an electoral practice in Tamil Nadu. The electoral decline of Congress party at the national level, which started during early 1990, forced the Congress to seek coalition partners from various states including Tamil Nadu. This paved the way for the Dravidian parties to be part of the Central Government.John Harriss and Andrew Wyatt, THE CHANGING POLITICS OF TAMIL NADU IN THE 1990s, Conference on State Politics in India in the 1990s: Political Mobilisation and Political Competition, December 2004. p4  See also  * Chronology of Tamil history * Tamil inscriptions * Tamizhi * Tamil Heritage Foundation * The Tamils are an ancient people... * Political history of medieval Karnataka  Notes   References                    * Further reading * Unintended influence of Jainism on the development of caste in post-classical Tamil society * ","title":"History of Tamil Nadu"},{"id":"5057295","text":"The Cedar Run District is a high school conference in the state of Virginia that includes schools stretching from Prince William County. Facts about the district The Cedar Run District was established in 2001 to serve two purposes. The first was to alleviate crowding in the Cardinal District, and the second purpose was to be a fourth district in the Northwestern Region, after two Southwest Virginia AAA Districts were consolidated into the Western Valley District. District history The charter members of the Cedar Run were Osbourn, Osbourn Park, Potomac, and Stonewall Jackson which all split from the Cardinal District. As Prince William County grew, Battlefield High School of Haymarket opened and joined the district in 2004. In 2005, Potomac was moved back to the Cardinal District, but the Cedar Run accepted Culpeper County High School from the Commonwealth District and Fauquier High School of the AA Northwestern District which expanded the district's geography considerably. In 2007, the Cedar Run District welcomed two more members, Liberty High School of Fauquier County from the AA Northwestern District, and Loudoun Valley High School of the AAA National District. In 2009-2010, Liberty High School, Fauquier High School, and Culpeper County High School will all move down to AA because of new schools opening up in their respective areas. A preliminary plan had two additional Loudoun County schools joining the district with Heritage High School of Leesburg coming from Group AA, and Stone Bridge High School of Ashburn coming from the Liberty District and AAA Northern Region. In addition, Osbourn Park is also expected to move back to the Cardinal District. However the preliminary plan was not passed and Stone Bridge was granted the right to stay in the Northern Region, Liberty District. Starting in the 2009/2010 school year the Cedar Run only had five members; Heritage, Loudoun Valley, Battlefield, Stonewall Jackson, and Osbourn. The smallest member is Heritage with an enrollment of about 1,900 students and the largest is Battlefield with an enrollment of about 3,700.

Biography Alexander Martin Sullivan, the second son of Daniel Sullivan of Dublin, was born in 1829 (A popular date for Sullivan's birth appears in many histories as 1830, but his grave-stone reads 1829) at Bantry, County Cork, the second of six sons. He was educated in the local national school. One of Sullivan's brothers was Timothy Daniel Sullivan, the Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1886–88. During the great famine of 1846–7 Sullivan was employed as a clerk in connection with the relief works started by the government. Deeply influenced by the distress he then witnessed, he afterwards joined the Confederate Club formed at Bantry in support of the revolutionary movement of the Young Irelanders, and was the organiser of the enthusiastic reception given by the town to William Smith O'Brien in July 1848 during the insurgent leader's tour of the southern counties. Early in 1853 Sullivan went to Dublin to seek employment as an artist. An exhibition of the arts and industries of Ireland was held in Dublin that year, and he was engaged to supply pencil sketches to the Dublin Expositor, a journal issued in connection with the exhibition. Subsequently, he obtained a post as draughtsman in the Irish valuation office, and afterwards as reporter on the Liverpool Daily Post. In 1850, Sullivan became assistant-editor of The Nation in 1855, and subsequently editor and proprietor. From 1861 to 1884, in conjunction with his elder brother, T. D. Sullivan, he made The Nation one of the most potent factors in the Irish Nationalist cause, and also issued the Weekly News and Zozimus. Called to the Irish bar in 1876, he was made Q.C. in 1881. At the 1874 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Louth, but although he did not formally resign, he did not take his seat. At the general election in April 1880, Sullivan was again returned for Louth, but this time formally resigned from the Commons on 18 May 1880. However, Charles Stewart Parnell had been elected for both Cork City and for Meath, and chose to sit for Cork. At the resulting by-election on 20 May 1880, Sullivan was returned unopposed to fill the vacancy in Meath, and held that seat until his resignation on 3 February 1882. As a member of the Dublin Corporation he secured a magnificent site for the Grattan Monument, towards which he donated £400, the amount of a subscription by his admirers while he was undergoing imprisonment for a political offence in 1868. This monument was formally unveiled in January 1876. Between 1878 and 1882 he was engaged in many notable trials. His last great case was on 30 November 1883 when he was colleague of Lord Russell in the defence of Patrick O'Donnell for the murder of James Carey, an informer. He was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. In addition to his labours Alexander Sullivan was a great temperance reformer. He also wrote two notable books, The Story of Ireland and New Ireland and contributed many sketches (including some verse) to Irish Penny Readings (1879–85). He died at Dartry Lodge, Rathmines, Dublin on 17 October 1884. Family Sullivan married Frances Genevieve Donovan and had several children. His second son and namesake, Alexander, was a leading barrister, the last to hold the rank of Serjeant-at-law (Ireland). He is remembered chiefly for his unsuccessful defence of Roger Casement on charges of treason.

The Law is for All is a collection of Aleister Crowley's commentary on The Book of the Law, the central sacred text of Thelema. It was edited to be a primer of sorts into Crowley's general interpretations about the sometimes opaque text of Liber Legis. For this reason, the book omits many of the more complex qabalistic explanations that lean heavily on an understanding of gematria and The Tree of Life. As the original editor, Louis Wilkinson, wrote in his introduction (p. 17): > The aim of the Commentary on the Book of the Law is to guide the reader > along the path of the discovery of his own true will, in accordance with > which, and only in accordance with which, he can rightly think and act. This > is why \\"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\\" Only by doing so > will you be shown your own true thought and life. Crowley's long expository was written prior to the final Comment that now is appended to The Book of the Law. Provenance Most of Crowley's commentaries were written between 1919 and 1922, and were edited by a trusted friend, Louis Wilkinson, at Crowley's request. A first draft was completed in 1946, and it is believed that Crowley reviewed it, since a copy was found among his final possessions; however, his death in 1947 put a hold on its publication. The original manuscript was eventually published under the name Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on the Book of the Law, edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant. The next year, Israel Regardie published a competing edition based on a 1926 manuscript. Both editions were cumbersome and neglected to address numerous inconsistencies within the complex collection of notes. The 1996 \\"popular edition\\" of The Law is for All was edited by Hymenaeus Beta based upon the final Wilkinson manuscript. Editions *Thelema Media, 1996.

The alliance was formed to combat the power of the Austro-Spanish alliance founded at the Peace of Vienna months earlier in May 1725.Knapton, J.J. & P. (1732).

University of Toronto. pp 158-186 The United Provinces and the Kingdom of Sweden later acceded to the Hanoverian Alliance through the Treaties of The Hague (1726) and Stockholm (1727). The Kingdom of Denmark- Norway did not formally join the Hanoverian Alliance, but did sign the Treaty of Copenhagen with Great Britain and France in April 1727. In 1728, Prussia would ally themselves with Emperor Charles VI and the Viennese Alliance by signing the secret Treaty of Berlin.  Principal Conditions  = Alliance Provisions =  Reasoning and Formation of the Hanoverian Alliance  The Spanish, who was an ally and close friend of the Habsburg Monarchy following the succession of Charles I (V) to the Spanish throne in 1516, broke their partnership with the Austrians in 1700. This was due to the death of Charles II, the last Habsburg Monarch of Spain, who died without issue. King Charles II appointed Philip d'Bourbon, Duke of Anjou as his successor. The following succession crisis sparked the War of the Spanish Succession (1700-1714), and consequently ended the two century alliance between Spain. After the defeat of the Spanish in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1717-1720), the Austrians decided to ally the Spanish once again in order to reset the balance of power in Europe; which had leaned towards France in recent years. King George I had also become wary of a renewed hegemony of Europe by Spain and the Empire. The Treaty of Hanover marks the beginning of the Hanoverian Alliance as a formal opposition to the renewed Austro-Spanish alliance (which would later be joined by the Russian Empire, and the Electorates of Bavaria and Cologne in 1726). Separate reassurances of full military support were also given in the event of the Holy Roman Empire attacking the French unexpectedly. > \\"There shall be now, and in all Time coming, a true, firm, and inviolable > Peace, the most sincere and intimate Friendship, and the most strict > Alliance and Union between the said three most serene Kings, their Heirs and > Successors...and prevent and repel all Wrongs and Damages, by the most > proper means they can find out.\\" Stately Quadrille. The members of the Viennese Alliance are in blue, the Hanoverian Alliance in red, and the Austro-Prussian Alliance in grey.  Military and Naval Support  It was agreed among the signers that approximate amounts of troops and cavalry would be supplied immediately in support if an enemy were to declare war. Great Britain and France would both send eight thousand troops and four thousand cavalry, while Prussia would send only three thousand troops and two thousand cavalry. Naval support was also guaranteed if needed. = Separate Article =  City of Thorn  In 1714, a religious massacre occurred in Royal Prussia called the Tumult of Thorn Religious tensions had been present in the city since the Jesuits entered into Thorn due to Poland-Lithuania's acceptance of the Counter- Reformation in 1595. After the Treaty of Oliva in 1660, religious tolerance was enforced in Royal Prussia; the city had become about half Catholic and half Lutheran. On 16 and 17 March 1726, the Jesuits were celebrating the feast day of Corpus Christi when Jesuit student of a monastery complained that Lutherans who were watching the procession did not take off their hats or kneel before the statue of Mary. Fights on both sides ensued, and a Jesuit monastery was damaged. Lutheran executions in the Thorn town square. Jesuits were badly beaten, portraits of Catholic saints were destroyed, and part of the altar was damaged. The Lutherans also gathered a pile of Catholic books and paintings, which were set on fire outside the monastery. After these events, the Jesuits sued the City in the Polish Supreme Court in Warsaw. The court, directed by King Augustus II, issued a verdict where thirteen Lutherans were set to be executed. Great Britain and Prussia, who both guaranteed the Treaty of Oliva, were greatly concerned with this massacre. The Polish court's verdict revealed religious intolerance present in Poland towards its Lutheran population, which both powers believed needed to be corrected and damaged Poland's international reputation. Prussia and Great Britain agreed to concert efforts towards Poland to enforce tolerance in the area.

KRDX broadcasts on the frequency of 98.5 MHz and is licensed to broadcast from Vail, Arizona (a southeastern suburb of Tucson). Due to the station's ERP of 3,900 watts and first adjacent channel to Hot 98.3 (KOHT), interference problems can be heard in the northwestern parts of Tucson as well as sporadically through Tucson. History KAYN began operating in 1977 as the first FM radio station in Nogales, Arizona. It was owned by Norman and Eva Graham and broadcast with 215 watts ERP on 98.3 MHz. The construction permit was granted over the objections of KFBR, the only other American radio station serving the area. The station was sold to Roadrunner Broadcasting in 1988; KZLZ Broadcasting bought the station, by then known as KLCR, in 1994. In 1999, after two additional sales, Ted Tucker bought KZNO. In April 2002, Tucker was approved to move KZNO from 98.3 in Nogales to 98.5 in Vail, increasing its ERP to 3.9 kW. According to a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing in 2006,http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getattachment_exh.cgi?exhibit_id=414003 the station had been unable to maintain a reliable power supply, as the only access to the transmitter site is via helicopter, and the station is powered solely by solar panels and wind turbines. The filing with the FCC to operate at less than licensed power or erratically based on power availability was accepted by the FCC, but not approved. In June 2010 KRDX was granted an FCC construction permit to change the city of license to Corona de Tucson, Arizona and move to 103.7, which should end its long-time interference with KOHT. This station is now available on 103.7, although 98.5 remains available as well. 103.7 now has a much more consistent signal throughout all of Tucson.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by architect Herbert Tullgren in Classical Revival style, the Astor Hotel was built in 1920 by developer Oscar Brachman for hotel tycoon Walter Schroeder. The building was originally U-shaped in plan, but an L-shaped addition in 1925 made the building into the E-shape seen today. The building has eight floors and stands 102 feet (31 m) tall.  History  When the Astor on the Lake opened it was considered one of the finest Midwest hotels of the time. It offered 125 guest rooms with a monthly rent of $100 to $300 depending on size. The façade is covered with gray limestone and has French Classical details and was constructed using steel-reinforced concrete. A stained glass skylight hangs above the reception area. Many of the rooms, which are now owner-occupied, were of simpler design. With Fire At dawn on February 18, 1935, the Astor Hotel caught fire. The fire was caused by electrical wires in the basement and a dense, oily smoke filled the building. The fire claimed the lives of two adults and two infants. Oscar Teweles, 59, and his nurse, Elsie Saxinger, 40, were killed due to suffocation in his apartment on the fifth floor. Over 300 people had to be evacuated due to the fire and were sent into the city streets. The damage caused by the fire was estimated at $75,000.

She owns Brandy Johnson's Global Gymnastics in Clermont, Florida. A member of Brown's Gymnastics club in Orlando, Florida, Johnson made an impressive debut in high-level competition, winning the all-around, vault, floor exercise and balance beam titles at the 1986 Junior Olympics National Championships. The following year, in her first US National Championships, Johnson won the all- around gold medal in the junior division. She also received her first international assignment, the Chunichi Cup in Japan, where she achieved a twelfth-place finish. During the buildup to the 1988 Olympics, Johnson moved to Houston, Texas, to be coached by Marta and Béla Károlyi. She placed sixth at the 1988 US Nationals and fourth at the Olympic Trials, securing a berth on the US team for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. At the Olympics, Johnson's tenth- place all-around finish was the highest for an American gymnast in the meet. She qualified for an event final on the vault, for which she placed fifth (however, had the competition been held under the New Life rule as in 1989, she would have won the silver medal). She, Kelly Garrison-Steves, and Phoebe Mills were the only U.S. women to qualify for an individual event final. Johnson opted to continue competing in 1989, returning to Brown's. It was a successful year for her, as she nearly swept the US National Championships, winning the all-around title and every event final, with the sole exception of uneven bars. She also achieved outstanding results as a member of the fourth- place US team at the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, coming in second on the vault and seventh in the all-around. Her AA placement was, at the time, the highest ever achieved by an American woman at Worlds. Her silver medal was the only one for an American gymnast in the competition. For her contributions to gymnastics in 1989, Johnson was nominated for the James E. Sullivan Award. Johnson competed well in 1990, placing third in the all-around and winning vault and floor gold at the US Nationals and winning the Olympic Festival AA. She placed 5th AA in the 1990 World cup and was an event finalist on bars, beam, and floor. However, it also marked her last year of elite competition. Johnson did not qualify for the 1990 Goodwill Games, and refused when USGF asked her to attend as an alternate. When Erica Stokes was unable to compete after sustaining an injury, the USGF asked Johnson to replace her. Johnson refused a second time because she was about to have surgery to remove a screw in one of her toes from a prior injury. The USGF has said that Johnson accused her former coach Bela Károlyi of concealing Stokes' injury to keep Johnson out of the competition. After retiring from elite gymnastics in 1990, Johnson worked for several years as a stunt double in Hollywood movies, including Bean, the film adaptation of the British television comedy Mr. Bean. She is now married, has one child (her daughter Sydney, who also competes in gymnastics), and is the owner of Brandy Johnson's Global Gymnastics in Clermont, Florida. Johnson also remains involved in the sport as a judge. In 2000, she was inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

Olive Rush, from a 1912 publication. Olive Rush (June 10, 1873 near Fairmount, Indiana – August 20, 1966 in Santa Fe, New Mexico) was a painter, illustrator, muralist, and an important pioneer in Native American art education. Today her paintings are held in a number of private collections and museums, including the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art.  Early Life  Rush kept diaries at the age of 13 in 1886, writing about her life, school lessons, and going sledding in Indiana winters. Part of the entires include working on a dialogue for class, going to lectures (\\"although it took some crying on my part\\"), and chores such as washing. Education Raised as a Quaker, Olive Rush studied at Earlham College, the art school associated with the Corcoran Gallery of Art and at the Art Students League before becoming an illustrator in New York. She was well known for her portraits and paintings of children and women, many of which were featured in magazines such as Woman's Home Companion and St. Nicholas. In 1904 she moved to Wilmington, Delaware, to study with Howard Pyle, and she stayed until 1910. She spent the next year in Europe studying British and French painters, and finished her art education at the Boston Museum School in 1912. In 1913 Rush returned to Europe with her friend, the watercolorist Alice Schille, visiting Belgium and France. Career In 1914 Rush, with her father, visited New Mexico and Arizona, and she had a one-person exhibition at the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe. She made several visits to New Mexico over the next couple of years and moved permanently to Santa Fe in 1920. Despite the relative isolation of Santa Fe, Rush continued to contribute to national and international shows over the next thirty years, which activity culminated in a retrospective at the Museum of New Mexico Art Gallery in 1957. Her former studio on Canyon Road in Santa Fe is now the home to the Santa Fe Quaker Meeting, as well as having guest house facilities available on the site. Rush considered her major influences to be early Chinese art, Japanese art, and El Greco. She was also inspired by the colorful style of Hopi and other Puebloan artists of the 1930s and 1940s. Murals Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The murals were intended to boost the morale of the American people from the effects of the Depression by depicting uplifting subjects.Rediscovering the People's Art: New Deal Murals in Pennsylvania’s Post Offices\\".

Almost 850 artists were commissioned to paint 1371 murals, most of which were installed in post offices, libraries, and other public buildings.University of Central Arkansas. \\"Arkansas Post Office Murals\\". 162 of the artists were women. The murals were funded as a part of the cost of the construction with 1% of the cost set aside for artistic enhancements. Olive Rush was commissioned by the Section of Fine Arts to complete painted murals for several public buildings in the American West. In Santa Fe, New Mexico she completed The Library Reaches the People, a fresco at the public library (now part of the New Mexico History Museum), as well as at the hotel La Fonda. In Pawhuska, Oklahoma she completed an oil on canvas mural, Osage Treaties for the post office. In Florence, Colorado she painted Antelope for the post office. Lastly, she completed two frescos, Cotton Industry and Farming and Natural History of Plant and Animal Life for the Foster Hall Biology Building at New Mexico State University. Also, her mural for the Maisel's Trading Post on Central in Albuquerque is still in place. She taught mural painting to students at the Santa Fe Indian School, which is now the Institute of American Indian Arts.

Earlscourt was originally settled by British immigrants in 1906, and was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1910. By the 1970s, Italian immigrants from Little Italy on College Street, moved northward to St. Clair Avenue.

The Western Valley District schools competed in the AAA Northwest Region with the schools from the AAA Cardinal District, the AAA Cedar Run District, and the AAA Commonwealth District. In the 2013-2014 school year, the schools of the Western Valley District were assigned to the previously Group AA based AA River Ridge District, AA Blue Ridge District, and AA Piedmont District. In the post-season, each school will compete against members of the same group classification only. History The Western Valley District was established in 2001 to consolidate the now defunct AAA Roanoke Valley District and the AAA Western District. The two districts' memberships had dwindled to five and four members respectively. Many schools in these districts had either lost student population or had experienced slow growth compared to the rest of Virginia, which made them eligible to drop to Group AA. In 2001, two of the five members of the Roanoke Valley district dropped to the AA Blue Ridge District, prompting the consolidation with the Western district. Below is a list of the Roanoke Valley and Western Districts in the 2000-2001 school year, and their districts for the 2001-2002 school year: AAA Roanoke Valley District *Cave Spring (AAA Western Valley) *William Fleming (AA Blue Ridge) *Franklin County (AAA Western Valley) *Patrick Henry (AAA Western Valley) *Pulaski County (AA Blue Ridge) AAA Western District *Albemarle (AAA Commonwealth) *E.C. Glass (AAA Western Valley) *Halifax County (AAA Western Valley) *George Washington (AAA Western Valley) Cave Spring's student body was split to form Hidden Valley High School (Roanoke, Virginia) in 2002. Both schools joined AA for the 2003-2004 school year, which reduced the district to five members. In 2007, William Fleming of Roanoke returned to the district because of increased enrollment, reuniting it with cross-town rival Patrick Henry. Travel concerns have been a major issue for schools in this district, as most other AAA schools are several hours away by driving. In football, where more points are earned for defeating AAA opponents than AA or A opponents, district members have had difficulty earning playoff spots and home field advantage. This problem has been lessened by having several schools play the other district schools twice during the season, with the second game counting in the district standings. The first game doesn't count in district standings but offers more playoff points than playing smaller local rivals.

It is used to stratify responsibility in most training programs and to determine salary. The grade of the resident is denoted with a numeral after the PGY designation, such as PGY-3 for a third-year resident. The length of residency depends mostly on the field a graduate chooses to take. Medical specialties such as family medicine and internal medicine often requires three years, whereas surgery usually requires a minimum of five, and neurological surgery is the longest at seven years. Subspecialization (vascular or orthopedic spine surgery as a branch of surgery, for example) in any field will add time to postgraduate training. For more information on specific medical residency programs, see the American Medical Association's Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database. Dental residencies for general practice, known as GPRs, are generally one year, with a possibility of a second year at some facilities. Dental specialties, such as orthodontics, require 2–4 years, while oral and maxillofacial surgery requires 4–6 years. Some specialty programs require that applicants have completed at least a one-year GPR residency, while other programs require applicants to have some private practice experience as a general dentist. Regardless of requirements, completing a GPR residency will make an applicant more competitive for any specialty program. Medical physics residencies range between two and four years, with at least two years fulfilling the necessary clinical experience. Completion of a CAMPEP- accredited residency allows one to sit for board examinations administered through the American Board of Radiology. PGY-3, and/or if also available -4, generally consist of scholarly research years, akin to a postdoctoral research position. Residencies options are either radiation oncology physics or medical imaging. Pharmacy residencies are usually one year, but a PGY-2 can be completed, often as an option, for pharmacy specialties such as critical care, cardiology, oncology, etc. In some teaching institutions, trainees are required to indicate level of training on all signatures (John Doe, M.D., PGY-1 or R-1; or John Doe, D.O., PGY-1 or R-1). Residencies are also offered for those in the physician assistant profession in a variety of specialties such as surgery and emergency medicine. Internships and residencies are also offered for those who have completed graduate education in psychology, known as interns and post-doc fellows.

In 1984, Atari, Inc. moved Typo Attack into its official line as a cartridge. After writing Typo Attack, Buehler had two action games published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1983: Wyzle! and Impact. Gameplay The game takes place on a single screen, divided up into multiple columns. At the bottom of each column is a letter or punctuation symbol and various enemies appear randomly at the top of the columns. Players must press the corresponding letter in a column in order to make the letter fire at the advancing enemies. If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen they will remove part of the shield around the letter, and if it is eaten away completely the player will lose a life. Depending on the level, the letters assigned to each column will change at irregular intervals.

Personal life Born in Chillán to Jewish immigrants (Ukrainian Moisés Teitelboim and Bessarabian Sara Volosky), Teitelboim was interested in literature from an early age. He finished high school, then began his studies in the Faculty of Law of the University of Chile, where at graduation he presented his senior thesis “The Dawn of Capitalism - The Conquest of America.”Teitelboim, Volodia (1943). El amanecer del capitalismo. La conquista de América . At the age of 29, Teitelboim married Raquel Weitzmann, who had also studied law. In the 1940s, while Teitelboim, like other members of the Communist Party, was forced to go underground, Weitzman became pregnant with the child of a former university colleague. The child, named Claudio, was adopted by Teitelboim and Weitzman's affair was hushed up. Due to Teitelmboim's frequent long periods of absence due to party activities, persecution, and imprisonment, the marriage suffered, and finally ended in 1957, when Weitzman left for Cuba in company of Jaime Barros.\\"Los hijos de Volodia\\", La Nación online, 2 Feb. 2008. Teitelboim then took charge of Claudio, who was 10 years old at the time. When, in 2005, Claudio learned that he had been deceived and that his father was actually the lawyer Álvaro Bunster, he broke relations with Teitelboim and took on his biological father's surname.\\"Volodia Teitelboim se confesó \\"triste\\" y \\"resignado\\" por la postura de Claudio Bunster\\", Cooperativa online, 24 Oct. 2005 (Accessed 28 Nov. 2013)\\"Claudio Bunster no asistirá a funeral de Volodia Teitelboim\\", El Mercurio online, 1 Feb. 2008 (Accessed 28 Nov. 2013) Teitelboim's second marriage, at the age of 51, was to Eliana Farías. Together, while in exile in Moscow following the Chilean military coup d'état of September 11, 1973, they raised Faría's son, Roberto Nordenflycht, and their own daughter, whom they named Marina. Roberto followed Teitlboim's example and also became a communist. He was killed in August 1989 while taking part in a guerrilla action in Chile with the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front. The grief over Roberto's death marked the end of Teitelboim's marriage to Farías. Marina, for her part, eventually became a career diplomat. Teitelboim died on January 31, 2008, at the Catholic University's hospital in Santiago of kidney failure resulting from lymphatic cancer. He and Claudio Bunster reportedly reconciled at the end. Political career Teitelboim joined the Chilean Communist Party's youth section at the age of sixteen. During the 1940s he endured persecution, along with all the militants of the Communist Party, and was imprisoned in Pisagua under the so-called Democratic Defense Law (also known as Ley maldita, or \\"cursed law\\"). In 1961 he was elected to Congress as a Deputy for Valparaíso and Quillota, a post he held until 1965, when he was elected Senator for Santiago. He was re-elected to this post in March 1973, but was only able to further serve in it until Congress was disbanded following the September 11, 1973, coup d'état.Reseňa biográfica parlamentaria: Volodia Teitelboim Volosky, at Historia Política Legislativa del Congreso Nacional de Chile website (Accessed 27 Nov. 2013) During the military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet Teitelboim lived in exile in Moscow, where he launched the twice-weekly radio program Escucha, Chile (\\"Listen, Chile\\").Teiteilboim, Encyclopædia Britannica online (Accessed 27 Nov. 2013) Despite the risk, he clandestinely returned to Chile in 1988Teteilboim, Stalwart of the Chilean Communist Party, Friend of Allende and Award-Winning Writer, The Guardian online, 13 Feb. 2008 (Accessed 27 Nov. 2013) and campaigned for a provisional government following the regime's having been handed a defeat in that year's national plebiscite. The following year he was elected president of the Communist Party, a position he held until 1994. Literary work Teitelboim's literary work, for which he was awarded Chile's National Prize in Literature in 2002, as well as the Literature prize of the 1931 Floral Games, is chiefly in the form of memoirs, biographies, and literary essays. His first book Antología de poesía chilena (Anthology of Chilean Poetry) was published in conjunction with Eduardo Anguita in 1932, and compiled the great poets of Chile. He would later say that it committed the errors of omitting Gabriela Mistral and of accentuating the dispute between Vicente Huidobro, Pablo de Rokha, and Pablo Neruda. His series of memoirs, Un muchacho del siglo XX (A Boy of the Twentieth Century, 1997), La gran guerra de Chile y otra que nunca existió (The Great War of Chile and Another That Never Existed, 2000) and Noches de radio (Radio Nights, 2001) present from a political and social perspective the great arch of Chilean history during the 20th century. His best known capacity is that of a biographer, in which he wrote about Jorge Luis Borges, Vicente Huidobro, and with the most critical acclaim, Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral. In terms of membership in literary movements, he is generally located within the Chilean Generation of '38. =List of published works= *Antología de poesía chilena (Anthology of Chilean Poetry) - 1935 *El amanecer del capitalismo.

Early life Rex was bred by dog breeder Irene Murphy of Greenwich, Connecticut. His registered name was Martlet-Or Worcester. Conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr. purchased littermate brother Freddy from the breeder and later arranged for President Reagan to purchase one-year-old Rex and give Rex as a Christmas present to his wife Nancy on December 6, 1985. The White House's previous canine occupant, the Reagans' Bouvier des Flandres named Lucky, had grown too large and had been moved to Reagan's Rancho del Cielo estate in California the preceding Thanksgiving. Rex was named for Rex Scouten, White House Chief Usher. One of Rex's first acts that week was helping to throw the switch that lit the National Christmas Tree. Residency at the White House Rex with the Reagans at Christmas Rex would live in the White House from that Christmas until Reagan left office in 1989, once gaining headlines when he underwent a tonsillectomy at an undisclosed veterinary hospital. Rex was treated to a lavishly decorated doghouse built by the Washington Children's Museum, which included framed portraits of Ronald and Nancy and red window draperies. It was designed by Theo Hayes, great-great grandson of President Rutherford B. Hayes, and actress Zsa Zsa Gabor reportedly conducted a dedication ceremony for the new structure. Nackey Loeb, wife of publisher William Loeb III, advised the Reagans to hire a dog trainer for Rex, as she felt it was detrimental to Nancy Reagan's image to have the dog pull her around in front of the press. The President responded to Loeb, stating that Rex was still young and got easily excited when helicopters land on the White House lawn to the extent that \\"he believes Marine I is his personal dog basket\\". Rex would ultimately be seen as being calmer than his predecessor Lucky, who is remembered for dragging Nancy Reagan across the White House lawn, while Rex was seen as being better behaved. Reportedly, Rex took a disliking to the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House. Thought to possibly be haunted by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, the dog would refuse to enter the room and sometimes would stand outside it and bark through the doorway. Rex's high-profile led in part to the sudden popularization of the breed in America in the years following Reagan's presidency. Later life and legacy As a leaving gift when Reagan departed, Rex was given a dog house resembling the White House, complete with a patch of carpet from Camp David. After Reagan left office, Rex lived to the age of 13 with the Reagan family before being euthanized after developing an enlarged heart due to mitral valve disease. He is interred at Rancho del Cielo. In 2009, Rex was named fourth in a list of the top Presidential pets by Petside.com.

The former site of the hotel, the block bounded by Broadway, Astor Plaza, West 44th Street, and West 45th Street, is now occupied by the high-rise 54-story office tower One Astor Plaza.  Construction  With its elaborately decorated public rooms and its roof garden, the Astor Hotel was perceived as the successor to the Astor family's Waldorf-Astoria on 34th Street. William C. Muschenheim and his brother, Frederick A. Muschenheim conceived plans for the grand hotel in 1900. The area was then known as Longacre Square and stood beyond the fringe of metropolitan life, the center of New York's carriage-building trade. The Muschenheim brothers became the proprietors for absentee landlord William Waldorf Astor, from whom they leased the land. The hotel opened on September 9, 1904. Times Square map in 1916 with Hotel Astor and nearby theaters The Hotel Astor was built in two stages, in 1905 and 1909–1910, by the same architects in the same style. Upon completion, the structure occupied an entire city block at a reported total cost of $7 million. Architects Clinton & Russell had designed a number of Astor commissions; here they developed a very Parisian \\"Beaux Arts\\" style completed with green-copper mansard roof. Its eleven stories contained 1000 guest rooms, with two more levels underground for its extensive \\"backstage\\" functions, such as the wine cellar. The Astor was an important element in the growth of Times Square and its character as an entertainment center. In 1904, New York Times publisher Adolph S. Ochs moved his newspaper's operations to a new tower on 42nd Street in the middle of Longacre Square, and Ochs persuaded Mayor George B. McClellan, Jr. to build a subway station there and rename it Times Square. The Theater District would soon occupy magnificent new auditoriums along Forty-second Street, and electric lighting transformed this strip of Broadway into the \\"Great White Way\\". Hotel Astor's success triggered the construction of the nearby Knickerbocker Hotel by other members of the Astor family two years later, although that property became commercial office space within a few years. The Astor set the pattern for \\"a new species of popular hotels that soon clustered around Times Square, vast amusement palaces that catered to crowds with scenographic interiors that mirrored the theatricality of the Great White Way.\\"  Amenities  southern end of the Grand Ballroom, circa 1910 Within its restrained exterior, the Astor featured a long list of elaborately themed ballrooms and exotic restaurants: the Old New York lobby, the American Indian Grill Room decorated with artifacts collected with the help of the American Museum of Natural History, a Flemish smoking room, a Pompeiian billiard room, the Hunt Room decorated in sixteenth century German Renaissance style, and many other features. 1922 ad for the Hotel Astor The Large Ballroom (or Banquet Hall), on the ninth floor, opened on September 29, 1909 with a dinner that was part of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. Measuring , the Banquet Hall was decorated in the Rococo style of Louis XV and featured a high-groined arch ceiling in ivory white and old gold, supported by grouped caryatids. A gallery spanned the south and west sides, affording a fine view of the room, which could accommodate 500 diners. The smaller ballroom, seating 250, was decorated in the neoclassical Louis XVI manner and could be joined with the larger ballroom. Still another adjoining room, \\"The College Hall\\", could also open to the ballroom so that the combined rooms could seat up 1,100 persons. The Palm Garden, or \\"L'Orangerie\\", located in the rear of the first floor lobby, was intended to represent an Italian garden. Its ceiling, painted to represent a Mediterranean sky, was partly concealed by feigned vine-covered pergolas. Blue lighting, hanging lamps draped in vines, swaying fern baskets, and scenic pictures of the out-of-doors further enhanced the perception. The rooftop garden, with bandstand and observatory, was one of a number constructed in the city between 1880 and Prohibition, among them the American Theater on Eighth Avenue, the garden atop Stanford White's 1890 Madison Square Garden, and the Paradise Roof Garden opened by Oscar Hammerstein I in 1900. In later years, the noted landscape architect Takeo Shiota redesigned the roof's North Garden on a Japanese theme. Artwork in the original lobby included four murals by William de Leftwich Dodge depicting Ancient and Modern New York. The ballroom held a marble group called the Three Graces, by sculptor Isidore Konti, with all three figures modeled on Audrey Munson, along with murals by designer Edward G. Unitt.  Social history  Peace Society dinner at the Hotel Astor, February 1909 with President Taft and Secretary of State Elihu Root in lower right As a popular meeting place and New York City landmark, the Astor had a place in popular culture for decades, from the extended double entendre song \\"She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor\\", to its appearance in the 1945 film The Clock, which provides a good view of the wartime-era lobby (although reconstructed in Hollywood). The first notable regular dance band at the Astor was that of Fred Rich, who made many records for Columbia Records and its budget subsidiary Harmony Records in the 1920s as \\"Fred Rich and his Hotel Astor Orchestra\\" and also as \\"The Astorites.\\" Among many other later musicians, the swing era bandleader Tommy Dorsey appeared regularly on the rooftop bandstand, and it was there that Frank Sinatra made early New York appearances with Dorsey's band from 1940 to 1942. Another regular, in the 1950s, was Carmen Cavallaro and his orchestra, advertised on the marquee under the banner \\"On the Astor Roof\\". In 1933, it was the site of Fiorello La Guardia's election night party when he was first elected mayor of New York. In 1947, stuntman John Ciampa scaled the exterior of the hotel as part of a publicity ploy for the Sunbrock Rodeo and Thrill Circus. A 1947 post card, Hotel Astor claimed \\"1000 rooms, 1000 baths\\" and as \\"The Crossroads of the World\\" Beginning in the 1910s, the Astor Bar acquired a reputation as a gay meeting place. During World War II, the Astor Bar was one of three American hotel bars \\"world famous for their wartime ambience\\", alongside the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco, and the men's bar at the Los Angeles Biltmore. Unlike the flamboyant late-night scenes at the automats, gay patrons at the Astor Bar were welcomed, allotted an entire side of the oval bar, and expected to be discreet (by the standards of the time). Thus \\"the Astor maintained its public reputation as an eminently respectable Times Square rendezvous, while its reputation as a gay rendezvous and pickup bar assumed legendary proportions.\\" The bar was further immortalized in Cole Porter's song \\"Well, Did You Evah!\\", which includes the line, \\"Have you heard that Mimsie Starr / Just got pinched in the Astor Bar?\\" The ribald tune \\"She Had to Go and Lose It at the Astor\\" explored a similar theme.  Later years  Rendering of the Astor's rooftop garden The hotel was completely renovated in 1935, and again in 1949. It was sold to real estate entrepreneur William Zeckendorf on September 1, 1954. However he sold it again just two weeks later, on September 15, 1954, to Sheraton Hotels, whIch renamed it the Sheraton-Astor. Zeckendorf repurchased the hotel in December 1957, regaining control of it in March 1958 and returning it to its original name. During this period, the hotel was managed by Prince Serge Obolensky. As an indirect result of Zeckendorf's 1965 bankruptcy, the Astor was sold for $10.5 million in 1966. It closed and was demolished in 1967 by Sam Minskoff & Sons.Broadway: An Encyclopedia by Ken Bloom November 11, 2003 The site is now occupied by a 54-story skyscraper designed by Der Scutt of Ely J.

He is a previous panellist on the Sunday Footy Show. Early career Thompson was recruited from Kyneton and debuted for the Hawthorn Football Club in 1998. A tall marking forward, Thompson was an important young player for the club considering he was selected in the 1997 AFL Draft at pick 82. Hawthorn career Thompson performed well in Hawthorn's 2001 campaign, in which they came within two goals of playing in the Grand Final, and Thompson finished 3rd in the Peter Crimmins Medal. Playing mostly at Full Forward with the occasional run in the ruck, Thompson was the club's leading goalkicker for seasons 2003 and 2004. =Depression= In 2004 Thompson admitted to the media that he had been suffering from clinical depression, a saga that raised awareness of the condition. North Melbourne career At the end of 2004, possibly following the need for a fresh start following his revelation of depression, Thompson was a prized recruit for the North Melbourne Football Club and was seen as a big forward option alongside Saverio Rocca at the club. In 2005 he debuted for the Kangaroos and found himself working in rotation and occasionally in tandem with Rocca up forward, although this was not a permanent move due to Rocca's age and the top-heaviness of the Roos' forward line. =2005 season= Thompson was the Kangaroos' leading goalkicker for 2005 with 52 goals and was considered a good choice for the Roos. One of Thompson's most memorable games was the clash against Collingwood in Round 19. With the Roos trailing by almost 4 goals late in the 4th quarter, Thompson was part of a revival where the Kangaroos managed to take the lead in the dying moments. His contribution was 3 goals, including the matchwinner just before the siren. He gestured with a Hulk Hogan-style fist pump which remained one of the famous images of the 2005 AFL season. =2006 season= In 2006 Thompson faced an eventful two weeks. In the Round 5 game against Melbourne, Thompson had helped the Kangaroos to get back in the game after they were trailing at half-time. Having booted 5 goals for the day and being in control of the Demons' defence, Thompson took a couple of important contested marks and was a dangerous presence up forward for North (in terms of scoring and marking power). He put the Kangaroos in front after they had trailed for much of the last three quarters and was on his way to perhaps putting in a match-winning performance. However following a desperate last-quarter chase of Melbourne's Nathan Carroll, Thompson in a shock move put himself on the bench, replacing himself with Drew Petrie. He was not sitting on the bench and was standing up, giving the impression that he wanted to come back onto the ground. Thompson later cited that he was \\"spent\\" and tired as the reasons for his early exit (Melbourne then went on to win the game with a last minute goal after the Kangaroos had several forward opportunities). This controversy received a lot of media attention but for Sirengate, which occurred the day following the North Melbourne-Melbourne match and was so big that Thompson's voluntary send off (compared to Sally Robbins' rowing controversy by some in the media) was put on the back-burner. In Round 6 Thompson said that he was willing to put the previous week's debacle aside and performed with an 8-goal haul, the best of his career, to give the Kangaroos a 22-point victory to lift them off the bottom of the ladder. Glenn Archer wrote an article after Nathan Thompson's taking off incident, from \\"Thommo's\\" view, he made a point that Thommo had lactic acid in his legs and he decided it would be better for the team if he swapped with Drew. =2007 Season= Thompson was going outstanding in the Pre-Season, with the new fast running attacking ball play ready to give him more of the footy. He kicked a Super Goal against Carlton in the Semi-Finals of the NAB Cup, then, a week later against St Kilda in a Practice Match, Thompson ruptured his ACL and missed the entire 2007 Season. While in Darwin for the Darwin Cup, Thompson criticised former North Melbourne Football Club champion Wayne Carey about his criticisms of the club, which led Carey to respond with mockery of Thompson's depression on the Nine Network's Sunday morning Footy Show. In addition, on returning from a commercial break, Carey was clearly heard to make references to 'necking himself', to the apparent delight of other members of the Footy Show panel. Carey and the Nine Network were quick to issue an apology over the incident, although no mention was officially made of the 'necking himself' comment. Thompson has recovered well from his knee injury and was considered a possibility of a return in 2007. His name was thrown around for the round 22 clash against the Western Bulldogs but he didn't end up playing. He also missed out on the finals with coach Laidley saying that he wouldn't risk changing the team's structure that had led to the success they had enjoyed over the season. Thompson will now be looking forward to a big return in 2008. =2008 Season= Thompson made his return to football in Round 1 of 2008 against the Bombers on Easter Monday. It was a good return, with Thompson booting 2 goals in the 1st quarter and 3 goals for the 1st half. He kicked 4 goals for the day as the Roos were smashed by the Bombers 9.13.67 to 19.8.122. Thompson's brilliant effort against Hawthorn in Round 13 earned him an AFL Army Award nomination. The publicly voted Award recognises courage, initiative and teamwork on the footy field. Fans have until 11:59 pm on Sunday, 29 June, to vote for Thompson at afl.com.au It was announced on The Footy Show that Thompson's career with North Melbourne would be coming to an end. Thompson officially announced his retirement after being delisted by North Melbourne on 19 September.Kangas' Thompson Bows Out Season 2009: Back to VFL On 24 December 2008, North Melbourne and Hawthorn spearhead Nathan Thompson has decided to come out of retirement and signed with VFL club Werribee Tigers next season after announcing his retirement from AFL ranks this year.

Liston Trophy winner James Podsiadly, who was a shock departure after crossing to Geelong's VFL team. Post AFL/VFL Career Thompson played for the Doncaster Football Club in Division 3 of the Eastern Football League and kicked 9 goals in the 2013 Grand Final against Wantirna South. In 2016 he returned to his home town of Kyneton in central Victoria to play for the Kyneton Tigers.

He is a former member of the Knesset for Likud and served as Minister of Communications. Biography =Early life= Kara was born in Daliyat al-Karmel, a Druze town near Haifa, in 1955. He went to an agricultural high school in Kfar Galim. He spent a year playing professional football as a defensive back for Bnei Yehuda Tel-Aviv. He later served in the Israel Defense Forces reserve and attained the rank of major before being discharged for posttraumatic stress disorder. Serving alongside Jews before and after the establishment of Israel has been a source of family pride; his uncle was killed during the Arab revolt in 1939 and his father served in the IDF during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Another uncle was also killed by Arabs then and two of his brothers were killed in action in the 1982 Lebanon War. Following his national service, Kara studied Business Administration. Today, he lives in Daliyat al-Karmel with his wife and five children. =Early political career: 1996–2006= Kara was placed 35th on the Likud-Gesher-Tzomet list, which won 32 seats in the 1996 elections. He urged Likud party chairman Ariel Sharon to campaign for the Arab vote. Sharon agreed on the importance of it and the need for an Arab minister in government. Kara was elected in 1999, becoming the third Druze Likud MK in history, after Amal Nasser el-Din and Assad Assad. He was appointed Deputy Speaker of the Knesset and served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Workers. He retained his seat in the 2003 elections and became chairman of the Anti-Drug Committee. Speaking out during the Second Intifada, he condemned Arab MKs for incitement. Kara loudly opposed the Gaza disengagement plan, championed by prime minister Ariel Sharon, and was almost ejected from Knesset with Michael Ratzon for \\"repeated disturbances\\". When Sharon announced plans to break from Likud, Kara refused to defect to Kadima in 2005 and slammed other MKs that did, including Shaul Mofaz. He praised Likud's \\"glorious past\\" and said it will return stronger, despite the split. He lost his seat in the 2006 elections, when Likud were reduced to just 12 seats. Despite being out of office, he remained active in politics. He met with Hebron residents and criticized the demolition of a Jewish home there, bashing Kadima chairman Tzipi Livni as \\"good for Hamas\\". =Deputy Minister: 2009–2013= Announcing his intention to run in the Likud primary for the 2009 elections, Kara called for unity between Druze and Jews, \\"to strengthen the Zionist connection...that has been damaged in recent years.\\" He reminded voters of his opposition to the disengagement, making it an important part of his campaign. He was placed 23rd on the party's list, and returned to the Knesset when Likud won 27 seats. Kara sought and received a ministerial post: becoming Israel's new Deputy Minister of the Development of the Negev and Galilee. He is the first non-Jewish nationalist to receive a portfolio. Kara opposed the inclusion of Kadima in Netanyahu's government, saying that Likud had \\"no room for traitors\\". As Deputy Minister, Kara cited demographic issues as a growing threat to Israel. He promoted development of the two regions to encourage Jews to stay and work there. He worked to help former soldiers to study for free at colleges in the Negev and Galilee, as well as a new college of medicine in the latter. He also supported the building of casinos in the Negev. In addition, he promoted a program in Knesset to train Druze firefighters that will serve in Jewish towns in the West Bank. Later, with Kara's help, ZAKA volunteers began to establish volunteer rescue services in northern Druze and Arab towns in September 2010, starting with Beit Jann and Yirka. Foreign relations Shortly after the election, the family of Ouda Tarabin, an Israeli Bedouin who was convicted of espionage in absentia by Egypt, enlisted Kara's support to gain Tarabin's release. Tarabin entered Egypt in 2000 illegally, and was arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Kara also led a group of Druze, Bedouins, and Muslims that met with the family of Gilad Shalit to show support for his release from Hamas, who kidnapped Shalit in a 2006 raid. Kara met with Turkish ambassador to Israel, Ahmet Oğuz Çelikkol, to improve Israel–Turkey relations, citing Turkey as a \\"proven\\" friend to Israel. However, relations deteriorated after the Gaza flotilla raid. Kara has also been instrumental in improving relations with Syria and Lebanon. Just before the 2009 election, he claimed to have met with Syrian officials in Washington, D. C., who said Syria was interested in revisiting talks to improve relations. However, the Syrian embassy in Washington denied the meeting took place, as did a spokesman for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has also been outspoken in his opposition to proposed divisions of the border village of Ghajar, comparing it to the Berlin Wall. For much of 2010, he has worked to improve economic and humanitarian ties between Israel and Syria. Druze farmers in the Golan now import water from Syria and export thousands of tons of apples every year. In addition, Druze have been able to visit relatives in Syria for the first time in decades and also receive organ transplants there. In addition, he has coordinated burials for families between Syria, Lebanon, and the Golan. Kara is hopeful that these \\"cracks in the great wall between Israel and Syria\\" will one day lead to real negotiations for peace. Or at the very least, he hopes to cut down the bureaucracy preventing humanitarian exchanges between Israel and Syria. Kara has also called for mines to be removed from the Golan, citing them as dangerous to travelers and not needed for Israel's defense. When several pro-Israel European politicians visited Israel, Kara and other Knesset members joined the Europeans to condemn the Gaza disengagement and lack of assistance to former Jewish residents of Gaza, who had been expelled from their homes. Kara urged stronger relationships with European politicians that support Israel. Kara visited Austria in December 2010 and met with Heinz- Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party of Austria, praising him at a joint press conference and calling him a \\"friend of Israel\\" in its war on terror. Austria's Jewish community complained in a letter addressed to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu about the meeting and the praise and honor bestowed by Kara on the party and its members, particularly in light of the party's anti-semitic remarks and their praise for the Nazi regime of the Third Reich. Israel had scaled back its diplomatic relations with Austria when the party entered into the Austrian government a few years ago. The head of a South Sudan delegation to a February 2011 meeting of a new organization to develop Nigeria, Suleiman Alhariri, invited Kara to the newly forming country to help begin setting up diplomatic relations. Kara led a delegation of Jewish, Muslim, Druze, and Christian religious leaders to discuss interfaith relations in Istanbul with TV show host Adnan Oktar. The delegation presented a list of Jewish religious sites in Syria for the opposition in the Syrian Civil War to guard, should unrest threaten the sites. The group planned to set up a religious court to arbitrate regional disputes. Kara also said \\"Turkey is eager to reestablish its ties with Israel.\\" In May 2011, Kara claimed that the opposition movement in the Syrian Civil War had approached him to seek help for their movement from the United Nations, United States, and European Union. =2013= Kara was placed 39th on the Likud Yisrael Beiteinu list for the 2013 elections, losing his seat as the alliance won only 31 seats. However, he returned to the Knesset following the 2015 elections, for which he was placed 24th on the Likud list. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Minister of Regional Cooperation. In January 2017, Netanyahu appointed Kara as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. In May of the same year, Netanyahu appointed Kara as Minister of Communications.Government 34 Knesset =2019= In the 2019 elections, Kara lost Netanyahu's support and was placed 39th in the Likud list, and was not elected.איוב קרא סוגר חשבון: \\"תקעו לי סכין בגב\\", YNET, 24 April 2019 In September 2019, a tape was leaked of a conversation between Kara and Netanyahu in which the latter demanded that Kara close down the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Council. Kara was blamed by several Likud politicians for the leak, but denied involvement. Political positions Kara is known as a staunch conservative in the Knesset, supporting \\"hawkish\\" and Zionist views. He opposed the Gaza disengagement and the 2009–10 settlement freeze. He was a supporter of Moshe Feiglin's Manhigut Yehudit faction, within Likud. =Gaza= During the months preceding the disengagement from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank, Kara requested from then Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, that Druze soldiers not be assigned to tasks related to the disengagement, since the Druze opposed the disengagement and did not want to have anything to do with it. He was threatened with expulsion from the Knesset for trying to obstruct the plan as it went through. The Israeli media called him the \\"prophet of fury\\". Years earlier, he opposed the withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, warning that Hezbollah would gain power in Israel's absence. After the Gaza flotilla clash, Kara spoke with a leading mufti in Turkey. He told the mufti that Israel conducted the operation legally and humanely and presented facts backing his claims. In addition, he said \\"Israel is the most humanitarian country in the Middle East and never objected to the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza,\\" and the flotilla organizers intended to provoke Israel. He also asked the mufti to preach brotherhood between Israel and Turkey, \\"saying there are no winners in war.\\" At a meeting hosted by Turkish television personality Adnan Oktar, Kara stated that flotillas must carry humanitarian aid and not weapons. He said that Israel wanted to work with Turkey to transfer humanitarian aid to Gaza. =Iran= Kara supports an Israeli strike against Iran's nuclear program and assured that other Muslim nations would support a strike, albeit quietly, and not publicly. In April 2010, the MK made public that he had been approached by an Israeli woman of Persian Jewish origin, who had been contacted by an Iranian nuclear scientist seeking asylum in Israel. Kara stated he would help and that the scientist was staying in a \\"friendly country\\", but there has been no word on the plan since the announcement. Following a planned visit by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the Israel-Lebanon border, Kara organized a rally in which 2,000 blue and white balloons would be released if Ahmadinejad came, stating that \\"the balloons represent the fact that the Jewish people have come home after 2,000 years of exile, and are not going anywhere\\". Kara also stated that as a non-Jew, he appreciated Israel's freedom and democracy, and that were it not for the Jewish people, the entire region would look like Iran. Kara also claims to have sent Ahmadinejad a letter in Persian, in which he expressed \\"the Israeli nation's desire for peace, and its willingness to defend itself\\". At the event, Kara criticized the Israeli government for inaction, and called Ahmadinejad \\"a catastrophe for the world\\" and said that Israel wants peace, not wars. He also warned that Ahmadinejad intends to rebuild the Persian Empire, using Lebanon as an army base. =Arab-Israeli conflict and peace= Kara believes that Israel \\"has no one to make peace with\\", and that all the peace partners aim to weaken Israel. He noted that many Israelis think like Europeans and do not understand the thought process in the Middle East. He criticized the Oslo accords for giving \\"the criminal Palestinian leadership that was in Lebanon and Tunisia the legitimacy to be leaders in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza\\". In July 2010, Kara warned Israel not to be tricked by United States president Barack Obama's apparent sympathy for Israel. Kara stated that Obama \\"doesn't sound evil now because he needs Jewish votes and money, but I won't forget the pressure he put on Netanyahu and the stress I saw in the prime minister the last time he came back from Washington\\". Several days later, in an interview, he endorsed a three-state solution, saying that Egypt should resume control over Gaza. He noted that Arabs almost universally call for a restoration of the situation prior to the Six-Day War, when Gaza was part of Egypt. In addition, he mentioned that it would be beneficial to the security of Egypt to eliminate Iranian influence in the territory. In an interview, Kara noted that \\"In all history there was never a Palestinian state.\\" He proposed that Jordan, which is 90% Palestinian take administrative control of Arab cities in the West Bank, while Israel would control defense, major cities, and broad areas in the territory. During the 2010 Israel forest fire, Kara stated he had information that the fire was \\"a terrorist act\\"—arson—and called for the perpetrators to be executed like Adolf Eichmann. Some of the 41 killed in the blaze were Druze. In 2011, Kara and fellow MK Aryeh Eldad met with Glenn Beck. After Eldad said that there was a Palestinian state in Jordan, Kara added \\"the world doesn't understand that there are already two states here, and now, they want three states. There were never Palestinians in this area\\"LAHAV HARKOV. Beck’s love for Israel not ‘right’ enough for some MKs . The Jerusalem Post. During the same meeting, he explained his Zionism as consistent with the Druze tradition that they are descendants of Jethro, and \\"commanded to watch over the Land of Israel for the People of Israel\\". At the first International Regional Cooperation Conference in Tel Aviv, Kara said Israel should negotiate with businessmen rather than the Palestinian Authority leadership. =Settlements= A staunch supporter of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Kara spoke at a ceremony marking the end of the settlement freeze. He criticizing it as not helpful to Israel or the PA and said that the killings of four Israelis near Kiryat Arba shows that the freeze only serves as \\"appeasement\\" and is not working. At an event marking the construction of a new building in the West bank, Kara stated: \\"The expulsion of Jews from Gush Katif brought zero results, the expulsion of the Israeli army from Lebanon has brought zero results, and the construction freeze brought zero results.\\" Kara attended an Israeli version of the American tea party protests with other Likud MKs and members. Speakers at the event called on Obama to stop pressuring Netanyahu and for the prime minister to stand his ground and uphold Jewish rights and values. In 2010, Kara attended a rally marking the end of the construction slow down in Revava, that was also attended by hundreds of Christian supporters of Israel. He welcomed the tourists saying: \\"I say to all the non-Jews who are here, I too am not a Jew, but in spirit I am most Jewish, I am most Zionist, and so are you! Good for you that you are here to support Israel.\\"Christians bolster Jews as settlement freeze ends In 2011, however, he abstained from a vote brought by National Union MKs that would extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank. =Relationship with Donald Trump= Following the violent Unite the Right rally, attended by neo-Nazis and other far-right protesters which took place in the United States in August 2017 Kara defended U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump's response to the protest and his failure to immediately condemn the rally received much criticism, including from some in Israel. Kara, however, suggested relations with Trump were more important, stating \\"Due to the terrific relations with the US, we need to put the declarations about the Nazis in the proper proportion.\\" Kara also described the Obama administration as \\"terrible\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israeli- communications-minister-ayoub-kara-relations-donald-trump-important- condemning-neo-nazis-a7903931.html =Calls for imposition of the death penalty= In 2010 Kara called for the imposition of the death penalty on the perpetrator of the Tapuah Junction stabbing. =2017 visit to Poland= Ayoob Kara was part of a delegation of Israeli politicians who visited Poland at the invitation of the Polish Redemptorist priest Tadeusz Rydzyk in late 2017. The purpose of the visit was to support Rydzyk's effort to draw greater attention to the Polish Righteous Among the Nations who saved Jews from the Nazis during the Holocaust. Rydzyk and his radio station, Radio Maryja, have repeatedly been accused of anti-Semitism, notably by the Anti-Defamation LeagueRadio Maryja: 25 Years of Anti-Semitism - ADL website and the World Jewish Congress.Anti-Semitic Polish priest condemned by Jewish Congress leader - 9 October 2007 On 26 October 2017, together with Knesset Deputy Speaker Yehiel Bar, Rabbi Dov Lipman (a former Knesset member of the Yesh Atid party) and other politicians, Kara attended a Radio Maryja commemoration ceremony in Torun devoted to the theme of \\"Remembrance and Hope\\" and attended by then Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło.[TYLKO U NAS Y.

Design was initiated in 1938 by the German and Swiss branches, the latter being responsible for the actual construction of the prototype. The Do 212 was an all-metal cantilever monoplane with fixed wingtip floats and a 343 kW (460 hp) Hirth HM 512-B-0 12-cylinder air-cooled engine which, mounted aft of the cabin, was buried in the fuselage and drove a four-blade airscrew aft of the tail by means of a shaft which could be tilted upward 12° to provide water clearance. Initial water taxiing trials resulted in the enlarging of the wingtip floats. On 3 August 1942, a few attempts to take off from water were made, but these failed. A Do 24 was used to tow the Do 212 and it finally flew; however, instability forced the pilot to ditch just after takeoff. Further trials ended the same way. Difficulties were also experienced with the extension shaft, and the cooling of the engine presented a problem. Consequently, no further testing was undertaken, and the prototype was scrapped in 1943.

The National SMART grant was introduced to help maintain the edge that United States has in the fields of Science and Technology. Only specific majors were eligible for the SMART grant, the complete list is given below. History The National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant was introduced by Senator Bill Frist, R-Tennessee and approved by the Senate on 21 December 2005 as part of the Higher Education Reconciliation Act. President Bush signed the bill into law on Feb 8, 2006. IMPORTANT NOTE: This program ended June 30, 2011 Application Applying for the National SMART grant requires the student and the student's family to complete a Free Application For Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Eligible students based on GPA, major and Pell Grant eligibility will be identified by the educational institute. The applicant does not need to file a separate application for being considered for a SMART grant.http://www.studentelligence.com/federal-grants/smart-grant/national- smart-grant.html Eligibility The student must be a U.S Citizen, must be enrolled in a qualifying four year degree program, must be in the third or fourth year of the program, must be eligible to receive a Pell Grant in the same year, must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 =Qualifying Degree Programs= Eligible degree programs or majors for the SMART grant are Science (including Computer Science, Physical and Life Sciences), Engineering, Technology, Mathematics, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Critical foreign language studies and certain natural resource conservation and multidisciplinary programs. In August 2006, The Chronicle of Higher Education noted that evolutionary biology had been removed from the list of qualifying majors. This caused concern among some scientists and educators, who feared that the omission was deliberate and politically motivated. The Department of Education has denied this, stating that the major was removed from the list inadvertently, and that it would correct the omission. In September 2006, evolutionary biology, along with exercise physiology, were added to the list of eligible majors. Award Amount The grant awards a maximum of $4,000 a year. The amount of the SMART Grant, when combined with a Pell Grant, may not exceed the student's cost of attendance. In addition, if the number of eligible students is large enough that payment of the full grant amounts would exceed the program appropriation in any fiscal year, then the amount of the grant to each eligible student may be ratably reduced.

In addition, Professor Arnon served as the Director of the Institute's MacArthur Center for Molecular Biology of Tropical Diseases from 1958–94. Much of Arnon's work has been in the development of vaccinations and cancer research. One of her largest contributions to science was working alongside Professor Michael Sela to develop a drug for multiple sclerosis called Copaxone. The development of Copaxone began with their successful synthesis of the first synthetic antigen. They, along with Devorah Tietelbaum who was at the time a doctoral student, discovered that a material synthetically produced in the lab could suppress a disease found in animals that is a model for multiple sclerosis. After thirty years of research Copaxone was approved for medical use. Ruth Arnon, Jewish Women's Archives Arnon served as the Chairperson of the Sciences division of the Israel Academy of Sciences from 1995 to 2001. She later was elected as President of the Israel Academy. She is also a member of the EMBO, the European Molecular Biology Organization. Arnon served as Secretary-General of the International Union of Immunological Sciences, the President of the European Federation of Immunological Societies, and is also a member of the European Union Research Advisory Board. Arnon has published more than four hundred articles in biochemistry and immunology. She was a visiting professor at the Rockefeller Institute (New York), University of Washington (Seattle), University of California (Los Angeles), Pasteur Institute (Paris), Walter and Elise Hall Institute (Melbourne), Imperial Cancer Research Fund (London), and the Curie Institute (Paris). =Copaxone= Arnon and Sela developed a new drug application for the treatment of multiple sclerosis called Copolymer 1. Its chemical name is glatiramer acetate. It was submitted by the TEVA Pharmaceutical Company to the FDA for approval, under the name of Copaxone, on June 14, 1995. Since multiple sclerosis is an immunological disease, Cop 1 is an immunospecific drug, which is no surprise, as Arnon has focused the majority of her work in the field of immunology. It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in myelination as a result of Cop 1. In a 2004 article, Arnon and Aharoni state that glatiramer acetate is \\"highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species.\\" =Current Research= Arnon is researching a universal, recombinant influenza vaccination, as well as a cancer vaccine. A 2009 paper discusses the use of virus-like particles (VLP) to induce an immune response.= These particles cannot replicate, but possess the specific antigen-presenting proteins that immune cells use to identify viruses. Therefore, a vaccine could introduce VLPs to an individual's immune system and bring about the production of memory cells. Arnon and Ben-Yedidia hypothesize that these vaccines would be effective against H5N1, a pandemic virus more commonly known as bird flu. They have tested the various synthetic vaccinations on mice and observed a significant immune response. In addition, they have put human lymphocytes in mice and also observed an immune response.Prof. Ruth Arnon. Weizmann Institute of Science: Department of Immunology [Internet]. [cited 15 Apr 2015]; Available from http://www.weizmann.ac.il/immunology/sci/ArnonPage.html Their research formed the basis of the company BiondVax, who have taken the universal flu vaccine into human clinical trials. In 2017 Arnon was appointed co-chair of the UK-Israel Science Council, alongside Prof. Lord Robert Winston. She has been a founding member of the council since 2010.

It drains an area of 712 mi² (1844 km²). The Grand River begins in southeastern Geauga County and initially flows eastward into Trumbull County. Downstream of West Farmington it turns northward into Ashtabula County, where it flows through the village of Rock Creek and then turns westward into Lake County, where it flows through the communities of Painesville and Grand River before flowing into Lake Erie in Fairport Harbor.*DeLorme (1991). Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. Watershed description  On January 17, 1974, the Grand River became Ohio's second wild and scenic river. Designated sections include: from Harpersfield covered bridge downstream to the Norfolk and Western Railway trestle south of Painesville (wild, 23 miles) and from the US 322 in Ashtabula County downstream to Harpersfield covered bridge (scenic, 33 miles). The Grand Wild and Scenic River represents one of the finest examples of a natural stream to be found anywhere in Ohio. Due to its rugged topography, the Grand River has not until recently felt the influences of urbanization. During the Pleistocene or Ice Age, the Wisconsinan glacier spread over Ohio in lobes, one of which is known as the Grand River lobe. This lobe ground and scraped its way south across northeastern Ohio, but was halted by the steep, erosion-resistant sandstone hills found to the south. The upper portion of the Grand River in Ashtabula County is designated scenic. The river is bordered in many areas by extensive swamp forests of elm, ash, maple, pine, pin oak and swamp white oak. The slow flow of this section of the river along with the adjoining wetlands provides excellent habitat for a number of wildlife species, especially river otters, which have made a strong comeback after their reintroduction by the Division of Wildlife in 1986 and 1988. The lower section of the Grand River in Lake County is designated wild. Here, the river is characterized by steeply- incised valley walls of Chagrin Shale. A view of the river in this area is truly spectacular especially following spring and summer showers when waterfalls cascade over the steep shale bluffs. Insuring the natural heritage of the Grand River is not limited to protecting the immediate streamside environment. Land use activities within the watershed; such as urban and residential development may have a direct and adverse effect on the long-term protection and preservation of this important Ohio water resource. The Grand River has the most aquatic diversity of any Ohio Lake Erie tributary. The Grand River has an active partnership group working with the state scenic rivers program and other agencies to assist with the rivers preservation.

Walking on Marston matting. Marston Mat, more properly called pierced (or perforated) steel planking (PSP), is standardized, perforated steel matting material developed by the United States at the Waterways Experiment Station shortly before World War II, primarily for the rapid construction of temporary runways and landing strips (also misspelled as Marsden matting). The nickname came from Marston, North Carolina, adjacent to Camp Mackall airfield where the material was first used. Description A section of Marston Mat used to construct the Alexai Point Landing Field in 1943, Attu Island, Alaska, c. 2006 Pierced (Pressed, Steel Planking, named after the manufacturing process) steel planking consisted of steel strips with punched lightening holes in it. These holes were in rows, and a formation of U-shaped channels between the holes. Hooks were formed along one long edge and slots along the other long edge so that adjacent mats could be connected. The short edges were cut straight with no holes or hooks. To achieve lengthwise interlocking, the mats were laid in a staggered pattern. The hooks were usually held in the slots by a steel clip that filled the part of the slot that is empty when the adjacent sheets are properly engaged. The holes were bent up at their edges so that the beveled edge stiffened the area around the hole. In some mats a T-shaped stake could be driven at intervals through the holes to keep the assembly in place on the ground. Sometimes the sheets were welded together. A typical later PSP was the M8 landing mat. A single piece weighed about 66 pounds and was long by wide. The hole pattern for the sheet was three holes wide by 29 holes long, resulting in 87 holes per mat. The M9 mat, made from aluminum, was produced to allow easier transportation by aircraft, since it weighed about two-thirds as much. Aluminum plank was referred to as PAP, for perforated aluminum planking, but was and is not as common. Aluminum was a controlled strategic material during World War II, so much less was made; it was typically only able to handle half as many loading cycles as steel, and its high scrap value and short usable life led to recycling rather than reuse. After the war, PSP was used by many southeastern U.S. auto racing teams, since it was manufactured in the area, and available from many abandoned military airfields. It was also used during a similar period when NASCAR teams used car trailers. History =World War II= A Curtiss P-40 Warhawk piloted by Squadron Leader Keith \\"Bluey\\" Truscott of No. 76 Squadron RAAF taxiing along Marston Mat at Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea in September 1942 Marston Mat was extensively used during World War II by Army engineers and Seabees (construction battalions) to build runways and other readily usable surfaces over all kinds of terrain. An early in-theater use of PSP was in constructing a 5,000 foot runway on Greenland's 'Bluie West One' (BW-1), an Allied Ferry Command and U.S.A.A.F airfield located on the extreme southwest corner of Greenland, at the termination of Eriksfjord, and near the coastal community of Narsarsuaq. Construction began in early fall 1941, and the first aircraft landed on Jan 24, 1942. Deemed a success, it was then used extensively in the Pacific Theater of Operations. A C-47 Skytrain supply aircraft was the first plane to land on the first steel-mat runway constructed in France after the invasion of Normandy. On Pacific islands the matting was typically covered with crushed and rolled coral or soil to form a level surface. The perforated and channeled design of the matting created strength and rigidity and facilitated drainage. A runway two hundred feet wide and 5000 feet (1500 m) long could be created within two days by a small team of engineers. =Berlin Airlift= At the start of the Berlin Airlift the runways at Tempelhof Airport in the US Zone of Berlin were made of PSP. Designed to support fighters and smaller cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-54 Skymaster that formed the backbone of the U.S. effort was too heavy for the PSP. Berliners were hired to fix the runway between the three-minute arrivals, running onto the runways with bags of sand to dump onto the mats and soften the surface. =Vietnam era= With the deployment of jet aircraft and helicopters, foreign object damage (FOD) became a larger hazard. In moist tropical areas, such as Vietnam, vegetation growing through the mats also became an issue. Jet blast or rotor downdraft could stir up loose materials on the ground, which might then be sucked into jet inlets, and vegetation required mowing or herbicides. The M8A1 mat was developed to prevent this, omitting the pierced holes that exposed the soil beneath. This mat has a solid surface, strengthened by corrugations that also encouraged the drainage of rainwater. The mat size also changed to be . Later mats were developed in a lightweight aluminum version, . This was made as a hollow extrusion, rather than pressed. Aluminum matting allows greater quantities to be airlifted. Its greater scrap value encourages theft, so steel is preferred for larger or long-term installations. Landing mats of all types were widely used for construction of bunker roofs and for reinforcing field fortifications, as well as service roads inside fire support bases. =Legacy= Marston Mat repurposed for storage of empty wine bottles on a farm in Normandy in 2007. Hooks and slots along long edges clearly visible A huge quantity of Marston matting was left in the Philippines by the U.S. forces after World War II. Many of these were re-purposed as fencing material in housing projects that were built after the war. This one, behind the little boy, is located in a housing development in the 1950s that was initially referred to as \\"Project One\\", but later came to be known as Kamuning, Quezon City, near Manila. Photo is dated May 1965.

The name in Cantonese means banyan tree head, and many banyan trees are still there. Yung Shue Tau is known natively but seldom written on the maps. The temple and square are deemed as the heart of the Yau Ma Tei and the remnant of fishing traditions.

It splits the Temple Street into north and south sections. While the square was directly facing the Yau Ma Tei waterfront in the late 19th century, it is now almost three kilometers from the shore, as a consequence of land reclamation.

As this cranial morphology does not suit an ambush predator, it lends support to the idea of a diet of aquatic invertebrates.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town on the Riverina Highway in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. Berrigan is in the Berrigan Shire local government area and contains the Berrigan Shire Council offices. At the , Berrigan had a population of 1,260. History The earliest association with settlement in the area comes in 1849 through the agency of Momalong Station, where Robert Rand had settled some 22.5 thousand acres. The location of the town was formerly swamp land. The unfavourable location was chosen as the mail run from Corowa to Murray Hut ran through Berrigan on much the same location as the present Riverina Highway, and the road from Jerilderie lies on the same route now as it did back then. The Berrigan Post Office opened on 11 May 1884. In 1888, the first hotel - Berrigan Hotel - was built on the intersection of the two main roads through to town, with other stores rapidly following along Chanter Street. This hotel still stands today, although it is now a private residence. Other hotels include the Momalong Hotel, also now a private residence, and the Federal Hotel and Royal Hotel, both still active. Berrigan was officially proclaimed on 31 May 1890, and this only increased the establishment of the commercial section of the town, as well as the residential. The population in 1891 had reached 254, which more than doubled by Federation. The railway officially opened in late 1896, being the first pioneer light railway in the colony. The first issue of the Berrigan Advocate was published on Friday, 23 October 1891. The paper eventually merged with the Finley Mail and Tocumwal Guardian & Riverina Stock Journal, becoming the Southern Riverina News in 1970. =Involvement in federation= Because of its location near the border with Victoria, Berrigan was one of the pioneers in the push for an Australian Federation. It was at the suggestion of the Berrigan Australian Natives' Association that the first meeting of the Federation League was held. Due to its centrality, the meeting was held in Corowa. Australian Parliament House website - Senate publications Brian de Garis How Popular was the Popular Federation Movement Education Front gates of Berrigan Public School, celebrating its centenary Berrigan has both a state and Catholic primary school. The nearest high school is in Finley, to the west. Oaklands has a Central School, that is a part of the Riverina Access Partnership. Sport The crowd at the 2008 Berrigan Gold Gup race meeting Popular sports in Berrigan include Australian rules football (the town has a team competing in the Picola & District Football League), netball, golf, bowls, and tennis. Horse racing is also popular, with the Berrigan Gold Cup — held on the same day as the Victoria Derby — attracting a large crowd. Other attractions Held annual on the Sunday of the October long week is the Berrigan Agricultural Show, which has been in existence for over 120 years. The annual Show & Shine is held in January. A major event previously held in the town was the annual Canola Festival, celebrating the importance of canola to the region. Although this event has since ceased, canola is still an important part of the landscape. It is also close to the Murray River communities of Barooga and Tocumwal. Located between Berrigan and Barooga is 'The Drop', which is Australia's first hydroelectric power station on an irrigation canal, the Mulwala Canal. The power station had a generating capacity of 2.5 MW of electricity. Federal Hotel Once a thriving town with four pubs and the golf club, it has since been reduced to two pubs and the club. The aging population is well catered for in such a small town, with world class hospice and respite facilities provided. While the town thrives on the farming income generated in the district, it is a very modern, and family- friendly town. In 2013, an Alzheimer's wing was opened, catering to the numerous residents suffering from the disease. The localities of Boomanoomana and Mount Gwynne are about 30 km. south.

The station serves the entire Western New York region and into Toronto. WBSU is known better today as 89.1 The Point. The station is owned by State University of New York, and operates from The College at Brockport.  History  The Radio Club began at College at Brockport in the late 1950s and, shortly thereafter, efforts began to acquire a FM frequency. Starting in 1957, the Radio Club began broadcasting via public address to the student union on the Brockport campus. On May 1, 1964, the station, then known as WBSN began transmitting to the entire campus via telephone lines. In January 1970, the station moved into its present facilities in the Seymour College Union and became WBSU-AM at 600 kHz over what was known as a \\"carrier current\\" system that used campus electrical lines as an antenna. Customized logo for 89.1 The Point that's used in the winter.Following many years of hard work and patience, WBSU-FM was born on January 14, 1981 with 10 watts at 88.9. Thanks to the efforts of many people including the FM Task Force, Lloyd Trufelman, Dr, Melvin Smagorinsky, Edward Rothstein, Chief Engineer Bernard Lynch, Brian Issacson, Dr. Fred Powell, Martha Walstrum, Frank Filardo, Terrin Hover, Harry Goldberg, Scott Fishman and many others, the dream finally became a reality. The first General Manager was David Van Wie and he spearheaded an immediate power increase to 150 watts in May of that year. Following Van Wie four years later was Timothy \\"Jazz Urban\\" Lyman who was instrumental in the May, 1989 move to 89.1 at 7,338 watts where The Point now stands. The station's Broadcast Electronics 3.5 kW transmitter and 3-bay directional Shivley Labs antenna sits atop Mortimer Hall - a 12-story dormitory. Under the leadership of General Manager Warren \\"Koz\\" Kozireski, the 1990s brought much technological change to the station starting with a new Orban Optimod 8100 signal processor in the transmitter, under the recommendation of then Engineering Director Lester Wilson, who proclaimed at a Brockport Student Government board meeting that the upgrade would \\"give the station balls\\", and thus, the BSG board approved the purchase. WBSU implemented a computerized music playlist in 1992, new studio consoles in 1992 and 1994, and digital equipment during the summer of 1995. The Point's web site was created in 1997 and began webcasting in 1999. Their latest digital upgrade came in January 2005 and we installed a digital audio editing system in August 2005. WBSU-FM became 89.1 the Point with a new logo on June 10, 1998 in an effort to simplify the stations nickname. The hope was to make it easier to remember and make the station more marketable. The station has been recognized four times by the New York State Broadcasters Association for excellence in broadcasting in competition with other professional stations around the state as well as ten other awards from national organizations since 1988. The station received two awards from the Broadcast Education Association in 2003 and two from the now-defunct National Association of Collegiate Broadcasters in the 1990s. College Broadcasters, Inc. (CBI) has recognized the station as a national finalist in their National Student Production Awards competition once in 2003, twice in 2004, once in 2005, twice in 2007 and once more in 2008. The success of the alumni is their ultimate legacy as they continue to represent Brockport in their broadcast and related careers in New York City, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Atlanta and Tampa nationally and Rochester, Utica, Buffalo, Binghamton, Albany and Syracuse more locally.  Programming  In May 2011, the Point worked with Brockport's Fire and Police department to encourage High School students at Brockport High School to not drink and drive. WBSU is run by volunteer students at The College at Brockport and plays Top 40, Rock, and Alternative music. The Point also takes song requests at (585)395-2500 from the local community. There are several different programs featured on the station.  Freeway Giveaway  Every weekday between 4-6pm, The Point gives away prizes to listeners who call in.

The station is owned by American General Media and broadcasts a classic rock format. History The station's first license was granted in 1962 to John C. Cohan with the call letters KVEC-FM. In November 1965, Cohen sold KVEC-FM and its AM counterpart to West Coast Broadcasters Inc. for $360,000. The new owner then changed the FM station's call sign to KSBY-FM. In June 1975, KSBY-FM changed its call sign to KZOZ. At the time, the station was branded as \\"KZOZ Stereo 93\\" and aired an album- oriented rock format. The 1980s brought several major changes at the station. On June 17, 1980, KZOZ changed call signs to KZOZ-FM and flipped to top 40 with the branding \\"Z93\\". The station reverted to the KZOZ call letters on November 10, 1986. In December 1987, Phoenix Broadcasting Company sold KZOZ and then-sister station KKAL to Tattersall-Commonwealth Broadcasters Company for $3,615,000. The combo changed hands again in February 1989, when Tattersall-Commonwealth sold the pair to Anthony Brandon and L. Rogers Brandon for $2 million. The Brandons' radio company would later be known as American General Media. On October 14, 1991, KZOZ switched formats from top 40 to classic rock, dropping its longtime \\"Z93\\" branding. In 2003, KZOZ hired David Atwood as programming director. Atwood adjusted the station's music library in an active rock direction, adding newer songs alongside the existing classic rock as a response to the rise of modern rock rival KURQ.

Early life Lionel Charles Dunsterville was born in Lausanne, Switzerland on 9 November 1865, the son of Lieutenant General Lionel D'Arcy Dunsterville (1830–1912) of the Indian Army and his wife, Susan Ellen (1835–1875). He went to school with Rudyard Kipling and George Charles Beresford at The United Services College, a public school later absorbed into Haileybury and Imperial Service College, which prepared British young men for careers in Her Majesty's Army. He served as the inspiration for the character \\"Stalky\\" in Kipling's collection of school stories Stalky & Co. He was also uncle to H.D. Harvey-Kelly, the first Royal Flying Corps pilot to land in France in during the First World War. Military career Dunsterville was commissioned into the British Army in 1884. Later he transferred to the Indian Army and served on the North-West Frontier, in Waziristan and in China. He was promoted to major on 23 August 1902. In the First World War Dunsterville held a posting in India. At the end of 1917 the army appointed Major-General Dunsterville to lead an Allied force (Dunsterforce) of fewer than 1,000 Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand troops, drawn from the Mesopotamian and Western Fronts, accompanied by armoured cars, from Hamadan in the Zagros Mountains of Persia for some 350 km across Qajar Persia. His mission set out from Baghdad in January 1918, aiming to gather information, to train and command local forces, and to prevent the spread of German propaganda. The Azerbaijani Turks: power and identity under Russian rule, Audrey L. Altstadt On his way to Enzeli on the Persian Caspian coast he also fought Mirza Kuchik Khan and his Jangali forces in Manjil. Dunsterville was assigned to re-inforce the defence of the key oil-field and port of Baku (in present-day Azerbaijan), held from 26 July 1918 by the anti-Soviet Centro Caspian Dictatorship. Dunsterforce personnel first arrived in Baku on 6 August 1918. However, the British and their allies had to abandon Baku on 14 September 1918 in the face of an onslaught by 14,000 Ottoman troops, who took the city the next day. The Allies regained control of Baku within two months as a result of the Ottoman armistice of 30 October 1918. Promoted to major general in 1918, Dunsterville died in 1946 at Torquay, Devon, England. Family Captain Lionel Charles Dunsterville of the Indian Staff Corps married Margaret Emily (known as \\"Daisie\\"), daughter of Captain John Walter Keyworth late 48th Regiment, in November 1897 at Bishopsteignton, Devon, England. Their elder son, Lionel Walter Dunsterville, was born on 9 September 1902 at Tientsin, China; their younger son Galfrid Charles Keyworth was born on 18 February 1905; and their daughter Susannah Margaret on 14 July 1911. Galfrid co-authored various books on Venezuelan orchids with L. A. Garay. Susannah's second husband was Damiaen Joan van Doorninck, whom she met in Switzerland during the Second World War as a Resistance worker.

The force had fewer than New Zealand, British and Canadian officers and NCOs, who were drawn from the Western and Mesopotamian fronts. The force was intended to organise local units in northern Iran (Persia) and southern Caucasus, to replace the Tsarist armies that had fought the Ottoman armies in Armenia. The Russians had also occupied northern Iran in co-operation with the British occupation of south Iran, to create a cordon to prevent German and Ottoman agents from reaching central Asia, Afghanistan and India. In July 1918, Captain Stanley Savige, five officers and fifteen NCOs of Dunsterforce, set out towards Urmia and were caught up in an exodus of Assyrians, after the town had been captured by the Ottoman army. About fled and the Dunsterforce party helped hold off the Ottoman pursuit and attempts by local Kurds to get revenge on the Assyrians for their earlier plundering. By the time the rearguard reached Bijar on 17 August, the Dunsterforce party was so worn out that only four men recovered before the war ended. A combined infantry and cavalry brigade was raised from the Assyrian survivors to re-capture Urmia and the rest of the civilians were sent to refugee camps at Baqubah near Baghdad. Dunsterville and the rest of the force, with reinforcements from the 39th Infantry Brigade, drove in and armoured cars about from Hamadan across Qajar Iran to Baku. Dunsterforce fought in the Battle of Baku from 26 August to 14 September 1918 and retreated from the city on the night of to be disbanded two days later. North Persia Force (Norper Force, Major-General William Thomson) took over command of the troops in northern Iran. Troops diverted from Dunsterforce in Sweet's Column opposed an Ottoman diversion from Tabriz, on the Persian road, during September; the situation was transformed by news of the great British victory in the Battle of Megiddo in Palestine The army in Caucasus was the only source of Ottoman reinforcements and had to give up divisions, ending offensive operations in the theatre. Background =North-West Frontier= Britain and Russia had played The Great Game for influence in Central Asia from the early nineteenth century but in the 1880s, Russian absorption of the local Khanates and Emirates restricted British influence. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 ended the rivalry by defining spheres of influence in Afghanistan, Iran and Tibet. Early in the First World War, British and Indian forces set up the East Persia Cordon with Seistan Force assembled from the Indian Army. The force was created to counter German, Austrian and Ottoman subversion in Afghanistan and the North West Frontier of British India. Two squadrons of the 28th Cavalry Regiment and the locally raised South Persia Rifles patrolled the border of Baluchistan and the Persian Empire. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the collapse of the convention; the dissolution of the Tsarist armies from March 1917 left open the Caspian Sea and the route from Baku to Krasnovodsk and Central Asia to the Central Powers. In the spring of 1918, German and Ottoman forces advanced into Transcaucasia and Central Asia. =Iran= Russian policy towards Iran in 1914 was based on assurances that Iranian territorial integrity would be respected but Tsarist expansion in northern Iran and opposition to the emergence of a stable modern state, led to suspicion that its policy was really to keep Iran as a dependency or to absorb more of its northern provinces. Britain traditionally sought to maintain commercial interests in the country and the use of naval power to protect India. The geographical position of Iran, between Europe and India and the ancient west–east trade routes through Iranian provinces, had led the British in the nineteenth century to follow a policy of using Iran as a buffer state. The British in practice preferred inaction, although it enabled Russian expansionism until the Anglo-Russian Convention (Anglo-Russian Entente) of 1907. The Russian sphere ran from Meshed in the east to Tabriz in the west and as far south as Teheran and the British sphere ran west of the North-West Frontier of India and the Afghan border, west to the vicinity of Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. Only the Ottoman Empire remained as a possible field for German diplomatic and economic influence. Traditional Ottoman hostility to Iran on religious grounds meant that the Pan-Islamism of Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire failed to gain much of a following in Iran, until the Young Persians took it up as a political tool. The Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire evolved into Pan-Turanists, seeking to renew the Ottoman Empire by expanding into Trans-Caucasia, Turkestan and at least the north-west of Iran. By 1914 little attention had been paid to the Pan-Turanists, mainly due to the power of the Russian Empire; Ottoman encroachments on Iran were seen as defensive moves against Russia. In 1914, British forces from India occupied Iranian territory east of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, to guard oil concessions in Iran and in 1915 advanced up the Tigris river to Ctesiphon near Baghdad, before being defeated by the Ottoman army and forced to retreat to Kut. During the Siege of Kut the Ottomans defeated three relief attempts and refused an offer of £2,000,000 to ransom the garrison, which surrendered at the end of April. Hopes of a Russian relief force from the Caspian Sea through Kermanshah and Kanikin to Baghdad failed to materialise. From May–November 1916, the British consolidated a hold on Ottoman territory to the west of Iran around Basra and the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris at the head of the Persian Gulf. In 1917 the British campaign in Mesopotamia continued, with advances to Baghdad and towards the oilfields of Mosul as the campaign in the Levant led to the occupation of Palestine. A Russian invasion of 1915 from Caucasus established bases at Resht, Kazvin and Teheran and led to inconclusive operations between the Russians and Ottomans further west, closer to the Iranian–Ottoman border. =Caucasia= In January 1915, the British Cabinet had canvassed possible diversionary attacks against the Ottoman Empire after appeals for support from the Russian Empire. The British planned operations against the Ottoman Empire in the Aegean Sea, eastern Mediterranean and a land invasion of the Levant from Egypt, combined with a Russian invasion from Caucasus towards Anatolia and Mesopotamia. In 1917, the Eastern Committee of the War Cabinet considered that British India had been drained of troops and decided to avoid committing more troops to Iran from Europe, by sending a mission of picked men to train local recruits at Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the capital of Georgia. The War Office undertook to send officers and to organise local forces and replace the Russian Caucasus Army. Another force was to be raised in north-western Iran by Lieutenant-General W. R. Marshall, commander of the III (Indian) Corps of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force (MEF, Lieutenant-General Frederick Stanley Maude); the French took responsibility for the area north of Caucasus. In Armenia, the local Christians had been sympathetic to the Russians and feared that a revival of Ottoman power would lead to more atrocities. It was believed in London that they would be willing recruits and that some Russian soldiers in the region might fight on for pay, despite the Russian Revolution. On 13 April 1918, the Baku Soviet Commune, a Bolshevik and Left Socialist Revolutionary (SR) faction led by Stepan Shahumyan, was established in Baku, having overthrown the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. On 26 July, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship, an anti-Soviet alliance of Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaks), overthrew the Baku Commune in a bloodless coup. All the factions involved tried to gain support from about and Austro-Hungarian former prisoners of war. Those men willing to fight tended to be sympathetic to the Bolsheviks based in Astrakhan and at Tashkent, the terminus of the Trans-Caspian railway (Central Asian Railway). German and Ottoman armies in eastern Ukraine and Caucasus sent troops and diplomatic missions to Baku and further afield. By September 1918, the Ottoman force in Caucasus was the Eastern Army Group with the 3rd Army, comprising the 3rd Division, 10th Division and the 36th Caucasian Division, the 9th Army with the 9th Division, 11th Caucasian Division, 12th Division and the Independent Cavalry Brigade and the Army of Islam, with the 5th Caucasian Division and the 15th Division. Prelude =Raising of Dunsterforce= Dunsterforce was formed in December 1917, to organise local replacements for the Russian Caucasus Army, that had collapsed in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the Bolshevik October Revolution in the Gregorian calendar) and the Armistice of 15 December. If the new force managed to pass the Persian road from Baghdad to the Caspian Sea and through Baku to Tiflis, it might be impossible to keep the route open and so men of dash and intelligence were sought. About and were raised by quota from the various national and Dominion contingents in France, the largest number coming from the Australians. From and about twenty NCOs each, was requested from the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and the Canadian Corps, twelve officers and about ten NCOs from the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and several South Africans. The Canadians sent and of to London by 13 January 1918. Until the \\"Hush-Hush Party\\" sailed for the Middle East on 29 January, the War Office kept the men incognito at the Tower of London, with no knowledge of their destination. Eleven Russians and an Iranian accompanied the party and in Egypt, another quota of twenty officers and forty NCOs joined from the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, the group arriving in Basra on 4 March. The force moved up the Tigris to Baghdad by 28 March and began training, having already begun learning Russian and Iranian on the voyage. =Dunsterville Mission= The commander of Dunsterforce, Major- General L. C. Dunsterville, had arrived in Baghdad from India, with his staff and the quota of officers and NCOs drawn from India and Mesopotamia on 18 January, carrying orders to proceed to Tiflis, as the British representative to the Trans-Caucasian Government. The MEF had occupied Baghdad since March 1917 and Marshall, who had taken over the MEF after Maude died in November 1917, sent parties forward to guard the section of the Persian road vacated by the Russian army. Marshall had severe doubts about Dunsterforce, calling it a \\"mad enterprise\\" concocted by the War Cabinet against an imagined threat, which would obstruct the main campaign in Mesopotamia. Dunsterville, on arrival at Baghdad, decided that due to the unsettled conditions in the region, he should confer urgently with the British representatives in Tiflis. On 27 January, Dunsterville had set off with eleven officers, four NCOs, four batmen, two clerks and in Ford cars and vans, through the advanced parties of the MEF guarding the road. The decline of the Russian Army led the Ottomans to advance towards the Caspian Sea, where the Germans and Ottomans intended to capture Baku. Internal disagreements made their progress very slow and in the south after April, Armenians, Assyrians and some Russian troops, managed to stop the advance near Urmia in north-west Iran, about from the Persian road. Iran was politically unstable and agents of the Central Powers attempted to exacerbate British problems in India; Dunsterforce intended to be an extension of the \\"cordon\\" in Iran, intended to prevent the unrest spreading to India. From the British railhead in Mesopotamia to the Caspian shore was about and the motor-column passed through the last British outpost at Pai Tak (also Pai Taq), then drove through Kermanshah on, Hamadan and then Kazvin further, to the Elburz mountains, over the Bulagh Pass and into the jungle lowlands of Gilan Province, home of the Jungle Movement of Gilan (Jangali) led by Kuchik Khan Around Resht and Bandar-e Anzali on the Caspian coast, German and Austrian agents had established a measure of influence with the Jangali. Dunsterville discovered that thousands of Russian troops, formerly part of the occupation force in northern Iran, under General Nikolai Baratov, were being allowed free passage and on 17 February, the Dunsterville party reached Bandar-e Anzali. After contemplating the hijack of a ship to run the gauntlet of Bolshevik-operated coastal craft, Dunsterville decided not to risk alienating local opinion and turned back, intending to meet the party en route from Europe and make arrangements in Iran, while waiting for another chance to reach Tiflis. On 20 February, the party dodged the local authorities and returned to Hamadan, where it could use MEF and Russian army wireless stations, to keep in touch with Baghdad. It had become clear that there was little chance that the Russians formerly under Baratov could be induced to remain on service and that only Colonel Lazar Bicherakov and some of his Cossacks were willing to continue. On 11 February, Bicherakov flew to Baghdad and told Marshall that the Cossacks were willing to act as rearguard for the Russians before leaving and that the Tiflis initiative was doomed to failure. Marshall wanted an advance on Mosul to protect the Persian road but was over- ruled, in preference for operations in Palestine and at Hamadan, Dunsterville claimed that the Iranian public welcomed British protection and requested that he might wait at Hamadan to try again. To gain the support of the Iranian public, Dunsterville made an effort to relieve the famine, caused partly by a drought and partly by Russian and Ottoman military operations in north-west Iran. The Dunsterville Mission had plenty of money and recruited local labour to repair roads. By a ruse, Dunsterville got the local grain merchants, mostly supporters of the Democratic Party and in the pay of the Germans, to stop hoarding, which proved very popular. The Democrats retaliated by claiming that the British had poisoned the wheat and sniped at the British in Hamadan but public support for the British increased as the famine relief measures took effect. The Dunsterville Mission was also able to establish an intelligence organisation that saw all telegrams and letters concerning the mission. After the Bicherakov Cossack detachment moved from Kermanshah to Kazvin and blocked the Jangalis from using the Teheran road, the mission was able to arrest the passage of German and Ottoman agents with local levies of Christian Assyrians for local order and security duties. The prisoners were guarded a party of the 1/4th Hampshire and the \\"Irregulars\\", a military force was raised from the hill peoples of the north-west closer to the Ottoman border, to oppose an Ottoman move against the Persian road from Armenia. Baratov sold Dunsterville most of the weapons and supplies of the Russian Army but some were also traded by Russian soldiers to the Persian locals and the Kurdish hill peoples, leaving them exceptionally well armed. By the end of March, all but the Bicherakov Cossack detachment at Kazvin had withdrawn and the MEF extended its hold on the road to Kermanshah, with the 36th Brigade. Dunsterville borrowed some infantry and cavalry and Bicherakov agreed to remain at Kazvin, until British troops could take over. Twenty officers and twenty NCOs of Dunsterforce arrived by Ford car on 3 April, the rest of the force making their way on foot with a mule train, all arriving by 25 May. By the time that the rest of Dunsterforce had arrived, the local and international situation had changed; the success of the German spring offensive in France leading the Georgians to bid for German support; in May the Germans took over part of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Ottomans repudiated the treaty of Brest Litovsk and began to organise Tartars into the Islamic Army of the Caucasus on 25 May, to attack Baku and Iran, making a British move to Tiflis even less likely. The Bolsheviks asked for British assistance to reorganise the Black Sea Fleet and it appeared possible that a rapprochement with the Bolsheviks and the Armenians could be arranged, in return for British protection of Baku. Control of the port and shipping on the Caspian Sea might still achieve British and Allied objectives, despite the Ottoman push eastwards into the vacuum left by the decline of the Tsarist army. The War Office and the British command in India considered that the good campaigning weather of a Caucasian summer should be exploited by augmenting Dunsterforce as much as possible. Operations on the Euphrates by the 15th Indian Division of the MEF, surrounded an Ottoman force in the Action of Khan Baghdadi and took In April, the 2nd Ottoman Division was forced back from the Persian road, after which the MEF advanced into Kurdistan and tried to block the Ottoman retreat towards Kirkuk. Marshall was ordered to advance to Kirkuk, to divert Ottoman forces from their advance through Armenia to the Caspian Sea. The MEF took the town unopposed on 7 May, then retired to Tuz Khormato and Kifiri, due a shortage of troops and supplies. The War Office urged Marshall to send a brigade to Dunsterville but he claimed that mounted in Fords and a force of armoured cars, would be sufficient to get beyond Kermanshah. The force could to the Caspian Sea by June and then the waters could be controlled by arming ships; if he was wrong, reinforcements could be sent later. During the discussions, the Bolsheviks in Caucasus requested that Bicherakov attack the Jangalis to protect Baku, to which he agreed, in return for their acquiescence in British involvement. Dunsterville wanted to depart on 30 May but was delayed by the War Office until 1 June and allowed to move on, provided that the road was adequately guarded. Ottoman forces were west of the road at Tabriz and the Jangalis held the road at Manjil. Just after the fourth party of Dunsterforce had arrived, Dunsterville sent parties of his Officers and NCOs with pack-wireless stations, to Zenjan and Bijar, about north-west of Kazvin and Hamadan. Their objective was to recruit local Kurds, to bar the two tracks through Kurdistan against an Ottoman advance. Sehneh, on a southern track from Urmia to Kermanshah, was left until July, when Marshall sent troops to occupy the town. Operations =Dunsterforce= The Dunsterforce parties moved off via Zenjan, with their destinations secret until they were on their way, just after the fourth group of Dunsterforce arrived. Soon after the party for Zenjan arrived it was sent on another to Mianeh about from Tabriz and the Bijar party pressed on, using a track last reported on by British intelligence in 1842, arriving on 18 June. The Ottoman advance further north on Baku, was opposed by about and Bolshevik troops with about and pieces. Dunsterville proposed to reconnoitre, regardless of the reluctance of the Russian Bolshevik government to allow British interference. On 12 June, the Bicherakov Cossacks advanced from Kazvin and defeated the Jangai at Manjil bridge, reaching Bandar-e Anzali a few days later. Bicherakov took ship for Baku, styled himself a Bolshevik, was appointed commander of the Red Army in Caucasus, then returned to Bandar-e Anzali. In June, the Malleson mission, an Indian Army force under General Wilfrid Malleson, established a base to the east of Bandar e-Anzali in Mashhad, to counter German and Ottoman encroachments in Transcaspia (now Turkmenistan). Dunsterville was in contact with the Armenian National Council in Baku and urged Marshall in Mesopotamia to send infantry and artillery but Marshall refused and in June sent only the already promised, two companies each of the 1st/4th Hampshire and 1st/2nd Gurkhas, two mountain guns of the 21st Battery and supplies in the vans; the troops took over guarding the road up to Resht. The War Office and the War Cabinet questioned Marshall's judgement and asked Dunsterville directly, what it would take to control the Caspian Sea and destroy the oilfields. Dunsterville urged a forward policy but not the sabotage of the oil as this was inimical to the interests of the populations he was trying to recruit against the Ottomans. Marshall then offered the 39th Infantry Brigade of the 13th (Western) Division and artillery, provided that it could be supplied locally. (The brigade was detached on 1 July and set off in stages from the Brigade HQ arriving five days later.) Along with training and leadership, Dunsterforce was to occupy the Baku oil fields, to deny oil and the local cotton crop to the Germans and Ottomans. Dunsterforce was to operate against the Ottomans in the west and hold a line from Batum to Tiflis, Baku and Krasnovodsk (on the opposite side of the Caspian Sea) to Afghanistan. Bicherakov and the Cossacks left for Baku and were replaced by British troops at Bandar e-Anzali, as Dunsterville waited for news from Baku of the local factions and changes in their views about British involvement. Although Dunsterville and the British consul at Baku wanted to conciliate the Bolsheviks at Bandar e-Anzali, the War Cabinet wanted him to suppress them but communication was difficult, with the Bolsheviks in control of the transmitter at the port. On 25 July about attacked the British garrison of at Resht and were repulsed; ten days later, Dunsterville gained proof of Bolshevik involvement, arrested the committee in Bandar e-Anzali, seized the wireless and installed Australian signallers. At Baku the situation had changed when the Ottoman advance on the oilfields began. Bicherakov and the Cossacks, with help from four Dunsterforce armoured cars, tried to stop the advance but the local troops ran away. Also on 25 July, Bicherakoff and a few British officers with the four Dunsterforce armoured cars, staged another coup d'état in Baku. A Centrocaspian Dictatorship was installed, Bicherakoff appealed for British aid and sent ships to Bandar-e Anzali to pick up the first troops. Dunsterville sent his intelligence officer, Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Stokes and all the available to Baku, with news that the brigade and artillery he had requested were on the way. =Urmia Crisis= In 1918, Urmia was defended by Christian (Nestorian) Assyrians of the Urmia villages, that had endured a siege by local Muslim rivals, until the Russian army reached Urmia in May 1915. About Assyrians from the Hakkiari Mountains south of Lake Van, declared war on the Ottomans in 1915 and then retreated towards the Russians, when they were unable to break through. These refugees settled at Salmas, north of Urmia and attacked the local population, who began to call them Jelus. After the Russian armies collapsed, the Ottomans drove another from around Lake Van, who joined the earlier fugitives. Tsarist officers reorganised the two groups defending Salmas until June, when they retreated to the group at Urmia. A British officer had been sent from Tiflis with offers of organisation and help but the assurances were not honoured, which reduced British prestige. A local teacher-turned-general, Agha Petros, managed to unite the three factions and repulse fourteen Ottoman attacks. On 8 July, before Dunsterforce set off for Baku, Lieutenant K. M. Pennington flew to the Jelus at Urmia, who were under siege by the 5th Ottoman Division and the 6th Ottoman Division of the Ottoman army. Dunsterville offered to send money, machine-guns and ammunition north from Bijar, if Petross pushed a force through the Ottoman siege lines around Lake Urmia, to meet the column and escort it in. The column departed from Bijar on 19 July, commanded by Major J. C. More, carrying £45,000 in Iranian silver Dinar, twelve Lewis guns and of ammunition, accompanied by Captain Stanley Savige, five Dunsterforce officers and fifteen NCOs, escorted by a squadron of the 14th (King's) Hussars (Colonel Bridges). The British reached the rendezvous at Sain Kala on 23 July as arranged but there was no reception party waiting. After a couple of days, Bridges decided that he must return before the grain supply for the horses ran out. Savige and the Dunsterforce party got permission to go on alone, when the column had retired to Takan Tepe, where his party and the convoy was allowed to remain, with a squadron of cavalry. Savige judged that the Assyrians could still reach them and in the meantime, they would raise a local force to get to Urmia if necessary. Recruitment began and on 1 August, news arrived of a battle south of Lake Urmia, that Savige took to be the Assyrian break-out attempt and the party moved north the next day. Aga Petros and the Assyrians arrived on 3 August and next day the march to Urmia began; at dusk near Sain Kala, Petros was aghast to see Assyrian women on the road. The Ottomans had captured Urmia in his absence and the had fled. On 5 August, the British saw a multitude on the road from Urmia, who said that the far end was some miles back, with a rear-guard commanded by Dr W. A. Shedd an American missionary, trying to protect the refugees from local Kurdish and Iranian attacks. The Dunsterforce party went to join the rearguard, while the cavalry protected the main body. A hundred men promised by Petros had already gone to find their families, when the rearguard moved at dawn on 6 August. The Savige party (two officers and six NCOs), found the tail of the refugee column up the road, with Mrs Shedd encouraging wounded refugees to keep going and the Doctor and men on a ridge, waiting for the next attack. Savige took over the refugee guard and pressed on about to a village that was being looted by local mounted irregulars. Savige and his exiguous force forced the horsemen out of the village and held them off until later the next day and then retreated, finding that the Assyrians had pillaged the villages in the past, as ruthlessly as the survivors had been taking reprisals against them as they fled from Urmia. Soon after dawn the next day, advanced down the road and others moved past on the flanks. Savige and the party hurried back to a ridge behind a village and commenced a rear-guard action with some of the refugees, while the others ran away. Many well-armed Assyrians pushed to the head of the column, seizing the best horses and leaving women and children to the bandits; having fought in the defence of Urmia, Petros lost control of them once they were under British protection. During the first day, Savige and a local leader got several Assyrians (at gunpoint) to charge the pursuers, as a message was got back to the Hussars asking for support. After seven hours of fighting, having been pressed back to the tail of the column, twelve British cavalry appeared on the next ridge back, having heard of the request for help and arriving just in time, as the rearguard was exhausted. The cavalry held off the attackers and then fifty men sent by Aga Petros arrived and relieved Savige and the Dunsterforce party. Dr Shedd reached the British encampment but during the night died of cholera and was buried nearby. Attacks on the refugee column by Ottoman troops and local Kurds diminished but for the rest of the march there were frequent attempts to take loot and rustle cattle before the escort could intervene. The cavalry guarded the money and the Dunsterville party provided the rearguard but was not able to protect wounded or exhausted women and children, who had been abandoned by their men, from being murdered. Short of Bijar, an attack by hillmen was deterred, by a show of force by Agha Petros and on 17 August, the rearguard entered Bijar, by when the Dunsterforce members were so worn out that only four regained their fitness before the end of the war. Of about who fled from Urmia, perhaps the Persian road. Urmia Brigade At Bijar, Lieutenant-Colonel McCarthy tried with Agha Petros to recruit from the Assyrians a force to recapture Urmia but found that the best men were leading the retreat and would not stop. McCarthy returned to Hamadan ready to stop them with machine-guns if necessary and the best men were press- ganged at bayonet-point by a platoon of the 1st/4th Hampshire. The \\"recruits\\" were formed at Abshineh, into the Urmia Brigade (Major G. S. Henderson) of and , trained and commanded through a small Dunsterforce detachment. The remaining Assyrians were sent on to a refugee camp at Baqubah near Baghdad and the Dunsterforce personnel attempted to prevent the Assyrians from getting into Baghdad and plundering local Iranians. The Dunsterforce officers and NCOs were unscrupulous, using training methods like \\"young sheepdogs practising on the fowls\\" but had made little progress, when two of the new battalions were sent to counter the threat of an Ottoman advance towards the Persian road; the third battalion moved to Bijar in October. (Eventually the Urmia Brigade returned to Mesopotamia to prepare to recapture Urmia, when the armistice made the attempt unnecessary and the brigade disbanded) =Baku= Baku was attacked on 29 July and again the local troops ran away, leaving the Bicherakov Cossacks in the lurch. On 31 July, the Ottomans attacked Hill 905 north-west of Baku at and continued until 2 August. The 10th Caucasian Infantry Division, the 51st Infantry Division, several batteries of artillery and a cavalry regiment arrived but another attack on 5 August failed, with casualties. The 10th Caucasian Infantry Division was withdrawn to rest and the 15th Infantry Division took over. When the Ottomans were about from the docks, Bicherakov decided to retreat to Derbent, up the coast but the Ottomans were unaccountably seized by panic and retreated, which encouraged the Armenians to counter-attack, until the Ottomans rallied about outside town. Dunsterville also obtained the steamships President Kruger, Kursk and Argo, to be held ready for a hurried retreat. Fears about the British line of communications were reduced, when the Jangali leader Kuchik Khan made terms on 12 August, which included supplying the British forces. Every spare man of Dunsterforce began the task of training the Armenian and Russian troops at Baku into an army. There were in 23 battalions that were commanded by five political organisations. The troops held a defensive perimeter across the Baku peninsula about long, the last in the south running along cliffs and the rest on low ground including a salt lake. From the salt lake to the cliffs lies a hill known as Dirty Volcano, that was the most important defensive feature on the right flank. On 18 August, Dunsterville and two more battalions reached Baku but at the end of the month, troops intended for Baku had to be diverted to Bijar, against another Ottoman attack from Tabriz, which threatened to cut the lines of communication to Bandar-e Anzali. As parties of the 39th Infantry Brigade arrived at Baku, they took over parts of the defence, particularly at Dirty Volcano and the left flank. Even when the rest of Dunsterforce had arrived from Mesopotamia in the Ford vans and joined in the defence of the city, there were only just over and one artillery battery, against about who had already captured villages behind the right flank. Without the support of local troops, Dunsterforce could not defend Baku and so the locals were reorganised into brigades of three Baku battalions, each with Dunsterforce advisers and one British battalion. Dunsterville had ordered two Martinsyde Elephants of 72 Squadron RAF to Baku, to encourage the population and on 18 August, the aeroplanes flew from Kazvin to Bandar-e Anzali. The aircraft flew on to Baku and by 20 August, the Martinsydes were ready for operations. The Armenians attempted bravado but during Ottoman attacks, tended to hang back or melt away; a Bolshevik crew of a ship reported to Dunsterville that, On 26 August, the Ottomans captured Dirty Volcano and inflicted many casualties on the British battalion. The British repulsed the Ottomans four times but the local troops melted away; a Canadian captain commanding an Armenian battalion suddenly found himself alone and the fifth attack succeeded. In another attack on 31 August, a Russian battalion joined in and assisted the British during a retirement but Dunsterville threatened the Baku authorities, that he would order more withdrawals of British troops, rather than leave them to be killed. Next day he told the Dictators that he would evacuate Baku that night, at which the Dictators replied that the British could only go after women and children had left and at the same time as the local troops; Russian gunboats were ordered to fire on the British if their ships tried to leave. Dunsterville took no notice but had second thoughts and the situation improved, when Bicherakov sent reinforcements, with a promise of in two weeks. A Russian settlement at Lankaran south of Baku, where Dunsterville had sent Lieutenant-Colonel A. Rawlinson and some Dunsterforce personnel, to raise a force of for raids on Ottoman communications. In early September, an evacuation was considered and the War Office agreed with Marshall, that British troops should be withdrawn. The Ottoman success had been costly and it was only after the arrival of reinforcements that the attack could be resumed on 14 September, a plan disclosed to the defenders by a deserter on 12 September. The Ottoman plan for the final assault on Baku, was for the 15th Infantry Division to attack from the north and the 5th Caucasian Infantry Division to attack from the west, with the main attack on the north-west corner of the Baku defence line. The attack began at along a road through Wolf's Gap in the ridge. In clouds and mist, the two British pilots strafed the Ottoman troops on the western slopes from low altitude and reported the progress of the attack. By the Ottomans were half-way from the ridge to the city and at the pilots were ordered to destroy the aircraft, since they were too badly damaged to risk flying. The RAF contingent abandoned the airfield under artillery fire, the pilots took a machine-gun, salvaged three cameras and the ground crews took another machine-gun and joined the infantry defending the north end of the field. With the Ottomans able to bombard the port and shipping with observed artillery-fire, Marshall ordered Dunsterforce to leave. Ships had been readied at the docks and evacuation took place on the night of in two ships. The Dictators changed their minds but behind a rearguard of the 7th North Staffordshire, the men guns and equipment were loaded. A crewmember managed to turn on the lights of Dunsterville's ship, that was fired on by the port guardship and hit the Armenian six times (the Dunsterforce passengers holding up the crew at gunpoint) as the ships ran for Bandar e-Anzali and arrived with no more casualties. Two Australians who were stranded managed to leave on a refugee ship to Krasnovodsk. With the withdrawal of the British, order broke down among the civilian Azeris, Cossacks and Armenian refugees and as the remaining defences were overrun, fires, pillaging and atrocities began. The Ottoman bombardment continued through the night and by dawn up to many of them civilians, had been killed in reprisal by Azeri irregulars; there had been about casualties. The retreat from Baku left the Dunsterforce troops and Australian wireless operators in Lankaran isolated among an aggrieved public and the force had to repel an attack by Tartar irregulars, before running for Bandar e-Anzali in a stolen lorry on 18 October. Tabriz The main Ottoman effort at Baku was assisted by operations on the southern flank, where the 9th Army began an invasion of Iran with six divisions, to capture Tabriz. In late June 1918, two divisions had to be withdrawn but the 12th Division attacked southwards and captured Dilman on 18 June; by 27 July the division had reached Urmia. In late August the advance passed beyond Lake Urmia and to the north, two more Ottoman divisions by-passed Yerevan and went straight toward Nahcivan, which was captured on 19 July. The 11th Division advanced along the railway and captured Tabriz on 23 August, then a force of about advanced on 5 September and drove back Dunsterforce outposts beyond Mianeh and occupied the town, then pressed on to the Persian road near Kazvin. The 39th Infantry Brigade elements diverted from Dunsterforce at Baku to Bijar in August, were organised into Sweet's Column (Lieutenant-Colonel E. H. Sweet) and set off from Hamadan to Zenjan on 14 September, accompanied by an Australian wireless team. The British reinforcements were able to prevent the 9th Army from advancing further and in September, the Ottomans consolidated a line in northern Iran, from Astara on the Caspian Sea south of Baku, to Mianeh in Iran about to the south-east of Tabriz, thence to Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan. Aftermath =Analysis= The Centrocaspian Dictatorship fell on 15 September, after Ottoman-Azerbaijani forces occupied Baku. In 1937, the RAF official historian, H. A. Jones wrote that Dunsterforce had failed to reach Tiflis or to create a Caucasian military force to hold the line between Batum, Tiflis and Baku but the cotton crop and the oil of Baku had been denied to the Germans. The Ottomans took over the oil fields in September, though only for a few weeks. On 30 October, the armistice with the Ottoman Empire required them to leave and allow the Allies to re-occupy Baku. Exaggerated rumours about the strength of Dunsterforce had also tied down Ottoman troops in Kurdistan, protecting the British flank in Mesopotamia. In the same year, Charles Bean, the Australian official historian, wrote that after Dunsterforce was disbanded, the officers were allowed to return to their former units, join Indian battalions or stay with Norperforce. The Dunsterville Mission had failed in its original purpose but managed to stop the agents of the Central powers getting into Iran. The obstruction of the Jungle Movement of Gilan (Jangali) was achieved by Bicherakov but this would have not occurred without the rapport with him that was established by Dunsterville. The operations of Dunsterforce gave the British great local prestige as the rest of the Dunsterville Mission carried out famine relief and the organisation of supplies, for which it had little local knowledge but the force adapted and also displayed its military quality in the fighting at Sain Kala and Baku. In 1987, Vasili Mitrokhin, a Soviet archivist, wrote that the real objective of Dunsterforce, in the guise of defending British India, was to secure a foothold in the Caucasus. The force would then co-operate with counter-revolutionary forces, to overthrow the Baku Soviet and seize control of Caucasus and the Caspian Sea region. Mitrokhin claimed that General Dunsterville had \\"forty Ford Model T vans loaded with gold and silver\\" to pay for the operation. =Casualties= One Canadian member of Dunsterforce was wounded. Ottoman forces in Iran in 1918 lost about killed and and in Armenia and Azerbaijan lost about killed and =Subsequent operations= After the Allied victory at the Battle of Dobro Pole near Salonika and the British victory at the Battle of Megiddo , the army in Caucasus was the only source for Ottoman reinforcements and had to give up more and more divisions, that eventually ended offensive operations in the theatre. After resting, the Ottoman army in Caucasus advanced with the 15th Division northwards along the Caspian coast to Derbent but were held up on 7 October by troops supported by naval gunfire from the Bolshevik fleet. The Ottomans attacked again from and the 15th Division reached Petrovsk on 28 October. After several attacks the city fell on 8 November, in the last Ottoman offensive operation of the war and marked the northern limit of the Ottoman advance into the Caucasus Mountains. On 17 September, Dunsterforce had been disbanded and North Persia Force (Major-General W. M. Thomson) took over the command of the troops in the area. The Dunsterforce officers were allowed to choose to return to their regiments, join Indian battalions or stay on in Norperforce. Marshall was told by the War Office on 2 October, that an Ottoman request for an armistice was anticipated and he was to take as much ground as possible up the Tigris, to assist the British in Syria to advance on Aleppo. Marshall planned a advance up the Tigris, despite most of the transport being in Iran, making an advance to Aleppo out of the question. The advance began after the Ottoman armistice request and the Ottoman troops began a withdrawal on 24 October, until the Tigris Group (Dicle Grubu) of the 6th Army was surrounded and forced to surrender on 29 October, at the Battle of Sharqat (23–30 October). A flying column pushed on but was met south of Mosul by an Ottoman delegation on 1 November, with the news that the armistice had come into force the day before and the town was occupied on 10 November. Far to the north, the North Persia Force and the Bicherakov Cossacks re-entered Baku on 17 November. The Bolshevik regime eventually defeated its enemies in Central Asia in 1921 but local operations continued against Basmachi irregulars for years afterwards. British intervention had been part of a wider attempt by the British, French, Americans and Japanese to prevent military bases and Allied war material at ports falling into the hands of the Central Powers. At first the Allies were encouraged by the Bolshevik regime but in the summer of 1918, the Allies began intriguing with the internal enemies of the Bolsheviks, which soured relations with the USSR for decades.

Towngas shop in Kornhill Plaza The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited, doing business as Towngas, is the sole provider of towngas in Hong Kong. Founded in 1862, it is one of the oldest listed companies in the territory. History In February 1862, the concession to supply gas to the city of Victoria (the centre of which now referred to as Central), was obtained from then governor Sir Hercules Robinson by William Glen, a newcomer to the gas industry. p. 221 Incorporation took place on 3 June 1862 and, by 3 December 1864 that year, there were of pipes and 500 gas lamps along Queen's Road and Upper Valley Road. Across the harbour, residents in Kowloon continued to rely on candles and oil lamps until gas was laid on 28 years later. The company's original generating plant, the first in Asia, stood on the waterfront at West Point near Whitty Street and provided gas for lighting to government offices and army barracks as well as Jardine's offices, the Hong Kong Dispensary and the Hong Kong Hotel. The plant was coal fired and produced of gas per day. It was run directly from Britain until 1954 when a majority shareholding was purchased by local firm Wheelock and Marden Company Limited who moved the company's registered domicile from the UK to Hong Kong. As of 2011, the only surviving four gas lamps installed by the company are situated at the top and bottom of a flight of broad granite steps linking Ice House Street and Duddell Street. These are still maintained by Towngas, while the site is one of the Declared monuments of Hong Kong. Gas production and network The company imports natural gas from Australia by sea and stores it at the Dapeng liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Shenzhen under a 25-year contract. A submarine pipeline connects the Dapeng terminal to Towngas' Tai Po plant. The Tai Po plant produces 97% of its town gas output while the remaining 3% is produced at the Ma Tau Kok plant. The two plants cover 1.8 million households via a network of more than of pipelines throughout Hong Kong. Treated gas from landfill sites is also utilised as fuel to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. In Hong Kong, town gas is produced from naphtha and natural gas. Its major components are hydrogen (49%), methane (28.5%), carbon dioxide (19.5%) and a small amount of carbon monoxide (3%). It supplies towngas to 85% Hong Kong households, and also to commercial and industrial customers. It has over 200 projects in mainland China including city-gas, water supply, emerging environmentally-friendly energy and telecommunications. Property development The company also engages in property development projects. It has a 15% share in the International Finance Centre and 50% share in Grand Promenade, both in Hong Kong, as well as the Grand Waterfront. All are investments in conjunction with the company's largest shareholder. Usurpation by ultimate parent On 3 October 2007, Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd (HLD) proposed to pay market value only to gain control of Towngas. The 39.06 percent stake in Towngas held by subsidiary Henderson Investment was valued at HK$42.86 billion in cash and convertible notes for the purposes of the transaction. Minority shareholders of Henderson Investment, who together held 30.73%, would receive 204.1 million Henderson Land shares and HK$1.19 billion in cash. The offer was considered by analysts to be favourable to the Company, though shareholder activist David Webb criticised the deal saying Henderson was acquiring the stake on the cheap, without paying any control premium to minority shareholders of Henderson Investment. Webb further criticised the nature of the offer as a back-door privatisation of Henderson Investment, which would virtually be a shell company after the transfer of the stake. On 7 November, Henderson sweetened the offer to appease minority shareholders by increasing the cash portion to HK$2.24 per share.Victor Cheung, \\"Henderson Land all set to take over Towngas\\" , The Standard, 9 November 2007 On 7 December 2007, Henderson secured shareholders' support for the usurpation.Victor Cheung, Henderson Land gets control of Towngas , The Standard, 8 December 2007 As of 31 December 2014, HLD was the company's largest shareholder, owning 41.51% of the issued shares of the company. Lee Shau Kee, chairman of HLD, is also the chairman of the company. Exploration operations Towngas in 2008 agreed to a joint venture with Sunpec and Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum to develop block 3113 in Madagascar with technical assistance from Yunnan Kaiyuan Oil and Gas. The venture discovered light oil in November 2009. This block along with block 2104 has estimated oil reserves of 5.6 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 66 billion cubic metres.

It is located in the Valdinievole, and is a popular spa resort. It is composed of two separate nuclei: Monsummano Alto, of Etruscan origins and with a castle (probably of Lombard origins) and a line of walls, overlook the lower Monsummano, built starting from 1602 around a sanctuary commissioned by Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany. It was the birthplace of French actor Yves Montand and Italian poet Giuseppe Giusti. Geography The district is located in the central-eastern Valdinievole, and is bordered to the north by the hills of Montalbano, to the south by the wetland Padule di Fucecchio, to the west by the Piana di Lucca, and to the east by the semi-hilly areas the town of Larciano. Given the proximity to the Padule, the area displays a wealth of flora and fauna and is a meeting place for birdwatchers. The rivers are very short, of which the Candalla stream is the most prominent, flowing through the city center. The mountains are formed from the Montalbano chain, in which Vinci is located, and Monsummano Alto, which is , known for the unmistakable shape for its quarries, now disused, which have given unnaturally steep slopes on the mountain. History In Etruscan and Roman times, the Valdinievole was classified as a transit site, with some sacred resting places, as evidenced by a bronze piece of art from the 3rd century BC promachos of Hercules, found in 1887 at Castelmartini and today can be found at the city's museum. Going back to the Roman archeological sites (Villa San Paolo at Pozzarello, Vaiano and Segalare), on the slopes of Monte Albano. The settlement of the castle of Monsummano Alto is documented from 1260, but probably existed since the previous century, or, as some have suggested due to the topology from the Lombard era. The castle was at the center of battles between Florence and Lucca, with its final conquest in 1331. The flat area was swampy (which can still be seen today through the Fucecchio Padule, close by), which became a human settlement in the second half of the 16th century with the construction of several farms and houses. The lower section of the town dates mainly to the seventeenth century, when, after the miraculous apparition of the Virgin on 9 June 1573, the Grand Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany started the construction of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fontenuova (1602-1605) as well as other buildings for the reception of pilgrims, such as Osteria dei Pellegrini, now the city's Museum. During the 19th century Monsummano Terme was home of writer and politician Ferdinando Martini (his villa is now the headquarters of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Twentieth Century) and of the patriotic poet Giuseppe Giusti. His birthplace and a memorial at the center of the square have both become dedicated to him. The monument also symbolizes his distaste for the clergy, showing the poet facing way from the church. The city, after a flow emigration with the advent of Fascism, became a place of immigration in the years 1951-61, mainly from southern Italy, passing rapidly from 9,708 residents (in 1,951) to 11,631 (1961), due to the footwear sectors rise. Main sights  Monsummano, as well as being the center of one of the most important Italian footwear districts in the past (from the 1920s and even parts of the 19th century), is a spa town with two natural caves: Grotta Giusti and Grotta Parlanti, the latter recently undergoing renovation following the closure. Tower of the di Monsummano Alto castle. Entrance to the Grotta Giusti spa. Other sights include: *The medieval castle and fortifications. The elliptical shape have led to suppose a Lombard origin, but the castle is mentioned for the first time in the 11th century. It was occupied by the Florentines in 1314, but was recaptured one year later by Castruccio Castracani after the battle of Montecatini. Florence recaptured it in 1331. Of the castle today several gates and long stretches of the walls, partly covered by vegetation, as well as a single tower, remain. *Church of San Nicolao (12th century), included in the castle. It houses a 14th- to 15th- century wooden crucifix. *Sanctuary of Maria Santissima della Fontenuova (17th century). This sanctuary was built in 1602 by the Grand Duke Ferdinand I De Medici and is the located at the heart of Monsummano Terme.

Name The same name - which simply means 'a farmer' in Chagatai - can be extended to agrarian populations of the Ferghana Valley and oases of the entire Central Asian Turkestan. Although the Tarim Basin (with such oases as Kashgar, Kumul, Khotan and Turpan) is the agrarian Taranchis' traditional homeland, they have during the Qing period on China, migrated to regions that are now Urumqi and Ili. Many Taranchis were encouraged to settle in the Ili valley alongside sedentary Xibe garrisons and the nomadic Kyrgyz by the Qing military governors after the conquest of the Dzungars by the Chinese. In the multiethnic Muslim culture of Xinjiang, the term Taranchi is considered contradistinctive to Sart, which denotes towns dwelling traders and craftsmen. It of course excluded the ruling classes of the oases Muslim states, often called Moghol/Mughal because of the Chagatay-Timurid dynasties or Dolan because of the Doglat nobility. However, from a modern perspective, Taranchi, Sart and Moghol Dolans cannot be considered three distinctive ethnic groups, but rather three different classes or castes in the same cultural-linguistic zone that was Chagatay-Timurid. In the early 20th century, the geopolitical Great Game between Russia and Great Britain resulted in the division of Central Asia among modern nation-states. All oases farmers native to Xinjiang became part of Uyghur nationality by 1934. While most Sarts of oases or Ili Valley towns became part of the Uyghur nationality, those with particularly strong ties to regions west of Xinjiang became Uzbeks. Sometimes such divisions are very arbitrary, because Kashgaris can be as distinctive from Turpanliks as they are from Andijanliks.  History  The Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the Chagatai Khanate while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the Dzungar Khanate. The Naqshbandi Sufi Khojas, descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the Afaq Khoja inviting the 5th Dalai Lama, the leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler. Khoja Afaq asked the 5th Dalai Lama when he fled to Lhasa to help his Afaqi faction take control of the Tarim Basin (Kashgaria).Millward 2007, p. 86. The Dzungar leader Galdan was then asked by the Dalai Lama to restore Khoja Afaq as ruler of Kashgararia.Millward 2007, p. 87. Khoja Afaq collaborated with Galdan's Dzungars when the Dzungars conquered the Tarim Basin from 1678-1680 and set up the Afaqi Khojas as puppet client rulers.Millward 2007, p. 88.ed. Starr 2004, p. 50.Kim 2008, p. 117 The Dalai Lama blessed Galdan's conquest of the Tarim Basin and Turfan Basin.Millward 2007, p. 90. 67,000 patman of grain (each patman is 4 piculs and 5 pecks, or roughly 4,800 kg + 44 litres of dry rice) and 48,000 silver ounces were required to be paid yearly by Kashgar to the Dzungars, and the rest of the cities were also taxed. Trade, milling, and distilling taxes, corvée labor, saffron, cotton, and grain were also extracted by the Dzungars from the Tarim Basin. Every harvest season, women and food had to be provided to Dzungars when they came to extract the taxes from them.Millward 2007, p. 92. When the Dzungars levied the traditional nomadic Alban poll tax upon the Muslims of Altishahr, the Muslims viewed it as the payment of jizyah (a tax traditionally taken from non-Muslims by Muslim conquerors). = Involvement of Qing dynasty China = The Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the Qing dynasty of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu Bannermen carried out the Zunghar genocide, nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759. Some Taranchis resettled to Dzungaria.Clarke 2011, p. 20. Taranchi was the name for Turki agriculturalists who were resettled in Dzungaria from the Tarim Basin oases (\\"East Turkestani cities\\") by the Qing dynasty, along with Manchus, Xibo (Xibe), Solons, Han and other ethnic groups.Millward 1998, p. 77.Millward 1998, p. 79.Perdue 2009, p. 351.Perdue 2009, p. 352.Perdue 2009, p. 339.Millward 2007, p. 118.Millward 2007, p. 93.Pollard 2011, p. 188.Walcott 2013, p. 57.Journal of the North- China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 10 1876, p. 218.Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

The Qing settled in Dzungaria even more Turki-Taranchi (Uyghurs) numbering around 12,000 families originating from Kashgar in the aftermath of the Jahangir Khoja invasion in the 1820s.Tyler 2004, p. 67. Standard Uyghur is based on the Taranchi dialect, which was chosen by the Chinese government for this role.Rudelson 1997, p. 162. Salar migrants from Amdo (Qinghai) came to settle the region as religious exiles, migrants, and as soldiers enlisted in the Chinese army to fight in Ili, often following the Hui.Dwyer 2007, p. 79.

At first, they cooperated with the Dungans, but turned on them, massacring the Dungans at Kuldja and driving the rest through Talk pass to the Ili valley.

She was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and lived with Joseph Smith and his family for a time in Nauvoo, Illinois. She traveled with her husband to Utah, spending the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters. She petitioned the First Presidency to be endowed and sealed; as a result of her requests she was adopted as a servant into the Joseph Smith family through a specially created temple ceremony. Not satisfied to be an eternal servant in the Smith family, she continued to petition to receive her own temple endowment but was denied these rites during her lifetime. She was posthumously endowed by proxy in 1979. Early life and life with Fitches Jane Elizabeth Manning James was born in Wilton, Connecticut, to Isaac Manning and Eliza Phyllis Mead. Although late in James's life her brother Isaac gave her birthday as 1813, there are source discrepancies that place her birthday anywhere from September 22, 1812, to the year 1820 or 1822 (the latter being asserted on her gravestone). The Mannings were a free family living in rural Connecticut, and Jane had at least five siblings including Isaac, Lewis, Peter, Sarah, and Angeline. At the age of six, Jane was sent away to live with the Fitches, a wealthy Caucasian family. She was raised by the Fitches' daughter and lived with them for the next thirty years. Little is known about Jane's life with the Fitches other than she worked as a servant: cooking, cleaning, and ironing, etc. While with the Fitches, Jane was also brought up as a Christian. She was baptized into the Presbyterian Church when she was about 14 years old. On March 1, 1835, Jane gave birth to a son, Sylvester. Conversion and relocation to Nauvoo In the fall of 1842, two LDS missionaries, one of whom was Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although forbidden by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she \\"had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel.\\" James was baptized into the Latter Day Saint Church the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that \\"We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground.\\" When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1844. James had several unique experiences while living with the Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to \\"bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here.\\" According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, \\"You will live long after I am dead and gone and you can tell the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim\\". Another time, Emma asked James if she would like to be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said \\"no m'am\\". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision had a significant impact on James's later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church. After Joseph Smith's assassination in 1844, James resided in Brigham Young's home. It was here where she met and married her husband, Isaac James. Isaac was born a free man and grew up in rural New Jersey. He converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1839. At the time of his baptism Isaac was 19 years old, and became one of the earliest immigrants to Nauvoo. Pioneer life in Utah When the Latter Day Saints began to migrate west in 1846, James prepared to move as well. Although many of her immediate family members, including her mother, three brothers, and two sisters, had joined the church, she was the only one who chose to move West with the main body of saints from Nauvoo. At the time of the James family's departure, she was pregnant with a second son, Silas James, who was born at Hogg Creek, Iowa in June 1846. James, her husband Isaac, and Sylvester were part of the original group of Latter Day Saints to spend the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. They were also part of the Ira Eldredge company, the first Mormon pioneer company to enter the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. At the time of their settlement in the Salt Lake Valley, they made up a third of the 12 African Americans living in Utah, and were the only ones who were free. James was the first documented African-American woman to come to the Utah Territory as a Mormon pioneer. The family's first years in the valley were difficult: they lived in poverty and often did not even have the barest essentials for survival. Nevertheless, James exhibited remarkable charity and strength of character. In 1849, Eliza Lyman, a neighbor of hers, had no food to sustain her and her children until the harvest after she sent her husband on a mission to California. She records that \\"Not long after Amasa had gone, Jane James, the colored woman, let me have two pounds of flour, it being half of what she had.\\" Despite trials, James's life in Utah was punctuated by moments of joy. A daughter, Mary Ann, was born in May 1848—the first black child born in Utah. Eventually things began to get better for the Mannings: by the mid 1860s they were able to build a comfortable home and had acquired both farmland and animals, including an ox, horses, and a small flock of sheep. By the end of 1865 the Jameses, while not wealthy, were fairly prosperous. Only four households in the area held more assets in 1865 than they did, while 31 held less. The family was growing quickly as well. Between 1848 and 1860 six children were born: Miriam, Ellen Madora, Jessie, Jerry, Isaac, and Vilate. James's oldest son, Sylvester, was listed as a member of the Nauvoo Legion in 1861. Petitions to be endowed and sealed; adoption as a servant in the Smith family Isaac James left the family in 1869 after selling most of the family's realty to his wife. There is no evidence that suggests that Isaac had any permanent relations with any members of the family again. Within four years James was remarried to her son Sylvester's father-in-law, Frank Perkins. The marriage lasted less than two years, after which time she reverted to her former married name. It was at this time that James became increasingly worried about her eternal welfare. She began to petition the First Presidency to be endowed and to be sealed, along with her children, to Walker Lewis, a prominent African-American Mormon Elder. Lewis, like Elijah Abel, had been ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime, and James therefore assumed that he would be eligible for temple ordinances. However, her petitions were consistently ignored or refused. Despite these trials, James neither renounced her faith nor gave up hope that one day she would have the blessings she desired. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, she struggled to care for the remaining children at home as a single parent. In 1872, she sold the family farm and moved closer to the city in order to save money. During these years James both managed a household of children and small grandchildren, but also worked as a domestic servant in order to make ends meet. In addition, she made the family's soap, clothing, and raised vegetables in a small garden. James remained active in the church at this time as well. She participated in the Relief Society doing extensive charitable work. She also contributed financially to the building of the Logan, Manti, and St. George temples; temples that, as an African-American, she was not allowed to enter. The members of her congregation, however, did recognize her faith and sacrifice. In her later life, both she and her brother Isaac J. Manning received reserved seats near the front and center of the Utah Tabernacle for church services. James remained a strong supporter of Joseph Smith, calling him \\"the finest man I ever saw on earth.\\" James continued to ask that she and her family be given the ordinance of adoption so that they could be sealed together forever. Her justification for asking to be the exception to the church's rule was Emma Smith's offer in 1844 to have her sealed to the Smith family as a child. James was now reconsidering her decision, and asked to be sealed to the Smiths. Her requests were again refused. Instead, the First Presidency \\"decided she might be adopted into the family of Joseph Smith as a servant, which was done, a special ceremony having been prepared for the purpose.\\" The ceremony took place on May 18, 1894, with Joseph F. Smith acting as proxy for Joseph Smith, and Bathsheba W. Smith acting as proxy for James (who was not allowed into the temple for the ordinance). In the ceremony, James was \\"attached as a Servitor for eternity to the prophet Josep[h] Smith and in this capacity . . . connected with his family[, to] be obedient to him in all things in the Lord as a faithful Servitor.\\" James was dissatisfied with that unique sealing ordinance, and applied again to obtain the sealing that was offered to her by Emma. According to the diary of Franklin Richards, the LDS First Presidency met on August 22, 1895, to consider her appeal, but again turned her down. James would petition the leaders of the church for the rest of her life, but with no success. She continued to have trials: all but two of her eight children (Sylvester & Ellen) preceded her in death, as did 6 of her 14 grandchildren. Jane Elizabeth Manning James died April 16, 1908, in Salt Lake City. Despite her circumstances, it is apparent that she died on good terms with the LDS Church. Church President Joseph F. Smith spoke at her funeral. There, he declared that she would receive all her temple blessings in the eternities and become a white and beautiful person, reflecting the Church's contemporary theology on race. According to The Deseret News, her funeral was attended by many.  Legacy  In 1979, nearly 72 years after her death, James was endowed by proxy. A 20-minute documentary based on James's life, Jane Manning James: Your Sister in the Gospel, premiered in 2005, and has been shown at This Is The Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 2005 annual conference of the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), and on public television (PBS). The film was directed by Margaret Blair Young, co-author with Darius Gray of the Standing on the Promises trilogy of historical fiction that draws on the facts of James's life. In June 1999, a monument to James's life was dedicated near her grave in the Salt Lake City Cemetery by the Genesis Group (an official organization begun under LDS President Joseph Fielding Smith to support Latter Day Saints of African descent) along with the Missouri Mormon Frontier Foundation. The original headstones of Jane and Isaac James were supplemented with a granite monument faced with two bronze plaques. One side of the monument commemorates an incident documented in 1850, by Mormon pioneer Eliza Partridge Lyman, who wrote: > April 13: Brother Lyman [Eliza's husband] started on a mission to California > with O. P Rockwell and others. May the Lord bless and prosper them and > return them in safety. He left us ... without anything to make bread, it not > being in his power to get any. > April 25: Jane James, a colored woman, let me have two pounds of flour, it > being about half she had. A second bronze plaque, containing quotations from James and significant dates and events from her life, was placed on the back of the monument. In April 2005, the graves and monument were again cleaned and sealed. The inscription on her grave marker reads: On October 12th, 2018, a feature-length film was released about James's relationship with Emma Smith, entitled \\"Jane and Emma.\\" The film was directed by Chantelle Squires, with a screenplay by Melissa Leilani Larson.

Titles The Well of Echoes consists of four books: *Geomancer *Tetrarch *Scrutator / Alchymist *Chimaera Main characters The Well of Echoes quartet centres on new characters, set in the same world as The View from the Mirror. ;Tiaan Tiaan Liise-Mar is a highly skilled artisan. She works hard to maintain her position as she knows the alternative is the breeding factory. Her mother has worked in the breeding factory in Tiksi most of her life. She also doesn't know who her father is and has no history of her family from his side which is a disadvantage on Santhenar. However, she does have some extraordinary talents. She has a photographic memory and even more rare, if she can remember the mechanical workings of a machine, she can make them move in her mind and tell whether the machine will work and what flaws it has. ;Irisis Irisis Stirm is another artisan and Tiaan's rival for promotion in the manufactory. She also comes from a well-respected family and uses this against Tiaan. The overseer of the manufactory is her second cousin although he does not favour her as much as she would like. She feels pressure from her family to become crafter, the chief artisan, as so many people in her family have held the position. ;Cryl- Nish Hlar Cryl-Nish Hlar is an artificer of average skill and an inexperienced spy for his father, Jal-Nish Hlar. He is usually known as Nish though he doesn't like the nickname much. He comes from a well-respected family and was a scribe to a merchant but his father had him moved to the manufactory. He hates the work but works hard, despite his lack of any real ability. ;Xervish Flydd Scrutator for the region of Einunar. One of few uncorrupt Scrutators. A member of the Council of Scrutators. When he is cast out he vows to bring down the corrupt Council and give Santhenar a chance of winning the war against the lyrinx. ;Vithis The leader of Clan Inthis and of all the Aachim of Aachan. He is the foster-father of Minis and is constantly forcing his will on his foster-son. He is arrogant in his superiority. ;Minis Foster-son of Vithis. He is timid and weak-willed and completely in Vithis's thrall. He contacts Tiaan from Aachan and pleads with her to save the Aachim. ;Gilhaelith A brilliant, yet eccentric, geomancer who has a need to control everything and everyone in his life. When he loses control he has panic attacks. He has out lived the normal life expectancy of a normal human, possibly by using his skills as a geomancer to prelong his life. He resides in Nyriandiol and takes Tiaan as his apprentice, shortly before being captured by the lyrinx. Once captured Gilhaelith is almost willing in his aid of them, Gilhaelith soon regrets this as it becomes clear that Matriarch Gyrull has no intention of letting him go. Though \\"almost willing\\" he stills keeps in mind his goal in life, to fully understand and control the forces of the world, by using his geomancers globe (a very detailed scaled model of Santhenar) to accomplish his life's aim. ;Ullii A hypersensitive young woman. She has a strange talent that allows her to see the Secret Art in all its forms. This talent identifies her as a Seeker. She develops feelings for Nish and becomes pregnant with his child, after they make love in the air-floater, while stranded near Tirthrax. Nish has feelings for Ullii, but not to the extent she does for him. ;Liett A deformed lyrinx, lacking armour or chameleon skin. The daughter of Matriarch Gyrull, she is a brilliant flesh-former and one of the greatest fliers among the lyrinx. She is passionate and opinionated, which sometimes gets in the way of her blossoming relationship with Ryll. Liett is strong in the Secret Art and her and Ryll often work together on such matters. ;Ryll Ryll is a deformed Lyrinx male who has only stubby useless wings and is a very talented flesh former. During the course of the series, he creates many of the Lyrinx's most dangerous flesh formed creations. By the end of Chimaera, he is appointed as the first Patriarch of the Lyrinx for three thousand years. Tiaan and Ryll have saved each other's lives several times and despite the war between their species, they come to regard each other as friends. He has romantic feelings towards Liett though he is often confused about her feelings towards him. ;Jal-Nish Perquisitor for the region of Einunar. He is the Father of Cryl-Nish Hlar. =Returning characters= Although The Well of Echoes does occur 207 years after the events of The View from the Mirror, two longer lived characters from that time do re-appear and have major roles in The Well of Echoes. These characters are: ;Malien A great and powerful mancer and Matah of all the Aachim of Santhenar. She befriends Tiaan in Tirthrax and helps her discover how to make constructs fly. She later helps Tiaan escape Vithis and his Clan Vengeance and decides to accompany her on her journeys. Malien becomes an important ally of Flydd's cause to bring down the Council of Scrutators. ;Yggur A great and powerful mancer who is over 1200 years old. He joins Flydd's cause but he and the Scrutator will forever be rivals. He helps coordinate the attack on Nennifer and it is he and Malien who cause the amplimet to wreak havoc on the fortress. He petitions against the annihilation of the lyrinx. Secondary characters Characters of great prominence but not to the extent of the above include: *Fyn-Mah *Haani *Chief Scrutator Ghorr *Scrutator Fusshte *Matriarch Gyrull *Scrutator Klarm *Flangers *Eiryn Muss =Seekers= A seeker is a person with the fictional ability to see the Secret Art in all its forms, within a mental lattice. Known seekers include: *Ullii is perhaps the most powerful Seeker of all, as she is able to make use of her lattice not just observe it. Her hypersensitivity also increases her power. *Myllii has a talent much like Ullii's though due to not being hypersensitive his is less powerful. *Young scavenger girl, able to sense where Irisis was with her talent. This was a native and less developed talent. Setting The Well of Echoes is set 207 years after The View from the Mirror. The events from that time directly affect the Three Worlds now. It is set on Santhenar, which is ravaged by war between the old humans and the lyrinx. The lyrinx escaped from the void when the Forbidding was broken. The war began 50 years after their arrival on Santhenar. The terrible Council of Scrutators has control of the world and hides the fact that it is the war itself that gives them power and so refuses to allow it to end. Though the people believe the Council (mancers all) to be the ones to control the world it is in fact the Numinator who pulls their strings, though he or she takes no active part in day-to-day life. Tiaan, an artisan from Tiksi, has a strange crystal dream and soon discovers that it is no dream at all. It is the Aachim of Aachan crying out for aid, their world is being destroyed by worldwide volcanic activity. Tiaan sets off to Tirthrax too ask for the Aachim of Santhenar's aid, but is captured by Ryll the lyrinx and is forced to help in the lyrinx's frightful flesh-forming. The Well of Echoes The Well of Echoes itself is a portal of pure energy, sacred to the Aachim, which they send their dead to and sometimes use as a means of execution. An Aachim who believes their life has extended beyond its natural course will also give themselves to the Well. One Well of Echoes resides at Tirthrax, held in place by powerful magic. When Tiaan arrives at Tirthrax, the amplimet begins to communicate with the extremely powerful Nodes there, and draws power from it. It then uses this power to begin to thaw the Well and it takes all the effort of Malien to hold the Well in place. When Tiaan leaves Malien has a bitter struggle with the Well, but ultimately is able to renew the Great Spell that holds it in place, with her great Arts. Only the Aachim of Clan Inthis can summon a Well of Echoes as they are the clan which discovered it and some claim, originated from it. While kept asleep, a Well is controllable by all the clans. It is possible that it acts as a node in this form. However, once awakened, it can only be controlled by Clan Inthis. An awakened Well appears as a vast circular hole in the ground with golden points of light streaming downwards in the walls. It does not exist in the normal three dimensions. When an awakened Well is summoned in Chimaera, it is seen to move underneath buildings, taking the dead from inside but leaving the buildings intact. Tears of the Node Tears of the Node are extremely powerful sorcerers' artefacts. The Tears are made of the purest substance on Santhenar, Nihilium. Even a tiny piece of Nihilium is craved by mancers beyond all things, as it can turn a minor-mancer into a mancer whose power surpasses all others. The Tears are exceptionally dangerous as they are each the size of a grapefruit and give the user the power of an entire Node. The Tears were formed when the node at Snizort exploded, because power was fed back into it, via the node- drainer. Jal-Nish secretly obtained the two tears and eventually used them to take control of the entirety of Santhenar. Jal-Nish refers to the two tears as Gatherer and Reaper.

Windle won the 1500 m freestyle and took bronze in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and silver and bronze in the 4 × 200 m and 4 × 100 m freestyle relays respectively at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Known for his versatility, he is the only male swimmer to represent Australia at the Olympics in all freestyle distances from 100 m to 1500 m. During his career, Windle set six world records and won six Commonwealth Games gold medals. He won 19 Australian championships in all distances from 220 yd to 1650 yd. Growing up in eastern Sydney, Windle was trained by Frank Guthrie from the age of 12. Windle's first major swimming competition was the 1960 Australian Championships. Aged 15, his second-place finish in the 1650 yd freestyle earned him a place on the team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. However, the Australian coaches only took him along to gain experience and he did not compete. He won his first national title in 1961—the 1650 yd freestyle—and claimed the 220–440–1650 yd treble in 1962. Windle made his international debut at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, winning gold in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle and silver and bronze in the 1650 and 440 yd freestyle respectively. In 1963, he won four individual national titles, adding the 880 yd event to the successful defence of his three titles. He won three individual titles in 1964 and proceeded to the Tokyo Olympics where he was eliminated in the heats of the 400 m freestyle after attempting to save energy for the final. In response, Windle took an aggressive approach in the 1500 m and set Olympic records in the heats and final to win gold. He added a bronze in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. After the Olympics, Windle enrolled at Indiana University, where he trained under Doc Counsilman. While in the United States, Windle converted to sprint swimming. He competed in the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, winning the 440 yd freestyle, 4 × 110 yd and 4 × 220 yd freestyle relays, all in world-record times. He competed in his second Olympics in Mexico City in 1968, racing the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the corresponding relays, having completed his transition to sprinting. He won a bronze and silver in the respective relays and retired after the games. In retirement, he worked for Allis-Chalmers in the United States, before being transferred to their Australian division.  Early years  Born in Sydney on 7 November 1944, Windle grew up in the eastern Sydney suburb of Waverley. Windle and his sister Norma learnt to swim at nearby Bronte Beach. His family later relocated to Bexley North, and he swam for his school team at Marist College Kogarah. Windle was coached by Frank Guthrie at the Enfield pool from the age of 12. After a fortnight of training, he entered the district age group championships and won a place in the top three. From then on, he began training three or four times a week, and his father drove him to Enfield for morning training. By the age of 15, he was training every day. A turning point for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650 yd freestyle behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He dropped out of high school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely wanted him to learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming.Andrews, pp. 465–466. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.Gordon, p. 257. Talbot nicknamed Windle \\"the greyhound\\" because of his thin and angular build. As a result of Windle's small build, he took between 45 and 47 strokes to complete a lap, but fellow distance swimmer Murray Rose needed only 35 to 37 strokes. Talbot said that Windle was the most thinly built elite swimmer that he had trained, and had great trouble in trying to increase Windle's frame. Talbot motivated Windle and instilled him with a greater level of self belief. For his part, Windle responded by increasing his workload, and was regarded as Talbot's most diligent student. Windle trained with a determination that often saw him swim through others who were in his training lane. These collisions led to complaints by recreational swimmers that Windle was too aggressive. He often did twice as much pre-season training as the other swimmers in Talbot's squad. According to Talbot, Windle's weakness was that he was only capable of swimming in two ways, flat out or very slowly. Windle had trouble in pacing himself to conserve energy for later events.Talbot, p. 61. Talbot lamented to \\"never [being] astute enough to realise that he [Windle] didn't have the subtleties of pace that would have added to his armament as a swimmer\\".Talbot, pp. 250–251.  First national title and international medals  At the 1961 Australian Championships, Windle won the 1500 m in a time of 17 min 37.7 s to claim his first Australian title at the age of 16. However, his victory was overshadowed when his bathers partly fell off during the race. In the following year, Windle showed his versatility by winning the 220 yd, 440 yd and 1650 yd freestyle events, in times of 2 min 2.9 s, 4 min 25.0 s and 17 min 53.3 s respectively. He also anchored the New South Wales team to victory in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle relay.Howell, p. 176. Selected for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, he marked his international debut with silver and bronze in the 1650 yd and 440 yd freestyle respectively. Murray Rose, who had returned from competition in the United States college system, won both events. Rose won the 1650 yd event, finishing in 17 min 18.1 s, with Windle 26.4 s in arrears. In the 440 yd event, Rose finished in a time of 4 min 20.0 s,Howell, p. 114. 3.1 s ahead of the third-placed Windle. Windle also won gold in the 4 × 220 yd freestyle relay, along with Rose, Allan Wood and Anthony Strahan, setting a world record in the process.Howell, p. 174. With Rose absent in the United States, Windle won the 220 yd, 440 yd, 880 yd and 1650 yd freestyle at the 1963 Australian Championships, in times of 2 min 2.8 s, 4 min 23.0 s, 9 min 10.5 s and 17 min 59.6 s respectively. His quest to sweep all of the freestyle events failed when David Dickson defeated him in a touch finish in the 110 yd race. The pair were neck and neck but Dickson judged the finishing touch on the wall better. Windle collected two more wins as part of the New South Wales team in the 4 × 220 yd and the 4 × 110 yd freestyle relays, anchoring both quartets. Windle set world records in the 200 m and 220 yd freestyle in 1963, posting times of 2 min 0.3 s and 2 min 1.1 s respectively. He won three individual titles at the 1964 Australian Championships, the 200 m, 400 m and 1500 m freestyle in times of 2 min 0.0 s, 4 min 17.6 s and 17 min 9.4 s respectively. As it was an Olympic year, the competition was held over metric distances, in conformance with Olympic standards. Windle was a member of all three New South Wales relay teams as they swept the relay events, winning the 400 m and 800 m freestyle and 400 m medley relays.Howell, p. 175.  Olympic gold  Windle's performances qualified him for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where he was slated to swim four events: the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle and the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. Windle's first event was the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, where he combined with Dickson, Peter Doak, and John Ryan to win Australia's heat in a time of 3 min 40.6 s, which lagged behind the United States' winning heat time by 1.8 s. Windle anchored the team as Australia came from second at the halfway point to win their heat. The Australians were the second fastest qualifier for the finals. However, the United States improved their time by a further 5.6 s in the final, but Australia could only improve their time to 3 min 39.1 s, leaving them third behind the Americans and Germans. Australia were in second place for the first two legs, until Germany moved into the silver medal position at the last change by 0.1 s. A distance swimmer, Windle could not keep up with his German anchorman counterpart, and Australia fell 1.9 s behind the silver medalists by the end of the race. In the 400 m freestyle heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in an attempt to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard in the first half of the race before slowing down.Talbot, p. 62. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4 min 21.6 s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5 s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.Talbot, pp. 61–62. In the 1500 m, Talbot decided that Windle would attack from the outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of dropping his elbow to a lower position when he was tired. Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats with a time of 17 min 15.9 s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17 min 1.7 s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3 s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own race. As a result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.Atkinson, p. 152. Windle later combined with Wood, Ryan and Dickson in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay final. Having rested their two individual medalists—Wood and Windle—in the heats, Australia struggled to fourth place and were the slowest qualifier for the final. In the decider, Australia were fourth when Windle dived in for the anchor leg, 3.7 s behind the third-placed Japan. Windle posted a time of 1 min 58.7 s, the sixth fastest split in the race and the fastest Australian leg by 3.0 s. Although he made up 1.8 s on the Japanese anchor swimmer, it was not enough and Australia finished fourth, 1.9 s out of the medals.  US college career  After the Olympics, Windle enrolled at Indiana University—whose Indiana Hoosiers swimming team was coached by Doc Counsilman—on an athletic scholarship. He did so after getting advice from Australian teammate, Olympic gold medallist and Indiana student Kevin Berry. He studied business while competing for the university, where he switched his focus to shorter sprint distances. Windle did not enjoy as much success at short-course swimming in the United States as he did in long-course swimming. He cited the lack of enjoyment for switching to shorter distances, quipping \\"Why swim 30 laps for a gold, when you can get one for swimming two laps?\\" However, Windle enjoyed his time in the United States, approving of the additional emphasis on relays and team spirit and the social life that it entailed. Windle also enjoyed learning from Counsilman, who was regarded as an expert in mechanics, resulting in an improvement in his swimming technique. Windle's performances in the United States for Indiana earned him selection for the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. He won the 440 yd freestyle in a world record time of 4 min 15.0 s, but with his focus now on the shorter distances, only managed fourth in the 1650 yd freestyle with a time of 17 min 49.2 s, 4% slower than his personal best for the distance. He won golds in the 4 × 110 yd freestyle relay with Ryan, Dickson and Michael Wenden and the 4 × 220 yd freestyle with Wenden, Dickson and Peter Reynolds. The times of 3 min 35.6 s and 7 min 59.5 s, respectively, were world records.  International farewell  In 1967, Windle retired, but made a comeback to compete in the shorter distances after being persuaded by Talbot. In 1968, Windle anchored Indiana's 880 yd freestyle relay to victory at the National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, sealing what would be the first of six consecutive men's team titles for the university. He then competed in the Australian Championships for the first time in four years. Although he did not win any individual events, he was part of New South Wales' winning quartets in the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. Windle was appointed the captain of the men's Olympic swimming team, gaining selection for the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events and the respective freestyle relays. He was not selected for the 1500 m freestyle, ending the defence of his Olympic title before the team had reached Mexico City. In the 100 m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat in a time of 54.8 s, making him the sixth fastest qualifier for the semifinals. He improved his time to 54.6 s in the semifinals, but this placed him only 11th and he missed the final by 0.5 s. In the 200 m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat behind Wenden and scraped into the final by 0.3 s as the seventh fastest qualifier. He improved his time by 0.1 s in the final to finish sixth in 2 min 0.9 s. Wenden won both events. After the 200 m final, Wenden lost consciousness due to exhaustion and sank underwater. Wenden was pulled from the water and saved after Windle noticed the incident. In the 4 × 100 m freestyle, Windle combined with Wenden, Robert Cusack and Greg Rogers to win bronze behind the United States and the Soviet Union. Australia used the same team and swimming order in both the heats and finals, with Windle doing the third leg. Australia came second in their heat behind the United States and qualified third overall, and the Soviet Union were the second fastest. It was a similar story in the final; Australia were third at every change. Despite Wenden anchoring the Australians with the fastest split among all 32 swimmers in the race, the Australians missed the silver medal by just 0.5 s. In the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, Windle won a silver along with Wenden, Rogers and Graham White. The quartet won their heat and qualified fastest, while the Americans qualified second with their second-choice team. However, using their full-strength team in the final, the Americans won by 1.4 s. Australia were 2.5 s behind at the halfway point of the race, but the Americans were able to hold on, despite the gains made by Windle and Wenden in the last two legs.Gordon, p. 277. Windle retired after the Games, noting that \\"I have swum to that point when I could hardly lift myself out of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. I would always give 110%. There is no substitute for hard and honest work\\". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations.Howell, p. 177. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.

Mossimo specializes in youth and teenage clothing such as shirts, jeans, jackets, socks, underwear, and accessories. History =Founding (1986) and expansion= Mossimo was founded in 1986 by Mossimo Giannulli on Balboa Island in Newport Beach, California. Mossimo dropped out of the University of Southern California in 1987 to create his self-named streetwear line, with a $100,000 loan from his father. During his first year in business he grossed $1 million. The following year he made $4 million. In 1991, Mossimo expanded the line to include sweatshirts, knits, and sweaters. By 1995, the collection included women's clothing and men's tailored suits. After eight years in business, Mossimo, Inc. had grown into a multimillion-dollar lifestyle sportswear and accessories company. =IPO (1996) and relationship with Target (2000–2017)= In 1996, Mossimo went public in an initial public offering. After shares tumbled from $50.00 to $4.75 when Giannulli tried and failed to transition the brand from streetwear/beachwear to high fashion, he took the brand downscale. On March 28, 2000, Mossimo, Inc announced a major, multi- product licensing agreement with Target stores, for $27.8 million.Earnest, Leslie (29 March 2000). With Losses Mounting, Mossimo Turns to Target, The Los Angeles Times. In 2017, Target underwent a makeover, introducing new smaller lines and eliminating bigger billion-dollar lines, including Mossimo. Target distanced itself from Mossimo amid Mossimo Giannulli's alleged involvement in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, saying that Target had not been involved with Giannulli in over a decade. Mossimo and his wife, actress Lori Loughlin, have been accused of bribing University of Southern California officials with up to $500,000, to secure enrolment of their two daughters. =Acquisition by Iconix (2006)= In 2006, Mossimo was acquired by Iconix Brand Group.

Its sudden popularity has given rise to parties with the same name and similar goals in Europe and worldwide, forming the International Pirate Party movement. The Pirate Party was initially formed to reform laws regarding copyright and patents. The party agenda includes support for strengthening the individual's right to privacy, both on the Internet and in everyday life, and the transparency of state administration. The Pirate Party has intentionally chosen to be bloc independent of the traditional left-right scale\\"Vågmästarställning\\" from piratpartiet.se, accessed on August 28, 2006 to pursue their political agenda with all mainstream parties. The party originally stayed neutral on other matters, but started broadening into other political areas in 2012. The Pirate Party participated in the 2006 Riksdag elections and gained 0.63% of the votes, making them the third largest party outside parliament. In terms of membership, it passed the Green Party in December 2008, the Left Party in February 2009, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats in April 2009,Result of Verdict, for the Pirate Party . Blog Pirate. April 17, 2009. and the Centre Party in May 2009, making it, for the time being, the third largest political party in Sweden by membership.Comparisons of membership numbers may not be considered fair by some, as the Pirate Party does not charge a membership fee, which is commonplace for other parties The Pirate Party's associated youth organisation, Young Pirate (), was, for a part of 2009 and 2010, the largest political youth organisation in Sweden by membership count. The Pirate Party came 5th in the 2009 European Parliament elections with 7.13% of the vote and 1 MEP (increasing to 2 after ratification of the Lisbon Treaty). Christian Engström became the first MEP for the party, and Amelia Andersdotter took the second seat on 1 December 2009. Rick Falkvinge, founder of the party, stepped down on 1 January 2011 after five years as party leader, making vice leader Anna Troberg the party leader. On 1 December 2014, Anna Troberg announced that she would not be available for re-election in 2015 after her term ended on 31 December 2014.  Declaration of principles  The party advocates a severe reduction of economic sole right of copyrighted works, which today exist for 70 years after the creator's death. They also advocate releasing all non- commercial sharing of copyrighted material, which means that all films, phonograms and programs can be shared freely as long as the operation isn't run commercially. The party also has personal privacy as a core value, and is critical towards laws such as ACTA, IPRED, the Telecoms Package, and the change in legislation regulating the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA). The party advocates strengthened individual privacy, are against the Data Retention Directive, wants to elevate secrecy of correspondence to general secrecy of communication, and create a constitutional right to privacy. The party also seeks to modify the laws of intellectual property (copyright and patent), but doesn't want to change the laws of trademarks or industrial design rights. The party views itself as a defender of the individual's civil rights especially with regards to surveillance, government accountability and political and business corruption. Before the Swedish general election of 2010 the party stayed neutral in all other political matters, and could be considered a single-issue party. After 2010 the party started opening up for a broader political agenda. A new declaration of principles was formed in 2011, and at the spring member meeting of 2012 several new political standpoints were decided on areas such as school, research and health care.  History  = Founding = The website for the Pirate Party was launched on 1 January 2006 (at 20.30 CEST), marking the foundation of the Party. Six phases were presented on the website, with phase one being the collection of at least 2,000 signatures (500 more than required) to be handed over to the Swedish Election Authority before the 4th of February (the deadline for registering being February 28), so that the Party would be allowed to participate in the upcoming 17 September general election. In less than 24 hours after the opening of the website, the Party had collected over 2,000 signatures (2,268 at 16.05 CEST). By the morning of the 3rd of January, the Party closed the signature collection. In about 36 hours, they had gathered 4,725 signatures. As signatories are required by Swedish election law to identify themselves when giving support for a new party, international media reported this as a significant feat, given the nature of the Party. However, signatures presented to the election authorities are required to be handwritten. The goal of at least 1,500 handwritten signatures was reached February 10 and the final confirmation from the authorities was presented three days later. The Party claimed to have recruited 900 members within the first month, each member paying a membership fee of 5 Swedish kronor (approx. US$0.69, c.2006), payable by SMS (The Party has since changed to free member registration). Phases two to five included registering with the Election Authority, getting candidates for the Riksdag, raising money for printing ballots, and preparing an organization for the election, including local organizations in all municipalities of Sweden with a population in excess of 50,000, which in 2005 meant 43 municipalities. During this phase fundraising was also started, with an initial goal of raising 1 million SEK ($126,409). The sixth and final phase was the election itself. The Party, which claims that there are between 800,000 and 1.1 million active file sharers in Sweden, hoped that at least 225,000 (4% of all the voters in Sweden) of those would vote for the party, granting them membership in Parliament. = Initial media attention = Rick Falkvinge, founder and party leader from 2006 to 2011 Media quickly picked up on the movement. On Monday 2 January 2006, a large Swedish financial newspaper, Dagens Industri, produced a story on what was happening. By 3 pm, the media seemed irritated that no owner of the website was listed or easy to track down; some reports listed the website as not serious and a PR stunt. However, the largest Swedish tabloid, Aftonbladet, managed to track down the Party leader Rickard Falkvinge at work. Falkvinge, however, was unable to explain the Party's positions while at work, bringing this information gathering effort to an abrupt end. On 3 January 2006, all the major Swedish news outlets had produced stories on the Party. Aftonbladet posted an online poll indicating that its readers gave the Party a 61% approval rating,\\"Would you consider voting for the Pirate Party?\\" , poll by Aftonbladet, at 61% yes in early January of 2006 with 50,000 responding; at 57% on 30 July 2006 with 99,000 responding and IDG produced a longer front page interview with Falkvinge in the afternoon. IDG also posted an online poll similar to the first, with similar results.\\"Would you consider voting for a pirate party?\\", poll by IDG, active January 3–9, 2006. Retrieved July 30, 2006. The Party website was also slashdotted.\\"Swedish Filesharers Start 'The Piracy Party'\\" from slashdot.org, accessed on July 14, 2009 The Pirate Party's web server received one million hits on its first day of operation, two million the next. On 4 January, international media and radio stations picked up the story. A major Swedish radio station broadcast an interview with Falkvinge about the unexpected amount of attention the initiative received. More attention followed on Thursday, including coverage by the BBC World Service, the first global radio station to produce a story on the Pirate Party initiative. At the end of the first week, the Pirate Party platform had been covered by over 500 English-language and over 600 Swedish-language media outlets. = The Pirate Bay trial = A Pirate Party banner at the demonstration held in Stockholm 3 June 2006. Crowd at the 3 June demonstration. On 31 May 2006, Swedish police raided a facility hosting The Pirate Bay (and Piratbyrån, along with over 200 other independent site owners, hosted at the same facility), leading to a breakthrough for the Pirate Party in the public eye. Before the raid, the Party was steadily growing with some ten new members every day, but the raid caused a surge of 500 new members by the end of the day, with a membership count of 2,680. The next day another 930 people had registered membership, giving a total of 3,611 members, more than doubling their original number. During parts of 2006 Mikael Viborg, who is also known as the legal advisor of the popular BitTorrent tracker, The Pirate Bay was a board member of the Pirate Party. On 3 June 2006, the Party performed a \\"pirate demonstration\\"\\"Pictures from the piracy demonstration\\" , by Ulf Sjöström, Pirate Watch, June 3, 2006, accessed on June 5, 2006 in Stockholm and Gothenburg. The demonstration was in collaboration with the youth sections of some other political parties (the Young Liberals, Young Greens and Young Left). Within a few days the file sharing issue had become the focus of national debate, followed by national as well as international media. Along with criticizing the approach to restricting Pirate Bay's file sharing by the Minister for Justice Thomas Bodström, the right to free information and rule of law became the Party's main standpoints. The Pirate Party had over 50,189 members – more members than 5 of the 7 parties in the Swedish Parliament – and was the third largest political party in Sweden by member count. Pirate Party's youth organisation, Young Pirate, had more than 21,800 members, making it the largest political youth organisation in Sweden.\\"Medlemsantal\\" from piratpartiet.se, accessed on May 28, 2009 Since 17 April 2009, the party had more than tripled in size. Large increases in membership were associated with the controversial legislative change regulating signals intelligence, the IPRED law regarding copyright holder access to ISP subscriber information and the trial against The Pirate Bay. On 17 April 2009 the court reached a guilty verdict in the Pirate Bay trial and on the same day the Pirate Party gained 3,000 new members within 7 hours, making it larger in terms of members than 3 of the 7 parties in the Parliament of Sweden. A total of over 9,000 new members joined the party on that day and the day after. One week later it reached 40,000 members, compared to 15,000 members before the verdict. On 30 April 2009, a newspaper election poll reported the Pirate Party vote to be 5.1% for the upcoming European Parliament election. Another more recent poll conducted by polling organization Demoskop for newspaper Upsala Nya Tidning gave the party 7.9%.\\"M tappar opinionsstöd \\" from unt.se (Swedish), accessed on May 25, 2009 The party eventually received 7.1% of the vote in the 7th June election, and won a seat in the European Parliament. = 2010s decade = On 18 May 2010, The Pirate Bay started hosting its site through bandwidth delivered from the Pirate Party. On 17 August 2010, it was announced that the Pirate Party will be hosting and managing many of WikiLeaks' new servers. The party donates servers and bandwidth to WikiLeaks without charge. Technicians of the party will make sure that the servers are maintained and working. On 19 September 2010, the party won 0.7% of the votes in the 2010 general election, slightly increasing its performance in comparison to the 2006 general election. On 1 January 2011, the party celebrated its five-year anniversary with a Bambuser live broadcast with party leader Rick Falkvinge and vice party leader Anna Troberg. Live in the video, Falkvinge sent a tweet saying he stepped down as party leader, and he announced that his successor would be Troberg. Falkvinge now works as an evangelist, spreading the politics of the Pirate Party in and out of Europe. On December 2011, the party launched Free & Social, a social networking/microblogging service. In the 2014 general election and the 2014 European Parliament election the party won 0.4% respectively 2.2% of the votes and consequently lost their seats in the European Parliament. In the 2018 general election and the 2019 European Parliament election the party won 0.1% respectively 0.6% of the votes. After peaking at about 50,000 in late 2009 the membership numbers did steadily decline to about 2,500 party members in early 2020.  Political impact  = National = Less than a week before the 2006 elections, the Green Party shifted their stance on copyright reform.Släpp filerna fria! , by the Swedish Greens Additionally, both the Moderate Party and the Left Party changed their stances on internet downloads,Larger parties bend to support file-sharing under political pressure from P2P Consortium, accessed on June 9, 2006Nu vänder v och m i piratfrågan from Expressen, accessed on June 9, 2006 and both prime ministerial candidates stated publicly that it shouldn't be illegal for young people to share files.\\"Upphovsmän kan få jaga fildelare\\" , Dagens Nyheter, February 4, 2007 Several influential analysts have credited the Pirate Party and its rising popularity for this shift in the political climate; these include a panel of senior editors at International Data Group\\"Piratpartiet har lyckats\\", published by PC för Alla and political analysts at the largest morning newspaper, Dagens Nyheter.\\"Bara mp vill ändra lagen\\" , Dagens Nyheter, February 4, 2007 Additionally, the then Swedish Minister of Justice Thomas Bodström, announced on 9 June that he was willing to negotiate a possible revision of the law introduced in 2005 that made unauthorised downloading of copyrighted material illegal, introducing a new tax on broadband Internet access, but he later denied having changed his stance on the issue.Bodström: \\"Jag har inte ändrat ståndpunkt\\" from Aftonbladet, accessed on June 9, 2006 After the 2006 elections, the issue faded from the public debate. In January 2008, seven Swedish members of parliament from the conservative Moderate Party, senior member of the governing Alliance coalition, authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete decriminalisation of filesharing. The Swedish members of parliament wrote that \\"Decriminalising all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution. It's the only solution, unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the Internet.\\"Swedish prosecutors dump 4,000 legal docs on The Pirate Bay Ars Technica, accessed on August 5, 2008 = International = thumb240px Outside Sweden, pirate parties have been started in some 33 countries, inspired by the Swedish initiative. They cooperate through Pirate Parties International (PPI). The Pirate Party of Germany gained seats in the city council of Münster and Aachen in August 2009, and in the federal election a month later they received 2.0% of the party list votes, becoming the biggest party outside the Bundestag. In the election to the Abgeordnetenhaus in Berlin in September 2011, the Pirate Party received 9% of the votes and, for the first time in Germany, gained seats in a state parliament. = Free software = Richard Stallman has expressed concern that the Pirate Party's goal of reducing copyright term to 5 years could harm the free software movement. Many free software licenses, mainly the GPL, are based on long-term copyrights. Stallman argues that if copyright terms are reduced to 5 years, proprietary software vendors would be able to take free software and use it in proprietary software once the copyright expires. But proprietary software is restricted by EULAs in addition to copyright, and the source code is not available, rendering the proprietary software unusable for free software developers even after its copyright expires. Stallman suggests that under this new copyright law, proprietary software developers should put their code in escrow when the software's binaries are released and then release their software into the public domain immediately after their copyright expires.  Election results, voter base  = 2006 Swedish general election = The Pirate Party attracted 34,918 votes in the Swedish general election of 2006, their first participation at an election for parliament since the founding of the party less than 9 months prior. With 0.63% of the overall votes, it became the 10th biggest party of more than 40 participating. However, a voting result of less than 4% of the total votes does not qualify the party for seats in the Swedish Parliament. Getting more than 1% of the vote would have granted the party financial assistance from the state for printing ballots which is costly in Sweden, while at least 2.5% would grant them state funds for campaigning in the next election. Despite the setbacks, Falkvinge began planning for the Swedish general election in 2010.\\"Voters Keelhaul Pirate Party\\" from wired.com, accessed on September 20, 2006 = 2009 European Parliament election = In the first pre-election poll\\"Unga väljare kan ge Piratpartiet EU-mandat\\" from dn.se, accessed on May 6, 2009 before the 2009 European Parliament election, the Pirate Party registered at 5.1%, which would be enough to get a seat in the parliament.

The Pirate Party joined The Greens-European Free Alliance group. The Pirate Party of Germany also participated in the European Parliament elections, which was their first participation in a nationwide election, and achieved 0.9% in Germany, getting 230,000 votes. They missed the 5% level by a wide margin but qualified for public funding. = 2010 election = In the 2010 general election, the Pirate Party increased their percentage of the vote by 0.02%, bringing it to a total of 0.65%, remaining under the required amount to gain a seat, but becoming the biggest party outside of Parliament. = Parliament (Riksdag) = { class=wikitable - !

Of these three, Piratbyrån and The Pirate Bay share a common history but are now separate, whereas the Pirate Party developed on a completely separate and parallel track, founded by Falkvinge, and was initially unrelated to the other two. This was until 18 May 2010, when the Pirate Party became The Pirate Bay's ISP in response to an injunction that temporarily shut down access to The Pirate Bay, with the Pirate Party stating that \\"It is time to take the bull by the horns and stand up for what we believe is a legitimate activity.\\"  See also  * Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) * Elections in Sweden * EU Copyright Directive and DADVSI * 2009 European Parliament election in Sweden * National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) * Patent pirate * Piratbyrån * Pirate Parties International * Politics of Sweden * The Pirate Bay  References   External links  = Official sites, documents = * Pirate Party official site * Declaration of Principles * 2006 Election Manifesto 2006 election manifesto = Interviews = * Interview with founder in The Local by Agence France-Presse * YouTube Interview with Founder Rick Falkvinge = Speeches = * Rickard Falkvinge speaks at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2007 (27 July 2007) * Rickard Falkvinge speaks at Google (31 July 2007) * Rickard Falkvinge speaks at Stanford Law School (31 July 2007) * Rickard Falkvinge speaks at the party congress 2007 of the German Pirate Party Part 2 Part 3 * Rickard Falkvinge speaks at the PPI Conference Friedrichshafen, Germany (13 Mar 2011) Sweden Category:Political parties established in 2006 Category:File sharing Category:Intellectual property activism Category:Swedish intellectual property law Category:2006 establishments in Sweden Category:Minor political parties in Sweden gl:Partido Pirata ","title":"Pirate Party (Sweden)"},{"id":"5058295","text":"John Keith Dunstan OAM (3 February 1925 – 11 September 2013), known as Keith Dunstan, was an Australian journalist and author.

He was Foreign Correspondent for the H&WT; with posts in New York (1949–52) and London (1952–54). This period was followed by a position with The Courier-Mail for which he wrote a column \\"Day by Day\\". He returned to Melbourne and from 1958 to 1978 contributed a daily column, \\"A Place in the Sun\\" for The Sun News- Pictorial, the city’s largest circulating daily newspaper. During these years his popularity grew and he became a Melbourne institution. From 1962 he wrote regularly for the Sydney-based weekly magazine The Bulletin under the pseudonym of Batman (after the city’s controversial founder, John Batman) and for the travel magazine Walkabout. In 1976 and 1977 he was president of the Melbourne Press Club, succeeding Rohan Rivett.\\"Melbourne Press Club events\\" , Melbourne Press Club website. Retrieved 12 October 2013. He was the United States West Coast Correspondent (1979–82) for the Herald and Weekly Times. Later, he was a regular columnist and occasional contributor to The Age newspaper. Author He published a quartet of books on Australian character: Wowsers (1968), Knockers (1972), Sports (1973) and Ratbags (1979) and many works of history on popular subjects ranging from wine to sport to retailing, and including an unfashionably critical study of the Australian outlaw Ned Kelly, Saint Ned (1980). His pioneering works of Australian sports history included The Paddock That Grew (1962) on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which has now seen several editions and updates. He also wrote an autobiography, No Brains at All (1990). Other publications included The Melbourne I Remember (2004) and Moonee Ponds to Broadway (2006), a study of his friend and fellow Melburnian, the satirist Barry Humphries. Other activities In 1967 he became founding secretary of the Anti-Football League, a tongue-in-cheek organisation that pokes fun at the Australian rules football obsession. An enthusiastic commuter and recreational cyclist, he was the first president of the Bicycle Institute of Victoria (now known as Bicycle Network) from its founding in 1974 to 1978. He was a bicycle touring enthusiast who with his wife Marie cycled across the USA in the 1970s and through China in the 1980s. Whilst living on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula he was an enthusiastic grower and maker of pinot noir wine.

The first Western Australian to win Olympic gold, O'Halloran learnt to swim in his hometown of Katanning. He moved to Perth to attend secondary schooling at Guildford Grammar School, where he became more committed to swimming. Competitive swimming was not well developed in Western Australia; races were held in muddy river pools. So in late 1955, O'Halloran moved to the east coast to support his attempt to qualify for the Olympics. His new coach, Frank Guthrie, overhauled his training regimen, and within a year O'Halloran had reduced his times by approximately ten percent. He gained Olympic selection in the relay and the 400-metre freestyle. O'Halloran led off the Australian quartet on the way to a new world record, before placing sixth in the 400-metre. Thereafter, O'Halloran's career was beset by ear problems, and he retired in 1958 after failing to qualify for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. In 1976, O'Halloran died after tripping and accidentally shooting himself. Early years Born in Katanning, O'Halloran grew up in Kojonup, to the west of his Katanning. He had two brothers and a sister, and the family lived on a sheep farm established by his grandfather in 1900. But after his father enlisted during the Second World War, his mother could no longer run the farm and raise the children by herself, so the family returned to Katanning and stayed there for seven years.Howell, p. 139. It was one of the few country towns in Western Australia that had a public swimming pool. Along with his siblings, O'Halloran learned to swim there, often defeating local boys who were four years his senior. At the age of eight, he was taught to swim competitively by his teacher at Katanning State Primary School. She had been an age group champion in her youth. The boom in wool prices at the time of the Korean War inflated his family's income, allowing them to send O'Halloran to Guildford Grammar School in Perth, the state's capital city. At the age of 14, he won five events in the school championships and led the school to its first state championship in 29 years. He also competed for his school in Australian rules football and rowing. O'Halloran attracted the attention of the leading Western Australian coach, Don Gravenall, but his schoolwork limited him to a few weeks of intense training over Christmas. In 1952, at the age of 15, O'Halloran began to make his mark at the state level. He played a major role in Guildford's win at the interschool championships, placing second in the individual points tally. He won the 100 m freestyle, 50 m breaststroke and 400 m freestyle. Competitive swimming was slow to develop in Western Australia; the Western Australian Championships second event was held in 1952. And O'Halloran's state debut came in that year. He won the junior 110 yd freestyle and butterfly and the 220 yd freestyle and was second in the open 110 yd freestyle. The competition took place in a muddy pool on the Swan River in the Perth suburb of Crawley. The arena was such that the bottom could not be seen and jellyfish lurked in the area, sometimes climbing onto the swimmers' bodies. When O'Halloran returned to his home, he often trained in a muddy waterhole.Howell, p. 140. Swimming career In 1953, O'Halloran placed second in the 110 yd and 440 yd freestyle events at the Western Australian Championships in the open division and won the 110 yd breaststroke and the 110- and 220 yd freestyle in the junior division. In the process, he cut six seconds from the state record in the 440 yd event. He was selected by the Western Australian team to compete in the Australian Championships, but his parents and headmaster decided that his schooling was more important, much to Gravenall's chagrin. In 1954, O'Halloran was the state champion in the 110 yd and 220 yd freestyle, and in 1955 he added the 440 yd individual medley title to the successful defence of his freestyle crowns. In his final year at Guildford, O'Halloran was the School Captain, led the swimming and shooting team, and was a member of the rowing eights in the Head of the River. O'Halloran made his national debut at the 1955 Australian Championships in Adelaide; he finished fifth in the 110 yd freestyle behind future Olympians Jon Henricks and John Devitt. Upon the recommendation of his parents, O'Halloran moved to Sydney in late 1955 to train with Frank Guthrie in an attempt to qualify for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. He boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses. But his initiation into Guthrie's training program was difficult. After seeing O'Halloran's freestyle technique for the first time, Guthrie asked him, \\"Can you swim any other stroke? If you are going to swim for me, you'll have to learn all over again.\\" O'Halloran refined his style and increased his workload to around 10 km a day, something that was normal for competitive swimmers in the eastern states, but uncommon in Western Australia. In one month, he cut 17 s off his personal best time in the 440 yd freestyle, reducing it to 4 min 55 s. At the 1956 New South Wales Championships, he finished third in the 220 yd freestyle behind Gary Chapman and John Devitt; his time of 2 min 12.6 s was 10 s faster than the times he had recorded in Western Australia. He came in fourth in both the 110 yd and 440 yd. In the 110 yd event, he breached the 60 s barrier for the first time. And his time in the 440 yd was more than 30 s faster than his best time in Western Australia. At the Australian Championships, he came third in the 440 yd freestyle in a time of 4 min 37.8 s behind Murray Rose and Murray Garretty. He did this despite suffering from ear trouble, making him the fifth-fastest swimmer in the world for the 1956 calendar year, which earned him an individual berth in the 400 m event at the Olympics.Howell, p. 141. O'Halloran came fourth in the 220 yd in a time of 2 min 9.2 s to earn a berth on the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay squad. With Rose, Henricks, and Chapman regarded as certain selections for the final quartet, O'Halloran was expected to battle for the fourth relay position. At the end of the trials, Guthrie claimed that O'Halloran was \\"the find of the recently held Australian Championships and the future swimmer for Australia. I am confident that we did not see Kevin's best times this season.\\" 1956 Melbourne Olympics Having arrived in Melbourne, O'Halloran was rested, along with Rose and Henricks, in the heats of the relay. Devitt, Chapman, Graham Hamilton and Garretty finished third in their heat behind Great Britain and the Soviet Union, and qualified fifth-fastest behind Japan and the United States.Howell, p. 138. Australia led from the start and reached the midpoint of the race with a lead of 4.5 s. Hamilton swam a very slow third leg of 2 min 15.4 s and conceded 8.8 s to the British. Australia's final quartet was much stronger, with Rose winning the 400 m freestyle, and Henricks and Devitt winning the gold and silver medals respectively in the 100 m freestyle. Devitt had forced his way into the team with his heat swim of 2 min 7.5 s, which was the second-fastest among all of the swimmers in the heats. With four of the five fastest individual swimmers in the calendar year for the event,Gordon, p. 211. Australia was heavily favoured to win the relay; Sports Illustrated predicted a world record and a victory margin of around 14 metres. O'Halloran's inclusion at the expense of Chapman was the subject of controversy, because Chapman had won bronze in the 100 m event and was the national 220 yd freestyle champion. O'Halloran's selection also broke up the team of Devitt, Rose, Chapman and Henricks, which had won the relay for New South Wales at the Australian Championships. O'Halloran led off and put Australia in the lead with an Olympic record time of 2 min 6.8 s, opening a gap of 0.7 s over the Soviet Union and 1.2 s over the United States. The fourth-placed Italians were already a full three seconds in arrears. Australia never relinquished the lead and steadily increased it, as Devitt, Rose, and Henricks set the three fastest splits in the race, faster than all the non-Australian swimmers. O'Halloran's split was the fifth-fastest in the race; the Soviet anchor swimmer was the only non- Australian to swim faster, and only by 0.1 s despite having the benefit of a flying start. This resulted in Australia winning gold in a world record time of 8 min 23.6 s, almost eight seconds ahead of the second-place Americans and 13 ahead of the Soviets.Gordon, p. 218. The win made O'Halloran the first Western Australian to win any Olympic medal. In his only individual event, O'Halloran qualified for the 400 m final, having won his heat in a time of 4 min 36.8 s, 0.5 s ahead of Japan's Koji Nonoshita. However, his heat was relatively slow, meaning that he was the sixth-fastest qualifier. Swimming from lane seven, O'Halloran cut almost 4 s off his personal best but lost the bronze medal to the United States' George Breen by 0.4 s, in a race won by Rose.Gordon, p. 489. O'Halloran reduced Breen's margin by 1.3 s in the last 100 m, but it was not enough; he finished with a time of 4 min 32.9 s. O'Halloran returned to Perth after the Olympics to be welcomed by a motorcade and a civic reception. He was named as one of the five Western Australian Sportspeople of the Year in recognition of his winning performance. Despite his achievements, the state government ignored calls for Western Australia to build an Olympic standard swimming pool until 1962, when they constructed one for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth. Later years In 1958, O'Halloran's parents travelled across the continent to watch him swim at the Australian Championships in Sydney, but a recurring ear infection hindered his performances. He missed selection for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff and retired after the long car journey back across the Nullarbor. Upon arriving in Kojonup, O'Halloran was reported to have said, \\"I've had enough\\". O'Halloran then worked full-time on the family property. In 1976, his body was discovered next to a rifle, near a fence on the property; he had tripped as he climbed through the fence, and he accidentally shot himself.Andrews, pp. 328–329.Gordon, p. 453. O'Halloran never married. The 50 m pool at Kojonup was named the Kevin O'Halloran Memorial Pool in his honour, and he was posthumously inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions.

Description  Created by Wipeout designer Nick Burcombe, the game puts the player in the shoes of 16 different characters, paired off in rivalries, whose stories unfold as tournaments are completed. The game has five different speed limits, which act as the difficulty levels for the game. Points earned after races allow players to upgrade their hovercraft's offensive and defensive capabilities. The game featured a soundtrack by Dutch musician Junkie XL. The biggest selling point of Quantum Redshift was the graphics detail it possessed. Water and glass would show real-time reflections, each of the game worlds were abundant with high-resolution textures, and the camera \\"lens\\" would be flecked with water droplets after being submerged. Quantum Redshift was rated as one of the most graphically advanced games for the Xbox.  Reception  While featuring 16 different characters, critics generally noted that there was not anything particularly \\"likable\\" about the characters. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40.Xbox - カンタム レッドシフト 超高速空間バトルレース. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.108. 30 June 2006. Despite the critical response to Quantum Redshift being positive, garnering 76% at GameRankings, the game sold poorly. As a result, the second game, which was to include multi-play over Xbox Live was cancelled by Microsoft, and Curly Monsters closed shop shortly thereafter. As Curly Monsters said a statement before they closed down \\"We were pursuing a number of avenues, and we'd developed some really cool new Xbox technology, but unfortunately we were not able to sign a deal prior to us running out of cash... we've not been able to pay our staff for the last month, and now it's time to (unfortunately) call it quits...

The Christofilos effect, a type of electromagnetic shielding, is named after him. Career Christofilos was born in Boston, Massachusetts and raised in Greece. He attended the National Technical University of Athens at age 18, and graduated with a degree in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering in 1938. He remained in Greece during World War II, working for an Athens elevator maintenance company during the Nazi occupation. He later founded his own elevator company. During all of this, he maintained an amateur interest in accelerator physics and high-energy particle physics, and studied German and American texts on the subjects extensively. In 1946 he independently developed ideas for a synchrotron and in 1949 he conceived the strong-focusing principle. Rather than publishing in a journal he submitted a patent application in the US, filed 1950-03-10. and Greece. His discovery went unnoticed for several years, and strong focusing was rediscovered by Ernest Courant et al. in 1952 (who acknowledged his priority one year later), and applied to accelerators at BNL, Cornell and CERN. Christofilos was offered a position at Brookhaven in 1953. In 1956 he joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to continue his work on the Astron, a proposed fusion reactor under the Sherwood Project. At LLNL, Christofilos worked on a number of military projects. He became a member of JASON and was the principal behind Operation Argus, a series of high-altitude nuclear detonations intended to create a radiation belt in the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere as a defence against Soviet ICBMs. In 1958 Christofilos proposed Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves as a way to communicate with submerged submarines, and subsequently invented the ground dipole, the only antenna that has proven practical for use at ELF frequencies. His ideas were implemented by the U.S. Navy in Project Seafarer, which constructed huge ELF transmitter facilities in Michigan and Wisconsin consisting of 56 miles (90 km) of electric transmission line. These were used from 1985 to 2004 for worldwide communication with U.S. nuclear submarines. In 1963 he was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal. Herbert York described Christofilos as follows:The Advanced Research Projects Agency, 1958-1974, Barber Associates, December 1975, page IV-23. :Nick was a remarkable idea man. The ideas were usually not goodBarber Associates, loc. cit. \\"One of Christofilos' 'not good' ideas was to build a large aircraft runway across the entire U.S., coast to cost, so that the Soviets could never catch most of the SAC aircraft on the ground at the same time.\\", but they were really remarkable in that they were the kind of ideas that nobody else had. Nick really was a genius in a very important sense  he often invented things that required two new ideas simultaneously, which is something that normally, hardly anyone ever does.

These wagers are most commonly made in the United States and Canada on the results of playoffs in the National Hockey League, National Football League and Major League Baseball as well as, on occasion, the Olympic Games. Although they are technically a form of gambling, friendly political wagers are generally tolerated by the sports leagues and regulatory authorities as harmless publicity stunts and gestures of regional pride. Differences from typical sports betting Friendly political wagers * The wagers are highly publicised, usually with official press releases. * The participants are generally high-ranking politicians; most commonly mayors, but also frequently including governors, and Senators and (much more rarely) even national leaders. For additional effect, the two wagering parties may be (but are not always) members of opposite political parties. * The bets are made directly with each other, with no bookmakers involved. * The participants must bet in favor of the team that they represent; for instance, the mayor of Green Bay would only make a friendly wager of this sort on the outcome of a Green Bay Packers game by betting in favor of the Packers. * Usually occur during high- profile playoff games. * Are for symbolic wagers, usually prestige or local food or drink. * They do not involve money. * In the rare event money is wagered, the bet is an even bet (no point spread or money line is used) and the wager is donated to a local charity in the winner's metropolitan area.http://wivb.com/2018/01/05/buffalo-jacksonville-zoos-make-friendly-wager- ahead-of-bills-vs-jaguars-playoff-game/ * They do not involve influencing the way the officials vote on legislation. * They do not involve wagering the office (a rival officeholder cannot demand his opponent's resignation). Examples The most common types of wager are those for symbolic value only, and those for a token food prize. For example in the 2009–10 NFL playoffs, two bets were made: *Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made a friendly wager on the outcome of the 2010 National Football Conference Championship Game between the New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings: \\"If the Saints win, Klobuchar will cook gumbo and deliver it to Landrieu's office while wearing a Drew Brees jersey for Louisiana constituents to enjoy. If the Vikings win, Landrieu will cook a Minnesota wild rice casserole and deliver it to Klobuchar's office while wearing a Brett Favre jersey for Minnesota constituents to enjoy.\\" The Saints won. *Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick bet over the outcome of the game between the Baltimore Ravens and the New England Patriots. O'Malley promised Maryland crab cakes to Patrick if the Ravens lost, while Patrick pledged lobsters if the Patriots lost. The Ravens prevailed, and O'Malley, in a YouTube video, said \\"Hey Deval, send down the lob-stah\\" in a mock Boston accent.\\" During the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, US President Barack Obama and Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper wagered a case of beer on the outcome of the gold medal game in the men's ice hockey tournament. President Obama sent Prime Minister Harper a case of Molson Canadian and a case of Yuengling lager (Obama's favorite beer, brewed in Pennsylvania) to settle the bet. A similar sort of betting occurs elsewhere, although the subject is as likely not to be sport. German Green politician and gastronome Joschka Fischer was noted for betting cases of wine and fine spirits on the outcomes of German elections with politicians of other parties. In October 2011, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key made two bets: the first on the NRL grand final between the Manly Sea Eagles and the New Zealand Warriors, wagering having to hold a press conference in front of the other country's flag; and the second on the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final between New Zealand and Australia, wagering having to eat an apple from the other country and speak profusely on how good it was (reflecting Australia recently lifting a ban on the import of New Zealand apples). Key subsequently lost the NRL bet, and Gillard subsequently lost the Rugby World Cup bet.

The son of a musical father and a pupil of the Royal Swedish Academy in Stockholm, he studied piano, but mastered the oboe and violin as well. In 1856–57 he studied counterpoint at the Leipzig Conservatory with Ernst Richter; there, in a musical culture that bore the imprint of Mendelssohn, he became familiar with the music of Robert Schumann and also with that of Richard Wagner. On his return to Stockholm he worked as a theatre conductor, and at the Royal Swedish Opera as choirmaster and eventually assistant conductor. He wrote several operettas (The Devil’s First Try, 1856) and incidental music for about 80 plays, such as a Swedish translation of Schiller's Die Jungfrau von Orleans (\\"The Maid of Orleans\\"). His influence can be detected in the music of later Swedish Romantic composers, Hugo Alfvén and Wilhelm Peterson-Berger. Söderman died aged 43. His music is virtually unknown outside Sweden.

Ltd., inspired by the earlier Fleuss system, and adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. Design Davis breathing apparatus tested at the submarine escape test tank at HMS Dolphin, Gosport, 14 December 1942 The DSEA rig chiefly addressed the problem of anoxia threatening a person ascending through water, by providing oxygen; and the associated risk of lung over-pressure injury as underwater pressure reduces with reducing depth, which it addressed by managing oxygen pressures. It also provided assistance with buoyancy, both in the ascent and after reaching the surface. The risk of decompression illness due to ascending too fast could be addressed by associated equipment; any other escape requirements, such as means of summoning help once the surface was reached, were not considered. The apparatus itself comprises a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag, which contains a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately 56 litres of oxygen at a pressure of 120 bar. The cylinder is equipped with a control valve and is connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admits oxygen to the bag and charges it to the pressure of the surrounding water. The canister of CO2 absorbent inside the breathing bag is connected to a mouthpiece by a flexible corrugated tube; breathing is through the mouth only, the nose being closed by a clip. Goggles are also provided as a standard part of the apparatus. The breathing/buoyancy bag is fitted with a non-return release valve which allows air to escape from the bag as the user ascends towards the surface and the water pressure decreases. The wearer can close this valve on reaching the surface, the air in the breathing/buoyancy bag then serving as a life preserver. If the bag becomes deflated while the wearer is on the surface awaiting rescue, it can be refilled (for use as a lifejacket) by opening the non-return valve and blowing through the mouthpiece. The usual Royal Navy DSEA rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of the main breathing/buoyancy bag to help keep the wearer afloat after reaching the surface even if he had exhausted the air in the breathing/buoyancy bag. This emergency bag was inflated by an \\"Oxylet\\" canister inside it - a small steel oxygen cylinder which was opened by breaking its weakened neck and wrenching sharply. It also had a speed- retarding drogue, which was a rubber apron unrolled and held out horizontally by the wearer as he ascended, dramatically reducing his speed of ascent through water resistance to avoid decompression illness. Operational service Lionel 'Buster' Crabb, RNVR, using the DSEA at Gibraltar in April 1944. The Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus was the first or nearly the first rebreather to be made in quantity. Adopted by the Royal Navy in 1929, DSEA was used with limited success to assist crew members to escape from several sunken submarines, for example HMS Poseidon in 1931, HMS Thetis in 1939 and HMS Perseus in 1941. A small version of the DSEA, the Amphibious Tank Escape Apparatus (ATEA) was produced for use by the crews of amphibious DD tanks such as those used during the Normandy landings. There were instances, mostly during WWII, of the DSEA being used for swimming down from the surface, i.e. for early scuba diving. In WWII it was also notably used by the Underwater Working Party at Gibraltar led by Lt. Lionel \\"Buster\\" Crabb, and worn at times by frogmen piloting 'Sleeping Beauty' Motorised Submersible Canoes.

He won five Commonwealth Games gold medals and claimed a total of nine individual and six relay titles at the Australian Championships, before retiring at the age of 21 due to financial pressures. After showing promise at an early age, O'Brien was sent to Sydney to train under renowned coach Forbes Carlile and his breaststroke assistant Terry Gathercole. He competed in his first national championships in 1962 at the age of 15, winning the 220 yard breaststroke to gain selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, where he won both the 110 and breaststroke and the 4 × 110 yd medley relay. He won both breaststroke events at the 1963 Australian Championships, repeating the feat for the next three years. In 1964, O'Brien went to the Tokyo Olympics and came from third at the 150 m mark to win the gold medal. He added a bronze in the medley relay. O'Brien successfully defended both his breaststroke titles at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica before retiring to support his family. Swimming officials persuaded him to make a comeback for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, as Australia did not have a breaststroker, and after a crash diet, he finished sixth in the 100 m event but failed to reach the final in the 200 m event. He then retired and went into the television industry.  Early years  O'Brien grew up in the rural town of Wellington, 360 kilometres (225 miles) from Sydney.Andrews, pp. 325-326. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but she preferred horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.Howell, p. 171. After winning all the breaststroke events at the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole.Gordon, p. 358. Carlile was regarded as the leading swimming coach in Australia at the time. At age 13, O'Brien was already a large teenager, weighing in at 82.6 kg. He only trained with Gathercole during holidays, when his father could take him to Sydney; Jim Wilkins, a Catholic priest in Bathurst, supervised him according to Gathercole's program while he was in the countryside. Within a year, O'Brien rose from being a country carnival champion to a national-level athlete, despite the death of his father in the same year.  International debut  In 1962, O'Brien gained selection for the Australian swimming team at the age of 15 when he won the 220 yard (yd) breaststroke at his first Australian Championships in the time of 2 minutes (min) 41.8 seconds (s). He added a second gold as part of the New South Wales team that won the 4 × 100 m medley relay in a time of 4 min 18.3 s. His performances gained him selection for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth. At his first international competition, he won gold in each of his three events. He competed in the and breaststroke, defeating fellow Australian William Burton in both events with times of 1 min 11.4s and 2 min 38.1 s, respectively. He then completed his campaign with a victory in the 4 × 110 yd medley relay, combining with Julian Carroll, Kevin Berry and David Dickson to complete the race in a time of 4 min 12.4 s.Howell, p. 173. In 1963, O'Brien captured the breaststroke double at the Australian Championships, setting personal bests in both events, and was a member of the New South Wales team that won the medley relay. His performances earned him selection for an overseas tour to Europe with the Australian team, competing in the Soviet Union, Germany and England before visiting Japan and Hong Kong. O'Brien defended his breaststroke double at the 1964 Australian Championships, lowering his times to 1 min 8.1 s and 2 min 32.6 s for the 100 metres (m) and 200 m breaststroke respectively. He capped off his campaign as well as a third consecutive medley relay triumph for New South Wales. Within a year, he had reduced his times in the two events by more than 3%. As O'Brien was widely regarded as Australia's best breaststroker, he was selected for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. O'Brien joined the rest of the team for the national camp before the Olympics in Ayr in northern Queensland, where he trained under head coach Don Talbot. O'Brien described Talbot as a \\"slavedriver\\", but felt that the experience was invaluable.Howell, p. 172.  Olympic gold  Arriving in Tokyo, O'Brien was nominated in the 200 m event and the medley relay; the 100 m event was yet to be included in the Olympic program. The favourites for the 200 m breaststroke were Chet Jastremski of the United Statesthe world record holderand Georgy Prokopenko of the Soviet Union. Gathercole had modelled O'Brien's technique on that of Jastremski, attempting to refine and smoothen it. Years after O'Brien retired, Harry Gallagher said that \\"Ian O'Brien has an almost faultless style and is a great example for Australian youngsters to copy\\". O'Brien was known for the strength that his torso generated, and his powerful kicks; sports science experiments showed that his vertical jump was especially strong. O'Brien was also known for his efficient start off the block. He often gained a lead of approximately a metre from his dive and underwater glide at the start, and was able to complete 50 m in 31.0 s.Atkinson, p. 114. During the final training sessions in Tokyo, Talbot organised time trials for the Australians, which were held in front of opposition swimmers in an attempt to intimidate them. O'Brien posted a time of 2 min 33 s, which Talbot felt had a negative psychological effect on O'Brien's opponents. When competition started, O'Brien swam an Olympic record to win the first heat by 2.0 s. He posted a time of 2 min 31.4 s, reducing the previous Olympic mark by 5.8 s, an indication of how much the world record had fallen in the preceding four years. However, in the next heat, Egon Henninger of Germany immediately lowered the mark, and by the end of the heats, O'Brien was the fourth fastest qualifier for the semifinals, with both Prokopenko and Jastremski posting faster times. O'Brien lowered Henninger's Olympic record by winning the second semifinal in a time of 2 min 28.7 s, after Jastremski had won the first semifinal in a time that was 3.4 s slower than O'Brien. This made O'Brien the fastest qualifier for the final, with a time that was 1.0 s faster than the next qualifier Prokopenko, who came second to him in the second semifinal. O'Brien planned to swim the race at an even pace and record even splits for the first and second half of the race. He was mindful of not chasing Jastremski, who was known for an aggressive opening style, which resulted in a faster first half. In the final, Jastremski attacked from the outset as expected, while O'Brien raced with a characteristically even pace. After being fourth at the halfway mark behind Jastremski, Prokopenko and Henninger, O'Brien panicked and accelerated in the third 50 m and overtook Jastremski, leaving the American in fourth place. He then moved past Henninger, before overtaking Prokopenko. O'Brien's acceleration in the third meant that he tired at the end, but he had enough energy to fend off Prokopenko in the late stages to win the gold medal in a new world record time of 2 min 27.8 s, a margin of 0.4 s, with Jastremski a further 1.4 s in arrears. O'Brien had reduced his personal best time by more than four seconds during the Olympics to claim an upset win. The Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. It turned out to be a close call for the Australians, as they finished fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2 s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' backstroke leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4 s behind the American leaders. O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1 min 7.8 s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7 s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany in a time of 4 min 2.3 s, missing the silver by 0.7 s.Gordon, p. 355.  Later career  O'Brien completed a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, but in a year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1 min 11.1 s and 2 min 38.6 s respectively. He completed a fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1 min 11.8 s and 2 min 41.6 s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests,Howell, pp. 171-174. but it was still enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16 kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1 min 8.2 s and 2 min 29.3 s respectively. His winning run in the 4 × 100 m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover. In 1967, O'Brien skipped the Australian Championships because he had no sponsorship and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200 m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7 kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, O'Brien placed second in his heat of the 200 m breaststroke in a time of 2 min 36.8 s, which placed him 13th. He was eliminated, having been 2.9 s slower than the last-placed qualifier for the final. The eventual winner posted a time 0.9 s slower than that of O'Brien four years earlier. O'Brien did better in the newly introduced 100 m event, winning his heat in a time of 1 min 8.9 s to qualify second-fastest for the semifinals. O'Brien scraped into the final after coming second in his semifinal in a time of 1 min 9.0 s. It was the barest of margins; O'Brien was the slowest qualifier and could not be electronically separated from the ninth-fastest semifinalist, with judges being used to decide the placings. O'Brien went on to finish sixth in a time of 1 min 8.6 s. O'Brien narrowly missed a medal in the 4 × 100 m medley relay. Along with Michael Wenden, Robert Cusack and Karl Byrom, the Australian quartet won their heat and entered the final as the equal fifth fastest qualifier. In the final, O'Brien swam his leg in 1 min 8.6 s, which was only the fifth fastest breaststroke leg. Australia were fourth at the end of each leg, except O'Brien's, when they were third. Australia eventually missed out on the bronze by 0.1 s to the Soviet Union. O'Brien admitted that his training had been insufficient for Olympic standards, noting that \\"I needed to put on another thousand kilometres in training\\". O'Brien also rued the absence of Talbot to motivate him to work, and had a further accident at the Olympic Village when his fingers were slammed by a closing window. Under competition regulations, he was not allowed to bind his hand during competition.Howell, p. 174.  Out of the pool  At age 21, O'Brien retired after the 1968 Olympics, so he could concentrate solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming career had caused substantial financial stress for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, so that he could support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held for more than ten years. He then worked for Channel Ten for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal.

The concept is premised on the belief that a person is first born physically and at a later date is born for a second time spiritually, usually when he undergoes the ritual of passage that initiates him into a school for Vedic studies.Dvija, Encyclopedia Britannica (2014) The term also refers to members of the three varnas in the traditional Hindu social system, or social classes — the Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (warriors), and Vaishyas (merchants) — whose Sanskara of Upanayana initiation was regarded as a second or spiritual birth. The word Dvija is neither found in any Vedas and Upanishads, nor is it found in any Vedanga literature such as the Shrauta- sutras or Grihya-sutras. The word scarcely appears in Dharmasutras literature. Increasing mentions of it appear in Dharmasastras text of mid to late 1st- millennium CE texts. The presence of the word Dvija is a marker that the text is likely a medieval era Indian text, however the Mahabharata, which dates back to at least 400 BCE mentions the word Dvijottama, thus contradicting the claim.Holy Bhagavad Gita, , Chapter 1, Verse 7  The meaning of the two births  The Upanayanam thread ceremony marking initiation as a Dvija. \\"Dvija\\" means \\"twice-born\\": the first birth is physical, while the second birth is a 'spiritual' one. The second 'birth' occurs when one takes up fulfilling a role in society, at the time of Upanayana initiation ceremony. For example, a Brahmin is initiated into school to study and pursue Brahmopadesha (preach, counsel) in the matter of the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality. Traditionally, a Kshatraiya would start learning the use of arms, while a Vaishya would start a trade apprenticeship. The premise of the Dvija concept was that a person is born physically through his parents at home, spiritually through his teacher at school (gurukul) who helps the student form the mind and realize the self.Joel Mlecko (1982), The Guru in Hindu Tradition, Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 33-61  Literature  The word Dvija, and its equivalent such as Dvijati, is neither found in any Vedas, any Upanishad, nor in any Vedanga literature such as the Vyakarana, Shiksha, Nirukta, Chandas, Shrauta-sutras or Grihya-sutras. Words such as Dvijanman appear in chapter 1.60 of Rigveda, but the context is not human beings, but \\"fire\\" once born in the heaven and then brought and born again on the earth. The term is missing in all theological and rituals-related text preceding the 2nd-century BCE, as well as the earliest Dharmasutras texts. It makes the first appearance in Gautama Dharmasutra but not in the context later understood. The first significant appearance of the word Dvija occurs in the Manu Smriti (166 mentions) composed between 2nd to 3rd century CE. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed in 4th or 5th-century CE mentions the word less often (40 times). The massive Hindu epics, the Valmiki Ramayana and the Mahabharata mention the word Dvija 214 and 1535 times respectively. This, states Patrick Olivelle, suggest that Dvija is not a Vedic or ancient tradition of Hinduism, but an innovation that appeared sometime in the 1st millennium CE. This word is a significant scholarly marker to identify a text as likely from medieval India.  Implications  Dvija, in medieval Indian texts, refers to a member of the first three varnas – Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. The Asvalayana sutra indicates that a non-dvija child may also be inducted into the Dvija category, if he wishes to pursue the duties associated with these varnas. The initiation ceremony (upanayana) invests the male initiates with a sacred thread, a loop worn next to the skin over the left shoulder and across the right hip. This Dvija-ceremony was recommended in medieval era texts for the Brahmins (priests and teachers), Kshatriyas (warriors), and Vaishyas (merchants) before they began their schools. In contrast, the Shudras were considered ineligible for Dvija-ceremony and formal schooling in these texts. Some Sanskrit texts present a different view. The Mahabharata, for example, states that a Shudra who is self-restrained and pure conduct is like a Dvija, and suggests that Shudras can possess Vedic knowledge. Since the 19th century, the concept of Dvija has been increasingly questioned. Women have become students of Sanskrit and Vedic subjects, notably in India’s public institutions of higher learning, have chanted Vedic verses, and have even offered their services as specialists in Brahmanical rituals. The Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to guru and education was limited to men and to certain varna (social classes or castes).KS Murthy (1993), Vedic Hermeneutics, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 14-17 The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or on varna. The Upanishads assert that one's birth does not determine one's eligibility for spiritual knowledge, only one's effort and sincerity matters. Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras, such as Paraskara Grhyasutra, Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya Smriti, state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge; while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas, unavailable to Shudra and women.Arvind Sharma (2000), Classical Hindu Thought: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, , pages 147-158 The Brahmanical centres of learning were open to all the Dvija castes, states Romila Thapar, and they \\"appear to have attracted mainly the Brahmin students\\". The Dvija restrictions may be theoretical, because most students learnt their economically useful skills through apprenticeship within their family or at guilds. Other scholars also treat the Dvija concept as theory, because in reality ancient and medieval India had artisan schools where all social classes including Shudras learnt skills, and these artisans and workers built sophisticated artwork, products and large temples.Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Volume 71, Number 281, pages 224-230Samuel Parker (1987), Artistic practice and education in India: A historical overview, Journal of Aesthetic Education, pages 123-141RN Misra (2011), Silpis in Ancient India: Beyond their Ascribed Locus in Ancient Society, Social Scientist, Vol. 39, No. 7/8, pages 43-54 In practice, state Stella Kramrisch and others, the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society.Stella Kramrisch (1994), Exploring India's Sacred Art (Editor: Barbara Miller), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 59-66Hartmut Scharfe (2007), Education in Ancient India: Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill Academic, , pages 75-79, 102-103, 197-198, 263-276Radha Mookerji (2011), Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 174-175, 270-271 Lise McKean states the guru concept has been prevalent over the range of class and caste backgrounds, and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders and a range of classes and castes.Lise McKean (1996), Divine Enterprise: Gurus and the Hindu Nationalist Movement, University of Chicago Press, , pages 14-22, 57-58 During the bhakti movement of Hinduism, which started in about mid 1st millennium CE, the gurus included women and members of all varna.John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, , pages 304-310Richard Kieckhefer and George Bond (1990), Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions, University of California Press, , pages 116-122Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, , pages 423-431 See also *Baptism *Fraternity *Freemasonry *Religious initiation rites Notes  References  Category:Titles and occupations in Hinduism ","title":"Dvija"},{"id":"5058491","text":"Berringa is a small township in west-central Victoria, Australia. It is situated in Golden Plains Shire, about 43 km southwest of Ballarat. The township and surrounding rural community are located on the southern extremity of a range of Silurian slate and sandstone rock. The area was a centre of intensive gold mining in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The township was known as Kangaroo prior to 1900, the Post Office opening in January 1878 as Kangaroo, being renamed Berringa in 1900 and closing in 1955. Gold has been mined at Berringa since the 1850s, with the main period of production being from 1898 to 1917, during which time about 280,000 ounces of gold were extracted from five major mines and several other, smaller operations. Mining continued after World War I on a lesser scale until the area was abandoned in the 1950s. Ballarat Goldfields NL, through its subsidiary, Berringa Resources Pty. Ltd., still conducts exploration operations at Berringa. Gold mining had a direct effect on Berringa's population, which increased from 150 in 1899 to a peak of about 4000 in 1908. By 1922, with the gold mining boom over, the population had fallen to about 100. As of the 2016 census, Berringa and the surrounding area had a population of 167. The Berringa district is showing a modest population revival with the tree change phenomenon. The district was the site of a significant bushfire in February 1995.

Entering service with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1955 as a basic to advanced trainer, it served in this role until 1975. Later, it was used in the Forward Air Control (FAC) role for target marking until 1994, after which it was retired from RAAF service. Design and development The Winjeel (from a Victorian indigenous word for \\"young eagle\\", an alternate spelling of Bunjil) was developed by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Victoria to satisfy RAAF technical requirement No.AC.77 issued in 1948. Designed to replace both the Tiger Moth and the CAC Wirraway, the first two prototype CA-22 aircraft were flown in February 1951. However, it proved a very stable aircraft making it almost impossible to spin, and with this being a required part of pilot training the tail had to be redesigned as a result. Sixty two production CA-25 aircraft were subsequently built and given the fleet serials A85-401 to A85-462. Operational history The first aircraft flew in February 1955, and deliveries began that September. The first Winjeel entered service with No. 1 Basic Flying Training School (1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, near Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. The last aircraft was delivered in August 1957. For most of its service life, the Winjeel was used as a basic trainer at RAAF Base Point Cook in Victoria, after 1 BFTS was transferred there in 1958. The Winjeel remained in service with the RAAF as a basic trainer until 1968, when the Macchi MB-326 replaced it in this role as part of the RAAF's adoption of an \\"all through\\" jet training concept. The failure of this concept ultimately ensured that the Winjeel was retained in the training role until 1975, when it was replaced by the New Zealand-built PAC CT/4A Airtrainer. After this, a few Winjeels were used in the Forward Air Control (FAC) role. Initially operated by No. 4 Flight, they were equipped with smoke bombs for target marking. By 1994 there were 4 in service with No. 76 Squadron based at RAAF Base Williamtown,Air International, December 1994, p. 322. but later that year they were replaced by the Pilatus PC-9 and subsequently retired.

Originally serialized in Shōjo Comic, the individual chapters were published in ten tankōbon volumes by Shogakukan from May 2003 until August 2005. The series focus on fraternal twins Yori and Iku, who fall in love with one another despite being siblings. The manga series was adapted into a one-episode original video animation that was released in May 2005 and a live-action film starring Jun Matsumoto and Nana Eikura that premiered in Japan on January 20, 2007. A ten volume spin-off series focusing on Yori's upperclassmen Takuma Kakinouchi and his childhood sweetheart Mayu Taneda was serialized in Shōjo Comic from December 2005 through August 2008. It is called Boku no Hatsukoi o Kimi ni Sasagu (abbreviated to BokuKimi) and means \\"I Give My First Love to You\\". Plot Yori and Iku Yuki are twin brother and sister, who have been extremely close since they were born. During their childhood, Yori used to tell their parents that he would marry Iku. While their parents brushed this off as an innocent childhood fantasy, Yori knew that his feelings were more than an innocent crush on his sister. When they are fifteen, his feelings have grown stronger than before. Yori has by now understood that he has fallen deeply and hopelessly in love with Iku, which makes him feel ashamed. Due to that they share a bedroom, Yori finds it harder and harder to resist his feelings for her, so he begins to distance himself from her and acts coldly to her. Iku is hurt and shaken by his harsh treatment towards her, but she tries to remain cheerful and make him smile. One day during school, Yori gets into a fight after a classmate makes fun of Iku, and gets injured. Tomoka Kusunoki, Iku's best friend, tends to his injury and tries to comfort him. In midst of this, she suddenly kisses him and professes her love to him. When she asks him if she is good enough for him, he sees this as an opportunity to surpass his feelings for Iku. He proceeds to kiss her and has sex with her at a hotel. This encounter, however, does nothing to help him forget his lust for Iku. Tomoka mistakenly thinks that Yori reciprocates her feelings and calls him her boyfriend. Yori, however, decides to hide this from Iku so she won't get upset. He later tries a new strategy: go to an out-of-town high school. Days later, Yori and Iku get into a fight after Iku talks about her dreams of having a boyfriend and going on dates. Yori gets really mad about this and yells at Iku to shut up. Iku does but starts crying. While she is crying, he kisses her, which shocks her, and he confesses his love to her. Iku is taken aback by his confession and rejects his advances because he is her brother. However, she sees the sadness on his face and realizes that, while she is uncertain if she loves him more than a brother, she may lose him by rejecting him. She kisses him and feels uncomfortable by it, which Yori notices and tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him. Over the next several days, they try to begin an intimate relationship, with Iku slowly growing adjusted to Yori's advances, and keeping their parents in the dark. Haruka Yano, Yori's best friend, immediately notices the twins' closeness but doesn't tell them. Iku continued to be torn between her guilt of committing twincest and her desire to remain together with Yori. Her guilt, however, completely disappears when she discovers that Yori is planning to enroll in a different high school and that he has been seeing Tomoka. She tries to have sex with Yori, but in the process, he rejects her because she still doesn't love him yet. The next day, as she sees Tomoka clinging to Yori, Iku realizes that she has finally fallen in love with Yori. After confessing to him, they skip school and flee to a church, where they remember playing at when they were little. They try to have sex in the church, but Iku tells him to stop because she feels that God is watching them. Yori agrees and decide to go home. Soon after, during school, Tomoka talks with Iku and their friends about her first time with Yori, which angers Iku. Yori comes in and tells Tomoka that their relationship is over before leaving with Iku. Tomoka smiles while crying and doesn't understand why he broke up with her so suddenly. When someone mentions that Yori probably has someone else he likes, she quickly realizes that that person is Iku. Iku fights with Yori over his indiscretion with Tomoka. He hugs her as she tries to get away from him, but when she sees him cry, she gives into her feelings and hugs him back. Later that day, Iku has Yori meet up with her and tells him that she wants to make love to him right now, which shocks but pleases him. They go to a hotel, and after Iku is initially apprehensive, they finally have sex for the first time. Yori is thrilled that Iku is his, but feels guilty and asks for God to punish only him. Days later, they graduate from junior high school and Iku realizes that Yori still plans to leave for a different high school. Yori tells Yano the truth of his relationship with Iku, which Yano knew but he asks why is he still leaving. Yori says that he is torn between his desire to protect this relationship versus the obligation to destroy it. Yori tries to comfort Iku, who asks why he wants to go. Yori says he doesn't want to leave, but if he stays, they can't be a normal couple. However, if they were another city, where no one knows them, they could be a couple. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch. Yori arrives at his high school, and to his horror, he finds that Tomoka has enrolled in the same school. She tries to get him to take her back, but he rejects her, which doesn't seem to bother her. For their sixteenth birthday, Yori and Iku receive cell phones, which makes easier for them to stay in contact. Iku visits with Yori as much as possible because Yori is allowed limited visits outside of the school. He befriends Takuma Kakinouchi and his girlfriend Mayu Taneda, who act as his confidants. For his birthday present to her, Yori gives Iku a diamond clover ring as a promise of eternal love. Separated from Yori for weeks at a time, Iku is placed in the care of Yano, who acts as her protector. Yano helps the twins see each other at school and even arranges them to spend the night together. When he tells Iku that he knows about the relationship, he assures her that he will keep it a secret. However, as he spends time with her, Yano slowly falls in love with Iku. Yori vows that he will never give Iku up, and the two best friends have a friendly rivalry over Iku, who is oblivious to Yano's feelings. The twins' parents mistake Yano as Iku's boyfriend and take an instant liking to him, but he says that they are not a couple. When he does tell Iku that he likes her, Iku rejects him because she loves Yori. Yori soon realizes that Tomoka is determined to get revenge against him and Iku for breaking up with her. She has them get caught in Yori's room by fellow students several times in order to expel him, as girls are forbidden to be in boys' dorms. When Yori gets light punishments for the offenses, she takes a cell phone picture of the two kissing and threatens to send it to everyone they know if he doesn't sleep with her. When he appears to accept the deal, he deletes the picture and tells her to leave him and Iku alone. Tomoka, however, refuses to listen and continues with her plan to expel him. Some time later, while Yano is at Iku's house, her father comes home and happily tells his wife that he ran into their longtime friend, Dr. Yuugo Mori, which takes her aback. He tells her that Yuugo has a daughter who is the same age as Yori and Iku, and promised to have Yori engaged to the girl. The twins' mother refuses this and asks about when he said the girl is similar to Yori. This sounds suspicious to Yano, who tells Yori that he thinks Iku might not be his sister. Yori rejects this possibility, even though he secretly hopes it is true. When Iku sneaks into the school to visit Yori, Tomoka hires a group of classmates to rape Iku. Fortunately, Yori catches them and punishes them and Tomoka. The school principal decides to expel Yori for continuing to let Iku into his dorm. Iku is happy of the news, which annoys Tomoka and calls her stupid. Yori defends Iku from Tomoka's insult, and she threatens to tell his mother about the twincestuous relationship. He doesn't believe her, but the twins find that their mother has overheard the conversation. Again, Yano lies, saying that Tomoka was joking and Iku is his girlfriend. Their mother does not believe them, but doesn't say it out of fear, and takes the twins home. Yori enrolls into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo's daughter Azusa. She notices that Yori and Iku don't resemble each other while she looks just like Yori. Azusa tells her father of how different the twins are, and after he invites the Yuki family over to his house and he sees Yori for the first time, he confronts their mother. Yori witnesses an intimate moment between the two and suspects that they may have had an affair. He later finds Iku's unfilled birth certificate and photographs of his parents with Yuugo. Azusa confesses to Yori that she believes they are half-siblings, and then Yuugo confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and he believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly uses a piece of Yori's hair to do a DNA test, which confirms his suspicions. He tells the twins' mother of the news and is shocked when she admits she knows Yori is his son. She had kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Yori and Yano consulte a family friend of Yano's, who says that the unfilled birth certificate could indicate Iku was abandoned as an infant and then adopted by their parents. After this, Yori makes his feelings for Iku clear to his mother, who reacts in shock. She tells Yori to stay away from Iku because they are siblings. Yori doesn't believe her and threatens to destroy the family if she tells anyone about the relationship. With his mother horrified, he takes Iku to their room. As they are making love, their mother confronts them and tells them that they are siblings, but Yori asks her to answer his question about Iku's birth certificate. She tells the twins and their father that they are twins, but half-twins; they are the result of heteropaternal superfecundation. She tells them that Yori is her son with Yuugo Mori and Iku is her daughter by her husband. Sixteen years ago, when she was about to marry her husband, Yuugo confessed his love to her, and although she had feelings for him, she refused him. At that moment, he kissed her and they had sex. She tried to forget about the betrayal and slept with her husband on the same day. Three months later, she found out she was pregnant with twins and was unsure who the father was, until the twins were born and saw the physical difference between them. She becomes physically ill after telling the story and lashes out at Yori for his twincest with Iku. Realizing that they may be separated now that their parents know their secret, Yori and Iku run away from home with Yano's help and stay at his beach cottage. Yori tells Iku that if they had a child together, their parents will never have to separate them. Iku is hesitant at this idea, but agrees, and they make love in an attempt to conceive. Later on, they go to a church to pray, and Yori realizes Iku cannot give sacrifice their family to be with him and decides the right thing to do is to end the relationship. They decide to return home and reconcile with their parents. Yori decides to leave the family and go somewhere he can never be found so that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Before departing, he cuts Iku's hair from what it looked like from her childhood at her request, and he slips out when she falls asleep. When she wakes up and finds him gone, Iku falls into a deep depression. However, she soon realizes that she never did anything for Yori and resolves to find him no matter how long it takes. Over the next ten years, Iku manages to get into a university and becomes a sales representative for Yano's company. Yano has frequently asked Iku to marry him, but she rejects him. During a trip to England, she goes to a library because she thinks it would be a place Yori would go to. They finally pass each other, but don't recognize the other until after a few seconds, and turn around and embrace. In the climax, Yori states that he is still in love with Iku.

A review of the second volume of the manga commends the author's art as \\"very pretty\\". It also comments on the incestuous relationship \\"Between those two brother and sister are sometimes pushed a bit too far and I found Yuki a bit too silly at times. But that also gives charm to the character.\\" PlaneteBD's Faustine Lillaz comments on the manga's art which \\"barely save the day.

Anime Reviews criticized the hour length of the OVA, feeling its compression of the original manga story causing Yori's feelings for his sister to seem \\"extremely abrupt and out of left field\\". Noting that the OVA adaptation departed from the usual \\"incest- taboo\\" set up, Ross considered the premise \\"Freudian\\" and \\"very unrealistic.\\" Though he found the animation itself average, Ross praised the background art as varying \\"from gorgeous to amazing\\".

One of a small group of survivors of the camp's prisoner revolt in August 1943, Glazar described his experiences in an autobiographical book, Trap with a Green Fence: Survival in Treblinka (1992). Early life and family Glazar was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, to a Jewish-Bohemian family who spoke both Czech and German. His father served in the Austro- Hungarian Army before independence.Wolfgang Benz, \\"Foreword\\", in Richard Glazar, Trap with a Green Fence: Survival in Treblinka, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1995, viii–viii. His parents divorced in 1922, and his mother married a wealthy leather merchant, Quido Bergmann, who already had two children, Karel and Adolf. Karel died in the Austrian Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp on May 17, 1942. Adolf went in October 1939 to Denmark with the Youth Aliyah organization, escaped in October 1943 to Sweden (Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany 1940-45). In 1944-45 he served as a volunteer in the Free Czechoslovak Army in UK & France, and was later awarded the Czechoslovakian War Cross. He later earned the degree of B.Sc. in dairy technology at the Agriculture University of Denmark. Richard and Adolf met after WWII and continued to have contact until the end of Richard's life. Red Cross. Glazar's father died of pneumonia in the Soviet Union, to which he had escaped from the Nisko reservation in the General Government of occupied Poland; some 1,100 Czech Jews had been deported there by the Nazis in 1939. Glazar's mother survived both Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, and was the only member of his family left when he returned to Prague in 1945. His stepbrother Adolf Dasha Bergmann also survived after having served in the Czech army in France and was in Prague, when Richard returned to Prague in 1945. Education Glazar was accepted into the Charles University in Prague in June 1939. He was originally enrolled as a philosophy student, but anti-Jewish legislation after the German occupation forced him into a course reading economics. His entire family had the chance to move to England at Christmas in 1938, when his stepfather obtained a permit. His stepfather did not take this opportunity, as he did not want to leave behind all that he had built up in Czechoslovakia. On November 17, 1939, all Czech universities were closed until the end of the war, following student demonstrations against the execution of a number of their fellow students. This act would have been one of the Glazar family's first warnings of the horrific events to follow, and fearing for his safety, his family sent him to a farm outside Prague in 1940. Glazar stayed there for two years. On September 12, 1942, he was transported to the Nazi concentration camp or ghetto at Theresienstadt (previously the fortified town of Terezin, located 35 miles north of Prague). Following the German occupation of the rest of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939, Theresienstadt became a holding area for transports to other concentration camps, such as Auschwitz. In Terezin, Glazar met Karl Unger, who became a close friend. Glazar was to stay in Terezin for only one month, before he and Unger were transported to Treblinka on October 8, 1942. Treblinka Glazar wrote his story down after the war,Benz 1995, ix. and had part of it published in 1967 in a Czech magazine, Mezinárodní politika. In 1985 he was interviewed by Claude Lanzmann for the documentary Shoah (1985). When Glazar moved to Switzerland after the Prague Spring, his memoir was published in full in German as Die Falle mit dem grünen Zaun: Überleben in Treblinka (1992).Samuel Moyn, A Holocaust Controversy: The Treblinka Affair in Postwar France, University of New England Press, 2005, 137. An English translation, Trap with a Green Fence: Survival in Treblinka, was published in 1995 by Northwestern University Press. In Shoah, Glazar described his arrival at Treblinka: New arrivals at Treblinka were ordered to strip, then herded into gas chambers disguised as communal showers; exhaust gas was pumped in instead of water. Glazar was instead selected for forced labor along with a friend, Karel Unger. He described in his book the packing of victims' clothes for shipment to Germany, and how the gold from teeth was extracted and, together with coins and jewelry, added to the German loot. Food brought by the victims helped sustain both the SS and the Ukrainian guards, along with inmates who would steal them at the unloading ramp. The revolt After the big transports from Grodno and Białystok Ghettos in January 1943, in February and March 1943 no transports came into the camp. The Sonderkommando had virtually no food, which made the Jewish inmates realize that their lives depended on the transports arriving regularly.Glazar 1995, 91. It was this knowledge that drove them to try to escape. The first escape attempt was planned for January 1943 and was code-named \\"The Hour\\". The idea was that at a specified time, all those working for the camp would attack the SS and Ukrainian guards, steal their weapons, and attack the camp Kommandantur. Unfortunately, this did not proceed, as typhus broke out, and many inmates either died, were hospitalized, or were too sick to participate. The escape that actually worked was less violent and ambitious: on August 2, 1943, men broke out through a damaged gate during a prisoner's revolt. Most of the escapees were arrested close to the camp, but Glazar and Unger fled from the area and made their way across Poland. While on the run, they were arrested by a forester, but managed to convince him that they were Czechs working for \\"Organisation Todt\\" (a Nazi construction and engineering group in Poland). Both men were later sent to Mannheim in Germany, to work for Heinrich Lanz as immigrant workers, using falsified papers. Life after the war Following the end of the war, when Glazar and Unger were liberated by the Americans, Glazar attended the trials of many of the Nazis associated with Treblinka, including Franz Stangl. Glazar also went on to study in Prague, Paris and London, and received a degree in economics. In 1968 he and his family moved to Switzerland after the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the armies of the Warsaw Pact. Glazar helped Michael Peters, the founder of the Aktion Reinhard Camps (a network of private Holocaust researchers), build a model of Treblinka. Glazar committed suicide on December 20, 1997 by jumping out of a window in Prague after the death of his wife, leaving the model unfinished.

Aircraft Handlers are responsible for the safe movement, launching (taking off) and recovering (landing) of all aircraft onboard ships within the Royal Navy and some of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. They are also responsible for aircraft crash rescue fire fighting duties on board Royal Navy ships and at Royal Naval Air Stations. The Aircraft Handling branch of the Fleet Air Arm in the Royal Navy was formed in 1945. Beforehand the duties of Aircraft Handlers were performed by members of other branches of the Royal Navy, many of whom transferred to the new branch upon its formation. :\\"Specialist aircraft handling, crash rescue and fire fighting are required at sea on all ships with aircraft embarked. These skills are provided by the Aircraft Handler ratings who are also employed ashore for fire fighting duties, principally at Royal Naval Air Stations.\\" – MOD (Navy) Some 10,000 men have served in the branch since its formation in 1945, and many of them are still scattered around the country and worldwide. Only about 10% of these are members of the Aircraft Handlers Association. The Aircraft Handlers Association is there for past and present serving members of the branch. It produces a quarterly publication that has articles and news that is of interest to all members of the branch. It also organizes annual reunions and events so members can catch up with old \\"shipmates\\". Today the Aircraft Handling branch is made up of around 450 personnel who serve on various ships and at Royal Naval Air Stations. Training New recruits into the Aircraft Handling branch initially complete basic training with other Naval recruits at in Cornwall for 10 weeks. Here they are trained in the basic skills required to serve in the British armed forces/Royal Navy. Upon successful completion of basic training all recruits into the Aircraft Handling branch then proceed to RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall; here they are instructed at the Royal Naval School of Flight Deck Operations (RNSFDO). The training at RNSFDO is around 6 months and covers the two key skills required of an Aircraft Handler. The first phase is fire fighting, which sees recruits learn aircraft crash rescue fire fighting skills, however new recruits also learn skills required for domestic fire fighting, the safe use and control of breathing apparatus, road traffic incidents and various other skills that would be required as would be for the civilian fire service. The second phase of training is Aircraft Handling which sees recruits learning the skills required for the safe movement, take off and landing of aircraft on board Royal Navy ships and at Royal Naval air stations. The training for this role is carried out on a full-size mock-up flight deck known as HMS Siskin (Dummy Deck). HMS Siskin is largely made up to replicate the Invicible-class aircraft carrier but can also be adapted to the roles of smaller ships such as frigates and destroyers. New recruits are now also able to gain NVQ qualifications in firefighting skills. Organisation The Aircraft Handling branch is part of the Fleet Air Arm. The Aircraft Handling branch is also the Royal Navy's fire service and is known to the Royal Navy as the Royal Navy Fire Rescue Service (RNFRS). The RNFRS, Royal Air Force Fire and Rescue Service and British Army counterparts are now collectively under an organisation known as Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation (DFRMO). Badges and motto Aircraft Handlers are sometimes known as \\"Chockheads\\", which was the name given to them when they first formed by other branches within the Royal Navy, based on some of the tasks that they used to carry out. The badge of the branch is a similar design to that of a Naval Air Squadron. The badge is made up to replicate the two key roles carried out by the branch. Within the badge background is the sea with fire raising from it. In front of this is a Harrier jet aircraft with two hands cupped around it. The motto of the branch in Latin is \\"Nostris In Manibus Tuti\\", which translates in English as \\"Safe In Our Hands\\". The trade badge actually worn by Aircraft Handlers on their uniforms is a plane (Sopworth Camel) with the letter H underneath it. A star above the plane indicates the rate of naval airman, two stars indicate the rate of leading airman and a crown indicates the rate of a petty officer airman and also a chief petty officer airman. The Branch Badge of The Aircraft Handlers Badge of the Royal Navy Fire and Rescue Service Rate structure * Naval airman * Leading airman * Petty officer airman * Chief petty officer airman (often known as a chief handler) * Warrant officer All new recruits join as the rate of naval airman. Promotion up to the rates of petty officer airman are decided on selection and successful completion of an advanced professional course and command and leadership courses. Promotion from petty officer airman up to warrant officer is also decided on selection, but no further professional courses are required. Current equipment and vehicles Aircraft Handlers use various types of vehicles and equipment to complete their fire fighting tasks, most of which is the same as the equipment used by most civil fire services, with the exception of the vehicles. At Royal Naval Air Stations, Aircraft Handlers are employed mainly at fire stations where they will use two types of fire vehicle, these being the Rapid Intervention Vehicle (RIV) and the Major Foam Vehicle (MFV). They also use other types of equipment such as Drager breathing apparatus, Clan Lucas cutting equipment, various sized extending ladders and airbag lifting equipment. Aircraft Handlers also use different equipment when they are based on board ships, such as NMATT tractors, EN Mechanical Handlers and RAM to move aircraft. To carry out their fire fighting role they use fixed fire hoses from the ships system and other fire fighting equipment like 10 kg CO2 extinguishers and SF 90 foam extinguishers. Location An Aircraft Handler with a Harrier GR9 landing on at sea in 2007 Aircraft Handlers may find themselves in a variety of locations such as being on board an aircraft carrier or being at a fire station on an air station. Fire stations that Aircraft Handlers are usually based at are RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall and RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset, but some Aircraft Handlers are based at fire stations at RAF Cottesmore in Rutland and RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire. Aircraft Handlers are mostly based on board Royal Navy ships such as aircraft carriers and (Portsmouth), amphibious ships and Bulwark and the Royal Navy's helicopter carrier (Plymouth). They can also serve on board various Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships (various locations). Some Aircraft Handlers are also attached to Naval Air Squadrons which are based at Royal Naval Air Stations Yeovilton and Culdrose. HMS Illustrious Future The Royal Navy is due to increase the personnel numbers within the branch due to the Government's plans to introduce the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers into service. The new carriers and will require large numbers of Aircraft Handlers to operate the new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft that will also come into service with the new carriers. right  See also  *List of air stations of the Royal Navy  External links  *Naval Airman (Aircraft Handler) MOD(RN) *Aircraft Handlers Association Category:Fleet Air Arm Category:Royal Navy specialisms ","title":"Aircraft Handler"},{"id":"5058656","text":"South African orders, decorations and medals are those military and civilian orders, decorations and medals issued by the Government of South Africa. The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of these: Historical orders, decorations and medals =Military= =Civilian= Order of Good Hope Union of South Africa The Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, as a self-governing Dominion in the British Empire. A medal was issued to commemorate the event. As a Dominion, the Union came under the British honours system, and South Africans featured in the semi-annual British honours lists. South Africans also received British civilian decorations for bravery. The nationalist government stopped the conferment of titles and orders in 1925, and discontinued nominations for bravery awards after the Union's independence was recognised in 1931. It established its own bravery awards a few years later. The Union's civil honours thus consisted of: * Decoration  King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery (1939–61) * Commemorative Medal  Union of South Africa Commemoration Medal (1910) * War service medal  South African Medal for War Services (1945) When South Africa established its own independent honours system in 1952, the Queen's Medal for Bravery was transferred to it. The medal issued to mark Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 was also ranked as a South African award, because she was Queen of South Africa as well as of the United Kingdom and her other realms and territories. Republic of South Africa South Africa became a republic outside the Commonwealth on 31 May 1961. =1967–1986= During the 1960s and 1970s, the government developed a small range of civil honours to recognise bravery and meritorious service: * Decorations and orders  Woltemade Decoration for Bravery (1970–88)  Order of the Star of South Africa (Civilian Division) (SSA/SSAS) (1978–2002)  Order of Good Hope (1973–2003)  Decoration for Meritorious Service (DMS) (1970–86)  Civil Defence Medal for Bravery (1976–??)  Civil Defence Medal for Meritorious Service (1976–??) Order for Meritorious Service * Sports awards  State President's Sports Award (1967–94)  South African Sports Merit Award (1971–94) =1986–2002= The civil honours system was enlarged during the 1980s. In 1986, the five orders were collectively dubbed the \\"national orders\\", and a Chancery of Orders was established in the Office of the State President to administer them. These were retained after South Africa's return to the Commonwealth of Nations in 1994. The expanded honours system comprised: * Decorations and orders  Woltemade Cross for Bravery (WD/WDS) (1988–2002)  Order of the Southern Cross (OSG/OSS) (1986–2002)  Order of the Star of South Africa (Non- Military) (SSA/SSAS)(1978-2002)  Order for Meritorious Service (OMSG/OMSS) (1986–2002)  Order of Good Hope (1973–2003)  Civil Protection Medal for Bravery (1976–??)  President's Decoration for Distinguished Service (1987–??)  Civil Protection Medal for Meritorious Service (1976–??) * Sports awards  State President's Sports Award (1967–94)  South African Sports Merit Award (1971–94) Union of South Africa King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery The Union of South Africa King's Medal for Bravery was instituted in 1939 to award South African citizens for exceptional gallantry in saving life. The decoration had two grades (Gold and Silver) and had a blue ribbon with orange edges. The medal lapsed on 31 May 1961, when South Africa became a republic, albeit, outside the Commonwealth. Woltemade Decoration for Bravery The Woltemade Decoration for Bravery was a revived, republican version of the King's/Queen's Medal for Bravery. It was instituted in 1970 and was awarded until 1988, when it was replaced by the Woltemade Cross for Bravery. Woltemade Cross for Bravery The Woltemade Cross for Bravery (post-nominal letters: WD) was instituted in 1988, replacing the Woltemade Decoration, to award South African citizens for outstanding bravery in saving life. The cross had two grades (Gold and Silver) and had a blue ribbon with orange edges. The Woltemade Cross was discontinued in 2002. Current orders, decorations and medals =Military= Nkwe (Leopard) decorations for bravery The three Nkwe (Leopard) Decorations for Bravery are awarded for bravery in military operations in place of the Honoris Crux Decorations in 2003. The three Leopard Decorations are: * Nkwe ya Gauta (Golden Leopard) (post-nominal: NG), for exceptional bravery during military operations. * Nkwe ya Selefera (Silver Leopard) (post-nominal: NS), for conspicuous bravery during military operations. * Nkwe ya Boronse (Bronze Leopard) (post-nominal: NB), for bravery during military operations. Protea Decoration for Merit The three Protea Decorations for Merit are for leadership, meritorious conduct or devotion to duty in place of the previous Southern Cross Decoration, Southern Cross Medal and Military Merit Medal. The three Protea Decorations are: * iPhrothiya yeGolide (post-nominal: PG), to officers for outstanding service of the highest order and utmost devotion to duty. * iPhrothiya yeSiliva (post-nominal: PS), to officers for exceptionally meritorious service and particular devotion to duty. * iPhrothiya yeBhronzi (post-nominal: PB), to all ranks of the SANDF who have distinguished themselves by performing services of the highest order. =Civilian= The \\"old\\" South African honours were retained for a few years after the Republic was reconstituted as a multi-racial democratic state in 1994. The sports awards were, however, replaced immediately. A new series of national orders was introduced in 2002, as part of the process of creating new national symbols. The current civil honours are: * Sports awards  Presidential Sports Award (1994– ) * Provincial orders  Western Cape Golden Cross  Order of the Disa Order of the Baobab The Order of the Baobab (SCOB/GCOB/COB) was instituted in 2002 to award South African citizens for services to democracy, human rights, arts and sciences and community service.

As an MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, he introduced the bill which made Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday in Ireland in 1903. He was one of the few politicians to have served both as member in the House of Commons and in Dáil Éireann. Early life O'Mara was born in Limerick, son of Stephen O'Mara and Elen Pigott and educated by the Christian Brothers in Limerick, and at Clongowes Wood College in Dublin. His studies at the Royal University of Ireland were postponed after the death of his Uncle Jim in 1893, when James was sent to London to take over his Uncle's business functions. After his marriage in 1895 to Agnes Cashel, sister of the republican activist in later life Alice Cashel, he moved to Epsom in Surrey, and then to Sydenham in London. He finally got his B.A. degree from the Royal University in 1898. Political career In the 1900 general election, O'Mara was elected unopposed as Irish Parliamentary Party MP for South Kilkenny. His career in Westminster is noted for his introduction of the Bill which became the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, making Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday. O'Mara later introduced the law which required that pubs be closed on 17 March, a provision which was repealed only in the 1970s. In 1907, O'Mara resigned from Parliament and from the Irish Parliamentary Party to join Sinn Féin, the first MP to do so. He returned to Dublin in 1914 to continue his work in the bacon business, and remained active in Sinn Féin. Dáil Éireann At the 1918 general election, he was Sinn Féin's Director of Finance and the party's fourth Director of Elections (his three predecessors having been imprisoned). He was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for his old constituency of Kilkenny South, defeating the Irish Party's Matthew Keating by 8,685 votes to 1,855. South Kilkenny was one of 73 constituencies returning Sinn Féin MPs pledged not to take their seats at Westminster. In the First Dáil Éireann he became Trustee of Dáil Éireann funds, and travelled to the United States with Éamon de Valera to pursue a fund-raising drive. He resigned his trusteeship and his Dáil seat in 1921 after a disagreement with de Valera. A supporter of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, he was appointed as the first Irish Ambassador to the United States, but served only briefly. After the death in 1923 of Philip Cosgrave, the Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Dublin South and brother of W. T. Cosgrave, O'Mara stood as the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate in the resulting by-election. Polling took place on 12 March 1924, and O'Mara was returned to the 4th Dáil, which sat until 1927. He did not contest the June 1927 general election, and retired from politics. He died on 21 November 1948 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. His wife Agnes died on 2 June 1958.

Wartime service O'Meara's first operational posting was to No. 64 Squadron based at RAF Hornchurch, with which he obtained his first 'kill' while over Dunkirk on 31 May 1940 when he brought down a Bf 109. He had already damaged a Ju 88 off Calais on 21 May. His next claim was a Bf 109 of JG 51, shot down in flames over the English Channel on 19 July and ten days later, while intercepting a raid over Dover, claimed two Ju 87s. On 11 August he claimed 2 Bf 109 'probables' and on the following day destroyed one more. He claimed a Bf 109 down on 13 August, and on the 15th he damaged three Heinkel He 111 bombers. On 18 August O'Meara claimed shared destruction of a Ju 88 and a He 111 destroyed. O'Meara was shortly afterwards posted to No. 72 Squadron at Biggin Hill. He was promoted flying officer on 3 September 1940,https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34970/page/6021 before damaging a Do 17 on 27 September. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 24 September 1940. His citation in the London Gazette read: He was then transferred for a 'rest period' at No. 421 (Reconnaissance) Flight RAF at Hawkinge, working up new pilots who would eventually form the nucleus of No.91 Squadron RAF. O'Meara shot down an He 59 of Seenotgruppe 3 on 26 November, a Bf 109 fighter-bomber of LG 2 that was attacking a Royal Navy minesweeper on 5 December, and then damaged another one immediately afterwards. While with No. 91, he was shot down by a Bf 109 and crash-landed near Folkstone on 17 February 1941. He was awarded a Bar to the DFC on 18 March 1941. The citation published in the London Gazette reported that: By late April 1941 he had destroyed another Seenotgruppe 3 He 59. On 3 September he was promoted to flight lieutenant and temporarily returned to No. 64 Squadron RAF as a flight commander, bringing his score to at least 12 confirmed victories. He was rested from operations in October 1941, joining 1491 Target Towing Flight at Tain. In July 1942, after a brief spell with No. 164 Squadron, he was posted to Nigeria with 1432 Flight until August. After returning to the UK O'Meara was appointed RAF liaison officer to the Army Chief of Staff. In January 1943 O'Meara joined No. 234 Squadron until March. In April 1943 he was given command of No. 131 Squadron at Castletown until May 1944. He flew 170 sorties, and claimed a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 damaged in August 1943. O'Meara was then posted to No. 10 Group HQ, and in October 1944 was recommended for a second Bar to his DFC. Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh- Mallory approved a Distinguished Service Order on 27 October 1944 instead, as O'Meara's length of uninterrupted active service warranting higher recognition. His citation, published in the London Gazette stated that: O'Meara's wartime score totalled 11 and 2 shared destroyed, 1 unconfirmed destroyed, 4 probables, 11 and 1 shared damaged. After several civilian jobs he re-joined the RAF as a flight lieutenant on 3 January 1950.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/38838/supplement/767 He was granted a permanent commission as squadron leader on 1 October 1953,https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/40072/supplement/297 where he remained until retirement on 31 July 1959 with the rank of squadron leader.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/41792/supplement/5158 Post- war years After his retirement from the RAF, O'Meara worked as an architect for Wimpey Homes before running several business enterprises. His daughter was hit and killed by a car in 1969 and his relationship with his wife deteriorated and they divorced. He then ran a restaurant before buying a hotel in Port Gaverne, Cornwall. O'Meara died in 1974 in the Barnstaple Hospital in North Devon after suffering for several years with a liver infection picked up from a parasite while stationed in India.

The game was a launch title for the PS2 in North America. IGN gave some praise to the game for its innovations at the time, including its full use of the DualShock 2 controller's buttons and the unique \\"paper doll\\" system in which the player's avatar actually visibly wears the armor and clothing assigned to it. But the IGN review said most aspects of the game were fairly \\"run-of-the-mill\\" without being egregiously bad. GameSpot criticized the game for its dated visuals and laggy gameplay during battles. The GameSpot review said that the interesting features do not overshadow the fact that the \\"core gameplay is awkward and uninteresting\\". Gameplay Evergrace features two main characters, Darius the swordsman and Sharline the homemaker, with two distinctly different storylines and different battle techniques. The game allows players to switch between characters at any save point, and uses an experience system dependent on items and equipment rather than statistical upgrades. Another feature is the Palmira Action System which allows players to improve the physical abilities of their characters by combining specialized crystals with their armaments. Evergrace also features a bonus dungeon that is named after Shadow Tower, another game by FromSoftware, a company often known for including past game references in their games. The Moonlight Sword, for example, a weapon that originated in their flagship series, King's Field, also appears in Evergrace as well as its follow-up, Forever Kingdom. Plot The continent of Edinbury once held the largest and most powerful empire of all time: the Rieubane Empire. This empire was primarily ruled by Morpheus, a powerful magician, and his servants and clients. Morpheus became devoted to studying the Crest, a series of markings on one's hand, and are considered cursed due to the misfortunes that happen to the Crestbearers. Morpheus was fascinated with the Crest and performed several experiments, thus creating the powerful Palmira Armaments and the man-made AI Crest. After capturing a renegade soldier who had the Crest, Morpheus ordered the Empire to invade Toledo, a nearby independent village in the Billiana forest, because they worshiped the Crest and were supposedly a threat to the balance of Rieubane. The Empire would never have agreed with Morpheus if they knew his real reason for invading the Toledans: simply to acquire more test subjects. In the end, the Empire effortlessly crushed Toledo, but as the flames grew higher, the Rieubane Empire, Toledo and the Human Research Lab suddenly and completely disappeared. People came to call Rieubane \\"the Lost Kingdom\\", and the land became overgrown with Billiana Trees. Hundreds of years later, four villages once part of the empire banded together to establish the empire of Fontraile, but this was not to last... Development From Software intended Evergrace to be released onto the PlayStation 2 in its earliest stages of development. However, even after this had begun, the development team decided to try developing a version for the original PlayStation. The project proved to be too ambitious, and it was quickly cancelled. The musical score for Evergrace was composed by Kota Hoshino. He stated in an interview that voices are used as the primary \\"instrument\\" in the game's soundtrack. Hoshino recorded samples of his own voice and edited them with Soundforge, then recorded more voice samples to create what he considers to be an ethnic sound. Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen were also added. All the score's percussion was synthesized. Reception According to Famitsu, Evergrace debuted on Japanese sales charts at fifth place, selling 75,083 copies. It fell to seventh place the following week, selling an additional 11,886 copies. After continuing to fall on the charts, Evergrace sold 134,865 copies in the region by the end of 2000. Evergrace received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the game for its innovations, including its full use of the DualShock controller buttons and the unique \\"paper doll\\" system in which the player's avatar actually wears the armor and clothing assigned to it. GameSpot criticized the game for its dated visuals and laggy gameplay during battles. Steven Frost of NextGen said, \\"Evergraces 32-bit beginnings really hurt its ability to provide a true next-generation experience. Only die-hard RPG fans will have the patience and persistence to finish this adventure.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two sevens, one eight, and one six for a total of 28 out of 40.

The primary aim of the PMSA is to heighten public awareness of Britain's monumental heritage— past, present, and future—through activities, publications and dialogue. It campaigns for the listing, preservation, protection and restoration of public monuments and sculpture, covering a period from the Stuart monarchy to the present day. As well as campaigning for historic monuments and public sculpture, the PMSA has been active in promoting the commissioning of new public monuments and sculpture. The PMSA's founding members were Jo Darke, with the writer, lecturer and broadcaster Paul Atterbury, Ian Leith of the National Monuments Record, and Catherine Moriarty, then Co-ordinator of the National Inventory of War Memorials, which was founded in 1989 to create a database of war memorials throughout the UK. From the beginning, the PMSA was actively encouraged by the writer and sculpture scholar Benedict Read, and by Andrew and Janet Naylor, metal sculpture conservators. Subscriptions were opened in May 1991 and membership has now stabilised at around 250. Since 1991, the PMSA has initiated the National Recording Project and collaborated with the publishers Liverpool University Press on the acclaimed series Public Sculpture of Britain, and has established the much respected bi-annual Sculpture Journal. It has set up events, conferences and publications in collaboration with English Heritage, the UK Institute of Conservators, University College Dublin and many other similar institutions. The PMSA operates an advisory service and distributes newsletters and newssheets to its members. The latest projects include collaboration with other organisations and individuals to oversee production of the Custodians Handbook, published in 2005 and occasionally updated. It was designed to give guidance to families and individuals who inherit sculptors' works, studios, archives and memorabilia; and the campaign Save our Sculpture (SoS) was set to encourage concerned members of the public to keep watch over their neighbourhood sculptures, and to report damage or negligence to the PMSA. Another project is creating a digital database of public sculptures and monuments. The Association is a charitable company which is run by a board comprising its Director and the Trustees, known as the General Committee. Ad hoc sub-committees are established to organise events, projects or campaigns. The President of the PMSA is the Duke of Gloucester and the chairman is John Lewis, OBE. It is based at 70 Cowcross Street, London.

Ku is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans. The ancestral bacterial Ku is a homodimer (two copies of the same protein bound to each other). Eukaryotic Ku is a heterodimer of two polypeptides, Ku70 (XRCC6) and Ku80 (XRCC5), so named because the molecular weight of the human Ku proteins is around 70 kDa and 80 kDa. The two Ku subunits form a basket-shaped structure that threads onto the DNA end. Once bound, Ku can slide down the DNA strand, allowing more Ku molecules to thread onto the end. In higher eukaryotes, Ku forms a complex with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to form the full DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA-PK. Ku is thought to function as a molecular scaffold to which other proteins involved in NHEJ can bind, orienting the double-strand break for ligation. The Ku70 and Ku80 proteins consist of three structural domains. The N-terminal domain is an alpha/beta domain. This domain only makes a small contribution to the dimer interface. The domain comprises a six-stranded beta sheet of the Rossmann fold. The central domain of Ku70 and Ku80 is a DNA-binding beta- barrel domain. Ku makes only a few contacts with the sugar-phosphate backbone, and none with the DNA bases, but it fits sterically to major and minor groove contours forming a ring that encircles duplex DNA, cradling two full turns of the DNA molecule. By forming a bridge between the broken DNA ends, Ku acts to structurally support and align the DNA ends, to protect them from degradation, and to prevent promiscuous binding to unbroken DNA. Ku effectively aligns the DNA, while still allowing access of polymerases, nucleases and ligases to the broken DNA ends to promote end joining. The C-terminal arm is an alpha helical region which embraces the central beta-barrel domain of the opposite subunit. In some cases a fourth domain is present at the C-terminus, which binds to DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. Both subunits of Ku have been experimentally knocked out in mice. These mice exhibit chromosomal instability, indicating that NHEJ is important for genome maintenance. In many organisms, Ku has additional functions at telomeres in addition to its role in DNA repair. Abundance of Ku80 seems to be related to species longevity. Aging Mutant mice defective in Ku70, or Ku80, or double mutant mice deficient in both Ku70 and Ku80 exhibit early aging. The mean lifespans of the three mutant mouse strains were similar to each other, at about 37 weeks, compared to 108 weeks for the wild-type control. Six specific signs of aging were examined, and the three mutant mice were found to display the same aging signs as the control mice, but at a much earlier age. Cancer incidence was not increased in the mutant mice. These results suggest that Ku function is important for longevity assurance and that the NHEJ pathway of DNA repair (mediated by Ku) has a key role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks that would otherwise cause early aging.Bernstein H, Payne CM, Bernstein C, Garewal H, Dvorak K (2008). \\"Cancer and aging as consequences of un-repaired DNA damage\\". In: New Research on DNA Damages (Editors: Honoka Kimura and Aoi Suzuki) Nova Science Publishers, New York, Chapter 1, pp. 1-47. open access, but read only https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=43247 (Also see DNA damage theory of aging.)  Plants  Ku70 and Ku80 have also been experimentally characterized in plants, where they appear to play a similar role to that in other eukaryotes. In rice, suppression of either protein has been shown to promote homologous recombination (HR) This effect was exploited to improve gene targeting (GT) efficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the study, the frequency of HR-based GT using a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) was increased up to sixteen times in ku70 mutants This result has promising implications for genome editing across eukaryotes as DSB repair mechanisms are highly conserved. A substantial difference is that in plants, Ku is also involved in maintaining an alternate telomere morphology characterized by blunt-ends or short (≤ 3-nt) 3’ overhangs. This function is independent of the role of Ku in DSB repair, as removing the ability of the Ku complex to translocate along DNA has been shown to preserve blunt-ended telomeres while impeding DNA repair. Name The name 'Ku' is derived from the surname of the Japanese patient in which it was discovered.

Second line-up and Onstage Death of Les Harvey McGinnis and Dewar left the band in 1971 and were replaced by Ronnie Leahy and Steve Thompson. Guitarist and co-founder Les Harvey was electrocuted onstage in front of a live audience at Swansea's Top Rank Suite in May 1972. Wires to the group's equipment were reportedly damaged by the audience and although the road crew attempted to repair the damage, they overlooked a loose ground wire. Harvey received a jolt of electricity as he reached for a microphone while his fingers touched the metal strings on his guitar. His body reportedly flew into the air and came to rest with his guitar in contact with the microphone stand. Bandmates who tried to rescue him reportedly got shocked themselves and it wasn't until someone kicked his guitar away that medical personnel were able to render aid. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Jimmy McCulloch would subsequently replace the main songwriter Harvey as lead guitarist, following Harvey's death. After Harvey's death the band reconsidered their direction. After band breakup Stone the Crows ultimately broke up in June 1973, and Peter Grant continued to manage Maggie Bell's career. Guided by Grant, Bell subsequently recorded two solo albums, Queen of the Night (1974) and Suicide Sal (1975) and an album with the Grant-managed band Midnight Flyer (1981).

The M86 Pursuit Deterrent Munition (PDM) is a small United States anti-personnel mine intended to be used by special forces to deter pursuing enemy forces. Description The M86 anti-personnel mine is to be hand emplaced or deployed as a deterrent munition by special forces or selected personnel only on operations where they may be pursued by an enemy. The M86 mine is similar in configuration and possesses functioning characteristics of the ADAM mine presently loaded in the 155mm projectile, M731 (and M692). The mine is wedge shaped, and contains a safety clip, arming strap assembly, internal safing and arming device, seven tripline sensor, a reserve battery, electronic circuitry containing an IC chip, and a kill mechanism surrounded by an overlay containing a liquid propellant, and encapsulated in a molded plastic form. The M86 antipersonnel mine is manually armed by removing the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the at- rest position of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A; electric detonator initiates the S&A; firing train which initiates a detonating cord which then initiates a thin layer of liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern. If the mine is not activated by tripline or disturbance mode, a factory preset self-destruct feature initiates the mine in 4 hours plus 0-20%.

It has appeared in three editions, published in 1953, 1968, and 2009 respectively: the 2009 edition adopts the amended title, A Biographical Dictionary of Sculptors in Britain 1660–1851. The first two editions were researched and written by Rupert Forbes Gunnis, and were often known simply as Gunnis. The third edition was edited by Ingrid Roscoe. The book is a major scholarly work, which rapidly established itself as a standard authority on British sculptors and sculpture. First edition The Dictionary was conceived and written by Rupert Forbes Gunnis (1899–1965), a civil servant in the British colonial Government of Cyprus, and later curator of Tunbridge Wells Museum. He originally hoped to write \\"a complete dictionary of British sculpture from the earliest times until the close of the last [the 19th] century\\", but realised that he needed to confine himself to a more manageable period.Gunnis 1968, pp. 5–6. The finished volume nonetheless contained over 1,700 biographies, with lists of the artists' works. In addition to a considerable amount of archival research, Gunnis personally visited over 6,000 churches in Britain (and others in Ireland), and saw the great majority of the works mentioned in the book. The volume was completed in 1951 (the date of the preface), and published by Odhams Press in 1953. Second edition Gunnis also edited the revised second edition, published by the Abbey Library in 1968. Revisions included the correction of errors, and the addition of some new material. Gunnis admitted, however, that he had been unable to add all the new information that he had accumulated in an additional thirteen years of research, \\"for had I done so the book would have been more than twice its original size\\".Gunnis 1968, p. 9. Third edition Under the auspices of the Henry Moore Institute and the University of Leeds, work began in 2000 on revising the dictionary for a new edition, overseen by Ingrid Roscoe, with the assistance of co-editors Emma Hardy, a curator at the Geffrye Museum, and Greg Sullivan, curator of British Art 1750–1830 at Tate Britain. The Dictionary was published by Yale University Press in 2009 under the slightly amended title, A Biographical Dictionary of Sculptors in Britain 1660–1851. The third edition is considerably enlarged: it contains 3,125 entries and runs to 1,620 pages (as compared to 514 pages for the second edition). It covers sculptors who were active in Britain at any time between 1660 and 1851, irrespective of their country of origin and even if they also worked outside these dates. All the artists listed in the Gunnis Dictionary remain, but new ones have been added, reflecting later research on the subject. The book's format is closely based on the original, each entry consisting of a biographical text followed by a list of works. There is also a comprehensive general bibliography. Unlike Gunnis's editions, which included up to thirty illustrations, the new edition is unillustrated. =Reception= The third edition was widely welcomed and recommended as a key starting point for research into this area of art.E.g. The view of the professional body for art historians in Britain, the Association of Art Historians, was expressed by Rosa Somerville writing in the Association's journal, The Art Book, in 2010 where she stated that the new dictionary \\"is a great advance on the work ... that was begun so enthusiastically and extensively by Rupert Gunnis\\". Somerville added that the new dictionary is \\"a handsome and scholarly reference book detailing British sculptors between the Restoration and the Great Exhibition\\". John Kenworthy-Browne, writing in Apollo magazine, said: \\"This magnificent dictionary of British sculptors supersedes Rupert Gunnis's standard work simply by the sheer volume of information that it presents.\\" Similarly in The Art Newspaper, Oliver Garnett of the National Trust wrote: \\"The result is breathtaking: 1,000 additional biographies, followed by work lists covering 35,000 individual pieces, tied to a bibliography of 3,000 items which will be immensely useful in its own right.\\" Similar praise came from Simon Watney, writing in The Burlington Magazine, who said of the work that went into the new dictionary: \\"The result is a book of unrivalled authority, which employs a pleasurably straightforward format of biographies followed in each case by chronological sequences of religious and then secular works.\\" A more qualified review came from Jean Wilson of the Church Monuments Society who, while allowing that the book \\"improves tremendously on its predecessor, that its coverage is enormously increased, and that it is enlightening\\", uncovered a number of \\"exasperating problems\\" of error and inconsistency in the book's indexes, and suggested that these do not reach the \\"high standards set by the editors\\" elsewhere in the volume. Online edition The contents of the third edition were published online as a fully searchable database in 2012, hosted by the Henry Moore Institute. The contents are regularly updated with the benefits of new research, including new biographical entries, new biographical details and attributed works within existing entries, and an expanded bibliography. Complementary dictionaries The Dictionary is complemented for the preceding century by the \\"Biographical Dictionary of London Tomb Sculptors, c.1560–c.1660\\" by Adam White, published by the Walpole Society in 1999 (and supplemented by a list of corrigenda and addenda published in 2009). Although White's Dictionary may appear from its title to be narrower in scope than Gunnis's, in practice, given that most active sculptors in this period included tomb monuments among their work, and that London overwhelmingly dominated the trade, the two dictionaries in fact cover very similar ground. For Ireland, the Dictionary is complemented by the biographical entries for sculptors active from 1600 to modern times which occupy the greater part of Sculpture, 1600–2000, volume 3 of the five-volume Art and Architecture of Ireland, published by the Royal Irish Academy in 2014.

It was founded in Leeds on 11 November 1912 by Frank Rutter, who was the newly appointed curator of Leeds Art Gallery (then Leeds City Art Gallery) at the time, with the support of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds, Michael Sadler. The LACF was established to encourage the visual arts in Leeds and, most importantly, to provide a source of funding that was independent of the municipality for the purchase of contemporary and historic works of art and design for the people of Leeds. Other founding members and sponsors included Mr Sydney Kitson, a well-known local architect and collector, and Frank Harris Fulford, director of the family firm C. E. Fulford Limited, which manufactured Bile Beans. Today, most of the LAF's work is channelled through the Leeds City Art Galleries. Through subscriptions and fund-raising events the LAF has helped to enrich the visual life of Leeds by making purchases of art works for display in Leeds at the Leeds City Art Gallery, Temple Newsam House and Lotherton Hall. The LAF has, since its inception, purchased art works, often buying art works outright as part of the LAF collection, but also by supporting the purchase of art works through a contribution to the full purchase price. The LACF has also been the recipient of many generous bequests and donations of art works over the years. The art works belonging to the LAF are too numerous to mention in full, but include works by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Walter Sickert, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Patrick Heron, Alexander Calder, Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol, Stanley Spencer, Terry Frost and Thomas Hearne. The LAF has also contributed towards the acquisition of many artworks on display in Leeds Museums and Galleries, including by such well-known names as Thomas Chippendale, J.M.W. Turner, John Sell Cotman, John Atkinson Grimshaw, Stass Paraskos, Paula Rego, Bridget Riley, Grayson Perry and Auguste Rodin. The LAF has also supported various educational and publishing activities associated with the visual arts in Leeds, and continues to do so, not only at the Leeds City Art Galleries, but other visual art centres in Leeds, including the University of Leeds Art Gallery and East Street Arts (Vitrine project). The LAF is an independent registered charity (Registered Charity Number 529300), but it maintains close links with Leeds City Council, and with other organisations with an interest in the artistic life of Leeds, including the University of Leeds, East Street Arts, the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society and local businesses.

It is a distinct business unit from General Electric's railway locomotive manufacturer. GE Rail Services offers leases and manages railcars (freight cars) for the North American market; its product range includes all types of common freight cars including box, flat, covered and open-top hopper (gondola), and tank cars. The company also manages service and repair of freight cars. In 2015 GE Capital announced the sale of its tank car and services business to Marmon Holdings, and the remainder of the business (other freight cars, locos) to First Union Rail. History In 1986 GE Railcar Services Corp. acquired the assets of North American Car Corp, a former rail leasing subsidiary of Tiger International which had become insolvent in 1984; GE acquired ~35000 freight cars and 14 maintenance units in North America at a cost of $420 million.Sources:  * In 1989 GE acquired the railcar leasing and management business of Brae Corporation from holding company Leucadia National for approximately $180 million, acquiring 15000 boxcars. With the acquisition GE entered the per diem boxcar leasing business. In 1992 GE Capital Railcar reached an agreement to lease Itel Rail Corporation's (subsidiary of Itel Corporation) railcar fleet; in 1990 Itel Rail had ~70,000 rail vehicles, approximately one third of which were boxcars, another third covered hopper cars, the remainder tank, open hopper, flat and specialty freight cars. The lease agreement was for 12 years with a purchase option - the agreement brought GE's for lease fleet to ~140,000 units. The agreement moved significant accumulated debt off Itel Corporation's balance sheet; in the late 1989s Itel Corp had expanded aggressively into the North American railcar leasing business through a number of acquisitions, as well as acquiring interests in other related logistics and transportation businesses. GE would pay rental payments of $150 million pa (GE Capital had also acquired Itels container leasing business in 1990 for over $800 million.)Sources:  In 1997 GE Railcar entered into a leasing agreement with manufacturer American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) to lease 35000 freight cars (over three quarters of its fleet), with purchase and supplementary agreements to use ACF's repair facilities.Sources:  * In 2008 GE attempted to sell the business - GATX Corp offered $3billion for the company but the deal was not completed due to difficulties raising funds due to the late 2000s banking credit crisis. In 2011 it was reported that GE had again placed the business up for sale - the assets were valued at $3 billion at the end of 2010. The unconfirmed sale attempt was reported as having been cancelled in July 2011. In the late 2000s, due to a drop in rail car leasing due to the general economic recession initiated by the 2000s financial crisis GE Railcar attempted to alter the terms on a $1.2 billion contract (2007)for the acquisition of over 11000 rail cars from The Greenbrier Companies. The GE contract represented 84% of Greenbrier's ongoing railcar orders, and any reduction in the order volume was expected to cause job and revenue losses in addition to those already caused by the recession and the production slowdown for the GE order. On 15 December 2009 GE and Greenbrier reached a modified contract agreement in which Greenbrier would manufacturer up to 6000 units for GE. As terms of the contract Greenbrier gained the right of first refusal to manufacture any GE railcar order placed up to December 2018, and a similar right to any vehicle refurbishment up to 2015. Greenbrier also obtained maintenance co-partner agreement for GE's rail rolling stock over a 5-year period. The resultant contract gave Greenbrier an order book of at least 4900 units valued at $430 million plus an option for a further 2200 cars. The renegotiated contract represented approximately 40% of the North American freight car industry backlog.Sources:    On 30 September 2015 GE Capital announced the sale its rail services division: Marmon Holdings (Berkshire Hathaway) acquired most of the businesses tank car fleet, and was to acquire the servicing activities in late 2015 - the business was to be managed by Union Tank Car Company and Procor; the remainder of the GE rail fleet, comprising c.77000 freight cars and 1000 locos was to be sold to First Union Rail (Wells Fargo), expected closure in 2016. The total value of the sale to GE was $1.3 billion on a $4.0 billion net investment.

It was an industrial breathing set and not suitable for diving. It was made from 1914 or earlier to the 1960s or later. (Distinguish from \\"Proton\\", which is another sort of Siebe Gorman rebreather). Also known as proto suits. Its breathing bag was worn on the chest. It had one or two oxygen cylinders, across the lumbar part of the back: often one, but this image shows two. Its duration in use was one or two hours, dependent on the size of oxygen cylinder fitted. Its absorbent (tradename Protosorb) was loose in the bottom of the breathing bag, restrained by a perforated cloth partition, and not in a canister. It had two wide breathing tubes running from the breathing bag to either a strapped-in mouthpiece (used with goggles) or an industrial-type fullface mask known as a Vistarama face mask, with a curved window and an inner orinasal mask. The canister seen on the front of the bag was to cool the gas in circuit, as the absorbent gets warm as it absorbs carbon dioxide, and that warming of the gas in circuit is welcome when scuba diving in cold water, but is not welcome in hot industrial situations including in deep mines. It was used by firefighters and by rescuers in coalmines, long before open-circuit industrial breathing sets based on the aqualung became common. It appeared in news images of coalmine rescue squads. In 1908 the apparatus was chosen for use by rescuers from the newly formed Howe Bridge Mines Rescue Station. These gear were used in the London fire brigade from the 1950s till the early to late 1970s as replacing these outdated re-breathers to compressed air units which uses a cylinder strapped to the back of the firefighter and the air fed through a hose to the firefighter's full face mask (this is the current type of breathing apparatus.) Some had a whistle that automatically sounded when its oxygen cylinder pressure became low in use. This feature was introduced following the death, in January 1958, of two London firemen at the fire that occurred at the Smithfield Central Meat Market in central London. The first version was designed by Fleuss and Davis in about 1906-1910. It had equal balance back and front of the wearer, and avoided projections on the back that could catch when crawling through holes. The more vulnerable parts were in front in sight of the wearer. The reducing valve was of the constant feed type.

It features conservative-leaning talk programs, paid health and financial programs, and it is also the Phoenix market's broadcaster for University of Arizona Wildcats football and basketball. KFNX syndicated lineup includes Don Imus, Laura Ingraham, Herman Cain, Michael Savage, Lars Larson, and Alex Jones. They were voted one of the top ten radio stations in Arizona by Ranking Arizona and they have over 50,000 listeners a week. They feature five of the top ten talk shows in the country. They have local news updates every half-hour from the KFNX news department, and recently added top-of-the-hour news updates from TheBlaze Radio Network (founded by conservative talk show host Glenn Beck). KFNX also features traffic reports and local weather forecasts with former KTVK weatherman (and former Arizona Lottery drawing host) Jim Howl.  History  The station was originally proposed by Peter V. Gureckis of Rockville, Maryland, doing business as Cave Creek Broadcasting Company. A construction permit was awarded to Gureckis on June 4, 1991 and the KCCF call letters assigned on July 12, 1991. Gureckis enlisted Phoenix broadcast executive Ray Cox to build and sign on the station, with the target format of adult standards. After six years of delays in securing a transmitter site, KCCF signed on June 27, 1997 with a full-service middle of the road format helmed by veteran DJ Bill Heywood instead of the adult standards/big band format Cox originally wanted. Being a new music station on the AM dial was an uphill battle for KCCF, especially when most music formats had shifted to FM by 1997. They did not show up in the Arbitron ratings. Gureckis sold his stake in KCCF in early 1998 to Broadcast Development, LLC (partially owned by Cox), but that ownership wouldn't last long. On June 8, 1998, Cox sold KCCF for $5.5 million to North American Broadcasting Company, headed by Francis Battaglia, who promptly changed the format to brokered talk as a part-time simulcast of Battaglia's existing station, WALE in Providence, Rhode Island. On August 3, 1998, the station changed to the current call sign, KFNX. In 2004, new general manager Mike Barna reduced the amount of brokered hours and added more local hosts. Barna left the station within a year, and later became owner of classic country station KSWG in Wickenburg. The station shifted back to a format of syndicated and brokered talk. In 2005, after years of operating in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Battaglia sold a majority stake in KFNX to Lyle Campbell, reorganizing North American into Premier Radio Stations, LLC (not related to iHeartMedia-owned Premiere Networks). The format was not changed, and Battaglia still ran the station. Campbell filed for personal Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and in 2017, control of the station was reverted to a trustee. On June 14, 2019, the bankruptcy trustee sold KFNX to Futures and Options, Inc., headed by William Brady of Jupiter, Florida, pending FCC and bankruptcy court approval. Futures and Options closed on its deal on November 5 of the same year. Futures and Options is now the sole owner and operator.

He served as captain in the local militia during the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights. He was taking prisoner by the Americans while on a scouting expedition. When he returned, his father had died and their property damaged; he settled in Toronto Township. He built a sawmill with his brother in 1817. During the Upper Canada Rebellion, he served as colonel in the York militia and became lieutenant colonel in 1846. In 1824, he was elected to the 9th Parliament of Upper Canada for York and Simcoe. He was a conservative member, with close ties to members of the so-called \\"Family Compact\\". After several attempts at reelection, he retired to local politics. In 1844, he became a member of the township council and was reeve in 1851. He died in Toronto Township in 1860.

Iacovou served as Foreign Minister of Cyprus for two consecutive terms from September 1983 to 1988 and from 1988 to 1993 and for a third term from 2003 to June 2006, which makes him Cyprus's longest serving Foreign Minister. Between 2006 and 2007, he served as High Commissioner of Cyprus to the United Kingdom. He is also known for his work on the rehabilitation of Greek Cypriot refugees and on persons of Greek origin living in the former Soviet Union. Between 2008 and 2013, Iacovou was Minister of Presidency. Early life Iacovou was born in the village of Peristeronopigi, in Famagusta District. He graduated from the Famagusta Gymnasium. From 1955 to 1960, Iacovou was a student in the United Kingdom and was active in student politics and Greek Cypriot community affairs. Career From 1960 until 1964, Iacovou worked in the private sector in Cyprus. He worked as a Senior Consultant at the international enterprise Price Waterhouse in London, as Principal Officer for Operational Research and later on as Senior Finance Officer of the board of directors for British Rail. In 1972, he returned to Cyprus from the United Kingdom, and was appointed Director of the Cyprus Productivity Centre, where he introduced new management methods in industry and commerce, pioneering programmes for continuing education of business executives, such as a post-graduate management course that has been running for over thirty years. He also turned his attention to the upgrading of skills of artisans and technicians in many fields. Concurrently, Iacovou was Chairman of the board of directors of the Hotel and Catering Institute of Cyprus (\\"HCI\\"), and under his stewardship, the HCI became internationally known, being acknowledged accordingly on the island. Political career Residence of Cyprus High Commissioner in London, 5 Cheyne Walk Following the Turkish invasion of 1974, he established and directed the \\"Service for the Relief and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons\\" on directions from the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus. He later also established the \\"Service for the Reintegration of Displaced Persons\\". Iacovou's work for refugees has had an important impact on subsequent developments in Cyprus, including what has been dubbed the Cypriot \\"economic miracle\\". In this capacity, Iacovou became a close associate of Archbishop Makarios, the first President of the Republic of Cyprus. He also became one of the most articulate advocates of the rights of displaced persons in Cyprus, who form a core issue of the wider Cyprus problem. His work in the field has been nationally and internationally acknowledged, with his exposure to these people's problems influencing his subsequent career. Iacovou is considered one of the ablest administrators of Cyprus and is often referred to as the technocrat with the big heart. From April 1976 until January 1979, he served as Head of the Africa Department of the UN High Commission for Refugees in Geneva. From January 1979 until January 1983, he was Ambassador of the Cyprus Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, with parallel accreditation to Austria and Switzerland; later on, he served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 22 September 1983, he was appointed Foreign Minister and remained in this post until February 1993. His first appointment to this office came just before the illegal and unilateral declaration of \\"independence\\" by the Turkish Cypriot leadership in 1983. Nevertheless, he successfully pursued the condemnation of this action in the United Nations Security Council through the adoption of SC Resolutions 541 and 550. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he negotiated Cyprus's Customs Union Agreement with the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1987, and in 1990, he submitted the application of Cyprus to join the EEC. In 2003, Iacovou signed the Treaty of Accession of Cyprus to the European Union (\\"EU\\"). Later on, he was appointed by the Greek government as President of the National Foundation for the Reception and Resettlement of Repatriated Greeks. His programme for the integration of several hundred thousand persons of Greek origin returning to Greece from the former Soviet Union was met with great success. Iacovou masterminded operation Golden Fleece, the liberation of fifteen hundred men, women and children of Greek origin from the besieged city of Sukhumi in Abkhazia; he later participated in a similar operation in the city of Groznyy, Chechnya. He also founded several university departments for the teaching of the Greek language in countries of the former Soviet Union. Presidential election Following his return to Cyprus in 1997, he ran for office in the February 1998 presidential election as an independent candidate supported by the political parties AKEL and DIKO. He lost, by a narrow margin, to the incumbent President of the Republic, Glafcos Clerides. On 1 March 2003, he was appointed Foreign Minister in the new government of President Tassos Papadopoulos, serving until June 2006. In October that year, he was appointed as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Awards and affiliations Iacovou has been awarded several honours, distinctions and medals from numerous countries, universities and organisations, amongst which are: *The Grand Cross of Merit, Federal Republic of Germany *The Grand Cross of the Order of Phoenix, Hellenic Republic *The Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria (1983) *The Grand Cross of the Order of Isavel La Catolica, Kingdom of Spain *The Grand Cross of the Order of Honour, Hellenic Republic *The Grand Cross of the Order of Infante D.

Whitehead is predominantly a landscape painter, although he also produces figure compositions. His art is sometimes described as a form of Photorealism, although according to the art critic Michael Paraskos it is more like a Poetic Realism, as Whitehead does not simply reproduce photographs in paint, but creates composite images, drawing on many photographs and historic art images. In particular, Whitehead's art is influenced by the landscape traditions of northern European romantics, such as Caspar David Friedrich, and the realism of the Biedermeier realist painters. He has twice won the Wales Open and has also been a prizewinner in Manchester Academy and Hunting Art Prizes exhibitions. His paintings are held in the permanent collection of the Contemporary Art Society of Wales. He previously taught Fine Art at the University of Hull and is a regular visiting artist at the Cyprus College of Art.

Release  Although never released as a single, it has become one of Joel's most celebrated compositions among fans and critics alike; it appears on most of his compilation albums and is a live favorite. In an interview, Joel cites the second side of The Beatles' album Abbey Road as one of its primary musical influences. Another possible structural influence might be Freddie Mercury and Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. At 7 minutes and 37 seconds, it is the longest of Joel's rock music studio cuts, only surpassed by live recordings and five tracks from Joel's 2001 classical album Fantasies & Delusions. On May 6, 1977, before the song's official release, Joel premiered it in a performance at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University. Joel dedicated that performance to Christiano's, a restaurant in the nearby hamlet of Syosset, which operated until February 2014. Joel admitted, years later, that the shout-out to the local restaurant was similar to shouting out \\"Yankees\\" at a Manhattan concert.  Composition and analysis  The song is effectively a medley of three distinct pieces fused into one. \\"Italian Restaurant\\" begins as a gentle, melodic piano ballad, depicting, in the first person, a scene of two old classmates reuniting in an Italian restaurant. This segues into a triumphant and uptempo jazz-influenced section as the classmates catch up with each other's lives and begin to reminisce. Clarinet, trombone, tuba and saxophone solos then lead into a rock and roll section (which Joel calls \\"The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie\\"). This section tells a story, in the third person, about high school sweethearts who were an \\"it\\" couple, who marry young and quickly divorce. The tempo then slows as the song transitions back to the style of the first section and the two part fondly, with one character remarking \\"I'll meet you anytime you want / At our Italian restaurant.\\" = Introduction (Italian restaurant) (0:00-1:43) = The song starts with a piano introduction in the style of a medium ballad (70 bpm). The first lines \\"A bottle of white, a bottle of red\\" are told in a first person and set up the scene of an Italian restaurant. Joel himself remarked that this is used as a framing story, with friends reminiscing on the good old days. The lines \\"I'll meet you anytime you want / In our Italian restaurant\\" ends this section and transitions to a saxophone solo played by Richie Cannata on a tenor saxophone. It is used as a transition piece between entering the restaurant and the discussion. = Transition and Dixieland jazz (1:44-2:47) = The tempo increases to about 95 bpm with a staccato piano driving forward. The narrator tells the others that \\"Things are okay with me these days / I got a good job, I got a good office\\". This is small talk before they continue and discuss the past. With the lines \\"Do you remember those days hanging out at the village green?\\" the style changes to Dixieland jazz. Joel makes a reference to this style change in the lines \\"You dropped a dime in the box and played a song about New Orleans\\", referring to where the style of music originated. A soprano saxophone melody is played over traditional Dixieland instrumentals such as tuba, clarinet, and trombone. = Piano solo (2:48-3:02) = The piano solo is a fast-paced piece used as a transition between the framing story of the Italian restaurant and their high school days. Joel uses alternating octaves in the bass and plays a descending melody in the right hand. = The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie (3:03-5:59) = The longest section of the song is what Joel himself calls \\"The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie\\", and is a rock and roll piece. In this, the narrator (in third person) discusses two high school romances, Brenda and Eddie, and their journey through love. He says \\"Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies and the king and the queen of the prom\\", and \\"Nobody looked any finer / Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner / We never knew we could want more than that out of life / Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive\\". This shows that they were seemingly the ideal couple and would always get by. The narrator then says that they decided to get married in the summer of 1975, and that \\"Everyone said they were crazy\\". However, he indicates that this spark of romance began to fizzle out once time moved on, saying \\"They started to fight when the money got tight / And they just didn't count on the tears\\". Then the narrator says that they got a divorce. Joel comments on the carefree days of teenage life, and how it drastically changes once people reach adulthood, and that sooner or later everyone will have to learn how to move on. = Outro (6:00-7:37) = The transition to the final section includes a grandiose string section which then diminishes back to piano and the style of the introduction, indicating that the song is now back to the Italian restaurant. The final lyrics solidify that we are back in this time period. The song ends with a saxophone solo similar to the first. Personnel *Billy Joel - lead and backing vocals, piano *Richie Cannata - saxophone, flute, clarinet, tuba *Dominic Cortese - accordion *Steve Burgh - electric lead guitar *Hugh McCracken - acoustic rhythm guitar *Doug Stegmeyer - bass *Liberty DeVitto - drums  Legacy  = Reception = The song has been highly acclaimed in retrospective reviews, with Scott Floman, music critic for Goldmine magazine, describing the song as an \\"epic multi-sectioned masterpiece which starts as a slow smoky ballad, builds up to a jaunty piano rocker with a New Orleans flavor that also shows off Joel's knack for telling stories and creating rhymes, before finally returning to smoky ballad territory again.\\" = Joel's comments = After years of speculation about exactly which restaurant inspired the song, Joel stated in an interview included on 2008's The Stranger 30th Anniversary Edition DVD that the song was written about Fontana di Trevi, a restaurant across from Carnegie Hall, which he frequented during a series of June 1977 concerts. The song's signature line: \\"A bottle of red, a bottle of white, whatever kind of mood you're in tonight\\" was actually spoken to him by a waiter at Fontana di Trevi while Joel ordered.Westwood One interview with Billy Joel He has further stated that the restaurant in the story has more than one real-life counterpart; however, Fontana di Trevi was on his mind while he was writing the song. In an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Joel has named this song as one of his top five favorites of his own compositions. = Movin' Out = The characters of Brenda and Eddie from this song became major characters in the Broadway production Movin' Out. The song tells the tale of the two through their love in high school, their marriage, and finally to their divorce shortly after. Movin' Out tells this story among others, although with a slight lyrical change, as the Brenda-and-Eddie story in Movin' Out takes place in 1965 instead of 1975.

It was built from 1960 until 1962 and formed the basis for Mitsubishi's next model, the Colt 600. It was exported in small numbers. History First shown at the 1959 Tokyo Motor Show, it became available in 1960 at a cost of ¥390,000. It was powered by a rear mounted, air-cooled 493 cc two-cylinder engine with a single downdraught carburettor producing at 5,000 rpm, driving the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. The body was a monocoque, in order to be light and strong enough to reach the goal of seating four and reaching 100 km/h with such a small engine. Chassis code was A10, later A11. =500 Super DeLuxe= Buoyed by its sales success, it was given an enlarged 594 cc engine (NE35A) in August 1961 for improved acceleration and durability. This model was known as the Mitsubishi 500 Super DeLuxe. The succeeding Colt 600 used a great deal of the 500 Super DeLuxe's underpinnings, including the engine and layout. The Mitsubishi 500 was never a Kei car: Kei regulations at the time of introduction mandated an engine no larger than 360 cc, which remained the limit until it was raised to 550 cc January 1, 1976.

The U-shaped safety clip (with green pull- cord attached) and location of the yellow arrow on the pressure plate indicate that this mine has not been armed The M14 mine \\"Toepopper\\" is a small ( diameter) anti-personnel land mine first deployed by the United States circa 1955.http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=147782693 The M14 mechanism uses a belleville spring to flip a firing pin downwards into a stab detonator when pressure is applied. Once deployed, the M14 is very difficult to detect because it is a minimum metal mine, i.e. most of its components are plastic. Because of this, the design was later modified to ease mine clearance via the addition of a steel washer, glued onto the base of the mine.  Deployment  In order to activate the M14, the base plug is removed and discarded and an M46 stab detonator is screwed into the base of the mine. Then the mine is placed into a shallow hole in the ground (flush with the surface) and the pressure plate is carefully rotated from its safety position to the armed position using the special arming spanner supplied in each crate of mines. Finally, the U-shaped metal safety clip is removed from the pressure plate by pulling on the attached cord. At this point, the mine is fully armed. When deployed by the USA, M14s are often laid together with other mines in their inventory i.e. the M16, M15 or M19. In a \\"mixed minefield\\" the anti-tank mines protect anti-personnel mines and vice versa. Similarly, M14s can be laid among other mine-types manufactured by different nations e.g. alongside the PMA-2, VS-50, Valmara 69 or TM-62. An M14 mine, showing a cutaway view. The absence of a U-shaped safety clip and the location of the arrow on the pressure plate clearly shows that this mine has been armed The top of an M14 has a simple arming indicator (an arrow embossed on the pressure plate) which can point to either A(rmed) or S(afe), giving a clear indication of its status. When the arrow points to \\"A\\", the M14 will detonate if stepped on. Disarming the M14 requires the arming steps to be performed in reverse. However, due to the possibility of a booby trap or some other type of anti- handling device being fitted underneath, it is often standard demining practice to destroy land mines in situ, without attempting to remove and disarm them. The M14 has not been in active US service since 1974. However, as of 2010 the United States retains a stockpile of 1.5 million mines held in reserve for emergency use on the Korean peninsula, because they are regarded as reliable and effective weapons. This mine has been widely exported and used by various countries, so uncleared minefields containing M14s do exist. The M14 has been found in Angola, Cambodia, Chad, Chile, El Salvador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, Vietnam and Zambia. Additionally, copies of the M14 design have been manufactured locally by countries such as India and Vietnam. There are indications that as of 2008, an unlicensed copy of the M14 landmine was being manufactured in Burma by Myanmar Defense Products Industries at Ngyaung Chay Dauk, in Bago Division. The mine is extensively used by the local Burmese Army.Free Burma Rangers Report: \\"Pictures of oppression: attacks, displacement and oppression in Karen and Karenni States - Karen State, Burma, 19 January, 2009\\" . Retrieved on March 23, 2009 Just as with the VS-MK2 (33 gram explosive charge), SB-33 (35 gram charge) or PMA-3 (35 gram charge), the 29 grams of high explosive in an M14 mine is quite small because it is specifically designed to disable victims, not kill them. Although the blast wound from an M14 is unlikely to be fatal (assuming that prompt emergency medical care is provided) it usually destroys a significant part of the victim's foot, thereby leading to some form of permanent disability regarding their gait. The fact that the explosive charge in an M14 is slightly cone shaped (like a shaped charge) focuses most of the blast upwards, increasing its destructive effects. In situations where M14 victims are barefoot or wearing sandals (e.g. in Burma), the wounds are more severe.http://www.sensorprod.com/news/white- papers/2000-08_frl/index.php Due to the relative simplicity of the firing mechanism, the M14 mine is not resistant to blast-clearing methods, unlike more modern antipersonnel mine designs such as the TS-50 mine.

Early life Alaïa was born in Tunis, Tunisia, on 26 February 1935.In French : Laurence Benaïm, Azzedine Alaïa, le Prince des lignes, Éditions Grasset & Fasquelle (collection Documents Français), October 2013, Paris, 978-2-246-81055-1, p. 77 \\"Lui [Azzedine Alaïa], dont les intimes ignorent également la date exacte de son années de naissance. Né un 26 février, […]\\" His parents were wheat farmers, but his glamorous twin sister, Hafida, inspired his love for couture. A French friend of his mother, Mrs. Pineau, fed Alaïa's instinctive creativity with copies of Vogue. He lied about his age to get himself into the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, a local school of fine arts in Tunis, where he gained valuable insights into the human form and began studying sculpture. He worked as a dressmaker with his sister to pay for school supplies. Career A grey Azzedine Alaïa dress (front), from 1986 to 1987, acetate After his graduation, Alaïa began working as a dressmaker's assistant. He soon began dressing private clients, and in 1957 he moved to Paris to work in fashion design. In Paris, he started to work at Christian Dior as a tailleur, but had to leave five days later as the Algerian war broke out, soon moved to work for Guy Laroche for two seasons, then for Thierry Mugler until he opened his first atelier in his little rue de Bellechasse apartment in the late 1970s. He took apart old garments designed by Madeleine Vionnet and Cristóbal Balenciaga to study how they were made up, and then, he put them back together. It is in this tiny atelier that for almost 20 years he privately dressed members of the world's jet set, from Marie-Hélène de Rothschild to Louise de Vilmorin (who would become a close friend) to Greta Garbo, who used to come incognito for her fittings. He produced his first ready-to-wear collection in 1980 and moved to larger premises on rue du Parc- Royal in the Marais district. Alaïa was voted Best Designer of the Year and Best Collection of the Year at the Oscars de la Mode by the French Ministry of Culture in 1984 in a memorable event where Jamaican singer Grace Jones carried him in her arms on stage. His career skyrocketed when two of the most powerful fashion editors of the time, Melka Tréanton of Depeche Mode and Nicole Crassat of French Elle, supported him in their editorials. In 1980, while interior designer Andrée Putman was walking down Madison Avenue with one of the first Alaïa leather coats, she was stopped by a Bergdorf Goodman buyer who asked her what she was wearing, which began a turn of events that lead to his designs being sold in New York City and in Beverly Hills. By 1988, he had opened his own boutiques in these two cities and in Paris. His seductive, clinging clothes were a massive success and he was named by the media 'The King of Cling'. Devotees included both fashion-inclined celebrities and fashionistas: Grace Jones (wearing several of his creations in A View to a Kill), Tina Turner, Raquel Welch, Madonna, Janet Jackson, Brigitte Nielsen, Naomi Campbell, Stephanie Seymour, Tatiana Sorokko, Shakira, Franca Sozzani, Isabelle Aubin, Carine Roitfeld, and Carla Sozzani. During the mid-1990s, following the death of his sister, Alaïa virtually vanished from the fashion scene; however, he continued to cater to a private clientele and enjoyed commercial success with his ready-to-wear lines. He presented his collections in his own space, in the heart of the Marais, where he brought his creative workshop, boutique and showroom together under one roof. In 1996 he participated at the Biennale della Moda in Florence, where along with paintings by longtime friend Julian Schnabel, he exhibited an outstanding dress created for the event. Schnabel-designed furniture, as well as his large-scale canvases, still decorate Alaïa's boutique in Paris. He then signed a partnership with the Prada group in 2000. Working with Prada saw him through a second impressive renaissance, and in July 2007, he successfully bought back his house and brand name from the Prada group, though his footwear and leather goods division continues to be developed and produced by the group. In 2007, the Richemont group, which owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, took a stake in his fashion house but he still does not show during the collections. However, Alaïa still refused the marketing-driven logic of luxury conglomerates, continuing to focus on clothes rather than \\"it-bags\\". Alaïa is revered for his independence and passion for discreet luxury. Catherine Lardeur, the former editor-in-chief of French Marie Claire in the 1980s, who also helped to launch Jean-Paul Gaultier's career, stated in an interview to Crowd Magazine that \\"Fashion is dead. Designers nowadays do not create anything, they only make clothes so people and the press would talk about them. The real money for designers lie within perfumes and handbags. It is all about image. Alaïa remains the king. He is smart enough to not only care about having people talk about him. He only holds fashion shows when he has something to show, on his own time frame. Even when Prada owned him he remained free and did what he wanted to do.\\" Death On 18 November 2017, it was announced Alaia had died in Paris. He was 82 years old. British Vogue editor, Edward Enninful, stated that \\"Azzedine Alaïa was a true visionary, and a remarkable man. He will be deeply missed by all of those who knew and loved him, as well as by the women around the world who wore his clothes.\\" He was considered a father figure to Naomi Campbell since she was 16 years old. Recognition Alaïa was honored with a solo exhibition at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands in 1998, which debuted at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2000 and curated by Mark Wilson and Jim Cook. In the United States, his clothes are available at Barneys New York alongside Lanvin, Balenciaga, and Dolce & Gabbana, and his shoes are sold at Bergdorf Goodman. Carine Roitfeld was photographed during February 2007 Fashion Week in one of his coats, with The New York Times declaring that she was the only woman at any of the fall 2007 shows who \\"looked like the future.\\" Victoria Beckham stated that Alaïa is her favourite designer and wore the designer's work, a gift from husband David Beckham, to two Academy Award parties in February 2007. Alaïa was referenced in the mid-'90s teen hit Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone. Silverstone's character, mugged at gunpoint in the film, protests kneeling in a parking lot in a famously clingy dress by the \\"totally important designer\\" by exclaiming, \\"This is an Alaïa!\\" Marion Cotillard wore an Alaïa gown in a photoshoot for the French issue of Elle magazine in May 2005. In June 2009, she wore an Alaïa black dress for a photoshoot for the French magazine Madame Figaro. In March 2010, she wore a black Alaïa dress in a photoshoot for Jalouse magazine. On 27 November 2012, she wore an Alaïa black and white pleated dress while attending a luncheon for her film Rust and Bone at Brasserie Ruhlmann in New York City. Cotillard also attended a screen talk at the BFI Southbank wearing the same dress. Michelle Obama is a regular Alaïa client. The First Lady wore a formal black knit sleeveless dress with a ruffled skirt designed by Alaïa to the NATO dinner with heads of state in Strasbourg, France, on 3 April 2009. Also in 2009, Michelle Obama wore an Alaïa dress to the American Ballet Theatre's opening-night Spring Gala in New York. Her choice of fashion by the Tunisian couturier broke with the tradition of American First Ladies who had worn only the clothes of American designers to such events. The former First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, also wore an Alaïa jacket during the state visit to Spain in 2009. Madonna also honored him in her 1993 \\"Bad Girl\\" video. She rips the plastic off her dry cleaned suit, the tag of which reads \\"Alaïa.\\" Azzedine Alaïa was named Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur by the French government in 2008. Lady Gaga has also worn several of his creations, notably in her Thanksgiving special, when she wore a long fall 2011 dress. Rihanna has worn his creations as well, notably at the 2013 Grammys. His creations have also been worn by Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, Victoria Beckham, Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, Solange Knowles, Behati Prinsloo and more. During an interview with The Ground Social & Magazine (formerly known as Virgine), Alaïa slammed both Anna Wintour and Karl Lagerfeld. Alaïa, then 71 and based in Paris, said of Chanel creative director Lagerfeld, \\"I don't like his fashion, his spirit, his attitude. It's too much caricature. Karl Lagerfeld never touched a pair of scissors in his life.\\" Alaïa also lashed out at the Vogue editor-in-chief: \\"She runs the business very well, but not the fashion part. When I see how she is dressed, I don't believe in her tastes one second... Anyway, who will remember Anna Wintour in the history of fashion? No one.\\" In 2018, Alaia was mentioned by Mariah Carey in her song \\"A No No\\" from the album Caution: \\"Got a pink gown custom by Alaia\\". On 10 May 2018, a dedicated retrospective exhibition in celebration of Alaïa took place at the Design Museum in London. The movie director Julian Schnabel dedicated his movie At Eternity's Gate to Azzedine Alaïa.

He was portrayed by Paul Usher and was in the series from episode one in 1982 until 1995 with sporadic guest appearances in 1997, 1998 and the final episode in 2003. Because of the rawness of Brookside, Grant would take things a step further than his counterparts in other UK soaps, once shoving a gun up the behind of Calum Finnegan as he attempted to rape his girlfriend (Lindsey Corkhill). Finnegan was eventually locked in a container and ended up in Kenya and subsequently had to have a kidney transplant. Barry Grant was the only character to have appeared in the first episode in November 1982 and appeared in the final episode in November 2003.  Background  Bobby and Sheila Grant initially raised their three children Barry, Karen and Damon on a run-down Liverpool council estate. Barry, the eldest, was always the black sheep of the family. Barry was expelled from school at age 15 for attacking a group of bullies who constantly picked on and bullied his best friend Terry Sullivan. Bobby Grant grafted for years in an effort to move away from the rough council estate flats. In 1982, Bobby and Shelia's dream came true and they were able to buy their first home and the family moved into Brookside Close. Barry was 23 years old by then. In 1988 it is revealed that Barry Grant's real father is in fact Matty Nolan, a family friend of the Grants. Barry Grant was considerably older than his siblings. At the start of the series he was 23, compared to 15-year-old Karen and 14-year-old Damon.  1982–1989  =Petty Scally= Barry started out as a young 'scally' who, together with an often reluctant best friend Terry, was always looking for easy ways to make money. Such scams consisted of torching his Jaguar in order to claim off the insurance, stealing copper from building sites, and buying and selling stolen items. Barry was always the apple of his mother Sheila's eye but had a less sturdy relationship with his father Bobby who was eventually revealed to be his stepfather. Although Barry was usually on the wrong side of the law, he was shown to be the more respectable of the Grant brothers in early episodes. In contrast to Damon's hot-headed recklessness, Barry was calm and responsible and made amends with the Collins after Damon vandalised their house. Barry was hard-working and smart in contrast to Damon. After Barry was stabbed in December 1982 the doctor told him to stay off work, however shortly after Bobby was out-on-strike and the Grants struggled to pay their mortgage. Despite doctors advice Barry went back to work so that his father would not have to suffer the indignity of crossing his own picket line. =Relationship with Petra Taylor= In the early episodes Barry strikes up a friendship with the recently widowed Petra Taylor. The two run away for a holiday in the Isle of Man together where Petra miscarries. Barry becomes irritated by Petra's depression after the loss of her husband and unborn baby and steals charity money from Sheila before heading to London. Petra later commits suicide and Marie Jackson blames Barry for her suicide. =Trouble with Tommy= After losing his building job after being caught stealing materials Barry and Terry becomes involved with shady gangster character Tommy McArdle. In his early appearances, McArdle drops by the close unannounced to get Barry and Terry to do a job for him requesting, for instance, they valet his car to rid the back seat of what McArdle described as 'pig's blood'. In a stronger storyline, (and one of Brooksides first sensational ones) under instructions from Tommy McArdle the two provide an alibi for the perpetrators of an armed robbery. Local fireman and neighbour George Jackson is convicted for this crime instead, the key evidence being that he (foolishly) drew a map of the warehouse for McArdle, who used him for his knowledge of the place. In another scam, Barry and Terry enter in a counterfeit video deal with McArdle, (which also sees Barry briefly involved with Lucy Collins - daughter of residents Paul and Annabelle). This particular job goes wrong for Barry; despite being careful to not cross McArdle it ends in the beating of Barry and Terry within an inch of their lives in the tool hire shop that they run. Barry typically makes a quick recovery, but Terry is seriously hurt and spends a long time in hospital and for a while afterwards walks with a limp. The McArdle beating one is too much for Barry to try to get revenge on and so sensing he has no friends or future in Liverpool, Barry takes a job as a shop fitter, a job that takes him all around the country. =Return home= Barry returns following the rape of his mother. This event finally splits up his parents, and with No.5 on the verge of being repossessed by the bank, Barry moved back in with his mother to try to keep up with the mortgage payments. =Descent into crime= Barry got involved with a gangster called Sizzler. Sizzler, a southerner living on The Wirral (and depicted as having a chronic stuttering voice; particularly when words started with a 's') 'owned' Barry, after he found out that not only had he slept with his wife, but had soiled his favourite bathrobe in the process. So after agreeing to work off his debt to Sizzler, Barry would do various odd jobs for him, such as when Sizzler wanted to buy a chain of amusement arcades, but the current lady owner refused to sell. Sizzler wanted Barry to kidnap her dog, cut off its head and send it to her in an effort to get her to change her mind. (The episode which ended with Barry on the verge of beheading the dog prompted over 200 complaints to Channel 4). However it was revealed in the following episode that Barry couldn't go through with it. Barry envied the lifestyles of Tommy McArdle and Sizzler and realised that crime, does indeed, pay. =Repossession and departure= Sheila and Barry were eventually evicted from the family home, and the house was repossessed by the bank. Sheila moved in with Billy Corkhill (and later they started a relationship together) while Barry lived rough in a Volkswagen camper van for a while. While he is homeless he and Sinbad sell toy seals as presents for Christmas 1988. They later however find them to be poisonous and spend Christmas Day trying to steal them back from children to whom they have been sold. At the end of 1989 Barry left the area once again for some work in Newcastle upon Tyne.  1990–1995  =Return= Barry returned in August 1990 for the wedding of Terry and Sue. Terry and Sue allowed Barry to lodge in their house during this time. Whilst Barry had been away he had been running a series of illegal warehouse raves. This turned out to be a real money-spinner and he planned to do the same thing in Liverpool. Following a couple of successful warehouse raves in the city (and calling the police halfway through the night to generate publicity for the next one) Barry planned the biggest rave yet, which required financial backing which came in the form of two cockney brothers. Together they organised a big rave night which didn't go according to plan when Barry discovered one of the brothers dealing drugs to kids in the toilets. Barry, never a fan of drugs, decided this meant the brothers should forfeit their share of the profits and made a quick escape with the bag full of notes. The brothers were soon on Barry's trail, and after seeing Barry with Sue and her little boy Danny, they assumed it was Barry's son and so kidnapped him demanding the money back for his safe return. Barry successfully negotiated his release, but the brothers exacted further revenge by locking Barry in an industrial freezer on Christmas Day 1990. Barry made an ‘igloo’ out of frozen turkey boxes and was pulled out semi-conscious by Terry. After a few days in hospital Barry discharged himself, drove to London and planted a shotgun in one of the brothers cars before tipping off the police. Barry returned to Liverpool in high sprits to see in the new year. =Defence of the Corkhills= Amidst all this Barry still found time to sort out Joey Goddon. Goddon had just been released from prison for the murder of Jimmy and Billy Corkhill's brother, Frankie. Goddon was hell-bent on giving the Corkhill family grief, threatening them, and dishing out general abuse. As the weeks and months went on, the war between the two families was escalating out of control but Goddon's big mistake was to threaten Barry's mother, Sheila. Barry drove to Goddon's house, smashed through his back door and shoved a shotgun in his face, threatening to blow his brains out if he ever went anywhere near the Corkhill family again. =Brookside Parade= During 1991 Barry made friends with a millionaire property developer, and Barry ended up 'acquiring' a new development being built near the Close. The development would consist of 4 shop units and 4 flats above. This was Barry's big chance to 'go legit'. =Murder of Sue Sullivan= Barry was unable to sustain a long-term relationship with women. He could gets girls into bed, but when they found out his true character they soon left him. Barry was jealous of the relationship Terry had with Sue. Barry was adamant that Terry could do better than Sue, and so he sets out to destroy her. After months of being deeply unpleasant to her, Barry turns on the charm and sleeps with her. Sue was wracked with guilt and threatened to tell Terry the truth. So, in October 1991, Barry pushed Sue and her young child Danny from the scaffolding on Brookside parade resulting in both their deaths. Barry has always maintained this event was an accident and he was only trying to put the ‘frighteners’ on her to stop her telling Terry their secret. Letting Graeme take the blame Nevertheless, Barry made sure the finger of guilt was firmly pointed towards lawyer Graeme Curtis, a colleague of Sue's who had an unhealthy infatuation with her and had been stalking her. Graeme was charged and found guilty of the double murder and while in prison either took his own life or was himself murdered for being a child killer. Barry later confessed his crime to a priest. =Guilt and remorse= Meanwhile, Barry rented out his shops and flats. One of the flats was rented to a mysterious Asian businessman who paid well above the market rate for the flat in return for Barry not asking any questions and not keeping records about the tenants. With secure metal doors in place and comings and goings throughout the night, curiosity soon got the better of him and Barry broke in to discover the printing of counterfeit bank notes. By February 1992 Barry was getting tired of Fran, especially when she began to turn the screw and realised it was Barry who murdered Sue and Danny and not Graham. A desperate Barry took Fran hostage at gunpoint. Knowing he was going on the run, Barry broke into the upstairs flat and helped himself to £25,000 of counterfeit money. Barry was wracked with guilt over what he had done to Sue and Danny, and let Fran go. He took Terry to a deserted beach (suggested as being Wallasey beach) and revealed that he had slept with Sue and murdered her and Danny. Barry gave Terry a loaded shotgun with the command \\"Do your own justice\\". This episode was notable in Brookie history for only containing Barry and Terry in it, at the beach location, with a cliffhanger ending that revealed in the next episode that Terry couldn't bring himself to kill Barry. He decided that he wanted him alive so he would have to live every day knowing what he did and so Barry fled to Spain. =Return to the Close= In December 1992, a young lady named Jo Halsaw was opening a nightclub on the parade with Barry Grant as her business partner. Jo gave Terry a package, which contained two flight tickets to Spain and a large amount in pesetas. Terry took Sinbad along for the ride. When they arrived in Spain he met up with Barry, who wanted to know if it was safe for him to return home as he was opening a night club with Jo Halsaw. =Arson= After getting the nod from Terry, Barry returned to Liverpool a few days later. The first thing Barry did upon returning was to torch Jimmy Corkhill's shop, Kowboy Kutz. Jimmy had been squatting in one of Barry's shop units and could not come up with the back-rent. Jimmy refused to vacate the premises, knowing he had time on his hands for the matter to be resolved in the courts. However Barry decided to smoke him out and destroy his stock. Barry set fire to his stock and immediately called the fire brigade. However, unbeknown to Barry, the power had been cut off in the shop and Jimmy was heating the place via portable gas heaters, which exploded and destroyed the entire front of the shop, much to Barry's horror. With Jimmy out of business, Barry felt slightly guilty that he had destroyed his livelihood so sent him on a course and gave him a job on the doors of the new nightclub, La Luz. This job turned out to be a change in the fortunes (and character role) of Jimmy, who became embroiled in various dodgy plots from this point onwards. =Discovery of his son= Terry asked Barry for £500, and while Barry was trying to question him on what it was for Terry just demanded the money. Barry followed him to a house, and was just about to drive off when he discovered Fran emerge carrying Barry's offspring. Barry demanded access to his son, but Fran wanted to make sure that the boy was never to find out whom his dad was. Terry gave Fran the entire proceeds of Sue's life insurance policy allowing her to move far away. Barry has never been able to track down his son, which was the ultimate revenge from Terry. The son was played by Stephen Powell. =La Luz= Meanwhile, Jo Halsaw allowed the La Luz nightclub to become notorious for all the wrong reasons, allowing drug dealing and prostitution to operate within the club and therefore the partnership between Barry and Jo never ran smoothly. Wanting Barry out of the partnership, Jo got her hired heavies to force Barry to sign the club completely over to her. Barry planned to torch the club for the insurance payout but was attacked by Jimmy Corkhill when he revealed to him that he had done it before to his shop. Jo wanted Barry out of her way for good and so invited him to the club to talk about the future. Meanwhile, Jo's hired heavy, wearing Barry's coat and stealing his car, runs down Jimmy Corkhill. Barry is arrested for attempted murder of Jimmy. Just when it looks like it's all over for Barry, the charges are dropped and he cautiously returns to the club, only to find his friend from Spain, Oscar Dean sitting behind the desk. Oscar has ousted Jo and bought the club himself. He immediately offers Barry a 60-40 partnership and hands the day-to-day management over to him. =Sham marriage= Terry finds happiness again with a young Polish woman named Anna Wolska. Anna was an illegal immigrant and worked as a prostitute out of La Luz when Jo had control of the club. Anna was desperate to stay in the UK and was willing to pay a man to marry her. Anna and Terry became very close and Terry offered to marry her to ensure she could remain in the UK, however Anna didn't want to ruin her good friendship with Terry and so declined. Barry got wind of this arrangement and offered his own deal to Anna – he would marry her if she would have his baby. (Barry was very desperate for a child of his own). Although she agreed to the deal initially, it wasn't long before she regretted it and had genuinely fallen in love with Terry. Terry and Anna plan a secret wedding and a new life away from Liverpool and she double-crosses Barry by pretending the deal is still on but is secretly taking the pill. Barry is not a man to cross and when he discovers that Anna has been deceiving him, he hits her across the face and reports her to immigration. She was arrested and deported just before she and Terry could marry. =Simon Howe and the Cult= Feud over No. 5 This event particularly broke Terry which led to his involvement with a religious cult headed by Simon Howe. The cult were squatting in number 5 Brookside Close (The Grants former residence) which Simon would call his ‘church’ and would hold regular meetings. Terry gets deeper and deeper into the cult as Barry tries to get him to see sense. Simon wanted Terry to buy the house so they could have a permanent place of worship, but before this happens Barry Grant buys the house. Barry soon becomes impatient with Simon as he wants him out of his house, and to make things worse Simon and his followers start preaching about the perils of drinking and partying while handing out leaflets outside Barry's night club. Barry decides to stop Simon once and for all, and with gun in hand, breaks into the house but is over powered, gagged, tied up and held captive in one of the bedrooms. Terry starts preaching to him from the bible, but Barry doesn't want to know. Nobody around the Close thinks anything of Barry's sudden absence, and they just assume that he has gone away on one of his many mysterious trips ‘down south’. The bomb Eventually Simon decides that since they can't have the house then no one can, and he builds a home-made bomb to destroy the house. They release Barry but the bomb detonates before the three can exit the house. Barry and Terry are not seriously injured, but Simon ends up in hospital fighting for his life. Terry keeps his faith and stays by Simon's bedside as his injuries heal. When Simon recovers he moves into a flat with Terry. Barry, not happy that Simon has not been charged with causing the explosion, breaks into the flats and attacks Simon, saying \\"I’ve killed before, and if you don’t disappear you'll be next\\". With this Simon goes into hiding behind the Close using a few cardboard boxes for his home. Suicide pact Later Simon tells Terry that their work is complete and its time to join the other side. They steal Barry's car and drive into the woods, attaching a hose from the exhaust into the car, so that with both doors and windows shut the fumes will kill them both. However Barry arrives just in time to pull Terry from the fume filled car but leaves Simon behind to die. =Breaking Terry out of the psychiatric institution= Terry ends up with a serious mental disorder and is sectioned under the mental health act and taken to a psychiatric hospital. Barry refuses to let his mate waste away in an institution and illegally smuggles him abroard to have him nursed back to health by Oscar Dean's wife in Spain. =Departure= Barry left Brookside close in a hurry in March 1995, when he got word of the whereabouts of Fran and his son. Finding his son was Barry's main personal agenda in life and despite the fact he was currently engaged to be married he didn't plan to stick around. Paul Usher left the show abruptly at this time and so this storyline was a bit out of the blue. All that was made of Barry's departure was a disembodied hand seen hurriedly packing a suitcase and a rear shot of Barry's car speeding off out of the close. For the next few years Barry didn't return to Liverpool, his presence in the show was still mentioned though and he arranged for his shops, flats and nightclub to be managed by Terry, who eventually sold the club to dodgy Asian businessman Dil Parma. Terry then went on to sell rest of the complex to commercial developers. Barry eventually settled in Blaydon, Tyne and Wear off screen.  1997–1998  =Agenda with Callum Finnegan and relationship with Lindsay Corkhill= Barry returned in 1997 and began a relationship with his step-cousin, Jimmy's daughter Lindsay Corkhill, who herself was later to be involved in the same crime circles as Barry (this led to a much bigger role in the show for Lindsay) but to start with, Barry coincidentally met Jimmy Corkhill at the funeral of someone who owed a debt and after reluctantly agreeing to revisit the close for a drink in Bar Brookie, with Jimmy, he encountered Callum Finnegan (Gerard Kelly), who had been menacing Bar Brookie and the Dixons who owned it. Barry also met Lindsay for the first time on that occasion. During this period, November - December 1997, Barry agreed to protect Jacqui Dixon and Bar Brookie from the Finnegans in return for £30,000 cash. This agreement in turn led to a gang war between Barry and Callum Finnegan, culminating in the 'Lost Weekend' episode. Whilst protecting Bar Brookie, He gave Jacqui Dixon an ultimatum to pay by 1 January 1998 or he would torch the place. With little option but to pay Barry for taking care of Callum Finnegan, Jacqui agreed to be a surrogate mother for close resident Suzanna Farnham, (who was unable to conceive and was desperate for another baby). Once the £30,000 had been handed over to Barry and the Finnegans were out of the picture, Barry stuck around until the New Year, when it was revealed he was married and he disappeared to his 'house in the Midlands' - but not until having bedded Lindsay for the last time (on screen). He stepped in to help when Jacqui Dixon, who now owned Bar Brookie was subjected to a Protection racket by the Finnegans - a pair of Glasweigan gangster brothers (who controlled businesses such as Finnegan Security). Barry had supposedly bedded Jacqui while she was still a schoolgirl and so the two had a bit of history. Anyway, under pressure, and facing financial ruin at the hands of the Finnegans, Jacqui asked Barry for help. He initially didn't want anything to do with it but after a while he demanded the cash in return for sorting Callum Finnegan. Initially, Barry took a beating at the hands of the Finnegan's heavies in the Bar Brookie toilets but he got his own back shortly after when he enticed Callum Finnegan into the office with an offer of \\"five grand a week business\\". Once in the office, Barry beat Finnegan and his heavy with a baseball bat and gave Callum (a suggested) ultimatum to leave the Dixons alone. Not at all happy with this, Callum Finnegan planned to get even. Lindsay was then kidnapped by the Finnegans and held for ransom. This led to Barry tracking down the Finnegan hideout (on behalf of the Corkhills) and eventually finding, beating up and locking Callum Finnegan in a shipping container. =Departure= Barry and Lindsay split up when it was revealed that Barry had married in his absence and had two children and so Lindsay then went on to marry the hairdresser Peter Phelan (but sometimes regretted splitting with Barry). In another twist, Peter was subjected to a planned robbery by Barry after having been given a bank loan for £20,000 and foolishly talking about it. This was to teach Peter a lesson as previously Barry had also threatened Peter at gunpoint in Bar Brookie. After being robbed, the distraught Peter complained a lot of times to Jimmy Corkhill, who in turn must have pricked Barry's conscience because in a rare moment for Barry Grant, he realised this occasion was a bit out of order and gave Peter the money back, shoving it through his letterbox. With the Finnegans dealt with, and no other reason to stick around, Barry once again departed the close.  Final appearance in 2003  =Return= Depicted as living off the proceeds of years of crime and living in a large mansion near Newcastle upon Tyne, Barry returned in full for Brookside's final episode in 2003 when it was revealed that he and Lindsay were to marry. At the end of the show's penultimate episode he had his heavies bundle Jimmy Corkhill into a car and drive him to his mansion, where he held a gun to blindfolded Jimmy's head and in a put on Brummy accent asked Jimmy if he could marry his daughter. After the situation had calmed, Jimmy went on to tell Barry about Jack Michaelson. Slightly concerned that a new gangster figure was again threatening the close and the Corkhills in particular, Barry agreed to go back to the close \\"for old time's sake\\". So he returned to Brookside Close with Jimmy and Lindsay where he met Tim O'Leary. He also had a brief dialogue with Michaelson, mocking his small-time criminal existence. Barry then went over to Jimmy's house - (the infamous) No. 10 Brookside Close - and advised 'Tinhead' with a way of dealing with Michaelson, reciting a story called 'The Stranger's Field'. Michaelson was later lynched from his bedroom window by three unspecified Brookside Close residents. =Revenge for Damon= During his brief stay, Barry has a private talk with Jimmy, telling him his brother's murderers have been released after fifteen years. Barry then leaves the close telling Jimmy confidentially he is going to kill them, something he has said he would do ever since Damon was murdered. A DVD named \\"Settling Up\\" in which Barry would hunt down Damon's killers was planned for release in 2003 or 2004, however, despite a trailer on the spin off Brookside DVD \\"Unfinished Business\\", \\"Settling Up\\" was never made. =Departure with Jimmy and Lindsay= Jimmy went to live with Barry and Lindsay in a mansion near Newcastle upon Tyne. Trivia Throughout the series, Barry liked to drive an upmarket car. In the first episode he drives a Jaguar in contrast to Bobby's Austin Princess and by the last episode is seen to drive a BMW. Barry also owned a Volkswagen camper, a Mahindra jeep and a Vauxhall Frontera throughout the years. Paul Usher was a Bluecoat at Pontins prior to taking his role in Brookside. When Paul Usher left the programme in 1995, scripts had to be hastily rewritten. Most of his dialogue was given to Mick Johnson, while a disembodied hand was seen packing a suitcase. Barry was one of only two characters to appear in both the first and the last episodes of Brookside, along with the Milkman (played by John Whitehall).

It is influenced in part by Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish (1978) and also reinterprets the concepts of war machines and the machinic phylum, introduced in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus (1980). Deleuze and Guattari appreciated Foucault's definition of philosophy as a \\"tool box\\" that was to encourage thinking about new ideas. They prepared the field for a re- appropriation of their concepts, for use in another context of the \\"same\\" concept, which they called \\"actualization\\". DeLanda drew on the concepts these authors put forth, to investigate the history of warfare and technology.  A social history of technology and of warfare  DeLanda describes how social and economic formations influence war machines, i.e. the form of armies, in each historical period. He draws on chaos theory to show how the biosphere reaches singularities (or bifurcations) which mark self-organization thresholds where emergent properties are displayed and claims that the \\"mecanosphere\\", constituted by the machinic phylum, possesses similar qualities. He argues for example how a certain level of population growth may induce invasions and others may provoke wars. As a historian, DeLanda is indebted to the Annales School and the study of long-time historical phenomena, as opposed to human-scale phenomena. The next threshold point, or singularity, to be reached, according to DeLanda, is the point where man and machine cease to oppose themselves, becoming a war machine and when that war machine is crossed by the machinic phylum. It may result in erratic war machines that become nomads, because of a lack of political control. DeLanda writes:DeLanda, p. 132 > I defined the machinic phylum as the set of all the singularities at the > onset of processes of self-organization — the critical points in the flow of > matter and energy, points at which these flows spontaneously acquire a new > form or pattern. All these processes, involving elements as different as > molecules, cells or termites, may be represented by a few mathematical > models. Thus, because one and the same singularity may be said to trigger > two very different self-organizing effects, the singularity is said to be > 'mechanism independent'  Centralization and decentralization  According to DeLanda, centralization and decentralization are two trends in the \\"war machine\\": either military commanders try to centralize command and control of each event on the battlefield and get \\"human will out of the decision-making loop\\" or they delegate responsibility to individual soldiers (e.g., platoons or the German mission-type tactics) to avoid \\"friction\\". \\"Friction\\", according to DeLanda, is like \\"noise\\" — too much friction blocks the war machine, which destroys itself. Thus, rather than waiting for friction to accumulate at the head of the control, command and communication center (C3), which is the case in centralized armies, decentralized war machines allow it to disperse at each level of the machine. The 1805 Jacquard loom, used holes punched in pasteboard punched cards to control the weaving of patterns in fabric and is the first example of a \\"migration\\" of human control to machine control and marks the invention of software according to DeLanda. Command and control techniques adapted by the Germans were then introduced in army arsenals by Frederick Taylor and extended to civilian society: \\"the imposition of military production methods into the civilian society was accompanied by the transfer of a whole command and control grid.\\" (p. 153) The system of Numerical control — and then the CNC — which was developed by funds from the US Air Force, \\"withdraws all control from workers in the area of weapons production and centralizes it at the top. But if the NC (and related methods) effectively shortened the chain of command be getting humans out of the decision-making loop, it also weakened the civilian sector of the economy by its adverse effects on workers' productivity,\\" (p. 154) argues Manuel DeLanda. He thus underlines that the US has become a net importer of machine tools for the first time since the 19th century, and points out that while in 1975 all major manufacturers of integrated chips were American, in 1986 only two were not Japanese. In 1982, the Japanese MITI had launched the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS) initiative to create computers supposed to perform much calculation utilizing massive parallelism. According to DeLanda, the Prussian Army was thus Jominian, that it favored centralized command of the battlefield and the conduct of military affairs over diplomacy and politics. He opposes Clausewitz's classic theory exposed in On War (1832) of the primacy of politics over warfare (if strategy is the art of assembling battles, politics is the art of making sense of victories). Although DeLanda did not quote Sun Tzu, his use of Clausewitz recalls the Sun's counsels on the way to avoid wars as being the most effective warfare: one may be sure he won the war when the war didn't happen. DeLanda claims that this Jominian theory influenced Prussian militarism, the RAND Corporation and current Pentagon policies concerning research and development. This centralization always aims at taking out humans from the decision-making loop and is therefore closely linked to the evolution of technology — although a major thesis of DeLanda's book is that evolution of technology is neither good or bad, as technophiles and technophobes hope or fear. It may be used to keep the human will out of the loop or prioritize cooperative behavior and decentralization: the classic example used is the hackers' re-appropriation of the military ARPANET in the early ages of the Internet. Thus, the Schlieffen Plan, formulated by the German general staff after the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian war, is a good example of centralized war planning and of Jominian theory: everything was so rigidly planned that there was almost zero ability to adapt for sudden changes. When World War I started in August 1914, the military told the emperor that they could do nothing but invade France, although the emperor changed his mind, hoping that if he didn't invade France, Great Britain wouldn't enter the war (in virtue of the 1904 Entente cordiale agreement). But the plan was too rigid and didn't allow for modification, thus potentially becoming one of the indirect causes of the war (although it surely wasn't the only one: DeLanda, who begins his book quoting Fernand Braudel, doesn't believe in unicausality or determinism).  Wargaming and game theory  DeLanda also shows how wargaming, invented in the early 19th century by Prussians under the name of Kriegsspiel, has been used since that time for simulation of battles, in particular by the general staff, which may be considered the \\"institutionalized brain\\" of the armed forces — until their substitution by think tanks, the first one being the RAND Corporation, charged with the elaboration of science policy in the frame of the military-industrial complex. Frederick the Great was fascinated with automatons, as Foucault has shown and with miniature wargames. 19th century wargaming models, which benefited from progress in cartography, was dependent on dice at the beginning to represent the effects of chaos. Eventually, these irrational conditions were taken out of the loop, as well as human will: current military wargames oppose computers, not human beings. It was shown during the nuclear arms race that human beings refused in game models to cross the threshold and press the red button, which convinced military programmers to take out human players. DeLanda distinguishes various \\"ages\\" of war machines (although they probably don't succeed each other in a simple way; Foucault and Deleuze likewise cast in doubt such historical linear succession); he also defines various \\"levels\\" of war machines (tactics, strategy and logistics, which necessarily involve politics). Henceforth, describing the passage from the \\"clockwork paradigm\\" to the \\"motor paradigm\\", he quotes Michel Serres's studies to demonstrate how this new paradigm led to the creation of an \\"abstract motor\\" composed of three components: a reservoir (steam in the case of the steam engine), a form of exploitable difference (heat/cold) and a \\"diagram\\" or \\"program\\" for the exploitation of (thermal) differences. Michel Serres thus mentioned Darwin, Marx and Freud as examples in the area of scientific discourse, > reservoirs of population, of capital or of unconscious desires, put to work > by the use of differences of fitness, class or sex, each following a > procedure directing the circulation of naturally selected species, or > commodities and labor, or symptoms and fantasies....Serres (p.141) Thus, Napoleon's armies, born from the 1789 French Revolution, marked a new threshold of the machinic phylum or singularities or bifurcation: emergent properties are displayed in this \\"evolution\\" from the \\"clockwork paradigm\\" to the \\"motor paradigm\\". This evolution is not merely technological; it is not so much the invention of the steam engine — the first type of motor — that determines this \\"evolution\\". The first steam engine was invented through tinkering and can thus not be said to be the consequences of a \\"paradigm shift\\" as Thomas Kuhn would conceive it. There is no necessary pre-eminence of science over technology (nor the reverse). De Landa thus explains that the \\"abstract motor\\" is more important than the \\"concrete motor\\", taking as his example the dazzling victories during the Napoleonic Wars, > Napoleon himself did not incorporate the motor as a technical object into > his war machine (as mentioned, he explicitly rejected the use of > steamboats), but the abstract motor did affect the mode of assemblage of the > Napoleonic armies: \\"motorized\\" armies were the first to make use of a > reservoir of loyal human bodies, to insert these bodies into a flexible > calculus (nonlinear tactics), and to exploit the friend/foe difference to > take warfare from clockwork dynastic duels to massive confrontations between > nations.De Landa (p.141) Napoleon's true innovation was not in the implementation of the motor invention — he rejected the use of steamboats — but his use of the pool of energy formed by patriotism, itself fuelled by the French Revolution. This high morale made conscription possible; it also allowed more local initiative by and decentralization of the army, since French commanders didn't dread, as did their counterparts, endless cases of desertions if they allowed small groups of soldiers to take over specific missions. DeLanda also notes how John von Neumann was hired by the RAND Corporation to improve war exercises, which he did by devising game theory, which helped The Pentagon think about nuclear strategy. In particular, game theory was used to represent the Cold War dualism conflict as an instantiation of the Prisoner's dilemma. Since the zero-sum fallacy wasn't yet thought, this led to systemic bias in favor of conflict against cooperative games, according to de Landa. Thus, the massive retaliation nuclear strategy was chosen, although nuclear disarmament would have been, in a more realistic win-win game, the best solution. The Turing machines were also perfect \\"abstract machines\\" which would be implemented in concrete machines only later.

After Baghdad fell to the British on March 11, 1917, there were still 10,000 Ottoman troops north of the city, led by Khalil Pasha, who could represent a threat to Anglo-Indian forces. Furthermore, another 15,000 Ottomans under Ali Ihsan Bey were being driven out of Persia by the Russians, and were attempting at joining Khalil's forces in northern Iraq. The British commander, Frederick Stanley Maude, decided that, in order to avert these threats, he had to take control of the Samarrah railroad, running north of Baghdad.

Early Years He was born in London, England in 1791, the son of German immigrants William Berczy and Jeanne- Charlotte Allamand, and came to old York County in Upper Canada with his family in 1794. He grew up in York (now Toronto) (1794-1798, 1802-1804), Montreal (1798-1802, 1804-1812) and Quebec City (1804-1812) - wherever his father's development work required the family to relocate. Military Service and Farmer He served in the Corps of Canadian Chasseurs during the War of 1812 and was at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. From 1818 to 1832, he lived on and off on a property near Sandwich (now Windsor), where he grew tobacco. Politics From 1828 to 1834, he represented Kent in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from the 9th to 11th Parliament. Despite representing Kent, Berczy was residing mostly at York during legislative sitting or in Lower Canada after 1832. Move to Lower Canada and Later Years In 1832, he settled on the property at Sainte-Mélanie-d'Ailleboust of his wife, Louise- Amélie Panet (married 1819), who had inherited it from her father, seigneur Pierre-Louis Panet. Berczy was lieutenant-colonel in the Lower Canada with the 8th Military District, Canadian Militia unit based in Berthier, Quebec from 1845 to 1863, reaching the rank of colonel. He died in Sainte- Mélanie-d'Ailleboust, Quebec in 1873, predeceased by his wife in 1863 and brother Charles Albert Berczy in 1858. Berczy and Panet died without having any children.

It grows in wet areas or shallow water, and can be up to about a meter tall. The native range covers much of the eastern United States, as far west as eastern Texas and Kansas, south to Florida, and north to Michigan and New York state, slightly into Ontario. It is an obligate wetland plant, able to grow in inundated, saturated soils. Saururus cernuus is a herbaceous perennial that gets its name from the white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Flowers usually grow to be 6 to 8 inches long. After the flowers reach maturity the white flowers turn brown, giving the plant its namesake, lizard's tail. The leaves are usually heart-shaped, arrow-shaped, or lance-shaped, and are arranged alternately on the stem. When the leaves are crushed they release a citrus or sassafras aroma. As an aquatic plant, S. cernuus is an important food source for many wetland animals, including beavers. In an exclusion study beavers reduced the prevalence of S. cernuus by 45%. Its medicinal properties have been used to treat swelling in the body. Cherokee and Chocktaw native Americans mashed up S. cernuus roots as a poultice, and applied the plant to soothe inflammation of the breasts and back.

There are two campuses located in Bishan and Newton, which are managed by the Ministry of Education of Singapore. Students attend the institution on top of the existing school they are attending. Its primary purpose is to offer foreign language courses to students that will generally be their third language, within an official grading scheme reported back to their schools. However, it also teaches the Malay language as an institute where Malay can be learned as some schools do not have a Malay Department. In exemption cases, students can replace learning their mother tongue with a foreign language offered by the MOELC, as a second language is a requirement for all students in the Singapore education system. Exemption is typically invoked if the student in question is returning from abroad and is not proficient in his or her mother tongue, or is an expatriate whose mother tongue is not one of the three \\"official\\" ethnic language groups of Singapore – namely the Malay language, the Chinese language or the Indian languages. Courses The Bishan MOELC offers the French language, German language and the Japanese language while the Newton MOELC offers the French language, Spanish language and the Japanese language under the Foreign Language Programme. The Malay language is not included in both as it is generally considered a mother tongue. The Malay language courses have both a Malay (Special Programme) and a Higher Malay track for different degrees of advancement in the language. Students of Higher Malay language are able to cede two points off their O-level score (a lower number is considered better in total O-level scoring) as long as some other minimal requirements are fulfilled. The main focus of the MOELC is at the secondary education level. Grading is examination-oriented. The formal goal of the MOELC is to have the students pass their GCE 'O' Levels for their respective languages, as the MOELC does not issue a diploma per se upon students' graduation from their respective courses. Qualifications received thus take in the form of an O-level certificate. For students taking a foreign language as their second language, these second language qualifications are necessary to enter most tertiary institutions in Singapore, due to the requirement for bilingualism. Grades are reported quarterly to the students' respective schools, with the two Continual Assessments (each making up 15% of the year-end grade), the first Semestral Assessment (25%) and the Final Examination (45%) contributing to a student's final grade. In some schools which offer the Integrated Programme, students are even allowed to replace their lowest scoring subject's results with their Third Language's results. However, the subject being replaced cannot be one of the Promotions Criteria subjects (subjects you have to pass in order to proceed to the next level of education, for example, English). And of course, the Third Language score has to be higher than that of the lowest scoring subject One of the campuses of The Ministry of Education Language Centre is located at Bishan Street 14, which was opened in 1998. The other main purpose of the Centre is language enrichment and provision of grades back to the students' respective schools. This is because as the students progress through secondary school and junior college, the workload of their other subjects causes many students to drop their third language course at MOELC. The years that have been taken go on record and these can be used as partial qualifications later on in life. Depending on the language taken, students may also take several other foreign language examinations, such as the French DELF/DALF certification examinations and the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The focus on the additional examinations picks up for Junior College students, who take at least the GCE 'A' Levels at the conclusion of their course. This is primarily for students who eventually intend to receive tertiary education overseas; the language medium of their courses will be their third language (a national or official language of the destination country). Generally, Indian students whose mother tongues are neither Tamil nor among the languages offered by their schools do not apply to the MOELC to take an Indian language. As the MOELC does not offer these, such students will have to find an alternative centre instead (see the list of schools in Singapore). From 2008 onwards, Indonesian and Arabic are being offered as part of the Asian Languages programme, bringing the number of Third Languages offered by MOE from the original five to seven. The aim of the two new Third Languages is to facilitate future Singaporean engagement with Indonesia and to open up bridges into the Middle East, the latter being one of the world's fast-growing regions. From January 2014, Spanish will be offered to Secondary 1 students as a third language, and to first-year Junior College students in 2018. =Exchange Programmes= Every year, there are opportunities for students to participate in immersion programmes to countries where the language is spoken natively, to better learn and appreciate the language. History The Bishan Language Centre opened in 1996. Previously, there was only one Language Centre, at Winstedt Road. Formerly, there were eight decentralised regional institutions that taught extra languages, with the decentralisation akin to that of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The Ministry of Education decided to combine all the faculty and resources into one centralised building for greater efficiency in teaching students. The side effect of such centralisation is that there may be long travel times from some parts of the country on Singaporean public transport, although the travelling time for one trip does not usually exceed more than fifty minutes. The building was recently renovated. Admission and student cohort = Fees = The MOELC does not charge tuition fees, but students have to buy their own materials and textbooks. This cost varies among the languages taken. For instance, the cost of materials for the French course for the first year ranges around S$90–100. After the first year, however, most of the materials are reused, including dictionaries. = Entry Requirements = Entry requirements are mainly academics-based. In general, a student must be in the top 10% of students who passed the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) to be considered for entry into the French, German and Japanese courses, and in the top 30% for entry into the Malay courses. These requirements can be lowered for second language exemption cases. Thus, the bulk of the students are usually from elite secondary schools whose intake cohorts have a high mean PSLE score. However, a significant portion of the population comes from the junior colleges, as well as students from secondary schools whose cohorts' mean PSLE scores are not as high as those of the elite secondary schools. There are no primary school students. Officially, if a student is not a citizen or permanent resident in Singapore, he or she can only take Malay courses, although exceptions are common. = Entry requirements for Japanese and Higher Malay = As a strong grasp of logograms is needed to study the Japanese language (whose writing system includes kanji, or modified Chinese characters), only students who have previously taken the Chinese language as a PSLE subject are allowed to take the Japanese language course, with exceptions. Higher Malay is a continuation of previous Malay knowledge from primary school, so only students who took Malay as a PSLE subject are eligible for Higher Malay. Non-Malay students, or students who did not take Malay as a PSLE subject, can take the Malay Special Programme. = Lesson times = Prior to 2009, classes at the MOELC took place in two sessions, one from 2.30 pm to 4.30 pm, and one from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm. Examinations may take place either in the morning or the afternoon with variable timing. There are several hundred students per session on a particular day, and students attend two days a week, out of a possible five. This puts the total amount of admissions per year at several thousand. With effect from 2009, Secondary One to Four students offering French, German and Japanese need only attend lessons at MOELC once a week. Each lesson lasts 3 hours 15 minutes, with a 15-minute break, in addition to a hypothetical 45 minutes of e-learning. Hence, similar to arrangements prior to 2009, 4 hours of instruction are administered weekly. Students offering Malay (Special Programme), Arabic and Indonesian continued with the arrangements prior to 2009 until 7 February 2011. From 7 February 2011 onwards, these students will have lessons only once a week for 3 hours 15 minutes. JC H1 and H2 students offering French, German and Japanese follow arrangements prior to 2009; they attend lessons twice a week, each lasting 2 hours. The introduction of the hypothetical 45 minutes of weekly e-learning into the curricula of the Secondary One to Four students offering French, German and Japanese has led to the abolition of e-learning weeks, formerly held twice a year, from all other curricula, including those of the unaffected Arabic and Indonesian, as well as the JC H1 and H2 French, German and Japanese courses. The introduction of weekly e-learning has been through the use of an online e-learning portal. However, since June 2013, the use of the portal has been discontinued. Facilities = Bishan Campus = The MOELC (Bishan Campus) is located on Bishan Street 14 between the former ITE Bishan building and the Bishan Stadium. Located north of the Bishan Bus Interchange and the Junction 8 Shopping Centre, it is separated from them by Bishan Street 14 and a large field. Access to the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network occurs through Bishan MRT station. The Centre also has several IT labs, a multilingual library, and an auditorium that can be used for presentations, lectures and screenings of foreign language films. All classrooms have multimedia support. = Newton Campus = The MOELC (Newton Campus) is located on 136 Cairnhill Road. Access to the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network occurs through Newton MRT station. Discipline Students attending classes at MOELC wear their school uniform. PE attire is not permitted. Rules and regulations exist but, in general, MOELC itself does not mete out punishment. Students who commit significant offences, such as vandalism, fighting, smoking or defiance, are referred back to their own schools for disciplinary action.Rules and regulations , Ministry of Education Language Centre.

The clan's origin is said to be one of the original clans of the Yamato people; they truly gained prominence during the Heian period (794-1185), and experienced a resurgence in the 18th century. Abe is also a very common Japanese surname in modern times, though not everyone with this name is necessarily descended from this clan. Origins and history According to the Nihon Shoki, the Abe were descended from Prince Ōhiko, son of Emperor Kōgen.Asakawa, Kan'ichi. (1903). The Early Institutional Life of Japan, p.140. They originated in Iga province (today Mie prefecture); a number of families originally from this region, and bearing the Abe name, also claim descent from a legendary figure named Abi. Abi is said to have opposed Emperor Jimmu, the first legendary emperor of Japan, in his plans to conquer the Yamato plain. The various Abe families thus settled in the far north of Honshū, where they would become quite influential many centuries later in the Heian period. Though the clan name was originally written as 阿倍, it changed to 安倍 around the 8th century. Though this origin is not positive, it is likely. This northern region, which would come to be known as the provinces of Mutsu and Dewa, was conquered by the Japanese sometime in the 9th century, and the native Emishi people there subjugated or displaced. While many provinces at this time were overseen primarily by a governor, Mutsu saw to the rise of independent families called gōzoku who administered local affairs. The Abe were appointed as \\"Superintendent of the Aborigines\\" ostensibly to control the local people who by now were a mix of Japanese immigrants and former Emishi tribesmen on behalf of the central government, but in reality the government in Kyoto simply did not have control over the region, and was recognizing this fact by appointing the Abe. The Abe for their part used their position to take control over the so-called six districts roku-oku-gun located in what is now central Iwate prefecture surrounding the Kitakami river. In time, they began to have disputes with the governor of Mutsu, an office held by a branch of the Fujiwara family, which erupted into violence in 1051. The main reason given for the attack on the Abe was that they stopped paying taxes to Kyoto, and stopped contributing to the local government. The governors of Mutsu and the commander of Dewa fort combined their forces to attack the Abe, but were defeated. Desperate to quell this affront to their authority Kyoto appointed Minamoto Yoriyoshi as Chinjufu-shōgun. The position known as Chinjufu-shōgun, or \\"Commander-in-chief of the Defense of the North\\", was traditionally given by the court as a temporary appointment to a courtier (typically of high rank) who was appointed as a national general to quell uprisings among the Emishi or Ebisu barbarians of northern Honshū. Increasingly, as military power became privatized this position was rotated among a few clans. In what has come to be termed the \\"Earlier Nine Years' War\\" (前九年合戦, Zenkunen kassen), Abe Yoritoki was killed, and his son Abe no Sadato defeated, by Minamoto no Yoriyoshi and his son, Minamoto no Yoshiie. This war broke the power of the Abe family, but in the prolonged fighting that took place the Minamoto would not have prevailed had it not been for the aid of another powerful family, the Kiyowara. The Kiyowara clan of nearby Dewa province, aided the Minamoto in defeating the Abe. =Other Abe families= Though many other major figures throughout history have been called Abe, it is difficult to know which were related to the Abe clan of Iga and Mutsu. Abe no Nakamaro, a major court noble of the 8th century, for example, was from the town of Abe, near Nara, and derived his family name thus. A family by the name of Abe also proved significant during the Edo period, serving successively in the post of Rōjū, or Elders, who advised the Tokugawa shōgun. Again, it is difficult to determine whether or not this line was directly related to the much earlier Abe clan, but it is of an importance itself nevertheless. Abe Tadaaki was the first to serve as Rōjū, holding the post from 1633-71. He was very likely a son or other direct relation to Abe Masatsugu (1569–1647) who served Tokugawa Ieyasu and fought under him at the decisive battle of Sekigahara. Other members of the Abe family would succeed Tadaaki to the post for much of the Edo period (1603–1867), ending with Abe Masahiro, who was chief of the Council of Rōjū at the time of the arrival of Commodore Perry.

The treaty consisted of 19 articles, and its goal was to set the bases for the national organization of the young Argentine state. It also served as precedent to the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1853. The agreement named Justo José de Urquiza as provisional Supreme Director of the Argentine Confederation, established the application of the Pact of 1831, and set the gathering for a General Constitutional Congress in the city of Santa Fe. Background On the was signed after a meeting between the governors of Buenos Aires and Corrientes, and the representatives of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos. The protocol named Justo José de Urquiza in charge of the foreign relationships of the republic as long as the National Congress did not decide who would take the position. Two days after, Urquiza invited the governor of the provinces to a meeting that would take place on May 20 in San Nicolás de los Arroyos, Buenos Aires. Deliberations and signature of the pact On May 29 began the deliberations to determine the bases of the national organization. The Acuerdo de San Nicolás was signed on May 31, and consisted of 19 dispositional articles and an additional one. The representatives of the different provinces that adhered to the Pact were Justo José de Urquiza (Entre Ríos), (Corrientes), Domingo Crespo (Santa Fe), Pascual Segura (Mendoza), Nazario Benavides (San Juan), Pablo Lucero (San Luis), (Santiago del Estero), (Tucumán) and (La Rioja). Catamarca designated Urquiza as its representative. The provinces of Salta, Jujuy and Córdoba signed their adhesion later. Buenos Aires, whose representative was Vicente López y Planes, did not ratify the agreement. Dispositions of the agreement In the first article, of a total of 19 in the agreement, the Federal Pact signed on January 4, 1831 was declared Fundamental Law of the Republic, and had to be followed and put in execution by the Responsible of Foreign Relationships of the Nation. Articles 4 and 5 refer to the General Constituent Congress that was to start on August of the following year, with the previous election of the deputies that would take part in it. The rules established by the Electoral Law would be used to select the deputies of the provincial legislatures. All provinces were declared equal in rights, with two representative deputies for each province. Articles 6 and 7 mention that the Congress would sanction the National Constitution, consent by the majority of the suffrages, putting the national interest above that of the provinces. Article 8 declares that the deputies could not be judged for their opinions, not accused under any motive nor authority until the sanction of the constitution, though the provinces could withdraw their own deputies and replace them if considered opportune. According to Article 11, the Congress would take place in the city of Santa Fe. Article 15 granted executive attributions to Urquiza, and named him Provisional Director of the Argentine Confederation. The additional article invited the provinces that did not sign the agreement to adhere to it through the provisional Director of the Confederation. Buenos Aires' rejection Buenos Aires rejected the project mainly because of the consequences of articles 5, 11, 15, 18 and 19. It refused to the provinces to have the same number of deputies and that the congress had seat in Santa Fe, since it could not control it nor impose an almost majority for its own benefit, and the idea of Urquiza, merely a provincial caudillo, assuming as Supreme Director of the Confederation. It also refused to share the foreign commerce tax collection of the port for the federal government. Consequences of the agreement The most relevant consequences of the agreement were two. First the sanction on May 1 of the Argentine Constitution of 1853, that was placed in force in the Argentine Confederation, and who in 1854 saw Justo José de Urquiza assuming as the first elected president of the Republic, for a period of 6 years. The second was the separation of the Buenos Aires Province from the rest of the Confederation until 1859, after Urquiza military defeated Bartolomé Mitre at the Battle of Cepeda.

He studied with a number of leading American painters, including Hans Hofmann, Willem de Kooning, and Mark Rothko. Biography =Education= In 1948 he began by doing the exercises in Paul Klee's Pedagogical Sketchbook, which at the time was available only in the original Bauhaus edition in German. In the summer of 1949 he went to Provincetown and studied with Hans Hofmann. Since he already knew about abstract expressionist painting (Willem de Kooning had had his first show) he began painting in that tradition, informed with what Hofmann had taught about forming. He met de Kooning that summer and began to show him his work in September of that year on a regular basis, while also attending Brooklyn College where he studied with Ad Reinhardt, Alfred Russell, Mark Rothko, Burgoyne Diller, Jimmy Ernst, Stanley William Hayter and Robert J. Wolff (the chairman of the department). He also began to go to Hayter's Atelier 17, which he used as a shop for printing his engraved and etched plates. About his Brooklyn College years, Laderman said: :\\"The school was a hot bed of abstract painting radicalism. One of the major buzzwords was for us to try to get \\"on the idea level.\\" That meant having a pictorial idea which would generate work. It was clear that my teachers at Brooklyn and also both de Kooning and Hayter did not believe that they had to go through the motions of imitating recent radical art. They were going out on their own and inventing new art. All of them, though, believed that there were pictorial actions which guided art making and were required to validate the work. But those actions could be unheard of ones, or ideas imported from elsewhere and other forms. Russell had us not only drawing in the Natural History museum, but also highly touted the value of drawing parked cars, looking through the windows into the internal spaces, and those as seen in a second car through a first one. Reinhardt made a trip around the world and came back with slides of Islamic architecture, often severely symmetrical, but with Arabic calligraphy incised, which had no symmetry, since it was excerpted from the Koran. He also brought back slides of the interiors of Hindu and Buddhist temples that were so dark it was almost impossible to make out the figures. We understood his paintings, both because we could see their actions, and because he made his ideational sources clear through the images he showed in school and at his lectures. I also was one of the youngest members of the artist's club, which started while I was in college on the top floor of the building above Atelier 17. This was the abstract expressionist hangout, and it was where the members of the movement displayed their ideas and publicly disagreed with one another.\\" After graduating from Brooklyn, he spent a year as a graduate student in art history in the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. There, he studied Asian art and 14th century Italian art. Both traditions influenced his later work. In 1955, after two years in the army, he went to Cornell University for his MFA, with an assistantship in painting. During his time there, he began to try to paint from nature with less distortion and invention. =Teaching= In 1957 he was appointed Instructor in art at SUNY, New Paltz. After two years at New Paltz he was offered a raise in rank, but chose to return to New York where he taught at Pratt Institute until 1967 when he began teaching at Queens College, CUNY. From 1967 through 1996 he was artist in residence and lectured at many schools and museums, including Princeton University, Yale University, Bennington College, Philadelphia College of Art, Pennsylvania Academy, University of Pennsylvania, the Tyler School of Art, Moore College of Art, Boston University, The Boston Museum School, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Amherst College, Stanford University, Kansas City Art Institute, Art School of Surabaya, Art Center Jakarta, USIS centers in Japan in Tokyo, Nagoya, Sapporo and Fukuoka, Royal College of Art, Bangkok, Victorian College of Art, Melbourne; College Ballarat, Indiana University, Bloomington, Louisiana State University, Arizona State, American University, Skowhegan, Chautauqua, the Art Students League of New York, and the Yale-Norfolk School. He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to paint. =Paintings and exhibitions= His first exhibited painting, in 1949, was abstract expressionist, in the vein of de Kooning's work. Starting with a show of engravings and intaglios at the Tanager Gallery in 1960 his work was painted from nature and always representational. Starting in 1962, he exhibited with the Schoelkopf Gallery until the gallery was closed, due to the death of its proprietor. Subsequently, he showed with Peter Tatistcheff. His work, starting in the 1980s was usually of the figure including a number of major paintings with subject matter. The early subject matter paintings were all about crimes, and several were based on the Maigret series of detective novels by the Belgian author Georges Simenon, including the series \\"Murder and its Consequences\\", and his most famous painting \\"The House of Death and Life\\". = Death = Laderman died of heart failure at age 81, on March 10, 2011, in Manhattan.

It was based on captured plans of the World War II era German S-mine and has similar performance. The mine consists of a cast iron body in a thin steel sleeve. A central fuze well on the top of the mine is normally fitted with a pronged M605 pressure/tension (tripwire) fuze. Sufficient pressure on the prongs or tension on an attached tripwire causes the release of a striker. The freed striker is forced into a percussion cap which ignites a short pyrotechnic delay. The purpose of this delay is to allow the victim to move off the top of the mine, to prevent its upward movement from being blocked. Once the delay has burned through, a 4.5-gram black powder charge is ignited, which launches the inner iron body of the mine up into the air (leaving behind the steel outer sleeve). The charge also ignites a second pair of pyrotechnic delays. The mine rises to a height of 0.3 to 1.7 meters before one or both of the pyrotechnic delays detonates the main charge of the mine, which sprays high- velocity steel fragments 360° around the point of detonation. These metal fragments have an expected casualty radius of 27 meters for the M16 and M16A1 mines, and out to 30 meters for the M16A2 mine. The M16 and M16A1 mines are similar; the M16A1 has redesigned detonators and boosters but remains largely the same. The M16A2 is considerably different, having an offset fuse well and only a single pyrotechnic delay element. This change reduces the weight of the mine considerably (2.83 kilograms) while allowing it to carry a slightly larger main charge (601 grams) The mines were sold widely and copies were produced in several countries including Greece, India, South Korea and Turkey. They can be found in the 'wild' in Angola, Burma, Cambodia, Chile, Cyprus, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Korea, Lebanon, Laos, Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Oman, Rwanda, Somalia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Western Sahara, and Zambia. The United States retains stocks of M16A2 mines for use in any resumption of war in Korea. Variants * M16 * M16A1 – Redesigned detonator and delay elements * M16A2 – Single bounding delay element, reducing the weight * KM16A2 – South Korean produced version of the M16A2 Demining When emplaced, most of an M16 mine is buried underground so it can be extremely difficult to spot them visually, particularly in areas of long grass, heavy undergrowth or other debris. The M16 contains large amounts of metal, so is very easy to detect using a mine detector. However, it is important to note that the act of moving the detection head over the ground may strike the prongs and trigger the mine. In any case, other minimum metal mines may have been planted near to an M16 in order to protect it from mine clearance personnel. Additionally, if long tripwires are fitted, the M16 may \\"see\\" the deminers before they have chance to find it. When tracking the path of tripwires fitted to any bounding mine, great care must be taken: it is quite possible that additional antipersonnel blast mines (e.g. the M14) may have been buried beneath its path. An extra complicating factor is that some M16 mines may have been fitted with an anti-handling device e.g. placing an M26 grenade underneath it with an M5 pressure-release boobytrap firing device screwed into it. Deliberately triggering the mines from cover, using some form of grappling hook attached to a long rope may be useful in some situations and provide an initial way into the minefield before further clearance work begins.

The name was derived from its designer Lawrence Wackett. Development The type was designed to meet RAAF Specification 3/38 for an ab initio training aircraft. It was a tandem seat fixed tailwheel-undercarriage monoplane aircraft with a fuselage of steel tube and fabric construction and wings and tail made of wood. Despite the simplicity of the design, construction of the first of two CA-2 prototypes, begun in October 1938, was not completed until September 1939 (this was partly because CAC was still building its factory during this time period). The first prototype flew for the first time on 19 September 1939 fitted with a Gipsy Major series II engine, fitted with a metal DH variable pitch propeller. The aircraft proved to be underpowered with this engine so the second prototype was fitted with a Gipsy Six, removed from a Tugan Gannet, along with its wooden propeller, prior to its first flight in early November the same year (the first prototype was subsequently also re-engined with a Gypsy Six from a Tugan Gannet). Although in-flight performance was improved, the heavier engine negated any benefits to take-off performance obtained from the increased power, so the decision was made to install a 165D Warner Scarab radial engine driving a Hamilton Standard 2B20 two-bladed propeller. The two prototypes were fitted with Scarabs in mid-1940. Several months passed before the RAAF committed to the type, partly because for a time it appeared that the organisation's training needs could be met with other types already being procured. However, RAAF Specification 1/40 for the \\"Supply of [the] CAC Wackett...\\"Tiger Moth, CT-4, Wackett & Winjeel in Australian Service Stewart Wilson. was eventually issued in August 1940 and the Wackett entered production. The first CA-6 Wackett recorded its first flight on 6 February 1941 and entered service in March that year. Supplies of Hamilton Standard 2B20 propellers, which were being manufactured locally by de Havilland Australia, and the Scarab engines, were erratic during the first half of 1941. The propeller supply problem was not fully resolved until October of that year, so many unflyable aircraft accumulated at the CAC factory at Fisherman's Bend. However, during this time the opportunity was taken to incorporate modifications to the thickness of the lower wing skins that in-service use had shown were required. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War production was increased to make way for the Boomerang and the last Wackett was delivered to the Royal Australian Air Force on 22 April 1942. In the 1950s several aircraft were converted by Kingsford Smith Aviation Services Pty. Ltd. as agricultural aircraft, being renamed the KS-2 or KS-3 Cropmaster. The KS-2 had a hopper installed in the front cockpit; the single conversion was not a success so it was re-modified as the KS-3 with the hopper located in the rear cockpit. Four more Wacketts were converted to KS-3s and the type was further developed as the Yeoman Cropmaster. Operational history The Wackett served primarily as wireless trainers with No. 1 Wireless Air Gunnery School (WAGS) at Ballarat, Victoria No. 2 WAGS at Parkes, New South Wales; and No. 3 WAGS at Maryborough, Queensland, but also as an initial dual flying trainer with ; 1 Elementary Flying Training School at Tamworth, New South Wales; 3 Elementary Flying Training School at Essendon, Victoria; ; 11 Elementary Flying Training School at Benalla, Victoria; and No. 5 Operational Training Unit at Tocumwal, New South Wales. It also served at several other Empire Air Training Scheme establishments in Australia. About one-third of the 200 aircraft were written- off during the type's service with the RAAF and after the end of World War II the remaining aircraft were withdrawn from use and sold to civilian individuals and organisations. About thirty aircraft were subsequently re-sold to the Netherlands East Indies Air Force and the survivors of these were transferred to the nascent Indonesian Air Force at independence, although it is thought that they did not see further use.NEI Research Page Several dozen more were placed on the Australian civil register.ADF Serials – RAAF A3 CAC CA-6 Wackett Trainer VH-BEC on display at the alt=VH-BEC on display at the Central Australian Aviation Museum, 2015 On 14 January 1962 James Knight commenced a flight from Ceduna, South Australia to Cook, South Australia (c.220 miles WNW) in Wackett VH-BEC (ex-RAAF A3-139). He was never seen again. Over three years later, on 28 March 1965, VH-BEC was found by chance two hundred miles north of Cook. Knight had remained with the aircraft after it force-landed and inscribed a diary and his Last Will and Testament on the fuselage panels; the last diary entry was made on 20 January 1962. It was subsequently determined that the mount of the magnetic compass was loose and displayed headings that were 30 degrees in error. VH-BEC was recovered in 1977 and is now on display at the Central Australian Aviation Museum at Alice Springs. Several other Wacketts and a KS-3 Cropmaster are in other museums and in private hands in Australia. Variants * CA-2 Wackett Trainer : Prototypes.

In the British Isles, regional names include Colchester native oyster, mud oyster, or edible oyster. In France, Ostrea edulis are known as huîtres plates (flat oysters) except for those that come from the Belon River estuary in Brittany, France, which are known as Belons. The fossil record of this species dates back to the Miocene (age range: 15.97 to 0.012 million years ago). These fossils have been found in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Egypt, Greece, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, France and Germany.Fossilworks Description When mature, O. edulis adults range from across. Shells are oval or pear shaped, white, yellowish or cream in colour, with a rough surface showing pale brown or bluish concentric bands on the right valve. The two valves are quite different in shape and size, as the left one is concave and fixed to the substratum, while the right one is almost flat and fits inside the left. The inner surface is smooth, whitish or bluish-grey. Fossil of Ostrea edulis from Pliocene of Italy Biology Ostrea edulis are gregarious molluscs that start their lives as males. They mature sexually after eight–ten months and may change sex depending on the water temperature. Usually the lifespan can reach about six years, with a maximum of 15 years. Adult oysters feed by filtration. Ostrea edulis; a) labial palpi b) gills c) mantle d) junction of the two folds of the mantle e) large adductor muscle f) the shell Distribution The species naturally ranges along the western and southern coasts of Europe from Norway to Morocco and including most of the British Isles and the Mediterranean coast. Naturally viable populations have appeared in eastern North America from Maine to Rhode Island subsequent to artificial introduction in the 1940s and 1950s. Habitat Ostrea edulis can be found in estuarine and shallow coastal water with hard substrata of mud and rocks. Human use Worldwide O. edulis harvest in tonnes, 1950–2003Ostrea edulis has been harvested throughout Europe as an important food source since prehistory. During Roman occupation of Britain O. edulis oysters were exported in large quantities back to Italy. However, due to their robust nature and ease of cultivation the Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, account for more than 75 percent of Europe's oyster production. European flat oysters are famously grown in Brittany, France. The true Belon oyster is cultivated in the Belon River, France, and has the AOC protected name. In the 1950s, Dutch scientists artificially introduced Belon oyster seed into the waters around Maine in hopes to establish a viable stock. The initial project was abandoned but ten years later natural colonies of flat oysters were found in the wild. Many North American suppliers use the name 'Belon' to species that are found in the wild throughout the United States. thumb Loch Ryan oysters are sourced from Scotland's only commercial European flat oyster bed. Ostrea edulis is now also being maricultured in the states of California, Maine, and Washington in the United States. The species once dominated European oyster production but disease, pollution, and overfishing sharply reduced the harvest. U.S. oyster growers farm O. edulis in small quantities on both coasts. They are prized for their unique tannic seawater flavour, sometimes described as dry and metallic, and are more expensive than other American oysters. The flavour is considered excellent for eating raw on the half shell. The abductor muscle of the European flat in combination with the shape of the shell results in a somewhat weaker seal compared with other oyster species. It is common practice to use rubber bands to prevent oysters from spilling their liquor and dehydrating in storage before consumption.

It was founded in 1986 and is owned by the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. It provides classes from Kindergarten through to Year 12. Campus King's College has one campus, located in Warrnambool. It is set on a large site (14 hectares). History In 1983 members of the Presbyterian church in Warrnambool began discussing the possibility of establishing a school for the large Christian community. After a lot of prayer and planning, the school was registered in August 1984 as 'Warrnambool Presbyterian School Ltd'. The following year the Balmoral Road location was purchased for $93,000. It was, at that stage, just empty paddocks on the outskirts of town. In 1986, King's College opened, using a small room they had rented in town. There were 19 students. The following year they moved to the Balmoral Road site, where some portable classrooms were set up and the first building (a toilet block) constructed. There were 26 students that year. 1990 saw the appointment of King's College's first principal, Peter Bosker. There were 106 students enrolled that year. Bosker served as principal for 3 years and Neil Benfell took over. Benfell was not new to the school, however, as the founding of the school is largely attributed to him. In 1997, King's College began to offer preschool classes, and in 1998 they began to branch into secondary schooling. This involved an initial class of year 7s in 1998, who became the first of each year level as they progressed through. This meant that the first year 12's graduated from King's College in December 2003. Ian McKay took over as principal from 2011 to 2016, when Neil Benfell retired after serving the college for almost two decades. Governance Warrnambool Presbyterian School Ltd. is the not-for-profit company that owns King's College. The company is part of the Warrnambool Presbyterian Church. The members of the school council function as the directors of the company: twelve members who serve a three-year term (although many serve multiple terms and have been council members for decades). These members are appointed by the elders of the Warrnambool Presbyterian Church, and while they may choose people who are not Presbyterians, members must affirm the Presbyterian Church of Victoria's statement of faith, and uphold their doctrines. All staff members are also expected to affirm and teach according to this.

Its founder was Julio Álvarez del Vayo. History The FELN was founded in February 1964 after the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) abandoned the armed struggle under the leadership of Santiago Carrillo, which resulted in the waning of the activity of the Spanish Maquis.Stanley G. Payne, Politics and the Military in Modern Spain. Stanford, California The new group was led by Julio Álvarez del Vayo and other communists who were disappointed by the PCE's shift in policy and who wanted to keep the armed struggle going against Francoist rule.Biografias y Vidas - Julio Álvarez del Vayo Its main points were two: *To keep the fight going on within Spain. *To carry out every necessary action in order to overthrow the Francoist Regime. FELN's line, beside being pro-Republican and anti-Francoist, was very Anti-American, being one of the first groups demanding the closure of US military bases in Spain.FELN no. 38, 4 December 1967 Álvarez del Vayo's ambition of having a Republican movement continuing the armed struggle of the Maquis within Spain was thwarted, however, by the effectiveness and ruthlessness of the Spanish police network, which included the Armed Police (Policía Armada), the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) and the Political Police Division (Brigada Político-Social). Therefore, the Spanish National Liberation Front remained small and its activity largely marginal throughout its history. Álvarez del Vayo was often gently mocked or dismissed in certain exiled Spanish Republican and Communist circles for harboring an optimism that was not founded on the realities on the ground.Álvarez del Vayo, el ultimo optimista In an interview given to Le Monde, Álvarez del Vayo claimed that the FELN had a wide base that included Socialist dissidents and that it was open to antifascist Spaniards from a wide political spectrum determined to fight against General Franco's dictatorship. He also claimed that he was not the president of the FELN.Le Monde, 27 March 1964 But some of Álvarez del Vayo's boastful declarations, such as his claim that the FELN was the \\"armed wing of the Spanish Third Republic Movement\\" (III República) —a then largely defunct Spanish republican organization formerly based in AlgiersABC (20-VI-1963)- El titulado Comité Revolucionario de la III República española establecerá una Delegación en Argelia—, were disputed by other Spanish exiles.General Franco Made Me a 'Terrorist', The Christie File: Part 2, 1964-1967 FELN published first FELN (FELN : órgano del Frente Español de Liberación Nacional), followed by ¡Frente!; both publications were crudely printed.UB - Recursos The success of the student demonstrations of May 1968 in France inspired a new vision in the FELN that brought about the creation of a new radical group together with the Communist Party of Spain (Marxist–Leninist) and Vanguardia Socialista, an obscure group led by Alberto Fernández. This vision led to the foundation of the Revolutionary and Patriotic Antifascist Front (FRAP). A more high-profile group, FRAP would continue the anti-Francoist struggle into the 1970s and Álvarez del Vayo would become the leader of the Permanent Committee of the new radical organization.FRAP - Del Vayo =The Caso Montenegro= Owing to its scant activity, the Spanish National Liberation Front remained relatively obscure throughout its existence. But in 1964 the Caso Montenegro, in which the FELN was involved, hit the headlines of the Spanish press. Even so, in press statements and newspaper articles within Spain, the name of the organization was withheld from the public. The most high-profile Spanish National Liberation Front activist was Andrés Ruiz Márquez, nicknamed Coronel Montenegro,FIJL: Boletin de Informacion - El \\"Caso Montenegro\\" member of an FELN commando and a former lieutenant of the Francoist Army who excelled in skiing. Starting 10 May 1964 he set up small bombs (actually large firecrackers) in different places across Madrid city center.

Facilities  Very popular with tourists for the views of nearby France (Évian-les-Bains, Thonon), Ouchy is also a favorite area for rollerskating (Lausanne, and Ouchy in particular, is considered a capital for this sport) and for skateboarding. The incredible views of the lake and the Alps, and the cooler air in summer have made Ouchy a popular place especially in the summer months. There is a major cluster of hotels – the Beau-Rivage Palace, the Château d'Ouchy, the Mövenpick hotel, etc. – and restaurants around the port. It is served by Lausanne Metro Line 2 from Ouchy station. In 2015, the metro station \\"Ouchy\\" was renamed \\"Ouchy-Olympique\\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the installation of the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne. The headquarters of the International Olympic Committee are at Vidy, to the west of Ouchy. The Olympic Museum and the Olympic Park (sculpture garden between the museum and the lake) are in Ouchy.  History  Once a fishing village, Ouchy was incorporated into the city of Lausanne in the mid-19th century to serve as a port on Lake Geneva. Links between the port and the city centre were improved in 1877 when Switzerland's first funicular opened. The line was converted to a rack railway in 1954, with a maintenance depot located at the Ouchy station. Eventually renamed Métro Lausanne-Ouchy, the line continued operating until 2006, when it was upgraded to become Lausanne Métro line 2. On 18 October 1912, the First Treaty of Lausanne was signed in Ouchy between Italy and the Ottoman Empire, concluding the Italo- Turkish War. Sport FC Stade Lausanne-Ouchy are based in Ouchy.

His debut novel and the first in the Six of Hearts series, it was originally released in Australia in 2006 and later published in the US. The other books in the series are Remote Control (2007), Third Transmission (2009) and Dead Man Running (2012). Plot summary The Lab is an action book, whose protagonist is a 16-year-old superhuman named Agent \\"Six of Hearts\\". Six was created to be the ultimate soldier by a group called The Lab which is a ruthless division of the company ChaoSonic. In this futuristic setting there is only one known city left in the world, and it is run by ChaoSonic. ChaoSonic took over the city and has obliterated all their competitors and enemies. Six is an agent of a vigilante organization called \\"The Deck\\" which survives by attacking ChaoSonic subsidiaries that are acting unethically, arresting the people involved and then selling off their assets. Only the King of Hearts, who saved Six from the Lab as a child, and is now his boss, is aware of the fact that Six is a superhuman developed by ChaoSonic. Six and King keep this a secret, as the Spades, another division of the Deck, would imprison Six if they knew he was a ChaoSonic creation, in case he was a threat. Six is the best agent in the Deck, having a 100% mission success rate. The Deck then begins to investigate \\"The Lab\\" and King gives Six the assignment to stop anyone from discovering his true identity. On his mission he meets Kyntak. Kyntak is genetically identical to Six, and was designed in the Lab's 'Project Falcon' alongside him. In a twisted way, they are brothers. This discovery prompts Six to reexamine his life and reevaluate his own identity. Agent Six of Hearts Six of Hearts is a fictional character created by Australian author Jack Heath (writer). Six is the protagonist in the Six of Hearts series published by Pan Macmillan (in Australian and New Zealand) and by Scholastic in the US and Canada. Six is also featured in the short story \\"404\\" published on Jack Heath's website.\\"404\\" by Jack Heath, archived 3 October 2011 =Life= Agent Six of Hearts was created by designer DNA and 'born' in The Lab, a division of Chaosonic, along with his two clones Kyntak and Sevadonn. During a fire which destroyed The Lab, Six escaped and was found by King who subsequently raised him. At the age of thirteen Six began working for The Deck; a law enforcement organisation founded by King of Hearts. =Talents= Being created from designer DNA and hence 'superhuman'; Six is able to run faster (up to 50 kilometres per hour), jump higher and is stronger than any of the other agents at The Deck. Six is also resourceful; being able to make an electromagnet from two magnetic bolts and a taser. He has also proved to be a good mechanic; creating his own motorcycle from the best parts available and being able to hotwire a car in less than 13 seconds. Six is so skilled that he is able to incapacitate his enemies without killing them and still complete the mission; as a result the other agents admire him. =Physical appearance= Six is described as having black hair, blue eyes, sharp profile, white teeth, thin fingers and pale skin. At 178 centimeters he is said to be the shortest agent in the Hearts department; however, Queen of Hearts is in fact shorter at just over 170 centimeters. Six wears a black coat and is 16 years old at the beginning of The Lab and throughout the series so far. Six also wears a pair of dogtags, a reminder of his vow to never take a human life again. =Deaths= Six, throughout the series, has 'died' on three separate occasions; once in The Lab and twice in Third Transmission. After falling from a great height onto concrete in the events of The Lab, Six is said to have died, or most of him. However, a clone of him is grown and used as an organ donor to save him. In Third Transmission, Six dies as part of the process to send him back in time. However, he will have no memory of it. Also, in the final chapter of Third Transmission titled Transmission Ends, Six dies after being shot, though critics speculate that this may not have actually happened due to a grammatical tense change.Q&A; at the New Plymouth Library, 2009Six of Hearts fansite Critical reception The Lab received mostly favourable reviews at the time of its release. The Bulletin said \\"Heath balances the flashy fight scenes with enough introspection to please both lovers of action and fans of character development\\" Quoted on Jack Heath's official website, archived 2 October 2009 and Booklist magazine praised the plot as having \\"surprisingly well-oiled wheels within wheels.\\" Jack Heath at Melbourne Writers' Festival 2009, archived 30 August 2009 io9 critic Charlie Jane Anders disagreed. \\"There's almost no character development in The Lab,\\" she said. But she conceded that the book was \\"a really fun read, and ideal for kids who aren't particularly interested in introspective coming-of-age stories . . . It's basically an action movie on paper, but it could be a nice gateway drug to reading more serious science fiction.\\"\\"Finally, A YA Book That's A Gateway Drug To Hard Science Fiction\\" by Charlie Jane Anders in io9, retrieved 30 March 2010 Publishing history Jack Heath started writing The Lab when he was 13Interview with The Rap, retrieved 30 March 2010 and attending Lyneham High School.

The charter had been in operation for approximately a week and had proven enormously popular with local people, who took their families on the journey on their day off from work as a pleasure cruise. The cost of a trip was just 8 pence, and with the day in question experiencing some unseasonable good weather, a lot of people were hoping to take a ride. Crowd surge At 1pm in the afternoon of 10 November, the Countess of Eglinton had returned to Barclay's dock, where a large crowd had gathered, hoping to join the cruise. As the previous load of passengers disembarked, the crowd waiting on the dock became anxious and began to push forward. This agitation increased rapidly, until those at the rear of the crowd surged forwards in an attempt to secure a place on the boat. Dozens of people fell into the canal, where a number drowned as they were unable to swim. Panic and capsize The real tragedy however, took place on the Countess of Eglinton herself, when the number of people surging onto the craft at one end combined with the panicked previous passengers attempting to scramble off at the other caused the boat to capsize totally, trapping over 60 people in the narrow passage along the inside of the boat with no hope of escape. Desperate attempts were made to rescue those in the water, and three people were pulled from the interior of the boat, but the majority of those inside the craft were unable to be rescued. When the barge was righted a week later, the final death toll was established at 84 people, of whom 66 were under 20 years old and 18 under 10.

British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the United Kingdom, and produces about two-thirds of the United Kingdom's quota of sugar, with the remainder covered by Tate & Lyle and imports. British Sugar and the growers fix a contract called the \\"Inter Professional Agreement\\" determining the price paid for beet grown and the allocation of growers' quotas. The National Farmers Union (NFU) is the negotiator for the growers. History The facility at Allscott, Shropshire, closed in early 2007. British Sugar factory at Bury St Edmunds seen behind the town's railway station. =Early history= The company was formed as the British Sugar Corporation in 1936, when the British parliament nationalised the entire sugar beet crop processing industry, under the banner of British Sugar Corporation. At this time, there were 13 separate companies with 18 factories across the country. In 1972, it began selling its sugar products under the name of Silver Spoon. In 1977, a rights issue decreased the government holding from 36% to 24%. In May 1982, the company name was shortened to British Sugar plc, and later that year it was taken over by Berisford International. After a crash in property values affected Berisford, it was sold to Associated British Foods (ABF) on 2 January 1991. =Closures= In 1981, the Ely, Felsted, Nottingham and Selby factories closed after a reduction in the allowed sugar quota. This was followed by the closure of sites at Spalding in 1989, Peterborough and Brigg in 1991, King's Lynn in 1994, Bardney and Ipswich in 2001, Kidderminster in 2002, and Allscott and York in 2007. The site at Allscott, which opened in 1927, near Telford, Shropshire, was closed because it \\"lacked scale\\" to be run economically, while the site at York, North Yorkshire (opened 1926), was closed due to the poor crop yields in northern England. Of the 18 factories which were owned by the British Sugar Corporation, only four still process beet - Bury St Edmunds (Suffolk), Cantley (in Norfolk, the second and first successful British sugar factory in 1912), Newark-on-Trent (Nottinghamshire) and Wissington (western Norfolk and the largest in Europe). The Bury site is also a major packaging plant for Silver Spoon. The 12 sites already closed have been sold and decommissioned to various degrees - many large concrete silos (for storing the major product, white granulated sugar) still remain even where the sites have been closed, including those at the Kidderminster factory which was closed in 2002 and sold off in 2006. The concrete silos at the Ipswich site were demolished in 2018, 17 years after the site closed. Allscott has now been completely demolished. Spalding has been replaced by Spalding power station. BP and DuPont are working with British Sugar to build a bioethanol plant at BP's Hull site, as described in an announcement made on June 2007.

History Previously known as St Thenew's Gait (the way to the supposed site of St Thenew\`s burial) it was around the start of the 1500s that the name Trongate first began to be used.

The 27th Armoured Brigade was formed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 1940 by the conversion of the 1st Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade as a constituent of the newly raised 9th Armoured Division. The brigade was used to experiment with specialised armoured vehicles and on 8 September 1942 it was transferred to the 79th Armoured Division, which concentrated the various specialised armour units. On 20 October 1943 27th Armoured Brigade became an independent GHQ formation, and was attached to the 3rd Infantry Division to spearhead I Corps' landing at Sword on D-Day in June 1944.Fortin, p. 58 Order of battle * 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards (left 31 January 1944) * 13th/18th Royal Hussars (left 29 July 1944) * 1st East Riding Yeomanry (left 8 October 1943, rejoined 14 February 1944, left 29 July 1944) * 148th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (from 8 October 1943, left 31 January 1944) * Staffordshire Yeomanry (from 14 February 1944, left 29 July 1944) * 1st Battalion, Queen Victoria's Rifles (from 2 December 1940, redesignated 7th Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps 1 April 1941) * 7th Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (from 1 April 1941, left 13 April 1943) Commanders * Brigadier C.W.

Prior-Palmer (from 25 April 1943) Operational history The brigade was assigned a crucial role in the Normandy landings. 13/18th Hussars, equipped with M4 Sherman DD amphibious tanks, would accompany the initial assault on Sword by 3rd Division's 8th Brigade Group, while the rest of 27th Armoured Bde would support the division's follow-up attacks towards Caen. =D-Day= Men of No. 4 Commando engaged in house to house fighting with the Germans at Riva Bella, near Ouistreham. Sherman DD tanks of 'B' Squadron, 13th/18th Royal Hussars are providing fire support and cover, 6 June 1944. On the morning of D-Day the sea was rough and 27th Armoured Brigade's commander, Brigadier G.E. Prior-Palmer, in conjunction with Captain Bush, Royal Navy, decided to launch his DD tanks closer inshore than had been planned. Thirty-four out of 40 DD tanks of 'A' and 'B' Squadrons of 13/18th Hussars were launched from their LCTs (Landing Craft Tank) 5000 yards from Sword. One sank immediately and the remainder made slow progress in the heavy seas and were overtaken by the leading landing craft carrying infantry and 'flail' tanks. Two DD tanks were struck by landing craft and lost on the run in. The remaining six tanks of 13/18th Hussars were taken in to the beach aboard their LCT. The regiment lost six tanks knocked out in the surf and four shortly after, leaving 27 to support the infantry in their advance off the beach. One squadron supported 1st Battalion, Suffolk Regiment in their attack on the 'Hillman' strongpoint. Another squadron assisted No. 4 Commando to capture Ouistreham on the left flank of the beachhead. 'C' Squadron landed last, towing waterproofed sledges containing the ammunition reserve, but took a long time to get clear of the beach.Ellis pp. 172–4, 184, 202.McKee pp. 53–4. The Shermans of the Staffordshire Yeomanry landed later on the morning of D-Day to support 185th Brigade, the spearhead of 3rd Division's attack inland. This was probably the only unit of conventional tanks landed that day on Sword. The advance was to be led by a mobile column of 2nd Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (KSLI) riding on the Staffordshire Yeomanry's tanks, but at noon the infantry's heavy weapons were still held up on the congested beaches, and the tanks by a minefield. The leading tanks caught up with the infantry at the Periers rise, but four tanks were knocked out by flank fire from German guns in a wood, which had to be dealt with. By 1600 hours one squadron of the Staffordshire Yeomanry was with the advanced infantry and self-propelled 17-pounders from 20th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery at Beuville and Bieville on the direct road to Caen, a second was supporting the attack on 'Hillman', and the third was guarding the flank at Point 61 on the Periers rise. Soon afterwards a scouting troop of the Staffordshires reported about 40 German tanks advancing fast.Ellis pp. 203–4. These were 22 Panzer Regiment 22 from Major- General Edgar Feuchtinger's 21st Panzer Division, primarily equipped with Panzer IV tanks, supplemented with obsolete French SOMUA S35 tanks and self- propelled anti-tank guns on various French chassis. These panzers had already taken losses when attacked by Typhoon fighter-bombers on the road from Caen.Ellis p. 204. The Staffordshire squadron from Hillman was quickly brought up, and several of the German tanks were knocked out by the Staffordshires and the anti-tank guns of the 2nd KSLI and 20th A/T Regt. The panzers turned aside into the woods, pursued by the Yeomanry and by field-gun fire, and took further losses when they showed themselves again. Drawing off a second time, the Panzers were reinforced and then made a wide detour towards the Periers ridge. Here they were met and driven off by the squadron positioned there. The British claimed 13 panzers knocked out for the loss of one SP gun. Fuechtinger later reported that his division lost 54 out of 124 tanks in these actions and by the earlier Typhoon attacks. However, at nightfall his division was still interposed between British I Corps and its objective, the city of Caen. The city did not fall for another month, greatly dislocating the British operations.Ellis p. 204. The third regiment of 27th Armoured Brigade, the East Riding Yeomanry (also equipped with Sherman DD tanks) landed later on D-Day with 3rd Division's reserve, 9th Brigade Group. =The Battle for Caen= During the follow-up operations after D-Day the 27th Armoured Brigade continued to support I Corps' attacks along the River Orne towards Caen. On 11 June a squadron of 13/18th Hussars supported 6th Airborne Division's attacks along the river, and later in the month the regiment supported 51st (Highland) Infantry Division in further attacks along the river. On 8 and 9 July, 27th Armoured Brigade supported I Corps' final successful attack on Caen. =Operation Goodwood= On 18 July Second British Army began a major offensive south from Caen (Operation Goodwood). I Corps' task was to attack along the left flank of the main armoured thrust. 3rd Division plus one brigade from 51st Division moved forward at 0745 hours, supported by 27th Armoured Brigade. The German reception by troops of the 346th Infantry Division and 16th Luftwaffe Field Division was varied: the villages of Sannerville and Banneville la Campagne had been well hit by the preliminary attack by RAF Bomber Command and both were in British hands by midday. Touffreville, on the other hand, was on the edge of Bomber Command's target area, and it held out until evening. There was heavy fighting in the mined and broken country through which the road ran to Troarn. Attacking by that route and from Sannerville, 3rd Division found Troarn strongly defended and at nightfall was still about a mile short of the town. Between Manneville and Guillerville, south of the Troarn–Caen road, there was stiff fighting against the German infantry of 711th Infantry Division, rushed up by bicycle from the coast, supported by some Tiger tanks. It was midnight when both villages were cleared. The day's fighting had cost the British 500 casualties and 18 tanks.Ellis p. 343. At dawn the following day infantry of 3rd Division were working their way through orchards towards Troarn. The place was well- defended, with well-sited outlying infantry positions. The division put in four successive attacks during the day, supported by 27th Armoured Bde, but none was successful. I Corps was reinforced, but the Goodwood offensive petered out the following day.Ellis p. 346. =Disbandment= After 'Goodwood' Second Army's emphasis switched away from the Caen sector and on 27 July 1944 27th Armoured Brigade was broken up, its three regiments being distributed to other formations.Ellis p. 522.

Ultraviolet photography is a photographic process of recording images by using light from the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum only. Images taken with ultraviolet light serve a number of scientific, medical or artistic purposes. Images may reveal deterioration of art works or structures not apparent under visible light. Diagnostic medical images may be used to detect certain skin disorders or as evidence of injury. Some animals, particularly insects, use ultraviolet wavelengths for vision; ultraviolet photography can help investigate the markings of plants that attract insects, while invisible to the unaided human eye. Ultraviolet photography of archaeological sites may reveal artifacts or traffic patterns not otherwise visible. Photographs made of various dyes that fluoresce under ultraviolet illumination are also useful. Overview Ultraviolet image of the globular cluster NGC 1851 in the southern constellation Columba. Light which is visible to the human eye covers the spectral region from about 400 to 750 nanometers. This is the radiation spectrum used in normal photography. The band of radiation that extends from about 1 nm to 400 nm is known as ultraviolet radiation. UV spectrographers divide this range into three bands: * near UV (380–200 nm wavelength; abbrev. NUV) * far UV (or vacuum UV) (200–10 nm; abbrev. FUV or VUV) * extreme UV (1–31 nm; abbrev. EUV or XUV). Only near UV is of interest for UV photography, for several reasons. Ordinary air is opaque to wavelengths below about 200 nm, and lens glass is opaque below about 180 nm. UV photographers subdivide the near UV into: * Long wave UV that extends from 320 to 400 nm, also called UV-A, * Medium wave UV that extends from 280 to 320 nm, also called UV-B, * Short wave UV that extends from 200 to 280 nm, also called UV-C. (These terms should not be confused with the parts of the radio spectrum with similar names.) There are two ways to use UV radiation to take photographs - reflected ultraviolet and ultraviolet induced fluorescence photography. Reflected ultraviolet photography finds practical use in medicine, dermatology, botany, criminology and theatrical applications. Sunlight is the most available free UV radiation source for use in reflected UV photography, but the quality and quantity of the radiation depends on atmospheric conditions. A bright and dry day is much richer in UV radiation and is preferable to a cloudy or rainy day. Another suitable source is electronic flash which can be used efficiently in combination with an aluminium reflector. Some flash units have a special UV absorbing glass over the flash tube, which must be removed before the exposure. It also helps to partly (90%) remove the gold coating of some flash tubes which otherwise suppresses UV. Most modern UV sources are based on a mercury arc sealed in a glass tube. By coating the tube internally with a suitable phosphor, it becomes an effective long wave UV source. Recently, UV- LEDs have become available. Grouping several UV-LEDs can produce a strong enough source for reflected UV photography although the emission waveband is typically somewhat narrower than sunlight or electronic flash. Special UV lamps known as \\"black light\\" fluorescence tubes or bulbs also can be used for long wave ultraviolet photography. Equipment and techniques =Reflected UV photography= A portrait taken using only UV light between the wavelengths of 335 and 365 nanometers. In reflected UV photography the subject is illuminated directly by UV emitting lamps (radiation sources) or by strong sunlight. A UV transmitting filter is placed on the lens, which allows ultraviolet light to pass and which absorbs or blocks all visible and infrared light. UV filters are made from special colored glass and may be coated or sandwiched with other filter glass to aid in blocking unwanted wavelengths. Examples of UV transmission filters are the Baader-U filter or the StraightEdgeU ultraviolet bandpass filter, both of which exclude most visible and infrared light. Older filters include the Kodak Wratten 18A, B+W 403, Hoya U-340 and Kenko U-360 most of which need to be used in conjunction with an additional infrared blocking filter. Typically such IR blocking, UV transmissive filters are made from Schott BG-38, BG-39 and BG-40 glass. Filters for use with digital camera sensors must not have any \\"infrared leak\\" (transmission in the infrared spectrum); the sensor will pick up reflected infrared radiation as well as ultraviolet, which may obscure the details that would be resolved by ultraviolet alone. Most types of glass will allow longwave UV to pass, but absorb all the other UV wavelengths, usually from about 350 nm and below. For UV photography it is necessary to use specially developed lenses having elements made from fused quartz or quartz and fluorite. Lenses based purely on quartz show a distinct focus shift between visible and UV light, whereas the fluorite/quartz lenses can be fully corrected between visible and ultraviolet light without focus shift. Examples of the latter type are the Nikon UV-Nikkor 105 mm f/4.5, the Coastal Optics 60 mm f/4.0, the Hasselblad (Zeiss) UV-Sonnar 105 mm, and the Asahi Pentax Ultra Achromatic Takumar 85 mm f/3.5Medical photography; Clinical-Ultraviolet- Infrared. (1973) Gibson HL, Kodak Company, Rochester, p123-130. Suitable digital cameras for reflected UV photography have been reported to be the (unmodified) Nikon D70 or D40 DSLRs, but many others are suitable after having their internal UV and IR blocking filter removed. The Fujifilm FinePix IS Pro digital SLR camera is purpose-designed for ultraviolet (and infrared) photography, with a frequency response rated from 1000-380 nm, although it also responds to somewhat longer and shorter wavelengths. Silicon (from which DSLR sensors are made) can respond to wavelengths between 1100-190 nm. =UV induced fluorescence photography= Fluorescent materials lit by UV light. No filter is used to absorb violet visible light. Photo taken with daylight film Photography based on visible fluorescence induced by UV radiation uses the same ultraviolet illumination as in reflected UV photography. However, the glass barrier filter used on the lens must now absorb or block all ultraviolet and infrared light and must permit only the visible radiation to pass. Visible fluorescence is produced in a suitable subject when the shorter, higher energy ultraviolet wavelengths are absorbed, lose some energy and are emitted as longer, lower energy visible wavelengths. UV induced visible fluorescence photography must take place in a darkened room, preferably with a black background. The photographer should also wear dark-colored clothes for better results. (Many light-colored fabrics also fluoresce under UV.) Any camera or lens may be used because only visible wavelengths are being recorded. UV can also induce infrared fluorescence and UV fluorescence depending on the subject. For UV induced non-visible fluorescence photography, a camera must be modified in order to capture UV or IR images, and UV or IR capable lenses must be used. Filters are sometimes added to the UV illumination source to narrow the illuminant waveband. This filter is called an exciter filter, and it allows only the radiation to pass which is needed to induce a particular fluorescence. As before, a barrier filter must also be placed in front of the camera lens to exclude undesired wavelengths. Forensic use Ultraviolet photography was used as evidence in court at least as early as 1934.Larry S. Miller, Norman Marin, Police Photography, Routledge, 2014 . page 5 Photographs made with ultraviolet radiation can reveal bruises or scars not visible on the surface of the skin, in some cases long after visible healing has completed.

Brant was born near the current site of Brantford, Ontario, the son of Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea) and Catharine Croghan Brant (Adonwentishon). His father Joseph was a Mohawk chief who became famous during the American Revolutionary War. His mother Catharine was from an important Mohawk lineage: while her father was the Irish trader George Croghan, her mother was the sister of Johannes Tekarihoga, one of the hereditary Mohawk civil leaders (or sachems). Because the Mohawks were a matrilineal society, the title \\"Tekarihoga\\" did not pass from father to son. Instead, the women in the family selected the next Tekarihoga from their male relatives. As Clan Mother, Catharine Brant would name Johannes Tekarihoga's successor. At a young age, her son John became an obvious candidate for the next Tekarihoga. The family moved near Burlington Bay in 1802. John Brant studied at Ancaster and Niagara (Niagara-on-the-Lake). In the War of 1812, Brant and John Norton led native warriors to stop an American attack at the Battle of Queenston Heights in October 1812. He was made a lieutenant in the Indian Department and was involved in several battles throughout the war. He helped his uncle try to get a formal deed for grant of land along the Grand River called the Haldimand Proclamation to the Six Nations. In 1821, he went to England with Robert Johnson Kerr after Lieutenant Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland informed them that they had no title to the northern part of the grant. Despite their efforts, the government of the colony managed to retain control over the sale of native lands in the area. Brant encouraged the building of schools for his people. In 1828, he was appointed resident superintendent for the Six Nations of the Grand River. In 1830, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Haldimand. He was the first Indian to sit in Upper Canada's parliament as a lawmaker. But a year later, his right to hold the seat was questioned as he did not own the amount of property required under the law at the time to sit in the Assembly, and he was thrown out of office. John Warren was declared elected. ; Lefroy, On the Probable Number of the Native Population of British North America, 1853, p. 13 In about 1830 his mother Catharine named him as the next Tekarihoga, succeeding his recently deceased uncle Henry Tekarihoga. Brant held the office for only a short time; he died in 1832 near Brantford, a victim of a cholera pandemic.  References  *Kelsay, Isabel Thompson. Joseph Brant, 1743–1807, Man of Two Worlds.

John Howard, the then Australian Prime Minister announced the introduction of the scheme on 26 April 2006. Under the scheme, the card would be required for personal identification by an Australian citizen or permanent resident wishing to access benefits or services administered by the Department of Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs or (from 2010) the universal Medicare. The scheme was to be phased in over two years, beginning in 2008, but the newly elected Labor Rudd Government terminated the project in November 2007.  Scope  It was proposed that the Access Card would be required for identification purposes in accessing government benefits or services, such as: * Welfare benefits administered by Centrelink, including: unemployment, disability, veterans, and study allowances. * The Health Care Card and Seniors Health Card. * Medicare subsidised health care, both bulk-billing and claim back. * The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which provides subsidised medications. * Child Support Agency Australia services. * CRS Australia vocational rehabilitation. Card description  The Access Card was to have been a smartcard. Smartcard technology differs from ordinary magnetic strip cards in that the card contains a microchip rather than a simple magnetic strip. This means that instead of the card containing a number that relates to a record in a database, the data (usually encrypted) is actually stored on the card. The Card was intended to have a photograph, the usual name of the holder – it did not have to be the legal name – the signature, the expiry date and the ID Number all visible on the front or rear of the Card. The chip was expected to include legal name, address, date of birth, details of children or other dependants, digitised photo, signature, card number, expiry date, gender, concession status and the cardholder's Personal Identification Number (PIN). Additional personal information could also be added at the will of the card holder. Such information may have included next of kin, organ donor status or drug allergies and also, according to Joe Hockey the former responsible government minister, shopping lists and perhaps MP3s. This extra information was to be secured with the user's PIN, so only those who needed it had access to it. Parliamentary process An exposure draft of the proposed Bill was published on 13 December 2006 allowing for a four-week period during which public submissions could be made. Some minor changes resulted. The Bill to implement the first stage of the scheme was the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007 which was tabled in the Senate. A Senate Inquiry started on 8 February 2007, run by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The Committee called for submissions and heard testimony, then wrote a report all within six weeks. The Report was delivered on 15 March 2007 and was scathing of the Bill in the form presented, demanding it be withdrawn and key provisions be re-thought. It also strongly recommended that the oversight and privacy provisions not await a later unseen Bill but be included in one package. The Minister, Senator Chris Ellison, withdrew the Bill to implement the Committees recommendations. A notable feature was that the Majority Report was written by Liberal Senators Mason, Fifield and Watson, recognised by some commentators as a striking case of Senatorial independence. Other reactions =Objections= One of the criticisms of the Access Card proposal was that the requirement for the card to be produced to access welfare and medical services made the card, in effect, compulsory. It was suggested that this was another attempt establish an Australia Card. On the other hand, Department of Human Services Secretary, Patricia Scott, told a Senate committee on 16 February 2007 that the wrongful detention of Cornelia Rau – who was held by immigration authorities for 10 months, despite being a legal resident – would not have occurred if the Access Card was running. = Function creep and unintended outcomes = The Card was to be the physical manifestation of the National Identity Register, containing the 17 classes of information outlined in the Act. The supporters of the Bill pointed to prohibitions within the Bill and the invoking of the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 to protect this information. At hearings in March 2007, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Federal Police confirmed that all such information would be available to them without warrant. This was not put forward as part of the original case, and if anything was denied as a possible outcome. The Australian Bankers Association also called for limited access to the database to help prove identity of new customers. =Privacy= The Government established a Consumer and Privacy Taskforce under former competition commission head Prof Allan Fels, which issued a discussion paper raising privacy concerns on 15 June 2006. The first report by the Taskforce was released in September 2006 and in November 2006 the Government rejected or partly rejected four of the 26 recommendations made by the taskforce.  Implementation  On 22 January 2007, in a cabinet reshuffle, Joe Hockey, who had been heading the Access Card project, was appointed Workplace Relations Minister. Ian Campbell was appointed Minister for Human Services, taking over the implementation of the Access Card project in an election year. On 3 March, Campbell resigned as Minister, and was replaced by Senator Chris Ellison, formerly the Justice Minister. The project's chief technology officer was Marie Johnson. The Office of Access Card issued a systems integrator request for tender (RFT) closing on 1 March 2007, with the contract expected to be signed between May and June 2007 . The 2007 election was called on 17 October 2007. = Software = The card was to have two card software platforms: * a card management system (CMS) to manage and track access cards throughout their seven-year lifecycle. * a key management system (KMS) to provide security protections for card data. = Registration = Registration was to have required an interview, planned to average 12 minutes, during which a biometric photo would have been taken. Applicants would have been required to produce sufficient identification documentation, similar to the 100-point check that is required for access to financial services. This documentation would have been copied or scanned for permanent storage. Registration was to have occurred at special offices in the initial two-year registration period, and then at selected Post Offices at every seven-year renewal.  Closing of project  In November 2007 the newly elected Labor Rudd Government announced it was terminating the Access Card project, the Office of the Access Card and all associated entities. The Labor Party had initially supported the Access Card in principle, but with caveats over its implementation. However, in October the half way house policy was abandoned and a complete repudiation was decided upon.  Similar programs in other countries  The United Kingdom introduced the British national identity card, a non-compulsory identity card in 2006, which was abandoned in 2010. France has had a similar, but less sophisticated, card for many years: the French national identity card. Other European and Asian countries also have national identity cards. For example, Singapore has since 1965 had the National Registration Identity Card.

Formed in 2019 through a merger of The Scots School, Bathurst (commonly referred to as Scots) with a history dating back to 1946, and the former All Saints' College in Bathurst with a history dating back to 1874, the College provides a religious and general education to approximately 700 children covering early learning through Year K to Year 12. The College is administered by a board appointed by the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in New South Wales. History = The Scots School =  Before Foundation  The property on which the Bathurst campus of The Scots School was built in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Originally called \\"Karralee\\", it was owned by cattle and horse breeder John Lee. It is located in Kelso, New South Wales. It was bought by the trustees of the family of William Arnott (died 1901)of Arnott's Biscuits in the 1930s as a home for his daughter.  1940s  In 1942, The Scots College in Sydney leased the property for the relocation of its students from Bellevue Hill, Sydney, because of the fear of Japanese naval bombardment. The Scots College operated in Bathurst until 1945 when it moved back to Sydney. However many boys from central New South Wales were enrolled in the school and their parents asked the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church of Australia in New South Wales to continue the school at Bathurst. Consequently, the Trustees bought \\"Karralee\\" and established the Scots School, Bathurst.  1990s  In 1997 the school changed from a high school (Years 7-12) to also cater for primary school students, and opened the preparatory school in the old Cooerwull boarding house, thus becoming K-12. In early 1997 the school Board decided that the school should change from being a boys only school to being co-educational, and the first female students were admitted in term 4 1997.The Scots School - History (accessed:20-07-2012) = All Saints College =  Early years to 1900s  In 1873 Canon Thomas Smith of All Saints' Cathedral, Bathurst, with the support of Bishop Samuel Marsden began the process of starting the School. The following year, on 27 January, the Bathurst Church of England College opened its doors to seven students under the headmastership of Henry Kemmis. Renamed All Saints' College, the school officially came into being in mid-2030 when it moved to its permanent site on the corner of Piper and Hope Streets after a successful fund raising campaign and the Bishop's donation of land. In 1888 Edward Bean, the Senior Classics Master of Sydney Grammar, and father of C.E.W. Bean, succeeded Henry Kemmis. During the eleven years of his headmastership, the College enrolment grew significantly. Bean produced the badge and motto, designed the uniform, commenced the Bathurstian (the school year book), introduced the prefect system, cadets, debating, dancing and carpentry, as well as opening a library and the Prep School. The third Headmaster was Frederick Tracey. During his tenure representatives of the College attended meetings in 1892 to set up the Athletics Association of the Great Public Schools of New South Wales; the College didn't proceed to active membership of the GPS and has never taken part in any of its activities. In 1893 the Old Bathurstians' Union was started. With their support, Tracey purchased the school from the Church, thus becoming its proprietor, a position he maintained until 1919 when he sold the land and buildings to the NSW Government.  1900s to 1950s  Originally the Assistant Master under Bean and the fourth Headmaster was Mr Britten. During his tenure the College became involved in rugby, football and cricket; several boys went on to play for NSW and Australia. He also persuaded the Old Bathurstians' Union to finance the building of a Chapel which they later moved brick by brick to the College's present location on the then Ophir Road, now Eglinton Road. In 1911 Britten was succeeded by George Stiles. A linguist and an amateur boxing champion at Oxford University, he promoted French and German and brought boxing to the College. With the coming of war in 1914, enrolments dropped, staff became difficult to obtain and prices soared. On 30 June 1919, Stiles resigned and the College closed. In 1923 the headmaster of Grammar School, Cooma, and one of his staff, Cameron McLeod, sought permission to re-open the College on its present site after purchasing Esrom House and 2 acres of adjoining land. The nearby Travellers' Rest Hotel was purchased for additional classrooms, and Walmer House on the river was leased for boarders. In 1925 the OBU moved the Chapel from the schools' original location to its current site on the existing school grounds. In 1946 Lindsay Watson retired and was succeeded by Alan Catley, who resigned in 1948 and was succeeded by Ted Evans as headmaster, for fifteen years. During this time the College grew from a student population of 108 to 315.  1960s to 2000s  In 1963 Roy Dent, founding Headmaster of Sydney Grammar Preparatory School, took over from Evans. He oversaw the inauguration of the Avern Award (for meritorious service to the College) and the republication of the history of the College. In 1966 there were three headmasters: Roy Dent resigned, Vic Tunbridge of Geelong Grammar took over as acting Headmaster, and later in the year the Council appointed Peter Gebhardt as the tenth Headmaster. He introduced programmes including Eastern-Western Week (work experience), Outdoor Education and Arts and Artists Week, most of which continue today. He also initiated the building of the H.R. Richardson Memorial Library and Watson College (now Watson Boarding House). Dan Massey was appointed Headmaster in 1975. He introduced co-education in 1976, and was instrumental in the College amalgamating with Marsden Girls School in 1977. In 1982 the Junior School was reopened under Doug Finlay. Dan Massey resigned at the end of 1983 and Deputy Headmaster Bruce Clydsdale, took over until Robert Bickerdike was appointed in 1985. Previously Principal of Girton College and Head of Geelong Grammar's Timbertop, Mr Robert Bickerdike was headmaster for eight years, during which buildings were added and student numbers increased. Doug Finlay left as Master of the Junior School in December 1989 and was succeeded by Jock Bidwell in January 1990. In 1993 Timothy Wright, formerly Second Master at Trinity Grammar Sydney, became headmaster. During his time as Headmaster, formal Pastoral Care Structure was developed and implemented within the College timetable. Wright oversaw the development of College facilities such as the building of the Foundation Block and the Evans Block, and the refurbishment of the Science Labs. The second stage of the Junior School Development was also completed during his time. In 1998 the inaugural Transition to School class commenced with a full complement. Dr Wright was appointed to Shore (Sydney Church of England Grammar School) in 2003.  2000s to 2018  Jenny Williams joined All Saints' College from Snowy Mountains Grammar at the start of 2003. She continued the development of the College, overseeing the refurbishment of Britten House, the Dining Room, the Music and IT Centres and the front of Esrom House. Williams remained as Head of College until 20 March 2008 when she accepted the position of Head of Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, New Zealand. During the interim period following Williams' departure and the arrival of the present Head, Stewart Ross (Head of Senior School) took over as Acting Head of College. At the end of 2007 Jock Bidwell resigned as Head of Junior School after 18 years in post; he and his wife travelled to Tanzania to work at the School of St Jude. Christopher Jackman took up the role of Head of Junior School from the start of the 2008 academic year. Peter Miller was appointed Head of College at the start of Term 3, 2008. He had previously been Head of Middle School at Barker College, Sydney. Miller had received a Rowing Blue at Sydney University and represented Australia in the Senior B Lightweight Four. Mr Steven O'Connor started as Head of College at the start of Term 2, 2016. All Saints' College was purchased by the Presbyterian Church NSW in 2017 and merged with The Scots School, Bathurst in 2018. The College became Scots All Saints College with its first official year of operation in 2019 as the Foundation Year.

A member of the French Socialist Party, he was deputy for Landes from 1978 to 1981, from 1986 to 1997, and from 2000 to 2017.  Early life and career  Emmanuelli was born in Eaux-Bonnes in the French department of Pyrénées- Atlantiques. He grew up with a working-class background and lost his father at a very young age. He studied at Sciences Po in Paris. He joined in 1969 the Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild.Jim Jarrassé, La banque Rothschild, un vivier de politiques, Le Figaro, August 27, 2014 In 1971, he was appointed to the management of this company, becoming a senior banking executive and then a co-director in 1975. He continued his professional career at the Rothschild Bank until he was elected at the French National Assembly at age 32 in 1978.  Political career  He joined the Socialist Party in 1971. On the request of François Mitterrand he was, at the age of 27, a candidate in the legislative elections of March 1973 in the second circonscription of Lot-et- Garonne. But it was on March 19, 1978 that he was elected for the first time as the deputy for the third electoral district of Landes, which moved the district to the left-wing. In 1982, he was elected for the first time as the President of the General Council of Landes. Between 1981 and 1986, he served in the governments of Pierre Mauroy and Laurent Fabius as the Secretary of State charged with the DOM-TOM territories of France and between 1981 and 1983, as Secretary of State for Budget between 1983 and 1986, and Secretary of State for Consumption between 1984 and 1986. Between January 1992 and April 1993, he was chairman of the National Assembly. He was then elected First Secretary of the Socialist Party in June 1994 and held this office until October 1995. His election to this position was seen as revenge for the Mitterrand wing of the Socialist Party against Michel Rocard, the incumbent First Secretary, who had been weakened by the party's poor result in the 1994 European Parliament election. However, he was defeated by Lionel Jospin in the race to represent the Socialist Party in the 1995 presidential election.Thomas Sancton, Time Magazine, February 20, 1995. Jospin also took on the role of First Secretary of the party in October 1995. One year later, Emmanuelli was convicted for the illicit financing of the party when he was its treasurer. He re-entered politics in 2000. Whilst he was a faithful supporter of François Mitterrand until the latter's death, he is identified as belonging to the left-wing of the Socialist Party, and was one of the leaders of the party's \\"New World\\" faction formed in 2002 which aimed to steer the party leftwards after Jospin's poor performance in that year's presidential election.Bruce Crumley, Time Magazine, September 8, 2002. In the campaigns for the Referendum on the European Constitution in 2005 and the Treaty of Rome of 2004, he publicly declared himself in favour of the no campaign which put him in direct opposition to the official line of the Socialist Party which was in favour of the treaty. He believed that the treaty was a move away from the idea of a Federal Europe, which he endorsed, notably in his “Plea for Europe”.John Henley, The Guardian, May 30, 2005.John Nichols, The Nation, May 31, 2005. He is followed by his close supporters, one of which is Michel Vergnier, the deputy for la Creuse. In 2000, he took part in the Congress of Grenoble of the Socialist Party and was an avid campaigner for a Socialist Party which was clearly aligned to the left. For the Congress of Mans in November 2005, he associated himself with the New Socialist Party motion of Arnaud Montebourg, Vincent Peillon et Benoît Hamon.

The full name of the investigation was the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation. The Commissioner was Sir Ronald Davison. The Commission concluded that there were no grounds supporting the allegations of fraud and corruption. The inquiry was characterized by extensive litigation, both during and afterwards and by an extremely high level of public interest. The Commission was established in September 1994 and reported nearly three years later in August 1997. Popular name The Commission became popularly known as the Winebox Inquiry, as Winston Peters brought the documents at the centre of the allegations to Parliament in a winebox. The box contained numerous documents relating to a range of transactions entered into or contemplated by a number of parties. History In 1992, New Zealand politician Winston Peters made repeated claims in Parliament of criminality associated with tax planning undertaken by some of New Zealand’s largest companies (some involving tax deals with the Cook Islands) as well as fraud and incompetence by both the Inland Revenue Department and the Serious Fraud Office. Journalist Ian Wishart was assigned by the TV3 network to report on the case, He came into possession of documents relating to tax avoidance and tax evasion; known as the \\"Winebox\\" documents as they were in an old wine carton. Wishart investigated them in secret for TV3 and then TVNZ, but the proposed December 1993 broadcast was stopped by the TVNZ board and a court injunction. After Wishart leaked details of the programme, it was however eventually broadcast in June 1994 as a special primetime two-hour broadcast. Public pressure eventually forced the government to set up the inquiry in 1994. The terms of reference of the Commission of Inquiry required it to report upon whether the Inland Revenue Department and the Serious Fraud Office had acted in a lawful, proper and competent manner in dealing with the relevant transactions, and to examine whether any changes to the criminal or tax laws should be made to protect New Zealand's income tax base from the effects of fraud, evasion and avoidance. The Magnum Transaction The transaction at the centre of the Winebox Inquiry was known as the “Magnum” transaction. In fact the documents in the winebox outlined more than 60 different transactions involving a range of parties. In September 1986 a European Pacific Investments subsidiary based in New Zealand lent money to another subsidiary based in the Cook Islands. Withholding taxes of $2 million on that loan were paid to the Cook Islands Tax Office, and a tax certificate for that sum was duly issued. European Pacific presented this certificate to the tax office in New Zealand, and as there was no further New Zealand tax to pay, paid a dividend to an investor, called Magnum, a brewery. In the Cook Islands, another member of the EPI group received a financial benefit from the Cook Islands government, and simultaneously forgave a loan to the government. The net effect: one EPI company received a benefit of $850,000 from the Cook Islands government, and yet another subsidiary received a New Zealand tax credit of $2 million. Controversy Although the Commission concluded that there was no fraud or incompetence, controversy surrounded these rulings. The Law Commission identifiedThe Role of Public Inquiries at page 53 four court cases which arose during or immediately after the inquiry; this indicates the degree of litigation and controversy surrounding it. Other court cases also surfaced, for example against TVNZ, in relation to the inquiry's subject matter. Subsequent appeals were made seeking to overturn the Commission’s findings. Most notable of these was a case for judicial review initiated by Winston Peters against the Commissioner, which effectively resulted in an upholding of Davison’s findings.The Honourable Winston Raymond Peters v The Right Honourable Sir Ronald Keith Davison 1998 NZAR LEXIS 6; [1998] NZAR 309 A subsequent ruling of the Court of AppealPeters v Davison 1998 NZLR LEXIS 70; [1999] 2 NZLR 164 overturned this finding and referred the matter back to the High Court. The final ruling of the High CourtPeters v Davison [1999] 3 NZLR 744 was that four of the findings of the commission which related to the Magnum transaction were struck out as a result of errors in law by the commission. Also struck out were associated criticisms by Winston Peters to the extent that they related to those errors in law. The Court stated:Peters v Davison [1999] 3 NZLR 744 at paragraph 94 :“Declarations (1) to (4) [striking out the findings relating to Magnum] are not, and are not intended to suggest, findings by this Court that there has been fraud or incompetence. The effect of the declarations is as if the words in the Winebox report to which they relate were crossed out, leaving the Winebox report incomplete in these respects. Declaration (5) [striking out the related criticism of Winston Peters] will ameliorate the criticisms made of the plaintiff which are related to those errors. The Winebox report remains otherwise unaffected.” Both sides to the debate claimed victory. Aftermath Changes to tax laws relating to the claiming of foreign tax credits were made. New rules relating to disclosure to the Inland Revenue Department and penalties for non-compliance were introduced.

The station's studios and transmitter are located at Unit 907, 9th floor of Paragon Plaza, EDSA corner Reliance Street, Mandaluyong City. History =1980s: Early programming and \\"The Battle of the Radios\\" trend= The station began its regular operations on February 14, 1986, under the ownership of the CDC Radio Network, Inc., and broadcasting from the now- demolished Philippine Communications Center building (PHILCOMCEN) in Pasig City, starting with a 10 on-air crew led by Bernie Buenaseda, known on-air as \\"Burning Bernie\\". It became a witness to history unfolding before the Filipinos as the station was also started 11 days before the late Corazon \\"Cory\\" Aquino became president and 7 months exactly before ABS-CBN was reopened. At that time, DWTM operated 21 hours a day, starting its broadcast day at 5 am until signing off the following morning at 2 am. Between 1988 and 1989, the station started broadcasting 24 hours a day, which turned out to be a huge success. \\"The Battle of the Radios\\" during that era, was supported by a wide variety of spoofs and gimmicks not to mention sidekicks, (no computers, no hard drives; just a bunch of wires and switches,) which made broadcasting ultra-creative as compared to that done with the digital technology of today. =1990s: The emergence of Love Notes= Magic 89.9 became the first home of \\"Love Notes\\" that started in 1988, which was initially conceptualized as a gimmick. The 15 minute counseling program hosted by Joe D'Mango became an instant hit with office workers every Friday morning. Love Notes is also aired on ABC-5 from 1993 to 1998 and became an eponymous movie that produced by VIVA Films in 1995. It transferred to its sister station Wave 89.1 in 2001. The show returned on DZMM in 2011, but moved to Radyo Singko in 2012, and lasted until 2013. On November 29, 1999, Magic 89.9 transferred its studios from PHILCOMCEN Building in Pasig City to the Paragon Plaza Building in Mandaluyong City to share facilities with sister stations 99.5 RT (now 99.5 Play FM) and 103.5 K-Lite, Mellow Touch 94.7 (now Mellow 947), DWBL 1242 and DWSS 1494. =2000s: Good Times and Boys Night Out popularity= Since its inception, the station started a trend on FM radio of making Fridays nostalgia days with the Friday Magic Madness program (now Friday Madness), that plays music from the 1980s hit music all day. On the other hand, weekend program Saturday Slam plays the 1990s music. Mo Twister, after four years in hiatus, returned to Magic 89.9, with Good Times With Mo (Limited Edition). He returned again in February 2006 with Good Times With Mo, along with Mojo Jojo, then a late night show. In June 2006, it was transferred to the morning slot (6-9 AM) with a third co-host, Andi. She, however resigned in February 2007, and was replaced by Maui Taylor. Maui retired on May 30, 2007, so Andi9 returned in June 2007, only to leave again in November 2007. The third co-host was Noelle Bonus. On July 17, 2007, The Magic website was in operation once more to serve the net surfing Magic 89.9 listeners here and especially abroad. Recent additions to the Magic list of programs include the American Top 40 (AT40) which is hosted by American Idol presenter and American radio and TV personality Ryan Seacrest, as well as BigFish Radio hosted by Johnboy Lee of BigFish Manila every Saturday nights which features exclusive programs by international club DJs such as Paul Van Dyk, David Guetta, Armin van Buuren and others. =2010s: The Magic's 30th Anniversary Celebration= In January 2014, Mo Twister returns on his morning show Good Times with his new co-host Sam Oh (from its previous timeslot First Thing in the Morning while Good Times was under a 5-month suspension) and Filipino-Canadian internet sensation Mikey Bustos. Friday Madness and Saturday Slam introduced their new and improved playlist, Friday Madness includes the early 90s music, while Saturday Slam includes the early 2000s music. On May 31, 2014, the station brought back its Saturday night club/party timeslot with the debut of Saturday Night Takeover mixed by the country's popular club/EDM DJs such as Ace Ramos, Mars Miranda, Marc Marasigan, Deuce Manila, Katsy Lee, Travis Monsod, Ron Poe among others. After 27 years of Lovenotes absence on the station, the said show returned on November 6, 2015 and it is the same timeslot as the way it is. On December 26, 2015, Saturday Slam aired the last program date. This was because they had to make way for the adjustment due to the fact that it will revert the Saturday schedule to its original schedule from the station's first broadcast until the very early 2000s. The Sunday schedule (then known as Super Hit Sunday, consists of mornings with the Junior Jocks to afternoons with selected weekend/fill-in DJs) was later merged with the regular Saturday schedule, which became Super Hit Weekend timeslot that plays the hits from 10 years before the current year up to the present. On February 28, 2016, The Magic celebrated its 30th anniversary into the airwaves, and a lot of major changes in the programming happened. The station brought back its usual Sunday night slow jam program Sunday Slowdown, after a decade of being replaced by another re-titled program Slow Flow, and later, Nothing Noisy. On the other hand, the station begins to change the timeframe of Friday Madness from the 1980s (original timeframe) to its two decades (the 1990s and the early 2000s) as the current timeframe for the program. In November the same year, the station held its 30th anniversary concert featuring OPM icons Ely Buendia and Rico Blanco at Eastwood City. In July 2017, Delamar Arias from Monster RX 93.1 joined the station, Andi Manzano also returned and co-host the weekly family-oriented program The Mother Show along with Rikiflo. As of 2018, Andrew Santiago is the current station manager.

It has been successfully used by the UK armed forces, with the Royal Air Force using 22 Slingsby T67M260s as their basic trainer between 1995 and 2010. Over 100,000 flight hours were flown out of RAF Barkston Heath by Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines students, who lived on camp at RAF Cranwell), and at RAF Church Fenton with RAF and foreign students were accommodated at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, bussed to and from the airfield daily. The Slingsby has also been used by the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force, the Royal Jordanian Air Force (still currently used), and other military training schools around the world for many years. Also, in December 2012, the National Flying Laboratory Centre at Cranfield University in the UK acquired a T67M260 to supplement its Scottish Aviation Bulldog aerobatic trainer for MSc student flight experience and training. The Slingsby is a very competent basic trainer and is still operated by many private individuals for standard-level aerobatics training. It was flown by Prince Harry as a basic trainer during his Army Air Corps flying training course, based at RAF Barkston Heath, including his first solo flight in Slingsby T67M260 registration G-BWXG in 2009. Tom Cassells a British Aerobatic Champion regularly flies his Slingsby Firefly. However, in the mid-1990s, the aircraft became controversial in the United States after three fatal accidents during US Air Force training operations, although an Air Force investigation eventually attributed the accidents primarily to pilot error. Development The RF-6 was designed by René Fournier, and first flew on 12 March 1974. An all-wooden construction, it featured a high aspect-ratio wing echoing his earlier motorglider designs. Fournier set up his own factory at Nitray to manufacture the design, but after only around 40 had been built, the exercise proved financially unviable, and he was forced to close down production. A four-seat version was under development by Sportavia as the RF-6C, but this demonstrated serious stability problems that eventually led to an almost complete redesign as the Sportavia RS-180. In 1981, Fournier sold the development rights of the RF-6B to Slingsby, which renamed it the T67. The earliest examples, the T67A, were virtually identical to the Fournier-built aircraft, but the design was soon revised to replace the wooden structure with one of composite material. Slingsby produced several versions developing the airframe and adding progressively larger engines. The Slingsby T67M, aimed at the military (hence \\"M\\") training market, was the first to include a constant- speed propeller and inverted fuel and oil systems. Over 250 aircraft have been built, mainly the T67M260 and closely related T-3A variants. Although operated successfully in the United Kingdom and Canada, the program would end in the United States because of a fatal crash following an engine failure. The type was meant to not only replace the Cessna T-41 introductory trainer, but also to meet the Enhanced Flight Screening Program (EFSP) requirements. The US Air Force has no replacement for this type, as it no longer provides training to non-fliers. The aircraft were eventually declared in excess of need in the early 2000s (decade) and disposed of by scrapping in 2006. Operational history The largest Firefly operator was the United States Air Force, where it was given the designation T-3A Firefly. The Firefly was selected in 1992 to replace the T-41 aircraft for the command's Enhanced Flight Screening Program, which would include aerobatic maneuvers. From 1993 to 1995, 113 aircraft were purchased and delivered to Hondo Municipal Airport in Texas, and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. The Commander of the Air Education and Training Command stood down the entire T-3A fleet in July 1997 as a result of uncommanded engine stoppages during flight and ground operations. A major factor driving the decision were the three T-3A Class A mishaps. Three Air Force Academy cadets and three instructors were killed in these T-3A mishaps. The Air Force Accident Investigation Board report summary attributed the three fatal accidents to: i. 22 February 1995: The instructor pilot (IP) failed to apply antispin rudder as directed in flight manual. The IP's spin academic instruction, flying training, and error analysis experience did not adequately prepare him to recognize his improper rudder application. ii. 30 September 1996: During a simulated forced landing, the engine quit for some unknown reason. After the engine quit, the aircraft entered a stall from which the IP was unable to recover prior to ground impact. iii. 25 June 1997: The aircraft departed controlled flight for an unknown reason during the turn to downwind. The IP's failure to recognize this departure and take immediate positive corrective action was the primary cause of the accident. (The AIB President found no clear and convincing evidence of mechanical failure.) In April 1995 a 3rd Flying Training Squadron lost a T-3A in a landing accident. During a planned student no-flap landing at Hondo Airfield, Hondo, Texas. At touchdown the student jerked the aircraft back into the air and the plane stalled. The instructor took the aircraft and applied full throttle but he couldn't prevent the crash. The aircraft touched down beside the runway and the nose gear struck the lip of a cross runway and collapsed causing loss of control and heavy damage. The only injury was a slight injury to the instructor's foot from the nose gear coming up through the cockpit floor. The mishap was classified as a Class B (non-hull loss) because it was said the aircraft could be repaired for less than $300,000 even though the Air Force chose to scrap the plane. The planes had been purchased for $32 million, and following the third accident, $10 million was spent on fixes to make them airworthy after grounding. \\"The Air Force found the cost of getting the aircraft or any of the aircraft's components in airworthy condition for resale was prohibitive\\" and \\"In September 1999, the chief of staff of the Air Force approved termination of the T-3A EFSP, and AETC declared all T-3A aircraft excess to the command's needs.\\" In 2000, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force requested a new mission be found for the T-3A; however, a study completed in 2002 did not recommend a follow-on mission. \\"The remaining T-3A aircraft were then stored without maintenance at the Air Force Academy and the Hondo Airport. In the 2002 to 2003 timeframe, the 53 aircraft at the Air Force Academy were disassembled, crated and trucked to Hondo.\\" On 9 September 2006, it was announced the remaining 53 (114 were originally purchased) disassembled T-3 aircraft, which had been declared in excess need for over six years, were scrapped. Edwards Air Force Base operated a single T67M Slingsby for test pilot training which originated from the fuel system flight tests in 1998 until it crashed in 2014 killing both occupants . Although the Air Force terminated the EFSP, it now uses the non-aerobatic Diamond DA20 for Initial Flight Screening through the third-party Doss Aviation.

The T67M has a fuel- injected Lycoming AEIO320-D1B and a two-blade Hoffman HO-V72L-V/180CB constant-speed propellor, single piece canopy, fuel in firewall tank. The fuel-injected engine with inverted fuel and oil systems allowed the aircraft to perform sustained negative-G (inverted) aerobatics, although inverted spins were never formally approved. A total of 32 T67Ms (including the later T67M MkII) were produced. ;T67B :First flown on 16 April 1981 and certified on 18 September 1984, the T67B was effectively the T67A made, like the T67M, in glassfibre reinforced plastic, but without the up-rated engine and propeller. O-235 118hp engine, 2 blade fixed prop, fuel in firewall tank, single piece canopy. A total of 14 T67Bs were produced. ;T67M MkII Firefly :Certified on 20 December 1985, AEIO-320 fuel injected 160hp engine, 2 blade constant speed prop, inverted fuel and oil systems. The T67M MkII replaced the single-piece canopy of the T67M with a two-piece design, and the single fuselage fuel tank with two, larger tanks in the wings. ;T67M200 Firefly :Certified on 19 June 1987, the T67M200 was had a more powerful Lycoming AEIO360-A1E with a three- bladed Hoffman propellor, inverted fuel and oil systems. A total of 26 T67M-200s were produced. T67C Firefly ;T67C Firefly :Certified on 15 December 1987, the T67C was the last of the \\"civilian\\" variants, based on the T67B with an uprated Lycoming O-320 engine, but without fuel injection and inverted- flight systems found on the T67M variants. Two blade constant speed prop. Two further sub-versions of the T67C copied the two-piece canopy (T67C-2) and wing tanks (T67C-3, sometimes known as the T67D) from the T67M MkII. A total of 28 T67Cs were produced across the three versions. ;T67M260 Firefly :Certified on 11 November 1993, the T67M260 added even more power from the six-cylinder, Lycoming AEIO540-D4A5 engine, three blade constant speed prop. Unusually for side-by-side light aircraft, the T67M260 was built to be flown solo from the right-hand seat to allow student pilots to immediately get used to the left- hand throttle found in most military aircraft – earlier models of the T67M had a second throttle on the left-hand sidewall of the cabin. A total of 51 T67M-260s were produced. They were used to successfully train hundreds of RAF, RN, British Army, and foreign and Commonwealth pilots through Joint Elementary Flying Training School until late 2010. ;T67M260-T3A Firefly :Certified on 15 December 1993, the last military version of the T67 family was the T67M260-T3A, of which the entire production run of 114 was purchased by the United States Air Force, where it was known as the T-3A. The T-3A was basically the T67M260 with the addition of air conditioning. Although the US media claimed the aircraft was to blame after four aircraft were destroyed in accidents, no engine stoppages or vapour-lock problems with the fuel system were found during very thorough tests at Edwards AFB. All three instructors killed in the accidents came from the C-141, a large-transport aircraft. Their only prior aerobatic experience was in Air Force pilot training in the T-37 and T-38 jet trainers. This, combined with thinner air at the higher density altitude of the Academy airfield and training areas, meant spin recovery was delayed and/or improper spin prevent/recovery techniques were used. Parachutes were not worn on the first fatal accident but were worn on the second and third fatal accidents. Both of these accidents were caused by low altitude spins. Following the three fatal accidents and an engine failure in the Academy landing pattern the fleet was grounded in 1997 and stored without maintenance until being destroyed in 2006. ;CT-111 Firefly :Designation by the Canadian Forces internally only as aircraft are registered as civilian aircraft Operators =Military operators= ; *Bahrain Air Force operates three T67M-260Hoyle Flight International 13–19 December 2011, p. 34. ; *Belize Defence Force Air Wing – 1 x T67M-260 ; *Royal Jordanian Air Force- 14 × T67M-260 ;: *Dutch pilot selection centre: The Firefly is used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force during pilot selection which is contracted out to TTC at Seppe Airport. =Former military operators= ; *Canadian Forces The Firefly was used as a basic military training aircraft in Canada.

The environments range from Alpine area on the higher mountains, sclerophyll forest, to woodland. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing, and is also burnt off by bushfires several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into vascular plants that include gymnosperms, flowering plants, and ferns; bryophytes, lichens, fungi, and freshwater algae. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Also several lichens are unique to the ACT, however as further study is undertaken they are likely to be found elsewhere too. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the Flora of Australia and include well known plants such as Grevillea, Eucalyptus trees and kangaroo grass. Vegetation habitats Grassland originally occurred on the low plains around north Canberra, Woolshed creek in Majura, Jerrabomberra Creek in Symonston, Gerrabomberra Creek in Belconnen, Tuggeranong Creek in Isabella Plains and Yarralumla Creek in Woden Valley. Almost all of these areas have been built over by suburbs, or modified by farming. The main plants from the grasslands were Stipa, Danthonia and Themeda (spear grass, wallaby grass and kangaroo grass). Trees do not exists on the grasslands due to the frost hollow effect where cold heavy air sinks on frosty mornings killing off larger vegetation. The remains of the grasslands are now full of introduced weeds and grasses. A small reserve of remnant grasslands is found at Yarramundi on the north side of Lake Burley Griffin. Most of the trees in the ACT are Eucalyptus species. Low altitude woodland is dominated by Eucalyptus melliodora (yellow box) and Eucalyptus polyanthemos (red box). E. blakelyi is found in lower lying areas. E. bridgesiana grows along creeks. In sandy soil near rivers Casuarina cunninghamiana is common. On the border between woodland and grassland Eucalyptus pauciflora (snow gum) and Eucalyptus rubida are the only trees growing. These trees can survive lower temperatures. High altitude woodland occupies the floor of the higher valleys in the south of the ACT. The trees are dominated by E. stellulata (black sally) and snowgums. On the ground above the woodland there is dry sclerophyll forest. The trees in this are Eucalyptus dives (broad leaved peppermint), E. mannifera var maculosaAustralian Plant Name Index (red spotted gum), the scribbly gum (Eucalyptus rossii) and red stringy gum (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha). Mount Majura, Mount Ainslie, Bullen Range, and Black Mountain are covered in this kind of forest. Dry sclerophyll forest also grows on the north and west side of hills, below 660 metres, which is warmer and drier. Gulleys in this kind of forest can contain Eucalyptus viminalis (manna gum) and Eucalyptus radiata var robertsoniiAustralian Plant Name Index entry (narrow leaved peppermint). Wet sclerophyll forest is found growing on the western mountainous parts of the ACT where rain fall is higher and the ground is more elevated. E. fastigata (brown barrel) and Eucalyptus delegatensis (alpine ash) dominate the forest. Dense shrubs up to five metres high form an understorey. Examples of these are Leptospermum lanigerum, Pomaderris aspera, Olearia argophylla, and Bedfordia salicina. The top side of this forest has Eucalyptus dalrympleana and E. pauciflora starting to take over. Alpine woodland is found in the highest levels of the ACT with E. pauciflora the dominant tree. This grows either thinly or in clumps, with the intervening ground feature Poa species. Flora of the Australian Capital Territory, Nancy T. Burbidge and Max Gray ANU Press Canberra 1979 Vascular plants found only in the ACT Kambah Karpet a variety of Acacia dealbata discovered at the Kambah Village Pomaderris pallida family Rhamnaceae. Found along Murrumbidgee, Cotter, Paddys and Molonglo Rivers. A round bush 1 to 2 metres high, creamish coloured flowers. Arachnorchis actensis (Canberra Spider-orchid). Lepidium ginninderrense (Ginninderra Peppercress). Found in the Northwest corner of the Belconnen Naval Transmission Station at Lawson Muehlenbeckia tuggeranong (Tuggeranong Lignum). The plant takes the form of a mound of tangled stems 1 m high and 2 m across. Found near Pine Island on the Murrumbidgee River but is extremely rare. Corunastylis ectopa (Brindabella Midge-orchid, Ectopic Midge-orchid). Gymnosperms Only two species of gymnosperms are native to the ACT. These are a shrub called Podocarpus lawrencei (mountain plum pine) and a small tree Callitris endlicheri (black cypress pine). The cypress grows in steep stony soil in places such as Molonglo Gorge, Murrumbidgee River valley and Ginninderra Gorge. Other gymnosperms are cultivated in the ACT such as Pinus radiata. Endemic Lichens of the ACT Australian Capital Territory has 384 known species of lichens of which 8 are endemic. Study continues on these life forms, so more will be discovered.

Scott (April 28, 1918 – January 2, 2005), also known as \\"Dick Scott\\", was an American politician, U.S. Air Force pilot, and the former Mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He is best known to have led the effort to bring professional baseball back to the city of Lancaster. This was realized with the creation of the Lancaster Barnstormers, of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He also served as Adjutant General of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1986. Biography Mural honoring Richard M. Scott at Lancaster's Clipper Magazine Stadium Dick Scott was born in the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to Roy V. and Laura Scott. He graduated from the Lancaster Boys' High School. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. Scott was stationed in England in January 1944 and began flying P-38 missions over Europe during World War II. In March 1944, Scott's plane clipped a transmission tower in the Netherlands, shearing off his left wing and forcing a crash landing in Nazi-occupied territory. Scott eluded capture for several months with the help of the Dutch resistance, with whom he joined for several months. The Dutch resistance conceived a plot to help Scott escape the Netherlands by traveling through occupied Belgium and France before arriving in neutral Switzerland. However, Nazi spies who had infiltrated the resistance learned of the plot and Scott was arrested by German authorities. Scott managed to escape from the Nazis twice during his detention. In 1945, he escaped for the second time from a prisoner of war camp in Sagan, Germany, and was able to rejoin the American forces. Upon reaching the Americans, Scott was nearly shot by them because they did not initially believe he was an escaped American prisoner of war. Scott retired from the United States Air Force in 1970. He was elected Mayor of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1973. He was re- elected in 1977. Under his leadership, Lancaster City was renewed with the Armstrong-National Central Bank and a lower crime rate. Albert Wohlsen was appointed interim mayor in 1979 after Scott resigned as mayor to serve as adjutant general of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1986 under former Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh. As Adjutant General, Scott led the Pennsylvania National Guard and the state's veterans programs. Scott died on January 2, 2005, at Reading Hospital in Reading, Pennsylvania at the age of 86. In 2006, Scott was posthumously inducted into the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs Hall of Fame.

Individuals view these stimuli in a neutral and open way or as a threat.BUDNER, S. (1962). Intolerance of ambiguity as a personality variable. Journal of Personality, 30(1), 29–50. History Ambiguity tolerance–intolerance is a construct that was first introduced in 1949 through the work of Else Frenkel-Brunswik while researching ethnocentrism in childrenRENKELBRUNSWIK, E. (1949). Intolerance of ambiguity as an emotional and perceptual personality variable. Journal of Personality, 18(1), 108–143. and was perpetuated by her research of ambiguity intolerance in connection to authoritarian personality.Adorno, T. W., Frenkel-Brunswik, E., Levinson, D. J., & Sanford, R. N. (1950). The authoritarian personality. New York. It serves to define and measure how well an individual responds when presented with an event that results in ambiguous stimuli or situations. In her study, she tested the notion that children who are ethnically prejudiced also tend to reject ambiguity more so than their peers. She studied children who ranked high and low on prejudice in a story recall test and then studied their responses to an ambiguous disc shaped figure. The children who scored high in prejudice were expected to take longer to give a response to the shape, less likely to make changes on their response, and less likely to change their perspectives. A study by Kenny and Ginsberg (1958) retesting Frenkel- Brunswik's original connection of ambiguity intolerance to ethnocentrism and authoritarian personality found that the results were unreplicable.Kenny, D. T., & Ginsberg, R. (1958). The specificity of intolerance of ambiguity measures. The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 56(3), 300–304. However, it was discussed that this may be due to the fact that at the time the study was done incorrect methodology was used and that there lacked a concrete definition as to what the construct was.BOCHNER, S. (1965). Defining intolerance of ambiguity. Psychological Record, 15(3), 393–400. Most of the research on this subject was completed in the two decades after the publication of \\"The Authoritarian Personality\\", however the construct is still studied in psychological research today. Budner gives three examples as to what could be considered ambiguous situations: a situation with no familiar cues, a situation in which there are many cues to be taken into consideration, and a situation in which cues suggest the existence of different structures to be adhered to. = Conceptualization = There have been many attempts to conceptualize the construct of ambiguity tolerance–intolerance as to give researchers a more standard concept to work with. Many of these conceptualizations are based on the work of Frenkel-Brunswik. Budner (1962) defines the construct as the following: :Intolerance of ambiguity may be defined as ‘the tendency to perceive (i.e. interpret) ambiguous situations as sources of threat’; tolerance of ambiguity as ‘the tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable.’ Additionally Bochner (1965) categorized attributes given by Frenkel-Brunswik’s theory of individuals who are intolerant to ambiguity. The nine primary characteristics describe intolerance of ambiguity and are as follows: #Need for categorization #Need for certainty #Inability to allow good and bad traits to exist in the same person #Acceptance of attitude statements representing a white-black view of life #A preference for familiar over unfamiliar #Rejection of the unusual or different #Resistance to reversal of fluctuating stimuli #Early selection and maintenance of one solution in an ambiguous situation #Premature closure The secondary characteristics describe individuals who are intolerant to ambiguity as: #authoritarian #dogmatic #rigid #closed minded #ethnically prejudiced #uncreative #anxious #extra-punitive #aggressive Operationalization and measurement *Because of the lack of concrete conceptualization of what ambiguity intolerance is, there are a variety of ways in which to measure the construct. For example, Stanley Budner developed a scale with 16 items designed to measure how subjects would respond to an ambiguous situation. *Block and Block (1951) operationalized the construct by measuring the amount of time required to structure an ambiguous situation. The less amount of time required to structure, the higher a person would score in ambiguity intolerance.LOCK, J., & BLOCK, J. (1951). An investigation of the relationship between intolerance of ambiguity and ethnocentrism. Journal of Personality, 19(3), 303–311. *Levitt (1953) studied intolerance of ambiguity in children and asserted that the Decision Location Test and Misconception Scale both served as accurate measures of ambiguity intolerance.evitt, E. E. (1953). Studies in intolerance of ambiguity: I. the decision-location test with grade school children. Child Development, 24, 263–268. Psychological implications The construct of Ambiguity Intolerance is found in different aspects of psychology and mental health. The construct is used in many branches of psychology including personality, developmental, and social psychology. Some examples of how tolerance–intolerance of ambiguity is used within various branches are displayed below. =Personality psychology= The construct of ambiguity intolerance was conceptualized in the study of personality. While the original theory of ambiguity intolerance being positively correlated to authoritarian personalities has come under fire, the construct is still used in this branch. A study was done testing college students' tolerance for ambiguityTatzel, M. (1980). Tolerance for ambiguity in adult college students. Psychological Reports, 47(2), 377–378 and found that students who were involved in the arts had higher scores than business students on ambiguity tolerance, from which the assertion that creativity is linked to the construct. =Developmental psychology= Harington, Block, and Block (1978) assessed intolerance of ambiguity in children at an early age, ranging from 3.5–4.5 years. The children were assessed using two tests performed by caretakers in a daycare center. The researchers then re-evaluated the children when they turned seven, and their data showed that male students who were high in ambiguity intolerance at the early age had more anxiety, required more structure, and had less effective cognitive structure than their female peers who had also tested high in ambiguity intolerance.HARRINGTON, D., BLOCK, J., & BLOCK, J. (1978). Intolerance of ambiguity in preschool-children – psychometric considerations, behavioral manifestations, and parental correlates. Developmental Psychology, 14(3), 242–256. =Social psychology= Being intolerant to ambiguity can affect how an individual perceives others with whom they come into contact. Social psychology uses ambiguity tolerance–intolerance to study these relationships and the relationship one holds with themselves. Research has been conducted on how ambiguity tolerance–intolerance interacts with racial identity,Sanchez, D. T., Shih, M., & Garcia, J. A. (2009). Juggling multiple racial identities: Malleable racial identification and psychological well-being. Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 15(3), 243–254. homophobia,Perez, J. (2002).

The contribution of the preterm labor stress and family resiliency factors to pregnancy adjustment and adaptation in the preterm labor family. (Order No. AAI9952322), Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5435 =Mental health= Research shows that being too far on either end of the spectrum of ambiguity tolerance–intolerance can be detrimental to mental health. Ambiguity intolerance is thought to serve as a cognitive vulnerability that can lead, in conjunction with stressful life events and negative rumination, to depression. Anderson and Schwartz hypothesize that this is because ambiguity intolerant individuals tend to see the world as concrete and unchanging, and when an event occurs which disrupts this view these individuals struggle with the ambiguity of their future. Therefore, those who are intolerant to ambiguity begin to have negative cognitions about their respective situation, and soon view these cognitions as a certainty. This certainty can serve as a predictive measure of depression.Andersen, S. M., & Schwartz, A. H. (1992). Intolerance of ambiguity and depression: A cognitive vulnerability factor linked to hopelessness. Social Cognition, 10(3), 271–298.

Although he started his professional career as a hooker, he usually played as prop. During his career he was part of the Blue Bulls provincial team in the Currie Cup (South Africa's premier domestic rugby union competition) and the Bulls franchise in the Super 14 competition. Provincial Bands made his provincial debut in 1994. After a break of several years he resumed his career 2001 when he joined Blue Bulls. He was part of Currie Cup winning teams from 2002 to 2004. After that numerous injuries prevented him from playing on the highest level. He retired from 1st class rugby by the end of the Super 14 season in 2008. Super Rugby It was in 2002 that Bands made his Super rugby debut, in a match for the Bulls against New Zealand team, the Chiefs. He continued playing for the Bulls until 2005. During his Super Rugby career he scored several tries, an unusual feature for a prop. International In 2003 he made his test debut for the Springboks against Scotland. During the 2003 Tri Nations Series match in Dunedin against the All Blacks he scored his famous try when he started his charge from the half-way line and effortlessly brushed away Carlos Spencer on his way to the try line. Grant Nesbitt's commentary of the try is one of the most popular phrases used when describing a try: \\"He's gonna have a go at Spencer! Get outta the road! That's one of the best tries you'll ever see from a prop forward, superb!\\" Later this season he played in four matches for the Springboks in the 2003 Rugby World Cup held in Australia. He scored a try in the win over Uruguay in South Africa's opening pool match. Altogether he played for the Springboks eleven times. Legal dispute with SA Rugby In 2008 the Johannesburg Labour Court ended the protracted legal conflict between SA Rugby and players Victor Matfield, Richard Bands and Christo Bezuidenhout, which started in 2004, when the CCMA awarded the three players compensation for loss of earnings, when their fixed-term contracts were not renewed despite their strong performances in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Former Springbok coach Rudolf Straeuli promised the three Springboks contracts before he was sacked. The Labour Court ruled that Straeuli's promise that the players were part of his future plans was not enough to create a reasonable expectation.

Biography Kimbangu was born at Nkamba, near Thysville, in 1887. The son of a traditional religious leader, he became a Baptist in 1915, and worked as a catechist for several years before beginning his own ministry in early 1921. According to his disciples, Kimbangu cured the sick, raised the dead back to life, prophesied the future and, the liberation of black people and many more greater miracles, his ministry developed a large following, causing suspicion amongst the Belgian authorities. His ministry of preaching and miraculous healing lasted from April to September 1921. Within a short time he attracted large crowds. According to Dr. Bertram Melbourne, both the Protestant and the Catholic religious establishments became alarmed and appealed to the colonial authorities who sought his arrest.Dr. Bertram Melbourne, Acts 1:8 and the Gospel in Africa in \\"2000 Years of Christianity in Africa\\", edited by Dr. Emory Tolbert, published by The Sabbath in Africa Study Group. David van Reybrouck, however, indicated that the Belgian administrator, Léon Morel, became concerned and invited Catholic and Protestant missionaries to a meeting in Thysville. While the Catholics supported a vigorous intervention, the Protestants favored a soft approach as they saw it as a form of Christian devotion. The hardliners prevailed and Kimbangu and followers were arrested on 6 June 1921, but Kimbangu escaped with some of his disciples and his son, Charles, into the bush. His ministry continued in hiding, but in September he turned himself in. He was placed before a military court, without the benefit of a legal representative, and found guilty of undermining public security and disturbing the peace. On 3 October 1921 he was sentenced to death. King Albert commuted his sentence to life imprisonment with and 120 lashes a day. He was moved to the prison in Elisabethville where he died on 12 October 1951. During his thirty years of imprisonment, he continued to be regarded as a spiritual leader and people claimed to see him appear at many places at the same time, continuesly being in contact with his followers and family by appearing to them, and giving them missions, and also became a symbol of Congolese nationalism. Before dying Kimbangu prophesied the day and time of his death. The Kimbanguist Church After Simon Kimbangu's trial the administration tried to suppress the movement. Followers were banished to different parts of the country and their faith was outlawed. In 1940 the highest ranking exiles were placed in guarded work camps and subjected to forced labor; many died. However, as a result of the persecution the Church spread in the underground and reached people in other areas. Eventually, in 1959, the Kimbanguist Church was recognized by the Belgian government and could then conduct prayer freely. Today, the Kimbanguist Church is well established in many countries. When Kimbangu died, his son Joseph Diangienda took over the Church ministry. Joseph Diangienda (chief spiritual) organized the contemporary Church. Diangienda (born 22 March 1918) died on 8 July 1992 in Switzerland and papa Salomon Dialungana Kiangani son, Simon Kimbangu Kiangani, is the spiritual leader based at the Church's headquarters in Nkamba.

She named Nkosi Ntsikayezwe Sigcau's daughter Princess Stella Sigcau II (Founder: Lwandlolubomvu Rural Development Project) after her. Sigcau graduated from the Loveday Institute in 1954 before marrying Ronald Tshabalala in 1962. She went on to attend the University of Fort Hare. There she joined the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL), then graduating with a BA degree majoring in Anthropology and Psychology.

Prior to the granting of independence, she held a number of portfolios, including energy, education and telecommunications. She was the only woman in the Transkei's cabinet. Sigcau had a frosty relationship with Prime Minister Kaiser Matanzima. Her political ideologies and associations with the ANC Youth League in Fort Hare where in direct opposition to Matanzima's. This she believed was the reason why she found it difficult to secure a post as a teacher in the Eastern Cape,Timothy Gibbs. \\"The Second Peasant's Revolt, Mpondoland 1960 - 1980\\".

Even though Sigcau was a part of the Transkei administration, she still maintained links with the ANC, who were operating from Lusaka at the time. Her father Botha Sigcau was king of the Mpondo people, who had influence within the Transkei State. A battle for power ensued between the Mpondo chieftaincy and Matanzima's Transkei government.Timothy Gibbs. \\"The Second Peasant's Revolt, Mpondoland 1960 - 1980\\". Boydell and Brewer LTD, pg 66. Accessed: 31st September 2018 In 1977 she gave birth to her third child after having an affair with Chief JD Moshesh, who was also a government official. Shortly thereafter her father Botha Sigcau died from a long illness. After King Sigcau's death Matanzima was looking to consolidate his authority over the Mpondo people, and he forced Sigcau out of office. Matanzima cited Sigcau and Chief JD Moshesh's affair as a breach of code of conduct for the reasons to recall her from public office. This was met with mixed reactions, given that she was also a widowed princess at the time. After the opening of parliament in 1978 Sigcau led a floor crossing of all Pondoland MPs, and formed the Democratic Progressive Party, but two years later she re-joined the Transkei National Independence Party, which was still the ruling party at the time. After independence, she held the portfolios of Interior Affairs and Posts and Telecommunications. She became the leader of the Transkei National Independence Party on 5 October 1987 and became the third Prime Minister of Transkei two days later. Then Prime Minister and brother to Kaiser Matanzima, George Matanzima was forced to resign from office due to corruption allegations. She defeated Kholisilie Nota and Ngangomhlaba Matanzima to the position, both of whom were male. Her term as Prime Minister did not last long as she was overthrown in a coup by General Bantu Holomisa. This came after Holomisa accused her government of corruption, alleging that Sigcau received bribes in exchange for gambling rights. While she denied these allegations, she conceded to accepting a bursary worth R50 000 from an official in order to pay for her daughter's tuition. South African politics Transkei was absorbed back into South Africa after 27 April 1994. Sigcau stood for election as a candidate on the African National Congress party list and was successful. President Nelson Mandela appointed her as Minister for Public Enterprises in 1994 and she served in that role, which involved attempts at transforming the face of South African Airways and Transnet until 1999. She then became Minister of Public Works and served in that capacity until her death in 2006 of heart failure.

Produced by Walt Disney Productions, the film was based on a 1938 novel by Gladys Bronwyn Stern. It was one of several light-hearted comedies produced by the Disney Studios during the 1960s. Plot Fran Garrison (Suzanne Pleshette) and her husband Mark (Dean Jones) are a young happily married couple and the proud owners of an award-winning Dachshund named Danke. The movie begins with them frantically getting into the car and heading to the hospital as \\"the pain has started and it's about time\\". In a hurry to the hospital, Officer Carmody tries to pull them over for going 50 mph in a 25 mph zone. After notifying that they are on the way to the hospital and indicating that Fran is the one in labor, Officer Carmody pulls in front of them and turns on the sirens to escort them to the county hospital. After he arrives and turns to find that Mr. and Mrs. Garrison have gone past him, he gets back on his motorcycle and follows them to the vet. It is then revealed that Danke is the one in labor. While Mark is outside waiting for Fran, Officer Carmody catches up to him and after Mark thanks him for helping them get to the vet on time, Officer Carmody reveals that he was under the impression that Mrs. Garrison was the one in labor and proceeds to write multiple traffic violation tickets totaling to $110. On the day that Mr. Garrison arrives at the vet to pick up Danke and her three female puppies: Wilhelmina, Heidi, and Chloe, veterinarian Dr. Pruitt (Charlie Ruggles) mentions that his female Great Dane, Duchess, has also given birth, but pushed away one of her male puppies because she didn't have enough milk for him. Doc Pruitt convinces Mark to bring the Great Dane puppy home, because Danke had too much milk, and she could save his life. When he arrives home and Fran notices that there is another puppy, she is surprised but does not suspect that the puppy is from another litter and reminds Mark that he should thank Danke for giving him a boy like he always wanted. He eventually tells Fran the truth about the male puppy and named him Brutus. As he grows up with Fran's Dachshund puppies, he believes he is one of them and picks up mannerisms like hunching close to the ground to walk. The Dachshunds are mischievous creatures and lead poor unsuspecting Brutus through a series of comic misadventures with Officer Carmody (now Sergeant Carmody) being chased up a tree, Mark's studio being splattered with paint, and a garden party being turned topsy-turvy. Fran wants Mark to remove Brutus from the house once-and- for-all but when Brutus saves her favorite puppy, Chloe, from the garbage truck, she changes her mind. Mark and Fran enter their dogs in a dog show with Brutus meeting others of his breed. He notices a female Harlequin Great Dane and stands at attention. He goes on to win two blue ribbons. Brutus finally finds out what it's like to be a Great Dane, especially making the Dachshunds respect him.

The method of election was the single transferable vote form of proportional representation (PR-STV).  History and boundaries  Covering all or part of County Kildare, the constituency existed for two distinct periods: from 1923 to 1937, and from 1948 to 1997. From 1923–1937 Kildare elected 3 deputies (Teachtaí Dála, commonly known as TDs), until it was absorbed into a new Carlow–Kildare constituency in 1937. After its re- establishment in 1948 it initially elected 3 TDs. This was increased to 4 seats in 1961, reduced again to 3 in 1969, and increased to 5 from 1981 until its abolition in 1997. Its boundaries were significantly revised on several occasions. The constituency was abolished for the 1997 general election, when it was replaced by two new constituencies: Kildare North and Kildare South.

Starting at the intersection with Princes Highway in Clayton, the road travels in a southerly direction, intersecting with Centre Road, an overpass of the Cranbourne and Pakenham railway lines and an intersection with Heatherton Road, all with a speed limit of 80 km/h. Westall Road then continues on as a semi-freeway standard road along the reservation of the Dingley Freeway with a speed limit of 80 km/h (formerly 100km/h until the Dingley Bypass was built). It continues as the Dandenong Bypass at Springvale Road and continues east to Cranbourne and Gippsland. History Historically before the reconstruction and extension works, Westall Road ran as a semi-major road from just south of the Dandenong Rail line at Westall Station to Heatherton Road, and as a minor road from the railway line to Centre Road. The previous thoroughfare consisted of taking McNaughton Road, Kombi Road and Rayhur Street. The extensions north to Princes Highway and south to Springvale Road were designed to reduce traffic which travels through Springvale via Springvale Road, as it has a 70 km/h speed limit for most of its length in which it is bypassed as well as having a reduced 60 km/h limit through the Springvale shopping area with this dropping to 40 km/h during school times. Traffic is further delayed by the level crossing adjacent to Springvale Station, and the particularly slow Springvale Junction. The upgrade of Westall Road has allowed north-south through traffic to avoid this area. Westall Road Southern Extension The Westall Road Extension runs along the Dingley Arterial route from Heatherton Road to Springvale Road in Springvale South. It commenced construction in 1994 and was finished in 1995. The extension is also known as the Springvale Bypass. The works involved creating a 2.8 km divided four lane (two lanes each way) semi- freeway standard road to bypass the busy and congested centre of Springvale. The extension involves constructing part of the Dingley Freeway to the future site of an interchange with Westall Road before travelling along a temporary alignment to join up with the extended Westall Road south of Heatherton Road. A speed limit of 100 km/h applied between Heatherton Road and Rowan Road from 1995 until 2015 when it was permanently changed to 80km/h as a result of the Dingley Bypass construction. The reason being VicRoads determined the stretch of road too short to have a limit of 100km/h. The limit had always been an 80 km/h limit on the approaches to Heatherton and Springvale Roads. A bicycle path was completed along the entire length of the road. As a result of the Dingley Bypass, there is now a T-intersection in place close to Heatherton Road connecting both the bypass & Westall Road. Original plans were for a grade separation at this intersection. Associated works included a northern extension of Westall Road from Rayhur Street, Springvale to Princes Highway in Clayton. Westall Road from Heatherton Road to Centre Road consisted of a two lane undivided road while the road from Centre Road to the Princes Highway was constructed as a six lane divided road. In order to enable Westall Road to truly serve as a high capacity alternative route to Springvale Road, the level crossing with the Cranbourne / Pakenham railway line was grade separated in conjunction with duplication works to upgrade Westall Road to a six lane divided road between Heatherton Road and Centre Road. These works were completed by April 2001.VicRoads - Road Safety Management Page 5 Major intersections See also References Category:Highways and freeways in Melbourne ","title":"Westall Road"},{"id":"5060272","text":"Petrus Fourie du Preez (; born 24 March 1982) is a South African former professional rugby union player.

The suburb falls within the West Ecclesfield ward of the city. History The Angel, Main Street, Grenoside The name Grenoside is derived from the language of the Anglo-Saxons. The name Grenoside, which was first recorded in the thirteenth century as Gravenhou, is made up of the different elements. Gren from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) graefan meaning a quarry. ‘o’ from the Old Norse haugr meaning hill and the modern word side, altogether meaning a quarried hillside.A History of Ecclesfield Parish(Compiled by Joan & Mel Jones of Chapeltown & High Green Archive) In Norman and later documents it is named as Gravenho (1199) and Gravenhowe (1332). This name is made from the Saxon word elements of Grave meaning \\"to dig\\" and How meaning Hollow. In this sense the meaning of Gravenhowe would be \\"Quarried Hollows\\" or \\"Quarried Hills\\" and indicates that stone has been quarried in Grenoside from the ninth century up to 1938 when the last quarry on Norfolk Hill closed. Other spellings of the name are Granenhou (1267), Granow (1450), Graynau (1534), Grenoside (1759), Greenaside (1772) and Grinaside (1831). Stone quarrying was a major industry in Grenoside from a very early date until it ceased in 1939. The stone quarried in Grenoside varied in quality and was put to several uses. The finer grained, hard stones were much in demand as grindstones for the cutlery trade and for fine fettling and finishing in iron foundries. Coarse grained stone was used for furnace lining and from these were hewn the stone boxes used in the Cementation process of steelmaking. In 1860 the following are named as quarry owners in Grenoside - Thomas Beever, George Broadhead, George Firth, Thomas Lint, Joseph Swift and Charles Uttley. By the beginning of the seventeenth century several village people were named in connection with the making of cutlery. William Smith, a yeoman of Grenoside, who died \\"of great age\\" in 1627 had taken out a cutlers mark in 1614. His son, Henry, was a member of the Cutler's Company in 1629. The manufacture of cutlery was restricted to those who had served an apprenticeship in the trade; an apprentice served seven or ten years without pay. The restriction was closely controlled by the Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire from 1624. As a result, many small nailmaking businesses were set up which was not so tightly controlled. As late as 1860, three nailmakers are listed as living and working in Grenoside. Grenoside Sword Dance The Grenoside Sword Dance forms an important mid-winter ritual for the village and can be traced back to the 1750s It is traditionally performed on Boxing Day morning in Main Street. There is an Anglican church situated on Main Street, St Mark's Church, Grenoside, a Methodist church on Norfolk Hill and St Thomas More Catholic Primary School, on Creswick Lane. The Primary School, originally on the north side of Norfolk Hill, recently relocated to a new building to the south of the road. The former infant building is semi-derelict. Grenoside's new crematorium, built in 1999 on Skew Hill Lane, was formerly a munitions scrap yard. Part of Greno Woods is a nature reserve managed by The Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham.

He was born in Berlin, Germany and has lived there his entire life. He is best known for his horror films Nekromantik (1987), Der Todesking (1990), Nekromantik 2 (1991) and Schramm (1993). In 1999, he directed an episode of the television series Lexx, after a six-year absence from the entertainment industry. In 2013, Buttgereit announced that he would be teaming up with fellow horror directors Andreas Marschall and Michal Kosakowski to work on an anthology film called German Angst, in which each director would do one short. The film was released on May 7, 2015. Buttgereit's superhero character, Captain Berlin, was adapted into a comic book series in 2013. There is currently a comic book version of Nekromantik being made. Early life Buttgereit was raised in West Berlin while the Berlin Wall was still standing and the Allied Forces; Britain, France and America, each controlled a section of the Federal Republic of Germany. Hence, young Buttgereit went to the movie theaters to watch films from the aforementioned countries, he particularly enjoyed watching monster movies from the age of four. His grandmother bought him packs of Creature Feature bubblegum cards while he was in kindergarten and for his first Holy communion he received a Super 8 camera. Buttgereit has been experimenting with film since 1977. His first project was called Gags und Schwarzer Humor, a parody of TV commercials. Color Trip was created after his camera broke and the developers gave him back black, blank film. After scratching and washing the film, something blue, black and green came out of the projector. Klassenfahrt was a movie about his class in his last year at school. Stress was another version of Color Trip using another returned blank film. He claims his very first feature was called Interview with Frankenstein. The Exploding Sports Shoe (1980) was a two-minute film consisting of a sport shoe exploding in slow-motion. It was shown on TV as part of a documentary about punk rock, the original title was 'The Most Beautiful Destruction'. In 2012, speaking at the Leeds International Film Festival, Buttgereit said that he was happy working in stage and television production and cited internet piracy as a problem for low-budget filmmakers.

As a producer he has been Oscar-nominated for The Crying Game (1992), and has also produced multi-Academy Award nominated films including Mona Lisa (1986), Little Voice (1998), Michael Collins (1996), The End of the Affair (1999), Interview with a Vampire (1994), and Carol (2016). He currently runs the production company Number 9 Films with his partner Elizabeth Karlsen. Career Woolley's first film as a producer was The Company of Wolves (1984), but his career began earlier in 1976 as an usher at London's art-house cinema The Screen on the Green in Islington, run by Romaine Hart (OBE). He then joined the exhibition arm of film collective The Other Cinema in Charlotte Street in the West End of London, before going on to own and run his own repertory cinema, The Scala Cinema, on the same premises. In 1981 it relocated to near King's Cross railway station. At the same time he established Palace Video in partnership with Nik Powell, in the early 1980s to distribute the types of cult cinema and international art films that had been the core of his cinema programmes. Palace Video titles included David Lynch’s Eraserhead (1977), Derek Jarman’s The Tempest (1979), and Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo (1982). It later grew into a theatrical distribution company, retitled Palace Pictures, where Woolley was behind the UK releases of French cult film Diva (1981), Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead (1981), Nagisa Ōshima’s Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Wim Wenders’ Paris, Texas (1984), the Coen brothers' Blood Simple (1984), Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally (1988) – as well as films by John Cassavetes, John Waters, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Peter Greenaway, Fassbinder, and Bertolucci. Palace Pictures moved into film production in 1984 with its first feature The Company of Wolves – directed by Neil Jordan (the first of many films Woolley and Jordan would later make together). Many of Palace Pictures projects were first supported by Channel 4, and Woolley also helped establish many first-time directors including Michael Caton-Jones and Richard Stanley. Woolley established an association with Miramax, which distributed a number of Palace films in the United States, including Scandal (1989), A Rage in Harlem (1991), Hardware (1990) and The Crying Game (1992). Woolley had established his reputation with a series of low budget but high production value releases, but began developing more ambitious projects. After some box-office disappointments and the recession which weakened Nik Powell's parent company in 1992 Palace Pictures was forced to close. A year later, The Scala Cinema's twelve-year lease expired simultaneously as its defeat in a court case caused by an illegal screening of A Clockwork Orange, whose screening rights had been withdrawn in the UK by Stanley Kubrick in 1971, and the financial collapse of Palace precipitated its closure in 1993. Woolley and Powell went on to found Scala Pictures, where they made Backbeat (1994), Little Voice (1998), Twenty Four Seven (1997), and a series of low budget UK features. Simultaneously, he secured a three-picture deal with Warner Brothers and made three films with Jordan after the worldwide box office hit of Interview with the Vampire. Woolley and Jordan formed a company, Company of Wolves funded by DreamWorks, where In Dreams (1999), The Actors (2003), Intermission (2003), and Not I (2000) were produced under this banner. Number 9 films was set up in 2002, with longstanding producing partner Elizabeth Karlsen, whose films include Breakfast on Pluto (2005), How to Lose Friends and Alienate People (2008), Made in Dagenham (2010), Great Expectations (2012), Their Finest (2015) The Limehouse Golem (2016), and On Chesil Beach (2017). Woolley's directorial debut, the 2005 film Stoned, was a biopic of Brian Jones. Personal life Woolley is married to fellow film producer Elizabeth Karlsen, with whom he co-founded Number 9 Films in 2002.

It stars Jeremy Renner as Jeffrey Dahmer, a serial killer in Wisconsin. There are two timelines in the film. The \\"present\\" runs in ordinary chronological order covering the period of one-to-two days; the flashbacks are in reverse order, as Dahmer is seen as successively younger until the film arrives at his first murder and the aftermath. Plot Jeffrey Dahmer is a shy and socially awkward man in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Troubled by a turbulent childhood and his religious father's denial of his homosexuality, Dahmer lures attractive young men at home, where he conducts experiments and kills them, trying to create a living zombie who will never leave or judge him. Flashback to Dahmer's past revealed that he killed his first victim, a hitchhiker he picked up in his hometown of Bath, Ohio, when he was a teenager. The flashbacks also reveal his troubled relationship with his father and Jeffrey's alcoholism. In the present, he rationalizes his crimes in Milwaukee over the divorce of his parents and his emotionally isolated childhood. Dahmer keeps inviting men home from bars and clubs, then he rapes and kills them. Jeffrey invites a young man named Rodney, intended to murder him, but as the night goes on and the conversations get more personal, Jeffrey is faced with an emotional crisis. Rodney confesses his romantic feelings for Jeffrey, but finds him evasive. During the course of their evening together, Jeffrey nearly strangles Rodney with a belt, but Rodney escapes from the apartment. The film ends with a flashback to Jeffrey as a teenager, going to a therapy session at his father's behest; when he arrives at the therapist's office, however, he turns away from the door and walks off into the woods. A title card then explains that Dahmer was found guilty of murdering 17 men, and killed in prison. Cast :The real-life counterpart to the fictional victim is in parentheses Production The film was promoted using the longer title \\"Dahmer: The Mind is a Place of its Own\\" but shortened to Dahmer in most cases. Although the script recreates actual events, the names are changed out of respect for Dahmer's victims. In reality, the escapee who led to Dahmer's capture was Tracy Edwards, portrayed by Artel Kayàru as Rodney, and Dahmer's first victim was Stephen Hicks, portrayed in the film by Matt Newton as Lance Bell. Production took place in Los Angeles, with one scene in Milwaukee. The mask special effects were created by Christien Tinsley and Kelley Mitchell, who were involved two years later in the makeup for Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Reception =Box office= Dahmer began a limited release in the United States on June 21, 2002, opening in two theaters and grossing $16,093 during its first weekend. The film later expanded its release to five theaters, and remained in theatrical distribution for 27 weeks. By the conclusion of its run, it had grossed a total of $144,008 domestically. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on reviews from 39 critics. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 63 out of 100, based on reviews from 18 critics. Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film a mixed review, praising Renner's performance and the supporting roles, but saying the film \\"falls headlong into the trap of imagining that it can somehow rationalize the monstrous.\\" Robert Koehler of Variety wrote: \\"Jacobson produces a remarkably creepy piece of cinema that disturbs by suggestion, nuance and ambiguity.\\" Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a middling review, writing, \\"Filmmaker David Jacobson doesn't seem to know where to go with his version. He approaches crass exploitation by juxtaposing scenes of carnage with shots of chocolate spilling into a vat (Dahmer worked in a candy factory). Other moments carry real suspense and emotional weight.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Renner's performance, stating that he \\"imbues Jeffrey Dahmer with a very solemn desolation that looks just enough like \\"normal\\" pain to let you in on the way that this repressed, lonely freak could pass himself off as just another sad-eyed outcast.\\" Shawn Levy of The Oregonian gave the film a positive review, noting, \\"Writer-director David Jacobson and his star, Jeremy Renner, have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted.\\" =Accolades= At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards it received nominations for Best Male Lead for Jeremy Renner, Best Newcomer for Artel Kayàru, and John Cassavetes Award for David Jacobson. Legacy Kathryn Bigelow said that she cast Renner in The Hurt Locker because of his performance in Dahmer.

Early life John Willcock was born at Frogmoor (now Frogmore), New South Wales on 9 August 1879. The son of miner Joseph Willcock, he was educated at Sydney Boys High School, before emigrating to Western Australia in 1897. He was employed on the Fremantle Harbour Works until 1899, then spent two years as an engine driver or cleaner for Western Australian Government Railways. In 1902 he moved to Geraldton, where he worked as a railway fireman until 1912. In 1907 he married Sicily Ann Stone, with whom he would have three sons and three daughters. From 1912 to 1917 he worked as an engine driver. Political career Willcock became an active and enthusiastic member of the Labor Party (ALP), holding various offices in the Geraldton branch of the Engine Drivers', Firemen's and Cleaners' Union, and representing them at Federal conferences. From 1914 to 1917 he was President of the Geraldton District Council of the ALP, and he was a Justice of the Peace from 1915. On 14 April 1917 he contested the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Geraldton in a by-election occasioned by the resignation of Ernest Heitmann, but was defeated by Samuel Elliott. Five months later he won the seat in the general election of 29 September 1917. He was soon made a member of the executive of the Australian Workers' Union, and became secretary of the Parliamentary Labor Party. On 16 April 1924, Willcock was appointed Minister for Railways and Justice and Minister for Police in the Collier ministry. He held the Police portfolio until 25 June 1928, and the Railways and Justice portfolio until the defeat of the Collier government on 23 April 1930. From 1927 to 1930 he was deputy leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party. When the Labor party returned to power under Collier on 24 April 1933, Willcock resumed as Minister for Railways and Justice, and was also given the Education portfolio. He relinquished the Education portfolio on 26 March 1935, when he was reappointed deputy leader. On 19 August the following year, Collier stepped down as premier and leader of the Labor Party, and the following day Willcock was appointed his successor. Relinquishing the Railways and Justice portfolio, he took the offices of Premier, Treasurer and Minister for Forests. He dropped the Forests portfolio on 9 December 1943, but held the other offices for nearly nine years, resigning for reasons of ill health on 31 July 1945. During his time as Premier of Western Australia, Willcock represented Western Australia at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937. He was known for his \\"disarming modesty\\". After resigning as premier, Willcock retired to the backbenches until the general election of 15 March 1947, at which he did not re-contest his seat. He died on 7 June 1956 at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco, Western Australia, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. John Willcock College (opened as John Willcock Senior High School), established in Geraldton in 1975, is named after Willcock.

Introduction In simple terms, a computer is modeled as a machine with inputs and outputs. Inputs and outputs are classified as either low (low sensitivity, not highly classified) or high (sensitive, not to be viewed by uncleared individuals). A computer has the non-interference property if and only if any sequence of low inputs will produce the same low outputs, regardless of what the high level inputs are. That is, if a low (uncleared) user is working on the machine, it will respond in exactly the same manner (on the low outputs) whether or not a high (cleared) user is working with sensitive data. The low user will not be able to acquire any information about the activities (if any) of the high user. Formal expression Let M be a memory configuration, and let M_L and M_H be the projection of the memory M to the low and high parts, respectively. Let {=_L} be the function that compares the low parts of the memory configurations, i.e., M\\\\ {=_L}\\\\ M^\\\\prime iff M_{L} = M_{L}^\\\\prime. Let (P,M) \\\\rightarrow^* M^\\\\prime be the execution of the program P starting with memory configuration M and terminating with the memory configuration M^\\\\prime. The definition of non-interference for a deterministic program P is the following:Smith, Geoffrey (2007). \\"Principles of Secure Information Flow Analysis\\". Advances in Information Security. 27. Springer US. pp. 291-307. \\\\begin{array}{rrl}\\\\forall M_1, M_2 :\\\\; & M_1\\\\ {=_L}\\\\ M_2 & \\\\land\\\\\\\\\\\\ & (P,M_1) \\\\rightarrow^* M_1^\\\\prime & \\\\land\\\\\\\\\\\\ &(P,M_2) \\\\rightarrow^* M_2^\\\\prime &\\\\Rightarrow\\\\\\\\\\\\ &M;_1^\\\\prime\\\\ {=_L}\\\\ M_2^\\\\prime\\\\end{array} Limitations =Strictness= This is a very strict policy, in that a computer system with covert channels may comply with, say, the Bell–LaPadula model, but will not comply with non-interference. The reverse could be true (under reasonable conditions, being that the system should have labelled files, etc.) except for the \\"No classified information at startup\\" exceptions noted below. However, non-interference has been shown to be stronger than non- deducibility. This strictness comes with a price. It is very difficult to make a computer system with this property. There may be only one or two commercially available products that have been verified to comply with this policy, and these would essentially be as simple as switches and one-way information filters (although these could be arranged to provide useful behaviour). =No classified information at startup= If the computer has (at time=0) any high (i.e., classified) information within it, or low users create high information subsequent to time=0 (so-called \\"write-up,\\" which is allowed by many computer security policies), then the computer can legally leak all that high information to the low user, and can still be said to comply with the non-interference policy. The low user will not be able to learn anything about high user activities, but can learn about any high information that was created through means other than the actions of high users.(von Oheimb 2004) Computer systems that comply with the Bell-LaPadula Model do not suffer from this problem since they explicitly forbid \\"read-up.\\" Consequently, a computer system that complies with non-interference will not necessarily comply with the Bell-LaPadula Model. Thus, the Bell–LaPadula model and the non- interference model are incomparable: the Bell-LaPadula Model is stricter regarding read-up, and the non-interference model is stricter with respect to covert channels. =No summarisation= Some legitimate multilevel security activities treat individual data records (e.g., personal details) as sensitive, but allow statistical functions of the data (e.g., the mean, the total number) to be released more widely. This cannot be achieved with a non- interference machine. Generalizations The noninterference property requires that the system should not reveal any information about the high inputs from the observable output for various low inputs. However, one can argue that achieving noninterference is oftentimes not possible for a large class of practical systems, and moreover, it may not be desirable: programs need to reveal information that depends on the secret inputs, e.g. the output must be different when a user enters a correct credential vs when she enters incorrect credentials. Shannon entropy, guessing entropy, and min-entropy are prevalent notions of quantitative information leakage that generalize noninterferenceBoris Köpf and David Basin. 2007.

History =Second World War= In September 1939, at the start of the Second World War this brigade changed its title from Heavy Armoured Brigade (Egypt) to 4th Armoured Brigade.Brief History Of The British 4th Armoured Brigade On 27 July 1941, it handed over its units to the 1st Army Tank Brigade and received new units based in Egypt. It was reformed again when the HQ arrived in Sicily and it took control of new units there. The 4th Armoured Brigade saw service in the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Italian Campaign and in North- western Europe. Although it served under many different formations it was most famous as part of the 7th Armoured Division, the Desert Rats. The 4th Armoured Brigade left the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa in 1943 for the Allied Invasion Force for Normandy. In June 1944, the brigade landed in Normandy and served with distinction during the Battle of Normandy during the Battle for Caen. From Normandy until the end of the war, the 4th Armoured Brigade was composed as follows: *Royal Scots Greys (left 29 April 1945) *44th Royal Tank Regiment *3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) (became 3rd/4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) on 29 July 1944) * 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (left 14 May 1945) *1st East Riding Yeomanry (from 14 June 1945) The 4th Armoured Brigade was the first to cross the Rhine into Germany.Desert Rats Association website Order of battle, Second World War =Cold War Era= The Brigade spent many years in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine.

That same year, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Platoon was attached to the battalion and was mainly used for clearing ranges. In 1956, the battalion conducted a rigorous training cycle focusing on ambushes, construction, and bridging. The battalion demonstrated its bridging capabilities when the Santa Margarita River flooded in 1957. An unprecedented, 339 feet of M-6 bridging were used to span the swollen river which, at that time, was the longest M-6 Bridge ever erected. That same year, the battalion increased the size of the Fixed Bridge Platoon to a company and the Floating Bridge Platoon was re-designated as 1st Bridge Platoon together creating a new Bridge Company.

The video was partially shot during the song's debut live performance, at the band's December 31, 1993 New Year's Eve concert at the Worcester Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts. During the performance, the stage was decorated with aquarium props for the music video shoot. The video appeared a few times on MTV, including an abbreviated version on Beavis and Butt-head. The \\"Down with Disease\\" music video is the only one that has been produced by the band during its 30-year career, apart from a semi-official 1991 fan-made video for the song \\"Esther\\". In concert, \\"Down With Disease\\" has spanned from three, to ten, to over twenty minutes, often featuring full band improvisation. The longest standalone rendition of this song was the December 12th 1995 performance, which clocked in at 31 minutes and 20 seconds before segueing into \\"The Lizards\\".December 12, 1995 Setlist > Phish.net Online.

It was also shown in Germany, (Super RTL), US (Fox Family Channel), The Netherlands (Kindernet), France (TF! Jeunesse), and the UK (GMTV) in the following years. Its target audience is children in the age of 2 to 6 years old. It was one of the first fully CGI- animated series in the world. Format The program was created using computer-generated imagery (CGI) animation. The show was narrated by Rik Mayall. The Jellikins are jelly-made people that live in the Jelly Land, (made of jelly) which is the magical land at the end of the rainbow, where their main job is to make rainbows. (for which they have a machine called the Jelliscope, a computer/teleporter/rainbow generator which is constantly monitoring weather conditions around the world) Although each Jellikin has its own vehicle to drive around in, their main use of travelling long distances around Jelly Land is on the \\"Jelly Train\\", a train that only consists of a cab (no actual locomotive) and one passenger car. The show debuted in 1998 and ended in 2003. Jellabies is also known as Jellikins in parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. This official version is exactly the same as the Jellabies in every way, except the characters' heads were changed to look like gummy bears. However, Duffy the dragon remained the same. It aired on GMTV in the UK until 2004, and on Fox Family Channel in the United States of America, but has not aired since the end of 1999.  History  Jonny Lewis of Malvern, UK designed and created the world using 3D Studio Max software. It was loosely based on Jelly Babies sweets. Originating from humble beginnings in a dusty basement in Malvern and made on a home PC, it was signed up by a small editing house, Optical Image nr Birmingham, UK, commissioned by GMTV and then in many other countries around the world. It was the first British fully 3D computer animated series to make it on to television. With Optical Image sealing sponsorship from a confectionery company, Jonny Lewis directed a group of animators to make the series. Other animators who made considerable input were Meena Kamurai Pai, Andrew Lindsay, Richard, Andy Day, Ian Friend, Harjit Birdi, making each episode between them in a matter of days to meet a tight schedule. Editing was done by Ralph Tittley (also a director), Paul Perrins and Jason Bills. During the production of the many episodes, Jonny Lewis (the original designer and director of animation) left due to conflicting aims between him and the management. The company finished the production, but did not then go on to successfully produce another show that made it to TV, in spite of several more attempts. Songs written and composed by Vo Fletcher were written. Characters and voice cast Each of the six jellikins represent the colours of the rainbow. = Main = * Strum (played by Simon Shelton) lives at the train station, is purple, is the first Jellikin, and is the musical Jellikin who plays the saxophone. * Bouncey (played by Nicky Smedley) is the second Jellikin who lives in a bumper car, and is yellow, the same colour as lemons and the Sun. * Denny (played by Dave Thompson) is the third Jellikin who lives in a boat on the jelly-lake, and is blue, the same colour as the sky and the world's oceans. * Pepper (played by Chris Jarvis) is the fourth Jellikin who lives in a tree house and is red the same colour as ripe strawberries and apples. * Amber and Coral, (Amber played by Diana Rigg, Coral played by Pui Fan Lee) are the last two Jellikins who are orange and pink, respectively. Amber lives in a hot air balloon and Coral lives in a house made out of building blocks and toys which she can use to modify her house as she pleases.  Supporting  * Duffy the green Dragon (vocal effects performed by Jane Horrocks) the only non-Jellikin character in the entire show, is a dragon who lives in the Jelly Caves.

It was founded in 1926 by the Canadian Pacific Railway and named after Coronach, the horse who had just won The Derby in England that year. Coronach was officially incorporated in 1928. History After its incorporation in 1928 the town's population teetered in and around 300, until about 1974 when the town discovered that they were to receive the Poplar River Power Project. This project brought many new citizens to the town to help with the building and operation of the Power Plant. The Poplar River Power Plant can be seen from a distance with the large smoke stack extending above the town. With the Poplar River Power Project also came the development of the Coronach Coal Mine, which provides the coal/fuel to the Power Plant. The Coal mine has had a few locations and a variety of owners; it is currently owned by Westmoreland Coal Company. Demographics According to the 2016 Census Coronach has a population of 643 people, this is down from the 2011 census count of 711. The median age in Coronach is 43.0 years.

The municipal office of Rural Municipality #12 Poplar Valley lies within the boundaries of Rockglen, and Rockglen businesses are supported primarily by agriculture. In the Burning Hills agriculture consists of dry land farming and cattle. Rockglen is located along Highway 2 south of Assiniboia, Highway 18 west of Coronach, and Highways 2 and 18 north of Port Poplar River. In addition Rockglen Airport (CKC7) lies 2.2 km east of town. History Vestiges from before the last ice age, a land of hidden treasures, petrified wood and fossils, hammers and arrows of the Assiniboine, Plains Cree, and Blackfoot peoples. But it is the followers of Sitting Bull who left one of the strongest impressions. Following the Battle of Little Bighorn 5,000 Lakota Sioux Lakota fled to the Wood Mountain Uplands where they were under the jurisdiction of the North-West Mounted Police under the command of Major James Morrow Walsh. The hills, first surveyed by the Henry Youle Hind expedition in 1858, were used for hunting by day, and at night fires could be seen of meat being smoked. In 1879 the U.S. Cavalry set fires in Montana that spread and burned the grasslands of Rockglen, causing the ensuing famine and leading to the toponym \\"The Burning Hills.\\" It is in these Burning Hills where the Ferbane ranch was located. By 1910 the homestead became a post office, soon German and Austro-Hungarian settlers built homesteads out of tar paper shacks and sod huts. Wood building were built for businesses, such as the pool hall, which also contained the Wesley Methodist church, which became the Wesley United Church of Canada in 1925; Valley City became an unofficial community. To the north the Kent homestead became a post office in 1915. Soon thereafter Beromé Prefontaine built a store and by 1917 Joeville, named for Joseph Prefontaine, was founded as a village. In 1926 Joeville was a prosperous community when the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed a rail line south from Assiniboia, Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and Alberta Pacific both built elevators along the line. Joeville split into the French community of Liseux near the new elevators and 26 buildings were moved south to the new CPR junction near Valley City. Valley City was relocated north of the tracks and incorporated as the Village of Rockglen in 1927. Services were soon established in the tiny village. Mr. Sproul ran a school out of the Pinking Hotel on Centre Street. It was a community effort with desks and blackboards furnished by local carpenters and fundraising organized by Mr. Sproul. To the relief of Centre Street commerce a proper school house was built in 1928. It had three rooms: Mr. Preston as principal and two classes instructed by Miss Campbell and Miss Jarvis. In 1929 the Red Cross built a hospital, and a permanent post office was built, as was a branch of the Imperial Bank of Canada, and Charlie Switallo’s hardware store, which was the longest running Rockglen business to date. Electric lighting was provided from 1929–1950 by the Rockglen Power Company, which ran every day from dusk to midnight, when three flashes indicated shut down. It wasn’t until 1950 when the Saskatchewan Power Corporation came to Rockglen that full 24-hour 120- and 240-volt electric service came to Rockglen. The depression caused rural decline which was furthered by mechanization of agriculture during the later stages and in the time following the Second World War. Nearby Constance and Strathcona were dissolved and the one-room rural school houses were replaced by a system of buses and Bombardier tracked vehicles for winter use. Rockglen grew to a population of 500 persons when incorporated as a town with L. J. Bolster elected the first mayor. During the 1960s a new school was constructed, as well as a new post office, school office, Imperial Bank of Canada, and hotel. The late 1970s saw a rise of inflation, combined with exceptionally high grain prices; many farmers retired and moved into Rockglen. In 1975 construction began on the Poplar River Power Station in nearby Coronach commissioned in 1981. 1981 also saw the construction of a new Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator. This is currently the last elevator in Rockglen and is owned by Poplar Valley Producers Co- operative. The resulting population influx had led to development of homes along Second Avenue and construction of Hillcrest Drive. To date, these are the newest housing developments in Rockglen. In 1988, Rockglen resident Jack Wolfe was elected as a Progressive Conservative Member of Legislative Assembly a position in which he served until 1991. Since the 1970s residents of the area have claimed sightings of a humanoid figure, similar to a Bigfoot or Sasquatch, living near or on \\"Columbus\\" (a hill within the town). It has been described as ape-like in appearance and standing between 8 and 10 feet tall with a shrill voice and skunk-like in fragrance. Locals have named the creature \\"Zoobey\\" sometimes spelled \\"Zoobie\\" or shortened to \\"Zoobs\\". A small number of Rockglenites known as \\"The Zoob Troob\\" follow news regarding the creature and circulate a limited number, biannual newsletter called \\"The Zoobey Sask-watch\\" Some believe efforts have been made to cover up the existence of Zoobey while others believe the creature doesn't exist and claim never to have heard of it. Current government As a town Rockglen has a mayor fulfilling executive duties and a town council to pass bylaws. At present His Worship, Erwin Jackson is mayor. The judicial role is fulfilled by the provincial government in accordance with the Municipal Act. Geography and demographics At the 2001 census Rockglen occupies 2.82 km² with a population of 450 down 6.4% from a 1996 population of 481, occupying 239 homes. A service driven economy provides supplies, medical, veterinary, and entertainment to the surrounding rural economy, as well as an emerging retirement community.  Economy  Rockglen provides services to surrounding farms, ranches, feedlots, and employees of the Poplar River power station and nearby Poplar River Mine, in addition to a significant retirement population. The only light industry, though it too could be considered a service, is that of Nielson's Welding along Highway #2. The largest economic contributor is the Rockglen Co-op, which is the largest co-op south of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and through sales of products such as lumber to Montana cattlemen attracts a significant amount of foreign business. Rail transit was privately owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway until a shortline was taken over by Southern Rails Cooperative in 2006; Rockglen is now a transfer point between Southern Rails Cooperative and the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The album proved memorable enough for some music writers that it enjoyed continuing retrospective coverage into the 2000s.

Career =Early years in Denmark= Bechmann began his active career in 2000 at FC Aarhus, now called Aarhus Fremad. In 2002, he moved to first division side Esbjerg fB. In West Jutland he gained a regular place. =VfL Bochum= In the 2004–05 season, Bechmann moved abroad and signed with VfL Bochum, who played at that time still in the Bundesliga. At this time, there were two other Danish compatriots with Søren Colding and Peter Madsen under contract at the club from the Ruhr region (Ruhrgebiet). He gave his debut for the club on 7 August 2004, when he came on the opening day of the Bundesliga against Hertha BSC. He scored his is first goal for the Westphalians on 19 September 2004, when he marked the 1–0 lead in the match against SC Freiburg. At the end of the season, he had played 27 Bundesliga games, but the club was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. In the coming years, Bechmann could never achieve a regular starting place in Bochum, he wandered between the starting lineup and the bench due to injuries. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Bochum's promotion to the Bundesliga, he had surgery on the knee and played only eleven times in the 2006–07 season. 2007–08, his last season in Bochum, was initially very successful, as he scored four goals in the first four games but he was injured again in the second half of the season. =SC Freiburg= After his contract expired in Bochum, he moved to SC Freiburg who were playing in the second division. In his first season for the Breisgau side he scored seven goals and the club was promoted to the Bundesliga. =SønderjyskE= In 2011, Bechmann returned to his homeland and signed for Danish first division club SønderjyskE. On 17 July 2011, matchday one of the league, he made his starting eleven debut for the Slesvigers in a 0–2 defeat against FC Copenhagen. Bechmann made 25 appearances and scored five goals in league matches. In the following season he played 32 matches and scored eight goals. On 9 January 2017, he retired from professional football. Personal life On 28 October 2017, Bechmann won 5 million kroner (approx. €672,000) in the Danish Lotto lottery.

Dawes, a descendant of American Revolution hero William Dawes and the son of American Civil War Brevet Brigadier General Rufus R. Dawes, was born in Marietta, Ohio. Three brothers also gained international prominence in politics and business: Charles G. Dawes, Rufus C. Dawes, and Henry May Dawes. Beman attended the public schools of Marietta and graduated from Marietta College with the Class of 1890. He married Bertie Burr on October 3, 1894. Dawes engaged in agriculture and engineering, and became interested in public utilities. He was President of The Ohio River Bridge & Ferry Company in 1903 when the Williamstown - Marietta Bridge was constructed. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio's 15th District from 1905 to 1909, the Fifty-ninth and Sixtieth United States Congresses. After his retirement from Congress, Dawes became interested in the production of oil and the building of electric railways. Along with his wife, he founded the Dawes Arboretum, an endowed institution dedicated to the education of youth. In 1914, he was elected president and chairman of the board of directors of the Pure Oil Company. Beman Gates Dawes died in Newark, Ohio. His body was entombed in a mausoleum at the Dawes Arboretum.

Nakayama was born in Nagano Prefecture, Nakano City, in 1887. His father died while he was very young, and his mother Zō raised Shimpei, his older brother and other siblings alone. She often took in washing and sewing to make ends meet. Shimpei was interested in music from the time he attended Nakano Elementary School, where he and his classmates would sing to the accompaniment of a small organ (what he called a \\"baby organ\\"). The songs they sang included popular military marches from the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95). At one point a small brass band sponsored by the Salvation Army came to town to play, and Nakayama remembers being smitten by the sound. His classmates remember him as an accomplished player of the Japanese transverse flute who would often play during Obon and other festivals at the local Shinto shrines and Buddhist temple. When Shimpei graduated from elementary school he took the required examinations and became a substitute elementary school teacher. His dream was to become a music teacher. For that, he had to go to school in Tokyo. So in 1905 he moved to Japan's capitol city and became a household servant for Waseda University English Literature professor Shimamura Hōgetsu. In 1914, Nakayama composed the song \\"Katyusha's song\\" for a dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection. The song, sung by actress Sumako Matsui, was a massive hit and Nakayama became famous almost overnight. Today this song is considered one of the earliest examples of modern Japanese popular music. Another of his most famous songs is \\"Tokyo ondo\\", which was a great countrywide hit in the 1930s.Piers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s, p440-1 Today it is also known as the theme song of the baseball team Tokyo Yakult Swallows.

He played for the Bulls in the Super Rugby competition. Rossouw made his provincial debut during 1999 for the Blue Bulls in a match against the North Western Province in the Currie Cup competition. In 2001 he made his Super 12 (now Super Rugby) debut for the Bulls against the Cats. Rossouw made his first international appearance in the Springboks' opening pool game against Uruguay at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. He scored a try in the game as well. He did not play in the subsequent match against England, but returned for the game against Georgia, scoring two tries. He played in all the remaining matches until South Africa were knocked out by All Blacks in the quarterfinals. Rossouw was picked as first-choice Number 8 for the Springboks in their successful world cup campaign of 2007. This was a result of Pierre Spies' unfortunate illness, however Rossouw would no doubt have featured in the squad regardless. His performances included a try in the semifinal against Argentina. He received what looked like a campaign ending injury in the pool clash with Tonga as he was carried off the field with a neck injury. However he recovered and played an important part in the rest of the Springboks march to victory, including a try-saving tackle on Mark Cueto in the final. Rossouw has won 3 Currie Cup titles, 3 Super Rugby titles, a Japanese title and cup, a Heineken Cup, a Top 14 French Title, a Tri-Nations title, a World Cup and a series victory over the British and Irish Lions.

In an analog-to-digital converter application, signal conditioning includes voltage or current limiting and anti-aliasing filtering. In control engineering applications, it is common to have a sensing stage (which consists of a sensor), a signal conditioning stage (where usually amplification of the signal is done) and a processing stage (often carried out by an ADC and a micro-controller). Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are commonly employed to carry out the amplification of the signal in the signal conditioning stage. In some transducers this feature will come inherent for example in Hall effect sensors. In power electronics, before processing the input sensed signals by sensors like voltage sensor and current sensor, signal conditioning scales signals to level acceptable to the microprocessor. Inputs Signal inputs accepted by signal conditioners include DC voltage and current, AC voltage and current, frequency and electric charge. Sensor inputs can be accelerometer, thermocouple, thermistor, resistance thermometer, strain gauge or bridge, and LVDT or RVDT. Specialized inputs include encoder, counter or tachometer, timer or clock, relay or switch, and other specialized inputs. Outputs for signal conditioning equipment can be voltage, current, frequency, timer or counter, relay, resistance or potentiometer, and other specialized outputs. Processes Signal conditioning can include amplification, filtering, converting, range matching, isolation and any other processes required to make sensor output suitable for processing after conditioning. = Filtering = Filtering is the most common signal conditioning function, as usually not all the signal frequency spectrum contains valid data. For example, the 50 or 60 Hz AC power lines, present in most environments induce noise on signals that can cause interference if amplified. = Amplification = Signal amplification performs two important functions: increases the resolution of the input signal, and increases its signal-to-noise ratio. For example, the output of an electronic temperature sensor, which is probably in the millivolts range is probably too low for an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to process directly. In this case it is necessary to bring the voltage level up to that required by the ADC. Commonly used amplifiers used for signal conditioning include sample and hold amplifiers, peak detectors, log amplifiers, antilog amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers and programmable gain amplifiers.\\"Data acquisition techniques using PCs.\\" Academic-Press - Pages 44-47 =Attenuation= Attenuation, the opposite of amplification, is necessary when voltages to be digitized are beyond the ADC range. This form of signal conditioning decreases the input signal amplitude so that the conditioned signal is within ADC range. Attenuation is typically necessary when measuring voltages that are more than 10 V. =Excitation= External power is required for the operation of a passive sensor. (E.g. a temperature sensor like a thermistor & RTD, a pressure sensor (piezo-resistive and capacitive), etc.). The stability and precision of the excitation signal directly relates to the sensor accuracy and stability. =Linearization= Linearization is necessary when sensors produce voltage signals that are not linearly related to the physical measurement. Linearization is the process of interpreting the signal from the sensor and can be done either with signal conditioning or through software. =Electrical isolation= Signal isolation may be used to pass the signal from the source to the measuring device without a physical connection. It is often used to isolate possible sources of signal perturbations that could otherwise follow the electrical path from the sensor to the processing circuitry. In some situations, it may be important to isolate the potentially expensive equipment used to process the signal after conditioning from the sensor. Magnetic or optical isolation can be used. Magnetic isolation transforms the signal from a voltage to a magnetic field so the signal can be transmitted without physical connection (for example, using a transformer). Optical isolation works by using an electronic signal to modulate a signal encoded by light transmission (optical encoding). The decoded light transmission is then used for input for the next stage of processing. =Surge protection= A surge protector absorbs voltage spikes to protect the next stage from damage.

He was the recipient of a 2006 Guggenheim fellowship, and a 2015 American Academy of Arts and Letters Award.https://artsandletters.org/awards/  Education and Background  Composer Scott Johnson was born in 1952 in Madison, Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, majoring in visual arts, and dividing his time between visual arts and music. In 1975 he moved to New York City and became involved in the thriving art scene in downtown Manhattan. He initially focused on the visual arts, including sculpture, performance, and installation art, with shows at Artists Space and The Franklin Furnace. He also began to play guitar in other people's projects, working with such artists as Laurie Anderson and Rhys Chatham. Eventually his increasing use of manipulated audiotape in his performance and installation work led to a re- engagement with music, and he began to perform his own compositions at venues including The Kitchen, the premiere avant-garde music, dance, and performance art space of the time.  John Somebody and Early Work  Johnson's 1982 work John Somebody for electric guitar and recorded speech is an early example of speech melody framed in tonal harmony. It is the first instance of an instrumental score based on the melodies of spoken phrases, and used as an accompaniment to those recorded phrases. It is named for the opening tape loop of a single female voice, repeating these phrases, which are then imitated by layered guitars: :You know who's in New York? :You remember that guy... J-John somebody? :He was a he was sort of a... Johnson's early works were created long before the advent of digital music editing. Creating tape loops like this meant actually cutting and splicing long strips of magnetic tape into loops, running them through a player to dub onto a destination tape. Modern digital audio sampling technology allows for a far more efficient process. For example, a 2015 work, Mind out of Matter, contains more than 2,500 words. Johnson's technique of transcribing speech melodies for use in instrumental scores has since been used by a number of composers, including Jacob Ter Veldhuis, Robert Davidson, Florent Ghys, and Steve Reich.Zachary Woolf, \\"Taking Words and Music and Bending Identities\\", The New York Times, Oct. 6, 2014, David Patrick Stearns, \\"Scott Johnson's Mind Out of Matter: Should Music Make So Much Sense?\\" Arts JournalDaniel Stephen Johnson,\\"Scott Johnson's Pioneering 'Speech Melody' and Hybridism,\\" Q2 Music, March 14, 2012, Michael Schell, \\"Scott Johnson: Mind Out of Matter, Music Out of Speech\\", Second Inversion Johnson has listed three influences for his invention of this technique: Messiaen's transcription of bird songs, call and response in American blues, and the early speech tape loop works of Steve Reich, It's Gonna Rain (1965) and Come Out (1966).Frank Oteri, \\"Scott Johnson: The Cultural Version of DNA Mixing.\\" New Music Box, April 1, 2016, DNA- mixing/Zachary Woolf, \\"Taking Words and Music and Bending Identities\\", The New York Times, Oct. 6, 2014, Keith Potter, Four Musical Minimalists: La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, 2000, Cambridge University Press, p247, . Those works used looped speech, but did not involve any instrumental writing derived from the speech. Reich later adopted Johnson's speech transcription technique for Different Trains (1986) and subsequent speech sampling works. During the same years that John Somebody was being written, Johnson composed Five Movements, a 30 minute work for solo electric guitar and live electronic processing, using the pitch-shifting capabilities of an Eventide Harmonizer. John Somebody is performed as a work for solo electric guitar and a prerecorded backing track, and together with Five Movements it was a staple of Johnson's solo performances in America and Europe.Gregory Sandow, \\"Vernacular Roots\\", The Village Voice, April 27, 1982.Richard Buell, \\"Scott Johnson's Best of Both Worlds\\". The Boston Globe, November 1, 1983. The Eventide Harmonizer was also used to create the tape tracks for two other works for solo guitar and tape, No Memory and U79, which used electronically altered voice sounds rather than comprehensible speech.  Later Work  During the 1980s and early 1990s, Johnson composed work for two ensembles of his own, and performed as guitarist. The first was an octet with the instrumentation of a large rock band: electric guitars, saxophones, and percussion.Mark Swed \\"Rock 'n' Roll, Formally Structured\\". The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, November 9, 1985.Jim Farber \\"New Music America Festival - Scott Johnson.\\" Variety, November 11, 1985.Alan Kozinn \\"Vibrant Beaux Arts Trio, Scott Johnson, John Zorn.\\" The New York Observer, October 6, 1989. Beginning in 1989, he organized a quartet of violin, cello, electric guitar, and piano/synthesizer. This ensemble released a 1996 CD called Rock/Paper/Scissors, including an instrumental work of that title and a speech sampling work called Convertible Debts. During the 1980s Johnson also received his first commission from the Kronos Quartet, and wrote the music for director Paul Schrader's 1988 film Patty Hearst.John Rockwell, \\"Music for Movies: Trickier Than It Looks\\", The New York Times, January 29, 1989, Stephen Holden \\"An Experimental Soundtrack for the Film 'Patty Hearst'\\", The New York Times, September 21, 1988.Tom Moon, \\"'Patty Hearst' Sound Track Stands Up Well on its Own\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, October 6, 1988. In this project, he returned to the use of recorded speech, featuring Actress Natasha Richardson as Hearst. In the 1990s, he wrote an hour long work for the Kronos Quartet, How it Happens, based on the sampled voice of journalist I.F. Stone.Alan Kozinn, \\"Music in Review - the Kronos Quartet\\", The New York Times, April 23, 1991, Joshua Kosman, \\"Kronos Play on Words\\", San Francisco Chronicle, June 24, 1991.Joshua Kosman, \\"Kronos Live with Tape,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, November 16, 1992. Since 2000, Johnson has continued to write both commissioned works and music for ensembles of his own making. These include Americans, a speech sampling work based on the voices of immigrants to the United States, and scored for a septet that resembles an extended rock band.David Patrick Stearns, \\"Americans,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, Joshua Kosman, \\"CD Review: Scott Johnson\\", San Francisco Chronicle, August 1, 2010, Alexandra Gardner, \\"Sounds Heard: Scott Johnson-Americans\\", New Music Box, August 4, 2010, Assembly Required is a wholly instrumental work written for the same ensemble. Other distinctive instrumentations include Up and Back, for shamisen, electric guitar, cello, and piano; and Bowery Haunt, for electric guitar duo. Commissioned works include The Illusion of Guidance for the Bang on a Can All- Stars, Last Time Told for the Cygnus Ensemble, and Stalking Horse, for the American Composer's Orchestra. Johnson's largest work to date, Mind Out of Matter, is based on the sampled voice of American philosopher Daniel C. Dennett.Matthew Guerrieri, \\"A Tour de Force on the Idea of Ideas,\\" The Boston Globe, March 5, 2016,Zachary Woolf, \\"Taking Words and Music and Bending Identites\\", The New York Times, October 6, 2014, David Patrick Stearns, \\"Scott Johnson's Mind Out of Matter: Should Music Make So Much Sense?\\", Arts Journal, Daniel Stephen Johnson, \\"Scott Johnson: Pioneering 'Speech Melody' and Hybridism\\", Q2 Music, March 14, 2012, Michael Schell, \\"Scott Johnson: Mind Out of Matter, Music Out of Speech\\", Second Inversion, July 18, 2018, It has been performed and recorded by the contemporary music ensemble Alarm Will Sound. This evening length work explores Dennett's scientifically-oriented view of the origins and evolution of religion. As with How it Happens and Americans, it engages directly with social and political issues, placing a reality-based text within an expressive musical setting that is ultimately derived from the melodies of the speaker's recorded voice. Johnson has been a vocal proponent of opening the classical tradition to influences derived from living popular music. He has given talks on this aspect of his work at major universities and conservatories, and his extended essay The Counterpoint of Species looks at the evolution of musical styles through the lens of Darwinian principles. It was published in Arcana: Musicians on Music, edited by John Zorn,John Zorn, Arcana: Musicians on Music, Granary Books, pub. 2000. and quoted in Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin's Music in The Western World (2nd Edition).

It was available for both Windows and Mac computer systems. The server part of Pathworks ran on VAX/VMS or Ultrix and enabled a DEC VAX or VAXcluster to act as a file and print server for client IBM PC compatible and Macintosh workstations. Pathworks server was derived from LanMan/X, the portable version of OS/2 LAN Manager. PATHWORKS was one of DEC's most successful products ever. It was probably the only DEC software product to sell over one million licenses. Since each license was priced at $495, that was $0.5B USD just in license revenue. Analysis of sales showed that on average, each PATHWORKS license dragged at least $3,000 USD in server revenue (server HW, SW, storage, printers, networking, and services), so it was a major driver for DEC's revenue in the mid and late 1980s. Before it was named PATHWORKS, it was also referred to as PCSA (Personal Computing Systems Architecture).  Features  Once installed onto the PCs, the Pathworks client provided the following features: * DECnet, and later TCP/IP, end-node connectivity with the host and client systems * PowerTerm 525 Terminal emulation software from Ericom * File-transfer software. This was a DECnet-DOS file transfer utility, although it was somewhat superfluous because the PATHWORKS server software presented VMS or UNIX files to the PC clients as if they were PC files being served by a Windows server. The PATHWORKS server software provided access to server file storage and print services using the native Microsoft protocols. Later versions of PATHWORKS servers on VMS supported NetWare and Macintosh clients, but they never achieved the volumes of the Microsoft clients. For clients running a GUI such as Windows 3.x, additional components available included an X window system server, allowing clients to access graphical apps running on VMS or UNIX hosts, and clients for DEC's ALL-IN-1 email and groupware system. Although primitive by modern standards, PATHWORKS was very sophisticated for its time; far more than just a file and print server, it made client microcomputers into terminals and workstations on a DEC network.  Implementation  LanMan normally ran across Microsoft's basic, non-routable NetBIOS/NetBEUI NBF protocol, but Pathworks included a DECnet stack, including layers like the LAT transport used for terminal sessions. The complexity of DECnet by 1980s PC standards meant that the Pathworks client was a huge software stack to have resident in MS-DOS; configuring the Pathworks client was a complex task, made more so by the need to preserve enough Conventional memory for DOS applications to run. To keep a reasonable amount of base memory free mandated the use of QEMM or a similar memory manager. This problem went away once 386-based PCs became prevalent and MS Windows provided built-in support for large amounts of memory.  History  References Category:OpenVMS software Pathworks used the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and had VMS and Ultrix server versions.

He matriculated with honours in 1909 and qualified as an architect at the Architectural Association in England. He also studied in France for a while and was exposed to classical Roman and Renaissance architecture in Italy. Moerdyk was the first South African to be an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Moerdyk returned to South Africa in 1913 and received first prize for the design of a church in Bothaville. He started his own practice and received more than eighty commissions to design churches. In his designs Moerdyk broke with the traditional crucifix plan, and replaced it with an octagonal formation, and incorporated domes, crescent-shaped windows and Cape Dutch gables. Another Church, the Nederduitse Hervormde Kerk, was designed in 1935. He was a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond He also designed several bank buildings, hospitals, houses and city halls. Commissioned works for which he is famous is the Reserve Bank building in Bloemfontein, the Libertas building in Pretoria (now known as Mahlamba Ndlopfu) and the Merensky Library at the University of Pretoria. This last building, now known as the Old Merensky Library - since a new library has been built - houses the Edoardo Villa Museum with the leading collection of sculptures by the artist Eduardo Villa.

The foundation stone for this building was laid in 1937 by General Jan Smuts, then Prime Minister of South Africa. In 1991 it was declared a National Monument. It was later redesignated a provincial heritage site and in 2012 became a national heritage site. =Voortrekker Monument= Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria The Voortrekker Monument on Proclamation Hill at the southern outskirts of Pretoria is considered to be Moerdyk's masterpiece. He was a South African Freemason. The Central \\"Volks\\" (People's) Monuments Committee started a \\"Structure Committee\\" which approached the public in 1936 for suggestions about the contents and form of a monument. Several sketches from sculptors, architects and other artists were submitted. Moerdyk’s design was eventually chosen. E.C Pienaar and A.d. Bouman designed the sculptural laager, or ring of ox-wagons, around the monument. The South African Academy for Arts and Science awarded Moerdyk an honorary membership in 1936 and in 1950 the University of South Africa awarded him an honorary doctorate. Legacy The Dutch Reformed Church in Piet Retief was designed and built in 1921. A well-known Colonial African restaurant in the Pretoria suburb Arcadia is named Gerard Moerdyk Restaurant, after him. Pretoria also has an arts district on Gerard Moerdyk Street in the suburb of Sunnyside. It is known as The Overzicht Artists' Village and consists of old cottages, which were built around the 19th century. The village has theatres, craft shops, restaurants and an education museum. Moerdijk's family home in Pretoria, Moerdijkhuis, was declared a national monument in 1986 and was turned into a guesthouse by Moerdijk's grandson and his wife, in order to enable access to the monument while ensuring economic sustainability of this national asset.

The house is Grade I listed. and has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1975. History The building was constructed for Sir Thomas Mompesson, MP for the constituency of Salisbury in 1679, 1695 and 1701. The site was purchased at the end of the 17th century and the house reflects the classic Queen Anne style of that period with Chilmark stone facing. To the right of the main house stands the brick-built service building which was constructed on the site of the old Eagle Inn that closed in 1625. Thomas's son Charles completed the building in 1701; his initials and date can be seen on the heads of the water downpipes. After Charles' death in 1714, his brother-in-law Charles Longueville moved into the house with his widowed sister, Elizabeth. Charles added the plasterwork, staircase and the brick wing. From them the house passed via Charles' natural son, John Clark, to Mrs Hayter. Next the house was occupied by the Portman sisters, the last of whom died at a great age in 1846., The Townsend family occupied the house from 1846 to 1939, and the flamboyant artist Miss Barbara Townsend, mentioned in Edith Olivier's book Four Victorian Ladies of Wiltshire, lived there for the whole of her 96 years. The Bishop of Salisbury, Neville Lovett, lived there from 1942 to 1946. In 1952 the freehold was purchased from the Church Commissioners by the architect, Denis Martineau, who bequeathed it to the National Trust on his death in 1975, a condition of the sale. The overthrow, iron railings, gates and iron lamps at the front of the building are Grade I listed separately from the house.  Collections  The house is used to display the Turnbull collection of English 18th-century drinking glasses bequeathed to the Trust in 1970. It also houses the Bessemer-Wright collection of ceramics, bequeathed by Mrs Adam Smith. In popular culture Mompesson House was used as a location for the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility.

This tract was called the Lafayette Land Grant and encompassed over 23,000 acres. While the Marquis never came to visit his property, he designated an agent to sell parcels of it on his behalf. The 2,400 acres upon which Goodwood Plantation was sited was purchased by Hardy Croom from the Lafayette Grant in 1834. Goodwood Plantation (also known as Old Croom Mansion) was a medium-sized cotton plantation of about 1,675 acres (7 km2) in central Leon County, Florida, established by Hardy Bryan Croom. It is located at 1600 Miccosukee Road. The plantation was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30, 1972. Goodwood Museum & Gardens The plantation home is now a historic house museum known as Goodwood Museum & Gardens that features original family furniture, porcelain, textiles, glassware, art and personal effects. The rooms have been decorated to appear in the years surrounding World War I. The house is visited by guided tour, for which there is a fee. The grounds cover , and the gardens also feature an early 20th-century design. Admission to the gardens is free. Plantation specifics The 1850 U.S. Federal Census Slave Schedule listed Bryan Croom as owning 84 enslaved people. The Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows that Goodwood Plantation had the following: * Improved Land: 1050 acres (4 km²) * Unimproved Land: 625 acres (2½ km²) * Cash value of plantation: $33,640 * Cash value of farm implements/machinery: $600 * Cash value of farm animals: $3000 * Number of slaves: unknown * Bushels of corn: 2500 * Bales of cotton: 150 ( It is not known why the number of enslaved people was not listed in 1860, but in 1857, Arvah Hopkins bought 40 slaves, together with his purchase of the real estate. He later purchased more enslaved people. ) At Goodwood Plantation's greatest extent,it constituted more than 8,000 non contiguous acres. The owners The Croom family of Lenoir County, North Carolina, wealthy tobacco planters, began purchasing land in North Florida in the 1820s, including plantations in Mariana, Quincy and Tallahassee. Hardy Bryan Croom, a planter and amateur naturalist, brought attention to the now rare stinking cedar. He began amassing the land for the estate which come to be known as Goodwood, purchasing about of the Lafayette Land Grant in 1833. His younger brother, Bryan Croom, made similar purchases. The men brought a number of enslaved people with them from North Carolina, and throughout the Croom years, purchased many more slaves to operate their cotton and corn plantations. On Saturday, October 7, 1837, Hardy B. Croom and his wife, three children—two daughters and a son—accompanied by a maternal aunt, boarded the steam packet liner S.S. Home in New York City bound for Charleston. The Home sank off the coast of North Carolina during the 1837 Racer's Storm, a Hurricane. The entire family perished in the wreck. No will was found, so his brother, Bryan Croom, assumed he had inherited his brother's Florida plantation property. A small home was framed in on the site at Hardy's death, and Bryan's enslaved workers completed it. But Bryan Croom ordered construction of a long planned main house thereafter. Construction of the approximately 10,000 square foot mansion was finalized 1850 or earlier. The house, which design may have been that chosen by the doomed Hardy, was built mainly by enslaved laborers also. Richard Shine, a prominent Tallahassee builder at the time, oversaw the construction. When completed, the house was Italianate in style, a dark rose color with ornate burgundy colored railings. While the reason the house was named Goodwood is unclear, it became known by that name in the 1840s. By 1845, Bryan claimed ownership of some 2,500 acres (10 km²) of land in Leon County alone, making him one of the wealthiest men in the area. Hardy Croom (1837) Arvah Hopkins (1866) After the Home tragedy, relatives of Hardy's wife Frances, primarily her mother, Henrietta Smith, fought what became a landmark court case. The court case dragged on for some 20 years. Who would inherit when an entire family perished in a common disaster without a will ? Mrs.Smith did not initially sue, but first asked her son -in -law's brother, Bryan Croom, for a part of the estate, in light of the loss of her daughter, grandchildren and her sister. Bryan, however, declined to cede Mrs. Smith anything. Bryan Croom won in lower court proceedings. But the Florida Supreme Court ultimately awarded the Smith Family much of the estate in 1857. The issues were two: was Hardy domiciled in North Carolina at the time of his death, or was he domiciled in Florida, where his large plantation interests were? The laws of the two states were different. The second issue was: who died last in the wreck of the steamship Home—someone in the maternal line or Hardy himself? The Florida Supreme Court decided Hardy was still domiciled In North Carolina at the time of his death. The Court also decided he had not intended to establish domicile in Florida when he boarded the Home, but had instead, based on his last letters, determined to relocate his family to Charleston, South Carolina, where he had rented a house. But Hardy and his family drowned before reaching another state. Testimony from witnesses who survived the Home tragedy testified that Hardy's son ( hence representative of the maternal line ) was the last surviving member of the family. Witnesses saw his son clinging to a spar in the ocean, after all the other Crooms had perished. Mrs. Smith did not come to Goodwood to live, but in 1858, sold the estate to Arvah Hopkins. Hopkins, a New Yorker, was a prominent local merchant who had married the educated and well-to-do Susan Branch, the youngest daughter of former North Carolina Governor John Branch. The couple had nine children, of whom eight survived to adulthood. The Hopkins were also large scale slave holders who continued formal plantation operations until 1865. The Hopkins farming operations continued after the war, with share cropping and tenant farming done mostly by formerly enslaved people. In 1885 an Englishman, Dr. William L. Arrowsmith, claiming to have been surgeon-general to the Italian Giuseppe Garibaldi, as well as holding other offices in Europe, purchased Goodwood and surrounding it. He brought with him some of the paintings and furnishings still in the house. Arrowsmith died about eight months later, leaving his wife and her companion, Martha Dykes, to live on the estate for more than the next twenty years. Mrs. Arrowsmith is buried in Tallahassee, leaving what was left of her personal estate to Miss Dykes. Before her death, Mrs. Arrowsmith sold Goodwood to an extremely wealthy widow, Mrs. Alexander (Frances) Tiers. The year was 1911. Fannie Tiers, whose principal estate, Farmlands, was in Morris County, New Jersey, was related by marriage to the Fleischmann family, owners of Waverly Plantation, which was adjacent to Goodwood. Although she spent only the winter months at Goodwood, Mrs. Tiers instituted an expansive renovation of the estate and remodeled the house to a Mt Vernon style and replaced the wrought iron with Georgian columns. She remodeled three other antebellum structures, the original kitchen, the original small house and a building whose original use remains uncertain. It may have been a storehouse or commissary, a place where bricks were made or other plantation industries occurred. These buildings still stand. Mrs. Tiers added a water tower, where previously wells, cisterns and pumps supplied the plantation. She built an amusement hall, guest cottages, servant quarters, a heated swimming pool, tennis courts and a carriage house. Mrs. Tiers entertained lavishly, and many of her wealthy friends came from the North to enjoy North Florida's warm winters. Mrs.Tiers moved to Paris in 1925, selling Goodwood to Florida State Senator William C. Hodges. Senator Hodges married his wife Margaret Wilson when she was 18 and he was 41 years of age. The couple had no children. They did entertain lavishly at Goodwood, not only politicians but an eclectic group of visitors, including artists, writers and numerous public figures. They kept macaws, peacocks, parrots, and ornamental fowl. They also owned small monkeys, some known for escaping into the neighborhood. Senator Hodges, a lifelong cigar smoker, died of a heart condition at Goodwood in 1940. Mrs. Hodges, at friend's urging ran for her husband's unexpired senate term. She initially announced she would do so, providing she could run unopposed. Others did oppose her however, and she lost. Mrs. Hodges rented the guest cottages for income after her husband died. In 1948, Margaret Hodges remarried. Her second husband was Thomas Milton Hood, a West Virginia native and Army Air Corps Major she had met through the rental of one of her guest cottages. Margaret was more than 10 years her new husband's senior. The Tallahassee Democrat, in a March 3, 1948, article reported that the two had filed for a marriage license. The prospective groom was described as a \\" Washington DC designer and an engineer. \\" After his wife's death in 1978, Major Hood rented out the guest cottages to a colorful group of people, creating an artist's colony atmosphere. He also began planning for the restoration of Goodwood as a house museum and public park. He established the Margaret E. Wilson Foundation in her memory. He died in 1990, after years of poor health. Tom Hood also left the Atkinson Children's Trust for Margaret's Great Nephews and Neices. Christine Wilson Atkinson, Diane Margaret Atkinson, Thomas Patrick Atkinson, David lane Atkinson and William Hodges Atkinson. The survival of Goodwood is due in large part to the Major's efforts, for he resisted calls to sell or donate Goodwood to the state, to sell it otherwise, or allow it to be torn down for development. After his death,the Margaret E. Wilson Foundation and its operating agent Goodwood Museum and Gardens, Inc. assumed stewardship for Goodwood. View from the barn.

This experimental style movie, which does not use central characters, explores the topic of suicide and violent death in the form of seven episodes, each one attributed to one day of the week. These episodes are enframed by the vision of a human body, slowly rotting during the course of the movie. Synopsis Monday A man comes home, phones his boss to resign from his job, writes mysterious letters, cleans his apartment and swallows poison in his bathtub. His death is simultaneous with the death of his fish, the only being that was close to him. Tuesday A man rents a film in a video store, a Nazisploitation movie in which Nazi soldiers are torturing a prisoner in a concentration camp, castrating him and painting a swastika on his breast. When the young man's girlfriend comes home, she yells at him until he shoots her. He then places a picture frame over the place on the wall where her brain matter was splattered. This whole episode is revealed as being shown on a TV screen in a room where somebody else committed suicide by hanging. Wednesday A man and a girl meet in a park in the pouring rain. The man tells the girl about his disastrous sex life with his wife which led to him killing her. The girl pulls out a gun to kill him, but the man takes it from her and shoots himself. Thursday A motorway bridge somewhere in Germany, superimposed by the names, ages, and occupations of the people who have jumped from it. Friday A woman, alone in her apartment, is observing a young, seemingly happy couple in the neighbourhood. She spies on them and finds a chain letter in front of her door, urging her to kill herself. Obviously everybody in the house got the letter. She ignores it, eats chocolates and falls asleep, dreaming of surprising her parents when they make love. The camera shows the young couple, dead on their bed. Saturday A young woman, equipped with a camera and a gun, kills several people in the audience of a rock concert (the frontman is played by Die Ärzte drummer Bela B.) and records it on film, until someone kills her. Sunday A man, alone on his bed, is crying and banging his head over and over, violently against the wall, until he succumbs to brain damage.

Owned by Bell Media, the station broadcasts a sports talk format branded as TSN Radio 1040. CKST's studios are located on Robson and Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, while its transmitters are located in Delta. History CKST went on the air for the first time on January 19, 1963 in Langley as CJJC, broadcasting on its original frequency of 850 AM with 1000 watts of power and offering a country music format. The station's original owner was City & Country Radio Ltd., headed by former CJAV and CKNW personality Joe Chesney. CJJC was given approval by the CRTC on December 15, 1970 to change its frequency and transmission power from 850 AM and 1000 watts to 800 AM and 10,000 watts, but the station waited until June 1975 to put the change into effect. In 1977, CJJC (which had been dealing with financial trouble for some time) rehired 23 of 32 staff members who were given 30 days notice on New Year's Eve. Parent company City & Country Radio was authorized to transfer all of the station's shares to a company run by Joe Chesney and Ernie Mykyte; Mykyte would become sole owner of CJJC in 1978 when he bought out Chesney's half-interest in the station. CJJC and parent City & Country Radio were purchased on June 26, 1985 (following CRTC approval) by an ownership consortium of Saskatoon Telecable Ltd. (72%), Sam Folstad (18%) and L.M. McDonald (10%); later in the year, CJJC changed its call letters to CJUP and dropped its country format for Top 40 with Up Radio, AM 800 as its on-air name. In 1987, CJUP majority shareholder Saskatoon Telecable was purchased by Clint Forster and his family, and the station changed call letters again to the present CKST in 1988. On July 7, 1989, CKST increased its power to 25,000 watts and began broadcasting in stereo. CKST switched formats to modern rock and adopted the on-air name Coast 800 on November 9, 1990. The station underwent major changes during the early part of 1992; on January 30, the CRTC authorized station owner Western World Communications (the former Saskatoon Telecable) to buy Vancouver station CIMA (which had begun operations on September 12, 1986Decision CRTC 85-1054 as CIOF, then CKXY, then CIMA) from Monarch Broadcasting Ltd., also granting permission to CKST to switch frequencies (from 800 to 1040), increase transmission power (from 25,000 watts to 50,000), relocate its transmitter from Aldergrove to Delta and move its operations from Langley to Vancouver.Decision CRTC 92-27 CIMA 1040 signed off for the final time on February 4, and CKST moved into CIMA's facilities and became Coast 1040 on March 9. Plans were made to move CKST to the FM band (at 94.5 FM with 38,000 watts of power) in 1993, but were denied by the CRTC.Decision CRTC 93-75 CKST ended its modern rock format at midnight on September 30, relaunching with an adult standards format under the new on-air name Q104 (which was later dropped in favour of using the CKST calls). The station was purchased by Ronald Dixon and Gary Mathiesen in 1994. CKST was in the process of being sold when Dixon was killed in a car accident in Mexico on September 15, 2000; the station would be sold to Grand Slam Radio Inc., which assumed ownership on February 1, 2001, switched CKST to its present all-sports format and adopted its current on-air name \\"The TEAM 1040\\" on April 25, and joined CHUM's TEAM all-sports network on May 7. Station founder Joe Chesney died in Langley on November 10, 2001, at the age of 82, and CHUM would purchase CKST on February 10, 2003, adding to the company's ownership of CFUN, CHQM-FM and CKVU-TV in Vancouver. It was a member of CHUM Limited's short- lived \\"The Team\\" sports radio network in 2001-2002 and remains loosely affiliated with those stations that retained the sports format. It competed heavily with CHMJ (\\"MOJO Sports Radio\\"), an all-sports station in Vancouver owned by Corus Entertainment, until that station dropped its sports format in May 2006. The station made headlines in 2003 when host John Conners made comments about Vancouver Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi's wife on the air. Conners was fired by CKST after the Canucks revoked their accreditation of its reporters and pulled their advertising from the station in response to the incident. In 2004, it acquired the radio broadcast rights for BC Lions football games, beating longtime broadcaster CKNW. Veteran play-by-play man J. Paul McConnell stayed with CKNW, while colour analyst Giulio Caravatta moved to CKST and joined new play-by-play announcer Rick Ball. 200px In the spring of 2006, in what was seen as a major gain for the station, it acquired the broadcasting rights for the Canucks, which had long been the staple of rival CKNW. The play-by-play team of John Shorthouse and Tom Larscheid also moved stations from CKNW to CKST. CTVglobemedia purchased CKST and its sister radio stations in Vancouver as part of the acquisition of CHUM Limited on June 22, 2007, following its approval by the CRTC, while former co-owned CKVU was sold to Rogers Communications on October 31, 2007. Starting in October 2008, the station began splitting Canucks play-by-play duties between John Shorthouse and new announcer's Joey Kenward and Rick Ball. Kenward calls the Canucks broadcasts when the team is on the road, Ball calls the show for the home games. Both new hosts fill in only when Shorthouse does the television play- by-play for Rogers Sportsnet. After one season of this arrangement, from October 2009 until present, Ball handles all play-by-play duties while Shorthouse is calling games on Sportsnet. Kenward only calls games when Shorthouse is on Sportsnet and Ball is away calling BC Lions CFL football games. =TSN Radio 1040's secondary station= On November 5, 2009, station management announced the immediate discontinuation of CFUN's talk format and its replacement with sports radio.A message from James Stuart - Vice President & General Manager of CHUM Radio Vancouver , CFUN website, 2009-11-05, accessed 2009-11-05 CFUN, rebranded \\"Team 1410\\" (and eventually re-called CFTE), would henceforth serve as CTVglobemedia's secondary sports radio station for the city, primarily featuring ESPN Radio and other syndicated sports talk shows, BC Lions football coverage, replays of Vancouver Canucks games, and coverage of various American or overseas sports events not previously available on Vancouver radio. TSN Radio 1410 was also the home of the Major League Soccer team Vancouver Whitecaps FC. During the annual IIHF U20 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship, TSN Radio 1410 also broadcast Team Canada's games. Meanwhile, CKST continued to air its locally focused sports format. With the loss of Vancouver Canucks and Toronto Blue Jays rights to CKST/CFTE's new rival, Rogers-owned CISL, Bell's need for a secondary sports station in the area diminished. The company announced on April 18, 2018 that CFTE would re- launch as BNN Bloomberg Radio on April 30, 2018. CKST absorbed much of CFTE's remaining live sports content. = Re-branding as TSN Radio = On August 28, 2014, it was announced that both Team stations in Vancouver would rebrand as TSN Radio stations on September 8, 2014. The move coincides with Don Taylor's full-time return to the station after being released from rival Sportsnet. In 2017, after having CKST as their radio home for 11 years, the Vancouver Canucks moved to Rogers-owned CISL for the 2017-18 season. Programming The station offers a mixture of live sports broadcasting, with talk shows featuring either local personalities or simulcasts of syndicated sports radio shows. CKST broadcasts all games of the BC Lions, select games of the Vancouver Giants and occasional Vancouver Canadians games as well as other local sports events. It carries most Seattle Mariners games from KIRO in Seattle, most Seattle Seahawks games from KIRO in Seattle, ESPN Radio's Sunday Night Baseball, and Westwood One's Sunday Night Football and Monday Night Football. It was the official broadcaster of the BC Lions until November 2009 when coverage was moved to sister station Team 1410. It is now once again the official broadcaster of the BC Lions. It is a Fox Sports Radio affiliate and former ESPN Radio and Sporting News Radio affiliate. It also carries content such as Prime Time Sports, occasional Toronto Blue Jays games, and annual events such as the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships from The FAN 590 in Toronto. =Live Sports= TSN Radio 1040 is the flagship station and exclusive broadcaster of the following teams: * BC Lions (Canadian Football League) TSN Radio 1040 also features live coverage of the following: * National Football League (select games) * Seattle Mariners (Major League Baseball) (most games) * Seattle Seahawks (National Football League) (most games) References *Houston, William. \\"Mojo says goodbye to all-sports format,\\" The Globe and Mail, May 30, 2006. *Pap, Elliot. \\"Sports radio stations brimming with hockey coverage,\\" The Vancouver Sun, September 23, 2005. *Schecter, Brian. \\"Radio's Jock Talk Wars,\\" The Tyee, April 19, 2004. *Yu, Karl. \\"Jock Talk,\\" Vancouver Courier, April 14, 2005. *\\"Radio Station Fires Announcer For Comments Made About Vancouver Player's Wife,\\" Associated Press, February 5, 2003.

Each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio, then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the winner. The official rules of the contest have been changed and developed many times throughout the contest's history. Many of the rules cover technical aspects of the television broadcast itself. Rules affecting the conduct and outcome of the contest follow. General rules Countries that have a broadcaster that is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) are eligible to take part in the Eurovision Song Contest. Eligible participants include primarily Active Members (as opposed to Associate Members). Active members are those which are located in states that fall within the European Broadcasting Area, or are member states of the Council of Europe. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the \\"Euro\\" in \\"Eurovision\\" – nor does it have any relation to the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Australia since 2015, and Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. The broadcaster must have paid the EBU a participation fee in advance of the deadline specified in the rules of the contest for the year in which they wish to participate. The contest has a maximum number of 44 participants. Each year, the \\"Big 5\\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are guaranteed places within the final automatically, as well as the host broadcaster, typically the winner of the previous contest. The remaining (up to) 38 countries are then required to compete in one of the two semi-finals held in advance of the final. The number of participating countries has grown throughout the contest's history, and since the rules have been changed several times to both limit the number of finalists and to allow for participation by former Soviet and Yugoslavian republics, Warsaw Pact nations and others. Song Each country in the contest is entitled to enter just one song. At the first contest, each country was allowed to submit two songs each with a maximum duration of three minutes. Nowadays, it is still required that each song not exceed three minutes in length, although many artists record the song in a longer version, simply performing a shorter version at the contest. The entering song is also not allowed to be a cover version, and is not allowed to sample another artist's work. All songs must be completely original in terms of songwriting and instrumentation, and may not have been released publicly before 1 September of the year preceding. There has only been one incident of previously published music in a Eurovision event. When Switzerland debuted at the Junior contest in 2004, the singer, Demis Mirarchi won the national selection two years earlier. By the time the contest rolled by, the song had already been published. The EBU nevertheless accepted the submission by the broadcaster and Switzerland made their debut. =Language= From the first Contest in 1956 until 1965, and again from 1973 until 1976 there was no restriction on language. From 1966 until 1972, and again from 1978 until 1998, songs were required to be performed in a national language. The national language rule was actually instituted shortly before the 1977 Contest, but some countries had already selected non-national language entries, and they were allowed to enter without any changes. As of the 1999 Contest, the restriction was again lifted, and songs may be performed in any language. As a result, many of the songs are performed partially or completely in English. In 2003, Belgium made full use of the so-termed free language rule, and entered a song, \\"Sanomi\\", in an artificial language created especially for the song. This proved successful as the country finished second, only two points behind Turkey. The same tactic was used in 2006 by the Dutch entry Treble which is partially sung in an artificial language and once again by Belgium with their 2008 entry \\"O Julissi\\". Language issues and English-language prevalence Many European countries were founded on ideas of linguistic unity and, because of the sometimes unwelcome dominance of the English language in modern pop music, the language of a country's Eurovision entry can be a contentious issue.Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977) Some entries are performed in English to reach broader audiences, though this is sometimes looked upon as unpatriotic and likewise criticised by the British people for their country not doing well in the contest.http://www.open.edu/openlearn/languages/english- language/language-variety-all-disappears-the-eurovision-song-contest From 1999 to 2007, the number of non-English language entrants decreased, with mostly , Ex-Yugoslavia (mainly and ) and French language countries, , and performing in their native language. Until , the last wholly non-English language winner was Israel's Dana International, who performed Diva in Hebrew in . The 2004 winner, Wild Dances performed by Ruslana, was partially sung in Ukrainian. After , when Marija Šerifović won performing Molitva in Serbian, the number of non-English contestants increased again in 2008 – almost half of the performers contested in a native language of their country. The next non- English language winner, Amar pelos dois, performed in by Salvador Sobral, was sung entirely in Portuguese. In some cases, the lyrics are written and recorded in two different versions (usually English and a national language) or a single multi-language version. Examples include: * – Albania only allows songs performed in Albanian at Festivali i Këngës, the competition used to select their entry for the contest. They have often translated the lyrics of their entrant into English, as in , , and . * – the Danish national selection procedure allows freedom of language, but if the winning song from their national competition is in Danish, it must be re-written in English for the competition. * – The French entry in caused controversy as it was performed mostly in English, and many people were unhappy about being represented with an English song. Since then, , , and entries have been performed in both French and English. * – Iceland requires their artists to sing in Icelandic in the semi-finals of Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic selection process, but they may translate the song in the final. * – in the Sanremo Music Festival, used to select their entry for the contest, the song must be sung in Italian. The artist theoretically can choose to perform the song in English at Eurovision, but as of , no artist has chosen to perform their song at Eurovision entirely in English – at maximum, some stanzas were translated into English. * – Macedonia held a vote to decide whether should be in English or Macedonian. The song was performed in English. * – Though since 2017 different languages are allowed to compete in their national selection, as of 2020, all of their entries have been performed at least partially in Portuguese. * – after failing to qualify in 2017 with a song in English, since 2018 artists must sing in Serbian at their national selection. * – while it is not required for the winning entry of Melodifestivalen, the Swedish selection process, to be translated into English for Eurovision, it has usually been done so (if allowed in the rules), as in 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, and 2006. Performer Current rules state that countries are allowed to have up to six performers on stage. Performers must be aged 16 or older, on the day of the semi-final in the year of the Contest. The age restriction rule was introduced in 1990, as two contestants the year before had been 11 and 12 years old. From 1990 until 2003 the performer could still be 15 years old at the time of the contest, if their 16th birthday was later in the same year. In 2004 this was changed to the current rule. The introduction of this rule means that Sandra Kim, who was 13 when she won for Belgium in 1986, will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. The performer only needs to be 16 when the event takes place and not when they are selected, as proven when Lindsay Dracass was selected to represent the United Kingdom in 2001 and again when Triinu Kivilaan was selected to represent Switzerland in 2005, despite both of these performers only being 15 at their respective times of selection. In Dracass' case, she had to be issued a special visa to enable her to travel to Copenhagen.Terry Wogan, Eurovision Song Contest 2001 No restriction on the nationality of the performers exists, which has resulted in countries being represented by artists who are not nationals of that country. One of the most well-known winning artists was Canadian Céline Dion who represented Switzerland in 1988. Performance Artists shall perform live on stage, accompanied by a recorded backing-track which contains no vocals of any kind or any vocal imitations aiming at replacing or assisting the live/original voice of the Contestant(s). The Host Broadcaster shall verify respect for this rule. No entirely instrumental composition has ever been allowed in Eurovision contests. Norway won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1995 with a song focused on its instrumentals, but was eligible for participation because some lyrics (22 words in total) were added. Latvia performed their act a cappella in 2006, as did Belgium in 2011. Norway's entry in the 2010 Contest, and Austria's 2011 in the contest started a cappella but then the instruments started as well. After the 1998 contest, live music was abolished in Eurovision performances.http://www.andtheconductoris.eu/index.htm?content/eoh.htm Rule changes by year *' First contest – each of the seven competing countries were obliged to hold a national selection final to choose their entries. *' After Italy's song lasted 5 minutes and 9 seconds, rule changes were introduced to limit maximum song times to three minutes – which still operates. The voting was made public for the first time. Each of the ten jurors awards a single point to their favourite song - so in theory a country could be awarded all 10 points, although the highest tally allocated under this system was 9 by the Danish jury for France's winning song in and the Belgian jury for Ireland's winning song in . *' The convention of the winning country being invited to host the following year's contest is introduced. However, several countries declined the opportunity in subsequent years. *' Professional publishers or composers were no longer allowed in the national juries. *' The voting system changes. Each country had 10 jury members who awarded their three favourite songs 3, 2, and 1 points in order. Previously each of the ten jury members awarded 1 point to their favourite song. *' The jury size is doubled to 20 and the points awarded were 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. *' The jury size reverts to 10, and points are now 5, 3 and 1. It becomes possible for a unanimous jury to award all 9 points to one song – but this never occurred. It was also possible to give 6 and 3 points to two songs; this happened only in 1965, when the Belgian jury gave 6 points to the United Kingdom and 3 points to Italy. *' Countries must now sing in one of their national languages. *' The scoring system reverts to the one used between 1957 and 1961. *' Following a four-way tie in the 1969 contest, a tie-break rule was introduced with provision for a sing-off and a show of hands from the juries to elect a winner. *' Another voting system change is introduced. Each country had two jury members, one under 25 and one over 25. They each awarded 1 to 5 points for each song. This created an issue where some juries gave fewer points out than others. The rule permitting groups of up to six performers on stage was introduced. Previously, entrants could only perform solo or as a duet.http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by- year/contest?event=287 *' The rule forcing countries to sing in one of their national languages is relaxed – however this is only in place for four years. *' The scoring system used between 1957 and 1961 and between 1967 and 1970 is restored for a third time. *' A scoring system reminiscent of the current system is introduced. Each jury would now give 12 points to the best song, 10 to the second best, then 8 to the third, 7 to the fourth, 6 to the fifth and so forth until the tenth best song received a single point. Unlike today, the points were not announced in order (from 1 up to 12), but in the order the songs were performed. *' As the cost of staging the contest increases, a new rule was introduced that, in future, each participating broadcaster would have to pay a part of the cost of staging the contest. *' Countries must again revert to singing in their own national languages. *' The jury spokesperson now read the points out in numerical order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12) rather than in song order. *' As the number of countries reached a record of 22, the EBU imposed a limit on the number of countries competing. Although set at 22, this limit has varied slightly over the years. *' Following the closeness of the result at the contest, the tie break rule was amended. If a tie was to occur the winner would be declared by whichever received the most 12 points; if that still failed to separate them, the one with the most 10 points would be declared the winner. If there is still a tie, the same process is used with the 8 points, and so on until there is no longer a tie. *' Following Sandra Kim's win for at the age of just 13 and controversy over two performers in 1989 being just 11 and 12 years old, a restriction on the competitors' ages was introduced. The minimum age is now 16 at the time of the event. *' After the breakup of Yugoslavia, a pre-qualifying round was introduced. *' Relegation had to be introduced to accommodate the ever- increasing number of countries wishing to compete. Initially the bottom five countries from 1993 would not be relegated from 1994 contest. The relegation rules would change slightly over subsequent years. *' After controversy over a pre-selection procedure (similar to 1993) which resulted in being omitted from the contest, the selection procedure changed to allow only the countries with the best average scores over the previous four years. *' Televoting was trialled in five countries and would become the preferred method of voting from . *' Restrictions are lifted again allowing countries to sing in any language. *' The use of a live orchestra was dropped as a way to conserve money for the show; since then, all songs have used pre-recorded backing tracks. *' The \\"Big Four\\" rule is introduced giving France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom automatic entry in the contest regardless of previous performance. In , Italy returned to the competition, becoming a \\"Big Five\\" member. *' Relegation rules, which had varied slightly since 1994, were dropped and a semi-final was introduced. Countries eliminated in the semi- final were still allowed to vote on the final, so the convention of reading the scores in both French and English was dropped. The spokesperson would now read the score in one language with presenters repeating in the other language. *' Jury spokespersons no longer read out all the points from 1 up to 12. Instead the scores up to 7 points are displayed briefly before the spokesperson reads out their 8, 10 and 12 point allocations. *' With a record entry of 43, a second semi-final was introduced. Juries were used to allocate a wild-card place in the final from each of the semi-finals. 25 countries now compete in the final. *' After criticism of the voting system after the contest, changes in the voting procedure were made with the re-introduction of a national jury alongside televoting (split 50/50). This format would be extended to the semi-finals in 2010. *' Televoting is open from the first song until the end of the voting. *' The 15-minute televoting window is restored due to criticism of the voting method after the 2011 contest. 26 countries now compete in the final, due to Italy's return in 2011. *' The format of the jury/televoting result is changed slightly in that all songs are now ranked instead of being given a score in each method. This is then merged and the ten highest ranked songs receive points in the usual manner. Also, for the first time, the running order in all three shows is determined by producers of the show instead of a random draw, which is supposed to give each song competing a fair chance of success. * ' The EBU considers the possibility of inviting countries outside of the European Broadcasting Area or the Council of Europe to participate in future editions of the contest. The first of such \\"guest nations\\" was Australia in 2015. This also increases the number of countries competing in the final to 27. * ' A new voting system is introduced. Entries now receive one set of points from the jury and one set of points from televoting. First, the jury votes are announced in the usual way, giving 1 up to 12 points but with only the 12 points being read by the spokesperson. Then, the televotes are read by the presenters, starting with the country receiving the fewest televote points and ending with the country that received the most televote points, so the winner is not known until the end of the show.SVT Article, 20 Feb 2016 (Swedish) In addition, the number of countries competing in the final is reduced back to 26 as Australia now competes in the semi- final. * ' The voting system changes slightly, as now the order of the televoting changes. Instead of giving the televoting results in order of fewest to most points, the points are given in the order of the final jury voting ranking, meaning the country with the fewest jury points receives its televote points first, and the winner of the jury votes hears its final score last.

It was established in 1999. Eftel offers a range of services including: DSL and dial-up Internet access, web hosting and telephony services - to the retail, corporate and wholesale telecommunications markets. Eftel's services are delivered through a nationwide network of points of presence in all capital cities and regional areas around Australia. The network architecture and technology allows for the supply of voice, data or video services simultaneously; giving the capability to supply local and long-distance calls, high-speed data, Internet and video conferencing services to its customers. In 2013, Eftel was acquired by the rival M2 Group (now Vocus Group) for approximately $44.1 million. The company and its former subsidiaries, including aaNet and ClubTelco now operate as brands of M2. History 1999 Datafast commenced as a trunked radio network operator in Victoria. From 1999 to 2001, it developed a 34Mbit/s ATM backbone network in western Victoria. Ultimately the network extended to Mount Gambier in South Australia, with a hub in Melbourne and links to other state capitals. 2000 Eftel started as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) based in Perth, Western Australia. 2001 Datafast acquired a VoIP (Voice over Internet Provider) telecommunications company, and VivaNET, a wholesale only ISP. 2002 Datafast merged with Eftel, an ISP and broadband telecommunications carrier. The merger doubled the size of the company, providing significant economies of scale, and extended broadband operations into four states. 2003 Through consolidation and other initiatives, Datafast significantly reduced its networking costs, established a Layer-2 ADSL service, and extended the network to South Australia and the Northern Territory. These initiatives helped the company to take advantage of two current trends: industry consolidation and the take-up of broadband Internet access. In late 2003, Datafast acquired ISPs KeyPoint, EZ Web, and Impaq. These purchases raised the size of the customer base to 85,000 and extended broadband coverage to Tasmania, completing the national roll-out. 2004 In January 2004, Datafast acquired NSW ISP Planet Netcom, adding a further 15,000 accounts and bringing the total customer base to over 100,000, making the company one of Australia's 10 largest ISPs. In June 2004, Datafast acquired Bunbury based ISP OzzieNet, and in October Datafast acquired Affinity, a Melbourne-based ISP and its umbrella of brands, taking the total number of active accounts on the Datafast network to 120,000. 2005 Acquired ViaNetAIP and MyAccess. Launched Speak voice product, packaged retail product range and Broadband over PowerLines (BPL). Datafast Telecommunications Ltd changes name to Eftel Limited. 2006 Acquired aaNet, a specialist broadband provider.

Datafast Telecommunications Ltd changes name to Eftel Limited. 2007 Eftel became the first company in Australia to announce a VDSL2 rollout. The technology will enable theoretical speeds of up to 100Mbit/s, about 4 times faster than ADSL2+. However, as of October 2009, the VDSL2 rollout is still at the \\"expressions of interest\\" stage with no services in active operation; the aaNet VDSL2 EOI page can be seen here. http://www.aanet.com.au/vdsl_news 2011 Eftel completed a merger with ClubTelco a premium consumer focused telecommunications company that rewards its members with a range of benefits. This merger has seen the company double in size. In August 2011, Eftel acquired wholesale telecommunications service provider Platform Networks Pty Ltd. Platform Networks is a Sydney- based growing wholesale aggregator. 2012 In June 2011, Eftel announced the acquisition of the corporate and residential customer bases of West Australian Networks (www.westnet.net.au).

The AMM is one of many missions under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.\\"EU, Asian peace monitors arrive for Aceh mission\\" - Forbes Establishment of AMM The Aceh Monitoring Mission, led by Mr Pieter Feith from the EU, was established to monitor the implementation of various aspects of the peace agreement set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in August 2005.A detailed account of the negotiations, including discussions of the arrangements for monitoring the MoU, is set out in Hamid Awaludin, Peace in Aceh: Notes on the peace process between the Republic of Indonesia and the Aceh Freedom Movement (GAM) in Helsinki, CSIS, Jakarta, 2009, translated by Tim Scott, . Hamid Awaludin, Minister for Law and Human Rights between October 2004 and May 2007, was leader of the Indonesian Government delegation for the negotiations. The European Union, together with five contributing countries from ASEAN (Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines and Singapore), Norway and Switzerland, provided monitors for the peace process in Aceh (Indonesia). Following a brief interim presence (IMP) after the signing of the MoU, the AMM was officially launched on 15 September 2005 covering an initial period of 6 months. It was later extended until December 2006 and continued work until 2012. The presence of AMM was based on an official invitation from the GoI and with the full support of the leadership of the GAM. The AMM undertook the mission to contribute to a peaceful, comprehensive and sustainable solution to the conflict in Aceh. This had been made all the more important by the tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004. In undertaking the mission, the EU and ASEAN fully respected the territorial integrity of Indonesia and saw the future of Aceh as being within the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. AMM was impartial by nature and did not represent or favour any of the parties. The Head of Mission reported to the Council of the European Union through the Political and Security Committee and to Javier Solana, Secretary General/High Representative of the Council of the EU on matters related to the AMM. He reported to the parties, the CMI, and the contributing countries on possible violations of the MoU. Objectives The objective of the AMM was to assist the GoI and the GAM in the implementation of the MoU. The AMM did not take on a negotiation role. It was agreed that should this be needed during the implementation process, it would be the responsibility of the two parties and the original facilitator (i.e. the chairman of the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI)). For the final period of its mandate from 15 September 2006 to 15 December 2006, the following tasks were undertaken: *investigation and ruling on complaints and alleged violations of the Memorandum of Understanding; *establishing and maintaining liaison and good co-operation with the parties. As part of the AMM's tasks the decommissioning of GAM armaments and the relocation of non-organic military and police forces was fully completed on 5 January 2006. In accordance with the MoU, the GAM handed over all of its 840 weapons to AMM and on 27 December 2005 it officially disbanded its military wing (TNA). Equally the GoI fulfilled its commitments by relocating its non-organic military and police. The number of police and military (TNI) forces remaining in Aceh were within the maximum strength of 14,700 for the TNI and 9,100 for the police, in accordance with the MoU. One of the difficulties underpinning the work of the AMM was that there is a history of conflict in Aceh. In 2012 \\"The Jakarta Post\\", for example, noted that 'Aceh has experienced 138 years of conflict and only 15 years of peace.'Nani Afrida, Unfinished reconciliation haunts Acehnese', The Jakarta Post, 27 February 2012. =Human rights= The AMM has also monitored the human rights situation, the process of legislative change and the reintegration of GAM members. The Law on the Governing of Aceh was enacted by the National Parliament (DPR) on 11 July 2006 and signed by the President of Indonesia on 1 August 2006. Through discussions facilitated by AMM, the parties to the peace process consensually agreed that there were no disputed amnesty cases under the MoU. As a response to the positive progress of the peace process and the firm commitment by the parties the AMM, reduced its number of monitors in Aceh. From 15 September 2006, the mission functioned in a configuration of 36 monitors. The AMM district offices closed down in September 2006. Thereafter, mobile monitoring from Banda Aceh was available for deployment throughout Aceh as necessary. The mission comprised personnel with expertise in the whole range of competencies needed to fulfil the tasks of the activity. AMM was a civilian and not a military mission. Its members did not carry weapons. Some monitors had a military background because this was necessary to perform certain technical monitoring tasks. All monitors wore recognisable white shirts with AMM logo. Monitors conducted their monitoring tasks by patrolling and communicating with both parties, and by carrying out inspections and investigations as required. The mission continued work until mid-2012. The activity was formally completed in May 2012 although the EU announced commitments to further support for development projects in Aceh in other sectors such as environment and climate change activities.Hotli Simandjuntak, '[EU ends peace monitoring program in Aceh'], The Jakarta Post, 25 May 2012. See also 'Editorial: Thank You, EU', The Jakarta Post, 28 May 2012. Costs The costs of the mission were financed from the EU budget (EUR 9.3 million) and by contributions of member states of the European Union and participating countries (EUR 6 million).

Early life  Dabney Herndon Maury was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia. His descent is from the old Virginia families of Brooke and Minor, and the Huguenot emigrees, the Fontaines and Maurys. Dabney was the son of Naval Lieutenant John Minor Maury, who died of yellow fever in the West Indies when Dabney was two years old. He was brought up by his uncle, Matthew Fontaine Maury, who is noted as \\"Father of Modern Oceanography and Naval Meteorology\\". He studied law in Fredericksburg and graduated from the University of Virginia in the class of 1841 and then finished his studies at the United States Military Academy in 1846 and was brevetted as a second lieutenant in the Regiment of Mounted Rifles. Maury served in the Mexican–American War at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, and suffered a painful wound that almost resulted in the amputation of his arm. He was soon sent home to recuperate and was brevetted to First Lieutenant for bravery. His gallantry in this event prompted the citizens of Fredericksburg and the Legislature of Virginia to honor him with a special presentation sword. After further convalescence in White Sulphur Springs, he was reassigned to West Point as an instructor, serving in that capacity from 1847 until 1852. He then returned to active field duty with the Mounted Rifles, serving in the Oregon Territory, then on the Texas frontier. He returned East and commanded the Cavalry School at the Carlisle Barracks in 1858. He authored a book, Tactics for Mounted Rifles, which became the standard textbook. He also wrote Recollections of a Virginian in the Indian, Mexican, and the Civil Wars.  American Civil War  Maury's flag as commander of the Department of the Gulf, 1864 When the Civil War began, Maury was the Assistant Adjutant General in the New Mexico Territory, based in Santa Fe. Hearing the news of the firing on Fort Sumter, he resigned from the United States Army and travelled back to Virginia. He entered the Confederate Army as a colonel, serving as an Adjutant General, then was Chief of Staff under General Earl Van Dorn. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and assigned to field command. Maury led a division at the Second Battle of Corinth, and was appointed major general in November 1862. He participated in army operations around Vicksburg, Mississippi, and in the defense of Mobile, Alabama. In the latter military campaign, Maury commanded the Department of the Gulf.  Later life  With the conclusion of the Civil War, Maury came home to Virginia and established an academy in Fredericksburg to teach classical literature and mathematics. He moved to New Orleans, where a business venture failed and he returned to Virginia. In 1868 he organized the Southern Historical Society, based in Richmond. D. H. Maury spent 20 years working for the Southern Historical Society that produced 52 volumes of Southern history and genealogies. Two years after his wife died, Maury began a movement in 1878 to reorganize the National Militia. He authored a treatise entitled Skirmish Drill for Mounted Troops in 1886. Maury, appointed by President Cleveland, served as Minister to Colombia from 1887 to 1889. General Maury died at the home of his son (Dabney Herndon Maury Jr.) in Peoria, Illinois, and his remains were interred in the Confederate portion of the city cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

His field of research is in fluid mechanics, chemical engineering and complex fluids. Career Stone completed his undergraduate studies at University of California at Davis and earned his Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology under the direction of L. Gary Leal. He joined Princeton in 2009 after twenty years of professorship at the School of Engineering at Harvard University, and after spending one year as a post- doctoral fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University. His research has been concerned with a variety of fundamental problems in fluid motions dominated by viscosity, so- called low Reynolds number flows, and has frequently featured a combination of theory, computer simulation and modeling, and experiments to provide a quantitative understanding of the flow phenomenon under investigation. Research contributions Stone's studies have been directed toward heat transfer and mass transfer problems involving convection, diffusion and surface reactions. He has made contributions to a wide range of problems involving effects of surface tension, buoyancy, fluid rotation, and surfactants. He has also studied problems concerning the flow of lipid bilayers and monolayers, and has investigated the motions of particles suspended in such interfacial layers. His research on surfactants has important implications for the dispersal of hydrocarbon pollution in aquatic environments. Recent research has extended his study of fluid dynamics and flow within microchannels to biological applications as well. In 2016 he published 54 papers in first class journals. Honors and awards Stone is also committed to undergraduate education and outreach to the general public. In 1994 he received both the Joseph R. Levenson Memorial Award and the Phi Beta Kappa teaching Prize, which are the only two teaching awards given to faculty in Harvard College. In 2000 he was named a Harvard College Professor for his contributions to undergraduate education. Currently he also serves as an Academic Athletic Fellow for the Princeton University women's basketball team. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2003. He was the first recipient of the most prestigious fluid mechanics prize, the Batchelor Prize 2008, for best research in fluid mechanics in the last ten years. Stone was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2009, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2014.

Area Denial Artillery Munition (ADAM) is a family of United States land mines and 155 mm artillery projectiles. The mines carried by these projectiles are the M67 long-duration anti-personnel mines and M72 short-duration anti-personnel landmines intended to maim or kill enemy combatants. The duration refers to the self-destruct time, which is set at the time of manufacture to 4 or 48 hours. Once the mine lands, it launches seven tripwires before arming itself. Any disturbance of the tripwires will trigger the mine. The mine is entirely electrically detonated, if the battery level of the mine drops below a pre-set level - the mine self-destructs. Even if the mine does not self-destruct, the battery will fully discharge after 14 days, rendering the mine inactive. The mines contain a spherical warhead in a void that also contains 51 g of M10 liquid propellant. The void allows the propellant fluid to settle under gravity in the correct position beneath the warhead so that the warhead is always launched in an upward direction irrespective of the initial orientation of the mine. Upon activation the spherical warhead is launched upward to a height of 1-2 m where it detonates, producing approximately 600 fragments travelling at a velocity of 900 m/s.

It ranges from northern Cape York in Queensland to Gosford in New South Wales, with a small and most likely introduced population in Hornsby Heights in Sydney. It is the faunal emblem of the City of Brisbane.Symbols used by Council. brisbane.qld.gov.au Description The dainty green tree frog is a slender, medium-sized frog, reaching a length of . It is a rich green on its dorsal surface, with a yellow ventral surface. It has a coarse, granular skin with bright orange eyes; some specimens have a light blue ring following the circumference of the eye. The posterior of the thigh is purple-brown or maroon and the tympanum is visible. In most specimens, a thin yellow or white line runs from its nostril to its eye, and this distinguishes it from the closely related red-eyed tree frog (L. chloris) and orange-thighed frog (L. xanthomera), which both lack this line. If this feature is lacking, the granularity of the dorsal surface and size (L. gracilenta is smaller) will separate it from both L. chloris and L. xanthomera. The fingers of L. gracilenta are three-quarters webbed, while the toes are fully webbed. Ecology and behaviour The dainty green tree frog is commonly found in vegetation emerging from the water in streams and swamps, often in temporary water. It is found in a range of habitats, including rainforest, woodland and forest. It is commonly found near human developments, in gardens or farms and often enters houses looking for insects. Due to its common occurrence on fruit and vegetable farms, particularly bananas, it is commonly transported around Australia with fruits or vegetables, frequently becoming a lost frog. This is common among many frog species, and is of concern due to the much faster rate at which it can spread disease. This species is usually seen after heavy rain during spring and summer. It breeds in flooded grassland and small ponds. The males will call during summer after rain, and the call is a long \\"waa\\" or \\"wee\\". Others describe the call as a long, growl-like 'aarrrc' repeated frequently. Males form noisy choruses during summer breeding season.\\" The eggs are laid in a clear jelly lump in water, and are attached to vegetation. Tadpole development takes about 14 weeks.

The other two are the Bundesnachrichtendienst (Federal Intelligence Service, BND), which is the foreign intelligence agency, and the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, BfV) which is the domestic civilian intelligence agency. The headquarters of the MAD are in Cologne, with twelve groups located in cities throughout Germany. These MAD groups are collectively known to be the Militärischer Abschirmdienst. The agency has about 1,300 military and civilian employees and in 2018 the budget was 95,627,540 €. Its full formal name is Bundesamt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst; formerly it was formally named Amt für die Sicherheit der Bundeswehr.  Duties  The MAD is part of the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces. As a domestic intelligence service, it has similar functions within the military as the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz and works closely together with the BfV. The main duties of the MAD are counterintelligence and detection of \\"anticonstitutional activities\\" within the Bundeswehr. Other duties include the protection of Bundeswehr properties from sabotage and foreign espionage. Members of the MAD are also involved in planning and construction of buildings with high security requirements. The MAD has no prosecution power. The lead agency for the German military intelligence operations as well as strategic defense-related intelligence is the Bundesverteidigungsministerium (Ministry of Defense) in Berlin. The legal basis for the MAD is the MAD Law of December 20, 1990,Federal Official Gazette (BGBl) I pp 2954, 2977 as amended by Article 8 of the law of April 22, 2005.Federal Official Gazette (BGBl) I p 1106.  Organization  As well as a department for administrative affairs, there are the following specialist departments: * Department Z: Central services * Department E: Counter-extremism and counter-terrorism * Department S: Counterespionage and operative security * Department IV: Protection of secrets (personnel and material) * Department V: Technology The 12 regional offices are in: * Amberg * Hannover * Hilden * Kiel * Koblenz * Leipzig * Mainz * Munich * Rostock * Schwielowsee * Stuttgart * Wilhelmshaven  History  The MAD developed out of a liaison office between the Allies and the German government and was founded in its present form in 1956, after the Bundeswehr was created. Until 1984, its headquarters was called \\"Amt für Sicherheit der Bundeswehr\\" (ASBw, Federal armed forces office of security). As of September 1984, on the basis of the Höcherl report, the service was restructured and more civilian positions were created. The MAD had 7 groups and 28 regional offices after the former East German army, the NVA (the National People's Army), was incorporated into the Bundeswehr in October 1990. This was reduced to 14 offices in 1994 when there was a reduction of the armed forces.  Scandals  The MAD has been involved in a number of scandals, one of them was the secret surveillance of the home of the secretary of then minister of defence Georg Leber. This was done without Mr. Leber's knowledge. His secretary was suspected of espionage for the East German Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Ministry of State Security or Stasi). The suspicions turned out to be false. Leber was informed of the illegal surveillance at the beginning of 1978 but did not inform the Bundestag until the magazine Quick published an article on 26 January 1978. Georg Leber retired his position on 16 February 1978 taking sole responsibility for the surveillance scandal. He resigned against the wishes of then chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Another scandal was the Kießling Affair in 1983, when the MAD investigated Günter Kießling, a Bundeswehr four-star general working with NATO (Commander of NATO land forces and Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe.). The general was deemed to be a security risk based on allegations of homosexuality originating from questionable sources and was given early retirement by the then defence minister Manfred Wörner. The general was later rehabilitated. The affair had significant consequences for the service: the commander was removed, and a commission was set up under the former minister of the interior Hermann Höcherl (CSU). The Höcherl Commission investigated the way in which the MAD operated and made recommendations for improvement. These recommendations were implemented speedily.

It was the first Territorial formation to go overseas in 1914, garrisoning Malta, and then served with the 56th (London) Infantry Division on the Western Front (World War I) and in the North African and Italian campaigns in the Second World War. Origin The Volunteer Force of part-time soldiers was created following an invasion scare in 1859, and its constituent units were progressively aligned with the Regular British Army during the later 19th Century. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. The West London Brigade was one of the formations organised at this time. Brigade Headquarters was at 93 Cornwall Gardens in Kensington and the commander was retired Lt-Gen Lord Abinger (subsequent commanders were also retired Regular officers). The assembly point for the brigade was at Caterham Barracks, the Brigade of Guards' depot conveniently situated for the London Defence Positions along the North Downs. The brigade's original composition was:Monthly Army Lists, 1889–1914. West London Brigade * 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Fusiliers * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Fusiliers * 3rd Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Middlesex Regiment * 11th (Railway) Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps * 17th Middlesex Rifle Volunteer Corps * Supply Detachment, Army Service Corps * Bearer Company, Medical Staff Corps Territorial Force This organisation was carried over into the Territorial Force (TF) created under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the West London Brigade becoming the 1st London Brigade in 1st London Division. All of the Volunteer Battalions in the Central London area became part of the all-Territorial London Regiment and were numbered sequentially through the London brigades and divisions:Martin.Money Barnes, Appendix IV.Westlake. 1st London Brigade * 1st (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (former 1st VB, Royal Fusiliers) * 2nd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (former 2nd VB, Royal Fusiliers) * 3rd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (former 11th Middlesex RVC, 3rd VB, Royal Fusiliers) * 4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (former 1st Tower Hamlets RVC, 4th VB, Royal Fusiliers, from East London Brigade) The 3rd Middlesex RVC and 2nd VB Middlesex Regiment became the 7th and 8th Battalions Middlesex Regiment respectively in the Home Counties Division, while the 17th Middlesex RVC became the 19th Battalion, London Regiment (St Pancras) in the 2nd London Division. Brigade HQ was at Friar's House, New Broad Street (the HQ of 1st London Division). On the outbreak of war in August 1914 the brigade commander was Colonel The Earl of Lucan, a former Regular officer. First World War The division was mobilised on the outbreak of the Great War in early August 1914 and, when asked to serve overseas (as, according to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, Territorial soldiers were not obliged to serve overseas), most of the men of the division volunteered. Those who didn't, together with the many recruits, were formed into 2nd Line battalions, the 2/1st London Brigade, part of 2/1st London Division, which later became 58th (2/1st London) Division. The battalions adopted the prefix '1/' (1/4th Londons, for example) to distinguish them from the 2nd Line battalions, which adopted the '2/' prefix (2/4th Londons). Troops during the Battle of Passchendaele carry a wounded man to the aid post. The terrain pictured and the battle examplified much of the fighting of the Great War. However, between November 1914 and April 1915, most of the battalions of the division were sent overseas either to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front or to overseas postings such as Malta (in the case of the 1/1st London Brigade) so as to relieve to Regular Army troops for service in France and Belgium and so, as a result, the 1st London Division was broken up. In early February 1916, however, the War Office authorised the 1st London Division to be reformed, now to be known as 56th (1/1st London) Division. Consequently, the brigade was reformed in France in February 1916, now as the 167th (1/1st London) Brigade, but with mostly different units, except the 1/1st and 1/3rd Londons (both original battalions of the brigade), and both the 1/7th and 1/8th battalions of the Middlesex Regiment, both of which had previously been part of the Middlesex Brigade of the Home Counties Division and had served in Gibraltar before returning to England and fighting in France. The brigade served for the rest of the First World War in the trenches of the Western Front in Belgium and France, fighting a diversionary attack, alongside 46th (North Midland) Division, on the Gommecourt salient, to distract German attention away from the Somme offensive a few miles south in July 1916. In March 1917, the 56th Division pursued the German Army during their retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917, Arras, Langemarck, Passchendaele, Cambrai, First Arras, Albert and the Hundred Days Offensive. The First World War finally came to an end with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. By the end of the war the 56th Division had suffered nearly 35,000 casualties. =Order of battle= The brigade was composed as follows during the war: * 1/1st (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left May 1915, rejoined February 1916) * 1/2nd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left February 1915) * 1/3rd (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left May 1915, rejoined February 1916, left January 1918) * 1/4th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Royal Fusiliers) (left January 1915) * 1/7th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (from February 1916) * 1/8th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (from February 1916) * 167th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 22 March 1916, moved to 56th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 March 1918) * 167th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 14 June 1916) * 4th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment (from 7 October until 15 November 1917) Due to a shortage of manpower in the BEF, British infantry brigades serving on the Western Front were reduced from four to three battalions throughout early 1918. Therefore, the 1/3rd Londons were, in early January, transferred to 173rd (3/1st London) Brigade of 58th (2/1st London) Division where they absorbed the 2/3rd Battalion and were renamed the 3rd Battalion once again. In February the 1/1st Londons absorbed the 2/1st Battalion and were renamed the 1st Battalion. Between the wars Disbanded after the war, the brigade, along with the rest of the division, was reformed in the Territorial Army (formed on a similar basis to the Territorial Force) as the 167th (1st London) Infantry Brigade, again with the same composition as it had before the First World War, of four battalions of the Royal Fusiliers. The brigade had its headquarters in Birdcage Walk, London, at the Regimental Headquarters of the Scots Guards. In 1922 they dropped the 'battalion' from their title becoming, for example, 1st City of London Regiment (The Royal Fusiliers). Throughout the second half of the 1930s there was a need to increase the anti-aircraft defences of the United Kingdom, particularly so for London and Southern England. As a result, in 1935, the 4th City of London Regiment (The Royal Fusiliers) was converted into an artillery role, transferring to the Royal Artillery and converted into 60th (City of London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery and becoming part of 27th (Home Counties) Anti-Aircraft Group, 1st Anti-Aircraft Division (formed by conversion of the Headquarters of 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division). They were replaced in the brigade by the 10th London Regiment (Hackney) from the 169th (3rd London) Infantry Brigade. The battalion was previously known as the 10th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Hackney). After the 47th Division was disbanded the 56th Division was redesignated as the London Division and the brigade became 1st London Infantry Brigade. In 1938, after most of its battalions were posted away or converted to other units, the London Regiment ceased to exist and was disbanded. As a result, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions became the 8th, 9th and 10th battalions, respectively, of the Royal Fusiliers and the 10th London Regiment (Hackney) became the 5th (Hackney) Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment. In the same year the 10th (3rd City of London) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) was transferred to the Royal Artillery, becoming 10th (3rd City of London) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (69th Searchlight Regiment) but remained part of the Royal Fusiliers until 1940. In 1938 when all British infantry brigades were reduced to three battalions, in August, the 5th (Hackney) Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment was transferred to 161st (Essex) Infantry Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division and were replaced in the brigade by the London Irish Rifles (Royal Ulster Rifles) from 3rd London Infantry Brigade, previously the 18th London Regiment (London Irish Rifles) and, in 1908, the 18th (County of London) Battalion, London Regiment (London Irish Rifles). Again in 1938 the division was converted and reorganised as a motorised infantry division. Second World War The Territorial Army, and therefore the brigade and the rest of the division, was mobilised between late August and early September 1939, and the German invasion of Poland began on 1 September, and the Second World War officially began two days later, after Britain and France declared war on Germany. Mobilised for full-time war service, the brigade was brought up to War Establishment strength in late October 1939 with large drafts of militiamen, men had been called up earlier in the year with the introduction of conscription in the United Kingdom and had just completed their basic training. The division was destined not to be sent to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but instead remained in the United Kingdom under Home Forces in a home defence role and was sent to Kent in April 1940 to come under command of XII Corps. Like most of the rest of the British Army after the events of Dunkirk, the division spent most of its time in an anti-invasion role training to repel an expected German invasion. In July 1940, after receiving the 35th Infantry Brigade from the recently disbanded 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division, the division was reorganised as a standard infantry divisionJoslen, p. 37. and later in the year, on 18 November, the division was redesignated and converted into the 56th (London) Infantry Division and, on 28 November, the brigade was renumbered again as the 167th (London) Infantry Brigade. In the same month the 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles was transferred to 168th (London) Infantry Brigade and was replaced by 15th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, a hostilities- only battalion raised only a few months before, making the brigade, temporarily, an all-Royal Fusiliers brigade. However, the 15th Fusiliers were posted elsewhere in February 1941 and replaced by 7th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a battalion created in September 1940, by the redesignation of 50th (Holding) Battalion. In November 1941 the brigade was sent to Suffolk and in July 1942 was preparing for a move overseas and was inspected by General Sir Bernard Paget, at that time Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, and also His Majesty King George VI. The 56th Division, now composed largely of a mixture of Territorials, Regulars and wartime volunteers, left the United Kingdom on 25 August 1942, moving to Iraq and, together with 5th Infantry Division, became part of III Corps under the British Tenth Army, came over underall control of Persia and Iraq Command. The brigade left for Egypt on 19 March 1943 and covered the journey by road, arriving there on 19 April 1943, and was then ordered to Tunisia, a distance covering about 3,200 miles.Joslen, p. 228. The division came under command of X Corps, part of the British Eighth Army, and saw only comparatively minimal service in the Tunisia Campaign, which ended in mid-May 1943 with the surrender of over 230,000 German and Italian soldiers, a number equal to Stalingrad the year before, who would later become prisoners of war. However, the 167th Brigade had been blooded, and all three battalions had suffered over 100 casualties each. Unable to see service in Operation Husky (the Allied invasion of Sicily), the brigade was destined to see almost two years service mountain warfare in the Italian Campaign and began training in amphibious warfare. Men of the 9th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers manning a PIAT during the Battle of Salerno, 10 September 1943. Now under command of Lieutenant General Mark Wayne Clark, the youngest three-star general in the U.S. Army, and his U.S. Fifth Army, the 167th Brigade, with most of 56th Division (minus the 168th Brigade, temporarily replaced by 201st Guards Brigade), landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, D-Day, where they were involved in tough fighting almost from the landing, with the 8th Royal Fusiliers in particular being battered by German Tiger tanks. Throughout the fighting the brigade, supported by A Squadron of the Royal Scots Greys, had suffered heavy casualties (roughly 360 per battalion)Blaxland, p. 34. and, after being relieved by other units, secured the Salerno beachhead and later advanced up the spine of Italy, crossing the Volturno Line and later fought at Monte Camino and crossed the Garigliano river in January 1944. With the rest of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), however, the brigade, by now very tired and below strength, was held up by the formidable German defences known as the Gustav Line (also the Winter Line). In January 1944, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill envisioned an attempt to outflank the Winter Line, by way of an amphibious assault near Anzio, to capture Rome, the current objective which was being fought for in the Battle of Monte Cassino. As a result, after fighting at the Bernhardt Line and crossing the Garigliano, the division was pulled out of the line, and was transferred to Naples, to come under command of U.S. VI Corps. Arriving at Anzio on 12 February,Joslen, p. 227. they were almost immediately involved in heavy combat in the Battle of Anzio in very tough and severe fighting to secure the beachhead, and sustained very heavy losses, which could not easily be replaced. In late March the division was relieved by the 5th British Division and moved to EgyptBlaxland, p. 71. to rest, refit, retrain and absorb replacements, after sustaining devastating casualties and enduring terrible conditions similar to those of the trenches of the Western Front during the Great War. By the time they were relieved, casualties in the brigade, and the rest of 56th Division, by now very weak, had been so severe that one unit, the 7th Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, were reduced to 60 all ranks, less than a company, from an initial strength of almost 1,000 officers and men. Both Royal Fusiliers battalions had also suffered heavy casualties. In particular was the case of the 8th Battalion when, on 16 February during a heavy counterattack, X Company, was reduced to only one officer and 20 men. All that remained of Y Company was merely a single officer and 10 other ranks, after being heavily attacked by German infantry and Tiger tanks, which had fought against the battalion at Salerno. The battalion had, overall, suffered nearly 450 casualties at Anzio, more than half the strength of the battalion. During the fighting on 18 February, the worst day of the counterattack, Second lieutenant Eric Fletcher Walters was killed and his son, Pink Floyd star Roger Waters, wrote a song in his memory–When the Tigers Broke Free–which describes the death of his father. The Gothic Line, August 1944 and the concept of Operation Olive. The dark blue arrows represent major Allied attacks. Whilst in Egypt the 167th Brigade, which had been reduced to less than 35% effective strength,D'Este, p. 515. and division were both reinforced and brought up to strength largely by retrained anti-aircraft gunners of the Royal Artillery who had been transferred to the infantry, and had now found their original roles largely redundant, due largely to the absence of the Luftwaffe. While they were there the brigade was inspected, again, by General Sir Bernard Paget, now Commander-in-chief (C-in-C), Middle East Command, and who had inspected the division nearly two years earlier, shortly before the 56th (\\"The Black Cats\\") departed for overseas service. A Churchill tank halts near infantry of 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles, of 167th Brigade of 56th Division, near Tanara, Italy, April 1945. The 56th Division, now commanded by Major-General John Yeldham Whitfield, returned in July to Italy, where they were inspected by another man who had also inspected them two years prior, H.M. The King George VI. Almost as soon as it arrived the brigade, now under Eighth Army command, found itself fighting on the Gothic Line, throughout the summer, in Operation Olive (where Eighth Army suffered 14,000 casualties, at the rate of nearly 1,000 a dayHoyt, p. 204.) at the Battle of Gemmano, where the brigade and division suffered particularly heavy casualties. Due to these heavy losses suffered by the division (nearly 6,000) in August and September and a severe lack of British infantry replacements in the Mediterranean theatre (although large numbers of anti-aircraft gunners were being retrained as infantry, they had only began their conversion in August and would not available until, at the earliest, October),Blaxland, p. 202. the 8th Royal Fusiliers and 7th Ox and Bucks were both reduced to cadres and transferred to the 168th (London) Brigade, which was being disbanded, with the surplus personnel of the 8th Royal Fusiliers transferring to the 9th Battalion and most of the men of 7th Ox and Bucks transferring to fill gaps in the 2/5th, 2/6th and 2/7th battalions of the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) of the 169th (Queen's) Brigade. They were replaced in the brigade by 1st Battalion, London Scottish and 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles, both from the 168th Brigade, although 1st London Irish had originally been with 167th Brigade at the outbreak of war. This, however, was not actually enough to keep them at full strength and the battalions were placed on a reduced establishment of only three rifle companies. With the autumn rains and the oncoming winter, and no hope of a successful offensive in either weather, the Fifth and Eighth Armies reverted to the defensive and began preparing for an offensive on the Germans in the spring, scheduled for 1 April 1945.Blaxland, p. 239. Argenta Gap showing the Allied lines of advance. In April–May 1945 the brigade and division, with the rest of 15th Army Group, took part in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, where the 56th Division fought alongside 78th Battleaxe Division in the Battle of the Argenta Gap. The offensive effectively ended the Italian Campaign, and the brigade ended the war in Austria with the Eighth Army. =Order of battle= 167th Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war: * 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (left 23 September 1944) * 9th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers * 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles (Royal Ulster Rifles) (left 4 November 1940, rejoined 23 September 1944) * 1st London Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 11 May 1940 until 27 November 1940, when renamed) * 167th (London) Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (28 November 1940, disbanded 8 January 1941) * 15th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (from 9 November 1940, left 13 February 1941) * 7th Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (from 14 February 1941, left 23 September 1944) * 1st Battalion, London Scottish (Gordon Highlanders) (from 23 September 1944) =Commanders= The following officers commanded 167th Brigade during the war: * Brigadier C.R. Britten (until 11 July 1941) * Brigadier J.C.A. Birch (from 11 July 1941 until 21 June 1943) * Brigadier C.E.A. Firth (from 21 June 1943 until 29 January 1944) * Brigadier J. Scott-Elliott (from 29 January until 27 October 1944, again from 7 November to 17 December 1944, and from 11 January 1945) * Lieutenant Colonel J.R. Cleghorn (Acting, from 27 October until 7 November 1944) * Lieutenant Colonel A.T. Law (Acting, from 17 December 1944 until 11 January 1945) Post-war The division was disbanded in Italy after the war in 1946. It was reformed in 1947 as the 56th (London) Armoured Division in the reorganisation of the Territorial Army. However, the 167th Brigade was not reformed until 1956 when 56th Division was rereganised as an infantry division once more. As 167 (City of London) Infantry Brigade it had the following organisation:Edwards, pp. 194–5. * Honourable Artillery Company (infantry battalion) * 8 Battalion, Royal Fusiliers * City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) (converted to infantry) * 332 Signal Squadron, Royal Corps of SignalsLord & Watson, p. 205. 56th Division was disbanded in 1961.

Some of the more well-known CGE models solved using GEMPACKHarrison, W. J. and K. R. Pearson (1996), \\"Computing Solutions for Large General Equilibrium Models Using GEMPACK\\", Computational Economics, vol. 9, pp. 83–127. are the GTAP model of world trade, and the MONASH, MMRF, ORANI-G and TERM models used at CoPS. All these models share a distinctive feature: they are formulated as a system of differential equations in percentage change form; however, this is not required by GEMPACK. Main features A characteristic feature of CGE models is that an initial solution for the model can be readily constructed from a table of transaction values (such as an input-output table or a social accounting matrix) that satisfies certain basic accounting restrictions. GEMPACK builds on this feature by formulating the CGE model as an initial value problem which is solved using standard techniques. The GEMPACK user specifies her model by constructing a text file listing model equations and variables, and showing how variables relate to value flows stored on an initial data file. GEMPACK translates this file into a computer program which solves the model, i.e., computes how model variables might change in response to an external shock. The original equation system is linearized (reformulated as a system of first-order partial differential equations). If most variables are expressed in terms of percentage changes (akin to log changes) the coefficients of the linearized system are usually very simple functions of database value flows. Computer algebra is used at this point to greatly reduce (by substitution) the size of the system. Then it is solved by multistep methods such as the Euler method, midpoint method or Gragg's modified Midpoint method. These all require solution of a large system of linear equations; accomplished by sparse matrix techniques. Richardson extrapolation is used to improve accuracy. The final result is an accurate solution of the original non-linear equations. This linearized approach, originally devised to solve medium-sized CGE models on early computers, has since proved capable (on modern computers) of solving very large models. Additionally it has lent itself to some interesting extensions, such as: a Gaussian quadrature methodDeVuyst, E. A. and P. V. Preckel (1997), \\"Sensitivity Analysis Revisited: A Quadrature-Based Approach\\", Journal of Policy Modeling, 19(2) pp. 175–185. of estimating confidence intervals for model results from known distributions of shock or parameter values; a way to formulate inequality constraints or non-differentiable equations as complementarities;Harrison, W. J., J. M. Horridge, K. R. Pearson and G. Wittwer (2004), \\"A Practical Method for Explicitly Modeling Quotas and Other Complementarities\\", Computational Economics, June 2004, Vol. 23(4), pp. 325–341. and a techniqueHarrison, W. J., J. M. Horridge and K. R. Pearson (2000), \\"Decomposing Simulation Results with respect to Exogenous Shocks\\", Computational Economics, Vol 15(3), pp. 227–249. to decompose changes in model variables due to several shocks into components due to each individual shock. The underlying numerical approach is complemented by several GUI programs that: ease viewing of large multidimensional arrays often found in CGE databases; manage complex (e.g., multi-period) simulations; and allow interactive exploration and explanation of simulation results.

Bremsnes essentially encircled the town of Kristiansund on the west, south, and east sides. The administrative centre of Bremsnes was the village of Bremsnes, where Bremsnes Church is located. History The municipality of Bremsnes was established on 1 January 1897 when the large municipality of Kvernes was divided into four municipalities: Kvernes, Kornstad, Eide, and Bremsnes. Initially, Bremsnes had a population of 2,917. On 8 July 1903, an uninhabited part of Bremsnes was transferred back to Kvernes. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Bremsnes municipality was dissolved. The Bolga and Valen areas on the island of Frei (population: 884) became a part of Frei Municipality. The Dale area on the island of Nordlandet (population: 963) was incorporated into Kristiansund Municipality. The rest of Bremsnes (population: 3,153) was merged with Kvernes Municipality and most of Kornstad Municipality to create the new Averøy Municipality. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Bremsnes, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.

Accomplishments According to news reports and websites,HighBeam as of January 2004 N'kisi had a vocabulary of about 950 words and used them in context, frequently in complete sentences, had approximated verb forms to maintain the correct tense (such as saying flied when not knowing the past tense of fly), and did not depend on learned phrases to communicate his thoughts. N'kisi was shown as being supposedly capable of understanding photographic images, naming objects (within his vocabulary) appearing in a photo and inventing new terms for things he does not know words for by combining other words, like \\"pretty smell medicine\\" for aromatherapy oils. One anecdote recounted by the primatologist Jane Goodall says that, upon meeting her in person after seeing a photo of her, N'Kisi asked, \\"Got a chimp?\\" It was claimed he demonstrated a possible sense of humor. Controversy There is controversy about whether parrots are capable of using language, or merely mimic what they hear. However, some scientific studies—for example those conducted over a 30-year period by Irene Pepperberg with a grey parrot named Alex and other parrots, covered in stories on network television on numerous occasionsAlex & Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process: Amazon.de: Irene Pepperberg: Englische Bücher—have suggested that these parrots are capable of using words meaningfully in linguistic tasks. N'kisi also took part in a published scientific study of telepathic abilities conducted by Rupert Sheldrake and the parrot's owner Aimee Morgana. The researchers who conducted the study claim the results present a statistically significant indication of ability, while the study has been criticized by skeptics.

The municipality existed from 1838 until 1965 when it was dissolved. The municipality included the Stavanger Peninsula and the land surrounding both sides of the Gandsfjorden, but not the area around the head of the fjord. It originally encompassed the land surrounding the city of Stavanger in the present-day municipalities of Randaberg and Stavanger (except the city of Stavanger) and part of the municipality of Sandnes. The main church for Hetland was Hetland Church (now named \\"Frue Church\\"). Upon its dissolution in 1965, the municipality had 24,173 residents. History 1855 map of the city of Stavanger. The municipality of Hetland surrounds the city, with Hetland Church located just outside the city. The parish of Hetland was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 July 1922, the northwestern district of the municipality (population: 1,256) was separated to form the new municipality of Randaberg. This split left Hetland with 10,167 residents. The port city of Stavanger was located along the Gandsfjorden, adjacent to Hetland and as the city expanded over the years, areas of Hetland were annexed to join the city. Such changes happened in 1867, 1879, 1906, 1923, and 1953. Also on 1 January 1912, a small area in Høyland municipality (population: 41) was transferred to Hetland. On 1 January 1965, there were many major municipal changes in Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On that date, Hetland municipality was dissolved and its lands were transferred to its neighbors. The parts of Hetland located east of the Gandsfjorden, namely the districts of Riska and Dale (population: 2,077) were merged into a much larger Sandnes municipality. The rest of Hetland, located on the west side of the fjord (population: 20,861) was merged into the municipality of Stavanger, greatly expanding its size.

The plan was the brainchild of Kurt Haller and an expert from Abwehr I-Wi (economic). The plan envisioned the use of an Abwehr agent to sabotage the North Scottish power station at Fort William. The agent chosen by Haller for Seagull I was an Irish POW, which helped form the details of the mission. In detail - the agent would parachute into the vicinity of Glasgow, Scotland where he would form a three-man operational sabotage group from his Irish friends based in the area. The target was to be the electric power station at Fort William and the hydroelectric production facility at Kinlochleven. Seagull I was later refined in June 1942 to operate in tandem with Operation Seagull II with both operations being controlled by radio. It was also planned for each sabotage team in Ireland and Scotland to liaise with each other via radio contact.  Military context  Operation Seagull I planning began after the failure of Operation Innkeeper (\\"Unternehmen Gastwirt\\" in German). It appears that Abwehr hoped the training of seemingly compliant Irish POW's who had previous military experience with the British Army would lead to success. Operation Seagull I was planned in tandem with Operation Seagull II; its genesis can be seen in the context of 1940 - 1941 Abwehr accomplishments in recruiting agents from Irish National POWs held at Stalag XX A (301) also known as \\"Friesack Camp\\". While the overall focus of the Abwehr was intelligence gathering, there was a great deal of latitude at the regional planning level in the Abwehr's structure. This led to a series of missions, such as the Seagull series, which with the benefit of hindsight appear to be entirely flawed.  Agents involved  The agent selected for Seagull I was Andrew Walsh aka \\"Agent Vickers\\". Walsh was a native of Fethard in County Tipperary, Ireland. He had been captured by the German Army sometime during the period 1940 - April 1941, most likely as part of the British Expeditionary Force active in France and he had been detained in Stalag XX A (301). At this camp he came into contact with fellow Irishmen, possibly including IRA volunteer Frank Ryan during his recruitment efforts for the Abwehr. Walsh was recruited by the Abwehr around early 1941 for training and preparation for the Seagull I mission. His training for this mission included an advanced radio course at the Abwehr school in Stettin, Germany. Following the completion of their training, both agents - Walsh for Seagull I and James Brady for Seagull II - were to fly to occupied Norway and prepare for their dropzone flight aboard a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 'Condor'.The 'Condor' was a converted version of the aircraft, especially tailored for the mission. Shortly before takeoff from Germany to Norway, Haller received a call from Abwehr II HQ in Berlin and was ordered to return to Berlin with both of the agents immediately. On arrival it was explained that prior to their takeoff to Norway, Walsh had confided to fellow POW Thomas Cushing that he planned to turn himself in to the police on landing in Britain. Both Walsh and Cushing were arrested by the Gestapo.It is likely that the communal flat where the Irish POWs were housed was under SD surveillance. It is also possible that Cushing informed on Walsh. All of the Irish POWs, except for John Codd, were to see internment in penal batteries, or concentration camps after this. For a description of the competing suggestions about what happened to them all, including Walsh & Brady see Mark M Hull 'Irish Secrets' page 355. After this, Operation Seagull I was permanently cancelled.  Involvement of the IRA  There was no involvement or prior knowledge of Operation Seagull by the IRA in Ireland, although it is possible that Frank Ryan, an IRA volunteer located/stranded in Germany, was aware of the mission.

Peixoto wrote, directed and took up a minor role in the film. Its musical score includes Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Alexander Borodin, Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev and César Franck. The single-handed achievement of a member of the well-to-do élite of 1920s Brazil, Limite became over the years almost a myth — its only copy being almost lost during the 1950s, were it not restored thanks to the personal efforts of two 1970s critics — and the object of various legends, many of them put into circulation by Peixoto himself. One such legend referred to a bogus complimentary article about the film (\\"A film from South America\\"), that had supposedly been written by Sergei Eisenstein and published, in English translation, in the trendy London magazine Tatler. Only after Peixoto admitted, shortly before his death, that he had himself written the supposed \\"Portuguese translation\\" of \\"Eisenstein's\\" article, was the general credence given to this legend in Brazil withdrawn.Limite mariopeixoto.com Nevertheless, the restoration of the surviving copy and renewed viewing in the 1970s and 1980s aroused interest in the actual movie. In 1988, the Cinemateca Brasileira named it the best Brazilian film of all time. In 1995 Limite was once again declared as such, according to a national inquiry held by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo. In 1996, director and producer Walter Salles found the hoard of documents and props that was to become the Mário Peixoto Archive in a stash at his firm VideoFilmes in Rio, where currently Saulo Pereira de Mello takes care of the original manuscripts and objects . Pereira de Mello also edits publications by and on Peixoto. Onde a terra acaba (\\"At the edge of the earth\\"), the title of one of Peixoto’s unfinished projects; is also the name of a 2001 documentary film on Peixoto, directed by Salles' former aide Sérgio Machado. Around the same period in which Limite was being planned and filmed, Mário Peixoto also began to write and publish. In 1931, he released a collection of poems called Mundéu (republished in 1996) which is characterized by a strong modernist accent and has a foreword by Mário de Andrade. In the same year Peixoto published, in a magazine called Bazar, three short stories and a play, that are part of a collection published by Saulo Pereira de Mello in 2004: Seis contos e duas peças curtas which also includes undated and up till then unpublished material written by Mário. In 2002, another collection of poems written between 1930 and 1960, Poemas de permeio com o mar was published. In 1933 Mário published, as a private edition, his first and only novel, O inútil de cada um (republished in 1996). From 1968 on Mário reworked his 1933 original, using it as a basis for an intended extended version that was to be divided in six volumes. So far only the first volume, O inútil de cada um – Itamar has been published, in 1984, through the personal intervention of Jorge Amado, with whom Mário had worked on one of his film projects. There are few publications in English on Mario Peixoto or Limite, described by French film historian Georges Sadoul as an \\"unknown masterpiece\\". In 2006, Michael Korfmann edited a volume that offers ten contemporary views regarding the genesis, aesthetic and reception of the film, gathering contributions by filmmakers and writers from Brazil, Great Britain and the United States including Walter Salles, Saulo Pereira de Mello, Carlos Augusto Calil, William M. Drew, Alexander Graf, Paulo Venancio Filho, Constança Hertz, Aparecida do Carmo Frigeri Berchior, Marco Lucchesi and Marcelo Noah as well as a rare article written by Mário Peixoto himself. In November 2010, a further restoration of Limite premiered in Brooklyn, New York.

It broadcasts on 730 kHz, with a power of 50,000 watts from a transmitter in Delta. Studios are located in the TD Tower in Downtown Vancouver. CKAC in Montreal, Quebec is the dominant Class A Canadian station on 730 AM. Format In November 2006, CHMJ adopted an all-day, every day \\"all traffic\\" format, becoming the first station in North America to do so. The station dropped rebroadcasts of Corus Network talk shows, and terminated its programming of university sports and Seattle Seahawks coverage. AM 730 only interrupts traffic reporting for news, weather, and commercials. History =CKLG= On February 3, 1955, Vancouver AM radio station CKLG, owned by Lions Gate Broadcasting Ltd., began transmitting at 1070 kHz on the AM band with a 1,000 watt transmitter. Originally, studios and transmitter were both located in North Vancouver. The radio station was controlled by the Gordon Gibson family, better known in logging circles (Gordon Gibson, Sr, \\"The Bull of the Woods.\\") In 1958, the station changed frequencies from 1070 kHz to 730 kHz and increased power to 10,000 watts. The transmitter site was moved at this time from North Vancouver to Delta. The station was sold to Moffat Broadcasting Ltd. in 1961, and in 1964 launched an FM sister station, the original CKLG-FM (now CFOX-FM), at 99.3 MHz. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, CKLG (also known as \\"LG73\\") played a variety of contemporary music, at times ranking as one of the most popular radio stations in the Vancouver market. In 1975, the station once again increased its transmitted power, raising it to the current 50,000 watts. The station's popularity declined in the 1980s and 1990s, as many music stations moved from AM to FM broadcasting, and in 1992, the Corus Radio Company (now Corus Entertainment) purchased Moffat's Vancouver radio properties. After a brief and unsuccessful attempt at a talk radio format from September 1993 to February 1994, CKLG AM 1994 TV Spot the station returned to a hit music format, which would last for the next seven years, despite new competition from FM station CKZZ, which originally began as a dance music station in 1991 before moving towards a more mainstream Top 40/CHR format in 1996. =CJNW= On February 1, 2001, at Midnight, after playing \\"I Will Remember You\\" by Sarah McLachlan,Seattle FM Dial - 1981 Corus changed the station's call letters to CJNW (the CKLG call sign was later transferred to Rogers Communications' CKLG-FM), and adopted a 24-hour news format referred to on-air as \\"NW2, all news radio, powered by CKNW\\". The hope was to leverage the Vancouver market dominance of sister station CKNW, in light of the success of Rogers' all-news station News 1130. CJNW's all-news format lasted for approximately 14 months, and was abandoned in light of lower than expected ratings. =Mojo Radio= MOJO Sports Radio On May 28, 2002, at 5 a.m., CJNW discontinued their all-news format and began a nearly 2 1/2 month-long stunt of modern rock music, which also included a month of down time for a transmitter site upgrade. On August 6, at 6 a.m., the station changed call letters once again to the current CHMJ, and flipped to a hot talk format branded as MOJO 730, Talk Radio for Guys, which was based on sister station CFMJ in Toronto. When that format failed to attract a large enough audience, the station changed to an all-sports format in February 2004, identified as MOJO Sports Radio, AM 730. It was the radio home of the Vancouver Giants, Vancouver Whitecaps, and various other local sports events including UBC Thunderbirds and SFU Clansmen football and basketball games. It also carried Seattle Seahawks games from Seattle's KIRO. It was an ESPN Radio affiliate and also shared some sports content with CKNW. Its main talk personalities were morning host John McKeachie and afternoon host Bob \\"The Moj\\" Marjanovich, both former hosts at CKST, a Vancouver all-sports station owned by CHUM Limited. MOJO competed heavily with The TEAM for ratings, personnel, and broadcast contracts, but continued to rank at the bottom of the BBM ratings, placing 17th of 17 stations surveyed in April 2006 with a 0.9 percent market share. =AM 730= 250px On May 30, 2006, CHMJ terminated its all-sports format, switching to a stunt of a series of promotional content. The station re-launched at 7:30 a.m. on June 5, 2006 with a new format described as \\"continuous drive-time traffic and the best of talk\\". Programming consisted of continuous traffic reports during the morning and afternoon peak periods and rebroadcasts of talk radio programming from CKNW. CHMJ also continued to provide play-by-play coverage of Vancouver Giants WHL hockey, Vancouver Whitecaps, and Seattle Seahawks NFL football. On November 26, 2006, the station dropped the talk show aspect of the format and became \\"All Traffic...All The Time\\"; it would also later discontinue the remaining sports coverage it carried over from its sports format. The station now carries virtually nothing but traffic reports and weather, making it a commercial highway advisory radio station.

The municipality existed from 1855 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located on both sides of the Malangen fjord in what is now the present-day municipalities of Tromsø and Senja. The administrative centre was located at Brensholmen on the western shore of the island of Kvaløya. Brensholmen is also the location of Hillesøy Church, the main church for the municipality. Hillesøy Municipality included about of land with on the island of Senja, about on the island of Kvaløya, and about of smaller islands including Hillesøya and Sommarøya. On Senja island, Hillesøy Municipality included the larger villages of Fjordgård, Husøy, and Botnhamn. On Kvaløya island, it included Ersfjordbotn and Brensholmen. The island of Sommarøya is connected to the large island of Kvaløya by the Sommarøy Bridge. Most of the other islands are only accessible by boat. History The municipality of Hillesøy (originally spelled Hillesø) was established in 1855 when it was separated from the large Lenvik Municipality (or it might have been in 1871–some sources do not concur). The initial population of Hillesøy was around 800 people. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Hillesøy Municipality was dissolved and its lands were divided as follows: *The areas of Hillesøy on Kvaløya as well as all of the islands north of the Malangen fjord (with 1,316 inhabitants in total) were merged with the city of Tromsø (population: 12,602), the whole municipality of Tromsøysund (population: 16,727), and all of the municipality of Ullsfjord except the Svensby area (population: 2,019) to form a new, enlarged Tromsø Municipality. *The areas of Hillesøy on the island of Senja and the little island of Hekkingen (with 1,159 inhabitants in total) merged with Lenvik Municipality (population: 8,825), the part of Tranøy Municipality along the south shore of the river Lakselva (population: 106), and the part of Sørreisa Municipality on Senja island (population: 129) to form a new, larger Lenvik Municipality. Name The municipality is named after the old Hillesøy farm () on the island of Hillesøya since that is where the Hillesøy Church was originally located.

She served briefly in the West Indies where she captured numerous small vessels. She was wrecked in 1804. Origins She had originally been laid down at Barnard's Deptford yard as an East Indiaman named Royal Admiral. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars resulted in a shortage of warships, which led the Navy Board to purchase five ships being built or serviced in commercial dockyards along the River Thames and to complete them as warships. Alongside Royal Admiral, the Navy acquired the merchantmen Belmont, Princess Royal, Earl Talbot and Pigot; they became , , , and respectively. As a 64-gun ship, York was a small third rate; this combined with her unusual build resulting from her conversion from a mercantile craft to a warship to make her a slightly ungainly and awkward ship. Career Captain John Ferrier commissioned York in April 1796. He then sailed her for the Leeward Islands on 4 January 1797. She spent much of her early career in the Caribbean Sea. On 8 February 1798, she captured the small American schooner Fancy near St Thomas. York had to fire 15 shots before the schooner hove to, and when the boarding party from York arrived, they found 12 French passengers aboard, who were in the act of throwing five bags of money overboard. York brought Fancy into Môle-Saint-Nicolas where she was condemned as a prize. Apparently she had also been carrying 25,000 dollars of gold hidden on board but that most of it had been smuggled ashore. In June–July 1799, York captured Santa Dorval, a Spanish packet boat, of four guns, 22 men, and 86 tons (bm). She was sailing from Vera Cruz to Havanna, and under the command of Lieutenant Don Joseph Bonefacio of the Spanish navy. , , , and were in company with York. Then in June 1799 York captured several merchant vessels: *Spanish schooner Jesus Maria, sailing from Jamaica to Porto Rico with a false pass, carrying provisions and sundries; *Schooner Christopher, under American colours, sailing from Arrcoa bound Baltimore with a cargo of coffee and tobacco (Dutch property); *Brig James, under American colours, sailing from Cape Francois to Philadelphia with a cargo of coffee and sugar (French property); *Brigs Harriot and Ann, under American colours, sailing from Cape Francois to Charleston with a cargo of coffee and sugar (French property); *Schooner Eliza, under American colours, sailing from Jeremie to Saint Augustine with a cargo of coffee and sugar. In July, York and captured or detained: *Brig Ariel, under American colours, sailing from Jeremie to Baltimore, with a cargo of 146,000 pounds of coffee; *Schooner Lydia, under American colours, sailing from Tauxillo (probably Trujillo, Honduras), to Havana with sugar and indigo; *Brig Romulus (detained), under American colours, sailing from Havanna to Charlestown, with 662 boxes of sugar; *Ship Flora, with Spanish and American papers, from Carthagena, Spanish Main, and bound to New York and Cadiz, with a cargo of cotton and fustick, and 81,000 dollars in gold (secreted); *Schooner Fair American, under American colours, sailing from Barracoa to Baltimore, with 183,000 pounds of coffee and 10,000 pounds of sugar. In late 1800, York captured Cronberg, Molder, master, which had been sailing from St Croix and Havana to London. York brought Cronberg into Jamaica.Lloyd's List, №4129, - accessed 13 December 2014. In 1801 York sailed back to Britain as escort to a convoy of 155 merchant vessels, all of which reached their destination safely. For his service the West Indian merchants thanked Ferrier and presented him with a piece of plate.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volumes 159-160 (1836), pp.545-6. York then served under Admiral Nelson in his unsuccessful attacks on Boulogne. On the night of 15 August the boats of the Third Division, under Captain Isaac Cotgrave, assembled on Yorks deck. They attacked but had to withdraw between 3 and 4am on the morning of 16 August. In the attack, the British lost five officers and men killed, and 31 wounded. Three of the dead and 16 of the wounded were from York. York was paid off and placed into ordinary in June 1802 at Woolwich. Between October 1802 and August 1803 she underwent repair and refitting at Deptford. Captain Henry Mitford recommissioned her in June 1803.Mitford was the eldest son of the historian William Mitford. Fate She departed Woolwich on 26 December 1803 for a routine patrol in the North Sea. She went missing and was presumed to have foundered with the loss of all hands. It appears that she struck Bell Rock () in the North Sea off Arbroath, and that this was the impetus for the building of the Bell Rock lighthouse three years later. Wreckage was found at Cruden Bay and St Coombs, both in Buchan, Aberdeenshire.Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: York: Bell Rock, North Sea, - accessed 13 December 2014.

He is best known as the expedition photographer and cinematographer for Robert Falcon Scott's Terra Nova Expedition to the Ross Sea and South Pole (1910–1913). In this role, he captured some of the most enduring images of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. Early life Ponting was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire in the south of England, on 21 March 1870. His father was a successful banker, Francis Ponting, and his mother was Mary Sydenham.Arnold, p. 7 From the age of eighteen Herbert was employed at a local bank branch in Liverpool, where he stayed for four years. That time was long enough to convince him that he did not wish to follow in the profession of his father, and attracted to stories of the American West, he moved to California where he worked in mining and then bought a fruit ranch in the 1890s. In 1895 he married a California woman, Mary Biddle Elliott; their daughter Mildred, was born in Auburn, California in January 1897. The Great Wall of China in 1907, photographed by Herbert Ponting. Ponting sold his fruit farm in 1898 and, with his wife and daughter, returned to Britain to stay with his family. When they returned to the USA he turned his long-standing hobby of photography into his next career. Following a chance meeting with a professional photographer in California, to whom he had given advice about the locality and showed his own photos, he entered his pictures in competitions and won awards; he also sent some of his stereoscopic photographs to companies who published them. His work was also selected for the first San Francisco Salon; at that time he was living in Sausalito, north of San Francisco. He took stereoviews of and reported on the Russo-Japanese war of 1904–05, and afterwards continued to travel around Asia, working in Burma, Korea, Java, China and India taking stereoviews and working as a freelance photographer for English-speaking periodicals. Improvements in the printing press had made it possible, for the first time, for mass-market magazines to print and publish photographic illustrations.Arnold, p. 8 After spending much of 1901-6 travelling around photographing in Asia, Ponting returned to Europe, where he continued to take stereoviews (including in Switzerland and Spain) and wrote illustrated articles for magazines including Country Life, the Graphic, the Illustrated London News, Pearson's, and the Strand Magazine. In the Strand, Ponting's work appeared side by side with the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, one of Ponting's contemporaries. Ponting expanded his photographs of Japan into a 1910 book, In Lotus-land Japan. He took extensive photographs in Spain.Las fotografías españolas de Herbert Ponting He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (FRGS). His flair for journalism and ability to shape his photographic illustrations into a narrative led to his being signed as expedition photographer aboard the Terra Nova, the first time a professional photographer was included on an Antarctic expedition. The Terra Nova and Antarctica As a member of the shore party in early 1911, Ponting helped set up the Terra Nova Expedition's Antarctic winter camp at Cape Evans, Ross Island. The camp included a tiny photographic darkroom. Although the expedition came more than 20 years after the invention of photographic film, Ponting preferred high-quality images taken on glass plates.

The primitive device, called a cinematograph, could take short video sequences. Ponting also brought some autochrome plates to Antarctica and took some of the first known color still photographs there. The expedition's scientists studied the behavior of large Antarctic animals, especially killer whales, seals, and penguins. Ponting tried to get as close as possible to these animals, both on the Terra Nova in the sea ice and later on Ross Island, and narrowly escaped death on one occasion in early 1911 when a pod of eight killer whales broke up the ice floe in McMurdo Sound on which he was standing. During the 1911 winter, Ponting took many flash photographs of Scott and the other members of the expedition in their Cape Evans hut. With the start of the 1911–12 sledging season, Ponting's field work began to come to an end. As a middle-aged man, he was not expected to help pull supplies southward over the Ross Ice Shelf for the push to the South Pole. Ponting photographed other members of the shore party setting off for what was expected to be a successful trek. After 14 months at Cape Evans, Ponting, along with eight other men, boarded the Terra Nova in February 1912 to return to civilization, arrange his inventory of more than 1,700 photographic plates, and shape a narrative of the expedition. Ponting's illustrated narrative would be waiting for Captain Scott to use for lectures and fundraising in 1913. Later life The catastrophic end of \\"Scott's Last Expedition\\" also affected Ponting's later life and career. When the Terra Nova had sailed south in 1910, it had left massive debts behind. It was expected that Scott would return from the South Pole as a celebrity and that he could use moving images from his expedition in a one-man show. Ponting's cinematograph sequences, pieced out with magic lantern slides, were to have been a key element in the expedition's financial payback. However, when the bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered in their tent on the Ross Ice Shelf in November 1912, their diaries and journals were also found. These records described the explorers' final days while suffering from exposure and malnutrition, and their desperate effort to get to a depot of food and fuel that could have saved them. Scott knew he was doomed, and used his final hours to write pleas to his countrymen to look after the welfare of the expedition's widows and survivors. The eloquent appeals, upon publication in the British press, wrung massive donations from the public. The gifts repaid the entire cost of the expedition, provided large annuities (carefully doled out by expedition status and rank) for the widows and survivors, and left a substantial surplus for eventual use as the startup endowment of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI), part of Cambridge University. Under these conditions, Ponting's Antarctic work took on a tragic overtone and became a memorial to Scott and his companions rather than a celebration. It was, however, used extensively in the press and exhibited at the Fine Art Society, Bond Street, shown in venues all over Britain and used in numerous lectures by Ponting and other expedition members (including at Buckingham Palace and the Royal Albert Hall). When World War I began Ponting tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade the War Office to make use of his skills as a photographer and war correspondent, but his age was cited as a reason for his being rejected for war service. Copies of his films of Scott were shown to soldiers at the front who were, according to an army chaplain, moved by the heroism of Scott and his men. With the conclusion of the war, Ponting's archive drew a nibble of interest. He published The Great White South, the photographic narrative of the expedition, in 1921 which was a popular success, and produced two films based upon his surviving cinematograph sequences, The Great White Silence (1924 - silent) and Ninety Degrees South (1933 - sound). He also lectured extensively on the Antarctic. These works brought him little personal recompense but he continued to work on inventions related to the 'movies', including a special effects machine which was used in the English language version of \\"Emil and the Detectives\\" (1935). Ponting died in London in 1935; his photographs were sold to raise funds to pay for medical and other expenses. The Scott Polar Research Institute purchased the Ponting Collection in 2004 for £533,000. In 2009, SPRI and publisher Salto Ulbeek platinum- printed and published a selection of the Collection. The Great White Silence was restored by the British Film Institute and re-released in 2011. During the period of the Scott expedition centenary (2010-3) his work was widely published and exhibited, reaching new audiences. In addition, one of Ponting's photographic darkrooms was reconstructed in the collections of the Ferrymead Heritage Park in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The poem, elaborating on a motif also found in the anonymously-authored Longfellow parody \\"The Modern Hiawatha\\" (ca. 1904), is recited for humorous effect in the film Scott of the Antarctic.

The plan envisioned in Seagull II was to use an Irish Abwehr agent (\\"V-Manner\\"), who would parachute into the area of south-east of Ballycastle in Northern Ireland, recruit a sabotage team from any willing IRA personnel in the area, and attack important \\"targets of opportunity\\" in the immediate vicinity. Both operations were to be controlled by radio and with each sabotage team in Ireland and Scotland liaising with each other via radio contact. Agents involved and failure of mission The agent selected for Seagull II was James Brady aka. \\"Agent Metzger\\". Brady was a native of Strokestown in Roscommon, Ireland who had been stationed in Norway with the British Army. He had been captured by the German Army after they occupied the Channel Islands on 30 June 1940. At the time of the invasion he had been in jail on Guernsey convicted of the attempted murder of a British police officer. Following his capture he was detained in Stalag XX A (301) where he came into contact with fellow Irishmen, possibly including IRA member Frank Ryan under his pseudonym \\"Mr. Richards\\". Brady was recruited by the Abwehr around mid 1941 and subsequently issued a South American passport under the identity of \\"de Lacy.\\" In preparation for the Seagull II mission Brady underwent a series of intensive Abwehr supervised training courses including a radio course at the Abwehr school at Stettin. Following the completion of their training both agents- Brady for Seagull II and Andrew Walsh aka. \\"Agent Vickers\\" for Seagull I were to fly to occupied Norway and prepare for their flight aboard a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor to their dropzone.The 'Condor' was a converted version of the aircraft, specially tailored for the mission. Shortly before takeoff to Norway, Haller received a call from Abwehr II HQ in Berlin who ordered him to return to Berlin with both of the Irish agents immediately. On arrival it was explained that prior to their takeoff for Norway, Andrew Walsh had been overheard confiding to fellow POW Thomas Cushing that he planned to turn himself into the police on landing in England after hiding the money the Abwehr had given him for operational funds. Cushing had informed on Walsh and both were arrested by the Gestapo.It is likely that the communal flat where the Irish POW were housed was under SD surveillance. For a description of what happened to Walsh & Brady see Mark M Hull 'Irish Secrets' page 355. After this, Operation Seagull I was permanently cancelled. Military context Operation Seagull II was planned in tandem with Operation Seagull I, its genesis can be seen in the context of 1940 - 1941 Abwehr successes in recruiting agents from POW Irish nationals held at Stalag XX A (301), sometimes referred to as \\"Friesack Camp\\". The overall focus of the Abwehr was intelligence gathering but there was a great deal of latitude at the regional planning level in the Abwehrs structure. This led to a series of missions which with the benefit of hindsight appear to be entirely flawed. The agent taking part in Seagull II would have found a rich target environment in Northern Ireland. The presence of US Army Troops from early 1942 onwards, and the activities of the RAF operating from the region would have presented targets the Abwehr were interested in hurting. However, IRA assistance in the operation may have been harder to come by. By 1942 the organisation had all but been destroyed in Éire, and the complete failure of the IRA Northern Command's Northern Campaign, (September - December 1942), demonstrated that the organisation was entirely curtailed by wartime restrictions, internment, and in Northern Ireland, the activities of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army. It is fair to say that Abwehr staff both at regional Ast level and in Berlin were largely unaware of the problems the IRA faced, and its overall ineffectiveness as an organisation or guerilla force. Involvement of the IRA There was no involvement or prior knowledge of Operation Seagull II by the IRA in Ireland, although it is possible that Frank Ryan, an IRA member located/stranded in Germany and working with the Abwehr, was aware of the mission.

It later spread beyond the United States, most prominently in the writings of the Black Consciousness Movement of Steve Biko in South Africa. Black is beautiful got its roots from the ' movement of the 1930s. Negritude argued for the importance of a Pan-African racial identity among people of African descent worldwide. It aims to dispel the racist notion that black people's natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly.Some notes on the BLACK CULTURAL MOVEMENT John Rock was long thought to be the first person to coin the phrase \\"black is beautiful\\"—during a speech in 1858—but historical records indicate that he never actually used the specific phrase on that day.The Journal of Negro History, Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Oct. 1969). pp. 405–406. The movement also encouraged men and women to stop trying to eliminate African-identified traits by straightening their hair and attempting to lighten or bleach their skin.Jamaica Says Black Is Beautiful Bill Allen, a freelance writer for advertising agencies, claimed he coined the phrase in the 1950s.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1989-05-07-8904100440-story.html This movement began in an effort to counteract the racist notion in American culture that features typical of Blacks were less attractive or desirable than those of Whites. Research indicates that the idea of blackness being ugly is highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as internalized racism.\\"Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective\\" by Chris Weedon, Cardiff University. gender forum no. 1: \\"In her novel The Bluest Eye (1970), Toni Morrison depicts the effects of the legacy of nineteenth-century racism for poor black people in the United States. The novel tells of how the daughter of a poor black family, Pecola Breedlove, internalizes white standards of beauty to the point where she goes mad. Her fervent wish for blue eyes comes to stand for her wish to escape the poor, unloving, racist environment in which she lives.\\" This idea made its way into black communities themselvesBlack is Beautiful\\" and the Color Preferences of Afro-American Youth\\", Claud Anderson, Rue L. Cromwell, The Journal of Negro Education, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Winter 1977), pp. 76–88. . and led to practices such as paper bag parties: social events which discriminated against dark-skinned African Americans by only admitting lighter-skinned individuals. History While the Black is Beautiful movement started in the 1960s, the fight for equal rights and a positive perception of the African-American body started much earlier in American history. This movement took form because the media and society as a whole had a negative perception of the African-American body as being only suitable for slave status.Cassandra Jackson, Violence, Visual Culture, and the Black Male Body (2011). The Black is Beautiful movement was based around a fight for an equal perception of the black body to help undo all the negative ideas brought about by a history based in white supremacy.Stephanie M. H. Camp, \\"Black Is Beautiful: An American History\\". Journal of Southern History 81#3 (2015): 675–690. The genesis of the movement was a fashion show titled, Naturally ’62 On January 28, 1962 by Kwame Brathwaite. The Grandassa Models at the show deliberately veered away from western concepts of beauty instead incorporating African imagery as a form of protest against \\"how, in Ebony magazine, you couldn’t find an ebony girl.\\" Naturally ’62 proved to be very popular with a crowd forming around the nightclub hosting it, the Purple Manor. It was also subject to controversy. Brathwaite's photos of black musicians, including Stevie Wonder and Bob Marley, would spearhead the movement into the public consciousness. More Naturally shows and adoption of African imagery by musicians such as Nina Simone lead to the looks shown to be normalised. Proving that Black is Beautiful has bled into fashion, where the idea is that dressing with sophistication in mind allows for one to command automatic respect from those around them. This is best exemplified in Black Dandyism, a male fashion movement best described through Monica Miller's book Slaves to Fashion. Since slaves were forbidden from wearing expensive or beautiful fabrics, dressing up the Black body has historically been a radical statement of self-hood and equality. Black Dandyism has morphed over the years, moving from simply dressing sharply in the fashion of the times to what is now the combination of dressing sharply and loud, African-inspired prints and colors that subvert notions of traditional masculinity. =Documentary= The \\"Black is Beautiful\\" movement is examined in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, No Lye: An American Beauty Story.

The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality was located in what is now parts of Alver Municipality and Osterøy Municipality in Vestland county. It originally covered all the lands on both sides of the Osterfjorden-Romarheimsfjorden from the Lonevågen fjord all the way east to the county border at the end of the Modalen valley. Hosanger also included an exclave on the Lindås peninsula surrounding the village of Seim at the southern end of the Lurefjorden. Seim was separated from the rest of Hosanger by part of Lindås Municipality. Over time, the areas of Seim and Modalen were split off from Hosanger. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Hosanger on the island of Osterøy, where Hosanger Church is located. History The parish of Hosanger was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1885, the exclave of Seim was separated from Hosanger and merged into the new Alversund Municipality. This left Hosanger with 3,387 residents. On 1 January 1867, the Øksendalen farm (population: 28) in the Eksingedalen valley was transferred from Voss Municipality to Hosanger by Royal resolution. On 1 January 1910, the eastern part of Hosanger (population: 821) which included the Modalen and Eksingedalen valleys was separated from Hosanger to form the new Modalen Municipality. The split left Hosanger with 2,524 inhabitants. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Hosanger was dissolved and its lands were divided as follows amongst its neighbors: *All of Hosanger located north of the Osterfjorden (population: 791) became a part of the enlarged Lindås Municipality. *All of Hosanger located on the island of Osterøy (population: 1,616) became a part of the new Osterøy Municipality. Government =Municipal council= The municipal council of Hosanger was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: Hosanger Church Hosanger Church The historic Hosanger Church was built in 1796. It is located in the village of Hosanger and it served as the main church for the municipality. It is a Romanesque-style church constructed of brick and stone. On the site there once was a stave church dating back to the Middle Ages. It was first mentioned in historical records in 1329. Later, a wooden church was constructed. The wooden church was struck by lightning and burned down on Christmas Day 1795. From 1863 until 1865, the church was extended to the west. The vestry extension on the south side of the church was built in 1962–1964.

Cuisine  The Slavic-American communities introduced the pierogi to Pittsburgh Traditional Pittsburgh foods reflect the city's multicultural heritage, especially that of the European immigrants of the early 20th century. While these immigrant populations introduced dishes such as pierogis to the city, they are now enjoyed by Pittsburghers in general. Other Pittsburgh food specialties were developed in the city. In general, these dishes are still popular because for many years, they satisfied the hearty appetite of the archetypal Pittsburgher: the hard-working, blue-collar steelworker. * Cabbage rolls –(aka Halupki)– Beef, pork, rice, green pepper, wrapped in cabbage and baked with sauerkraut and tomato soup or juice. * Chipped Ham – (aka Chipped Chopped Ham) thinly- sliced processed ham, from Isaly's since 1933. * City Chicken – cubes of pork and/or veal baked or fried on a wooden skewer. * Clark Bar – chocolate candy bar; developed in the city in 1917. * Essie's Original Hot Dog shop - an Oakland staple since 1960. * Halušky – noodles with fried cabbage (Polish), or cottage cheese (Slovak). * Iron City Beer – native brew; with a shot of whiskey, a boilermaker; with a shot of Imperial, an imp-n-arn. * Italian sausage – with grilled peppers and onions. * Kielbasa – eastern European sausages. * Pierogi – Polish dish, pasta dough filled with potato and cheese, onion or sauerkraut. * Primanti Brothers – sandwich with fries and coleslaw in it. * Sarris Candies - chocolates and ice cream originating in Canonsburg * Teutonia Männerchor - Deutschtown (East Allegheny) German food. * Wholey's – Founded in 1912 in Pittsburgh's market square and now located on Penn Ave; Wholey's serves a wide variety of seafood and a famous fish sandwich.

And the Renaissance and Baroque Society of Pittsburgh hosts early music concerts of artists from across the country. = Jazz = Pittsburgh became an important gateway between the north, south, east and west of the U.S., playing a strong role in the development of jazz. Jazz came to the city's African American neighborhoods after 1925. The Hill District became known as \\"Little Harlem\\" from the 1920s until the early 1950s. There were hundreds of jazz venues in the community, which later helped to promote the emergence of bebop, the most famous was probably the Crawford Grill which nightly attracted top national talent. A number of influential musicians emerged from the city. Mary Lou Williams, Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Billy Strayhorn, who was Duke Ellington's primary musical collaborator for 28 years, came from the city's East End regions of Homewood and East Liberty. A number of musicians came from communities outside the city, including: Maxine Sullivan (Homestead), Sonny Clark (Herminie) and Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines (Duquesne). Vocalist and bandleader Billy Eckstine was one of the first musicians to be paid a $1 million recording contract. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge, drummer Kenneth Spearman \\"Klook\\" Clarke, and influential bassist Ray Brown were born in the city; singer Lena Horne was raised in Pittsburgh. Bassist Paul Chambers, also born in Pittsburgh, played on two of the most important albums in jazz history: Miles Davis' Kind of Blue (1959) and John Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960). Other noted jazz musicians include: Eric Kloss, Dodo Marmarosa, Walt Harper, Tommy and Stanley Turrentine, Horace Parlan, pianist, Nathan Davis, guitarist George Benson, and drummers Art Blakey, Roger Humphries and Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts. A young Lena Horne also spent her formative years learning jazz and blues in the city's Hill District. = Popular music = Pittsburgh's role in popular music began with native Stephen Foster and his enduring classics of the 1800s. So influential was Foster's works that he been called the \\"Father of American music\\", has had five films made of his life, has heavily influenced such talents as Nellie Bly and Jackie Gleason and has had two of his songs chosen as state anthems (Kentucky and Florida) as well as the annual selections of Churchill Downs. Pittsburgh is perhaps most associated for the plethora of Doo Wop artists that were produced during the 1950s and 1960s, thanks in part to local legendary disc jockey Porky Chedwick playing songs that in most other major markets wouldn't risk being played. Several groups such as the Del- Vikings, The Marcels, The Vogues and The Skyliners exemplify the regions doo- wop contributions. During this same era notable solo acts such as Henry Mancini, Perry Como and Bobby Vinton came out of the region to reach world fame in the industry. A years long engagement at the city's William Penn Hotel also launched the national career of Lawrence Welk. During the 1970s and 1980s rock era Pittsburgh had a major role in the success of both Wild Cherry and their most popular song/album Play That Funky Music (inspired by a fan's plea to them during a performance at the North Side's 2001 Club in 1976), and being the home to Bret Michaels, known for his fame in the band Poison. Both Joe Grushecky and Donnie Iris achieved one-hit wonder fame and lasting regional rock fame. Several notable bands emerged from Pittsburgh in the 1990s, including Rusted Root, The Clarks, Don Caballero, and the punk rock bands Anti-Flag and Aus-Rotten. Rusted Root and The Clarks appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. Formed in 1999, the garage rock group Modey Lemon toured the U.S. and internationally, gaining favorable reviews. Singer Christina Aguilera, a student at North Allegheny Intermediate High School, debuted locally at the 1999 Lilith Fair, before going on to sell over 43 million albums worldwide. In the 2000s, Anti-Flag produced five albums, signed to RCA Records and appeared several times on the Vans Warped Tour. Rapper Wiz Khalifa, who signed to Warner Bros. Records but left without releasing an album, topped the iTunes singles chart by the end of the decade. Mashup/laptop music artist Girl Talk (Gregg Gillis) found mainstream success. His 2006 album Night Ripper gained favorable reviews and Feed the Animals (2008) topped year end album lists in national media. Since 2010, solo acts such as natives Jackie Evancho, Slimmie Hendrix, Wiz Khalifa, Daya (singer), and Mac Miller have achieved worldwide fame. Josh Groban was trained in Pittsburgh, having attended Carnegie Mellon University. Universally-acclaimed Hardcore/Metalcore band Code Orange are also from Pittsburgh.  Dance  Pittsburgh Dance Council and the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater host a variety of dance events. Polka, folk, square and round dancing have a long history in the city and are celebrated by the internationally famous Duquesne University Tamburitzans, a multicultural academy dedicated to the preservation and presentation of folk songs and dance. Museums and art Tyrannosaurus rex skull, Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Pittsburgh has several visual arts museums, including the Andy Warhol Museum, dedicated to the works of Pittsburgh native Andy Warhol. The Carnegie Museum of Art is home to works by such luminaries as Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Robert Adam and many others, along with galleries of sculpture, modern art, the Heinz Architectural Center, a large film and video collection, and various traveling exhibits.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle which results in impaired diastolic filling of the heart ventricles, i.e. the large heart chambers which pump blood into the pulmonary or systemic circulation. Diastole is the part of the cardiac contraction- relaxation cycle in which the heart fills with venous blood after the emptying done during its previous systole (i.e. contraction). An eosinophil-based specific type of heart damage was first described by the Swiss doctor, Wilhelm Loeffler, in 1936. As initially described, the disorder manifests as a restrictive cardiomyopathy, i.e. a poorly expanding and contracting rigid heart that was infiltrated with eosinophils and showed replacement of heart cells by stiff fibrotic connective tissue. Loeffler endocarditis is now regarded as a manifestation of eosinophilic myocarditis, a disorder that involves the infiltration of the heart's muscular layer by eosinophils that leads to three progressive clinical stages. The first stage involves acute inflammation and subsequent death of heart muscle cells. This stage is dominated by signs and symptoms of the acute coronary syndrome such as angina, heart attack, and congestive heart failure. In the second stage, the endocardium (i.e. interior wall) of the heart forms blood clots which break off and then travel through and block various arteries; this clotting stage may dominate the initial presentation in some individuals. The third stage is a fibrotic stage, i.e. Loeffler endocarditis, wherein scarring replaces damaged heart muscle tissue to cause a poorly contracting heart and/or heart valve disease. Recent publications commonly refer to Loeffler endocarditis as a historical term for the third stage of eosinophilic myocarditis. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of Loeffler endocarditis tend to reflect the many underlying disorders causing eosinophil dysfunction as well as the widely differing progression rates of cardiac damage. Before cardiac symptoms are detected, individuals may suffer symptoms of a common cold, asthma, rhinitis, urticarial, or other allergic disorder. Cardiac manifestations include life- threatening conditions such as cardiogenic shock or sudden death due to abnormal heart rhythms. More commonly, however, the presenting cardiac signs and symptoms of the disorder are the same as those seen in other forms of cardiomyopathy: the heart arrhythmia of ventricular fibrillation seen as an irregular pulse and heart rate, other cardiac arrhythmias, symptoms of these arrhythmias such as chest palpitations, dizziness, light headedness, and fainting; and symptoms of a heart failure such as fatigue, edema, i.e. swelling, of the lower extremities, and shortness of breath. Hypereosinophilia (i.e. blood eosinophil counts at or above 1,500 per microliter) or, less commonly, eosinophilia (counts above 500 but below 1,500 per microliter) are found in the vast majority of cases and are valuable clues pointing to this rather than other types of cardiomyopathies. However, elevated blood eosinophil counts may not occur during the early phase of the disorder. Other, less specific laboratory findings implicate a cardiac disorder but not necessarily eosinophilic myocarditis. These include elevations in blood markers for systemic inflammation (e.g. C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and cardiac injury (e.g. creatine kinase, troponins); and abnormal electrocardiograms ( mostly ST segment-T wave abnormalities). Pathogenesis Eosinophilic states that may occur in and underlie Loeffler endocarditis (as well as the other stages of eosinophilic myocarditis) include primary and secondary eosinophilias or hypereosinophilias. Primary eosinophilias or hypereosinophilias (i.e. disorders in which the eosinophil appears to be intrinsically diseased) that lead to Loeffler endocarditis are clonal hypereosinophilia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia and the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Secondary causes (i.e. disorders in which other diseases cause the eosinophil to become dysfunctional) include allergic and autoimmune diseases; infections due to certain parasitic worms, protozoa, and viruses; malignant and premalignant hematologic disorders commonly associated with eosinophilia or hypereosinophilia; and adverse reactions to various drugs. See causes of eosinophilic myocarditis for further details. The disorder develops because of eosinophilic penetration into the cardiac tissues. This leads to a fibrotic thickening of portions of the heart (similar to that of endomyocardial fibrosis) and heart valves. In consequence, the heart becomes rigid and poorly contractile while the heart valves may become stenotic or insufficient, i.e. reduced in ability to open or close, respectively. The damaged heart may also develop mural thrombi, i.e. clots which lay against ventricle walls, tend to break off, and flow through and block arteries; this condition often precedes the fibrotic stage of eosinophilic myocarditis and is termed the thrombotic stage. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Loeffler endocarditis should be considered in individuals exhibiting signs and symptoms of poor heart contractility and/or valve disease in the presence of significant increases in blood eosinophil counts. Ancillary tests may help in the diagnosis. Echocardiography typically gives non-specific and only occasional findings of endocardium thickening, left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricle dilation, and involvement of the mitral and/or tricuspid valves. Gadolinium-based cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful non-invasive procedure for diagnosing eosinophilic myocarditis. It supports this diagnosis if it shows at least two of the following abnormalities: a) an increased signal in T2-weighted images; b) an increased global myocardial early enhancement ratio between myocardial and skeletal muscle in enhanced T1 images and c) one or more focal enhancements distributed in a non-vascular pattern in late enhanced T1-weighted images. Additionally, and unlike in other forms of myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis may also show enhanced gadolinium uptake in the sub-endocardium. However, the only definitive test for Loeffler endocarditis is cardiac muscle biopsy showing the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates. Since the disorder may be patchy, multiple tissue samples taken during the procedure improve the chances of uncovering the pathology but in any case negative results do not exclude the diagnosis. Treatment Small studies and case reports have directed efforts towards: a) supporting cardiac function by relieving heart failure and suppressing life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms; b) suppressing eosinophil-based cardiac inflammation; and c) treating the underlying disorder. In all cases of Loeffler endocarditis that have no specific treatment regimens for the underlying disorder, available studies recommend treating the inflammatory component of this disorder with non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, principally high-dosage followed by slowly-tapering to low-dosage maintenance corticosteroid regimens. Afflicted individuals who fail this regimen or present with cardiogenic shock may benefit from treatment with other non-specific immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, as adjuncts to, or replacements for, corticosteroids. However, individuals with an underlying therapeutically accessible disease should be treated for this disease; in seriously symptomatic cases, such individuals may be treated concurrently with a corticosteroid regimen. Examples of diseases underlying Loefflers myocarditis that are recommended for treatments directed at the underlying disease include: *Infectious agents: specific drug treatment of helminth and protozoan infections typically takes precedence over non-specific immunosuppressive therapy, which, if used without specific treatment, could worsen the infection. In moderate-to-severe cases, non-specific immunosuppression is used in combination with specific drug treatment. *Toxic reactions to ingested agents: discontinuance of the ingested agent plus corticosteroids or other non-specific immunosuppressive regimens. *Clonal eosinophilia caused by mutations in genes that are highly susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or possibly FGFR1: first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. imatinib) are recommended for the former two mutations; a later generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ponatinib, alone or combined with bone marrow transplantation, may be useful for treating the FGFR1 mutations. *Clonal hypereosinophilia due to mutations in other genes or primary malignancies: specific treatment regimens used for these pre-malignant or malignant diseases may be more useful and necessary than non-specific immunosuppression. *Allergic and autoimmune diseases: non- specific treatment regimens used for these diseases may be useful in place of a simple corticosteroid regimen. For example, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis can be successfully treated with mepolizumab. *Idiopathic hypereosinphilic syndrome and lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia: corticosteroids; for individuals with these hypereosinophilias that are refractory to or break through corticosteroid therapy and individuals requiring corticosteroid-sparing therapy, recommended alternative drug therapies include hydroxyurea, Pegylated interferon-α, and either one of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and mepolizumab).

Chalmers qualified in medicine in the mid-1960s, and then practised as a clinician in the United Kingdom and two years (1969-1970) in the Gaza Strip. In the mid-1970s, he became a full-time health services researcher with a particular interest in assessing the effects of care. Between 1978 and 1992, he was the first director of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit in Oxford. There, Chalmers led the development of the electronic Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials (ODPT) and a collection of systematic reviews of randomized trials of care in pregnancy and children published in the two-volume Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth, co- authoring its summary, Guide to Effective Care in Pregnancy and Childbirth. The National Health Service Research and Development Programme supported extending the approach to other areas of health care. In 1992, Chalmers was appointed director of the UK Cochrane Centre, leading to the development of the international Cochrane Collaboration. Subsequently, he became founding editor of the James Lind Library, which documents the history and evolution of fair trials of treatments, and helped to establish the James Lind Alliance, a non-profit organization that \\"aims to identify the most important gaps in knowledge about the effects of treatments\\". The Library has established strategic agreements with international and non-profit organizations to disseminate its publications to a broad international and multilingual audience.Agreements Chalmers inspired champions all over the world leading to the development of the Cochrane Collaboration and by 2011 this collaboration had nearly 30,000 volunteers contributing towards summarising research evidence to improve health.

The counter coup began on 31 March on the Rumi calendar, which was the official calendar of the Ottoman Empire, corresponding to 13 April 1909 on the Gregorian calendar now used in Turkey. The rebellion had begun on 13 April 1909 and was put down by 24 April 1909. Ottoman historiography link the two events under the name 31 March Incident but refers to the actions by the Hareket Ordusu, the subsequent restoration of the constitution for a third time (after earlier attempts in 1876 and 1908) and the deposition of Abdul Hamid II who was then replaced by his younger brother Mehmed V. Background  The Young Turk Revolution, which began in the Balkan provinces, spread quickly throughout the empire and resulted in the Sultan Abdul Hamid II announcing the restoration of the Ottoman constitution of 1876 on 3 July 1908. The Ottoman general election of 1908 took place during November and December of that year. The Senate of the Ottoman Empire reconvened for the first time in over 30 years on 17 December 1908. The Chamber of Deputies' first session was on 30 January 1909. The Ottoman counter-coup of 13 April 1909 was a rebellion by conservative reactionaries in Constantinople against the restoration of the constitutional system. The counter-coup attempted to put an end to the nascent Second Constitutional Era in order to re-affirm the position of the Sultan Abdul Hamid II as the absolute monarch. The counter-coup, was instigated among some parts of the army primarily by a certain Cypriot Islamist Dervish Vahdeti, who reigned supreme in Istanbul for a few days. Events The CUP appealed to Mahmud Shevket Pasha, commander of the Ottoman Third Army based in Selanik (modern Thessaloniki) to quell the uprising by Dervish Vahdeti and his supporters. With support from the commander of the Ottoman Second Army in Edirne, Mahmud Shevket combined the armies to create a strike force named Hareket Ordusu (\\"Action Army\\"). The Action Army numbered 20,000-25,000 Ottoman troops and were involved in events known as the 31 March Incident toward ending the coup. The eleventh Reserve (Redif) Division based in Selanik composed the advance guard of the Action Army and the chief of staff was Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The Action Army were joined by 15,000 volunteers including 4,000 Bulgarians, 2,000 Greeks and 700 Jews. Adding to those numbers were Albanians that supported the Action Army with Çerçiz Topulli and Bajram Curri bringing 8,000 Albanian men and Major Ahmed Niyazi Bey with 1,800 men from Resne. In short time CUP members Fethi Okyar, Hafız Hakkı and Enver Bey returned from their international posts at Ottoman embassies and joined Mahmud Shevket as his military staff prior to reaching Istanbul. Traveling by train the soldiers went to Çatalca, then Hademköy and later reached Ayastefanos (modern Yeşilköy) located on the edge of Istanbul. A delegation was sent to Army headquarters by the Ottoman parliament that sought to stop it from taking Istanbul through force. The Action Army laid siege to Constantinople on 17 April 1909. The Sultan remained in the Yildiz and had frequent conferences with Grand Vizier Tewfik Pasha who announced: Negotiations continued for six days. The negotiators were Rear Admiral Arif Hikmet Pasha, Emanuel Karasu Efendi (Carasso), Esad Pasha Toptani, Aram Efendi and Colonel Galip Bey (Pasiner). Finally, at the moment when the conflict showed signs of extending to the public, the Salonikan troops entered Istanbul. On April 24 the occupation of Istanbul by the Action Army began in the early morning through military operations directed by Ali Pasha Kolonja, an Albanian, that retook the city with little resistance from the mutineers. The barracks of Tașkışla and Taksim offered strong resistance and by four o'clock of the afternoon the remaining rebels surrendered. The Macedonian troops attacked the Taksim and Tashkishla barracks. There was fierce street fighting in the European quarter where the guard houses were held by the First Army Corps. There was heavy fire from troops in the Tashkishla barracks against the advancing troops. The barracks had to be shelled and almost destroyed by the artillery located on the heights above the barracks before the garrison surrendered after several hours fighting and heavy losses. Equally desperate was the defence of the Taksim barracks. The attack on the Taksim barracks was led by Enver Bey. After a short battle they gained control of the palace on 27 April.Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 348 Sultan Abdul Hamid was deserted by most of his advisors. The parliament discussed the question as to whether he would be permitted to remain on the throne or be deposed or even be executed. Putting the Sultan to death was considered unwise as such a step might rouse a fanatical response and plunge the Empire into civil war. On the other hand, there were those who felt that after all that had happened it was impossible that the Parliament could ever again work with the Sultan.Edward Frederick Knight, The Awakening of Turkey: A History of the Turkish Revolution, page 350 On April 27 the Assembly held a meeting behind closed doors under the presidency of Said Pasha. In order to remove the Sultan, a fatwa was needed. So, a fatwa drawn up in the form of question and was given to scholars to answer and sign. A scholar by the name of Nuri Efendi was brought to sign the fatwa. Initially, Nuri Efendi was unsure whether three crimes raised in the question were carried out by Abdulhamid. He initially suggested that it would better to ask the Sultan to resign. It was insisted that Nuri Efendi sign the fatwa. However Nuri Efendi continued to refuse. Finally, Mustafa Asim Efendi convinced him and so the fatwa was signed by him and then it was signed by the newly appointed Sheikh ul Islam, Mehmed Ziyâeddin Efendi, legalising it. The fatwa complete with the answer was now read to the assembled members: Then the Assembly unanimously voted that Abdul Hamid should be deposed.

Outcome  The counter-coup's failure brought the Committee of Union and Progress back into power enabling it to form government. The incident led to a change of Grand Vizier with Ahmed Tevfik Pasha assumed the position. Other consequences were restoration of constitution for a third time (after earlier attempts in 1876 and 1908). Both parliamentary chambers convened together on April 27 and deposed Abdul Hamid II. He was replaced with his younger brother Reşat who took the name Mehmed V, to symbolically convey him as the second conquer of Istanbul after Mehmed II. Four CUP members composed of one Armenian, one Jew and two Muslim Albanians went to inform the sultan of his dethronement, with Essad Pasha Toptani being the main messenger saying \\"the nation has deposed you\\". Some Muslims expressed dismay that non Muslims had informed the sultan of his deposition. As a result, the focus of the sultan's rage was toward Toptani whom Abdul Hamid II felt had betrayed him. The sultan referred to him as a \\"wicked man\\", given that the extended Toptani family had benefited from royal patronage in gaining privileges and key positions in the Ottoman government. Albanians involved in the counterrevolutionary movement were executed such as Halil Bey from Krajë which caused indignation among conservative Muslims of Shkodër. After the 31 March Incident, the Committee of Union and Progress outlawed societies which supported ethnic minorities' interests within Ottoman society, including the Society of Arab Ottoman Brotherhood, and prohibited the publication of several journals and newspapers that featured radical Islamic rhetoric. Under the multi-religious \\"balancing policies\\", the Committee of Union and Progress believed it could achieve an \\"Ottomanisation\\" (i.e. Ottoman nationalism rather than ethnic or religious nationalism) of all the subjects of the Empire. These measures were successful in stirring some nationalist sentiment among the non- Turkish populations, further cementing a national sensibility resistant to conservative Islam.

They block beta-tubulin polymerization in a dividing cell. Sources The Madagascan periwinkle Catharanthus roseus L. is the source for a number of important natural products, including catharanthine and vindoline and the vinca alkaloids it produces from them: leurosine and the chemotherapy agents vinblastine and vincristine, all of which can be obtained from the plant. The newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine is used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and is not known to occur naturally. However, it can be prepared either from vindoline and catharanthine or from leurosine, in both cases by synthesis of anhydrovinblastine, which \\"can be considered as the key intermediate for the synthesis of vinorelbine.\\" The leurosine pathway uses the Nugent–RajanBabu reagent in a highly chemoselective de-oxygenation of leurosine. Anhydrovinblastine is then reacted sequentially with N-bromosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid followed by silver tetrafluoroborate to yield vinorelbine. 1000px Applications Vinca alkaloids are used in chemotherapy for cancer. They are a class of cell cycle–specific cytotoxic drugs that work by inhibiting the ability of cancer cells to divide: Acting upon tubulin, they prevent it from forming into microtubules, a necessary component for cellular division. The vinca alkaloids thus prevent microtubule polymerization, as opposed to the mechanism of action of taxanes. Vinca alkaloids are now produced synthetically and used as drugs in cancer therapy and as immunosuppressive drugs. These compounds include vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, and vinorelbine. Additional researched vinca alkaloids include vincaminol, vineridine, and vinburnine. Vinpocetine is a semi-synthetic derivative of vincamine (sometimes described as \\"a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine\\"). Minor vinca alkaloids include minovincine, methoxyminovincine, minovincinine, vincadifformine, desoxyvincaminol, and vincamajine.

Alcalá used to be known as Alcalá de los Panaderos (Alcalá of the Bakers) because it provided most of Seville's bread. The town is located on the banks of the Guadaíra River, and watermills built during the Moorish period of Spain can still be found in the area. History Towers of the city's fortress Irippo, the main Turdetan city in the Guadaíra basin, was located in Mesa de Gandul (Alcalá de Guadaíra), and minted its own coin in Roman times.Robert W. Wallace (2017), “The bronze coinage of Iberian Irippo. Politics and necessity in an age of uncertainty?”, in Δεσμοὶ φιλίας: Bonds of Friendship. Studies in Ancient History in honour of Francisco Javier Fernández Nieto, Barcelona: Universidad de Barcelona, 349-360. The site of Alcalá was taken by Muslim forces in the 8th century and their name has held to modern times. The toponym Alcalá, from the Arabic القلعة al-qalʿa for fortification or citadel, is shared by many places throughout Spain. Alcalá de Guadaíra was under the domination of multiple Muslim kingdoms from the Umayyad Caliphate in 756 to the fall of the Almohads in 1244. It was the Almohads who built extensive fortifications on a promontory overlooking the river. These fortifications continue to dominate the south-west side of the town. In 1244, Alcalá de Guadaíra was captured by Ferdinand III of Castile who was responsible for the refurbishing of the castle and town fortifications, which were subsequently used as a royal prison with a military presence. Following Ferdinand's death it fell into disrepair and ceased to be a prison or military barracks. Alcalá was home to a small but important Jewish community. In December, 1390, Archdeacon Ferand Martinez led a mob that razed the synagogue to the ground. The members of the Jewish community were soon after put to the sword. This town was the birthplace of Leandro José de Flores (1776–1839), priest and historian. Main sights The current walls date to the 13th and 14th century. In the castle precincts is The Hermitage of Our Lady of the Eagle (Nuestra Señora del Águila), this building dates from the mid-13th century when it was the principal church of the town. Over subsequent centuries, as the town expanded, more churches were constructed and the church of Santiago became the principal parish. Many of the valuable artifacts were taken from the hermitage to Santiago but the image of \\"La Virgin del Águila\\" remains there. The image of the virgin is a replica of the original that was destroyed in 1936. The nearby Marchenilla Castle (14th century) was built on the ruins of a Roman estate. upright=3 Economy Without doubt Alcalá de Guadaíra is an industrial town. Its industrial heritage started in the watermills constructed by the Moors on the banks of the River Guadaíra. These mills were used to grind grain to make flour which supplied bakers in the area. This led over the centuries to Alcalá's reputation as the \\"bread basket\\" of Seville. The other industry of historical times was the processing of olives. There were up to 12 olive processing factories in Alcalá in the early 20th century employing many thousands of workers, predominantly women, to prepare the olives for sale after they had been cured. Both of these industries have fallen into decline but have been replaced by a wide range of modern light and heavy industries on the numerous industrial estates in the north and west of the municipality. The town provides employment not only for local inhabitants but for residents of local towns. Geography Guadaíra River. Situated in southern Spain, Alcalá enjoys a mediterranean climate characterised by mild wet winters and hot dry summers. The town is on elevated terrain in relation to Seville, this area is known as Los Alcores, and Alcalá is the largest urban development in this area. The River Guadaíra runs through the town and has in places formed a steep sided valley with low cliffs. The upper river watershed is from the land to the east and south-east of the town, it proceeds through the town and joins the Guadalquivir to the south of Seville. The river has for many years been heavily contaminated with the by- products of olive processing and other waste being dumped directly into the river. Large amounts of foam and an unpleasant smell are not uncommon features of the river in the winter. In spite of this the river provides a haven for much wildlife as its banks are well covered with trees and vegetation. Until the beginning of the 20th century, in 1930 the dam was built in the Guadalquivir river as it passes Alcalá del Río, the Guadaira river was a major spawning river basin for the European Sturgeon (Acipenser sturio) sustaining a successful fishery and a caviar industry in the area. On 28 March 2007 the only figurative bridge in Europe, the Dragon Bridge, was inaugurated as part of the town's beltway. On the southern side of the river is a large area of stone pine woodland, Oromana. Transportation The A-92 motorway runs east–west through the north part of the town and the A-392 road runs from NE to SW through the town. The Tranvía Metropolitano de Alcalá de Guadaíra has been under construction since 2007, but has not opened as of 2020.

The company was founded by Amin Saigol in the 1930s with a small shop that eventually developed into the Kohinoor Rubber Works.\\"The richy rich ones of poorly poor nation\\": http://dailymailnews.com/dmsp0204/dm001.html. Historical background The Saigol family were originally farmers from a small town called Khotian, Chakwal District, Punjab, Pakistan. Khotian town was later named Saigolabad after this family. Sayeed Saigol moved to Calcutta in the 1930s and opened a shoe store. He opened a rubber shoe factory, and was a supplier of rubber shoes and raincoats to the Allied Forces during World War II. Saigol, anticipating the division and independence of British India, moved his assets to Lahore in the early 1940s. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, with the help of his younger brothers Yousuf and Bashir, he set up their first textile spinning mill in Lyallpur (now called Faisalabad) in 1949. Later the family expanded its textile business to Rawalpindi and Gujjar Khan, and bought a sugar mill in Jauharabad from the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation. In 1958–59, the Saigols founded the United Bank Limited. =Nationalisation and back to privatisation= In 1972, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime started its nationalization drive and most businesses of the Saigol Group were nationalized over the next four years. By 1976, only the textile and sugar businesses remained. Then came the General Zia-ul-Haq's regime in July, 1977 and back to privatization of industries started. In the early 1980s, the Saigol Group started rebuilding and reinvesting after their huge business losses due to nationalization of industries in Pakistan during the 1970s. The group is now managed by three Saigol brothers: Tariq Sayeed Saigol, Nasim, and Taufeeq. Also part of the family is sister Naz Saigol, now married to Mian Muhammad Mansha Yaha. Tariq Saigol, the eldest brother, is head of Kohinoor-Maple group, which owns the Kohinoor textile mills and Maple-Leaf Cement. He is known to be openly critical of the Pakistani government's lack of interest in the textile sector. Nasim Saigol heads PEL and Kohinoor industries. Rafiq, the youngest brother, takes care of the group's other business interests. Bashir Saigol was assigned the managing directorship of Kohinoor Textile Mills, Rawalpindi and Conforce Limited. He is survived by son Iqbal Saigol, who heads his own small group. After the division of the family silver, KTM Rawalpindi came to the lot of Tariq Saeed Saigol who is now heading his own Kohinoor group.

The municipality existed from 1885 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality included the whole Ogndalen valley and areas to the west, up to, but not including the town of Steinkjer in what is now the central and western part of the municipality of Steinkjer in Trøndelag county. Starting in 1917, the administrative center of Ogndal was actually located in the town of Steinkjer (even though that was not a part of Ogndal municipality). View of the Skei area in Ogndal Skei Church The main church for Ogndal, Skei Church, is located in the village of Skei in western Ogndal. Another church, Bodom Church, is located in the village of Bodom in the eastern part of the municipality. History The municipality of Skei was established on 1 January 1885 when it was separated from the larger municipality of Sparbu. The initial population of Skei was 1,441. On 13 December 1900, the name was changed from Skei to Ogndal, since the municipality encompasses the Ogndalen valley, through which the river Ogna flows. The municipality of Ogndal bordered the growing town of Steinkjer and as Steinkjer grew, it took over parts of Ogndal. On 1 January 1902, an unpopulated area in western Ogndal was transferred to the town of Steinkjer. In 1941, another small area of Ogndal (population: 57) was transferred to the town of Steinkjer. Again, in 1948, another small area of Ogndal (population: 78) was transferred to Steinkjer. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, a large merger took place: the neighboring municipalities of Beitstad (population: 2,563), Egge (population: 3,476), Kvam (population: 1,245), Ogndal (population: 2,678), Sparbu (population: 4,027), and Stod (population: 1,268) were all merged with the town of Steinkjer (population: 4,325) to form the new municipality of Steinkjer. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Ogndal, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Ogndal was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

They occur in several joints of the body, such as the knee joint and the atlanto-axial joint. In a fashion similar to the cords in a toy Jacob's ladder, the crossed ligaments stabilize the joint while allowing a very large range of motion. Knee =Structure= Cruciate ligaments Cruciate ligaments occur in the knee of humans and other bipedal animals and the corresponding stifle of quadrupedal animals, and in the neck, fingers, and foot. * The cruciate ligaments of the knee are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). These ligaments are two strong, rounded bands that extend from the head of the tibia to the intercondyloid notch of the femur. The ACL is lateral and the PCL is medial. They cross each other like the limbs of an X. They are named for their insertion into the tibia: the ACL attaches to the anterior aspect of the intercondylar area, the PCL to the posterior aspect. The ACL and PCL remain distinct throughout and each has its own partial synovial sheath. Relative to the femur, the ACL keeps the tibia from slipping forward and the PCL keeps the tibia from slipping backward. * Another structure of this type in human anatomy is the cruciate ligament of the dens of the atlas vertebra, also called \\"cruciform ligament of the atlas\\", a ligament in the neck forming part of the atlanto-axial joint.Anatomy of Spinal Vertebrae Tutorial . * In the fingers, the deep and superficial flexor tendons pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel system – the flexor mechanism – of annular and cruciate ligaments called pulleys. The cruciate pulleys tether the long flexor tendons. The number and extent of these cruciate and annular ligaments varies among individuals, but three cruciate and four or five annular ligaments are normally found in each finger (usually referred to as, for example, \\"A1 pulley\\" and \\"C1 pulley\\"). The thumb has a similar system for its long flexor tendon but with a single oblique pulley replacing the cruciate pulleys found in the fingers. * The human foot has a cruciate crural ligament, also known as inferior extensor retinaculum of foot. The equine foot has a pair of cruciate distal sesamoidean ligaments in the metacarpophalangeal joint. These ligaments can be seen using computed tomography. =Clinical significance= Rupture Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament is one of the \\"most frequent acquired diseases of the stifle joint\\" in humans, dogs, and cats; direct trauma to the joint is relatively uncommon and age appears to be a major factor.Neãas A., J . Zatloukal, H. Kecová, M. Dvofiák: Predisposition of Dog Breeds to Rupture of Cranial Cruciate Ligament . Acta Vet. Brno 2000, 69: 305-310.. Cruciate ligament injuries are common in animals, and in 2005 a study estimated that $1.32 billion was spent in the United States in treating the cranial cruciate ligament of dogs.Wilke VL. (2005). Estimate of the annual economic impact of treatment of cranial cruciate ligament injury in dogs in the United States. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Rupture in canines and surgical repair techniques * In animals the two cruciate ligaments that cross the inside of the knee joint are referred to as the cranial cruciate (equivalent to anterior in humans) and the caudal cruciate (equivalent to the posterior in humans). The cranial cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from slipping forward out from under the femur.Brooks, Wendy C. Ruptured Anterior (Cranial) Cruciate Ligament. “Veterinary Information Network, Inc.” 2005 *Stifle injuries are one of the most common causes of lameness in rear limbs in dogs, and cruciate ligament injuries are the most common lesion in the stifle joint. A rupture of the cruciate ligament usually involves a rear leg to suddenly become so sore that the dog can barely bear weight on it. *How a rupture can occur: There are several ways a dog can tear or rupture the cruciate ligament. Young athletic dogs can be seen with this rupture if they take a bad step while playing too rough and injure their knee. Older dogs, especially if overweight, can have weakened ligaments that can be stretched or torn by simply stepping down off the bed or jumping. Large overweight dogs are at more risk for ruptures of the cruciate ligament. In these instances it is common to see a rupture in the other leg within a year's time of the first rupture. *Common breeds that are seen with cruciate ligament ruptures: In recent survey's some of the large breed dogs that seem to be at risk for obtaining these ruptures were: Neapolitan mastiff, Newfoundland, St. Bernard, Rottweiler, Chesapeake Bay retriever, Akita, and American Staffordshire terrier. However, other breeds have been observed with these ruptures, such as: Labradors, Labrador crossbreeds, Poodles, Poodle crossbreeds, Bichon Frises, German Shepherds, Shepherd crossbreeds, and Golden Retrievers.Harasen, Greg Canine cranial cruciate ligament rupture in profile. “The Canadian Veterinary Journal” 2003, 44(10): 845-846 *Diagnosis: History, palpation, observation and proper radiography is important in properly assessing the patient. The key in diagnosing a rupture of the cruciate ligament is the demonstration of an abnormal gait in the dog. Abnormal knee motion is typically observed and diagnosis of a rupture can be made by performing the drawer sign test.Harasen, Greg Diagnosing rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. “The Canadian Veterinary Journal” 2002, 43(6): 475-476 The drawer sign: *The examiner stands behind the dog and places a thumb on the caudal aspect of the femoral condylar region with the index finger on the patella. The other thumb is placed on the head of the fibula with the index finger on the tibial crest. The ability to move the tibia forward (cranially) with respect to a fixed femur is a positive cranial drawer sign indicative of a rupture (it will look like a drawer being opened). Another method used to diagnose a rupture is the tibial compression test, in which a veterinarian will stabilize the femur with one hand and flex the ankle with the other hand. The tibia will move abnormally forward if a rupture is present. For proper diagnosis sedation is typically needed since most animals tend to be tense or frightened at the vet's office. If the animal tenses its muscles, temporary stabilization of the knee can be observed which would prevent demonstration of the drawer sign or tibial compression test. Radiographs are typically necessary to identify whether bone chips, from where the ligament attaches to the tibia, are present. This can occur when the cruciate ligament tears, and if found will require surgical repair. *Surgical repair Three surgical techniques are commonly used *Extracapsular repair Any bone spurs are removed and a large suture is passed around the fabella behind the knee through a drilled hole in the front of the tibia. This surgical procedure tightens the joint to prevent the drawer motion, and the suture that is put in place takes the job of the cruciate ligament for approximately 2 to 12 months after surgery. The suture will eventually break and the dog will have its own healed tissue that will hold the knee in place.Tong, Kim Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL)- Extracapsular Repair. “Dallas Veterinary Surgical Center” 2015 *Tibial plateau leveling osteotomy This surgery uses biomechanics of the knee joint and is meant to address the lack of success seen in the extracapsular repair surgery in larger dogs. A stainless steel bone plate is used to hold the two pieces of bone in place. This surgery is complex and typically costs more than the extracapsular repair.Tong, Kim Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL)- Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy (TPLO) “Dallas Veterinary Surgical Center” 2015 *Tibial tuberosity advancement This surgery aims at advancing the tibial tuberosity forward in order to modify the pull of the quadriceps muscle group, which in turn helps reduce tibial thrust and ultimately stabilizes the knee. The tibial tuberosity is separated and anchored to its new position by a titanium or steel cage, “fork”, and plate. Bone graft is used to stimulate bone healing.Tong, Kim Cranial Cruciate Ligament (CCL)- Tibial Tuberosity Advancement (TTA) “Dallas Veterinary Surgical Center” 2015 Other locations Annular (A1-A5) and cruciform (C0-C3) ligaments of the tendon sheath over the flexor tendons of the index finger of the right hand. *Cruciate ligament of atlas *Cruciform ligaments of fingers.

The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act established the World War I Centennial Commission, which was given the authority to build the memorial in Pershing Park, located at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., in the United States. The park, which has existed since 1981, also contains the John J. Pershing General of the Armies commemorative work. In January 2016, the design commission selected the submission \\"The Weight of Sacrifice\\", by a team consisting of Joseph Weishaar, Sabin Howard, Phoebe Lickwar, and GWWO Architects, as the winning design. Pershing Park The Pershing Park site was originally occupied by a variety of 19th-century structures until about 1930, when the federal government took legal title to the block and demolished the structures on it. Legislation officially designating the plot as a Pershing Square subsequently was adopted by Congress in 1957.; Development of the square proved controversial, as different groups offered competing proposals for memorials to John J. Pershing, who had served as General of the Armies in World War I.; These disagreements led to inaction, and by 1962 the square remained bare and often cluttered with trash.; In September 1963, District of Columbia officials finally planted grass and flower beds to temporarily beautify the square. In November 1963, the President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue proposed a master plan for the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue NW from the White House to the United States Capitol. The master plan proposed constructing a National Plaza (also called the Western Plaza), which would have required the demolition of the Pershing Square, the Willard Hotel north of the square, and the two blocks of buildings and streets east of these tracts.; The American Legion, among others, kept pushing for a grand statue of Pershing for the square, but all plans for the park were suspended until such time as the Pennsylvania Avenue master plan could be finalized.; National Plaza was never constructed. Instead, a much smaller Freedom Plaza was built which did not require the demolition of Pershing Park (as the square was now known). Designs for a statue and memorial to Pershing and for the larger park were finalized in the 1970s, and Pershing Park constructed simultaneously with Freedom Plaza from 1979 to 1981. During this period, the park was slightly enlarged due to the realignment of Pennsylvania Avenue NW along the area's north side. Pershing Park formally opened to the public at 11:45 AM on May 14, 1981. Pershing Park contains a statue of General Pershing by Robert White, as well as memorial walls and benches behind the statue describing Pershing's achievements in World War I. The park also contains a fountain, a pond (which turns into an ice rink in the winter), and flower beds. The ice rink is managed by a concessionaire of the National Park Service. Pershing Park was owned by the government of the District of Columbia, but administered by the National Park Service as an official unit of the park system (managed under the agency's National Mall and Memorial Parks administrative group). More than 400 demonstrators were illegally arrested in Pershing Park in September 2002 during anti-globalization protests against the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. National World War I Memorial John J. Pershing Memorial in Pershing Park In 1931, the people of the District of Columbia erected the District of Columbia War Memorial on the National Mall to honor individuals from the District who had served in the U.S. armed forces in World War I. But the largest of the country's World War I memorials was the Liberty Memorial, a tall tower with an artificial \\"burning pyre\\" atop it, located in Kansas City, Missouri. A Memorial Court surrounded the tower, with a Memory Hall (dedicated to the memory of Kansas Citians who died in the war) on the east and a Museum Building on the west. Ground was broken on the memorial on November 1, 1921, and it opened on November 11, 1926. But no national memorial commemorating World War I was erected over the next 70 years, which upset World War I veterans. The Liberty Memorial suffered from neglect over the years, and the tower was closed to the public in 1994. A $102 million renovation and expansion effort began in 2000, and the memorial reopened in 2002. The expansion, which added in museum space, a research center, a theater, a cafeteria, and modern storage for the museum's extensive collection, opened in 2006. =The National World War I Museum= *this refers to the monument in Missouri, not DC* With the 2000 Liberty Memorial renovation under way, Senator Kit Bond (R-Missouri) introduced a resolution (S.Con.Res. 114) in the United States Senate giving official federal recognition to the Liberty Memorial as \\"America's National World War I Museum\\". The designation was only honorific, but nevertheless the resolution did not pass. In 2004, with the National World War II Memorial about to open in Washington, D.C., Representative Karen McCarthy (D-Missouri) introduced legislation (H.Con.Res. 421) in the United States House of Representatives to designate the Liberty Memorial as \\"America's National World War I Museum\\". In the Senate, Senator Jim Talent (R-Missouri) sought agreement to amend S. 2400, the Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, with identical language. Talent's amendment was unanimously adopted by the Senate on June 15, 2004. The Senate bill was reconciled with a similar House bill (H.R. 4200) in conference committee, and passed both houses of Congress. President George W. Bush signed the legislation into law on October 28, 2004 (PL 108-375). =Early legislative efforts to create a National World War I Memorial= The Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. The push for a national World War I memorial arose from the successful effort to establish the National World War II Memorial. Legislation to establish the National World War II Memorial was introduced in 1987, and after several unsuccessful efforts passed Congress on May 12, 1993. President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law on May 25. The memorial was dedicated on May 28, 2004. In the fall of 2000, Jan Scruggs, chief executive officer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, proposed rededicating the District of Columbia War Memorial in honor of all World War I veterans. Scruggs claimed that a member of Congress was working on legislation to effect the change, and that a bill would be introduced shortly, but no bill was forthcoming in the 106th Congress. Nor was legislation introduced in the 107th, 108th, or 109th Congresses. In 2008, the American Legion called for conversion of the District of Columbia War Memorial as well. To give added impetus to the effort, local D.C.-area attorney Edwin Fountain formed the World War I Memorial Foundation to solicit funds and act as a lobby for the effort. D.C. Council member Jack Evans (in whose ward the D.C. War Memorial was located) and Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s Delegate to Congress, both became honorary trustees of the foundation. That same year, during the 110th Congress, Representative Ted Poe (R-Texas) introduced legislation (H.R. 6696) to create a National World War I Memorial. The previous year, Poe had met Frank Buckles, the last surviving American veteran of World War I. Buckles expressed his dismay that there was no national World War I memorial, and Poe began to champion his cause. The legislation (H.R.6696), titled the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act, authorized the American Battle Monuments Commission to either take over the District of Columbia War Memorial or to build a new one on the same site. The bill also established a World War I Memorial Advisory Board to assist in raising funds to build the memorial. Referred to committee, the bill died there after Senators Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) grew concerned that the \\"new\\" memorial would compete with the Liberty Memorial in their state. McCaskill and Representative Emanuel Cleaver introduced legislation in the House (H.R. 7243) and Senate (S. 3589) to designate the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Memorial. Both bills died in committee. Separately, Bond and Cleaver introduced legislation (H.R. 6960 and S. 3537) to establish a World War I Centennial Commission to develop and implement programs to commemorate the centennial of World War I. Both bills were referred to committee, and both died there. In 2009, McCaskill reintroduced her legislation in the Senate (S. 760) to have the Liberty Memorial designated the National World War I Memorial. Bond reintroduced his legislation in the Senate (S. 761) to establish a centennial commission. Both bills died in committee. Companion legislation in the House (H.R. 1849), introduced once more by Cleaver, combined the two bills. The Cleaver bill passed the House, but was never taken up by the Senate. Separately, Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) introduced legislation in the Senate (S. 2097) to allow Fountain's World War I Memorial Foundation to take over the D.C. War Memorial and re-establish it as the National World War I Memorial. Efforts to rename the D.C. War Memorial gain support when the D.C. Council voted in 2009 to support the Thune bill. Hearings were held on Thune's bill, at which Frank Buckles (now 108 years old) testified. Representatives from the National Park Service also testified in favor of the bill, noting that there was no longer any room on the National Mall for a major memorial. But it, too, died in committee. Poe introduced companion legislation in the House (H.R. 482), but it also died in committee, ending legislative activity for the 111th Congress. =Creating the World War I Centennial Commission= Legislation creating two distinct National World War I Memorials finally passed the 112th Congress. The final bill was a compromise, which designated the Liberty Memorial as one of the World War I memorials and the Pershing Park site in Washington, D.C., as the second memorial. The genesis of the compromise can be traced to 2008, when attorney Edwin Fountain suggested that there be two memorials. Senator Thune offered his support for the solution in December 2009. Much activity preceded passage of the final bill. On February 1, 2011, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-West Virginia) introduced compromise legislation in the Senate (S. 253) which (a) established a World War I Centennial Commission and (b) designated both the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City and the District of Columbia War Memorial in Washington, D.C., as National World War I Memorials. Rockefeller's bill authorized the World War I Memorial Foundation to raise funds and oversee the transformation of the D.C. memorial. His bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. But citizens of the District of Columbia were increasingly opposed to losing their hometown memorial. The Rhodes Tavern-D.C. Heritage Society, a prominent local historic preservation organization, advocated turning Pershing Square into the memorial as a commemorative statue to General Pershing already occupied the site. The World War I Memorial Foundation opposed the Pershing Square site as too isolated by busy D.C. streets, and argued that being off the National Mall diminished the importance of the war. The foundation also opposed any new designation for the Liberty Memorial for the same reason. The District of Columbia War Memorial. On February 27, Frank Buckles died of natural causes. His death generated an outpouring of emotion, including an effort to have him lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda. On March 8, Rep. Poe introduced new legislation, the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act (H.R. 938). Like Cleaver's bill from the previous Congress, it established both a memorial and a centennial commission. Poe's bill differed from past efforts, however, in that it designated both the Liberty Memorial and the District of Columbia War Memorial as the National World War I Memorial. This represented an agreement by the Missouri delegation (which now included Senator Roy Blunt, as Kit Bond had retired), Thune, and Poe. As with his 2009 bill, Poe's new effort authorized the World War I Memorial Foundation to raise funds, design the memorial, and oversee its erection. Poe's bill was referred to both the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Natural Resources. On January 24, 2012, the Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Federal Lands held hearings on the bill. Opposition to the takeover of the D.C. War Memorial was growing. On July 8, 2011, Del. Norton introduced H.Res. 346, a non-binding resolution which expressed the sense of the House of Representatives that the District of Columbia War Memorial should remain dedicated solely to the residents of the District of Columbia. Norton's change in position came about after she came to perceive the redesignation of the memorial as a diminishment of the District of Columbia, similar to the lack of voting rights for District residents. D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray also publicly opposed the redesignation effort. In December 2011, the Association of the Oldest Inhabitants of the District of Columbia, a local group of long-time D.C. residents, also went on record opposing redesignation of the D.C. War Memorial. With time running out in the 112th Congress, and less than two years before the start of the World War I centennial, on September 10, 2012, Rep. Poe introduced the World War I Centennial Commission Act (H.R. 6364), which established the World War I Centennial Commission to oversee World War I centennial commemorations, programs, and observances. The bill also designated the Liberty Memorial as the \\"National World War I Museum and Memorial\\", a symbolic designation to improve its national prominence prior to the war centennial. The bill also took a new approach to the creation of a World War I memorial in Washington, D.C. In June 2012, Poe agreed to abandon his effort to redesignate the District of Columbia War memorial. Instead, his bill authorized the World War I Memorial Foundation to create a new commemorative work on of ground at Constitution Gardens, an area on the north side of the National Mall located between the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Washington Monument. As with previous efforts, the bill was referred to both the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Natural Resources. During markup of the bill by the Committee on Natural Resources on December 5, 2012, the bill was amended to reduce the acreage allotted to the memorial to from , and for the memorial to be erected on any federal land within the District of Columbia (including the National Mall). The bill was unanimously approved by the committee, It passed the House on a voice vote on December 12. Senator McCaskill offered an amendment in the nature of a substitute which removed the designation of the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Museum and Memorial, and removed the authority to build a memorial in Washington, D.C. The Senate approved the amended bill on December 21. A House–Senate conference committee agreed to the Senate's changes. On December 31, the House approved the Senate-amended bill. President Barack Obama signed the legislation into law (P.L. 112-272) on January 14, 2013. =Creating two National World War I Memorials= 107-year-old Frank Buckles (right), meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2008. Buckles' death in 2011 reinvigorated efforts to pass legislation authorizing a memorial. In early 2012, Delegate Norton agreed to organize her fellow Democrats in the House in opposition to redesignation of the D.C. War Memorial. In the spring, Norton's staff worked out an agreement with Poe and Cleaver in which they agreed to prohibit infringement on the D.C. memorial. In exchange, Norton agreed to support construction of a national World War I memorial on the National Mall. Yet, by the summer of 2012, D.C. officials, Norton, and their congressional supporters were pushing for a national World War I memorial at Pershing Park. The D.C. Council passed a nonbinding resolution to that effect in June. Norton's shift in attitude came after National Park Service officials convinced her that allowing construction on the Mall would severely weaken the Commemorative Works Act, an amendment to which in 2003 had all but banned new memorials on the Mall. Meanwhile, discussion among members of Congress had turned toward giving the World War I Centennial Commission authority to build the new memorial. The centennial commission, too, concluded that there was no room on the Mall to build a memorial. Rep. Poe reintroduced memorial legislation on January 14, 2013, just 13 days after the 113th Congress began. Titled the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act (H.R. 222), the bill redesignated the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Museum and Memorial, and authorized the World War I Memorial Foundation to establish a World War I commemorative work on federal land on the National Mall. Referred to committee, the bill was never acted on. As the second session of the 113th Congress neared its midpoint, identical legislation, the World War I Memorial Act of 2014 (S. 2264; H.R. 4489), was introduced by McCaskill in the Senate and Cleaver in the House. Like the Poe legislation, the bills designated the Liberty Memorial as \\"a\\" National World War I Museum and Memorial. The bills also authorized a National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. But unlike the Poe bill, the McCaskill/Cleaver legislation authorized the World War I Centennial Commission to oversee design and construction of this memorial, and specified that it should be built in Pershing Park. The bills specifically barred the National World War I Memorial from interfering or encroaching on the D.C. memorial, which won them the backing of Delegate Norton, D.C. Council chair Phil Mendelson, and the World War I Centennial Commission—which had recommended the site. The memorial would cost about $10 million, and retain the Pershing commemorative work already at the site. Edwin Fountain, now a member of the World War I Centennial Commission, pledged an open design competition and said that, if the legislation passed, the commission would seek to have the memorial completed by November 11, 2018—the centennial of the closing date of the war. Both bills were bitterly opposed by the World War I Memorial Foundation. Its president, David DeJonge, pressed for construction on the National Mall. Construction at Pershing Park, he said, \\"will contribute to a systematic extinction to the memory of World War I ... I think [this] is a grievous error.\\" With action on both the bills stalled, time was running out in the 113th Congress for action. McCaskill and Cleaver believed that if a memorial was to be built in time for the anniversary of the end of the war in November 2018, authorization of a D.C. memorial could no longer wait. Cleaver and Poe met at the end of the first session of the 113th Congress, and Poe agreed to abandon his legislative proposal so that a memorial could be built in time for the war's centennial. Cleaver conceived the idea of inserting the bill's language into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2015. This bill, H.R. 4435, was introduced in the House on April 9. When it reached the House floor in May, Cleaver and Poe successfully co-sponsored an amendment to insert the memorial language into the bill. On December 2, the language of S. 2264/H.R. 4489 was again inserted into the defense bill as Subtitle J of Title XXX of Division B of H.R. 3979, the Carl Levin and Howard P. \\"Buck\\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. H.R. 3979 had passed the House on March 11, and the Senate on April 7. After extensive debate and amendments, the House adopted the measure on December 3, and the Senate on December 12. President Obama signed the legislation into law on December 19, 2014 (P.L. 113-291). With passage of the bill, the World War I Memorial Foundation suspended its effort to place the memorial on the National Mall. =Design competition= Aerial view of Pershing Park, taken about 2014. On May 20, 2015, the World War I Centennial Commission launched a design competition for the National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. The competition for the memorial, which the commission said should cost $21 million to $25 million, contained two phases. In Phase I, any member of the public from any country in the world could submit a sketch and 250-word design proposal (along with a $100 submission fee). The deadline for submissions was July 21, 2015. A jury would select the three to five best entries, each of which would receive a $25,000 honorarium. The finalists, who would be announced on August 4, 2015, would proceed to Phase II, where they would be required to pair with a professional design firm to flesh out their design and present it formally to the World War I Centennial Commission. The Centennial Commission said it would pick a winner by January 2016. The commission hoped to have a ground-breaking for the memorial on November 11, 2017 (Veterans Day in the United States). The memorial site drew criticism in August 2015. Architect M. Paul Friedberg, who designed Pershing Park, told the newspaper Stars and Stripes that he was deeply upset by plans to destroy or radically change the park and threatened legal and other actions to have it preserved. Landscape architect Charles Birnbaum, founder and president of the Cultural Landscape Foundation, called Pershing Park Friedberg's \\"seminal work\\", and began a petition to have the park added to the National Register of Historic Places to protect it. The jury was selected by members of the World War I Centennial Commission. The members of the jury were: * Ethan Carr, Ph.D., FASLA – professor of landscape architecture at the University of Massachusetts Amherst * Maurice Cox, FAIA – architect and urban design and planning expert * Benjamin Forgey – journalist, author, and former architecture critic for The Washington Post. * Harry G. Robinson III, FAIA – Dean Emeritus of the School of Architecture and Design at Howard University and former chairman of the United States Commission of Fine Arts * John F. Shortal, Ph.D. – Brigadier General in the United States Army (retired) chief historian for the Joint Chiefs of Staff * Allison Williams, FAIA – architect and design director for AECOM * Jennifer Wingate, Ph.D. – Associate Professor of Fine Arts at St. Francis College On August 19, 2015, the jury picked by the National World War I Memorial Commission announced the five finalist designs for the memorial. They are: *\\"An American Family Portrait\\", by STL Architects, Chicago, Illinois. *\\"Heroes Green\\", by Counts Studio, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. *\\"Plaza to the Forgotten War\\", by Johnsen Schmaling Architects, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. *\\"The Weight of Sacrifice\\", by Joseph Weishaar of Brininstool+Lynch, Chicago, Illinois. *\\"World War One Memorial Concept\\", by Kimmel Studio, Annapolis, Maryland. The five finalists made formal submissions to the National World War I Memorial Commission in December 2015. The commission, in January 2016, selected \\"The Weight of Sacrifice\\", by Joseph Weishaar, a 25-year-old architect who graduated from the University of Arkansas. He developed the design while he was an intern. Also selected was sculptor Sabin Howard, landscape architect Phoebe Lickwar (FORGE Landscape Architecture), and GWWO Inc./Architects. =Design reviews= In early November 2015, the National World War I Memorial Commission submitted the five finalist designs to the Commission of Fine Arts for its advice and approval. But the agency had strong criticisms of each of the designs. In a letter to the memorial commission, Commission of Fine Arts Secretary Thomas Luebke wrote that \\"the competition designs appear to proceed from the underlying assumption that the existing park design is a failure, whereas its problems are the direct result of inadequate maintenance. They commented that many features of the park—such as the berms and other topographical elements which help create a sheltered space at the center of the park and which are eliminated in most of these schemes—are the very characteristics of the design that make the existing park an appropriate setting for a contemplative memorial. Thus, they criticized the competition program for understating the value and importance of the existing park design, and they encouraged conceiving of the project as a new memorial within an existing park.\\" Washington City Paper reporter Kriston Capps noted that \\"none of the five finalist designs comes close to complying with the wishes of the CFA\\", but that it was still too early to say if the design process needed to be restarted. The National Capital Planning Commission, the other federal agency with approval authority over the memorial, was scheduled to review the five designs on December 3, 2015. =Commission of Fine Arts approval= On July 19, 2018, the Commission of Fine Arts gave its approval to a modified memorial design. The changes replaced the existing fountain with a stand-alone wall featuring high-relief sculptures facing east. A cascade down the western side of the wall fed a scrim (which replaced the existing pool). Design approval by the NCPC and other agencies was still pending. By Veterans Day of 2018, the Centennial Commission said it had raised $20 million of the projected $40 million cost of the memorial. The organization was still aiming to dedicate the memorial in November 2021. In December 2019, it was announced that the memorial had received its building permit and work was set to begin. The first phase of the project includes rebuilding the existing park, with the addition of a peace fountain, pool basin, multiple berms and plazas and groves of trees. Rockville-based Grunley Construction Co. is the project's general contractor. =Groundbreaking= On November 9, 2017, the World War I Centennial Commission held a ceremonial groundbreaking event at Pershing Park. United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley, and others participated in the groundbreaking.

The consortium produces a consistent global economic database (the GTAP Data Base) which is widely used in the research community to study prospective international economic policy around these issues. While the consortium includes a large number of international organizations, GTAP itself is coordinated by the Center for Global Trade Analysis, located at Purdue University.  GTAP consortium and data base  Founded by Thomas Hertel in 1992, the project grew out of the Australian IMPACT and SALTER modelling projects, and was heavily influenced by Alan Powell. It is currently directed by Dominique van der Mensbrugghe. A central element of GTAP is a large-scale database that is updated periodically by the consortium members, under coordination of the Center for Global Trade Analysis. The data are important, core structural inputs to a broad range of global economic policy models and related applications: studies of climate change and resource use (including studies feeding into the IPCC process); regional economic integration; and the effects of globalization. For this reason, the consortium membership (those contributing to the database) includes prominent global governance and policy research institutions like the World Bank, European Commission, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. There are currently three \\"Consortium Members At Large\\" – Joseph Francois, Mark Horridge, and Brian O'Neill, who represent the broader scientific community. The primary database is essentially a multi-year form of a multi-region input output (MRIO) database supplemented by national macroeconomic data, though extensive satellite datasets cover other measures that are linked to the economic flows in the core database, including trade policies, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, migration flows, and land use patterns. While from its inception the database was closely tied to the computable general equilibrium (CGE) research community, in recent years the database has also been at the center of greenhouse gas emissions accounting exercises, and related assessments of resource use.  Other activities  In addition to the multinational effort needed to update and expand the project database, the Center for Global Trade Analysis also offers courses on practical, model-based economic policy analysis. This includes courses on basic computational modelling and dynamic general equilibrium modelling. The standard GTAP Model, which serves as a maquete or framework model linking the database to a basic general equilibrium system, was developed with the GEMPACK suite of software but is also implemented using the GAMS suite of software. The Center also organizes a large-scale annual conference on global economic policy modelling. The Center also provides awards and recognition to members of the research community, including the Alan A. Powell Award and the GTAP Research Fellow awards.

They have been treated historically as a family Colydiidae, but have been moved into the Zopheridae, where they constitute the bulk of the diversity of the newly expanded family, with about 140 genera worldwide. They are diverse for example in the Australian region, from where about 35 genera are known; in Europe, though, only 20 genera are found and many of these only with few species. (2002): [Colydiinae].

Most feed on fungi, others are carnivores and eat small arthropods such as bark beetles. (1987): Beetles of Australia. Angus and Robertson, North Ryde, New South Wales. Systematics and taxonomy Up to 9 tribes are accepted by various authors; others, however, synonymize some of these. Formerly, many additional tribes were recognized, but the Synchitini, for example, are today generally held to include a number of these tribes, and are even sometimes merged into the Colydiini. Whether Pycnomerus terebrans of the \\"Pycnomerini\\" is a cylindrical bark beetle is not yet resolved The tribes are: * Acropini * Adimerini * Colydiini Billberg, 1820 * Gempylodini * Nematidiini * Orthocerini Blanchard, 1845 (= Sarrotriini Billberg, 1820 (nom. rej.)) * Rhagoderini * Rhopalocerini * Synchitini Erichson, 1845 (sometimes in Colydiini) Delimitation of the Colydiinae against the other lineages of Zopheridae is usually unproblematic. The only significant case of dispute may be the Pycnomerini, which is a small lineage of Zopheridae incertae sedis and was formerly considered an independent family like the \\"Colydiidae\\". That treatment is almost certainly wrong, but whether these beetles should be placed in Zopheridae as an additional subfamily Pycnomerinae, or treated as tribe Pycnomerini - and if the latter, whether they are better included in the Colydiinae or the Zopherinae - is still disputed. =Selected genera= Genera of cylindrical bark beetles include: Colydium elongatum of the tribe Colydiini Orthocerus clavicornis of the disputed tribe Orthocerini Synchita variegata of the disputed tribe Synchitini * Ablabus Broun, 1880 * Acolobicus * Acolophoides Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Acolophus Sharp, 1885 * Acostonotus Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Acropis Burmeister, 1840 * Afrorthocerus * Allobitoma Broun, 1921 * Alluauditoma * Anosyana * Antilissus Sharp, 1879 * Ascomma * Asprotera * Asynchita * Atyscus * Aulonium Erichson, 1845 * Bhutania * Bitoma Herbst, 1793 * Bolcocius Dajoz, 1977 * Bulasconotus Ślipiński & Lawrence, 1997 * Bupala * Cacotarphius * Caprodes Pascoe, 1863 * Catolaemus * Cebia Pascoe, 1863 * Cerchanotus Erichson, 1845 * Chorasus Sharp, 1882 (including Vitiacus) * Cicablabus Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Cicones * Ciconissus Broun, 1893 (including Caanthus) * Colobicones Grouvelle, 1918 * Colobicus Latreille, 1807 * Colydium Fabricius, 1792 * Colydodes * Corticus Germar, 1824 * Coxelus Dejean, 1821 * Dechomus * Denophloeus * Diodesma Latreille, 1829 * Diplagia Reitter, 1882 * Diplotoma * Ditomoidea * Emilka * Endeitoma Sharp, 1894 * Endocoxelus * Endophloeus Dejean, 1834 * Enhypnon Carter, 1919 * Epistranodes Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Epistranus Sharp, 1878 * Erylus * Eucicones * Eudesma * Eulachus * Faecula Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Fenerivia * Gempylodes Pascoe 1863 * Glenentela Broun, 1893 * Glyphocryptus Sharp, [1885] * Helioctamenus Schaufuss, 1882 * Heterargus Sharp, 1886 (including Gathocles, Protarphius) * Holopleuridia * Hyberis * Hybonotus Ślipiński & Lawrence, 1997 * Hystricones * Isotarphius * Kanantsia * Labrotrichus * Langelandia Aubé, 1843 * Lascobitoma Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Lasconotus Erichson, 1845 * Lascotonus * Lascotrichus * Lastrema Reitter, 1882 * Linophloeus * Lobogestoria * Lobomesa Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Lyreus Aubé, 1861 * Madacones * Madadesia * Madenphloeus * Mamakius * Megataphrus * Microprius Fairmaire, 1868 * Microsicus * Mnionychus * Monoedus Horn, 1882 (including Adimerus) * Munaria Reitter, 1882 * Namunaria Reitter, 1882 (including Sympanotus) * Nematidium Erichson, 1845 * Neotrichus Sharp, 1885 * Niphopelta Reitter, 1882 * Norix Broun, 1893 * Nosodomodes Reitter, 1922 * Notocoxelus Ślipiński & Lawrence, 1997 * Orthocerus Latreille, 1796 (including Sarrotrium) * Paha * Paratarphius * Paryphus * Pharax * Phloeodalis * Phloeonemus * Phormesa * Phorminx Carter & Zeck, 1937 * Phreatus * Priolomopsis * Priolomus * Pristoderus Hope, 1840 (including Dryptops, Enarsus, Recyntus, Sparactus) * Prosteca Wollaston, 1860 * Pseudendestes Lawrence, 1980 * Pseudocorticus * Pseudotarphius * Rechodes * Rhagodera Mannerheim 1843 * Rhopalocerus Redtenbacher, 1842 * Rytinotus Broun, 1880 * Sallachius * Sassaka * Sechellotoma * Sprecodes * Synagathis Carter & Zeck, 1937 * Syncalus Sharp, 1876 (including Acosmetus) * Synchita Hellwig, 1792 * Tarphiablabus Ślipiński & Lawrence, 1997 * Tarphiomimus Wollaston, 1873 * Tarphiosoma * Tarphius Erichson, 1845 * Tentablabus Slipinski & Lawrence, 1997 * Todima Grouvelle, 1893 * Todimopsis Ślipiński & Lawrence, 1997 * Trachypholis Erichson, 1845 * Trigonophloeus * Xylolaemus Redtenbacher, 1858 * Zanclea The genera Pycnomerodes, Pycnomerus and Rhizonium are sometimes included in the Colydiinae too.

The school is one of several state high schools in Toowoomba, including Toowoomba State High School , Harristown State High School and Wilsonton State High School. History Centenary Heights State High School was founded in 1968, as a coeducational institution, with an initial enrolment of 168 students. The construction for the main building was commenced in 1967 and completed in 1968. In 1990 the school began works on upgrading its dirt ovals to grass ovals to reduce student injuries. Due to budget constraints the school only managed to upgrade one of its three ovals. In 2008, the school began a A$5 million project to upgrade the library into a multi-resource centre for the students and the community, and this was completed in 2009. The facility consists of a study hall with computer facilities, thousands of books, and six rooms where students or the community can study or meet. In 2015 the school integrated the Flying Start program, meaning that year seven students would now be enrolled at the school. In response to the growth of the school by roughly 250 students, a large year seven building was built, and it incorporated a range of facilities that were completely new to the school. The school's principal from 2003 was Maryanne Walsh. She had previously been the principal of Toowoomba High School from 2000 to 2003. In 2010 she appeared on the Channel 7 breakfast show Sunrise in relation to the Toowoomba Flexi School program. Facilities As of 2010 the school's facilities were as follows: *twenty- seven general classrooms; *library; *special education unit and classroom; *six computer rooms; *six science rooms; *home economics block; *manual arts/ITD block; *music block; *art block; *film and television editing room; *drama room; *tuckshop; *sporting facilities, including tennis courts, hall, ovals, gym, basketball courts, and a 25-metre indoor swimming pool. *LOTE block *Refently constructured W block (grade 7s only); *Caldwell Performing Arts Centre Curriculum The school offers students many subject choices. Students from Year 8 to Year 10 undertake core studies in Mathematics, English, Science, and Studies of Society and Environment (SOSE), as well a variety of other subjects from the arts, languages other than English, business studies, Information and communications technology, and practical areas. Year 11 and 12 Subjects are more diverse and allow students a greater choice in electives. Most of these subjects are Overall Position (OP) eligible, but some are OP Ineligible and SATS subjects. Students in Year 12 also are required to undertake Queensland Core Skills Test (QCS) practice and the QCS (Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE)). This helps determine the student's OP and the school's progress. Community and clubs Centenary offers many extracurricular activities and clubs. These include Student council, Rotary Interact, Peer support, Peer Mediation, debating, Eco-action, Harmony Week and Day, ski trip, Relay For Life, Book Trailer Club and Toastmasters. The student council consists of two representatives from every year level, a secretary, treasurer, president and vice-president. Their purpose is to raise money for projects throughout the school, including bubblers, bins, and furniture. The Rotary Interact Club is supported by the Toowoomba South Rotary International Club, and raises money for community organisations and charities, including Lifeline and Jeans for Genes day. Centenary's Parents and Citizens Association spends the money raised by these events on the school's facilities. The most recent additions include the terrace shade structure and the prepaid tuckshop counter. The Parents and Citizens Association is currently run by its president Wayne Heading, who was elected in March 2014. Sports Centenary Heights State High School offers students a diverse range of sports.

The Present Hall View of the Present Manor House of 1668 at Soulton The manor of Soulton is pre-Norman in origin. What can be seen externally of the present hall is constructed of brick, produced at the site in a field now known as \\"the Brickle\\", a corruption of \\"Brick Kiln\\", with Grinshill stone dressings. The present exterior of the building was constructed in approximately 1668, but incorporates some hidden older structures. However in incorporates within the building traces of an older Tudor or medieval building of timber frame construction, which would have been of considerable extent for its time: four stories high, of three bays, and containing close stud work. Some of the timbers even within this structure were reused from a yet older building. Coat of Arms added above the front door in 1668The hall of the 1550s which can be seen today was built by Sir Rowland Hill (MP), who was the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London in 1549, and, as Sheriff of London, was involved in the case which established Parliamentary Privilege. It has been speculated that this building was the work of Walter Hancock, who built the Old Market Hall in Shrewsbury. The manors of Hawkstone and Soulton were sold in 1556 by Thomas Lodge to Sir Rowland Hill and Thomas Leigh under long leases (until 1610) for quiet enjoyment by his brother Edward Lodge.The National Archives, Discovery Catalogue piece description 'Bargain and sale (1556)', 215/31 (Shropshire Archives). Within the building are traces of an older Tudor or medieval building of timber frame construction, thought to date from the late 15th century. Examples of simple pargeting on this earlier building can be seen within the building. In 1668 a semi-circular pediment bearing the marital coat of arms of Thomas Hill, a descendant of Sir Rowland's and a friend of Samuel Pepys, was added above the front door. The blazon on those arms is given below. There are said to be masonic influences in this semi-circular pediment, and the hall's cubic appearance may be an early re-interpretation of Vitruvian ideas. To the east of the hall is a walled garden, accessed by steps from the terrace on the north, or by a small gate to the north. At the front of the hall is a Pillared forecourt, again part of the 1550s design concept. Associated Buildings and Features Within the grounds of the hall are thought to be the remains of extensive medieval gardens although it is possible that the obvious forms in the fields near the hall may be the remains of a deserted medieval village. These are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. There are also some 18th-century farm buildings, of which a range of buildings now known as Soulton Court, which has a stone tablet dated 1783 relating to later work, incorporates a manorial moot hall of unknown date prior to the mid-1600s. A dovecot once existed to the east of the garden wall, it had been dismantled by the end of the 1800s. History of the Manor =Saxon and earlier= Within the manor is evidence Bronze Age habitation, and some signs of Neolithic activity. The name of the manor is Saxon and means either 'settlement with a plough' or 'settlement with reeds' or possibly 'settlement in/near a gully' . The manor of Soulton existed at the time of the Domesday Book (see: PASE Domesday) and is recorded as \\"Svltune\\". The Domesday Book records the manor as being freely held by Brihtric, the brother of Eadric Streona, who was the Ealdorman of Mercia. Both Brihtric and Eadric were slain by King Cnut on Christmas Day, 1017. =Post Norman= The building on the present site was pre-dated by Saxon ane perhaps earlier structures. A Norman Adulterine castle was constructed approximately 300 meters to the north-east of the hall during the Anarchy in the early 1100s. The manor supported the clergy of the King's Chapel of St Micheal in Shrewsbury Castle. The manor house has probably always occupied the current site with this fortification only being used for military and not domestic purposes. The location is marked by a mound which can still be seen. This site is located around the point at which the roadway crosses a narrow gap in some wet terrain which would likely have had a strategic reason for establishing a fortification in that location. This building is believed to have burnt down at some point in the late 14th century. A grant of the manor in 1299 indicates that some of the ancient marker posts marking the boundary with Wales were part of the boundary of the manor. =Post 1556= The present hall, described above was built in 1556, remodelling the surviving the earlier hall. There is an 1801 Thomas Telford bridge on the B5065 known as Soulton Bridge.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-427941-soulton-bridge-wem- rural- There are also the remains of a water mill active from at least the 1300s until the mid-to-late 1800s. Modern Monolithic Monuments  The Modern Barrow at Soulton = Long Barrow = A modern long barrow, Soulton Long Barrow, is under construction on farmland north of Soulton Hall. The site became operational in 2019. The new monument was covered on an episode of BBC Countryfile being visited by Matt Baker and Ellie Harrison in April 2019. = Standing Stones = Three megalithic limestone standing stones are located on the access route to the barrow. These were added to the approach route to the barrow in autumn 2017. The stone for these monoliths, as with the barrow itself came from Churchfield Quarry, Oundle, near Peterborough. There is no deliberate alignment beyond way-marking for these standing stones. In 2020, a standing stone, with an alignment to the setting sun on the winter solstice, was added to the ritual landscape to acknowledged the suffering of the families impacted by the Coronavirus Pandemic. = Henge Monument = Plans for a henge monument were publicised in 2020. = Sanctuary Theatre = In 2020, partially as a response to the crisis in live performance and theatre resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, an outdoor performance area was added in front of the barrow. Farm View of farmland Soulton: a no-till crop of wheat looking to the woodland There is a farm at the manor, including Soulton Wood. The farm practices no-till farming. This was covered in an episode of BBC Countryfile in April 2019 with Matt Baker. Research cooperation between Harper Adams University and Oxford University looking at the results of cultivation on Soil ecology, which used DNA sequencing of the soil biome has been hosted on the farm.http://www.soultonhall.co.uk/news/27/no-till-biome- experiment-.htm The woodland is largely oak with some cherry and ash. In total the woodland covers about 50 acres and it is designated ancient woodland. Material from the wood was supplied for repair of the House of Commons after bomb damage in the Second World War.http://www.soultonhall.co.uk/page/150/soulton-wood.htm  Archaeology  The manor includes various protected archaeology. An official excavation with Dig Ventures took place in June 2019. Coat of arms rendering of the arms carved in stone above the front door of Soulton Hall in colour The blazen of the arms added above the front door in 1688 is as follows:http://www.soultonhall.co.uk/page/120/coat-of-arms.htm * Hill of Court of Hill ermine, on a fesse sable a triple towered castle argent * Hill of Longslow: Sable, a lion rampent argent, langued and armed, crowned or between three croffed fromee fitchee of the second; * Evans of Watstay, Co Denbigh Argent, a fesse between three fleur-de-lys, sable; * Eyton of Rhiwabon C Denbigh ermine, a lion rampant crowned or, langued and armed; * Bird of Charleton, per pale or and argent, an eale displayed, beaked and armed; * Hill of Buntinsdale; gules, a chevron between three pheons argent, points downwards; * Lloyd, (Bishop of St Asaph, 1680) argent, a chevron between three crows sable, each holding in its beak an ermine spot; * Grifith, Lord of Bromfield Play of eight argent and gules, a lion rampant sable;  Culture and Heritage  leftSoulton Hall is a Grade II* listed building, along with its walled gardens, pillared forecourt and carved stone work. Soulton Bridge, crossing Soulton Brook is a Grade I listed structure, built in 1801 by Thomas Telford. It is now a hotel and farm. It is still owned by descendants of Sir Rowland Hill. Some affinity both architectural, and by family connections has been attributed to Soulton with Rosewell (plantation) in Virginia. An eighteenth century dance, the Soulton Jigg, is linked to the manor and published in John Walsh's 1740 \\"The Second Book of the Compleat Country Dancing-Master\\". There is periodic filming at the manor.http://www.soultonhall.co.uk/page/70/film-location.htm = Spelling = Before the modern spelling of 'Soulton', a wide variation in spelling can be observed:http://placenames.org.uk/browse/mads/epns-deep-82-b-subparish-000108 * Suletune (Domesday Book, 1086) * Suleton' (Curia Regis Rolls 1200; Rotuli Hundredorum, 1255) * Soleton (Assize Rolls, 1271-2; Feudal Aids 1284-5A) * Sulton' (Assize Rolls 1271-2, 91-2) * Sulton (Feudal Aids 1431, 1470, 84; Calendar of Close Rolls Preserved in the Public Record Office, 1703; Shropshire Parish Registers, 1809) * Solton' (1334, The Shropshire Lay Subsidy Roll of 1 Edward III) * Sowton (Saxton's Map of Shropshire, 1695 The County Maps from William Camden's Britannia 1695 by Robert Morden) * Soughton; 1672, The Shropshire Hearth-Tax Roll of 1672) * Soulton (1677, Shropshire Parish Register) * Saulton (artifacts at the building, 1800s) Present Use The manor is now a hotel and venue.

The Coming Storm (the book), Paul Russell, 2000, 384 pages, , pp. 125, 350; web: BooksG-EC. The Coming Storm is set on the campus of a boys' University-preparatory school in upstate New York. Tracy Parker, a 25-year-old, is hired as an English teacher by the headmaster Louis Tremper. Tracy has a sexual relationship with a troubled 15-year-old student. The novel touches on the transience of youth, the challenges of illegal or unconventional love, and the tragedy of sexual obsession. Plot The story is told from the alternating perspective of four characters: Louis Tremper, the headmaster of a boy's prep school in upstate New York; his wife, Claire Tremper; Tracy Parker, the school's new 25-year-old English teacher; and Noah Lathrop III, a 15-year-old student struggling with his own sexuality. \\"The Coming Storm  Paul Russell  Macmillan\\", macmillan.com, 2010, webpage: Mac-CS. Headmaster Louis Tremper is a repressed homosexual with a love of German opera. He hires Tracy as an English teacher at the school, Middle Forge, and is instantly attracted. He and his wife, Claire become close friends with Tracy, often inviting him over to dinner, with Louis educating and imparting his love of classic music on the young English teacher. Louis, as headmaster, has a history of having favorite boys within the school, but the relationships always closely resembled that of his new friendship with Tracy Parker – a relationship similar to the one he himself had with Jack Emmerich, the school's previous headmaster. Claire has also developed a friendship with Tracy. Knowing full well of Louis' repressed desires, Claire accepts them knowing that even so, he has remained a faithful husband. She also admits to a lesbian crush when she was younger, with her best friend Libby, who is married to Reid. Louis and Reid have been friends for years, and it was through Reid that Claire had met Louis. It is implied that Louis had an unrequited love for Reid – who instead became a womanizer and an adulterer, eventually leaving his wife by the end of the novel. Tracy quickly becomes a popular teacher on campus, letting the students call him by his first name. He lives alone in a big house on campus; one that was previously owned by Jack Emmerich. He quickly befriends the Trempers. He and Claire visit a dog shelter where Tracy finds Betsy, a beagle which he occasionally leaves in the care of one of his students, Noah Lathrop III. Shortly after he starts teaching, he visits friends in New York City, where it is revealed that Tracy is gay. His ex-boyfriend, Arthur Branson, who is dying of AIDS, was also formerly a student of Middle Forge, and at the time, had been one of Louis' favored students. Later it is revealed that Arthur was in an illicit relationship of his own with the school's previous headmaster, Jack Emmerich. Noah is a troubled student who was sent to Middle Forge after having developed a crush on a teacher in his previous school. His father, Noah Lathrop II, is an overbearing alpha male running dubious business deals around the world. He's a coke fiend who has little time for his son, and is oblivious to what goes on his son's life. Noah III often sees the school counselor, wets the bed, and is on Ritalin. During a trip home to New York, he runs into Christian Tyler, a boy maliciously teased by the other boys in their dorm. Christian is gay, HIV-positive, and in a relationship with a 40-year-old doctor. Noah has his first gay experience with Chris, and eventually the boys become close friends. Early on, Louis suspects the relationship between Tracy and Noah has grown too close – only it's not until a few months later, after many overtures by Noah, that Tracy finally gives in to his desires. They see each other clandestinely for a couple of months, until the headmaster finds out, and everything begins to unravel, including the history of what happened with Arthur Branson and Jack Emmerich and how it ruined their lives as well as Louis' life. Louis stepped in to stop the relationship, but then turned his back on Arthur when Arthur declared his homosexuality. When Tracy invited him back to the school to have dinner with the Trempers, Louis now realizes that Tracy is gay and turns his back on Tracy for the same reason. Claire eventually re-ignites her own friendship with Tracy, during which he confides in her about his forbidden relationship with Noah. History repeats itself when Tracy panics and finally breaks off the relationship (with Noah) he knows he never should have started. Noah, feeling hurt and rejected runs away with Betsy to New York. While wandering the city at night, he loses Betsy in Central Park. Tracy finally comes clean to Louis, about the teacher-student relationship with Noah, and offers his resignation, which Louis accepts. Louis prepares to, once again, clean up the mess caused by a forbidden relationship between teacher and student. Eventually, Noah is brought back to school by his father, who is unaware that any drama other than a lost dog has occurred. Tracy's actions are kept secret, though he still resigns his teaching position. The novel ends with Louis, the headmaster, feeling that once again he has failed the person in the situation who needed protecting most, Noah. Claire urges him to look out for the boy, since no one else will. Tracy has left the school and gone back to New York, having completely cut off any contact with the Trempers, the school, and Noah. Though Noah never says anything to his father or anyone else who might do something, Tracy nonetheless now realizes that he will spend the rest of his life feeling guilty, not for loving the boy, but for acting on it when he knew better; and not knowing if has irrevocably damaged Noah in the same way that Jack Emmerich (and inadvertently Louis) had damaged Arthur. Unlike the three adults – Louis, Claire, and Tracy – who are left pondering their regrets and mistakes, it is Noah who gets the happy ending. Finally coming to terms with who he is, he tests negative for HIV, is no longer angry at Tracy for ending their relationship, and has finally accepted himself for who he is. He and fellow student Chris Tyler start a club for gays on campus, which allows Noah the chance to finally admit his homosexuality openly for the first time. The club is run with Louis' blessing, and the novel ends with Noah realizing that unlike Arthur, his own experiences have helped him find himself and that there is hope that his own future will be brighter and happier than Tracy and Arthur, or Louis and Claire.

Name In Yer. Hag. II 76d he is called Mattai of Arbela, which is also found in ancient and linguistically reliable manuscripts of the Mishnah, such as Codex Kaufmann, Codex Parma A and the Cambridge Codex (edited by W. H. Lowe). The confusion in the rendering of his name seems to be due to faulty textual transmission, i.e. the Hebrew mem being separated graphically into two parts, which looked, respectively as a nun and a yod, thus Mattai became Nittai. Arbela was a city of the Galilee not far from Tiberias. Teachings No halakhot of his are extant, but some of his apothegms have been preserved in such sources as Pirkei Avot; these afford a glimpse of his character, to wit: \\"Distance thyself from a bad neighbor; consort not with an evil man, nor despair at tribulation.\\"Avot i.7. These bitter utterances contrast sharply with the gentle maxims of his colleague Joshua ben Perachyah. Nittai seems to have spoken thus after John Hyrcanus had deserted the party of the Pharisees and joined the Sadducees, persecuting his former friends. The phrase \\"renounce not the hope of retribution\\" was perhaps intended to comfort the Pharisees with the thought that Hyrcanus himself would not escape punishment, while the other two injunctions were designed maybe to keep them from joining the Sadducees.

Biography Kleiberg was born in Stavanger in 1958. He graduated from the University of Oslo with a degree in musicology and later from the Norwegian Academy of Music with a diploma degree in composition. In addition he has studied in England. Kleiberg has worked as a composer since 1981 when he received his first commission. He was appointed associate professor at the department of music at the University of Trondheim in 1986, and professor of music at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in 2008. Works Kleiberg's output ranges from chamber music to works for full orchestra; a number of these are the result of commissions from leading orchestras and ensembles. Kleiberg's works are often to be found on concert programmes. His 'Dopo' for cello and string orchestra was included on the TrondheimSoloist's recent tour of England. In the British journal 'Tempo' this work is described as having '...made a deep and lasting impression' and that 'Kleiberg weaves an angry expressionistic line of immense power and virtuosity'. Among his works for full orchestra is the symphony ‘Klokkeskjæret’ (‘The Bell Reef’), commissioned by the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra. Kleiberg has also completed a number of major works commissioned by the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, and was their composer-in-residence for the 2000/2001 season. Three of his works that were performed during that season have been recorded on a portrait CD with Kleiberg's orchestral music. Another portrait CD features five of his chamber works, and he is also represented at other recordings with single pieces. 'Requiem – for victims of Nazi persecution' is a central work in Kleiberg's production. In addition to the parts from the Latin Mass, new texts by the Scottish poet and play writer Edwin Morgan are included. This trilogy also includes the orchestral work 'Lamento: Cissi Klein in memoriam' and 'Dopo'. Many of Kleiberg's works have a literary source. Poetic images often give rise to musical associations, and these imagined sounds and sound-textures form the basis of the inspiration for the composer's work. One excellent example of this is the hour-long 'Rosevinduet' (‘The Rose Window’) for narrator and chamber orchestra, commissioned by the Olavsfestdagene in Trondheim in 1992, and later released on CD. 2015 saw Kleiberg's Mass for Modern Man premiered at Trondheim's Nidaros Cathedral as the opening concert of the St. Olav Festival, and the work saw its German premiere in Münchner Dom in November the same year. His opera oratory David and Bathsheba also saw a Nidaros Cathedral premiere in 2008 to critical acclaim and has since seen a number of international performances. Awards In 1999 Kleiberg was awarded the 'Fartein Valen Prize', and was composer-in-residence during the Valen Days the following year. Kleiberg has received two Grammy nominations: in 2009 for the album Treble and Bass with the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra and soloists Marianne Thorsen (violin) and Göran Sjölin (double bass) as well as the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra's 2013 recording of his opera David and Bathsheba.

Normally, a tour accountant will report to both the tour manager (for all matters regarding tour financial operations), and to the artist manager/business manager (for overall financial reporting). From a tour perspective, the tour accountant will normally: handle periodic financial transactions (either with artist management, or promoter), including per diem draw, wire transfers of both direct (promoter > artist management) and indirect (promoter > tour accountant > artist management; usually box office receipts collected at settlement by tour accountant) funds, per diem distribution, hotel settlement, currency exchange (international tours), negotiate all local tax issues (concerning artist earnings in each individual local market), and constantly work to clear up any \\"grey areas\\" during the advance, that have the potential to affect show settlement. Although normally, tour members will be paid by either artist management/business management, or accounting firm, the tour accountant will act as the \\"conduit\\" between the parties, while the tour is operating. If a tour is not large enough to warrant utilizing a tour accountant, the tour manager will normally assume his/her responsibilities, as listed above. Generally, the only exception to this is if artist management travels with tour, and opts to handle the aforementioned. The path to becoming a tour accountant usually involves either advancement through the ranks (a great deal of experience with a specific artist, or artist management company), or via a more traditional route (secondary, post secondary education and degree, followed by employment with either artist management company, or specialized entertainment accounting company).

Whiddon was born in Newville, Alabama. He was a graduate of Birmingham-Southern College (B.A., 1952) and Emory University (Ph.D., 1963). He held the position of dean of students at Athens State College in Athens, Alabama, when he took the job as director of the University of Alabama's extension service in Mobile. Whiddon then spearheaded the drive to create an autonomous new university in Mobile. That university was officially begun in 1963 and taught its first classes in 1964. Whiddon's 35-year tenure as the president of the University of South Alabama was marked by dramatic growth. The university came to comprise nine colleges and schools. One of those, the College of Medicine, opened in 1972 as the state's second medical school and re-established Mobile as a center of physician training in Alabama, a position it held as a monopoly until the early 20th century, when Alabama's original medical school (located in Mobile) closed. Whiddon also founded the University of South Alabama Foundation to support the university's mission. The foundation amassed a huge endowment by the 1990s, primarily by depositing federal and state reimbursements to the university for medical services performed at its hospitals. After this technique became the subject of a lawsuit, the university and the USA Foundation agreed to spend the medical reimbursements only for medical-related purposes and to refrain from further diversion of medical reimbursements into the foundation. Whiddon resigned as president of the University of South Alabama in 1998 under pressure from the university's board of trustees. He was succeeded by his long-time vice-president for services and planning, V. Gordon Moulton. Whiddon then became managing director of the USA Foundation. Under Whiddon the foundation was forced into protracted legal squabbling with the university over control of the foundation's assets and the timing and purposes for which they were being disbursed. A lawsuit was settled out-of-court in 2001; the settlement required the foundation to add new members to its board, including the president of the University of South Alabama, but it did not require the foundation to alter its asset allocation, management, or disbursements. Whiddon died in Mobile on May 1, 2002.  Sources  * \\"Dr. Fred Whiddon of Newville\\", Henry County Tidings, Vol. IV, No. 41, by T.

The centerpiece of the park is a ride on a train pulled by one of Tweetsie Railroad's two historic narrow-gauge steam locomotives. The park also features a variety of amusement rides, live shows, a zoo and other attractions geared towards families with children. The park also hosts a variety of special events throughout the year including their Halloween and Christmas themed events. Park history One of Tweetsie Railroad's two steam locomotives, 2-8-2 #190, on May 20th, 2007. Opened on July 4, 1957, Tweetsie Railroad began as an excursion train ride pulled by coal-fired steam locomotive #12, the only surviving narrow-gauge engine of the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET&WNC;). Built-in 1917 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, #12 is a narrow gauge coal-fired locomotive that ran from 1918 to 1940 carrying passengers and freight over the ET&WNC;'s line through the Appalachian Mountains from Johnson City, Tennessee to Boone, North Carolina. The name \\"Tweetsie\\" was given to the original ET&WNC; by area residents who became accustomed to the shrill \\"tweet, tweet\\" of the locomotive whistles that echoed through the mountains. The nickname stuck with the railroad and its trains and became more identifiable than the railroad's official name. On February 9, 2017, Locomotive #12 celebrated its 100th Birthday. An official ceremony was held for the locomotive during Tweetsie Railroad's Heritage Weekend on August 26, 2017. Two years after the narrow- gauge portion of the ET&WNC; ceased operations in 1950, the locomotive was purchased by a group of railroad enthusiasts and taken to Penn Laird, Virginia to operate as the Shenandoah Central Railroad, which opened in May 1953.Ties: the Southern Railway System Magazine, June 1953 - \\"Tweetsie\\" Rides the Rails Again Rains from Hurricane Hazel washed out the Shenandoah Central in October 1954, and Locomotive #12 was once again put up for sale. Cowboy actor and singer Gene Autry optioned the locomotive with the intent to move it to California for use in motion pictures. However, Autry ultimately determined that the transportation and restoration costs made his plan impractical. Grover Robbins, an entrepreneur from Blowing Rock, North Carolina, purchased Autry's option and bought the locomotive in August 1955. Robbins moved the #12 locomotive back to its native Blue Ridge Mountains as the centerpiece of a new \\"Tweetsie Railroad\\" tourist attraction. One mile of track was constructed near Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and on July 4, 1957, the locomotive made its first public trip over the line. In 1958, the track was extended to a 3-mile loop around the mountain, and the trains at Tweetsie Railroad have traveled that circuit ever since. Grover Robbins' brothers, Harry and Spencer, were also involved with the operation of Tweetsie Railroad, and the park is still controlled and operated by the Robbins family. In 1960, Tweetsie acquired another coal-fired steam locomotive, USATC S118 Class #190, the \\"Yukon Queen\\" from Alaska's White Pass and Yukon Route. Also built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1943 for the US Army, the engine was part of an 11-locomotive fleet of \\"MacArthur\\" 2-8-2s originally purchased for use overseas. During World War II, the locomotives were sent to Alaska for use on the White Pass and Yukon. Locomotive #190 celebrated its 75th birthday in 2018. Tweetsie Railroad became a popular tourist attraction, and quickly evolved into the first theme park in North Carolina—and one of the first in the nation. A western town and saloon were built around the original depot area. A train robbery and cowboy-and- Indian show were added to the train ride, playing off the Wild West theme that was very popular at the time on television and in movies. The theme was enhanced by regular visits from Charlotte's WBTV television personality/singing cowboy Fred Kirby, who hosted a popular children's show. In 1961, a chairlift and amusement ride area was constructed on the central mountain inside the rail loop, and over the decades the park has been expanded with additional rides, attractions, shops, zoo, and restaurants. Tweetsie Railroad is open from early April through October, and on select nights in late November through December for the Tweetsie Christmas event. In addition to the Wild West train adventure and the amusement rides, Tweetsie Railroad has a variety of live entertainment shows featuring talented performers selected from the immediate area and from the Southeast. The park hosts numerous special events each season, including Letterland-themed days in May for school groups, visits by Thomas the Tank Engine, and a very popular nighttime \\"Ghost Train\\" Halloween event in October. In 2017, Tweetsie Railroad's 60th anniversary season, the park introduced the \\"Tweetsie Christmas\\" holiday-themed event. In 1961, Grover and Harry Robbins built another train ride and tourist attraction called \\"Rebel Railroad\\" in the Smoky Mountains near Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Originally featuring a Civil War theme, the park was renamed \\"Goldrush Junction\\" in 1966 and re-themed to a Wild West concept very similar to Tweetsie Railroad. The Robbins brothers sold Goldrush Junction in the late 1960s, and it subsequently went through various owners. In 1976, Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Missouri bought the Pigeon Forge facility and redeveloped it as \\"Silver Dollar City\\". In 1986, country music star Dolly Parton became a part-owner with the Herschends, and the theme park became today's Dollywood.

It was created on December 21, 1936 under a government decree during the presidency of David Toro. YPFB is one of the biggest corporations in Bolivia. History YPFB was created in 1936 as a state-owned and run petrol company. During the first presidency of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, capitalized oil companies were formed from YPFB properties under the capitalization (privatization) reform. The companies were owned 80 percent by direct private investors and 20 percent by all the citizens of Bolivia over the age of 21 and resident in Bolivia. This was also the case with the capitalizations of the other four principal state-owned companies. YPFB remained at that time as a state-owned service company for the hydrocarbon sector. Since the election of president Evo Morales, the capitalized oil companies have been nationalized. Full ownership of the companies was returned to the state, and full control over development, extraction, and commercialization for the domestic and export markets of Bolivia's petroleum and natural gas was returned to each company.

The God Who Comes: Dionysian Mysteries Reclaimed. Algora Publishing, 2003.Walcot, Peter. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 98 1978: 188. It might also have been symbolic that the worshippers were internalizing Dionysus’ wilder traits and his association with brute nature, in a sort of “communion” with the god.Witt, R. E. The Classical Review, Vol. 22, No. 2 1972: 288. Mythology sometimes depicts Maenads, Dionysus' female worshippers, eating raw meat as part of their worship; however, there is little solid evidence that historical Maenads consumed raw meat.Henrichs, Albert. \\"Greek Maenadism from Lympias to Messalina.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 82 (1978): 121-169.Kraemer, Ross S. \\"Ecstasy and Possession: The Attraction of Women to the Cult of Dionysus.\\" The Harvard Theological Review, Vol. 72 60 Jan.-Apr. 1979. The Dionysiac diet of raw meat may be more properly attributed to Dionysus himself, rather than his followers—he received sacrifices of raw meat and was believed to consume them, but his followers did not share in the consumption.Henrichs, Albert. \\"Greek Maenadism from Lympias to Messalina.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 82 (1978): 150-151.

Zagreus was the child of Zeus and Persephone, who was torn apart by the Titans in an act of sparagmos. After tearing Zagreus apart, the Titans devoured him, except for his heart. His body was then reassembled; this may be reflected in the story of Pentheus, whose body parts were gathered together after his mother, aunt and other Maenads tore him apart in a Dionysic frenzy, and the story of Actaeon, who was eaten by his own hunting dogs. Because the dogs grieved so deeply after Actaeon's death, an image of him was made to comfort them. All three stories show a common motif of reassembly of body parts following sparagmos and omophagia, and this motif may have been significant for religious ritual.Henrichs, Albert. \\"Greek Maenadism from Lympias to Messalina.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 82 (1978): 148. In Orphism, worshippers took part in an Orphic ritual which reenacted the story of Zegreus, using a bull as their victim (poorer worshippers may have used a goat instead).Tierney, Michael. \\"A New Ritual of the Orphic Mysteries.\\" The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 16, No. 2 April 1922: 80. They considered the ritual to be \\"commemorative\\" of events in their god's existence.

Dionysus became associated with Zagreus, and the story of having been torn apart and eaten by the Titans was applied to him as well. Omophagia was the focus of the Dionysiac mysteries, and a component of Orphic ceremonies.Tierney, Michael. \\"A New Ritual of the Orphic Mysteries.\\" The Classical Quarterly, Vol. 16, No. 2 April 1922: 79. In its beginnings, Orphism was influenced by the Eleusinian mysteries, and it adopted stories from other mythologies as its own. The worshippers of Zagreus may have engaged in omophagia as an initiation rite.Henrichs, Albert. \\"Greek Maenadism from Lympias to Messalina.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 82 (1978): 151. The Bacchae Euripides’ play The Bacchae focuses on the worship of Dionysus, including allusions to omophagia, and its companion sparagmos. In this play, the character Agave tears her son Pentheus apart while under the influence of Dionysus. Because Euripides depicts Agave as engaging in sparagmos, he likely intended for the audiences to assume she engaged in omophagia as well: additionally, the character Cadmus compares Agave's actions to the story of Actaeon, who was consumed by his own hunting dogs—this association further suggests that omophagia took place.Devereux, G. \\"The Psychotherapy Scene in Euripiedes' Bacchae.\\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 90 1970: 35-48. There is another possible instance of omophagia in The Bacchae. At one point in the play, the maenads go into a nearby town and carry off the children; it is possible that the maenads then consumed them. In art and myth, this incident is linked to omophagia; however, Euripides may not have intended this meaning in The Bacchae.Seaford, Richard. \\"Review: Bacchae.\\" The Classical Review, New Series, Vol. 36, No. 1 1986: 26.

It is part of the Val di Sangro mountain community. It is the largest municipality in the province by extension and eighth by population.  Geography  The town is located in the lower valley of the Sangro river. Its area, with its 11,003 hectares, is the largest in the province and includes a small part decentralized from the rest of the territory, south of the hamlet of Tornareccio. It includes a series of promontories that reach the vast floodplain of the Sangro. The village of Atessa winds on top of a relief from the crescent-shaped plant, isolated on the surrounding countryside, whose highest point is 473 meters, at the Villa Comunale. The watercourses that run through the municipal territory are numerous, mostly tributaries of the main rivers, the Sangro to the west and the Osento to the east. The subsoil consists of one of the last ridges where there are ancient stratified sandy deposits, visible in the numerous outcrops of the escarpments, with an ocher-yellow color. These sediments, evidence of the permanence of the coastline in this place and the following regression of the sea between the end of the Pliocene and the beginning of the Quaternary, rest on clayey soils (blue-gray clays), the result of the sedimentation in the open sea of terrigenous materials . The large hills are thus constituted, on which are found the majority of the districts, connected by a dense network of secondary roads to the most important ones of the valley bottom. History The origins of Atessa according to some sources date back to the fifth century AD, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages it was a fief of various lords including: the Courtenay or Cortinaccio, Philip I of Flanders, the Maramonte, the Counts of Monteodorisio, king Ferdinand I of Naples and the Colonna. After the abolishment of feudalism in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (early 19th century), the land was in misery. There was a brief recovery, but a subsequent cholera epidemic that hit the area between 1816 and 1817 deprived it of any improvement.  Main sights  Colun of St. Christopher. Convent of San Pasquale. The city preserves the historical center in 17th-century, late Renaissance style, with few remains of the ancient medieval walls in the urban gates of San Michele, San Giuseppe, San Nicola and Santa Margherita.

Located in Allegan County's Manlius Township, it connected 57th Street with Old Allegan Road over the Kalamazoo River until its closure to vehicular traffic. The name New Richmond comes from a former mining town in the area of the same name. The bridge is one of the oldest - if not the oldest - swing bridges extant in the United States, and is one of the oldest metal truss bridges in the state of Michigan and the state's longest pony truss bridge. History The first bridge to cross the Kalamazoo River at this location was constructed in 1842, as part of a local highway connecting Allegan with the now-defunct village of Singapore. The 1842 wooden drawbridge was replaced in 1856 with a similar structure. In 1877, part of this bridge collapsed into the river, and by late 1878, preparations were being made to tear down the wooden bridge and replace it with an iron one. The Milwaukee Bridge & Iron Company was contracted to build the superstructure of the present bridge, made of iron and with a swinging section to allow passage of vessels through the river below, as that section of the river was considered navigable to smaller commercial craft at the time. The first shipment of iron arrived in February 1879, and the bridge was completed later that year. The bridge was repaired in 1899, replacing one of the spans. River traffic declined to a trickle in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and the need to open the bridge to allow for river traffic evaporated. The manually operated swing span was last used at some point around 1920. In 1975, a new river crossing was constructed on 58th Street, only 1/2 mile from the 57th Street bridge. In 1976, the 57th Street bridge was closed due to its deterioration, but over the next few years it was rehabilitated and reconstructed, and was reopened to vehicular traffic in 1979. The bridge was again closed to vehicular traffic in 1997 for safety reasons. In 2004, the bridge was again restored, and is now used for pedestrians at the New Richmond Park to access parkland on both sides of the river. Description The New Richmond Swing Bridge has four main spans, plus eight short approach spans, totaling in length. The four main spans include an long pinned Warren pony truss swing span, two long pinned Warren pony truss spans on either side, and an additional long rivetted Warren pony truss span (repaired in 1899). On the south side, two long approach spans slope upward to meet the bridge, which sits on a concrete abutment. On the north side, six short-span steel stringer structures, each to long, approach the bridge, again on concrete abutments.

Entrance to the school is by an academic selection test. CCHS is traditionally rated among the most consistently high achieving and academically successful secondary schools in the United Kingdom, regularly scoring top marks for both GCSE and A-level results. CCHS has also been voted the best secondary school in Essex. In addition to these achievements, the school aims to instill \\"developing the leaders of tomorrow\\" in the belief that the able girls will be leaders in whichever field of work or academic study or indeed in the personal interests they choose in their future.Chelmsford County High School for Girls : A Grammar School with Academy Status History The official history of Chelmsford County High School between 1906 and 1982 is chronicled in \\"A History of Chelmsford County High School\\" by Mary Kenyon. The school was built in 1906, and officially opened in May 1907, with its first Headmistress Mabel Vernon-Harcourt. It had 76 pupils on the school roll. Miss Edith Bancroft became the second Headmistress until she retired in 1935. A new school science building, known as Bancroft Wing, was named in her honour when it was finished in 1950. Bancroft Wing subsequently became a languages building. Miss Bancroft retired as Headmistress in 1935 and was succeeded by the school's third Headmistress, Miss Geraldine Cadbury until 1961. A science block, the Cadbury Science Building, was named after her when it opened in 1995. In 1979, Miss Phyllis Pattison retired, having been headmistress since 1961, and was replaced by Miss Anne Brooks in 1980. Miss Brooks retired in 1989 and was replaced in 1990 by Bernice McCabe, who served for seven years until 1997. In 1997, Bernice McCabe left to take up the post of Headmistress in the North London Collegiate School for Girls. She was replaced by Monica Curtis, who retired in April 2006. Mrs Glynis Howland, Deputy Head, became Acting Headteacher until the appointment of Mrs Nicole Chapman, the school´s eighth Headmistress, who took over her new post in April 2007. Mrs Chapman retired in 2019, with Mr Stephen Lawlor succeeding her as Headteacher, the first male headteacher in the history of the School. In 1908 the school only had one male teacher – Art master, Alfred Bamford. In January 1910 the School Hostel opened in rented premises under the care of a Mrs Smylie to allow students with long journeys between home and school to stay in Chelmsford during the week. The school remained open throughout World War I, with forms being assigned \\"shelter\\" in a place away from windows or an outer wall. It also took in refugee students from Belgium and educated them. In June 1916 Winifred Picking became the School's first University success when she gained a First Class degree in the Natural Science Tripos at Girton College, Cambridge. The school's motto \\"Vitai lampada ferimus\\" or \\" We carry the torch of life\\" was chosen in 1923, which is part of the school crest. In 1936 the School Hostel shut down due to lack of viability, due to improved transport around Chelmsford. A year later, in 1937, the electric bell system was first installed. It was removed in 1999. The school remained open during World War II, though this time the school was damaged several times in air raids. Fortunately the worst raid, when nearly every window in the school was broken, occurred during a school holiday. Maintaining examination conditions during air raids was also a problem: eventually exam candidates were given their own separate shelter. Extensive building work was initiated in the 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s – in that time, the current caretaker's house, swimming pool, hall, canteen, art rooms, and library were built. In February 1962, HRH Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother arrived on the School grounds by helicopter to be guest of honour at the Senior Speech Day, which was held at Chelmsford Cathedral. The introduction of Technology, particularly IT, began in the 1980s. In 1992, CCHS became a Grant Maintained school with control over its own funds, and a School Bursar was employed. Margaret Thatcher, along with the local MP Simon Burns, paid a brief visit to the school on 30 March 1992. Building work continued with the development of the new school Astroturf pitch in 2004, the extension of the sixth form common room in 2005, and new music centre in 2007, which has been built in the shape of an orchestra, including a fully equipped recording studio. The building was opened in January 2008 by Dame Evelyn Glennie. In 2007 the School celebrated its Centenary, with HRH Sophie, Countess of Wessex. The school converted to academy status on 1 January 2011. In 2013 the new Languages Centre was completed, which has brought language learning into the 21st century. In 2015 and in 2020 the governors of the School voted unanimously to expand CCHS by 30 each time, increasing the intake to 180, the decision was taken in response to the ever- increasing demand for places at the School and a desire to offer the opportunity to be educated in a grammar school to even more girls. The Old Girls’ Society was formed in 1908 by the first girls to leave the School at the end of their education, and the first Magazine was published in December 1909, and both traditions have still continued, the society has been renamed to The CCHS Alumnae. In 1925 the School House system was first set up, with each House named after a Governor of the School: Chancellor, Hulton, Pennefather, and Tancock. This was changed in 1986 to three houses, C, H, and S; in 1996 a fourth house, G, was added. In September 2015, a fifth House, F, was established, and in 2020 a sixth House was added, A. The Houses are named after influential women. Achievements CCHS is noted for its high academic achievements. It is one of the most consistently highly performing schools in the country, and regularly appears in the top 10 of the Times School Supplement for GCSE, A Level and now IB results. The school also has an extremely high rate of attendance in comparison with other schools. =Specialisms= *CCHS gained Technology College status in 2000,School search Music College status (with English) in 2005 and Language College status in 2006. The school converted to an academy in 2011, but continues with the specialisms. =Awards= * CCHS held Beacon School status from 2001 to the award's discontinuation in 2005, as an example of successful practice with a view to sharing the practice with others. * An Achievement Award was awarded in all three years (1999/2000 to 2001/2002) that the scheme ran.

In 1325, there were negotiations between England and Castile for Eleanor to be betrothed to Alphonso XI of Castile, but this fell through due to the dowry. Eleanor was reunited with her mother and in 1330 negotiations were made by her mother for her and her brother John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall to marry a son and daughter of her relative Philip VI of France, however they fell through also. =Duchess of Guelders= In May 1332 Eleanor married the reigning Count of Guelders, Reinoud II \\"the black\\" (English: Reginald), of the House of Wassenberg (born c. 1287), a marriage arranged by her mother's cousin Joan of Valois. The groom, quite dark of colour and character, was a widower with four daughters. He was known for having imprisoned his father for over six years. As Eleanor sailed from Sandwich, her wedding trousseau included a wedding gown of Spanish cloth, caps, gloves, shoes, a bed, rare spices and loaves of sugar. She was well received in Guelders. Due to her unhappy childhood, Eleanor grew nervous and over-eager to please her husband, who tired of her. She was sent from court in 1336 under the pretext that she had leprosy.

It serves roughly 1200 students from the eastern side of Pictou County. It is administratively part of the \\"Celtic Region\\" of the Chignecto- Central Regional School Board. The school's official colours are blue and white. It teaches a broad variety of materials, from traditional academics, to the Fine Arts, to Co-Op courses. The school is also active in sports and extracurricular activities. In addition, NNEC is one of schools involved in Nova Scotia International Student Program. They host international students from China, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Brazil, South Korea, etc. They provide multi-courses even special help for foreign students to adopt local education and Canadian lifestyles. Each school year, there are two student ambassadors here to help international students and organize events to provide them memories of Nova Scotia. This school also offers a program called CEP (Career Exploration Program). This better prepares students who are planning on going straight into the work force rather than going to university. History North Nova Education Centre officially opened on November 24, 2003. The school's colours are light blue, navy blue and white, with the mascot being the Gryphon. The gryphon was comprised to represent the mascots of the four schools which amalgamated to form North Nova Education Centre. The Gryphon has the Sword of the Trojan (Trenton High School), the body of the Panther (New Glasgow High School) and the wings and the head of a Blue Eagle (East Pictou Rural High School). Students from Thorburn Consolidated School attend NNEC as well, but since they were not a high school in 2003, none of the school's mascots were added to the gryphon. However some say that the wings on the gryphon are from the Thorburn Consolidated School mascot of the Skyhawk. The school is built in a ring design, around a large central courtyard.

September 26, 2014. Although flocks of wild turkeys are more common in the city's greener parts (including the Bronx's Pelham Bay Park and Van Cortlandt Park and Staten Island's South Beach Psychiatric Hospital) due to the ban on hunting, Zelda was believed to be the only one in Manhattan. Previous Manhattan turkeys included Giuliani (at Riverside Park; this turkey may have actually been Zelda due to her appearance coinciding with Zelda's migration) and Hedda Gobbler (at Morningside Park). Life and death Zelda was named after Zelda Fitzgerald, because (according to legend) during one of Zelda Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. It is presumed that she entered Manhattan's north end from the Bronx in 2002 as a wild turkey fitting her description was first spotted in Riverside Park and then near the American Museum of Natural History and Tavern on the Green. She continued to make her way downtown before finally settling in Battery Park. She occasionally wandered from the park, possibly in search of a mate. Each summer she left the park to nest and lay unfertilized eggs. In 2004 she was seen in Tribeca before being captured and returned to Battery Park. In 2007 a turkey, presumably Zelda, was spotted in Greenwich Village and Tribeca. She spent the summer of 2013 in nearby Battery Park City. In 2006 and again in 2009, she garnered wider attention when some tourists began to fear for her safety around Thanksgiving. In 2012, she again drew attention when it was realized that she survived Hurricane Sandy after having been missing for five days. While most wild turkeys only live to be six years old, Zelda was at least ten. On October 9, 2014, it was announced that Zelda had been found dead during the previous week, following an automobile collision. Giuliani Giuliani is the name given to a female wild turkey spotted in Riverside Park, who may have actually have been Zelda. A wild turkey was spotted in Riverside Park (adjacent to the North/Hudson River) as early as 2003, and wild turkeys have been reported there since. New Yorkers who frequent the park have taken to calling the turkeys they see there Giuliani, after Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City.

Biography Born in Hicksville, Ohio, Daeida was the daughter of farmers Amelia and John Emerson Hartell, and attended private school in Hicksville and later public school in Canton, Ohio. She married prohibitionist Harvey Henderson Wilcox, and they moved to Kansas. In 1886 they moved to Southern California and in 1887 purchased a ranch of apricot and fig groves, outside of Los Angeles at the foot of the Hollywood Hills. A few months after they acquired their new ranch, Daeida visited family and friends in her hometown of Hicksville. Daeida learned of the name Hollywood from Ivar Weid, her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now Lake Hollywood) and a prominent L.A. investor. In August of 1887 at the age of 25, she and her husband began to lay out a new town on their ranch, with a subdivision map filed for \\"Hollywood, California,\\" with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. Their ranch, purchased at $150 an acre, was sold for $1,000 a lot. The 1880s real-estate boom busted that same year, yet Hollywood began its slow growth. Harvey Wilcox died in 1891. In 1894, Daeida married Philo J. Beveridge, a businessman and prominent citizen of Hollywood and son of an Illinois governor, who shared her vision of community. The Beveridges had four children Hicksville Historical Society—Daeida Beveridge With her second husband, Daeida continued leading development efforts and was instrumental in establishing much of Hollywood's civic infrastructure, including the city hall, library, police station, primary school, tennis club, post office, city park, and one of the two original commercial districts. She built the Hollywood National Bank and Citizen's Savings Bank, a post office, a theatrical playhouse, and the city's first sidewalks. For cultural enhancement, she also donated land for three churches, and her own residence's 3 prime lots on Cahuenga Boulevard and Prospect (Hollywood Boulevard) to the painter Paul de Longpré, for an estate including extensive flower gardens, and a Mission Revival style mansion with a public art gallery. It became one of the most popular tourist attractions. She came to be called the \\"Mother of Hollywood.\\" Daeida Wilcox Beveridge died on 7 August 1914. The Los Angeles Times obituary stated that it was Daeida's dream of beauty that gave world fame to Hollywood, years before the first movie company arrived in 1913.

Pagani has a population of 35,834, as of 2016. History In the period before the Roman supremacy in southern Italy, Taurania appears to have been the chief town in the valley of the Sarnus, Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae and Surrentum all being dependent upon it. It maintained its allegiance to Rome till 309 BC when it joined the revolted Samnites. In 308 BC it repulsed a Roman attempt to land at the mouth of the Sarnus, but in 307 BC it was besieged and surrendered. Under Romans it was named Barbatianus. It obtained favourable terms, and remained faithful to Rome even after Cannae. Hannibal reduced it in 216 BC by starvation, and destroyed the town. The inhabitants returned when peace was restored. Even during the Social War it remained true to Rome. In 73 BC it was plundered by Spartacus. In the Middle Ages (around the 9th century) a small colony of Saracens was actually introduced in the town by permission of the Dukes of Naples, but it lasted only a few decades. It was united to Nocera Inferiore, and it took the name of Nuceria Paganorum, by the Pagans, a noble family living in the castle of Curtis in Plano (the family could have taken this surname from the pagans/Saracens who previously inhabited the area), in the nowadays Pagani. Churches and religion Pagani is home to some well-known churches and basilica, including: *The Shrine of Saint Mary the Crowned of Mount Carmel (), commonly known as the Shrine of Our Lady of the Hens (). This Marian shrine hosts the annual Feast of Our Lady of the Hens (). During this week, people dance in the streets to the tammurriata (or tarantella).

Simpson (2004). was a Scottish soldier and adventurer who earned a substantial sum of money through gambling and the South Sea Bubble. He was convicted of raping a servant in 1730 and sentenced to death, but was subsequently pardoned, before dying of natural causes shortly afterwards. Early life Charteris was born at Edinburgh in about 1675, the son of John Charteris (died 1691 [?] dead by 1702), a magistrate, and his wife, Mary, who was possibly the daughter of Sir Francis Kinloch, 1st Baronet. His family were land-holders and owned property in Amisfield, near Dumfries.Page Life, \\"Charteris, Francis (c.1665–1732)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., Jan 2008 . Even before his conviction, he was notorious and despised by many in London as an archetypal rake. He had a serial military career, being dismissed from service four times; the third time in the Southern Netherlands by the Duke of Marlborough, for cheating at cards, and the fourth time by Parliament for accepting bribes. Despite his military dismissals, he amassed a considerable fortune. Personal life Charteris married Helen Swinton, the daughter of Alexander Swinton, Lord Mersington; their daughter Janet married James Wemyss, 5th Earl of Wemyss, in 1720, and his grandson, Francis Wemyss Charteris, 7th Earl of Wemyss, adopted his mother's maiden name in 1732 when he inherited his grandfather's estates. Charteris' mistress, prostitute Sally Salisbury Rape of Anne Bond Charteris would send his servants out through the countryside to recruit women for him to have sex with. The methods and enticements he used made him disliked by the poor in some parts of England. His reputation preceded his trial for raping a servant named Anne Bond. When Bond was hired, on 24 October 1729, she was informed that her employer was \\"Colonel Harvey\\" for fear that his reputation would put off his prospective employee. Charteris had a number of contacts who regularly hired women to work as servants, who would then be trapped in the house and repeatedly \\"urged\\" to have sex with him. When Bond began to work, she was immediately besieged by \\"Harvey's\\" advances, along with offers of money; but she refused. On her third day of employment, Anne realised that Harvey was in fact Colonel Francis Charteris and requested to leave. This request was refused, and staff were positioned to prevent her from escaping.Cruikshank, Dan (2009); The Secret History of Georgian London: How the Wages of Sin Shaped the Capital; Colonel Francis Charteris pp 311-320; Windmill Books (2010). The next morning, 10 November, Charteris attacked and raped Bond. There were no witnesses, and Charteris' servants in the next room later testified that they heard nothing. When Bond told Charteris she was going to the authorities over the crime, he ordered servants to whip her and take her belongings and throw her out the door, telling them that she had stolen money from him. With assistance from Mary Parsons, perhaps a former employer, Bond brought a complaint for the misdemeanour of \\"assault with intent to commit rape.\\" The Middlesex grand jury originally found grounds to proceed with this charge but later upgraded the charge to the capital felony of rape. On 27 February 1730, Charteris was tried for rape at the Old Bailey. The trial was a media sensation. The defence attacked the virtue and motives of the complainant, accusing her of compliance, prostitution, theft, and extortion. Many of Charteris' witnesses and documents were shown to be false, and the jury quickly found him guilty. On 2 March, he was sentenced to death and held in Newgate Prison. The Earl of Egmont wrote in his diary 'All the world agree he deserved to be hanged long ago, but they differ whether on this occasion;' while Fog's Weekly Journal of 14 March 1730 reported 'We hear no Rapes have been committed for three Weeks past. Colonel Francis Charteris is still in Newgate.' On 10 April 1730, George II granted him a royal pardon after a campaign that included the Scottish Lord Advocate Duncan Forbes, who rented a house from Charteris in Edinburgh, and Anne Bond herself, possibly prompted by the promise of an annuity. As a convicted felon, his property should have been forfeit under the doctrine of attainder, but he petitioned the King for its return. In composition (fine) for his offence, he paid substantial sums to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex. He was also suspected of having given substantial gifts to various important individuals. Jonathan Swift commented on Charteris in several poems. In Lines on the Death of Dr. Swift (1731), he explains \\"Chartres\\" as, \\"a most infamous, vile scoundrel, grown from a foot-boy, or worse, to a prodigious fortune both in England and Scotland: he had a way of insinuating himself into all Ministers under every change, either as pimp, flatterer, or informer. He was tried at seventy for a rape, and came off by sacrificing a great part of his fortune\\" (note to l. 189). Death In 1732, he died from natural causes in Edinburgh, possibly from a condition caused by his stay in Newgate Prison. Shortly before he died, he was said to have stated that he would pay £150,000 to anybody who could prove to him that there was no hell. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard; his coffin was attacked on its way to the graveyard, and it is said that dead cats were thrown into his grave. Upon his death, John Arbuthnot published \\"Epitaph on Don Francisco\\" in The London Magazine (April 1732). In it, he wrote that Charteris was a man, :...who, having done, every Day of his Life, ::Something worthy of a Gibbet, :::Was once condemned to one :::For what he had not done. In literature William Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress, plate 1, showing Molly's arrival in London, with Colonel Francis Charteris and \\"Handy Jack\\" leering in the background, while a syphilitic madame Elizabeth Needham in the foreground procures her first Charteris was the inspiration for characters in William Hogarth's paintings, A Rake's Progress and A Harlot's Progress (where he is represented as the fat lecher in the first plate), and in Fanny Hill. He was condemned by Alexander Pope in his Moral Essay III, written in 1733. Parallels were drawn between Charteris' sexual excesses and the greed of politicians such as Robert Walpole.

It is, like suburbanization, inversely related to urbanization. It first occurred as a reaction to inner-city deprivation. More recent research has documented the social and political drivers of counterurbanization and its impacts in developing countries such as China, which are currently undergoing the process of mass urbanization. It is one of the causes that can lead to shrinking cities. While counterurbanization manifests differently across the world, all forms revolve around the central idea of migration movement from a populated location to a less populated location. Clare J.A. Mitchell, an associate professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Waterloo, argues that in Europe, counterurbanization involves a type of migration leading to deconcentration of one area to another that is beyond suburbanization or metro decentralization. Mitchell categorizes counterurbanization into three sub- types: ex-urbanization, displaced-urbanization, and anti-urbanization.  Causes  Counter urbanization is the process by which people migrate from urban to rural communities, the opposite of urbanization. People have moved from urban to rural communities for various reasons, including job opportunities and simpler lifestyles. In recent years, due to technology, this process has been occurring in reverse. With new communications technology, people from rural communities can work from home because they can connect with each other via rural Internet, which means some employment opportunities no longer require moving to an urban community.Science Daily Counter urbanization is about people being able to explore alternatives to living in the city, creating changes in living location preferences. In past years, a multi- corporation business would use outsourcing by hiring workers in poorer countries for cheap labor. In more recent years, corporations have been using \\"rural sourcing\\" which involves using small to medium sized town as a source of labor. This creates jobs in the country and also for rural communities so they do not need to move their entire family to a whole new setting and also reduces unnecessary expense for the companies. Most of the workers in these rural settings get paid less but have an option of either working from home or an office. If they were in an urban setting, the company would spend more money on an entirely new office for the urban-based employees to work at. In the past, the general migration trend in the United States has been from the east to the west. Art Hall, an executive director of the Centre for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas School of Business states \\"California has been losing people for at least a decade ... two patterns of migration are under way in California. People are leaving the coast and moving to the Northern interior. When they leave, they tend to go to places like Arizona and Nevada. So it's not a far move. And they also are going up north to Seattle and Portland. Part of the answer there is that it's just very expensive to live on the California coast.\\" According to Hall, people have been influenced to move because of factors like climate, jobs, and tax rates. Hall also found that people who are not a part of a more stable family will tend to move more. People choosing to live in rural areas have found it more beneficial because of cleaner air, peace and quiet, and plentiful space. Smaller towns have also been proven to be convenient for the inhabitants. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data published in a 2009 study shows that people are moving from big cities with populations over 4 million to much smaller cities with around 1-2 million people. The reasons that people are leaving cities for smaller cities is not the same across the globe. For Russia, jobs have not always moved to rural areas to accommodate those who want to leave the city. Rather, people find themselves having two homes, one in the city during work days and one in rural areas for days off. There is a weak infrastructure outside of cities to accommodate people who wish to completely relocate. In 2010, it was found that two-thirds of small towns are depressed, meaning that it has a large working- age population that is unemployed, and businesses are not profitable. Clare J.A. Mitchell believes the phenomenon of counterurbanization to be reflective of values and ideology in people’s preferred living style thus taking into consideration not only distances traveled from the urban area but the motivations. Mitchell uses the term “ex-urbanization” that is used in reference to the phenomenon that people reside in the outside perimeters of an urban city but remain closely involved through their social networks and jobs, and the term \\"ex-urbanites\\" in reference to those people. Ex-urbanites typically still enjoy the benefits of modern infrastructure. Another term concerning differing motives for traveling or moving away from the city is people who are forced out of the city due to factors such as: the inability to find work, the increased cost of living, or dissatisfaction and/or conflicts with the culture of urban society. This phenomenon is “displaced- urbanization”. Finally, there are those who participate in “anti- urbanization”. Typically these people are motivated by a sort of rejection concerning the urban lifestyle and consumer culture. Anti-urbanization is an escape for those to choose to leave and forgo the lifestyle and culture of the city. The decisive decision to move away from the city for this type of counter urbanization is usually a step toward spiritual growth and rejection of materialism. Political factors may also lead to anti-urbanization. During the \\"Cultural Revolution\\" in 1966-1976, urbanization in China stagnated, and a nation-wide anti-urbanization phenomenon occurred, which was specifically manifested in a large-scale \\"Down to the Countryside Movement\\". Intellectuals were persecuted and removed to rural areas. It is estimated that during the peak period of Down to the Countryside Movement at the end of the 1960s, more than 10 million people moved from urban China to rural areas, while the total urban population in China was only 168 million in 1968. This anti-urbanization event was fundamentally different from the counter-urbanization in developed countries, as it resulted from a far-left communist ideology.

The MDU was established in 1885 and was the first of its kind in the world. It has over 200,000 members who are doctors, dental professionals (through its sister company the Dental Defence Union (DDU)), medical students or other healthcare professionals; the MDU provides legal support should their clinical competence be questioned. The MDU is a not for profit mutual organisation and one of three major MDOs in the UK. History The Medical Defence Union was founded in 1885 following outrage in the medical community over the case of a Dr David Bradley who was wrongly convicted of a charge of assaulting a woman in his surgery. Dr Bradley spent eight months in prison before receiving a full pardon. By late 1885, there was increasing recognition among the medical profession of the real risk doctors ran in their everyday practice and the poor resources at their disposal to defend themselves. The British Medical Association, for example, to which many of the profession belonged, was not permitted under its constitution to undertake individual medical defence. In 1885, solicitors Mr Dauney and Mr Cridland, together with Mr Rideal, Mr Clements, Mr Leggatt, Mr Sinyanki and Mr Fitzgerald, signed a memorandum that established the aims and objectives of the newly registered company, the Medical Defence Union. They were the first executive board. The annual subscription cost for members was set at 10 shillings. Services The services provided by the MDU to members are set out in its member guide which include: * Professional indemnity against claims for clinical negligence * Support and representation with disciplinary and regulatory investigations, coroner’s inquests and criminal investigations into members’ professional practice * Medico-legal advice including out of hours emergency helpline 24 hours a day * Help with responding to patient complaints * Support when faced with media attention such as help with preparing media statements and responding to the media * Risk management resources from case reports and online journals * CPD-accredited education courses helping members reduce the risk of a complaint or claim, and improve their wellbeing and communication skills * Free access to member app containing latest news, membership card and proof of membership * Member discounts on books, courses, online revision resources Journals The MDU produces three journals for members which are available on its website and in its member app – the MDU journal, the DDU journal and Student Notes. Lobbying The MDU is active in influencing the medico-legal climate on behalf of members. In 2012 the MDU launched its campaign calling on the government to make compensation for injured patients fair and affordable. The campaign was launched in response to spiralling medical negligence bills which have quadrupled in the last decade. According to chief executive, Dr Christine Tomkins, compensation claims in England are among the highest in the world and the consequence of this on general practice and the wider NHS is catastrophic. MDU also campaigned for state-backed indemnity for GPs in England which was introduced in April 2019 and they have called for healthcare professionals to be exempt from litigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulatory and legal information The Medical Defence Union is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority for insurance mediation and consumer credit activities only. The MDU is not an insurance company. The benefits of MDU membership are all discretionary and are subject to the Memorandum and Articles of Association.

The novel won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize at the Hay literary festival, the Waverton Good Read Award 2005/6, and was short-listed for the 2005 Orange Prize for Fiction, losing to Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin. Over a million copies have been sold in the UK. The book was originally published in English, and has been translated into Russian and Ukrainian. In a BBC Bookclub interview, the author mentioned that some reviewers of the Ukrainian translation were hostile, seeing it as an attack on their country.  Plot  The novel describes the reactions of two daughters when their widowed, 84-year-old father Nikolai marries a highly sexual and much younger Ukrainian immigrant, Valentina. Concerned about Valentina’s motives, Nadezhda and Vera are drawn back into contact with each other after a long period of estrangement. They find themselves united against a common enemy in Valentina, whose grasping, manipulative behavior escalates until the daughters finally succeed in obtaining a divorce for their father. Nikolai, a former engineer who emigrated to Britain in the aftermath of the Second World War, is writing a history of tractors in Ukrainian, translated extracts from which appear throughout the text. In the process of sorting out Nikolai’s marital entanglements, Nadezhda also uncovers secrets from her family’s history and learns about their experiences during the Ukrainian famine and Stalin’s purges. The action takes place in Peterborough, England, and is narrated by the youngest daughter, Nadezhda, a university lecturer in Sociology.  Reception  The Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov, reviewing the book in The Guardian, calls the book a \\"banal tale\\" that will not teach the reader anything about \\"the Ukrainian community in Britain\\". He states that the \\"rhythm and dynamics of this debut novel are well managed\\", and that Lewycka is successful in setting up \\"many comic situations\\", but finds the characters, such as Valentina with her \\"enormous breasts\\" and liking for green satin underwear, \\"caricatures\\" and the novel \\"constructed\\". The Polish translator and travel writer Magda Healey, reviewing the book for Bookbag, thought it \\"eminently readable, well flowing and colourful\\", though it showed a common fault of autobiographical debut novels, with too much content crammed in, the stories often not thoroughly explored. All the same, it had moving moments, some poetically beautiful passages, and \\"wonderfully absurd\\" scenes of farce. She found the sections of the engineer Nikolai's monumental history of tractors \\"a nice device\\". It was undemanding \\"but not totally shallow\\".

She is Chancellor of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. She was a judge on BBC Two's Great British Menu for eleven years, before joining The Great British Bake Off in March 2017, replacing Mary Berry, when the series moved to Channel 4. Early life Leith was born in Cape Town, South Africa. Her father, Sam Leith, worked for African Explosives, a subsidiary of ICI producing dynamite for use in mines and ultimately served as a director. Her mother, Margaret 'Peggy' Inglis, was an actress of her time. From the age of 5 until she was 17, Leith attended St Mary's School, Waverley, an English independent private boarding school for girls in Johannesburg run by Anglican nuns. She left with a first class matriculation and studied at the University of Cape Town, where she failed to follow for any length of time courses in drama, fine art, architecture or French. She persuaded her parents to allow her to attend the Sorbonne (formally, the University of Paris), ostensibly to better learn French while studying the Cours de Civilisation Française. While in Paris, she finally realised she wanted a career in the premium food industry. Career In 1960, Leith moved to London to attend the Cordon Bleu Cookery School and then began a business supplying high-quality business lunches. This grew to become Leith's Good Food, a party and event caterer. In 1969, she opened Leith's, her Michelin-starred restaurant in Notting Hill, eventually selling it in 1995. In 1975, she founded Leith's School of Food and Wine, which trains professional chefs and amateur cooks. The group reached a turnover of £15m in 1993, which she then sold. In 1995, she helped found the Prue Leith College (since renamed Prue Leith Chef's Academy) in South Africa. The first woman appointed to the British Railways Board in 1977, she set about improving its much-criticised catering. The catering division, called Travellers Fare, was detached from the hotels business in 1982, and innovative outlets were created, including Casey Jones, and Upper Crust. ≤ref≥cite Terry Gourvish, British Rail 1974-97 (Oxford, 2002), p.251.≤≥ Concurrently with running her business, Leith became a food columnist for, successively, the Daily Mail, Sunday Express, The Guardian and the Daily Mirror. Aside from writing 12 cookery books, including Leith's Cookery Bible (with the Leith's School of Food and Wine Principal, Caroline Waldegrave), she has written seven novels: Leaving Patrick, Sisters, A Lovesome Thing, Choral Society, A Serving of Scandal, The Food of Love: Laura's Story and The Prodigal Daughter. These last two form part of the Food of Love trilogy. The trilogy has been optioned for a TV series by Sprout Pictures in partnership with Parallel Films. Her memoir, Relish, was published in 2012. Her first television appearance was in the 1970s as a presenter of two thirteen-episode magazine series aimed at women at home, made by Tyne Tees Television. She was a last-minute replacement for Jack de Manio, and with no experience and a director who liked everything scripted, including interviews, she disliked the experience. Later, in the 1980s, she was the subject of two television programmes about her life and career: the first episode of Channel Four's Take Six Cooks and the BBC's The Best of British, a series about young entrepreneurs. In 1999, she was one of the Commissioners on Channel 4's Poverty Commission. She came back to television to be a judge on The Great British Menu (BBC Two) for eleven years until 2016, and a judge for My Kitchen Rules (Channel 4), which she left to replace Mary Berry in The Great British Bake Off on Channel Four. She has been involved in food in education. When chair of the Royal Society of Arts she founded and chaired the charity Focus on Food (now part of the Soil Association) which promotes cooking in the curriculum. She also started, with the charity Training for Life, the Hoxton Apprentice – a not-for-profit restaurant which for ten years trained the most disadvantaged long-term unemployed young people. Until 2015, she was a member of the Food Strand of the grant giving foundation, Esmée Fairbairne. From 2007–10, she was the Chair of the School Food Trust, the government quango largely responsible for the improvement in school food after Jamie Oliver’s television exposé of the poor state of school food. The Trust (now the Children's Food Trust) also set up and runs Let's Get Cooking, an organisation of over 5000 cooking clubs in state schools, of which she is a patron. She is Vice-President of The Sustainable Restaurant Association, a trustee of Baby Taste Journey (an education charity concerned with healthy food for infants); Patron of The Institute for Food, Brain and Behaviour, Sustain’s Hospital Food Campaign, and the Prue Leith Chef's Academy in her native South Africa. She has also been active in general education, chairing Ashridge Management College (2002–07); 3E's Enterprises (an education company successfully turning round failing schools and managing academies (1998–2006) and Chairman of Governors at the secondary school Kings College in Guildford (2000–7). She has also been involved in many diverse organisations: she chaired the Restaurateurs Association (1990–94); she was a member of the Investors in People working group; she chaired the RSA (Royal Society of Arts) (1995–97); and Forum for the Future (2000–3). She was a director of the housing association, Places for People (1999–2003) and a member of the Consumer Debt Working Group that contributed to the Conservative Party's 2006 policy document Breakdown Britain (2004–5). She has also been one of the voices in favour of Brexit, defending her choice, although lately voicing concern over lowering of food standards . While at the RSA she led the successful campaign to use the empty plinth (now known as the Fourth Plinth) in Trafalgar Square to house changing sculptures or installations by the best contemporary artists. Leith has been a non-executive director of British Rail; British Transport Hotels; Safeway; Argyll plc, the Leeds Permanent Building Society; Whitbread plc; Woolworths plc; the Halifax; Triven VCT; Omega International plc; and Belmond Hotels Ltd (formerly Orient Express Hotels) and is a director and investor in several start-up companies. In July 2017, she was installed as the Chancellor of Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. Personal life Leith was married to author Rayne Kruger from 1974 until his death aged 80 in December 2002. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. Their daughter, Li-Da Kruger (a Cambodian adoptee), is a filmmaker. Their son, Danny Kruger, left his job as a speechwriter and advisor to David Cameron to establish jointly with his wife Emma the Only Connect charity, which works with prisoners and ex-offenders. He has been the Conservative MP for Devizes since December 2019. In May 2020 she expressed support of the breach of virus lockdown by Dominic Cummings and Mary Wakefield, whom her son described as \\"old friends\\". In October 2016, Leith married John Playfair, a retired clothes designer. Her brother, ex-restaurateur James Leith, is married to the biographer Penny Junor. Honours Leith's honours include the Business Woman of the Year in 1990, and thirteen honorary degrees or fellowships from UK universities.

The competition offered a series of prizes for teams that launch a vertical takeoff/vertical landing (VTVL) rocket that achieved the total delta-v needed for a vehicle to move between the surface of the Moon and its orbit. The multi-level competition was conducted by the X PRIZE Foundation, with sponsorship from the Northrop Grumman Corporation who ran the ongoing competition. The prize purses were paid by NASA. It was held annually at the X PRIZE Cup, making its debut at the 2006 Wirefly X PRIZE Cup in October, 2006, until 2009 when the prize purse was awarded to Masten Space Systems and Armadillo Aerospace. Competition rules The competition is divided into two levels. Both levels require teams to demonstrate control of their vehicle by flying to an altitude of more than , flying laterally for , and landing on a pad. For level 1, this pad is a simple diameter circle; for level 2, it is a simulated lunar surface, complete with craters and boulders. After completing this first flight, the vehicle can then be refueled, and must then fly a second leg back to the original starting point. Each flight must meet a required minimum flight time of 90 seconds for level 1 and 180 seconds for level 2\\\\. For each level, the two flights along with any necessary preparation must be accomplished within a short 150-minute time period.\\\\- Northrop GrummanLunar Lander Challenge Each Level offered a first- and second-place prize. Level 1 awarded a first place prize purse of $350,000 and a $150,000 purse for second place. The more difficult level 2 awarded first place prize of $1 million and a $500,000 second place prize. 2006 2006 was the first year of the competition. It was announced on May 5, 2006, giving teams only a few months to prepare for the late-October competition. Although four teams officially registered for the competition, only one was able to receive the required permit from the FAA before the event. Armadillo Aerospace arrived at the 2006 event, held at Las Cruces International Airport in New Mexico, with two matching vehicles, named Pixel and Texel. In the end, Armadillo made three attempts to win the prize, each one using Pixel. In all three cases, difficult landings left them short of the mission requirementson two occasions, rough landings caused damage to the vehicle; on a third, the vehicle failed to land completely on the target pad. Team Armadillo left without any prize money, but still had made history by performing the first successful flight of a private vehicle of this class as well as the first flight under the FAA's new Experimental Permit. 2007 The 2007 Lunar Lander Challenge took place on October 27-28 at the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Micro-Space, one of the teams registered in 2007, had to retreat from the competition after they missed a mandatory meeting. The only team to compete was again Armadillo Aerospace. Armadillo entered their MOD vehicle for level 1\\\\. They attempted six flights, but never completed the full profile. A flight on October 27 ended with the vehicle crashing on the return flight. Their final flight attempt on October 28 caused a fire on the launch pad. Team leader John Carmack expressed his disappointment, saying \\"today is officially a bad day when it comes to our vehicle.\\" 2008 The 2008 Lunar Lander Challenge took place October 24-25, back at the Las Cruces International Airport. Two teams competed. Because the X PRIZE Cup was canceled for 2008, the Lunar Lander Challenge was held separately, and was open only to members of the press. It was, however, broadcast live by the official event webcast, SpaceVidcast. The only teams that flew were Armadillo Aerospace and TrueZer0. Both received waivers from the FAA to fly experimental rockets. TrueZer0 attempted level 1, achieved hover, then lost roll control and was aborted and crashed. Armadillo had an unsuccessful first attempt at level 1, and landed early due to inadequate thrust. On their second attempt they completed the first leg, but the second leg was cut short by the FAA closing the flight window. The second leg was held in the afternoon, and they were able to take the Level 1 top prize of $350,000. Armadillo made an attempt at the level 2 prize on October 25, but had a fuel valve failure, burned through the engine nozzle, and rolled the vehicle at takeoff. They decided not to make another attempt. 2009 Armadillo Aerospace technicians on the launch pad performing a vehicle inspection. The method of competing in Lunar Lander Challenge was modified for the 2009 competition season to enable teams to compete from different locations, rather than at a single location, as was done in previous seasons. Instead, judges travelled to a location near the applicants' home base. Prize competition attempts were attempted over the course of several days during the LLC season of July 20 to October 31. The Lunar Lander Challenge concluded this season with the following flights and results: * Armadillo Aerospace made their attempt for the Level 2 purse from Caddo Mills, Texas, on September 12 and 13, and successfully qualified for the Level 2 prize. The judges would later rule the accuracy of this flight as 2nd place for Level 2. * Masten Space Systems attempted to win second prize for Level 1 on September 15–16, but aborted after first flight. They successfully flew both legs (Level 1) on October 7 from the Mojave Air & Space Port.

His work included private houses as well as public buildings. T. Phillips Figgis was the second son of Thomas Gilbert Figgis from Dublin, Ireland, and his wife Margaret Phillips. Some of his best-known works are the original station buildings for the City & South London Railway (C&SLR;, now part of London Underground's Northern line) which opened in 1890. Figgis designed the stations at Stockwell, Oval, Kennington, Elephant and Castle and Borough. When the C&SLR; was extended, he later designed a station at Clapham North and the station and C&SLR;'s offices at Moorgate. Most of Figgis's buildings for the C&SLR; have been replaced or substantially altered; only Kennington (with minor alterations) and Moorgate remain. Other railway buildings he designed included the four new stations on the Meon Valley Railway.

The Rudd Center moved from Yale to the University of Connecticut in December 2014. Economics An example of an economic policy that The Rudd Center is using to attempt to change the economy is the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax. The center focuses on the economic conditions underlying why certain demographics, primarily those that are less wealthy living in poorer areas, are subject to such higher rates of obesity. Another area of focus is the externalities that may have caused obesity at large. The Center advocates policy to curb obesity by supporting legislation to regulate food labels and what children have access to in school zones. Public policy and government The Rudd Center seeks to actively engage policy and lawmakers to influence outcomes on food policy, school and community nutrition, and anti-obesity campaigns. It maintains a legislative database through which researchers can search proposed legislation that affects current food policy and legislation filed in Congress. Schools, families and communities The Rudd Center actively participates in the growing concern of the nations childhood obesity problem by conducting research that impacts school food programs such as the school breakfast program, the national lunch program, the summer food service program, and the fresh fruit and vegetable programs. Weight bias and stigma Although public awareness of increasing biases against obesity has been raised, there is very little that has been to counteract the bias that children and adult face on a daily basis. This involves areas that range from discrimination in employment and media stereotypes, to stigma faced in interpersonal relationships. The Rudd Center aims to stop the stigma at all age groups through research, education, and advocacy.

Byrd Bridge is a continuous truss bridge that crosses the Ohio River between Huntington, West Virginia and Chesapeake, Ohio. The crossing was constructed to replace an old, narrow, two-lane structure that was demolished after 69 years of service in a spectacular implosion on July 17, 1995. The previous bridge, opened in 1926, was Huntington's first bridge across the Ohio River and was designed in a gothic style, complete with four two-ton spires that rested on top of each peak. The groundbreaking ceremony for the four-lane bridge was held on April 30, 1991. James Watkins, of the Ohio Department of Transportation, stated that the importance of the new four-lane span would only be heightened by the construction of the Chesapeake-Proctorville State Route 7 bypass that would \\"begin in 1996.\\"Bridge opening sparks memories.\\" The Ironton Tribune. 6 Nov. 1994.\\" Work on the bypass did not begin until 2000. The old 6th Street Bridge closed in the summer of 1993 to allow for the construction of the ramps and approaches in West Virginia and Ohio. The new bridge was named the Robert C. Byrd Bridge under an executive order from former Governor Gaston Caperton to honor the U.S. senator from West Virginia, who is credited with obtaining the funding for the project that was completed on November 6, 1994. The $32.6 million bridge was constructed with $1.4 coming from Ohio, $5.6 coming from West Virginia, and $25.3 in federal funds. The famous spires which once adorned the top of the former span were saved. One is currently on display outside of the Chesapeake city hall at the intersection of State Route 7 and the Robert C.

Biography Moggi was born in Monticiano, in the province of Siena. He worked as a railway station caretaker until the early 1970s, when he met Italo Allodi, then Juventus' managing director, who appointed him to minor roles at the club. Before being called as chief managing director by Juventus in 1994, he worked for and collaborated with several teams, such as Torino, Napoli, Roma and Lazio. He has a son Alessandro, who works as an agent for several football players and managers. He is head of GEA World, a consortium of football agents and managers, which the company and Alessandro were ranked the first by volume from 2002 to 2006. In 2006, he was the main figure involved in a football scandal, after the publication of several wiretappings in which he suggested and asked for particular referees' names to Pierluigi Pairetto, the former Italian referee nominator. Moggi received a life ban from football and a recommendation to the FIGC president that he be banned for life from membership of the FIGC at any level. As early as 2010, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their scudetto from 2005 and the non-assignment of the 2006 title, dependent on the results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal. On 8 November 2011, Naples court issued the first conclusion of the criminal case against Luciano Moggi and the other football personalities involved, sentencing him to jail for five years and four months for \\"criminal association.\\" In December 2013, Moggi's sentence was reduced to two years and four months for being found guilty of conspiring to commit a crime, but the earlier charge of sporting fraud passed the statute of limitations. On 23 March 2015, in its final resolution the Supreme Court ruled that Moggi was acquitted of \\"some individual charges for sporting fraud, but not from being the 'promoter' of the 'criminal conspiracy' that culminated in Calciopoli\\". Nevertheless, the remaining charges of Moggi were cancelled without a new trial due to the statute of limitations. The then club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost scudetti in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit. On 9 September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case: despite that Moggi's remaining charges were cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits. Eventually, in 2016 the TAR tribunal rejected the request of compensation promoted by Juventus. On 15 March 2017, Moggi's lifetime ban was definitively confirmed on final appeal. He continues to make observations on the Serie A on the newspaper Libero and the local television channel Telecapri Sport. Since 2011 collaborates with Radio Manà Manà. =Personal views= Moggi has spoken out against gay footballers, saying that: \\"A homosexual can't fulfil the job of a footballer.

Etymology and origins Half-tone engraving of Yogi Ghamande in Dhanurasana in his Yogasopana Purvacatuska, 1905. The text below the image cites the Gheranda Samhita, whose description of the pose is ambiguous. The name comes from the Sanskrit words धनुर (dhanur) meaning \\"bow\\", and आसन (āsana) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". A similar pose named Nyubjasana, \\"the face-down asana\\", is described and illustrated in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi. The pose is illustrated in half-tone in the 1905 Yogasopana Purvacatuska and named Dhanurāsana, quoting the Gheranda Samhita's description. It is unclear whether the asana is medieval, as although the name is used, the intended pose might be the sitting Akarna Dhanurasana rather than this backbend. The account of Dhanurasana in the 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika is ambiguous about whether the pose is reclining or sitting, stating The 17th century Gheranda Samhita is similarly ambiguous, stating Dhanurasana is used in the classical Indian dance form Bharatanatyam.

Also known as the City of Children, the community is featured as a 1949 episode of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer's short film series Passing Parade, which was written and narrated by John Nesbitt. In 2013 Mooseheart celebrated its 100th anniversary with a rededication ceremony, public tours, fireworks, and other festivities. Like the Moose Lodge, Mooseheart was originally only open to Caucasians. The facility was created to be a home for the widows and the children of members of the Loyal Order of Moose. Later, any child who had a family member who was a member of the moose could be admitted. In 1994, admission policies were changed to allow any child in need to apply for admission, regardless of the family's affiliation or lack thereof with the Moose.History of Mooseheart In the 1950s, a pediatrician conducting a longitudinal study of children's growth at Mooseheart recalled there was tension since he felt that the board of directors was conducting the study to prove the superiority of the white race. By the 1990s, Mooseheart was open to children of all races and predominantly enrolled minority children. In 1996, five Mooseheart employees were criminally charged with sexually abusing children.

It provided a link for commuters between southern Ohio border towns and West Virginia steel mills from 1926 to 1991. The overall length of the bridge is , including the approach of on the West Virginia side and on the Ohio side of the river. The highest point in the bridge is above the water line. Built in 1926, the bridge is likely the oldest cantilever truss bridge in West Virginia, and is the second oldest vehicular truss bridge over the entire Ohio River. It is currently unused, and missing approach spans on the Ohio side. , the bridge remains standing, with status regarding demolition unknown.  Construction  The bridge was designed as a cantilever truss bridge by J. E. Greiner Company, with the Vang Construction Company as contractors of the substructure; the J.E. Moss Iron Works and the Mt. Vernon Bridge Company as co-contractors of the superstructure. The R. R. Kitchen company of Wheeling had charge of placing the floor in the bridge. The bridge was constructed over 18 months starting in June 1925 at a cost of about $1.5 million, which is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. Funds were raised primarily through subscription by local residents. During construction, hundreds worked on the bridge, and one worker was killed: Fred Morning fell from a pier on the Benwood, West Virginia side to the ground below on June 12, 1926. Over seven million tons of structural steel was used in the construction of the bridge. Railroad track for streetcars was laid in the bridge deck, but never saw use. The bridge opened to traffic on December 22, 1926, with over 7,000 vehicles crossing it on its opening day.  Tolls  In order to cover the cost of construction, those crossing the bridge were charged a toll. Initially, a one-way trip cost 5 cents. For nearly 45 years, the toll remained unchanged until, in 1971, the toll was increased to 25 cents one-way, 40 cents round trip. The bridge began losing money in 1984, so the owners increased the toll once more to 50 cents one-way, one dollar round trip. The opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge, along with another bridge in nearby Moundsville was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the Bellaire Bridge by up to 50 per-cent in 1987.  Closure and planned demolition This bridge was closed to traffic on May 1, 1991 because the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) needed to demolish the approach ramp to the crossing on the Ohio side of the river in order to provide right-of-way for a relocated Ohio State Route 7, which would no longer service the bridge. ODOT paid $2.1 million in November 1990 to the Interstate Bridge Company, the bridge's owner, and demolished the ramp soon after its closure. The U.S. Route 250 and West Virginia Route 2 approaches on the West Virginia side were concurrently abandoned. The bridge was sold to Roger Barack, owner of a construction company in Bellaire, in March 1991. There were talks of building a new approach on the Ohio side, however, no action was ever taken. $895,000 of the Ohio Department of Transportation payment had been set aside for demolition of the bridge but no demolition came about. With assistance from then-state Senator Bob Ney, Barack approached ODOT about reopening the bridge, but those plans never bore fruit because \\"the costs involved far outweighed any potential for the bridge to function economically,\\" according to a 2003 letter from ODOT Deputy Director Randall F. Howard. In 2002, Benwood, West Virginia officials requested that the bridge be demolished as football-sized debris was falling onto the roadway below, but nothing was done. The United States Coast Guard had ordered the span demolished, and had fined Barack over $200,000 for his nonfeasance. The bridge was still in place in May 2005, The Plain Dealer describing it as \\"a decrepit nuisance that residents of both states are eager to demolish.\\" = Bob Ney controversy = Bob Ney, who had become a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, obtained a $1.7 million Federal grant in 2005 to fund demolition the bridge. This soon engendered controversy, due to Ney's preexisting personal and political ties to Barack. Before Bellaire switched from Ney's district to that of Ted Strickland as a result of Congressional redistricting driven by the results of the 2000 United States Census, Ney rented his Congressional office space from Barack for $1,800 a month. Ney also received campaign contributions of $6,000 from Barack and his wife, most recently in 1997. Along with this, Ney nominated Barack's son for appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. = Demolition = On May 20, 2010, Roger Barack announced that he had sold the bridge to Advanced Explosives Demolition (AED), a demolition company that has gained fame through their demolitions on the TLC reality show The Imploders, for USD 1. AED then sold the bridge to KDC Investments for USD 25,000, finalizing the deal on June 3, 2010. AED will be subcontracted to complete the demolition, with Delta Demolition, a local company, serving as the general contractor. The project originally was to be completed by September 28, 2010, but as has been historically typical with the bridge, delays have pushed the demolition back from a target of June 2011 to being indefinitely placed on hold. The current delay stems from disagreement between the contractor and Benwood, West Virginia officials over an escrow account being created to ensure demolition is completed once started. A Federal Court has ordered that the escrow account be in place by June 20, 2013, and the bridge be demolished within 8 months of the formation of the escrow account. The contractor faces a USD $1,000 per day fine for not meeting these conditions. Three companies have placed liens against the bridge claiming scrap rights, with at least two of those companies claiming they paid for exclusive scrapping rights. The next trial date is set for November 12, 2013.  Notable events  *On Independence Day, 4 July 1927, an interstate wedding took place on the span between Wheeling, West Virginia resident Roberta Pearl Thomas of, and Harry E.

Several versions of the Agreement were published, each adapted to address not only broad concerns but also specific issues during the fast changing revolutionary political environment of those years. The Agreements of the People have been most associated as the manifestos of the Levellers but were also published by the Agitators and the General Council of the New Model Army. Major published versions of the Agreement include: * \\"An Agreement of the People for a firme and present Peace, upon grounds of common right and freedome ...\\", presented to the Army Council in October 1647.

The major tenets of this first version of the Agreement were: freedom of religion, the frequent convening of new parliaments and equality for all under the law. These tenets also appeared in the later versions of the manifesto. As these basic proposals were queried, other provisions were added; for example Roman Catholics were exempt from the right to religious freedom, and the electorate was to be made up of adult male property holders. The Levellers hoped to base England's new constitution on the Agreement of the People, but in the end, the New Model Army based their demands on an alternative less revolutionary document, the Heads of Proposals, that was proposed and supported by the Grandees (senior officers) of the Army.

Located in Tinicum Township, the refuge is adjacent to the Philadelphia International Airport. Established in 1972 as the Tinicum National Environmental Center, it was renamed in 1991 after the late H. John Heinz III who had helped preserve Tinicum Marsh. The refuge serves to protect the largest remaining freshwater tidal marsh in Pennsylvania; approximately 350 acres (0.8 km2). When land acquisition is complete, the refuge will consist of 1200 acres (4.9 km2) of varied habitats. History Philadelphia is easily visible from the refuge. The history of Tinicum Marsh, the largest remaining freshwater tidal wetland in Pennsylvania, goes back to 1634 and the region's first settlements. Dutch, Swedish and English settlers diked and drained parts of the marsh for grazing. At that time, the vast tidal marshes stretched over 5,700 acres (23 km2). Rapid urbanization since World War I has reduced tidal marshes to approximately 200 acres (0.8 km2). The remnant of this once vast tidal marsh is protected by the refuge. A diked, non-tidal area of 145 acres (0.6 km2), adjacent to the eastern end of Tinicum marsh, was donated by the Gulf Oil Corporation to the City of Philadelphia in 1955. This area, administered for the benefit of wildlife and people, was known as Tinicum Wildlife Preserve. The areas of open water along with the adjacent heavily vegetated tidal wetlands, formed an ideal habitat for thousands of migratory waterfowl. The marsh was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1965. In 1969, the remaining area was threatened by plans to route Interstate 95 through it and by a sanitary landfill on the tidal wetlands. These activities started a long series of injunctions, public hearings and extraordinary efforts by private and public groups to secure rerouting of the highway (completed in 1985) and termination of the landfill operation. Among these groups was The Philadelphia Conservationists, a group of bird watchers who, following the success of efforts to protect the marshes at Tinicum, went on to conserve natural areas along the east coast and were incorporated in 1961 as Natural Lands Trust, a conservation organization that continues to conserve and steward open land in Pennsylvania and New Jersey out of its headquarters in Media, Pennsylvania. Under legislation passed by Congress in 1972, authorization was given to the Secretary of the Interior to acquire 1200 acres (4.9 km2) to establish the Tinicum National Environmental Center. In November 1991, in a bill sponsored by Congressman Curt Weldon (R-PA), the name of the refuge was changed to John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum to honor the late Senator who helped preserve Tinicum Marsh. Topography Boardwalk and impoundment The refuge has five varied habitats: freshwater tidal marsh, impounded water, woods, meadow and field. The diversity of such habitats in such a concentrated area make it a natural magnet for all forms of wildlife. In addition to the above-mentioned there are a wide variety of fish species that can be found in both, Darby Creek, the lifeblood of Tinicum Marsh, as well as the 145 acre (0.6 km2) impoundment and the smaller, Hoy's Pond. They include brown bullhead, channel catfish, crappie, carp and small striped bass that utilize the wider expanses of Darby Creek, just before its confluence with the Delaware River, in the earlier stages of their development. The fields and meadows provide open areas where wide arrays of insects including several species of butterflies can be found foraging the dozens of species of wildflowers. Wildlife and protected species The Refuge is home to a variety of wildlife despite its urban location. Birdwatchers have recorded over 300 species of birds in and around the Refuge, 85 of which nest here. Migratory birds like warblers, egrets, sandpipers, and a large variety of ducks, within the Atlantic Flyway, use the refuge as a resting/feeding spot during spring and fall flights. Since water levels can be controlled in the impoundment, the water is often drained in early fall at the refuge. This serves both to reduce the large population of invasive carp and makes the impoundment a large mudflat, which renders it very attractive to migrating shorebirds. The water levels is raised later in the fall so waterfowl can use the impoundment. In addition, deer, opossums, red foxes, raccoons, coyotes, beavers, river otters, minks, woodchucks, and muskrats take refuge here along with a wide variety of wildflowers and plants. Bats are frequently observed by visitors on the refuge during warmer seasons and a formal species diversity and population survey would provide valuable information on recent declines of these important creatures due to white nose syndrome and habitat disturbances. There are several species of reptiles and amphibians that call the refuge home including the northern water, garter and Northern brown snakes; pickerel, wood and southern leopard frogs (the latter listed as endangered in Pennsylvania) and the state threatened American red- bellied turtle as well as the painted, snapping and eastern box turtles. Climate John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum lies in the transition zone between the Temperate Continental climate to the north and the Humid subtropical climate to the south. According to the Trewartha climate classification system, the refuge has a Temperate Oceanic climate (Do) with hot summers (a), cool winters (k) and year-around precipitation. Doak climates are characterized by all months having an average mean temperature > , four to seven months with an average mean temperature ≥ , at least one month with an average mean temperature ≥ and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. Although most summer days are moderately humid at John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, episodes of heat and high humidity can occur with heat index values > . Since 1981, the highest air temperature was on 07/22/2011, and the highest average mean dew point was on 07/15/1995. The average wettest month is July which corresponds with the annual peak in thunderstorm activity. Since 1981, the wettest calendar day was 6.58 inches (167 mm) on 08/27/2011. During the winter months, the plant hardiness zone is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . Since 1981, the coldest air temperature was on 01/22/1984. Episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values < . Ice storms and large snowstorms depositing ≥ 12 inches (30 cm) occur once every several years, particularly during nor’easters from December through February. Facilities Morton Mortensen Cabin =Trails= There are over of trails, including the popular \\"Impoundment Trail\\", and two boardwalks that cross the impoundment and one of its smaller coves. Trail segments are a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida. =Canoeing= A segment of Darby Creek flows through the refuge allowing canoeists to see a variety of plants and animals. Points of interest around the Creek's deep water lagoon are: #The Sun Oil Company tank farm; #The defunct Delaware County Sewer Treatment Plant; #Action Concrete's Recycling operation; #The Folcroft Landfill (active from 1956–74), now capped and monitored; #The historic Morton Mortensen House in Norwood's Winona Park, built in the early eighteenth century by adding to an old Swedish house built 60 years before, and believed to be the oldest man-made structure in Pennsylvania. =Fishing= Fishing is permitted along the main dike trail and the connecting Trolley Bed trail. This area provides fishing in both the 145 acre (0.6 km2) impoundment and Darby Creek. Common fish are carp, catfish, large-mouth bass and smaller panfish. Another fishing area is near Tinicum and Prospect Park on the west side of Route 420 which provides access to the lagoon areas of the Refuge. Common fish in this area are striped bass, carp, catfish, panfish, and tiger musky. However, due to the preserve's urban location, the stream has been polluted with various industrial chemicals. As a result, signs have been put into place in order to discourage the consumption of the fish that reside in the stream.

He continued to appear until the end of the series with issue #62 (Sept 1949). The character was later obtained by DC Comics, though by that time he had already lapsed into the public domain. Some of his Golden Age adventures were reprinted by AC Comics in the Men of Mystery anthology. He is not to be confused with another DC Comics property named Triumph. Origin Lance Gallant meets his dead brother Michael. Crack Comics #27. Art by Alfred Andriola. In 1919 twin brothers Michael and Lance Gallant are born in New York City. They are so alike, even down to a T-shaped birthmark on their left wrists, that their own mother cannot tell them apart. The two remain close, even for twins, as they grow up. When America is drawn into the Second World War, Michael enlists in the U.S. Army Air Corps, becoming a pilot, while Lance \\"crusaded with his own weapons – the word and pen\\" by becoming a journalist. However, on Michael's 23rd birthday, as he brings his plane in to land, the hangar he is entering explodes. His fiancée, Kim Meredith, and brother Lance witness this act of sabotage, and the latter races into the burning structure, managing to find his badly injured sibling, only for Michael to die in his arms. Lance swears vengeance on the murderers and those like them. Unknown to him, the Fates, creatures of myth, are watching all this and, impressed, decide to create a champion. Soon afterwards Lance receives a shocking visitation from Michael's ghost, who reveals that they remain linked together, and if Lance touches his birthmark they will merge, gaining superpowers as a result. Touching the mark a second time will separate them again. Calling himself Captain Triumph, Lance becomes a crimefighter.Crack Comics #27. Creative teams The identity of the writer is unremembered, but as the series opens, the artist is Alfred Andriola, former assistant to Milton Caniff on Terry and the Pirates (Andriola had also drawn a newspaper comic based on author Earl Derr Biggers's famous character Charlie Chan). He stays with Captain Triumph a mere six months,Crack Comics #s 24 thru 32. leaving to create the character he's best remembered for, Kerry Drake. The artists in the middle issues of Captain Triumph's Crack Comics run are mostly a matter of conjecture, as Golden Age artists frequently did not sign their work. However, beginning in Crack Comics #46 and ending only with the book's cancellation, Captain Triumph's adventures are penciled and inked for an unbroken 17-issue run by Golden Age great Reed Crandall. Costume The cover to Crack Comics #54, one of only four times the character was shown with light blue jodhpurs. Don Markstein on his Toonopedia site has stated that as time went by Captain Triumph’s jodhpurs were changed in color from white to light blue, however this is untrue. Cap’s pants were only ever colored so on four covers late in the run (#s 49, 52, 54 and 58), and on every other cover, including those of the late run – and all of the interior pages throughout the entire series – they are always white. Art by Reed Crandall. Captain Triumph has a minimal costume consisting of a plain, red, short-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt, ordinary white jodhpurs, a brown belt, brown riding boots, and no mask. Comic book historian Don Markstein has commented: \\"By the time Cap appeared in 1943, the tide of superhero comic book characters was receding somewhat. Captain Triumph's costume was just enough to get across the idea he was a superhero, but since the genre was fading did not emphasize the fact\\". Don Markstein’s Toonopedia page on Captain Triumph. Captain Triumph belongs to that select class of superheroes who, like Superman/Clark Kent, is never recognized in his superhero identity, even when being seen, by the same person, as Captain Triumph immediately after being seen as Lance Gallant and vice versa – despite the fact that he wears no mask and does not even have Clark Kent's glasses to disguise his face. Supporting cast Kim Meredith is introduced in Captain Triumph's first appearance as Michael Gallant's fiancée. In his second appearance, both Michael's ghost and Lance jointly tell her the secret of Captain Triumph.Crack Comics #28. An extremely strong-willed young woman, thereafter she is Cap's devoted and trustworthy helper and confidante. In one adventure, after being kidnapped, she refuses to give her captor any information on Captain Triumph even though she is beaten \\"…until [her] face is covered with blood and welts and open wounds\\".Crack Comics #31. Eventually she becomes Lance's fiancée, as well.”Crack Comics #56. Captain Triumph with his partners in adventure, Kim Meredith and Biff (and another appearance of the light blue jodhpurs). Crack Comics #49. Art by Reed Crandall. In his fourth appearance, Captain Triumph encounters a down-on-his-luck professional clown named Biff who is on the verge of being fired from his job. Sympathizing, Cap uses his powers of flight and invisibility to ensure that Biff’s next show is spectacular. However, even though in the aftermath his job as a clown is at least temporarily assured, after being drawn into one of Cap’s adventures, and thoroughly enjoying it, Biff readily accepts Lance Gallant’s offer to become his personal assistant.Crack Comics #30. Though Lance Gallant is presented as being born into \\"a middle-class family\\"Crack Comics #27. and at the time supposedly has as income only his journalist's pay, he has no problem affording a personal, live-in assistant. Thereafter the burly former clown serves as Lance, Michael and Captain Triumph's steadfast friend and backup muscle.”And Biff – a loyal, faithful pal! Call him stubborn, stupid, funny - but he’s square!” Michael Gallant, Crack Comics #39. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"his enemies include Sydney Greenstreet-like Spade the Ruthless, the mad scientist Dr. Vossburg (\\"the Man Who Conquered Flame\\"), the Nazi spy the Raven (and his stolen sonic death grenades), and the unspeaking criminal mastermind known only as Silent\\". Eventually Lance, Kim and Biff wind up co-owners in a successful gold mine,Crack Comics #42. and Biff buys shares in a “record-breaking” oil well,Crack Comics #49. but though this makes them all independently wealthy they continue to stay, and adventure, together. Personality Before Michael's death, and his merging with Lance to become Captain Triumph, the two are extraordinarily close, and alike, even for twins: \\"As they grew, the bonds of love and companionship that existed between them became stronger than any bond of steel or cable of strength that man could manufacture. So close were they, that in their work, their play, and the exciting adventures that filled their lives, their bodies responded but to one mind\\".Crack Comics #27. Both twins are intelligent, daring, and athletic. Though they are presented as being very similar, throughout the series it becomes obvious that Lance is the more thoughtful, and intellectually inclined of the two, while Michael is more the daredevil,”Thoughtful Lance Gallant knows how to call up the ghost of his daredevil brother, Michael - together they are mystically combined into Captain Triumph!” Crack Comics” #36. witness their differing vocations of journalist and military pilot, respectively. When the twins merge into Captain Triumph, they form a composite personality, with neither obviously dominant, and when they split apart again they are both aware of everything that has occurred to them as Captain Triumph. Powers The Fates discuss the state of the world, and their newly created champion, Captain Triumph. Crack Comics #28. Art by Alfred Andriola When Lance Gallant merges with the ghost of his brother Michael, the two form Captain Triumph. Within the context of this series, the Fates are presented as three hag-like crones, sisters named Chance, Destiny and Fortune.Crack Comics #28. They give Captain Triumph three \\"ghostly\\" powers: flight, invisibility and near invulnerability. As Michael Gallant says when his spirit first appears to his brother: \\"I can make you invisible! You shall fly through space within seconds! Nothing physical will harm you!\\"Crack Comics #27. When the brothers are separated into two individuals, Michael, as a ghost, can move through walls, spy invisibly and then report back to Lance. On the initial occasion, when Michael reveals his existence to KimCrack Comics #28. she is able to see and hear him. Thereafter, though Lance can always definitely see and hear Michael, whether Kim or Biff can do so is inconsistently presented throughout the series - and sometimes within the same story. With intense concentration, Michael is able to communicate with, and influence the actions of, other people and creatures. When the Jacksons are threatened, Michael is able to influence April, the daughter of the family, that she should write to Lance Gallant for help.Crack Comics #37. In “The Castle of Shadows!” he controls a rat to gnaw through ropes binding KimCrack Comics #38. and he compels a criminal to not search the hiding place of an important document.Crack Comics #43. Captain Triumph has the ability to alter his physical appearance, shape and size, and at the same time change his voice, a power that comes in very handy when his adventures require impersonation.Crack Comics #s 28, 31. One of the powers given to Captain Triumph by the Fates is the ability to fly. Crack Comics #47. Art by Reed Crandall Captain Triumph also has limited super-strength. He can stop a racing car by either grabbing its bumperCrack Comics #35. or standing in front of it and punching it,Crack Comics #42. bend rifle barrels,Crack Comics #38. break chainsCrack Comics #s 36, 41, 54, 59. and snap rifle bayonetsCrack Comics #32. with his bare hands. He can also punch through a brick wall,Crack Comics #40, 42. steel bank vault doorsCrack Comics #45. and jail bars,Crack Comics #49. and routinely holds his own in physical confrontations against multiple, normal human attackers much larger than he is. However, his opponents are never seriously injured, and sometimes not even disabled, by his full-power enthusiastic blows. Captain Triumph is almost but not completely invulnerable. On numerous occasions he is shot repeatedly, and the bullets have no effect.Crack Comics #s 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49, 53, 54, 55, 56.

He survives a pointblank bazooka blast with no damage.Crack Comics #50. Being shot with an atomic beam that can cut through anything (and does in fact easily cut an oceangoing freighter completely in two) only causes him to laugh and say, \\"I’m ticklish!\\"Crack Comics #28. When faced with a powerful \\"explosive pill\\" about to go off and wreck a defense factory, his solution to the problem is to simply swallow the pill.Crack Comics #31. However, being exposed to the sonic vibrations of a \\"screaming bomb\\" that kills normal people does render him temporarily unconscious.Crack Comics #34. Publication history =Crack Comics= Crack Comics started out as a monthly title, like most 1940s anthology comic books, but dropped down to bi-monthly shortly after World War II began, due to wartime paper shortages. It switched to quarterly about a year after Captain Triumph joined the lineup. When the war was over, most surviving anthologies ramped back up to monthly, but Crack Comics only ever got back to bi-monthly (coming out in odd-numbered months). But it did outlast most of the others, succumbing with its 62nd issue, dated September 1949. Captain Triumph's only appearances during the Golden Age were within 36 issues of Crack Comics, from his introduction in #27 until the book's cancellation with #62. However he was the lead feature within, and appeared on the cover of, every one of those issues. =The End of Quality Comics= By the mid-1950s, with television and paperback books drawing readers away from comic books in general and superheroes in particular, interest in Quality's characters had declined considerably. After a foray into other genres such as war, humor, romance and horror, the company ceased operations with comics cover dated December 1956. Many of its properties were sold to National Periodical Publications (now DC Comics) which chose to keep only a few titles running, such as Blackhawk and G.I. Combat. Though it owned the rights to Captain Triumph, DC would not use the character for several more decades. =The All-Star Squadron= Captain Triumph appears on the cover of the first issue of All-Star Squadron as one of a group of photos spread over a table, along with the tag line \\"Who Will Be the Heroes of the....All-Star Squadron\\" although he does not actually appear within the issue - or anywhere else in the series, for that matter.All-Star Squadron #1. Writer Roy Thomas indicates he always intended to use Captain Triumph in All-Star Squadron but never got around to it before the title was cancelled.http://comicsmakenosense.blogspot.com/2010/06/martyrdom-of-captain- triumph-monday.html Comics Make No Sense. =Animal Man= Captain Triumph appears in flashback in a small cameo in one issue of Grant Morrison's Animal Man series, fighting the unsuccessful supervillain The Red Mask who describes him as possessing \\"the personality of a deck chair\\". Given his characterization in this story - admittedly from The Red Mask's not exactly unbiased viewpoint - that is not an entirely inaccurate assessment.Animal Man #7. =The Titans= Captain Triumph retires from action at an unknown time. Lance later appears in The Titans as a friend of Jesse Quick's mother, the aged heroine Liberty Belle. Michael is still present as a spirit but has apparently gone psychotic in the many years of inactivity. The twins discover a love affair between Jesse and her mother's young fiancé. Lance tries to confront the fiancé on the matter but is taken over by Michael's ghost, who as Captain Triumph quickly murders the man for his infidelity to his friend.The Titans #36. Jim Shelley on Flashback Universe refers to this tale of an insane, murdering Captain Triumph as \\"his last appearance…probably best forgotten\\".http://flashbackuniverse.blogspot.com/2010/01/free-comics-monday- captain-triumph.html “Free Comics Monday: Captain Triumph.” =Female version= A new, female Captain Triumph debuts in Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters. This version only demonstrates super-strength and the ability to fly.Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters #3. = Next Issue Project = In November 2011, Captain Triumph appears, as part of Image Comics' Next Issue Project, in Crack Comics #63, written and penciled by Alan Weiss. = Harley Quinn = In 2019's Harley Quinn #50-51, the Golden Age hero Captain Triumph gets stranded in the 21st century without Michael after Harley accidentally \\"destroyed continuity\\", according to Jonni DC, Continuity Cop. Other versions =The Golden Age= Captain Triumph's most substantive post-Golden Age appearance is in The Golden Age, a four-issue prestige format miniseries in DC Comics' Elseworlds line, written by James Robinson with art by Paul Smith. In it, Lance Gallant has retired as Captain Triumph and is trying to lead a normal life, despite his brother's ghost urging him to become a hero again.The Golden Age #1. When he meets the reformed supervillain the Tigress, he falls in love with her. In the end he refuses to listen to his brother's pleas and dies fighting the original Golden Age Robotman as a normal man, defending the Tigress.The Golden Age #4. James Robinson intended that The Golden Age be canon, and his subsequent series Starman assumed that many of the events in The Golden Age (for instance Ted Knight, the original Starman, having a nervous breakdown after his research was used to help create the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki) actually happened. However The Golden Age has always been classed as a non-canonical \\"imaginary story\\" by DC's powers-that-be.
