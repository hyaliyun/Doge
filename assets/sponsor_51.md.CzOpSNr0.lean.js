Although classified officially rated as a ts≈´h≈çkan, meaning dispatch boat or aviso, the class were essentially small protected cruisers. The Yodo class was followed by the larger, more conventional .Conway, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1905‚Äì1922, page 236 Background The Yodo-class cruisers were designed and built domestically in Japan, having been ordered as part of the 1904 Emergency Fleet Replenishment Program to recover from losses to the Japanese navy from the Russo-Japanese War but were not laid down until after the war had ended with the Treaty of Portsmouth due to delays in construction. The class consisted of two vessels; the leadship of the class, the was named after the Yodo River outside Osaka, Japan and was laid down in Kawasaki Shipyards in Kobe in 1906. Yodos sister ship, , named after the Mogami River in northern Honsh≈´, Japan, was laid down in the Mitsubishi Yards in Nagasaki the following year. The lightly armed and lightly armored Yodo-class vessels were intended for scouting, high speed reconnaissance, and to serve as dispatch vessels. However, they were already obsolete when designed, with the development of wireless communication used during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. Both ships were reclassified as first class gunboats on 12 October 1912. Design The design of the two Yodo-class cruisers differed noticeably. Not only was Mogami larger and heavier than Yodo, it also had a straight raked bow with three smokestacks, compared to Yodo which had a clipper bow and two smokestacks. Another significant difference between the two ships was their propulsion systems, while Yodo had a conventional two shaft, four cylinder reciprocating (VTE) engines with four Miyabara boilers, Mogami has the distinction of being the first Parsons-type turbine-powered vessel in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Yodo class was armed with two QF 4.7-inch guns at fore and aft of the ship with a secondary armament of QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval guns. The Yodo class was armed with three torpedo tubes. Armour protection of the Yodo class consisted of of Krupp armour on the deck and on the conning tower. The design did not incorporate any side armour. Ships in class Two ships were budgeted for and completed under the 1904 Emergency Fleet Replenishment Program, one each from the Kawasaki Shipyards, Kobe and Mitsubishi Yards, Nagasaki. Both ships served in World War I. The Yodo additionally in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the first months of World War II, and were scrapped before the outbreak of the Pacific War.  Yodo was completed on 8 April 1908, at the Kawasaki Shipyards. Initially assigned to training and coastal duties, Yodo was reclassified as a first class gunboat on 12 October 1912. During World War I, Yodo was present at the Siege of Tsingtao and the Japanese invasion of German New Guinea. After the war Yodo was assigned to survey and miscellaneous auxiliary along the coast of China until the Manchurian Incident in 1931. During the 1930s Yodo would be assigned patrol duties along the coast of the Republic of China, with her patrol range extended during after the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Yodo was demilitarized on 1 April 1940 and renamed Hulk #13. It remained moored to a pier at Iwakuni throughout World War II, and was finally broken up for scrap in 1945.  Mogami was completed on 16 September 1908, at the Mitsubishi Yards. Initially assigned to training and coastal duties, Mogami was reclassified as a first class gunboat on 12 October 1912. Mogami was part of the Japanese fleet at the Siege of Tsingtao in World War I, and assisted in the sinking of the German torpedo boat S90. From 1917-1921, Mogami was assigned to patrol duties in the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands after Japan's capture of those island groups from Germany. From 1921-1928, Mogami was assigned to patrols off of the Siberian coast, and to fishery patrol duties, during the period of Japan‚Äôs Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Mogami was scrapped on 1 April 1928. Although Mogami was considered the more modern and advanced in design, with her higher speed and turbine engine, she was retired much earlier than her sister ship, Yodo, largely due to performance and maintenance issues with her engines.

She specializes in biomedical applications of mass spectrometry. She has been recognized as an outstanding scientist in the field of bioanalytical chemistry because of her work using mass spectrometry to study biomolecules. Early life and education Catherine Lee Clarke was born on 15 April 1939, in York, Nebraska. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1961 with an Artium baccalaureus in chemistry. She received a Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1965 from Stanford University, working with Carl Djerassi. As a field, organic mass spectrometry was new and had great potential impact for the pharmaceutical industry. The mass spectrometer was a new tool for examining the structures of small botanical molecules. Djerassi's lab examined electron ionization of molecules, studying basic mechanisms such as fragmentation and hydrogen transfer. For her thesis research, Catherine made a series of deuterium labeled analogues of amines, alcohols, esters and amides.  Career  She spent the next two years in postdoctoral positions, studying on a 1965‚Äì1966 fellowship from the American Association of University Women at the University of California, Berkeley with Melvin Calvin. In 1967, she worked at the Space Sciences Laboratory with Melvin Calvin and A. L. Burlingame. Calvin's lab was developing methods to be used in the analysis of lunar rock samples. Fenselau described an analysis technique for preparing lipid samples from moon rocks, before actual lunar samples were available for testing. = Johns Hopkins School of Medicine = Fenselau was the first trained mass spectroscopist to join a medical faculty when she joined the mass spectrometry laboratory in the Pharmacology Department at Johns Hopkins University in 1968. When she arrived, Johns Hopkins did not have a mass spectrometer. Fenselau did her initial research by driving to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) laboratories to use their instruments. Paul Talalay, chairman of Pharmacology, and Albert L. Lehninger, the chairman of Biological Chemistry, submitted proposals for funding for a state of the art mass spectrometer. They were successful in obtaining funding from the National Science Foundation for a CEC 21-110 double-focusing mass spectrometer for Fenselau to use. She has done considerable work in the area of cancer and anti-cancer treatments, studying drugs such as cyclophosphamide. With oncologist O. M. Colvin, she identified the active metabolite of cyclophosphamide, and published the first quantification of the drug and its metabolites in urine and blood from patients. She led the development of synthetic and analytical methods for glucuronides, and studied the reactions of acyl-linked glucuronides with Martin Stogniew, work that has been important in understanding drug-derived liver disease. = University of Maryland = Although Fenselau and her second husband Robert Cotter both worked in mass spectrometry at Johns Hopkins, they chose to develop independent careers rather than a joint lab. \\"We felt that we could make twice as many contributions to science if we had two separate labs and evolved in our own ways that reflected our own skills and our own institutions.\\" In 1987, Catherine Fenselau moved to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) to become chairperson of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. She chose the university in part because she wanted greater opportunities for teaching. At UMBC she was one of the first faculty members involved in the Meyerhoff Scholarship Program, an initiative of UBMC president Freeman Hrabowski to attract minority undergraduate researchers. There, funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and others enabled Fenselau to establish a state- of-the-art mass spectrometry lab, the Structural Biochemistry Center (SBC). Equipment included a JEOL HX110/110 four-sector tandem mass spectrometer, a Hewlett-Packard quadrupole mass spectrometer with particle beam and Vestec electrospray ion sources, and 500 and 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. Research areas studied in the lab included biopolymer structure, ion thermochemistry, proton-binding entropies, glucuronide and glutathione conjugation, and possible mechanisms for acquired drug resistance. In June 1987, Fenselau oversaw the installation of a HighResMALDI Fourier transform mass spectrometer in her lab. The Fourier mass spectrometer used a strong electrical field to trap and excite ions and measure the resulting electrical signals. Appointed Chairperson of the Department of Chemistry at University of Maryland, College Park in 1998, Fenselau supervised the disassembly, transport, and reassembly of the complex instrument, moving it safely to her new lab. With it, she has studied the chemistry of gaseous ions, chemical reactions of drugs with proteins, and posttranslational modification in protein biosynthesis. In 2005, she acted as the interim Dean for the College of Graduate Studies and Associate Vice President for Research in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. She has been president of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry (ASMS), founding president of US-HUPO (Human Proteome Organization), and senior vice president of international HUPO. She was the founding editor of Biomedical Mass Spectrometry (now the Journal of Mass Spectrometry) and associate editor of Analytical Chemistry. She has published more than 350 peer-reviewed articles. Catherine Fenselau continues to teach at the University of Maryland College Park. More than 150 post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduate students have received training in her laboratories at Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the University of Maryland, College Park. Awards Dr. Fenselau has received a number of significant awards, including the following. * Garvan Medal, 1985 as a distinguished woman in chemistry. * Maryland Chemist of the Year, American Chemical Society, 1989. * National Institutes of Health MERIT Award, 1991-2001. * Field & Franklin Award for Contributions in Mass spectrometry, American Chemical Society (ACS), 2008. * Thomson Medal, International Mass Spectrometry Foundation, 2009. * Ralph N. Adams Award in Bioanalytical Chemistry, 2010 * Distinguished Contribution Award, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, 2012.  Personal life  Fenselau was married twice, first to Allan H.

His cosmology research, conducted at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, focuses on observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to reveal signatures of the physics that drove the birth of the universe, the creation of its structure, and its present-day expansion. Currently, Kovac is Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Harvard University.  Education and early life  Kovac was born in Princeton, New Jersey. He attended Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida. He received a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Princeton University. He went on to the University of Chicago to receive a Masters and Doctorate in Physics in 2004. His thesis advisor was John Carlstrom.  Career  He was the principal investigator of the BICEP2 telescope, which was part of the BICEP and Keck Array series of experiments. Measurements announced on 17 March 2014 from the BICEP2 telescope appeared to support the idea of cosmic inflation, by reporting the first evidence for a primordial B-Mode pattern in the polarization of the CMB. Further analysis revealed this result to be spurious, and that the signal had been contaminated by interstellar dust in the Milky Way. Prior to BICEP2, as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Kovac worked on the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer led by John Carlstrom, which in 2002 announced the first detection of polarization in the CMB. In 2003, Kovac moved to Caltech as a Millikan Postdoctoral Fellow, beginning work under Andrew Lange on the QUaD telescope and on BICEP1, the predecessor of BICEP2. After BICEP1's deployment to the South Pole in 2006, at Lange's invitation Kovac joined the research faculty of Caltech as a Kilroy Fellow and led the team that proposed BICEP2. In 2009 Kovac joined the faculty at Harvard University.  Awards  In 2013 Kovac received the National Science Foundation Career Award. In 2011 Kovac was selected as a Sloan Research Fellow.

Hobby Lobby, 573 U.S. 682 (2014), is a landmark decision in United States corporate law by the United States Supreme Court allowing closely held for-profit corporations to be exempt from a regulation its owners religiously object to, if there is a less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest, according to the provisions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). It is the first time that the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief, but it is limited to closely held corporations. The decision does not address whether such corporations are protected by the free-exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution. For such companies, the Court's majority directly struck down the contraceptive mandate, a regulation adopted by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requiring employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees, by a 5‚Äì4 vote.See: The court said that the mandate was not the least restrictive way to ensure access to contraceptive care, noting that a less restrictive alternative was being provided for religious non-profits, until the Court issued an injunction 3 days later, effectively ending said alternative, replacing it with a government-sponsored alternative for any female employees of closely held corporations that do not wish to provide birth control.See: * The ruling is considered to be part of the political controversy regarding the Affordable Care Act in the United States.  Background  = Federal law =  Religious Freedom Restoration Act  The United States Supreme Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) that a person may not defy neutral laws of general applicability even as an expression of religious belief. \\"To permit this,\\" wrote Justice Scalia, citing the 1878 Reynolds v. United States decision, \\"would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. \\" He wrote that generally applicable laws do not have to meet the standard of strict scrutiny, because such a requirement would create \\"a private right to ignore generally applicable laws\\". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. In 1993, the US Congress responded by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability \\"substantially burden[s] a person's exercise of religion\\". The RFRA was amended in 2000 by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) to redefine exercise of religion as any exercise of religion, \\"whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief\\", which is to be \\"construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution\\". The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the RFRA as applied to federal statutes in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita in 2006.  Affordable Care Act  Of those Americans who have health insurance, most are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which relies on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of preventive care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. HHS exempted religious employers (churches and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order), non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception, employers providing grandfathered plans (that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees. The HRSA decided that all twenty contraceptives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be covered. Companies that refuse are fined $100 per individual per day, or they can replace their health coverage with higher wages and a calibrated tax. = Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties = Hobby Lobby is an arts and crafts company founded by self-made billionaire David Green and owned by the Evangelical Christian Green family with about 21,000 employees. It provided health insurance covering the contraceptives Plan-B and Ella until it dropped its coverage in 2012, the year it filed its lawsuit. The Hobby Lobby case also involved Mardel Christian and Educational Supply, which is owned by Mart Green, one of David's sons. Hobby Lobby's case was consolidated with another case by Conestoga Wood Specialties, a furniture company owned by the Mennonite Hahn family that has about 1,000 employees, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom.  Specific contraceptives contested by plaintiffs  The plaintiffs believed that life began at conception which they equated to fertilization, and objected to their businesses providing health insurance coverage to their female employees of four FDA-approved contraceptives that the plaintiffs believed prevented implantation of a fertilized egg. The plaintiffs believed these forms of contraception constituted an abortion.: * Emergency contraceptive pills ** levonorgestrel (sold under the brand name Plan B among others) ** ulipristal acetate (sold under the brand name Ella among others) * Intrauterine devices (IUDs) ** copper IUDs (sold under the brand name ParaGard among others) ** Hormonal IUDs (sold under the brand names Mirena and Skyla among others) = Lower court history = In September 2012, Hobby Lobby filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against enforcement of the contraception rule based on the RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. On November 19, 2012, U.S. District Judge Joe L. Heaton denied Hobby Lobby's request for a preliminary injunction. On December 26, 2012, Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued an in-chambers opinion denying an injunction pending appeal. In March 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit granted a hearing of the case. In June, the appeals court ruled that Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. is a person who has religious freedom. Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich wrote for the five-judge en banc majority, over a three-judge dissent.Recent Cases: Tenth Circuit Holds For-Profit Corporate Plaintiffs Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Substantial Burden on Religious Claim, 127 Harv. L. Rev. 1025 (2014). Neil Gorsuch voted with the majority and also wrote an opinion on the case. The court ordered the government to stop enforcement of the contraception rule on Hobby Lobby and sent the case back to the district court, which granted preliminary injunction in July. In September, the government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Two other federal appeals courts ruled against the contraception coverage rule, while another two upheld it. The case was previously titled Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby. Sylvia Burwell was automatically substituted as petitioner when she was approved by the United States Senate as the Secretary of Health and Human Services after being nominated by President Barack Obama to replace Kathleen Sebelius following Sebelius' resignation on April 10, 2014.  U.S. Supreme Court consideration  = Acceptance and briefs = On November 26, the Supreme Court accepted and consolidated the case with Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius. Two dozen amicus briefs support the government, and five dozen support the companies. American Freedom Law Center's brief argues that birth control harms women because men will only want them \\"for the satisfaction of [their] own desires.\\" Another brief argues that the contraception rule leads to \\"the maximization of sexual activity\\". Two of the briefs oppose each other on the constitutionality of the RFRA. Two briefs that do not formally take sides oppose each other on whether the right to religion applies to corporations. One of those briefs argues that if shareholders are separated by the corporate veil from corporate liabilities, then their religious values are also separate from the corporation. It mentions the ruling in Domino's Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald made against the African American owner of JWM Investments whose contracts were breached due to racial discrimination. The brief argues that if JWM Investments could not suffer discrimination through its owner, then Hobby Lobby could not suffer religious burden through its owner. Two briefs were filed by LGBT groups concerned that future anti-discrimination laws would be pre-emptively harmed if employers could claim to be religiously exempt. = Argument and deliberation = Oral arguments were held on March 25, 2014 for 30 minutes more than the usual one hour. The three women in the court focused their questioning on Hobby Lobby's lawyer, Paul Clement, while the men focused on the administration's lawyer, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. Justice Sotomayor quoted the ruling from United States v. Lee (1982) saying that an employer can't deprive employees of a statutory right because of religious beliefs. Clement replied that Lee does not apply because it was a challenge against a tax rather than against a significant burden. Sotomayor said that instead of paying the burden of the penalty, Hobby Lobby could replace its health care with the equivalent expense of higher wages and a calibrated tax, which the government would use to pay for the employees' health care. Near the end of Clement's argument, Justice Kennedy expressed concern for the rights of the employees who may not agree with the religious beliefs of their employers. When Verrilli argued that the ruling in Cutter v. Wilkinson requires the court to weigh the impact on third parties in every RFRA case, Justice Scalia said that the RFRA does not require the court to balance the interest of the religious objector to the interest of other individuals. Verilli returned to Lee, saying that granting an exemption to an employer should not impose the employer's religious faith on the employees.  Opinion of the Court  = Majority opinion = Justice Samuel Alito was the author of the Court's majority opinion. On June 30, 2014, Associate Justice Samuel Alito delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) joined him to strike down the HHS mandate, as applied to closely held corporations with religious objections, and to prevent the plaintiffs from being compelled to provide contraception under their healthcare plans. The ruling was reached on statutory grounds, citing the RFRA, because the mandate was not the \\"least restrictive\\" method of implementing the government's interest. The ruling did not address Hobby Lobby's claims under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The court argued that the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of shareholders, officers, and employees., slip op. at 24 (2014). It said that \\"allowing Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the religious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns.\\" The court found that for-profit corporations could be considered persons under the RFRA. It noted that the HHS treats nonprofit corporations as persons within the meaning of RFRA. The court stated, \\"no conceivable definition of the term includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations.\\" Responding to lower court judges' suggestion that the purpose of for-profit corporations \\"is simply to make money\\", the court said, \\"For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives.\\" The court rejected the contention that \\"the Nation lacks a tradition of exempting for-profit corporations from generally applicable laws,\\" pointing to a federal statute from 1993 that exempted any covered health care entity from engaging in \\"certain activities related to abortion\\". The court held that the HHS contraception mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion, rejecting an argument that the $2,000-per-employee penalty for dropping insurance coverage is less than the average cost of health insurance. Responding to HHS's argument that the provision of coverage does not itself result in destruction of embryos, the Court asserted that the argument dodges the substantial burden question that the Court is supposed to address. The Court added, citing Jesuit moral manuals, that the argument is also the religious question of the morality of enabling the immoral acts of others, to which HHS had provided \\"a binding national answer\\". The Court argued that federal courts should not answer religious questions because they would in effect be deciding whether certain beliefs are flawed.134 S. Ct. 2751, 2778 fn.34 (citing David S. Oderberg, Ethics of Co-operation in Wrongdoing, in Modern Moral Philosophy 203-228 (A. O'Hear ed. 2004); Thomas Higgins S.J., Man as Man: The Science and Art of Ethics 353, 355 (1949); 1 Henry Davis S.J., Moral and Pastoral Theology 341 (1935). The court argued that \\"companies would face a competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting skilled workers,\\" that increased wages for employees to buy individual coverage would be more costly than group health insurance, that any raise in wages would have to take income taxes into account, and that employers cannot deduct the penalty. The court found it unnecessary to adjudicate on whether the HHS contraceptive mandate furthers a compelling government interest and held that HHS has not shown that the mandate is \\"the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest\\". The court argued that the most straightforward alternative would be \\"for the Government to assume the cost ...\\" and that HHS has not shown that it is not \\"a viable alternative\\". The court said that the RFRA can \\"require creation of entirely new programs\\". The court also pointed out that HHS already exempts any nonprofit organization from paying for any required contraception by allowing it to certify its religious objection to its insurance issuer, which must \\"[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered\\". However, the court said the approach might not necessarily be the least restrictive alternative for all religious claims. The court concluded by addressing \\"the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction\\". The court said that their decision \\"provides no such shield\\", and that \\"prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.\\" The court also said that the requirement to pay taxes despite any religious objection is different from the contraceptive mandate because \\"there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.\\" The court acknowledged the dissent's \\"worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from generally applicable laws ...\\", noting that this point was \\"made forcefully by the Court in Smith\\". The court responded by saying, \\"Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that 'the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests' ... The wisdom of Congress's judgment on this matter is not our concern. Our responsibility is to enforce RFRA as written, and under the standard that RFRA prescribes, the HHS contraceptive mandate is unlawful.\\" = Concurring opinion = Justice Kennedy, joined in the majority opinion but also wrote a concurring opinion addressing the dissent. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion, responding to the \\"respectful and powerful dissent\\", by emphasizing the limited nature of the ruling and saying that the government \\"makes the case that the mandate serves the Government's compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees\\", but that the RFRA's least-restrictive way requirement is not met because \\"there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage,\\" the one that HHS has devised for non-profit corporations with religious objections. \\"RFRA requires the Government to use this less restrictive means. As the Court explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise.\\" (Kennedy, J., concurring, pp. 3, 4) = Dissenting opinions = Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a stern dissent disagreeing with the Court's reasoning. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the primary dissent, which was joined by Justice Sotomayor in full and by Justices Breyer and Kagan as to all but Part III‚ÄìC‚Äì1 on \\"whether a corporation qualifies as a 'person' capable of exercising religion\\". Ginsburg began, \\"In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs. ... Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a 'less restrictive alternative.' And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, can pick up the tab.\\" She challenged the majority's unprecedented view of for-profit religion saying \\"Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized a for-profit corporation's qualification for a religious exemption from a generally applicable law, whether under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA. The absence of such precedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of religion is characteristic of natural persons, not artificial legal entities... Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community.\\" Responding to the majority's argument that the government should \\"assume the cost\\" of contraceptives, Ginsburg said that \\"the nation's only dedicated source of federal funding for safety net family planning services ...\\" is not designed to absorb the unmet needs of those already insured. She noted that \\"a less restrictive alternative\\" has not been written into law by Congress. Ginsburg warns, \\"The Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield ...\\" Justices Breyer and Kagan wrote a one-paragraph dissenting opinion, saying that \\"the plaintiffs' challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement fails on the merits\\" and that they \\"need not and do not decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\\"  Reactions  Barbara Green, co-founder of Hobby Lobby, said \\"Today, the nation's highest court has reaffirmed the vital importance of religious liberty as one of our country's founding principles. The court's decision is a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith.\\" Conestoga CEO Anthony Hahn said, \\"Americans don't have to surrender their freedom when they open a family business.\\" =Organizations= Conservative and pro-life groups praised the ruling. National Review said that the Supreme Court ruling \\"[led] Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Matt Bowman to call Hobby Lobby an 'inclusive decision' that advances everyone's freedom.\\" Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said, \\"This is a great victory for religious liberty ‚Äì the bedrock of our founding. In living out our religious convictions, there are certain things we must not do. This is why we are at a watershed moment. Religious people will no longer be ordered to take action that our religion says we must not take.\\" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said, \\"The Supreme Court has delivered one of the most significant victories for religious freedom in our generation. We are thankful the Supreme Court agreed that the government went too far by mandating that family businesses owners must violate their consciences under threat of crippling fines.\\" The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said, \\"We welcome the Supreme Court's decision to recognize that Americans can continue to follow their faith when they run a family business ... Now is the time to redouble our efforts to build a culture that fully respects religious freedom.\\" Pro-choice and civil-liberties groups criticized the ruling. Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said, \\"Today, the Supreme Court ruled against American women and families, giving bosses the right to discriminate against women and deny their employees access to birth control coverage. This is a deeply disappointing and troubling ruling that will prevent some women, especially those working hourly-wage jobs and struggling to make ends meet, from getting birth control.\\" Deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Louise Melling said, \\"This is a deeply troubling decision. For the first time, the highest court in the country has said that business owners can use their religious beliefs to deny their employees a benefit that they are guaranteed by law.\\" In an editorial, the New England Journal of Medicine called the decision \\"a setback for both the ACA's foundational goal of access to universal health care and for women's health care specifically\\", voicing concern that \\"in assessing the competing claims about abortion and birth control, the Court's majority focused on the religious claims of the corporations without discussing scientific or medical opinions.\\" In JAMA Internal Medicine, Alta Charo wrote that \\"consistent with a disturbing trend among courts and legislatures to misstate or misuse scientific information in the context of women's reproductive rights and health, the Supreme Court's decision ignored the well-accepted distinction between contraception and abortion.\\" The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, representing 90% of U.S. board-certified gynecologists, supported a bill to overturn the Hobby Lobby ruling. =Government= White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, \\"Congress needs to take action to solve this problem that's been created and the administration stands ready to work with them to do so. President Obama believes that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their bosses deciding for them. Today's decision jeopardizes the health of women that are employed by these companies.\\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said, \\"If the Supreme Court will not protect women's access to health care, then Democrats will. We will continue to fight to preserve women's access to contraceptive coverage and keep bosses out of the examination room.\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, \\"[T]he Obama administration cannot trample on the religious freedoms that Americans hold dear.\\" Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), who introduced the RFRA in 1993, said his law \\"was not intended to extend the same protection to for- profit corporations, whose very purpose is to profit from the open market.\\" Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) said, \\"The mandate overturned today would have required for-profit companies to choose between violating their constitutionally-protected faith or paying crippling fines, which would have forced them to lay off employees or close their doors.\\" House minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, \\"Although the Court restricted their ruling to 'closely held' companies, this ruling will immediately affect the lives of millions of women across the country. Over 90 percent of America's businesses are 'closely held', including such large employers as Koch Industries and Bechtel. Women should not be forced to jump through extra hoops to secure the fundamental health care they need. Allowing employers and CEOs to limit the health care available to employees is a gross violation of their workers' religious rights. It's just not her boss' business.\\" Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said, \\"Today's victory in the Hobby Lobby case is terrific news‚Äîbut now is no time to rest. We cannot rely on the courts alone to defend our religious liberty.\\" Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said, \\"I applaud the Supreme Court's decision to protect the religious freedom of all Americans, both individually and collectively. The notion that religious freedom belongs only to some, and even then only in private, defies our nation's traditions, our laws, and our Constitution. And as the Supreme Court rightfully said today, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could not have been clearer in saying religious liberty of all Americans must be equally protected and not unnecessarily burdened.\\" Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn) said, \\"I am extremely encouraged by today's Supreme Court decision to uphold the religious liberty rights of the Green family of Hobby Lobby.\\" Aftermath =Cases following SCOTUS ruling= Forbes reported that following the ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, \\"the Supreme Court vacated the judgment against Eden Foods and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for further consideration.\\" On November 6, 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States decided it will hear arguments for the case of Zubik v. Burwell combined with six other challenges‚Äîincluding Priests for Life v. Burwell, Southern Nazarene University v. Burwell, Geneva College v. Burwell, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Burwell, East Texas Baptist University v. Burwell, Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell‚Äîto the contraceptive mandate of Obamacare. =Wheaton College order= On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a temporary exemption to the approach it suggested as a less restrictive alternative in Hobby Lobby, where the plaintiffs would send a form (EBSA Form 700) to its insurance issuer, which would pay for the contraception. In an unsigned emergency injunction for Wheaton College in Illinois, the court said that instead of notifying its insurance issuer, Wheaton can notify the government. Once notified, the government should notify the issuer. Wheaton believed that by transferring the obligation to cover contraceptives to its insurance issuer, it was triggering that obligation. The emergency injunction does not constitute a ruling on the merits of Wheaton's religious objection. The court said \\"Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicant's employees and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.\\"Order in Pending Case, Wheaton College v. Bruwell, On Application for Injunction, July 3, 2014 In a 15-page dissent joined by the other two women on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority's reasoning: \\"Wheaton's application comes nowhere near the high bar necessary to warrant an emergency injunction from this court ... The court's actions in this case create unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth: The government must be allowed to handle the basic tasks of public administration in a manner that comports with common sense.\\" The Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor granted a similar temporary injunction to the Little Sisters of the Poor at the end of 2013, just before the mandate was to go into effect. In dueling commentaries between regular SCOTUSblog contributor Marty Lederman and co-founder Tom Goldstein, Lederman argued that only Form 700 can require an insurance provider to pay for contraception coverage. Goldstein argued that an existing regulation allows the government to specify an alternative to Form 700. He pointed out that \\"the Court didn't accept Wheaton's most aggressive argument\\" that it cannot be required to do anything. He said that Justice Kennedy's concurrence is controlling and makes clear that the RFRA is not violated by requiring Wheaton to notify the government. A revised version of EBSA Form 700, effective August 2014, says \\"[a]s an alternative to using this form, an eligible organization may provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the eligible organization has a religious objection to providing coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services ...\\".  Implications  =Religious exemption from laws that apply to the general public= Although the court stated clearly that the decision is limited to the contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p. 4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor general said, \\"for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else.\\" Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care. In line with the dissenting opinion, The American Prospect asked, \\"[W]ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that minimum wage laws violate their religious beliefs?\\" Jonathan Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLT) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights withdrew their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the Hobby Lobby ruling. NGLT executive director Rea Carey said, \\"We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years.\\" Such concerns are focused on the court's application of the federal RFRA law and were driven by national controversy over a state RFRA amendment bill in Arizona. Douglas Laycock, law professor at the University of Virginia, said, \\"The whole secular left has decided\\" that RFRA laws \\"are very dangerous because they care so much more about the contraception cases and gay rights.\\" He said RFRA laws are mischaracterized because they do not dictate outcomes favoring religious objectors, they only require courts to use the highest standard of scrutiny on any law challenged. Mark Kernes, Senior Editor and Chief Legal Analyst for AVN magazine stated in an op-ed piece, \\"If the Hobby Lobby decision supports the 'right' of companies not to make available birth control that will prevent women from 'catching' a pregnancy, what's to keep those same religious companies from arguing that providing access to PrEP drugs like Truvada, which help prevent gays (and, admittedly, everyone) from catching HIV shouldn't similarly be excluded from their health plans?\\" =Imposition of religious beliefs onto others= Marcia Greenberger, co- president of the National Women's Law Center, said that the Supreme Court has never ruled that companies have religious beliefs and that \\"it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties.\\" Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom \\"gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give you the right to impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others.\\" The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision \\"swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees.\\" A Fox News columnist wrote, \\"..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon.\\" The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, said that the ruling \\"may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees.\\" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \\"It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees.\\" The Center for American Progress said that the ruling \\"moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood‚Äîreally treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees.\\" Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, \\"The First Amendment is at its best when it is used to protect the rights of minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom.\\" Scholars on the other side (including some on the left) disagree, arguing that companies owned and run by liberals will likewise benefit from the freedom to operate according to their conscience or values‚Äîwhich has not been viewed as \\"imposing\\" views, because people routinely choose whom to associate with based on philosophical compatibility. =Corporate liability= The New York Times editor Dorothy J. Samuels invoked the cautionary adage \\"be careful what you wish for\\", speculating that \\"if owners indicate that they are not entirely separate from their corporation‚Äîby denying corporation employees' birth control coverage based on their personal religious beliefs‚Äîthe case could be made in future state-court litigation that they have waived their right to be shielded from responsibility for corporate financial liabilities.\\" The dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, Erwin Chemerinsky, said, \\"The liabilities of the corporation are not attributed to the owners, so why should the owners be able to attribute their beliefs to the company?\\" Several legal scholars wrote an amicus brief to the Supreme Court for this case arguing this danger, while scholars on the other side counter that incorporated non-profit organizations enjoy liability protection despite their activities based on religious or other values/conscience-based causes.

From 1990, she danced with the Paris Opera Ballet where she rose to the top rank of √©toile in 2009. Since retiring from the stage in February 2014, she has devoted most of her time to teaching. Early life Born in Ajaccio on March 12, 1972, to Christian and Paulette Ciaravola, she began ballet classes as a child in her native Corsica before she was identified at the age of 13 as having exceptional promise while on a course in continental France. As a result, she studied under Christiane Vaussard at the Conservatoire de Paris, winning the First Prize in 1988 at the age of 16. She joined the Paris Opera Ballet School, where she graduated two years later. Career Ciaravola became a member of the Paris Opera Ballet in 1990, only the second Corsican to do so, after Marie-Claude Pietragalla. It was quite some time before her talents were fully recognized. Only in 2003 did she become a premi√®re danseuse which allowed her to dance as a leading soloist, with opportunities for deciding which works she wanted to pursue. Among her preferences were Roland Petit's Clavigo, John Neumeier's Lady of the Camellias and Troisi√®me Symphonie de Gustav Mahler, and Kenneth MacMillan's L'Histoire de Manon. In addition to roles in the classical works, since 2004 she danced the leads in Patrice Bart's La Petite danseuse de Degas, George Balanchine's Emeraudes/Joyaux, Serenade, Liebeslieder Walzer and The Four Temperaments and as Nikiya in Rudolf Nureyev's La Bayad√®re. In 2009, after the first performance of John Cranko's, Oneguin, Ciaravola and her dance partner, Mathias Heymann, were promoted to √©toile. She taught at the Ballet Masterclasses in Prague. Future plans Ciaravola had ankle surgery in 2010. After being a member of the Paris ballet for 24 years, she retired from the stage in February 2014 receiving a thirty-minute standing ovation. She hoped to contribute her wide experience and repertoire by teaching new entrants to the profession. She is now associated with the Prix Isabella Ciaravola which is designed to provide encouragement to young ballet dancers.

It was based on the eponymous children's book published in 1980 which for many years was regarded as a classic of children's literature in Brazil, getting spun off into movies, plays and TV series.Portal Educacional ‚Äî \\"Biografia detalhada\\" The comic books were published by Abril and Globo from 1989 until 2007. It was Ziraldo's second series of comic books, after \\"Turma do Perer√™\\". The main character, \\"Maluquinho\\" is a cheerful and optimistic 10-year-old boy who wears a pan on his head like a hat. (his trademark) Most of the stories revolve around the misadventures of Maluquinho and his friends with a light humour.  Characters  * Maluquinho (literally Nutty) - The main character, an eccentric and smart boy, mischievous and troublemaking but good-hearted. He is always close to his friends Boc√£o and Junim, and is popular with girls (it is said in the book that he has 10 girlfriends, all at once), mainly Julieta. He often wears a cooking pot on his head as an improvised Napoleon's hat, an adult-sized blue jacket and brown dress shoes, both pieces looking quite oversized on him. Aside from that, his main attire is a yellow T-shirt, black shorts and white and sky blue sneakers. * Julieta - Maluquinho's girlfriend. She's also a 10-year-old girl, sometimes considered a female version as \\"Menina Maluquinha\\" (\\"The Nutty Girl\\"). Julieta is cheerful, energetic, and talkative. She has a blue pet cat named Romeu (a reference to the Shakespearean tragedy Romeo and Juliet). She had her own comic that was released in 2004. She has long, black, frizzy hair, wears a red T-shirt with a lightning bolt design (very similar to Captain Marvel's symbol), pleated white skirt and red and white sneakers. * Boc√£o (literally Gobber or Big Mouth) - Maluquinho's best friend, a chubby and glutton boy which often is always beside of Maluquinho in most of his plans and jokes. Usually he is ingenuous and is induced to the conversations of his friends. He has a little sister named Nina, that usually annoys him. He is a bit taller than the others and dresses all in blue. * Junim (a corruption of Juninho, in turn an affectionate form of Junior) - Another of the Maluquinho' best friends, short in stature and with thick-rimmed glasses. Often gets stressed when his friends make fun of his little size. Like Maluquinho and Julieta, he also had his own comic that was released in 2007. Has blond hair which stands upright, wears a black-and-red striped shirt, blue pants and tennis shoes. * Carolina \\"Carol\\" - A Julieta's best friend. She is a vegetarian who cares about nature. She has black hair done in braided pigtails and wears a green dress. * Herman - A bully and Maluquinho's rival. He is a tall strong boy who is jealous of Maluquinho for always being the center of attention and often threatens to beat him. Has strawberry blond hair and wears mainly a blue sweater with jogging pants in the same color. * L√∫cio - A friend of Maluquinho. He is the most intellectual kid in the class, always with a book in his hands. He is an African-Brazilian boy, usually wears a plaid shirt in the black and yellow colors. * Sugiro Fernando - Another friend of Maluquinho. He is a Japanese-Brazilian boy who loves technology, computers and video games. He is usually seen with closed eyes, wears a red shirt and white pants, and has a buckteeth. * Shirley Val√©ria - Julieta's frenemy. A rich girl who is always obsessed with fashion and fitness and always buy new clothes to attract the boys. She is blonde and is the only character to have blue eyes, usually wears a pink sleeveless shirt, blue gym pants, pink legwarmers and white-pink sneakers. Also she is the only female character to have developing breasts, indicating she is entering her teenageyears.  Titles  The first time a comic was published was in 1989, initially under the title of \\"O Menino Maluquinho em Quadrinhos\\" (The Nutty Boy in Comics). In the last years of publication they have been sold titles starring Julieta and Junim. There were a total of 162 comic books have been published over the years. ;Editora Abril * O Menino Maluquinho (1989-1994) - 70 issues * Revista do Menino Maluquinho (1994-1996) - 18 issues ;Editora Terra * O Menino Maluquinho (2000-2001) - 10 issues ;Editora Globo * O Menino Maluquinho (2004-2007) - 29 issues * Julieta (2004-2007) - 29 issues * Junim (2007) - 6 issues  Adaptations  = Films = In 1995 ' was released, directed by Helv√©cio Ratton, with a cast of Samuel Costa, Roberto Bomtempo, Patr√≠cia Pillar, Othon Bastos and Lu√≠s Carlos Arutin (in his final film role). The movie follows Maluquinho's life with his friends and their pranks, dealing with his parents divorce and his relationship with his grandfather, that is a retired aviator who lives on a farm and dies at the end of the film. The film had a sequel in 1997 titled ', directed by Fernando Meirelles, with the same cast as the first film. In this movie Maluquinho tells his friends a story of another trip to his grandfather's house, where they discover a creature of fire called Tat√° and become her friends. In 2019 it was announced the production of an animated film based on the character by the studio Chatrone in partnership with Netflix. = TV series = In 2006 the channel TVE Brasil (currently TV Brasil) produced a live-action sitcom called Um Menino Muito Maluquinho. This was the channel's second adaptation of Ziraldo's comics, following '. The series, usually narrated by an adult, follows the life of Maluquinho and his friends, alternating between their early childhood (up to age 5) and his current age of 10. The show became popular, winning several awards and being broadcast on other channels‚Äî TV Cultura and Disney Channel‚Äî but did not have a second season. In 2014 the production of animated series based on the character was announced.  Other books  With the success of the comics, other books based on the character were written by Ziraldo over the years. These books started to use the characters created in the comics, such as Julieta, Boc√£o and Junim. Some of the published books were: *O Livro do Riso do Menino Maluquinho (November 20, 2000) *O Livro das M√°gicas do Menino Maluquinho (2000) *A Panela do Menino Maluquinho (November 2007) *O Livro do Sim and O Livro do N√£o (April 30, 2009) *O Livro de Receitas do Menino Maluquinho (July 23, 2014) *Os Hai-Kais do Menino Maluquinho (2012) *O Livro dos Jogos, Brincadeiras e Bagun√ßas do Menino Maluquinho (2014) *Eu, Eu, Eu e o Mar (August 2018) - Adaptation of one of the episodes of the TV series. *O Pior Amigo (August 2018) - Also a adaptation of one of the episodes of the TV series. In 1996 Ziraldo also created a series of spin-off book series with the characters as babies entitled Beb√™ Maluquinho (Nutty Baby). Julieta's success in the comics published by Globo resulted in a book focused on the character entitled Uma Menina Chamada Julieta (A Girl Called Julieta) published in 2009.https://noticias.bol.uol.com.br/entretenimento/2009/12/04/ult4738u30581.jhtm = Crossover with Monica's Gang = In 2018, a book entitled MMMMM: M√¥nica e Menino Maluquinho na Montanha M√°gica (Monica and Nutty Boy in the Magic Mountain), written by Manuel Filho with illustrations made by both Mauricio de Sousa and Ziraldo.https://cultura.estadao.com.br/noticias/literatura,ziraldo- e-mauricio-de-sousa-lancam-crossover-de-monica-e-menino- maluquinho,70002429672https://g1.globo.com/pop- arte/noticia/2018/08/04/ziraldo-e-mauricio-de-sousa-lancam-juntos-na-bienal-o- livro-monica-e-menino-maluquinho-na-montanha- magica.ghtmlhttps://paginacinco.blogosfera.uol.com.br/2018/07/25/hq-mauricio- de-sousa-ziraldo-capa-monica-maluquinho/ The book marks the first official crossover between O Menino Maluquinho and Monica's Gang, two of the most popular comic book franchises in Brazil.

Artist generated view of Opportunity, in a real image taken by said rover of a crater Selfie looking down on its panels, December 2004 Opportunity is a robotic rover that was active on the planet Mars from 2004 to 2018. Launched on July 7, 2003, Opportunity landed on Mars' Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004 at 05:05 Ground UTC (about 13:15 Mars local time), three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A), also part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission, touched down on the other side of the planet.\\"Spirit\\" landed on January 4, 2004. While Spirit became immobile in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, Opportunity exceeded its planned 90 sol (Martian days) duration of activity by (in Earth time). Opportunity continued to move, gather scientific observations, and report back to Earth until 2018. What follows is a summary of events during its continuing mission. Opportunity started in Eagle crater in 2004, literally landing inside on the crater basin, then it travelled outward making its way to Endurance crater. After this it went to Victoria crater, all the way making many panoramas, measurements, studying rocks and smaller craters, even what are thought to be meteorites. It then traveled to Endeavour crater, where it has been making its way south along the Western rim. On June 10, 2018 contact was lost when a global dust storm blotted out the Sun, thus depriving the rover of enough power for operations and communication with Earth. In September 2018, after the storm subsided, NASA began making various efforts to contact and listen to the rover if it endured the storm. NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was complete on February 13, 2019 after it failed to wake from over 1,000 repeated signals sent since August 2018.

First color panorama taken by Opportunity, showing the Martian landscape at Meridiani Planum, shortly after it touched down in 2004 Opportunity landed in Meridiani Planum at , about downrange (east) of its intended target on January 25, 2004 at 05:05. Although Meridiani is a flat plain, without the rock fields seen at previous Mars landing sites, Opportunity rolled into an impact crater 22 meters in diameter, with the rim of the crater approximately from the rover. NASA Scientists were so excited about landing in a crater that they called the landing a \\"hole in one\\"; however, they were not aiming for the crater (and did not know it existed). Later, the crater was named Eagle crater and the landing site designated \\"Challenger Memorial Station\\". This was the darkest landing site ever visited by a spacecraft on Mars. It would be two weeks before Opportunity was able to get a better look at its surroundings. Scientists were intrigued by the abundance of rock outcrops dispersed throughout the crater, as well as the crater's soil, which appeared to be a mixture of coarse gray grains and fine reddish grains. This sweeping look at the unusual rock outcropping near Opportunity was captured by the rover's panoramic camera. Scientists believe the seemingly layered rocks are either volcanic ash deposits or sediments laid down by wind or water. It was given the name Opportunity Ledge. Geologists said that the layers‚Äîsome no thicker than a finger‚Äîindicate the rocks likely originated either from sediments carried by water or wind, or from falling volcanic ash. \\"We should be able to distinguish between those two hypotheses\\", said Dr. Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, Cambridge, a member of the science team for Opportunity and its twin, Spirit. If the rocks are sedimentary, water is a more likely source than wind, he said. These layered rocks measure only tall and are thought to be either volcanic ash deposits or sediments carried by water or wind. The layers are very thin measuring just a few millimeters thick in some cases. Mars Global Surveyor orbiter's photograph of landing site showing \\"hole in one.\\" (See also: simulation of Opportunity trajectory on arrival at Mars in January 2004).  \\"Opportunity Ledge\\" outcroppings  On Sol 15, Opportunity took a close up of the rock \\"Stone Mountain\\" in the outcrop area of the crater, raising speculation that the rock consisted of very fine grain or dust, in contrast to Earth sandstone, which is compacted sand with rather large grains. The weathering agent eroding away layers of this rock seemed to be visible as dark spots. A picture received on February 10 (taken on Sol 16) showed that the thin layers in the bedrock converge and diverge at low angles, suggesting that some \\"moving current\\" such as volcanic flow, wind, or water formed these rocks. The discovery of these layers was significant for scientists who had planned this mission to test the \\"water hypothesis\\" rigorously.  El Capitan outcropping  Section of El Capitan. On February 19 the survey of \\"Opportunity Ledge\\" was declared successful. A specific target in the outcrop (dubbed \\"El Capitan\\"), whose upper and lower portions appeared to differ in layering and weathering characteristics, was selected for further investigation. El Capitan, about high, was named after a mountain in Texas. Opportunity reached El Capitan on Sol 27, and took a first picture of the rocks with its panoramic camera. On Sol 30, Opportunity used its Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) for the first time to investigate the rocks around El Capitan. The image on the right-hand side shows a close-up view taken after the drilling and cleaning process was complete. Due to chance, two spherules were also cut partially, and seem to show scratches and other marks made by the diamond-crusted grind tool. The black areas are artifacts of the imaging process, when parts of the picture are missing. During a press conference on March 2, 2004, mission scientists discussed their conclusions about the bedrock and the evidence for the presence of liquid water during their formation. They presented the following reasoning to explain the small, elongated voids in the rock visible on the surface and after grinding into it (see last two images below). These voids are consistent with features known to geologists as \\"vugs\\". These are formed when crystals form inside a rock matrix and are later removed through erosive processes, leaving behind voids. Some of the features in this picture are \\"disk-like\\", which is consistent with certain types of crystals, notably sulfate minerals. Additionally, mission members presented first data from the MIMOS II M√∂ssbauer spectrometer taken at the bedrock site. The iron spectrum obtained from the rock El Capitan shows strong evidence for the mineral jarosite. This mineral contains hydroxide ions, which indicates the presence of water when the minerals were formed. Mini-TES data from the same rock showed that it consists of a considerable amount of sulfates. Image:Opportunity photo of Mars outcrop rock.jpgClose up of a rock outcrop.

Analyzing soil through digging a trench  This image, taken by the microscopic imager, reveals shiny, spherical objects embedded within the trench wall In order to analyze the soil inside the crater it was decided to try to dig a trench with the wheels. The rover alternately pushed soil forward and backward out of the trench with its right front wheel while other wheels held the rover in place. The rover turned slightly between bouts of digging to widen the hole. The process lasted 22 minutes. The resulting trench ‚Äî the first dug by either Mars Exploration Rover ‚Äî is about long and deep. Two features that caught scientists' attention were the clotty texture of soil in the upper wall of the trench and the brightness of soil on the trench floor. By inspecting the sides and floor of a hole it dug, Opportunity found some things it had not imaged beforehand, including shiny round pebbles and soil so fine-grained that the rover's microscope could not make out individual particles. What is underneath is different from what is at the immediate surface. The soils consist of fine-grained basaltic sand and a surface lag of hematite-rich spherules, spherule fragments, and other granules. Underlying the thin soil layer, are flat-lying sedimentary rocks. These rocks are finely laminated, are rich in sulfur, and contain abundant sulfate salts.S. Squyres, et al., \\"The Opportunity Rover's Athena Science Investigation At Meridiani Planum, Mars,\\" Science, Vol. 306, Issue 5702, 1698‚Äì1703 (December 3, 2004). Mapping out of various aspects of Opportunitys mission up to April 2004 as seen from orbit  Endurance crater  On sol April 20, 2004, the rover reached Endurance crater, which was known to have many layers of rocks. In May the rover circumnavigated the crater, and made observations with Mini-TES and the panoramic camera. The rock \\"Lion Stone\\" was investigated on Sol 107 and found to be similar in composition to the layers found in Eagle crater. On sol June 4, 2004 mission members announced their intention to drive Opportunity into Endurance, even if it should turn out to be impossible to get back out, targeting the various rock layers that were identified in the pictures from the crater rim. \\"This is a crucial and careful decision for the Mars Exploration Rovers' extended mission\\", said Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science. Steve Squyres, principal investigator from Cornell University said: \\"Answering the question of what came before the evaporites is the most significant scientific issue we can address with Opportunity at this time.\\" The view of Burns Cliff inside Endurance Crater. A first drive into the crater was executed on sol June 8, and Opportunity backed out again the same day. It was found that the angle of the surface was well inside the safety margin (about 18 degrees), and the full excursion toward the rock layer of interest was started. During Sols 134 (June 12), 135, and 137 the rover drove deeper and deeper into the crater. Although some wheel slip was observed, driving was discovered to be possible even at slope angles up to 30 degrees. Wispy clouds, similar to Earth's cirrus clouds, were spotted. Opportunity spent roughly 180 sols inside the crater, before backing out of it again in mid December 2004, on Sol 315. Scientific results of the sedimentary geology of the crater were published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters In December 2004, daily power output varied from 840 watt-hours while inside Endurance Crater to 730 watt-hours on the plains. = 2005 =  Heat Shield Rock and stuck in sand  Traverse map released July 2005, from about Sol 405 to Sol 528 After exiting Endurance crater, in January 2005 Opportunity was driven to examine its own discarded heat shield. While in the vicinity of the heat shield, on Sol 345 it came upon an object that was immediately suspected and soon confirmed to be a meteorite. The meteorite was promptly named Heat Shield Rock, and is the first meteorite identified on another planet (although the Bench Crater and Hadley Rille meteorites were found earlier on the Moon). After about 25 sols of observations Opportunity headed south for a crater named Argo, nearly from the heat shield. The rover was commanded to dig another trench on the vast plains of Meridiani Planum, on Sol 366, and observations continued until Sol 373 (February 10, 2005). The rover then passed the craters \\"Alvin\\" and \\"Jason\\", and by Sol 387, approached a \\"crater triplet\\" on its way to Vostok Crater. Along the way, Opportunity set a distance record for one-day travel by either rover: , on sol February 19, 2005. On Sol (February 26, 2005), the rover approached one of the three craters, dubbed Naturaliste. A rock target named \\"Normandy\\" was chosen for investigation on Sol 392, and Opportunity remained there until Sol 395. Opportunity reached Vostok Crater on Sol 399, finding it mostly filled with sand and lined by outcrops. It was then ordered south into what has been called \\"etched terrain\\", to search for more bedrock. On March 20, 2005 (Sol 410) Opportunity set a new Martian record for the longest single day drive when it drove . By Sol 415, Opportunity stopped by some soil ripples to investigate the differences between soil in the trough of a ripple and its crest. Various soil targets included \\"Mobarak\\" in the trough, named in honor of Persian New Year, and \\"Norooz\\" and \\"Mayberooz\\" on the crest. By Sol 421, the rover left the ripple for \\"Viking\\" crater. Between April 26, 2005 (Sol 446) and June 4, 2005 (Sol 484) Opportunity was stuck in a Martian sand dune. The problem began on sol (April 26, 2005) when Opportunity inadvertently dug itself into a sand dune: Mission scientists reported that images indicated all four corner wheels were dug in by more than a wheel radius, just as the rover attempted to climb over a dune about tall. The sand dune was designated \\"Purgatory Dune\\" by mission planners. The rover's condition was simulated on Earth prior to any attempt to move, out of concern that the rover might become permanently immobilized. After various simulations intended to mimic the properties and behavior of Martian sand were completed, the rover executed its first wheel movements on sol (May 13, 2005), intentionally advancing only a few centimeters, after which mission members evaluated the results. During Sol 465 and 466 more drive commands were executed, and with each trial the rover moved another couple of centimeters. At the end of each movement, panoramic images were acquired to investigate the atmosphere and the surrounding dune field. The sand dune escape maneuver was successfully completed on sol (June 4, 2005), and all six wheels of Opportunity were on firmer ground. After studying \\"Purgatory\\" from Sol 498 to Sol 510, Opportunity proceeded southward toward \\"Erebus crater\\".  Erebus crater  Opportunity studied Erebus crater, a large, shallow, partially buried crater and a stopover on the way south toward Victoria crater, between October 2005 and March 2006. New programming to measure the percentage of slip in the wheels was successful in preventing the rover from getting stuck again. Another \\"Purgatory\\"-like incident was averted on Sol 603, when onboard slip check software stopped a drive after slip reached 44.5%. It proceeded over many ripples and 'half- pipes', taking photographs after each sol's journey. On Sol (November 3, 2005) Opportunity woke up in the midst of a mild dust storm that lasted three days. The rover was able to drive in self-protective auto-mode during the storm, but it could not take any post-drive images. Less than three weeks later, another cleaning event cleared the dust off of the solar array so as to produce around 720 watt-hours (80% of max). On Sol (December 1, 2005), it was discovered the motor used to stow the robotic arm for travel was stalling. This problem took nearly two weeks to fix. Initially, the arm was stowed only for travel and was extended at night to prevent the arm from getting stuck. However further stalling convinced engineers to leave the arm extended at all times to avoid the arm becoming stuck in the stowed position and becoming unusable. Opportunity observed numerous outcroppings around Erebus crater. It also collaborated with ESA's Mars Express by using the miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer and panoramic camera (Pancam), and took images of a transit across the Sun by Phobos. On Sol (March 22, 2006), Opportunity began the journey to its next destination, Victoria crater, which it would reach in September 2006 (Sol 951). It would stay at Victoria crater until August 2008 (Sol 1630‚Äì1634).  Shoulder troubles  The \\"shoulder\\" joint of Opportunitys arm has had troubles since Sol 2 (January 25, 2004), the rover's second day on Mars. Engineers discovered that the heater on the shoulder azimuth joint, which controls side-to-side motion of the robotic arm, was stuck in the \\"on\\" position. Closer investigation revealed that the on-off switch had probably failed during assembly, test, and launch operations on Earth. Fortunately for Opportunity, the rover was equipped with a built-in safety mechanism called a \\"T-stat box\\" (thermostatic switch) that provided protection against overheating. When the shoulder azimuth joint, also known as Joint 1, got too hot, the T-stat switch automatically opened and temporarily disabled the heater. When the joint got cold again, the T-stat closed. As a result, the heater stayed on all night but not all day. Opportunity extends its arm to analyze Heat Shield Rock on Sol 349 (early 2005). The safety mechanism worked until Opportunity approached the first winter on Mars. As the Sun began to retreat lower in the sky and solar power levels dropped, it became clear that Opportunity would not be able to keep the batteries charged with a heater draining power all night long. On Sol (May 28, 2004), rover operators began using a procedure known as \\"deep sleep,\\" during which Opportunity disconnected the batteries at night. Deep sleep prevented the stuck heater (and everything else on the rover except the clock and the battery heaters) from drawing power. When the Sun came up the next morning and sunlight began hitting the solar arrays, the batteries automatically reconnected, the robotic arm became operational, the shoulder joint warmed up, and the thermostatic switch opened, disabling the heater. As a result, the shoulder joint was extremely hot during the day and extremely cold at night. Such huge temperature swings, which tend to make electric motors wear out faster, were taking place every sol. This strategy worked for Opportunity until Sol 654 (November 25, 2005), when the Joint-1 azimuth motor stalled because of increased electrical resistance. Rover operators responded by delivering higher-than-normal current to the motor. This approach also worked, though Joint 1 continued to stall periodically. Typically, the rover's handlers simply tried again the next sol and the joint worked. They determined that the Joint-1 motor stalls were most likely due to damage caused by the extreme temperature cycles the joint experienced during deep sleep. As a precaution, they started keeping the robotic arm out in front of the rover overnight, rather than stowing it underneath the rover deck, where it would be virtually unusable in the event of a Joint-1 motor failure. They stowed the arm only while driving and unstowed it immediately at the end of each drive. = 2006 =  Journey to Victoria crater  On March 22, 2006 (Sol 760), Opportunity left Erebus crater and began the journey to Victoria crater, which it reached in September 2006 (Sol 951). It would stay at Victoria crater until August 2008 (Sol 1630‚Äì1634). The rover's journey up to Sol 878 (July 2006) on the way to Victoria crater  Arrival at Victoria crater  Victoria crater is a massive impact crater approximately from the original landing site. Victoria's diameter is six times larger than Endurance crater. Scientists believed that rock outcrops along the walls of Victoria would yield more information about the geologic history of Mars, if the rover survived long enough to investigate them. On Sol (September 26, 2006) Opportunity reached the rim of Victoria Crater and transmitted the first substantial views of Victoria, including the dune field at the bottom of the crater. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed Opportunity at the rim of the crater. = 2007 =  Moving around Victoria's rim  On January 4, 2007, both rovers received new flight software for their computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether to transmit an image, and whether to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists, as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks. The APXS instrument was now for the first time used to determine the amount of the noble gas argon in the atmosphere of Mars. The same measurements were done on the other side of the planet by its rover twin Spirit. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the atmospheric mixing processes and track their changes with time. In January the rover drove along the north side of the crater rim and imaged the cliffs from different viewpoints. While driving another meteorite was found: Santa Caterina. In March the Valley without peril was reached. This point had thought to be a possible entry point into the crater. But it turned out that this point had a too steep slope to drive carefully downside. After two additional cliffs where inspected it was decided to drive the whole way back to the point, where Opportunity arrived at Victoria crater. On June 15, 2007 the rover arrived at Duck Bay and prepared for entering the crater. A series of cleaning events beginning on Sol (April 20, 2007) allowed Opportunitys solar energy production to rise to above 800 watt-hours per Sol. By Sol (May 4, 2007) the solar array current was peaking above 4.0 amperes, values not seen since Sol (February 10, 2004). However, the advent of extensive dust storms on Mars starting in mid-2007 (in-line with Mars' six Earth-year global dust storm cycle), dropped energy production levels to 280 watt-hours per day.  Dust storms  Time-lapse composite of the Martian horizon during Sols 1205 (0.94), 1220 (2.9), 1225 (4.1), 1233 (3.8), 1235 (4.7) shows how much sunlight the dust storms blocked; Tau of 4.7 indicates 99% blocked. credit:NASA/JPL-Caltech/Cornell. Toward the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both Opportunity and Spirit were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of power. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \\"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\\". The key problem caused by the dust storm was a dramatic reduction in solar power. There was so much dust in the atmosphere that it blocked 99 percent of direct sunlight to the rover. The Spirit rover, on the other side of the planet, was getting slightly more sunlight than Opportunity. Normally the solar arrays are able to generate about 700 watt-hours of energy per day. During the storms, the power generated is greatly reduced. If the rovers get less than 150 watt-hours per day they have to start draining their batteries. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. On July 18, 2007, the rover's solar-panel only generated 128 watt-hours, the lowest level ever. NASA responded by commanding Opportunity to only communicate with Earth once every three days, the first time that this had happened since the start of the mission. The dust storms continued through July and at the end of the month, NASA announced that the rovers, even under their very-low-power mode were barely getting enough energy to survive. If the temperature of the Opportunitys electronics module continued to drop, according to the announcement, \\"there is a real risk that Opportunity will trip a low-power fault. When a low-power fault is tripped, the rover's systems take the batteries off-line, putting the rover to sleep and then checking each sol to see if there is sufficient available energy to wake up and perform daily fault communications. If there is not sufficient energy, Opportunity will stay asleep. Depending on the weather conditions, Opportunity could stay asleep for days, weeks or even months, all the while trying to charge its batteries with whatever available sunlight there might be.\\" It was quite possible that the rover would never wake up from a low-power fault. By sol August 7, 2007 the storms appeared to be weakening, and although power levels were still low they were sufficient for Opportunity to begin taking and returning images. By August 21 dust levels were still improving, the batteries were fully charged and Opportunity was able to make its first drive since the dust storms began. Opportunity made a short drive into Duck Bay on sol September 11, 2007 and then reversed out again to test traction on the initial slope into Victoria Crater. On sol September 13, 2007 it returned to begin a more thorough exploration of the inner slope, examining a series of layers of pale-coloured rock in the upper parts of Duck Bay and the face of the promontory Cape Verde in detail.

The white dots are places where rover stopped to perform scientific observations or turned (6/2007). = 2008 = Rover daily power output averaged 580 watt-hours in the first days of 2008, with atmospheric opacity (tau) caused by dust at about 0.71, and solar array dust factor averaging 0.787.  Inspecting Victoria crater  On Sol 1502 (April 15, 2008) the motor stalled at the beginning of an unstowing operation at the end of a drive, when the arm was still tucked underneath the rover. The motor continued to stall on all subsequent attempts, sol after sol. Engineers performed tests at various times of day to measure electrical resistance. They found that the resistance was lowest (essentially normal) when the joint was at its warmest‚Äîin the morning, following deep sleep, after the heater had been on for several hours, and just before the T-stat opened. They decided to try to unstow the arm one more time under these conditions. At 08:30 local Mars time on Sol (May 14, 2008), they allowed Opportunity to direct as much current as possible to the warm, joint-1 azimuth motor in order to get the robotic arm into a usable position, in front of the rover. It worked. Because Opportunity will likely never again stow the robotic arm, engineers devised a strategy for driving the rover safely with the arm deployed in front.  Departing Victoria crater  Departing Victoria crater The rover exited Victoria crater's Duck Bay on August 24‚Äì28, 2008 (sol 1630‚Äì1634). Before exiting the crater the rover experienced a current spike similar to the one that preceded the malfunction of the right front wheel of its twin Spirit. After Victoria crater and during its journey to Endeavour crater the rover investigated sets of \\"dark cobbles\\" on the Meridiani plains. Endeavour is in diameter and is south-east of Victoria. Rover drivers estimated that this distance could be traversed in about two years. Scientists expected to see a much deeper stack of rock layers at the crater than those examined by Opportunity in Victoria. The discovery of phyllosilicate clay- bearing rock on the Endeavour crater rim promised exposure to a rock-type that is even more hospitable to life than types previously analyzed. The solar conjunction, where the Sun is between Earth and Mars, started on sol November 29, 2008 and communication with the rovers was not possible until December 13, 2008. During this time the rover team planned to have Opportunity use the M√∂ssbauer spectrometer to examine a rock outcrop named \\"Santorini\\". = 2009 =  Driving through Meridiani plains  On sol (March 7, 2009) Opportunity first saw the rim of Endeavour after driving about since it left Victoria in August 2008. Opportunity also saw Iazu crater that was about away and is about in diameter. On sol (April 7, 2009) Opportunity generated 515 watt-hours after a cleaning event of the solar arrays increased energy production by about 40%. From April 16 to 22 (sol 1859 to 1865) Opportunity made a series of drives and during that week traveled a total distance of . The drive actuator for the right front wheel, which had been rested while Opportunity studied a rock outcrop called \\"Penrhyn\\", had motor currents very close to normal levels.  More meteorite findings  On sol (July 18, 2009) a large dark rock was noted in the opposite direction from which Opportunity was traveling and so the rover headed toward it, reaching it on sol (July 28). The rock turned out to be a meteorite and was named Block Island. Opportunity spent until September 12, 2009 (Sol 2004) investigating the meteorite, before returning to its journey toward Endeavour Crater. Its journey was interrupted on Sol 2022 by the find of another meteorite, a specimen dubbed 'Shelter Island', which the rover investigated until Sol 2034. It then headed for another meteorite, 'Mackinac Island', which it reached four sols later on sol (October 17, 2009). The rover conducted a drive-by imaging sequence but otherwise did not investigate this meteorite, resuming its journey to Endeavour. On sol (November 10, 2009) the rover reached a rock target of interest, named 'Marquette Island'. Prolonged study until sol January 12, 2010 ensued, as it was uncertain what type of rock this represented, but the eventual conclusion was that it was rock ejecta from deep within the surface of Mars rather than a meteorite.

In the bottom right is Airy crater, which contains 0, 0 center of the Martian grid On January 28, 2010 (Sol 2138) Opportunity arrived at Concepcion crater. Opportunity successfully circumnavigated the diameter crater before continuing on towards Endeavour. Energy production varied from about 305 watt-hours to about 270 Wh during this period. On sol (May 5, 2010), due to potentially hazardous dune fields along the direct path between Victoria and Endeavour, a new route was charted that extended the distance to travel between the two craters to . On (May 19, 2010), Opportunity reached sols of operation, making it the longest Mars surface mission in history, breaking the record of 2245 sols set by Viking 1. MER-B on Sol 2239 imaged the then distant crater rim Here is the view from the rover's perspective from that location noted in the above top-down view. The white lines in the above view indicate the rover's field of view in this image  Santa Maria crater  In July 2010, it was announced that the Opportunity team would use the theme of names given to places visited by British Royal Navy Captain, Lieutenant James Cook, in his 1769‚Äì1771 Pacific Ocean voyage in command of HMS Endeavour, for informal names of sites at Endeavour Crater. These would include \\"Cape Tribulation\\" and \\"Cape Dromedary\\", \\"Cape Byron\\" (the most easterly point of the Australian mainland), and \\"Point Hicks\\" (the part of the Australian mainland first sighted by the Endeavour in 1770). On sol (September 8, 2010), the halfway point of the journey between Victoria crater and Endeavour crater was reached. In November the rover spent a few days imaging a crater called Intrepid while navigating through a field of small impact craters. On sol November 14, 2010 total odometry passed the mark. Average solar array energy production in October and November was about 600 watt-hours. On sol (December 15, 2010) the rover arrived at Santa Maria and spent several weeks investigating the wide crater. The results from Opportunity were compared to data taken from orbit by the CRISM instrument, a spectrometer, on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. CRISM had detected water- bearing minerals at Santa Maria crater, and the rover helped further analyze this. Opportunity drove farther in that Martian year (that is about 2 Earth years), than in any previous year. =2011= Heading to Endeavour crater A info-graphic showing the traverse from Victoria to Endeavour, in this case highlighting the Sol 2592 After its arrival at the edge of Santa Maria crater, the team positioned the rover at its southeastern rim and collected data. They also prepared for the two-week solar conjunction of late January, when the Sun was between Earth and Mars and communication was blocked. In late March Opportunity began the journey between Santa Maria and Endeavour, and on June 1, the rover passed the traverse milestone (over 50 times its designed distance). Two weeks later, on sol (July 17, 2011), Opportunity had driven on Mars. By sol (August 29, 2011), Opportunity had continued to function effectively 30 times longer than its planned 90-sol mission, aided by solar cell cleaning events, and performed extensive geological analysis of Martian rocks and planetary surface features with its instruments.  Endeavour crater arrival  Opportunity arrives at Endeavour crater Opportunity arrived at Endeavour crater on sol (August 9, 2011), at a landmark called Spirit Point named after its rover twin, after traversing from Victoria crater, over a three-year period. Endeavour is wide and offers scientists new terrain to explore, including older rocks than encountered heretofore, and clay minerals that may have formed in the presence of water. The rover's deputy principal investigator, Ray Arvidson, said it will probably not enter Endeavour crater as it appears to contain material observed previously. The rocks on the rim are older than any previously studied by Opportunity. \\"I think there's much more interest in driving around the perimeter of the rim,\\" said Arvidson. The rover survived so long this goal was accomplished, and by 2016 it was decided to not only enter Endevaour crater but also explore, for the first time in history what is thought to be a water carved gully on Mars (update:2016). Upon arriving at Endeavour, Opportunity almost immediately began discovering Martian phenomena not previously observed. On sol (August 22, 2011) the rover began examining Tisdale 2, a large ejecta block. \\"This is different from any rock ever seen on Mars,\\" said Steve Squyres, principal investigator for Opportunity at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \\"It has a composition similar to some volcanic rocks, but there's much more zinc and bromine than we've typically seen. We are getting confirmation that reaching Endeavour really has given us the equivalent of a second landing site for Opportunity.\\" (See also Cape York (Mars)) In December the Homestake formation was analyzed, which was concluded to be formed of gypsum. Using three of the rover's instruments - the Microscopic Imager, the Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer and the Panoramic Camera's filters - researchers determined the deposit to be hydrated calcium sulfate, or gypsum, a mineral that does not occur except in the presence of water. This discovery was called \\"slam dunk\\" evidence that \\"water flowed through underground fractures in the rock.\\" Opportunity had driven more than by November 22, 2011 (sol 2783), as preparations were made for the coming Martian winter. It moved to terrain that positioned it about 15 degrees to the north, an angle more favorable for solar energy production during the Martian winter. =2012= Looking south along Western rim of Endeavour crater, August 2011 MER-B's arrival and subsequent path around Cape York, and finally its departure as it headed south into Botany Bay towards Solander Point between 2012 and 2013 Greeley Haven View over the Endeavour crater, imaged by Opportunity in March 2012. (False-color image) In January 2012 the rover returned data from Greeley Haven, named after the geologist Ronald Greeley, while enduring its fifth Martian winter. It studied the Martian wind, which has been described as \\"the most active process on Mars today\\", and conducted a radio science experiment. By carefully measuring radio signals, wobbles in Martian rotation may show whether the planet has a solid or liquid interior. The winter worksite sits on the Cape York segment of the rim of Endeavour Crater. Opportunity reached the edge of this crater in August after three years of driving from smaller Victoria Crater, which it studied for two years. On Sol 2852 (February 1, 2012) the energy production from the solar array was 270 watt-hours, with a Mars atmospheric opacity (Tau) of 0.679, a solar array dust factor of 0.469, with total odometry at . By March (around Sol 2890), 'Amboy' rock was studied with the MIMOS II M√∂ssbauer spectrometer and the Microscopic Imager, and the amount of Argon gas in the Martian air was measured. The Mars winter solstice passed on March 30, 2012 (Sol 2909) and on April 1 there was a small cleaning event. On Sol 2913 (April 3, 2012) solar array energy production was 321 watt-hours. The mission of Mars rover Opportunity continued, and by May 1, 2012 (Sol 2940), energy production had increased to 365 watt-hours, with the solar array dust factor at 0.534. The team prepared the rover for movement and finished up collecting data on Amboy rock. 60 Doppler radio passes were completed over the winter. On May 8, 2012 (Sol 2947), the rover moved . On that day the Solar energy production was 357 watt-hours with a solar array dust factor of 0.536. Opportunity had been stationary on Greeley Haven for 130 Sols (Mars' days), with a 15 degrees tilt to the North to help survive the winter; after the drive the northerly tilt decreased to 8 degrees. The drive marked the end of the geodynamics science experiment, which used radio Doppler measurements while the rover was stationary. By June 2012, it studied Mars dust and a nearby rock vein christened \\"Monte Cristo\\" as it headed North. Traverse map showing location of Greely and the rover's track in 2012 Exploring Matijevic hill at Cape York On July 2, 2012 Opportunitys 3000 Sols on Mars were celebrated. By July 5, 2012, NASA published a new panorama (seen below) showing the surroundings of Opportunity at the Greeley Haven position at Cape York. Also, the other end of the Endeavour crater is seen in the right half of the scene, a crater that spans in diameter. On July 12, 2012 (Sol 3010), solar arrays produced 523 watt-hours and was the total distance traveled from landing. That month, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted a dust storm and water ice clouds near the rover. Before Curiosity landed on August 6, 2012, Opportunity sent special Ultra High Frequency radio signals to simulate Curiosity for a radio observatory in Australia. August activities for Opportunity included collecting data on atmospheric opacity, visiting Sao Rafael and Berrio craters, and achieving of driving on Sol 3056 (August 28, 2012). Also, on August 19, 2012 Mars Express orbiter automatically exchanged data with both Curiosity and Opportunity in one orbit, its first double contact. Spheres at Kirkwood, each are about 3 mm across In the fall Opportunity headed south, exploring Matijevic hill and searching for phyllosilicate minerals. Some data was sent to Earth directly using X-Band radio signals, as opposed to orbiter relays. Finally, the number of power cycles on the rover's Inertial Measurement Unit were reduced. Science work included testing various hypotheses about the newly discovered spherules. =2013= Leaving Cape York Esperance\\" rock on Mars ‚Äì viewed by the Opportunity Rover (February 23, 2013). Opportunity began the year at the edge of Endeavour Crater's Cape York, and the total distance travelled since landing on Mars was . After completing work at Matijevic Hill the Opportunity rover headed south to the rim of Endeavour Crater. Next, the rover headed south across a gap in the rim to a place the researchers called Botany Bay, then up onto the next rim segment to the south. There are two hills to the south of it, one called Solander Point and farther south is Cape Tribulation. The current aim is for Opportunity to reach Solander Point before winter reaches the Martian southern hemisphere as the area has ground tilted to the north allowing the rover to stay active during the winter months. In addition Solander Point has a large geological stack for Opportunity to explore. In April 2013, the rover passed through a three-week-long solar conjunction, when communication with Earth was blocked because of the Sun. The rover arm was positioned on a rock during that time so the APXS could collect data. On May 16, 2013, NASA announced that Opportunity had driven further than any other NASA vehicle on a world other than Earth. After Opportunitys total odometry went over it surpassed the total distance driven by the Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle. The record for longest distance driven by a vehicle on another world is currently held by the Lunokhod 2 lunar rover. Based on wheel rotations Lunokhod 2 was thought to have covered , but Russian scientists have revised that to an estimated distance of about based on orbital images of the lunar surface. On May 17, 2013, NASA announced that a preliminary analysis of one of the rock targets, named \\"Esperance\\", suggested that water in the past may have had a neutral pH. This was later confirmed in further studies, supporting the notion that ancient Mars was a \\"water-rich world with conditions amenable for life\\". As of June 20, 2013 (Sol 3344), Opportunitys total odometry was reported at , while en route to 'Solander Point.' June 21, 2013 marked five Martian years on the 'red planet'. The project manager, noting the harsh conditions of the planet, has said each day is \\"a gift\\". The rover on its way to Solander point, with a traverse line up to July 2013 Solander Point Solander point as seen overlooking Botany bay; Pancam image at 753, 535, and 432 nanometers light wavelengths (i.e. approximately true color). By early July 2013 Opportunity was approaching Solander Point, with daily drives ranging from dozens of meters (yards) to over a hundred. It arrived at its base in early August 2013, after investigating a curious terrain patch along the way. Solander could provide a northward facing slope to aid in sunlight collection, as the Martian winter was approaching (as the season changes, the angle of the Sun is shifting). On Sol 3390 (August 6, 2013) energy intake was 385 watt-hours, down from 395 on Sol 3384 (July 31, 2013), and 431 on Sol 3376 (July 23, 2013). In May 2013 it had been as high as 546 watt-hours. Other factors that impact collection include the atmospheric opacity (i.e. \\"Tau\\") and \\"solar array dust factor\\"dust that collects on the panels. Although the rover cannot clean the dust off, such systems were considered for the rover during its development. In September, numerous surface targets and rocks around Solander were examined by the rover. Solar array energy production dropped to 346 watt-hours by Sol 3430 (September 16, 2013), and 325 watt-hours by Sol 3452 (October 9, 2013). By traveling to locations with favorable tilt, dubbed \\"lily pads\\", Opportunity managed to receive over about 300 watt-hours per day even as the heart of the Mars winter approached. The Martian winter minimum was predicted for February 2014, but by making use of the northward slopes the rover had enough power to remain mobile during the Martian winter. By the end of October the rover was climbing up Solander point, where it was hoped some of the oldest rocks yet seen would be examined. The rocks were believed to date to Mars's Noachian Period about four billion years ago, and could have provided some science surprises by Christmas. The team was hunting for \\"juicy\\" slopes of 5 to 20 degrees for more power. As it ascended, it doglegged in early November to avoid an area of dusty ripples. It continued to collect data on Martian rocks and dust in the area. Total odometry by November 5, 2013 (or in Mars days since the landing, Sol 3478) was . Energy production from the Sun on that date was 311 watt-hours, with Tau at 0.536 and the dust factor at 0.491. Before Spirit rover stopped responding in 2010, it reported 134 watt-hours as temperatures plunged below minus 41.5 degrees Celsius (minus 42.7 degrees Fahrenheit). By early December power levels had hit 270 watt-hours per day, even as it climbed higher up the ridge. It maintained a northerly tilt to increase energy production on Solander point. In early December one of the communication relay satellites at Mars, Odyssey, had some difficulties so the rover sent its telemetry directly to Earth. The orbiter returned to operation after December 10, 2013 and the rover prepared for additional drives. On Sol 3521 (Dec. 19, 2013) the rover took micro-images and used the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer. Between December 31 and New Year's Day cleaning events removed dust, improving the Solar Array Dust Factor to 0.566 (where higher is better and 1.0 is totally clean). Energy production increased 35 watt- hours/day after this cleaning, to 371 watt-hours/day.

Self- portrait of Opportunity near Endeavour Crater on the surface of Mars (January 6, 2014). Note the change in appearance in relation to the photo nine years earlier (left). Opportunity started off 2014 on the western ridge of Endeavour crater, providing elevated panoramas of the surrounding region. Research on data from Mars orbiters identified interesting minerals on the outcrop. Some communication and difficulties the previous month delayed investigating these rocks, but on the positive side, the wait, along with a cleaning event over January 1, allowed for more electrical power to be available. The rover is tilted towards the Sun to help it get more power, and it is expected that it can remain active during the Martian winter. Opportunity's path at Solander Point and along Murray Ridge up to February 2014 (Sol 3555)  Pinnacle Island  On January 17, NASA reported that a rock, named \\"Pinnacle Island\\", that was not in a rover image taken on Sol 3528, \\"mysteriously\\" appeared 13 days later in a similar image taken on Sol 3540. One possible explanation, presented by Steven Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rover Mission, was that the rover, in one of its turning motions, flicked the rock from a few meters away and into the new location. In response, Rhawn Joseph published an article in the fringe journal Journal of Cosmology on January 17, 2014, and filed a writ of mandamus on January 27, 2014 in San Francisco Federal Court, stating that the object is a living entity and demanded that NASA re-examine the rock more closely. However, NASA already had examined the rock with the rover's microscope and analyzers, and confirmed it was a rock with a high sulphur, manganese, and magnesium content. According to Steven Squyres, \\"We have looked at it with our microscope. It is clearly a rock.\\" On February 14, 2014, NASA released an image showing the location from where the \\"Pinnacle Island\\" rock was dislodged by the Opportunity rover.  Renewed focus  On January 23, 2014, NASA celebrated the tenth anniversary (officially, January 25, 2014) of the rover's landing on Mars by sharing a self-portrait of the rover from above. They also reported on the latest discoveries of some Martian rocks and stated, \\"These rocks are older than any we examined earlier in the mission, and they reveal more favorable conditions for microbial life than any evidence previously examined by investigations with Opportunity.\\" On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective. Among many activities in March 2014, the rover studied the rock \\"Augustine,\\" and on Sol 3602 (March 12, 2014), produced 498 watt-hours from sunlight. Two cleaning events in March 2014 significantly boosted available power. Since January 2013, the solar array dust factor (one of the determinants of solar power production) varied from a relatively dusty 0.467 on December 5, 2013 (sol 3507) to a relatively clean 0.964 on May 13, 2014 (sol 3662). On July 28, 2014, NASA announced that Opportunity, after having traveled over on the planet Mars, has set a new \\"off-world\\" record as the rover having driven the greatest distance, surpassing the previous record held by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 rover that had traveled . After a series of \\"resets\\" pointed to problems with flash memory, the rover stopped driving from late August to early September, 2014, in order to reformat its flash memory. Though minor memory problems persisted in the immediate aftermath of reformatting, they did not hinder the rover's continued operation; Opportunity resumed driving towards \\"Ulysses\\" crater and \\"Marathon Valley,\\" exceeding total odometry of 41 kilometers by November 11, 2014.

Then in March 2016 it accomplished the distance of a classic marathon. Also in March 2016 it achieved the steepest slope traverse (32 degree) yet of its mission, surpassing the slope it took on at Burns Cliff in 2004. MER-B was trying to reach a target on Knudsen Ridge, on the south side of Marathon Valley, which meant attempting a steep grade which can cause wheel slippage. Another effect of this angle was that sand and dust that had collected on the rover flowed in streaks over the back of the rover, such was the incline. In 2015 MER-B entered Marathon Valley and would study it until September 2016. Opportunitys traverse up to February 2015 as it approached Spirit of Saint Louis Crater and Marathon Valley, and came close to traveling the distance of a traditional marathon (about 26 miles or 42 km) On March 23, 2015, NASA reported Opportunity flash memory was successfully reformatted. After completing analysis of the flash memory issues, engineers concluded that some of the problems stemmed from a single memory bank, one of Opportunity seven \\"banks\\" of onboard flash memory. A software upgrade was sent which allows the rover to bypass this bank, known as Bank 7. By February 2015, total odometry exceeded 42 kilometers. From July to September, the rover mostly operated using a RAM- only mode, to avoid ongoing flash memory issues. In September, a series of tests were performed to better understand the volatility of the device. During the beginning of October 2015, Opportunity began its drive to northly-tilted slopes in Marathon Valley of the west rim of Endeavour crater in preparation for the Martian winter. By November 2, after attempting to use the rover's flash memory, Opportunity again suffered an \\"amnesia\\" event. and the decision was made to switch back to use RAM on November 11 (Sol 4195). Color sat-view of MER-B's track along the Western edge of the crater up to December 2015 = 2016 = On January 3, 2016 (Sol 4246), Opportunity went through the winter solstice on Mars with already improved solar insolation, with the rover producing 449 watt-hours from its solar panels. On January 25, 2016, Opportunity had marked twelve years since landing on Mars and continued its scientific investigation of Marathon Valley. On March 21, 2016, while trying to reach target on the slope of Marathon Valley in Cape Tribulation, the Mars rover attained a slope of 32 degrees, the highest angle yet for the rover since its mission began. This was so steep that dust that had accumulated on its top panels began to flow downward. On March 31, 2016, Opportunity captured an image of a dust devil inside Endeavour crater. Although the Spirit rover saw dust devils frequently, they have been less common in the area that Opportunity is exploring. Opportunity images a Martian whirlwind (April 2016) Marathon Valley Panorma In June 2016, MER-B took a special panoramic image called the Sacagawea Panorama in honor of Sacagawea, the Lemhi Shoshone woman that helped the Lewis and Clark Expedition on their journey of exploration across America in 1804 to 1806. The image was taken of Marathon Valley at Endeavour Crater on the planet Mars. On the right side of this image is \\"Knudsen Ridge\\", and beyond Marathon valley is the floor of Endeavor crater. In the distance is the rim of crater on the other side. Marathon Valley departure In September 2016, Opportunity departed from Marathon Valley which it traversed through over the previous Earth year. As it continued to explore the Western rim of Endeavor crater, it was directed out of Lewis and Clark gap in Marathon valley, and made its way towards Spirit mound. By early October 2016, the rover had reached Spirit mound by passing through Bitterroot valley, where it began to collect data on a science target. Starting in October 2016, the three new mission goals include driving down into Endeavour Crater along what is thought to be a water-carved gully, compare the material on the plains to the interior of the crater, and to find pre-impact rocks (rocks that pre-date the impact that presumably formed Endeavour crater). By October 4, 2016, the rover had traveled 26.99 miles (43.44 km), and generated 472 watt-hours of electricity. This date was mission time of Sol (Mars days) 4514. A detailed-class rover traverse map by the mission, released on September 28, 2016 showing the track of the rover up to Sol 4500 as it heads deeper in Endeavor crater Annotated version of MER-B traverse to Spirit Mound from Marathon Valley in late 2016 The gully in the above annotated picture is a few hundred meters from the rover, and is the location of the suspected fluid-carved, possibly water, gullies that have never been investigated from the surface before. One of the MER-B goals is to drive down to this gully and examine it. Imaging Schiaparellis descent In October 2016 the ESA Schiaparelli lander attempted to land near Endeavour crater, and the two teams worked together for Opportunity to possibly image the lander during its descent. Opportunity did take pictures of the area of the sky the lander was coming down in although the lander was not identified at that time; the nature of MER-B's cameras, the terrain, and the uncertainty of the lander's location, meant imaging was not a certainty. By late October 2016 it was confirmed Schiaparelli had crashed into the surface rather than achieving a soft touchdown. Moving on The rover headed south from Spirit point after the events of ExoMars, continuing its mission on the edge of Endeavour crater. On Sol 4541 (Nov. 1, 2016), the solar array energy production is 390 watt-hours and on Sol 4548 (Nov. 8, 2016), the solar array energy production is 445 watt-hours. A readout from the EEPROM was returned to Earth, this is used in the test-bed rovers on Earth. =2017= On Sol 4623 (January 24, 2017 PST) the team celebrated 13 years operating Opportunity on the surface of Mars. By February 7, 2017 (Sol 4636) the rover had traveled 44 kilometers (27.34 miles) on the surface of Mars. Power collection from the Sun on that date was 414 watt-hours. The long-term goal at the time was a gully south of the rover on the Western rim of Endeavour crater. Science operations also continued including microscopic imaging of select rocks, APXS operation, and atmospheric argon gas measurements. Throughout 2017, Opportunity worked its way south along the Western rim as it moved towards the gully, which the team named Perseverance Valley in April 2017. Some other names considered for this feature were Perseverance Gulch, Perseverance Ravine, and Perseverance Gorge. It is a valley network that runs downslope in the Cape Bryon section of Western rim of Endeavour crater. The Martian winter reached its hardest time for the rover this year, with reduced sunlight and colder temperatures. One strategy the Rover team uses is to position the Rover on northward faced slopes to get more sunlight, and because the gully runs east-west, they were often able to use the southern edge of the gully channel of Perseverance Valley to tilt the rover this way. The Martian winter solstice was in November 2017, and it is the 8th one that MER-B has passed through.

On =2018= In 2018 the rover continued to explore the area called Perseverance Valley, the feature was previously called \\"Gully\\" and it was named by rover team in early 2017.Opportunity rover reached Perseverance Valley (the gully) in 2017 and had spent the rest the year exploring this area which is on the Western rim of Endeavor Crater; in 2018 this in-depth study continued. The Valley may have new type of rock. Perseverance Valley is thought to be a fluid-carved channel, a spillway from the surrounding planes down to the crater floor. Among the candidates for what carved the channels are water, but also ice or wind currents. One of the ongoing questions is the idea of ancient water on Mars, and how it may have impacted the modern Mars environment. In the 2010s NASA has been on the hunt for ancient fossils left by tiny living organisms especially when they make large colonies, such as Stromatolites, which look like mushroom shaped rocks but are made by colonies of bacteria. The question of ancient bacteria on Mars was raised in the 1990s, when a scientist thought he had found microscopic bacterial fossils on a meteorite that came from Mars (see ALH84001) but was found on Earth. Future missions, such as Mars 2020, may carry more advanced chemical and geological detectors to Mars with them; some images taken by Opportunity have led to speculation about whether the images contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. One example, as reported by National Geographic, appears to show a cauliflower-shaped rock in an image taken by the Spirit rover in 2007, which, to some scientists, resembled fossils of microscopic stromatolites, which are ubiquitous on Earth, and represent the earliest widely accepted example of life in Earth's biosphere. Stromatolites, thought to be signs of some of the earliest life discovered on Earth, almost 4 billion years ago, are on Earth today. Another candidate are cynobacteria which are also determined to be among the oldest life on Earth. Because of the large impacts that eject matter into space Mars has exchanged material with over long time scales, leading some to suggest life could make the journey between Earth and Mars. Indeed cynobacteria survived for almost two-years in space (Aboard ISS) and could still come alive again when put in life conditions after being in zero-g, zero-air, high radiation conditions common to outer space. On the colonization side, cyanobacteria like nostoc colonies that have been studied for terraforming are known to survive on Mars regolith simulant and lower pressures. Some the evidence for ancient water include the discovery of minerals that form in the presence of water, such as Jarosite, discovered by Opportunity at Eagle Crater in 2004. (see also Martian spherules) Opportunity studied the rock target Jornada del Muerto in Perseverance Valley, using its surviving suite of instruments including the Microscopic Imager (MI), APXS, and the color cameras. At this time rocks from the Matijevic Formation have not been found, and the valley is proving to have some complicated natures One area being studied is how the dust flows through channel and makes deposits. On Sol 4977 (Jan. 23, 2018), the stored backup flight software was updated to the latest version. On that day electrical production was 644 watt-hours, and total distance traveled on Mars since landing was 28.02 miles (45.09 kilometers).

At the time it was making its way down Perseverance Valley (aka the Gully) on the western rim of Endeavour crater, which it has been exploring in since 2011. The interior rim of the crater where Opportunity is exploring is sloped at about 15 to 20 degrees on average. *Sol 5,000 (Feb. 16, 2018) HiRise image from MRO, was laid over 3-D topographic map of the terrain, with 5-fold vertical exaggeration; view looking west on to Perseverance Valley on the western rim of Endeavour crater (February 15, 2018) On Sol 5000 the team used the rover to take a self-portrait including the Pancam mast, by using the microscopic imager on the end of the robotic arm.

Mars Opportunity rover ‚Äì diminishing visibility (simulated) due to dust storm (June 2018).Values of the energy production (in Watthours), tau (atmosphere opacity) and the dust factor for the rover Opportunity since landing in 2004. Opportunity rover ‚Äí last image (of 228,771 images; 10 June 2018) In June 2018, a local dust storm began to develop near Opportunity. The first signs of the distant storm were discovered on June 1, 2018 in photographs by the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). More weather reports from the MRO and the MARCI team indicated a prolonged storm. Although this was, at that time, still far away from the rover, it began to influence the atmospheric opacity at the rover's location. Within days, the storm had spread globally. As a result, plans were developed on June 4 and 5 to prepare for the anticipated lower power supply. Since then, the atmosphere over the rover had worsened further. On June 3, the 5105th Sol, Opportunity solar panels still generated 468 watt-hours. The atmospheric opacity (called tau value) was about 1.0. The power supply dropped to 345 watt hours on June 4 at a tau of 2.1. On June 6, only 133 watt hours were generated, the tau value was estimated at 3.0. Opportunity has not experienced such high tau levels since the last dust storm in 2007, which had an estimated tau value of 5.5. The 2018 storm had an estimated tau value of 10.8 on June 10 and the storm spanned an area of - the approximate area of both North America and Russia combined. The rover team made another plan, in which the rover gets only the latest commands at the first sol in the morning and sleeps until the next morning. The rover then wakes up in the afternoon to conduct atmospheric measurements with the Pancam and conduct a brief communication session with the MRO orbiter. However, scientific investigations were discontinued, and the rover entered continuous hibernation on June 12. Although Opportunity rover requires the power generated by solar panels to keep the central electrical components warm, it features a small radioisotope heater unit (RPU) that does not require sunlight to function,Mars Opportunity: Rover 'should ride out storm'. Jonathan Amos, BBC News. 14 June 2018. and the relatively warm summer weather is not expected to damage the electronic components at night. The winter cold is likely the reason that Opportunity twin rover Spirit stopped working in 2010. Although such dust storms are not surprising, they rarely occur. They can arise within a short time and then persist for weeks to months. During the southern season of summer, the sunlight heats dust particles and brings them higher into the atmosphere. This creates wind, which in turn stirs up more dust. This results in a feedback loop that scientists are still trying to understand, so they are taking an opportunity to study this storm from orbit using the various visible and infrared instruments on the MRO orbiter. As of June 10, 2018 the mission for Opportunity was able to extend its 92-day (Earth) mission to over 5250 days. Opportunity took its last image (of an overall total of 228,771 raw images) on June 10, 2018. On June 12, 2018, Opportunity entered safe mode as evidenced by its lack of communication. A NASA teleconference about the dust storm was presented on June 13, 2018. Opportunity team implemented additional communication times from NASA's Deep Space Network to receive up-to-date data from Mars. The data obtained showed that the temperature of the rover had fallen to . An advantage of the dust storm is that the temperature differences are not as extreme as they are on the surface of Mars. In addition, the swirled-up dust absorbs heat, thereby increasing the ambient temperature at the location of Opportunity.Opportunity Hunkers Down During Dust Storm. NASA. 12 June 2018. NASA reported on June 20, 2018 that the dust storm had grown to completely cover the entire planet. NASA stated they did not expect to resume communication until after the global dust storm subsided. After the storm At the beginning of September 2018, the atmospheric opacity (tau) over the rover site was estimated to be below 1.5. This started a 45-day window that was expected to be the best time to re-establish contact with the rover. After more than three months without contact, NASA expected Opportunity to have most of its timers in fault state. To take this into account, as of September 19, 2018, \\"sweep and beep\\" commands are sent throughout the available transmission time. By early October, the storm subsided and the atmosphere cleared up, but the rover kept silent, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or a layer of dust covered its solar panels.Opportunity Rover Still Silent on Mars, 4 Months After Epic Dust Storm Began. Mike Wall, Space.com. 12 October 2018. By November 27, 2018 NASA had attempted to contact Opportunity 359 times.

These softer candies and centers are made by filling a tray with cornstarch, stamping the desired shape into the starch, and then pouring the filling or gel into the holes made by the stamp. When the candies have set, they are removed from the trays and the starch is recycled. Starch moguls were invented around 1899 and were in common use within a decade or two. Early ones were built from wood, but later ones were made of steel.  Effects  Starch moguls reduced the number of jobs in candy factories and thereby lowered production costs for candies. All of the steps were previously performed by hand. Starch moguls also improved worker safety. Previously, starch rooms tended to have dangerously high levels of starch in the air. Workers would breathe this and develop respiratory illnesses. By reducing the amount of combustible starch in the air, the machines also significantly reduced the risk of dust explosions and fire.  Method  The starch mogul system is a method of molding candy that allows runnier materials to be used than normal processes. It is used in the manufacture of jelly beans and gummy bears,Gelatine Handbook: Theory and Industrial Practice - Page 167 and was formerly used in the manufacture of marshmallows before the advent of the extrusion process.The Marshmallow Story, Exciting Scout Craft The starch mogul system uses a machine with trays of starch.Creative forecasting - Volume 17, Issues 7-12 - Page 20 Each tray has a mold firmly pushed down in it to create cavities in the starch. The cavities are then filled with the candy material, and allowed to cool or harden as necessary. During this time, the starch helps absorb excess water, making the candy moldings handleable. Finally, the trays are dumped and the candy is separated from the starch, which is then reused by the machine. Hans Arthur Faerber, founder of NID Pty Ltd, created the current form of the starch mogul system in 1952.

Class 66 near Bruges, Belgium History The company was formed in 2000 as Dillen & Le Jeune Cargo (DLC) and was the first private company to haul a freight train in Belgium. On that moment, both founders owned 50% of the shares. In October 2001, Hupac entered the capital of DLC before the first train was effectively hauled In April 2002, the first container train was hauled for MSC from Port of Antwerp to Aachen West station by a Class 66 locomotive (leased from Porterbrook), and further to Schwandorf station with another Hupac-hired electric locomotive, breaking the monopoly of state owned NMBS/SNCB (although Belgian freight rail transport was officially opened to private operators only in March 2003, DLC operates based on European directives from 1991 and a security license for the Belgian rail network). A security license to access the Dutch network was obtained at the beginning of 2003, with the first train hauled to Waalhaven on January 11. Trains to and from the Zeelandic Flanders (a part of Netherlands which is not directly connected to the remainder of the Dutch rail network) became recurring traffic, with the Terneuzen based Bertschi container terminal as client. In October 2007, DLC merged with Swiss Babcock & Brown owned Crossrail AG. Hupac had left the capital of DLC, so the shareholding structure was dispatched between both DLC founders (having 25.5% each) and Babcock & Brown for the remainder. The merged company operates as Crossrail AG, with subsidiaries in Belgium and Italy. In September 2008, the company acquired a security license to train its own drivers. Problems between both founders resulted in August 2008 in Jeroen Le Jeune leaving the company for a few months. As Babcock & Brown was facing strong difficulties after the global credit crunch, Jeroen Le Jeune came back and bought their 49% shares in August 2009, together with the shares from Ronny Dillen. In September 2009, Crossrail successfully sued Belgian rail network manager Infrabel for having given full priority to passenger traffic instead of treating all rail operators equally during a strike. As traffic grew, Le Jeune quickly faced liquidity problems and searched partners to refund the company: The first candidate was no newcomer. Hupac took a 25% participation on August 24, 2010. As of February 2012, two customers of the company ‚Äî Austria based LKW Walter and G√©n√©ral Transport Service (GTS) from Italy ‚Äî acquired respectively 25% and 10% of the shares, with Le Jeune group reducing to 40%. Two other customers ‚Äî Bertschi AG and MSC ‚Äî each took 10% of shares from Le Jeune in July 2012. More recently, control of the company has transferred into the hands of Rhenus Group (75%) and LKW Walter (25%).http://www.worldcargonews.com/htm/n20150226.628506.htm) In March 2019, BLS Cargo announced its intent to buy Crossrail.https://www.bls.ch/de/unternehmen/medien/medienmitteilungen/2019/03-07-cargo- crossrail See also *Euro Cargo Rail DB Schenker subsidiary operating in France *NMBS/SNCB - Belgian state owned railways References and notes =Notes= =References= External links *Official website Category:Railway companies of Belgium Category:Railway companies established in 2000 ","title":"Crossrail Benelux"},{"id":"42307361","text":"GSpot is a Windows-based freeware program designed to identify the codecs used in video files.

Anti-gal is a human natural antibody that interacts specifically with the mammalian carbohydrate structure gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R, termed, the alpha- galactosyl epitope. The alpha-gal molecule is found in all mammals except apes, humans, and Old World monkeys. Bites from certain ticks, such as the lone star tick (Am. americanum) in the US, and the paralysis tick in Australia, which can transfer this carbohydrate to a victim, have been implicated in the development of this delayed allergic response to consumption of mammalian meat products. Individuals with alpha-gal allergy do not need to become strict vegetarians, because poultry, fish, and in rare cases for some people, lean meat such as venison does not trigger a reaction. Alpha-gal allergy has been reported in 17 countries on all 6 continents where humans are bitten by ticks, particularly the United States and Australia. In the US, the allergy most often occurs in the central and southern regions, which corresponds to the distribution of the lone star tick. In the Southern United States, where the tick is most prevalent, allergy rates are 32% higher than elsewhere. However, as doctors are not required to report the number of patients with alpha-gal allergy, the true number of affected individuals is unknown. Alpha-gal has also been shown to exist in the saliva of Ix. scapularis but not Am. maculatum. A typical allergic reaction to alpha-gal has a delayed onset, occurring 3‚Äì8 hours after the consumption of mammalian meat products, in contrast to the typical rapid onset of most food allergies. After the delayed onset, the allergic response is like most food allergies, and especially an IgE-mediated allergy, including severe whole-body itching, hives, angioedema, gastrointestinal upset, and possible anaphylaxis. In 70% of cases the reaction is accompanied by respiratory distress and as such is particularly harmful to those with asthma. Alpha-gal allergies are the first known food allergies that present the possibility of delayed anaphylaxis. It is also the first known food-related allergy associated with a carbohydrate, rather than a protein. Other mammalian products containing alpha-gal other than meat such as milk and gelatin may also trigger an allergic reaction. Cause Amblyomma americanum, a vector for the allergy Alpha-gal allergies develop after a person has been bitten by the lone star tick in the United States, the European castor bean tick, the paralysis tick and Ixodes (Endopalpiger) australiensis in Australia, Haemaphysalis longicornis in Japan, and a currently unknown tick in South Africa, possibly Amblyomma hebraeum. Alpha-gal is not naturally present in apes, Old World monkeys, or humans, but is in all other mammals. If a tick feeds on another mammal, the alpha-gal remains in its alimentary tract. The tick then injects the alpha-gal into a person's skin, which causes the immune system to release a flood of IgE antibodies to fight the foreign carbohydrate. Researchers still do not know which specific component of tick saliva causes the reaction. A 2012 preliminary study found unexpectedly high rates of alpha-gal allergy in the Western and North Central parts of the United States. This suggests that unknown tick species may spread the allergy. The study even found alpha-gal allergy cases in Hawaii, where no ticks identified with the allergies live. Human factors were suggested, but no specific examples were provided. Alpha- gal is present in the anticancer drug cetuximab, as well as the intravenous fluid replacements Gelofusine and Haemaccel. Blood thinners derived from porcine intestine and replacement heart valves derived from porcine tissue may also contain alpha-gal. At least one instance of a man with an alpha-gal allergy going into anaphylaxis after receiving a heart valve transplant has been reported. Some researchers have suggested that the alpha-gal in pig's tissue that surgeons use for xenografts might contribute to organ rejection. Mechanism Recent research has shown that saliva from the lone star tick contains alpha-gal, and that saliva is injected into the blood stream. The immune system then releases IgE antibodies to fight this foreign sugar. After this reaction, the future intake of mammal meat with the same alpha-gal causes an allergic reaction. Symptoms of the allergy reaction are caused by too many IgE antibodies attacking the allergen, in this case the alpha-gal. Diagnosis A traditional skin-prick allergy test for allergy to meat may give a false-negative answer. Determination of specific IgE to alpha-gal testing is commercially available, as well as IgE testing to specific red meats. Skin and basophil activation tests with cetuximab are the most sensitive, but high costs limit their use. Prognosis  Unlike most food allergies, in some people, the alpha-gal allergy may recede over time, as long as the person is not bitten by another tick. The recovery period can take 8 months to 5 years.  Desensitization  So far, only two successful desensitizations have been performed on patients with an alpha-gal allergy. History Ixodes holocyclus, the species of hard-bodied tick most likely to be responsible in Australia for instances of alpha-gal allergy. The allergy was first formally identified as originating from tick bites in the United States in 2002 by Thomas Platts-Mills, and independently by Sheryl van Nunen in Australia in 2007. Platts-Mills and Scott Commins were attempting to discover why some people were reacting negatively to the carbohydrate in the cancer drug cetuximab. They had previously hypothesized that a fungal infection or parasite could lead to the allergy. When Platts-Mills was bitten by a tick and developed alpha-gal allergies, his team came to the conclusion that a link existed between tick bites and the allergy. They found that the IgE antibody response to the mammalian oligosaccharide epitope, alpha-gal, was associated with both the immediate-onset anaphylaxis during first exposure to intravenous cetuximab and the delayed-onset anaphylaxis 3 to 6 hours after ingestion of mammalian food products, such as beef or pork. Van Nunen, an immunologist specialising in allergies, had been practicing in a tick-prone area of Sydney, when 25 patients reported having allergic reactions to red meat after being bitten by ticks. She later concluded that the relatively sudden rise in cases was the result of a local fox baiting program which began in 2003. Foxes were introduced to Australia and had decimated the local indigenous bandicoot population, hence the fox baiting program. However an unforeseen effect of the subsequent rise in the bandicoot population was the rise in ticks, as bandicoots are a major host for ticks, and thus the number of humans suffering tick bites. Alpha-gal allergies are similar to pork‚Äìcat syndrome, hence misidentification can occur. Pork‚Äìcat syndrome usually elicits an immediate allergic response, while a true alpha-gal allergy typically features a delayed allergic reaction of 3 to 8 hours after ingestion of the allergen.

Hoped-for support failed to materialize and all eight of the insurgents were killed by troops loyal to Duvalier. Contemporary newspaper articles sometimes referred to the coup attempt as 'Pasquet's Invasion' or 'the Sheriffs Invasion' (as some of the Americans involved were former sheriff's deputies). Coup leader Alix Pasquet, date unknown. Background Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier was elected President of Haiti in September 1957. A doctor and former Minister of Health, he was initially seen by many Haitians as a populist reformer; however, he soon began to display behavior typical of an autocrat. Rival political parties were banned, and independent newspapers were shut down. Mixed-race mulattoes, who formed much of Haiti's upper class - and who were a source of much of the opposition to Duvalier - were frequently harassed, arrested, or forced into exile. Among those exiled were three former officers in the Haitian Army: Captain Alix \\"Sonson\\" Pasquet, Lt. Phillipe \\"Fito\\" Dominique, and Lt. Henri \\"Riquet\\" Perpignan.'We Remember', by Frantz Haspil, ford9 website,pstd 7 29 06, retvd 3 25 14; http://www.fordi9.com/Pages/Affair29July58.htm Pasquet was an aviator who had trained and served in combat with the Tuskegee Airmen during the Second World War.'The Siege of Casernes Dessalines: the Story of Alix Pasquet, Haitian Tuskegee Airman'; the Haitian Blogger, pstd 1 23 12, retvd 3 25 14 http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2012/01/siege-of-casernes-dessalines- story-of.html He was from a prominent mulatto family, and had also been a star player on Haiti's national football team. Dominique and Perpignan were also mulatto army officers. Dominique was Pasquet's brother-in-law. From exile in Miami, Florida, Pasquet led a political movement to overthrow Duvalier and restore Haiti's traditional social order. At the same time, he, Dominique, and Perpignan began plotting a direct strike against the Duvalier government. Although the U.S. government was tepidly supportive of the anti-communist Duvalier, the exiles befriended five Americans who were willing to accompany them on a mission to Haiti. The Americans - Arthur Payne, Dany Jones, Levant Kersten, Robert F. Hickey, and Joe D. Walker \\\\- were intrigued by the promise of adventure and a possibly very lucrative outcome. A yacht captained by Walker, the Molly C, would take them to Haiti. Pasquet's plan was to land near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, seize the Casernes Dessalines (an army barracks near the National Palace), and from there summon old friends in military units he had served with. He knew the area well and felt confident that many officers and troops would quickly rally to the anti-Duvalier cause. Using the large cache of weapons and ammunition stored in the Casernes Dessalines, they would then seize the Palace and other key facilities. The eight well-armed invaders left Miami aboard the Molly C on or about 25 July. The coup attempt On the afternoon of 28 July 1958 the insurgents' yacht arrived off Montrouis, in an area known as D√©luge, about forty-five miles north of Port-au-Prince. The three Haitians, in military uniform, and the five Americans, dressed as tourists, began transferring weapons and supplies from the Molly C to a small beach cabin. They were observed by local peasants, who alerted the headquarters of the St. Marc's military district. That evening, a Haitian officer and three soldiers who arrived in a jeep to investigate were fired on by the rebels; one soldier was killed on the spot, and the other three wounded, all later dying. One of the Americans, Arthur Payne, a former Miami-Dade County sheriff's deputy, was wounded in the leg. Taking the jeep, Pasquet and his men began driving to Port-au-Prince.Haiti: A Shattered Nation, by Elizabeth Abbot; Penguin, 2011 Duvalier during July 1958 coup attempt. En route to the capital the rebels flagged down and commandeered a passing tap tap, one of the brightly decorated mini-bus taxis common in Haiti. Arriving at the Dessalines barracks about 10 p.m., Pasquet bluffed his way past sentries, saying he was delivering prisoners. Before long, however, the tap tap and its occupants attracted the attention of the garrison, and firing broke out. Three Haitian soldiers were shot, and about 50 more - most of whom had been sleeping - were placed under guard, with officers tied to chairs. Pasquet was disappointed to learn that there was no enthusiasm among the soldiers for a rising against Duvalier, and that most of the arms usually stored at Casernes Dessalines had recently been transferred to the National Palace. Rather than lead an immediate assault on the palace, he entered the commandant's office and began making phone calls to friends in the army - none of whom, to his growing consternation, showed any interest in joining him. The gunfire - and Pasquet's phone calls - had alerted Duvalier that trouble was afoot at the barracks, but initially he had no idea of the scope of the uprising, and reportedly prepared his family for evacuation to the Liberian embassy. Calling the commandant of the Dessalines barracks, he instead got Pasquet, who infuriated Duvalier by demanding that he surrender immediately. In a story of uncertain veracity which was later widely reported, one of the plotters (usually identified as Perpignan) was so eager to enjoy his favorite blend of local tobacco that he gave some money to a mulatto soldier and sent him to a nearby store to buy a packet of \\"Splendide\\" cigarettes. The soldier - reportedly Duvalier's personal driver - immediately ran to the National Palace, where he informed the Presidential Guard that the rebels were only eight in number, one of them wounded. The small size of the rebel force was confirmed by other soldiers who had managed to escape from the barracks. While Pasquet frantically called around for help, President Duvalier donned uniform, helmet, and pistol-belt'A Weird, Fatal Dash To Turbulent Haiti', Life magazine, August 11, 1958 and began rallying his supporters; meanwhile, several Army officers had already begun surrounding and sealing off the Casernes Dessalines, placing heavy machine guns at key positions around the facility. At daybreak on 29 September the Haitian army's counterattack began, with Pasquet reportedly killed by a grenade blast while still using the phone in the commandant's office. Perpignan was killed while attempting to flee out the back of the building; the wounded American, Arthur Payne, allegedly tried to claim he was an American journalist before being shot, and Levant Kersten may have briefly succeeded in blending into the growing crowd of civilians before being spotted and killed. Dominique and the tattooed captain of the Molly C, Joe Walker, were found in the barracks riddled with bullets. All eight of the rebels were killed. Aftermath Pasquet and his men had badly miscalculated the mood of the Haitian public and the military. While Duvalier's dictatorial tendencies were becoming increasingly plain, he was still seen, after a long period of political turmoil, as a strong force for stability and unity. The bodies of some of the coup plotters were dragged through the streets of Port-au-Prince to cheering crowds, and Duvalier was photographed in uniform and hailed in the Haitian press as having led the counterattack on the coup plotters himself. Pasquet's was the first of many coup attempts against Duvalier's government. It had the effect of deepening Duvalier's fear of any dissent, and inspired him to create the National Security Volunteer Militias - the infamous \\"Tonton Macoutes\\" - which would terrorize Haiti for decades to come.Papa Doc and the Tontons Macoutes, by Bernard Diederich & Alan Burton; Markus Wiener Publishers, Incorporated, 1969 After the Duvalier era, 'Sonson' Pasquet came to be seen in Haiti as both a foolish and gallant figure. In 1973 his son, also named Alix Pasquet, married and had two children with Michele Bennett, who later married and had two children with Francois Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, making 'Sonson' and 'Papa Doc's grandchildren half siblings.

Prototyped during Double Fine's open Amnesia Fortnight 2012, Hack 'n' Slash is a top-down action-adventure game similar to The Legend of Zelda, though with in-game weapons and objects that allow the player to hack the game's world to achieve victory. The game was released to Steam's Early Access on May 6, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux computers. It left early access status and became a full release on September 9, 2014. Gameplay The player controls the game's primary character, Alice (a reference to the common Alice and Bob placeholder names), armed with a \\"USB Sword\\" from a top-down view. While the player can use the sword and other weapons and tools to explore dungeons and fight enemies in a traditional manner, the sword itself can also interact in special ways with any game object, including enemies and obstacles, that has a USB port. At this point, the player can alter the basic parameters of the object to alter their behavior. Examples include adjusting the movement speed of an enemy, or setting a container's hit points to zero causing it to collapse and release its contents. The player can also hack Alice's variables, such as her name or health points. For game objects that lack these USB ports, the player can use limited bombs that pause the execution of code from objects caught in the explosion, allowing them to temporarily hack the object's code, such as setting a flag that gives these objects a USB port to be hacked further. The player can interact with any object in Hack 'n' Slash that possess a USB port (like the diamond-shaped pillars in the middle of the screen) to access the object's code and adjust its parameters to achieve various goals Another tool Alice has is the Third Eye Hat that opens a debugging interface, the same that Double Fine has used to create and test the game. Through this, the player can see elements of the code behind the objects, such as the contents of a container or invisible blocks. Although the player cannot hack the code while in debug mode, they can use this knowledge to achieve goals. In one case, with a series of invisible blocks floating very slowly over a chasm, the player is able to hack the game's internal clock that would, to the player, speed up the movement of the blocks. Completing quests earns the player in-game books that represent the actual code files used by the game, which the player can read to understand game mechanics and hack to alter how some process the game uses are done. For example, one book gives code for how bridges in the game are built, and the player can hack the book to cause the bridges to become longer as needed. All these changes are directly affecting the base code that the main adventure game runs with, and with improper changes, it is possible for the player to corrupt their saved game or break the mechanics of the adventure game, but the game's program will allow the player to go back to restored versions of the game's code to fix these. Development Hack 'n' Slash was one of several ideas presented for voting for Double Fine's Amnesia Fortnight 2012 project, where users would be able to vote for the game concepts they felt they would want to play the most. Hack 'n' Slash was an idea presented by senior programmer Brandon Dillon, presented as a Zelda-like game with the ability to hack the game's features. The title received the most votes and was one of five other titles that Double Fine stated they would develop into full games. A full commercial version of the game was announced in December 2013, with expected released on Windows, Mac, and Linux in the first half of 2014. The announcement also revealed that part of the game's funding will come from the Indie Fund. The announcement also contained a single image that linked to a large compressed computer file that users have decoded to find out information about the game's world. Dillon explained that the full version is less an adventure game and \\"really this puzzle game that teaches you about hacking\\", proving a learning curve to help players learn each of the tools provided in the game. Release The game released as an early access title on Steam on May 6, 2014. The early access model is intended to facilitate fine-tuning the game's puzzles given its unusual mechanics, as well as allowing for integration of Steam Workshop features.

K√∂hler conducted premieres of works by Hans Werner Henze and Volker David Kirchner, among others, and revived rarely performed operas. He also composed music for the stage and taught at universities of music in Cologne and Saarbr√ºcken.  Career  Born in Freiburg im Breisgau the son of a horn player, K√∂hler studied harp at the Musikhochschule Freiburg. From 1942, he worked at the Theater Heilbronn as a harpist and repetiteur. During World War II he was a Funker (radio operator). He conducted from 1946 in Freiburg, promoted in 1952 to 1. Kapellmeister (first conductor). From 1954, he worked at the opera in D√ºsseldorf. From 1957, he conducted at the Cologne Opera, and later became its Generalmusikdirektor (GMD). He conducted there in 1958 the first staged performance of Hans Werner Henze's ballet Das Vokaltuch der Kammersangerin Rosa Silber, with choreography by . He was also director of the Opernstudio of the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln. K√∂hler was GMD in Saarbr√ºcken from 1964 to 1974, and simultaneously was professor of conducting at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Saar. The soprano Inge Borkh recalled that K√∂hler was called to the Staatsoper Stuttgart to step in to prepare Richard Strauss' Die Frau ohne Schatten in 1970 because he had an understanding of the singers' breathing techniques. From 1974 to 1988, K√∂hler was GMD at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden. He presented an unusual repertoire, including Auber's Die Stumme von Portici and Wagner's Rienzi (with Jon Buzea in the title role, Eike Wilm Schulte as Steffano Colonna and Gail Gilmore as Adriano). K√∂hler conducted a performance during the Internationale of 1979 which was recorded live, with Gerd Brenneis as Rienzi, Jeannine Altmeyer as Irene and as Adriano. He revived operas by Siegfried Wagner, holding days devoted to the composer twice, with concert performances of Sternengebot in 1977, and of Sonnenflammen in 1979. K√∂hler conducted premieres of operas by Volker David Kirchner, Die Trauung (The Wedding) in 1975 and Das kalte Herz (The Cold Heart) in 1981. He appeared as a guest conductor internationally with notable orchestras. From 1989, K√∂hler was chief conductor at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm.

Many individuals have an interest in tracking wildlife, including biologists, scientific researchers, and conservationists. Biotelemetry is \\"the instrumental technique for gaining and transmitting information from a living organism and its environment to a remote observer\\".Slater, L. E. 1965. Introduction (special issue on telemetry). Bioscience 15(2):81‚Äì82. 1800s =Bird banding= John James Audubon, a French American naturalist, ornithologist, and painter was the first person that attempted to paint and describe all the birds of America. In 1803, he conducted the first known bird banding experiment in North America and tied strings around the legs of Eastern Phoebes. He observed that the birds would return to the same nesting site every year, demonstrating philopatry. Bird banding was used in 1890 by Hans Christian C. Mortensen, a Danish biologist. Birds can be captured by hand, using mist-nets, cannon-nets, or cage traps. A band that is typically made out of aluminum, or coloured plastic is attached to the leg of the bird. Each band has a unique identification code so that when birds are later recaptured, individuals can be identified.Cleminson A, Nebel S. 2012. Bird Banding. Nature Education Knowledge. 3(8): 1. Mist-nets became widely available in the early 1950s, which dramatically increased the recovery of marked birds. Early 1930s =Scale clipping= The first scientific paper on scale clipping was published in 1933.Blanchard, F. N. and E. B. Finster. 1933. A method of marking living snakes for future recognition, with a discussion of some problems and results. Ecology 14:334-347. Sharp dissecting or microsurgical scissors are used to clip specific ventrals on snakes. A serial enumeration system is used so that individuals can be identified based on the scarring pattern.Brown WS and Parker WS. 1976. A Ventral Scale Clipping System for Permanently Marking Snakes (Reptilia, Serpentes). J Herpetol. 10(3): 247-249. 1940s =Radar= During World War II, birds that were migrating caused \\"phantom signals\\" or \\"radar angels\\" to appear on radar screens.Harper, W.G. 1958. Detection of Bird Migration by Centimetric Radar-- a Cause of Radar 'Angels'. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences. 149(937): 484-502. Since then, radar has become a widely used method for studying migrating organisms. Early radar technologies, such as WSR-57 (Weather Surveillance Radar - 1957), have been replaced by the Next Generation Weather Radar program (NEXRAD) which was installed in segments during the 1990s. Also known as WSR-88D (Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler), NEXRAD is a doppler system that replaced older non-Doppler meteorological radars. NEXRAD can determine both the direction and speed of migrating individuals that are traveling both towards and away from the radar.Russell, K. R. & Gauthreaux, Jr., S. A. Use of weather radar to characterize movements of roosting purple martins. Wildlife Society Bulletin 26, 5-16 (1998). =Isotope analysis= Isotope analysis is based on the principle that most elements exist in two or more forms, known as isotopes. Isotopes have the same number of protons but differ in their number of neutrons, resulting in different masses. This variation in the relative abundance of stable isotopes results from tiny mass differences that cause the isotopes to act differently in chemical reactions and physical processes. Different environments are often characterized by predictable isotopic signatures, meaning that organism's unique isotopic signatures can be traced to unique environments containing the same isotope signatures.West, J. B. et al. Stable isotopes as one of nature's ecological recorders. Trends in Ecology & Evolution 21, 408-414 (2006). The fundamental design of isotope ratio mass spectrometers, a tool used for analyzing isotopes, has not changed since the 1940s. Stable-isotope analysis (SIA) is frequently used with birds since only one capture is needed to determine its breeding origin. SIA is based on the principle that birds will retain isotopic information in their tissues that are based on the isotopic landscapes they inhabited in the recent past. Isotopic information is obtained mostly from feathers, since the keratin in feathers is metabolically inert. For various bird species tested, their feathers' elemental turnover rate is positively correlated with their metabolic rate. A problem with SIA occurs if birds undergo protein catabolism during migration and their isotopic information is subsequently lost as a result of blood-cell replacement. SIA is difficult to employ on birds that switch their diets seasonally due to the difficulty of separating isotopic changes due to location change from isotopic changes due to diet change. The elements that are primarily analyzed for SIA are: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur. Isotopic variation among plants is largely based on differences in photosynthetic pathways. The method is beneficial since it relies on capturing an individual only once. Important information can be obtained from something as simple as a birds' feather, which is relatively easily and painlessly extracted. 1950s =Acoustic telemetry= Acoustic telemetry is based on the principles of sonar, which was developed to detect submarines during World War I. The properties of acoustic systems favour their use in deep waters with high conductivity and low turbulence. The first acoustic telemetry equipment was developed for studying fish in 1956 by the U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and the Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Corporation. Individuals that want to track marine wildlife in salt water face unique challenges. Radio waves are highly absorbed by salt water, making them a poor choice for sending messages through the ocean. Sound waves, on the other hand, are not similarly impeded by seawater. Due to the fact that sound can travel more than 4 times faster in water than in air, this allows for near real-time listening over long distances with proper acoustic telemetry equipment. Acoustic signals are the preferred communication tool for researchers who wish to track fish and wildlife in marine habitats in real time. As with radio, acoustic telemetry requires transmitters to send signals and receivers to hear them. The transmitters are electronic tags that emit a series of sound pulses into the surroundings. They can be surgically implanted or attached externally to an organism. The range of signal reception can vary from a few meters to more than a thousand meters. The signal typically transmits once every minute or two, in order to conserve battery life. Receivers are small, data-logging computers that ‚Äúlisten‚Äù for tagged individuals. When a signal is identified, the tag's unique ID code is saved with the date and time. The data from any single receiver provide a record of each signal to that location by a tagged individual. Researchers might deploy many receivers over large regions to understand the movement patterns of tagged individuals. Hydrophones, a type of underwater microphone, receive acoustic signals and then either store or convert them into radio signals for rapid transmission through the air to receivers on shore. Fixed-site acoustic receiver system used during the late 1950s. Data was recorded on both paper and magnetic tape. 1960s =VHF telemetry= VHF (very high frequency) telemetry typically requires a user to acquire VHF transmissions from a VHF transmitter (usually in a collar attached to the animal) using a hand-held antenna. VHF signals are either received by mobile or stationary receivers equipped with directional antennae. The location of the transmitter can then be determined by acquiring the transmissions from three (or more) different locations to triangulate the location of the device. VHF tracking is more commonly known as \\"radio-tracking.\\" ‚ÄúRadio-tracking is a revolutionary technique for studying many kinds of free-ranging animals. By March 1979, one of the leading commercial suppliers of radio tracking equipment had sold over 17,500 radio collars. Numerous species, from crayfish through elephants, have been studied with this technique in widespread regions of the world, from pole to pole and in most major countries of the world‚Äù. The idea of using tiny radio transmitters attached to animals to track those creatures occurred to several people in the 1950s when transistors were rapidly replacing vacuum tubes, thus minimizing the size of devices that could produce radio signals. Concurrently, some workers started developing such devices to monitor animal heart rates and respiration while others strove to embed transmitters in collars and harnesses so animal locations could be tracked.Craighead, F. C., Jr., et al., 1963. In L. E. Slater (ed.) Radiotracking of Grizzly Bears. Bio- Telemetry, Proceedings of the Interdisciplinary Conference, New York, March, 1962, pp. 133-148. Pergamon Press, Inc., New York, USAMarshall, W. H., and J. J. Kupa. 1963. Development of radio-telemetry techniques for ruffed grouse studies. Transactions of the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference 28:443-456. Each of these groups involved wildlife biologists teaming up with electronics engineers or technicians to build the radio- transmitters. Of these electronics experts, William (Bill) W. Cochran, while an undergraduate student with the University of Illinois, had been working on the radio transmitting systems for some of the earliest satellites for the U. S. Army. George Swenson,Swenson, G. W. Copyright 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Reprinted from the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, vol. 36, no. 2, pp.32-35, April 1994. https://ece.illinois.edu/about/history/reminiscence/space.asp principal investigator on a NASA-sponsored University of Illinois project to study Sputnik-era radio propagation through the Earth's ionosphere, had this to say about him: ‚Äú... [Cochran] had been responsible for building and operating our field stations for a couple of years. He'd demonstrated exceptional skill with transistor circuits. Bill and I decided we could build a couple of satellite payloads, and we started to experiment with circuits and various kinds of batteries.‚Äù ‚Äú...while he was designing satellite transmitters and receivers, [he] was also moonlighting for wildlife biologists of the Illinois Natural History Survey. They had the idea that small radio transmitters, attached to rabbits, might allow them to track the animals into their burrows, and establish their activity patterns. It worked. Success led to a suggestion from an ornithologist that perhaps birds could be tracked in flight.‚Äù According to Cochran (8/23/19), wildlife biologist Frank Bellrose wished to test the direction in which translocated mallard ducks flew when released into a new area. Cochran built a transmitter to attach to the duck with a light metal band around its chest, and when the duck passed a station where Cochran was monitoring a satellite, he was able to record the signal. Swenson continued: ‚ÄúAs [the duck] breathed quietly, the metal band periodically distorted and pulled the frequency, causing a varying beat note from the receiver. An audio- frequency discriminator was available, so the frequency variations could be recorded on a strip chart. When the bird was released into the air, its breathing was recorded on the chart, and in addition, a higher-frequency modulation representing its wing beats. The biologists informed us that we'd made the first measurements of the relation between the wing beats and the breathing of a flying bird, thus answering a long-standing question,‚Äù as well as the direction in which the duck flew. ‚ÄúOf course I was very young and cared little about what ducks do and knew nothing about publishing and didn‚Äôt even care if they included me as a co-author,‚Äù stated Cochran (8/23/19). ‚ÄúBill Cochran followed these successes with a long career in radio-telemetry applications in wildlife research. After leaving our program, he developed wildlife radio tracking to a high degree of effectiveness, founding the company that pioneered the business . . .‚Äù Meanwhile, Dwaine Warner, professor of ornithology, University of Minnesota, a very creative and forward-thinking researcher, had received a grant to use electronic technology to monitor various animals at the university's Cedar Creek Natural History Area, some 40 km north of the Twin Cities. One of his first actions was to hire Cochran, still an undergraduate, to design a system to automatically concurrently monitor the movements of various animals in that study area. Etienne Benson (2010) wrote, ‚ÄúThey invited him to visit the group in Minnesota in the fall of 1961, and a few months later he moved to the Twin Cities to take charge of the Museum of Natural History‚Äôs bioelectronics laboratory. The museum group had had some success transmitting temperature measurements from rabbits on the roof of the building to their basement laboratory with their own tag, but after Cochran arrived they shifted to his design.‚ÄùBenson, E. 2010. Wired Wilderness: Technologies of Tracking and the Making of Modern Wildlife. The Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, Maryland, USA The automatic radio- tracking system that Cochran devised, with its biologists, engineers, and technicians led by Cochran, became a radio-tracking center. That center not only produced many papers based on its own radio-tracking research, but it also developed new techniques, refined the tiny radio transmitters, attachment methods, and signal receivers and generally fostered the entire field through formal and informal collaboration with other biologists and engineers as well as spinning off businesses that commercially supplied the equipment. The radio-tracking revolution had begun. Mech's Handbook of Animal Radio-tracking included the following: ‚ÄúThis book is dedicated to William W. Cochran, Illinois Natural History Survey, who, many of us believe, has done more to further the field of animal radio-tracking than any other single person.‚Äù 1970s =Photo-identification= MARKResearchers and whale watchers that observed humpback whales realized that each individual humpback whale has unique pigmentation and scarring patterns on their tail flukes. Beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to recognize individual whales based on their tail flukes using photo-identification. Since then, photo-identification has been used to study many marine species in order to determine aspects of their biology, ecology, and behaviour. Rather than spend time compiling and analyzing the numerous photographs, computer programs have been created to help researchers identify individuals and resighting events using existing photo-identification catalogues. One such program, Fluke Matcher, reconciles the many thousands of photographs of humpback whales by using several different features of the fluke such as size, shape, black and white pigment distribution, and other distinctive features. By relying on many criteria, Fluke Matcher can identify individual whales from poorer quality or incomplete photographs. Regular \\"citizen scientists\\" and whale watchers can upload their own photographs to these computer programs, helping scientists determine if an individual matches another from the database.Kniest E, Burns D, Harrison P. 2010. Fluke Matcher: A computer aided matching system for humpback whale (Megapteranovaeangliae) flukes. Mar. Mamm. Sci. 26(3): 744-756. Researchers use variation on humpback whale flukes to identify and track whales. 1980s =PIT tags= Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags consist of an integrated circuit chip, capacitor, and antenna coil encased in glass. They have been used since the mid 1980s with scientists studying fish movements. Since then, PIT tags have been used to study the movement of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and invertebrates.Gibbons, J. W. & Andrews, K. M. PIT tagging: Simple technology at its best. BioScience 54, 447-454 (2004). The tags act as a lifetime barcode for an organism and provided they can be scanned, are as reliable as a fingerprint. PIT tags are dormant until activated and therefore do not require any internal source of power throughout their lifespan. To activate the tag, a low-frequency radio signal is emitted by a scanning device that generates a close-range electromagnetic field. The tag then sends a unique alpha-numeric code back to the reader,Keck M. B. Test for detrimental effects of PIT tags in neonatal snakes. Copeia 1994, 226-228 (1994). effectively identifying the individual organism. Internal PIT tags are inserted via large-gauge needles or surgically implanted either subcutaneously or into a body cavity. PIT tagging can be used to answer questions regarding growth rates, survivorship, food webs, and movement patterns. A major advantage over mark-recapture methods is that marked animals do not need to be recaptured; they just need to pass by an automated reading system antenna. PIT tag is shown next to an American penny. PIT tags are about the size of a grain of rice. 1990s =Geolocator= First described in 1992, a geolocator is a device that periodically records ambient light level (solar irradiance) as a means of determining an organism's location. Geolocators have been especially useful for tracking bird migration because there are small and lightweight ones that do not utilize satellite or radio telemetry for real-time monitoring. The major disadvantage is that organism's need to be recaptured in order to obtain data from the device.Estimation of location: global coverage using light intensity, Wilson R.P., Ducamp J., Rees W.G., Culik B.M., Niekamp K., in Wildlife Telemetry: remote monitoring and tracking of animals, Priede I.M., Swift S.M. (eds), Ellis Horward, Chichester, p131-134, 1992. Light levels that are recorded can be used to determine the latitude and longitude, and thus provide information on the location of organisms. When the organism is in a shaded environment, due to clouds, feathers, or foliage, a problem occurs since the geolocator does not record accurate light levels. =GPS receiver= GPS technology enables individuals to observe relatively fine- scale movement or migratory patterns in a free-ranging wild animal using the Global Positioning System. After fitting animals with a GPS receiver, their position is determined by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth, and the location of satellites sending the signals. As soon as GPS became available for civilian use in the 1990s, biologists started to attach GPS receivers to animals. Although the first civilian GPS receivers were developed by Magellan in 1989, they were very large and therefore impractical for animal applications. By the mid-1990s, the larger GPS manufacturing companies created GPS receivers that were smaller, more energy- efficient, and therefore more usable for animal-tracking applications. GPS tracking devices are often linked to an Argos Platform Transmitter Terminal (PTT) enabling them to transmit data via the Argos System, a scientific satellite system which has been in use since 1978. Users can then download their data directly from Argos via telnet and process the raw data to extract their transmitted information. Data can also be transmitted via GSM networks, using SMS messages or internet protocols in a GPRS session. =GSM Mobile Phone Telemetry= A new telemetry system based on GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) mobile phone technology was first described in 1998 as a technique that provides more detailed mark-recapture data over an extensive geographical range. Organisms are fitted with a mobile phone tag that is programmed to attempt to send a text message back to the laboratory at regular intervals. The received messages are analyzed in order to determine the organism's estimated location.McConnell B, Beaton R, Bryant E, Hunter C, Lovell P, Hall A. (2004). Phoning home - A new GSM mobile phone telemetry system to collect mark-recapture data. Marine Mammal Science, 20 (2): 274-283. Mobile phone telemetry is advantageous since it is easy to set up with relatively low maintenance costs, it allows for two-way communications, and required a low profile, non-directional antenna on the receiver. Some disadvantages include the requirement of monitoring in an area that has cell phone coverage, monthly service fees, and the possibility of the cell phone service provider changing cell towers or communication protocols, thereby effecting communications to your remote locations. =Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT)= Pop-up satellite archival tags are electronic storage devices developed in the late 1990s that are either surgically implanted or attached to the outside of marine animals with an anchoring device. These tags can record data on ambient light levels, swimming depth, and internal/external temperature. PSAT's transmit recorded information to an orbiting satellite which then relays the information to researchers. At a preset time, a signal causes the tag's attachment to the organism to dissolve, allowing the tag to float to the surface of the water where it sends its data via satellite. Although PSAT's are more expensive than other tags, they are effective for studying the movements of large pelagic animals that are often not recaptured. Data from PSAT's has been used to determine horizontal and vertical movement patterns, residence times, feeding bouts, and possible spawning areas.Block, B. A., H. Dewar, C. Farwell, and E. D. Prince. 1998. A new satellite technology for tracking the move- ments of Atlantic bluefin tuna. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA 95:9384‚Äì9389. White shark tagged below the dorsal fin with a pop-up satellite tag. =Genetic markers= A genetic marker is a gene or DNA sequence with a known location on a chromosome that can be used to identify individuals or species. The marker could be a short DNA sequence, such as a sequence surrounding a single base-pair change, known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), or a longer minisatellite sequence. A small sample of blood, a feather, or piece of tissue, can be extracted from an organism and its unique genetic markers are determined. If the organism is recaptured or a sample is obtained at a later date, then it is possible to determine if it was the same organism as in the initial capture. Having proper bioinformatics tools is essential for processing and analyzing DNA sequence data. Many important developments during the 1990s have made tracking wildlife using genetic markers possible, including: # the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which can amplify small amounts of DNA to make a large usable amount. # the development and use of evolutionarily conserved sets of PCR primers. # the use of microsatellite loci that vary among individuals within a species, and between species. # the development of advanced DNA sequencing techniques. 2000s =Nanotechnology= Many things utilized for studying larger organisms has not been possible for smaller organisms due to size constraints on technology. In marine environments, tracking devices on smaller organisms are too heavy causing them to behave unnaturally. Recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed scientists to track millimeter sized organisms. Small organisms can be labelled with quantum dots, a microscopic fluorescent probe, the core of which is a semiconductor material with high photostability, high wavelength absorption range, and a narrow emission wavelength range. In one experiment,Lard M, B√§ckman J, Yakovleva M, Danielsson B, Hansson LA. 2010. Tracking the Small with the Smallest ‚Äì Using Nanotechnology in Tracking Zooplankton. PLoS ONE 5(10): e13516. amine proteins on the exoskeleton of Daphnia magna were biotinylated and streptavidin was attached to the quantum dots. This allowed for a simple bioconjugation to tag the organisms with the quantum dots, by taking advantage of the high affinity interaction between streptavidin and biotin. D. magna individuals were successfully tracked with each having a unique quantum dot that fluoresced and emitted light of a specific wavelength that could be detected using cameras. The tags were useful for up to 24 hours, after which the organisms shed their carapace containing the quantum dot. Better cameras are being developed that will improve the depth at which the quantum dot- tagged organisms can be observed and allow for studies to be conducted in natural environments. Future tracking With continued technological innovation, future applications of telemetry will likely provide insights that are currently unavailable. Improvements in battery technology, combined with continued miniaturization of transmitter components, will likely reduce transmitter size further, while increasing efficiency and extending either detection range or tag life. As transmitter circuitry becomes more efficient, surplus battery power can be used to power sensors, so that a common practice of future studies will be to study not only the movement and behaviour of tagged fish but also to simultaneously collect information on the environment fish use. This will lead to more comprehensive multidiscipline studies addressing behaviour, biology, and ecology. In the future, technological advances may eventually lead to a transmitter capable of following the movements and behaviour of individuals throughout their life cycle.Adams, Noah S., John W. Beeman, and John H. Eiler. Telemetry Techniques: A User Guide for Fisheries Research. Bethesda, MD: American Fisheries Society, 2012.

History Lake Ballinger was originally called Lake McAleer after Hugh McAleer, its first owner. McAleer was a logger and the proprietor of much of the land surrounding the lake. One Bartholomew family had a homestead on the island beginning in 1888, until the 1901 purchase of the land by Richard A. Ballinger. Ballinger renamed the lake after his father, a Civil War veteran.

In 1972, Lake Ballinger was found to have the poorest water quality out of 34 Puget Sound area lakes that were surveyed for quality. One of the most significant problems contributing to its poor state was algae growth arising from phosphorus pollution, which resulted in hypoxia. In the following decades, a series of steps were taken to mitigate water quality issues. In 1980, sedimentation ponds were built along Hall Creek to allow some of the pollutants destined for the lake to settle. Two years later, a hypolimnetic aeration system was installed to introduce oxygen from the air to the lower strata of the lake. In 1991, Mountlake Terrace received approval to treat the water with alum to reduce nutrient levels. Lake Ballinger experienced a major flood of over six feet above its normal elevation on New Year's Day 1997, damaging several waterfront homes.

It involves a careful, detailed representation of a living space, without any people. These paintings were generally rendered as watercolors and required great technical mastery, if little creativity. By the mid-20th century, although such scenes were still being created, photography had changed this style of painting into a form of intentional archaism. Birth of the genre The interior portrait should not be confused with what is called a \\"conversation piece\\" in England; a term which designates a scene with a group of people engaged in some activity and often placed outdoors. The true interior piece shows only the room and decor, although previous activity may be suggested by the placement of articles in the room. This type of scene first appears near the end of the 17th century. At that time, the intent was entirely descriptive. They were usually done specifically to show the contents of an art gallery, personal library or cabinet of curiosities. One of the first known examples depicts the library of Samuel Pepys in London, dating from 1693. They are still valued today by researchers and decorators. In the case of Pepys, it can be seen, firsthand, how a scholar of that time arranges his books in a bookcase (an innovation at that time), uses a lectern, places cushions for his comfort, hangs maps, etc. Library project, c.1700. Engraving by Johann Boxbarth (fl.1690‚Äì1710) It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that a new type of interior portrait with a different intent made its appearance. This type first arose in architectural firms and was done for the benefit of their clients. Great architects such as the James Adam and his brother Robert Adam of Scotland and Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer would execute watercolors of their previous projects to entice prospective customers. This created a fad among the wealthy and the nobility to commission paintings of their own rooms, to show off and preserve for posterity. These paintings were often compiled into albums. This craze was particularly prevalent in England. From there, it spread widely throughout Europe. Apogee in the 19th century The psychological dimensions of d√©cor: interior portrait by Leopold Zielcke (1791‚Äì1861). Berlin, 1825 The first historically important example of the interior portrait represents a small art gallery set up by the Empress Josephine at Malmaison in 1812. In this watercolor by Auguste-Sim√©on Garneray, we can see her harp, art collection and her shawl, left on an armchair. Thus a new element appears: the psychological elements of the d√©cor and a palpable human presence. One can feel the owner's emotions and thoughts. In this sense, the paintings have truly become \\"portraits\\".An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration, From Pompeii to Art Nouveau by Mario Praz, Thames & Hudson, The \\"petit salon rouge\\" at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, by Luigi Premazzi (c.1855) The immense popularity of these paintings in the 19th century can be explained by many factors. Among the nouveau-riche and the bourgeoisie, great importance was given to the home as a place of comfort, intimacy and family. This period also saw a specialization (e.g. separate dining rooms) that were once known only to the very wealthy. These new \\"middle-classes\\" were also eager to copy aristocratic tastes and industrialization made a much wider variety of furniture easily affordable. Finally, decorative styles were constantly being changed and resurrected, so interior portraits were a way of preserving one's memories and bequeathing them to the next generation.Exhibition Archive: House Proud, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York Queen Victoria was very fond of these portraits as they allowed her to give the public a look at her loving family life and the comforts of home in a tasteful manner.La derni√®re reine : Victoria, 1819-1901 by Philippe Alexandre and B√©atrix de l'Aulnoit, Robert Laffont, Paris 2000, The craze was thereby spread throughout the Royal Families of Europe. Due to the number of lavishly decorated palaces they possessed (The Winter Palace, Tsarskoye Selo, Gatchina Palace, Peterhof Palace, Pavlovsk Palace...), the Tsars were among the most enthusiastic commissioners of interior portraits. Virtually all of their rooms (except the most private ones) were rendered at least once; some several times. These watercolors are considered to be among the best of their genre.in Vues des palais imp√©riaux des environs de Saint-Petersbourg, collected under the direction of Emmanuel Ducamp, edited by Alain de Gourcuff, Paris 1992, Speciality artists Salon of the Palazzo Barbaro, Venice. Ludwig Passini (1855) Ferdinand Rothbart, Coburg 1848 At a time when every cultured young woman learned to paint watercolors, many painted their own rooms or the ones where they were given their lessons. Most of the surviving examples are anonymous and rarely of high quality, but they often have a charm that compensates for what they lack in technical expertise.Charlotte Gere, L'√©poque et son style, la d√©coration int√©rieure au XIXe si√®cle, Flammarion, Paris 1989, Peter Thornton, Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1986, However, some members of the aristocracy had real talent, verging on the professional. The Polish Count Artur Potocki, for example, travelled widely, painting watercolors of the hotel rooms and other places where he stayed, from Rome to London. Nevertheless, virtually all the highest- quality works were produced by professionals with exceptional virtuosity in watercolors and a mastery of perspective...especially conical perspective, with two or three vanishing points, which produces an eerily photographic effect for modern eyes. With only a few exceptions, such as Jean-Baptiste Isabey and Eug√®ne Lami of France, architect John Nash and furniture-maker Thomas Sheraton (both of England), few artists who dealt exclusively with these portraits are still familiar today. Among some notable artists who produced them, not previously mentioned: * In England: William Henry Hunt, Mary Ellen Best, William Henry Pyne. * In France: Charles Percier, Adrien Dauzats. * In Germany: Ferdinand Rothbart, Rudolf von Alt, Eduard Gaertner. * In Russia: Eduard Hau, Vasily Sadovnikov, Konstantin Ukhtomsky, Grigory Chernetsov, Nikanor Chernetsov (his brother), Alexander Brullov, Karl Brullov (his brother), Pyotr Sokolov, Orest Kiprensky, Alexey Venetsianov. * In Poland, Aleksander Gryglewski.

Green Lake has three recognizable sections. \\"Little Green\\" is on the north end of the body of water. The main and biggest portion is in the middle. The south end has many bays and vegetation. Development The shoreline of Green Lake is very developed. It has approximately 335 homes and one regional park. The regional park located on Green Lake is Camp Ojiketa. This park is of trees, trails and a few cabins available for rent. It is the newest and largest park in Chisago City. Ojiketa used to be a Camp Fire Girls camp, but is now a venue that can be rented out for weddings, family gatherings, or other events. Fishing Green Lake specializes in walleye, bluegill, and crappie. Other common fish that are found in this lake are lake sturgeon, largemouth bass, and northern pike. Every year, Green Lake hosts a carp festival in which members of the contest go out late at night to catch as many carp as they can. Green Lake also hosts a bass tournament during Chisago City's annual \\"Ki-Chi-Saga Days\\" festival. There are many different kinds of fish that can be found in Green Lake.

According to the DNR, \\"walleye management includes annual fingerling stocking at a rate of one pound per littoral acre () and a minimum harvest regulation. Walleye abundance is within the normal range for this lake type, although survey gill net catch rates have decreased since peaking in 1986. A recent management change from biennial to annual fingerling stocking may help to boost walleye numbers; however, yellow perch, an important prey for walleye, have been declining as well.

CRJ was formed through the merger of several older organizations in the Boston and New England area, and while most of its work today is focused in the northeastern United States, CRJ is also engaged in work in other states around the nation.  History  Community Resources for Justice, CRJ, represents the long evolution of criminal justice organizations in Massachusetts. The oldest organization in CRJ's history, the New England Society for the Suppression of Vice (NESSV), began in 1878 and worked to create legislation that influence public morality and dissuade crime. The NESSV went through a number of name changes as it took on more goals: in 1891 it was renamed the New England Watch and Ward Society following its new focus on organized crime in the Boston area. In 1957, that became the New England Citizens Crime Commission, focusing further on specific organized crimes groups In 1967 the NECCC turned back to crime prevention under the name Massachusetts Council on Crime and Correction. Shortly after the NESSV began, a parallel organization, the Massachusetts Prison Association, was founded in 1889. It focused on providing temporary amenities for recently released criminals. In 1937, it broadened scope to provide emergency services to the previously incarcerated. The Massachusetts Prison Association continued to merge with other corrections societies such as the John Howard Society and the Friends of Prisoners in 1940. Following a loss of funding in 1975, these two larger organizations, the Massachusetts Council on Crime and Correction and the Massachusetts Correctional Association, merged to become the Crime and Justice Foundation. The group‚Äôs current name, Community Resources for Justice (CRJ), was created in 1999 after merging with MHHI. Today, the organization provides services to ex‚Äìoffenders to re‚Äìintegrate them into society, and reforming the criminal justice system through public policy development while simultaneously pushing for legislation aiding adults with intellectual disabilities and troubled youth.Medal, Dominique. \\"Historical Note.\\" Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: Community Resources for Justice Records. Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, July 2013. Web. Accessed 03 March 2014. Activities Community Resources for Justice provides services to ex‚Äìoffenders to re‚Äìintegrate them into society while also working to reform the criminal justice system through public policy development. CRJ also provides services to adults with intellectual disabilities. CRJ operates group homes, halfway houses, and youth residential facilities in three states. CRJ's policy work is partially accomplished through its research arm, The Crime and Justice Institute. The Institute collaborates with both regional and national organizations to conduct research and write policy briefs to further inform both scholarly research and public policy. Recent Work In 2001, CRJ released a study that showed that corrections overhauls from the late 1980s stripped the focus on rehabilitation from prison life, leaving prisoners unfit to be released. The study states that 62 percent of former state prison inmates will be rearrested within three years of release.Klein, Rick.

Soteria was also an epithet of the goddess Persephone, meaning deliverance and safety. Soteria's male counterpart was the spirit or daimon Soter. Both Zeus and Dionysus were titled Soter, so either may have been her father; her mother is unknown. She had a sanctuary and a statue made in her honor in the town of Patrae, which was believed to have been founded by Eurypylos of Thessaly. Various texts mention the creation of her sanctuary, for example: * Pausanias, Description of Greece 7. 24. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue 2nd century AD): \\"[In Aigion in Akhaia (Aegium in Achaea)] they also have a sanctuary of Soteria (Safety). Her image may be seen by none but the priests, and the following ritual is performed. They take cakes of the district from the goddess and throw them into the sea, saying that they send them to Arethousa at Syrakousa (Syracuse).\\" * Pausanias, Description of Greece 7. 19. 7 & 21\\\\. 7: \\"Eurypylos [the hero of the Trojan War] opened the chest [containing a sacred idol of Dionysos], saw the image, and forthwith on seeing it went mad. He continued to be insane for the greater part of the time, with rare lucid intervals ... There is a sanctuary [in Patrai in Akhaia (Patrae in Achaea)] with an image of stone. It is called the sanctuary of Soteria (Deliverance), and the story is that it was originally founded by Eurypylos on being cured of his madness.\\" * Ovid, Fasti 3. 879 ff (trans. Boyle) (Roman poetry 1st century BC to 1st century AD): \\"March 30 Comitialis. When the shepherd feeds and pens his kids four more times and the grasslands whiten with four fresh dews, Janus should be worshipped and gentle Concordia (Concord), Salus Romana (Safety of Rome) and the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace).\\" Soteria was depicted as a woman wearing a laurel wreath crown, a symbol of victory. In Roman mythology, Soteria is known as Salus (Preservation); however, Salus's domain more heavily featured physical well-being and health rather than security and safety. The Bible's use of Soteria indicates its etymology from Greek mythology, as the word is used to mean \\"fourfold salvation: saved from the penalty, power, presence and most importantly the pleasure of sin.\\" See also * (Goddesses of Justice): Astraea, Dike, Themis, Prudentia * (Goddesses of Injustice): Adikia * (Aspects of Justice): (see also: Triple deity/Triple Goddess (neopaganism)) ** (Justice) Themis/Dike/Justitia (Lady Justice), Raguel (the Angel of Justice) ** (Retribution) Nemesis/Rhamnousia/Rhamnusia/Adrasteia/Adrestia/Invidia ** (Redemption) Eleos/Soteria/Clementia, Zadkiel/Zachariel (the Angel of Mercy) References Category:Greek deities Category:Personifications in Greek mythology Category:Epithets of Persephone ","title":"Soteria (mythology)"},{"id":"42308010","title":"Dirt Road Communion"},{"id":"42308024","text":"Sir Nicholas de Loveyne (died 24 September 1375) was a major English property owner and courtier, who held a number of senior positions in the service of King Edward III. Background The parentage of Sir Nicholas de Loveyne (Lovayne/Lovaine/Lovain/Louveyne) has not been firmly established. There is evidence that suggests he may have been a son of Sir Thomas de Loveyne, whose own father Sir Matthew de Loveyne held land in Little Easton, Essex in 1300. Writing at the end of the 18th century, Edward Hasted stated that Nicholas \\"was a descendant of the noble family of Lovaine, a younger branch of the duke of Lorraine. Godfrey de Lovaine, having that surname from the place of his birth, possessed lands in England in right of his mother, grand daughter of king Stephen.\\" He married twice, both of his wives having the Christian name Margaret. This has been one reason for confusion about his marriages and the associated relatives, a subject that is comprehensively discussed with extensive reference to original sources in two articles by Walter Lee Sheppard Jr. Accounts of the activities of Nicholas and his relations appear in numerous other printed and online publications. Amongst the former is a substantial proportion of \\"Godstone: a parish history\\". However, this book was written before some of its conclusions were challenged by Walter Lee Sheppard's articles. First Marriage Sir Nicholas‚Äô first wife was Margaret, daughter of John de Bereford, a citizen of London, and widow of Sir John de Pulteney, who died on 8 June 1349.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 9, No. 183. Margaret's marriage to Nicholas evidently took place between that date and 1 September 1350.Calendar of Close Rolls, (1349-54), page 249. On 12 October of the same year Nicholas obtained custody of the lands and marriage of William de Pulteney, the son and heir of Margaret's first husband.Calendar of Patent Rolls (1348-50), page 577. William de Pulteney died on 20 January 1366/7 and it appears from the evidence given at an inquisition post mortem held on 2 July 1367 that his mother was still alive on the latter day.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 12, No. 162. There is no definite evidence of any children from Nicholas‚Äô first marriage. However, it is possible that one ‚ÄúGuy de Loveyne‚Äù who on 22 April 1365 was included in an indenture that entailed much of the de Pulteney estates and who does not appear to be recorded subsequently may have been a child of that marriage who presumably died young.Calendar of Close Rolls (1364-8), pages 394-6. Second Marriage and family Nicholas married Margaret de Vere, the widow of Henry de Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont, who had died on 25 July 1369.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 12, No. 321. Margaret was a daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford and his wife Maud de Badlesmere. The marriage must have taken place without royal consent, as on 9 May 1375 a pardon was granted to the couple for Margaret having married without the King's licence.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 16 (1374-7), page 98. Nicholas and Margaret's son Nicholas was described as aged ‚Äú5 years and more‚Äù in 1375,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 14, No. 172. but as late as 26 October 1369 Margaret had not yet remarried,Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 13, 1369-1374, pages 62-3. indicating that the marriage of Nicholas and Margaret took place at the end of 1369 or early in 1370. Nicholas and Margaret had two children: * Nicholas de Loveyne (born c.1370) * Margaret de Loveyne (c.1372-1408) Career On 1 June 1349, Nicholas de Loveyne was described as a King's yeoman when he was granted custody of the lands of Margaret, daughter of William de Hardeshull along with control of her marriage.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 8 (1348-50), page 331. It is likely, but not clear to what extent, that Nicholas was personally involved in the warfare between England and France which included the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and the Reims campaign in 1359-60. He is recorded on 13 September 1360 as crossing the Channel with letters from the Black Prince to Edward III. On 8 June 1361, Edward III granted him an annuity of ¬£50 ‚Äúfor long service‚Äù.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 12 (1361-4), page 27. Nicholas' role in the Black Prince's household was rewarded in 1361 by a payment of ¬£26.13s.4d and also an income of 100 marks per year for life. In the following year, the Black Prince provided Nicholas with a further gift of ¬£20. An indication of the close connection between Nicholas and the Black Prince is that Sir Nicholas de Lovayne was one of five witnesses recorded by name who were present at the formal engagement of the Black Prince and Joan, Countess of Kent which took place at the chapel of Lambeth Palace on 6 October 1361, four days before the wedding itself. Between July 1361 and August 1363, Sir Nicholas de Loveyne, ‚Äúknight of the King‚Äôs chamber‚Äù, was serving as ambassador to the Holy See of the King, Queen and Prince of Wales. This was during that period when the popes resided at Avignon, those in office whilst Sir Nicholas was there being Innocent VI and Urban V. It appears from the surviving records that much of Nicholas‚Äô work involved promoting the King's case for the appointment of particular individuals to ecclesiastical positions in cases where papal approval was required. It was as a result of Nicholas' representations that Urban V agreed in November 1363 to the presentment of William of Wykeham to the archdeaconry of Lincoln. On 26 June 1364, Nicholas was appointed steward of the lordships of Ponthieu and Montreil, for which he was paid 200 marks a year.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 12 (1364-8), page 15. On 19 July 1364, the King ratified an appointment for life that had been made by Queen Philippa of Nicholas de Lovaigne as constable and porter of Pevensey Castle.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 13 (1364-7), page 9. On 17 November 1367, Nicholas was granted a licence to cross overseas from the port of Dover to the King's lordship of Ponthieu, where he was governor, with his own money and harness as well as ten horses and ten men.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 14 (1367-70), page 71. The letters of protection and letters of attorney that survive from 1369 onwards indicate at least some of the points at which Nicholas went abroad in the latter part of his life. They were issued in connection with departures to France in February 1369 and October 1371, naval service in July and August 1372 and again to France in March and April 1375. On each occasion he was to serve as a man-at-arms. Property Many of Nicholas‚Äô property holdings are included in the list that follows. However, it may not be complete and not all of the properties were necessarily held at the same time.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 14 (1367-1370), page 434.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward III (1369-1374), Vol. 13, pages 182-185.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 16 (1374-1377), pages 107-9, 111 & 201.

Nicholas' property holdings were not confined to England. In November 1366, orders were given to the viscount of Pois, John de Boberche, the lord of Crezeques and Louc, and five others to complete the purchase of lands granted by Edward III to Sir Nicholas de Loveyne.  Death  Sir Nicholas died on 24 September 1375.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 16, No. 172. His will was made at Poplar four days earlier and directed that he be buried in the parish church of Penshurst or in the Abbey of St Mary of Graces. The will was proved on 25 November 1375. As Nicholas held the manor of Poplar and made his will there shortly before his death, it is likely that he died in Poplar manor house which at that time stood on land at the top of a lane from Poplar High Street on the present line of Wade's Place. Evidently, he was buried at The Abbey of St. Mary de Graces, as a contract was entered into for Henry Lakenham, a London marbler, to construct his tomb there. This included a military effigy in freestone, resting on a table tomb comprising a marble plinth, a chest of marble ashlar with eight brass shields and a ledger slab with inscription. The monument was still in place in 1533 but presumably destroyed along with the abbey buildings after its dissolution in 1538. A large-scale excavation of the site of the abbey took place in 1983-8. An analysis of the archaeological and documentary evidence uncovered has been published by the Museum of London.

The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. Wb, the distributed whiteboard tool designed and implemented by McCanne and Jacobson, is the first application based on the Scalable Reliable Multicast framework. Overview Scalable Reliable Multicast is heavily based on the group delivery model that is the centerpiece of the IP multicast protocol. It attempts to follow the core design principles of transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). It requires only the basic IP delivery model with possible duplication and reordering of packets and builds reliability on an end-to-end basis. The algorithms in Scalable Reliable Multicast dynamically adjust their control parameters based on the observed performance within a session like transmission control protocol adaptively setting timers or congestion control windows. Components It has three major components, multicast, reliability and scalability. =Multicast= It provides an efficient means to transmit data to multiple parties. A single copy of the packet travels down any given network link, and is duplicated at network branch points. =Reliability= It is based on loss detection and re-transmission policy. Since sender-oriented reliability may lead to ACK implosion, it uses receiver-based reliability. It does not focus on any particular delivery order. =Scalability= This is an issue in many reliable multicast protocols because of state explosion and message implosion effect. Scalable Reliable Multicast uses various approaches like polling, hierarchy, suppression, etc, to achieve scalability.

It has been a major export article from Somalia since ancient times, and is called hebbakhade, habaghadi or habak hadi in Somali. It is an important ingredient in perfumery and therefore known as scented myrrh, perfumed myrrh or perfumed bdellium.  Etymology  \\"Opopanax\\" originally refers to the gum resin from plants of the genus Opoponax which is used in herbal medicine rather than perfumery. In the early 20th century, the name \\"opopanax\\" was misapplied to bisabol in perfumery. Nowadays the true opopanax is seldom used and the commercial opopanax is almost exclusively bisabol. To distinguish bisabol from the true opoponax, it is often alternatively spelled opoponax, and sometimes referred to as the opopanax of perfumery or perfumery's opopanax.  Botanical origin  The true botanical origin of perfumery's opopanax is a tree native to Somalia and Ethiopia, Commiphora guidottii. It has been mistakenly believed that the opopanax of perfumery comes from another Commiphora species, C. kataf (syn. C. holtziana, C. erythraea), known as hagar in Somali, while the true bisabol tree C. guidottii is called hadi in Somali. The confusion between hadi and hagar is attributable to historical misidentification. The gum resin of hagar is sometimes sold under the name of opoponax due to the confusion, though its scent is distinctly different from the authentic opopanax of perfumery. The hagar gum resin has a subtle myrrh-like scent, whereas the opopanax of perfumery is strongly aromatic with a suspicion of turpentine. The opopanax of perfumery is not so bitter as the true myrrh (bitter myrrh, hirabol) and has a slightly aromatic taste, while the hagar gum resin is only slightly bitter with a suspicion of toffee. Probably because of their less bitter taste, they are both sold as sweet myrrh.  Uses  A resinoid is prepared from the gum resin by solvent extraction.

BBC Films is acting as sales agent and it was distributed by Universal Pictures. It was written by series creator (and company director of both That's Nice Films and Bocflix) Brendan O'Carroll, who also plays the lead role. The film sees Agnes Brown go to court to protect her family's stall at Dublin's Moore Street market from a corrupt Russian businessman who wishes to convert it into a shopping centre. The film was released on 27 June to negative reviews from critics. It topped the UK and Ireland box office with ¬£4.3 million in its opening weekend, on a budget of ¬£3.6 million, and retained top spot for a second week. On 27 October it was released on home media, again topping the charts. Plot Agnes Brown (Brendan O'Carroll) is an independent market trader, selling fruit and vegetables on Dublin's Moore Street market. It has been under attack from P.R. Irwin (Dermot Crowley), a TD (PRIC) who is in an arrangement with a ruthless Russian businessman who wants to put all the market stalls out of business and open a shopping centre on the site. Her stall is the next to be targeted, being sent a bill for unpaid tax left by her grandmother, and a man (working for Irwin) appears offering to buy her stall and make the bill disappear. Agnes nearly accepts, but Winnie (Eilish O'Carroll) reveals this news to the locals, forcing Agnes into defending her stall from the developers while they look for ideas on how to raise the money. Agnes' friend Philomena Nine Warts informs her that her grandmother, Mary Moccasin, was next to Agnes' grandmother at the tax office when she paid the bill and therefore no money is owed. Unfortunately Philomena's grandmother is hit by a bus on the way to the courtroom before she can testify. Agnes' court case attracts a lot of attention from the media, portraying her as the greatest mother in Ireland. This leads her to go to confession, where she admits (unknowingly also to a Russian mobster) that she briefly put her children in care when her husband died, but continued to claim the child support money. This is used against her in the witness box during questioning by Irwin in court (Irwin being the opposing Barrister), and she runs out in shame. Eventually being found by the river by her daughter Cathy (Jennifer Gibney), she admits all in a tearful moment on the Ha'penny Bridge, telling her how she told the nuns that she thought she could look after two of the six children, but when asked to pick she was unable to. Meanwhile, Agnes' son Dermot (Paddy Houlihan) and his lifelong criminal best friend Buster Brady (Danny O'Carroll) try to get the receipt. After failing to break into the restricted area of the NRS they recruit a troop of blind trainee ninjas, led by Mr. Wang (also played by Brendan O'Carroll). The Russians have already found and destroyed the original receipt, but Buster and Dermot learn the receptionist that took the payment was blind, so that there exists a braille version of the receipt. They find it and let Agnes know, telling her Tourettes-suffering barrister (Robert Bathurst) to stall the case. After navigating air ducts out of the NRS, Agnes, Buster and Dermot are chased by the mobsters and the Garda, jumping in the River Liffey. Agnes separates from the pair and returns with the \\"receipt\\" but it turns out Buster accidentally gave her a betting slip instead. At this point Cathy stands up and gives a speech on how special Moore Street and its market is, and her intention to run her mother's stall when her time comes, to Agnes' joy. After their pursuit continues in a Nissan Navara and finally a dash on a stolen horse, Buster and Dermot deliver the receipt to the court room just in time to have the case against Agnes dropped. They all celebrate by dancing on the steps of the courtroom.

A spokesman for O'Carroll said that the film would have a distinctly Dublin flavour, \\"It's Dublin humour so you're going to need Dublin actors and technicians to get it right for the big screen.\\" Despite funding being secured, O'Carroll later confirmed that a script had not been written prior to the deal. \\"I haven't written it yet. That's what success does, they give you money and say 'Whatever you think'. So I've taken the money!\\". At the 2013 National Television Awards O'Carroll confirmed the film had been written and would begin shooting the following autumn. Principal photography began in September 2013 in Dublin. Filming locations included Moore Street, Dublin quays, Dublin Institute of Technology, Father Matthew Square, The Customs House and Wimbledon Studios. Filming was completed on 25 October 2013. The Script recorded a song for the film called \\"Hail, Rain or Sunshine\\". Release The film had its world premiere on 25 June 2014 at the Savoy Cinema in Dublin, with Brendan O'Carroll and the rest of the cast in attendance. The distributors of the film did not screen the film for critics in advance of its release. Reception =Box office= The film earned ¬£4.3 million in the UK and Ireland in its opening weekend, breaking records in Ireland for the highest box office gross on the opening day of an Irish-made film. It was top of the UK and Ireland box office in this opening weekend, ahead of The Fault in Our Stars which took ¬£1.7 million. It maintained its No. 1 spot for a second week, in which it grossed another ¬£2.1 million, the only film to pass ¬£1 million that week. For its third week, it took ¬£1.08 million, but fell to third behind Transformers: Age of Extinction and How to Train Your Dragon 2. With a total gross of ¬£14.7 million, it was the third highest grossing British or Irish film in the domestic market in 2014, behind The Inbetweeners 2 and Paddington. =Critical response= The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 6% based on reviews from 16 critics, with an average rating of 3.09/10. Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave the film 1 star out of 5 and called it \\"a flatly indifferent cash-in\\". He predicted that although the devoted fanbase of the sitcom would make it as much of a commercial success as The Inbetweeners Movie, it did not deserve to be. In The Daily Telegraph, writer Robbie Collin also gave the film 1 star out of 5. He was highly critical of the Chinese character Mr Wang, played by O'Carroll \\"with his eyes narrowed and Ls and Rs switched, while making little karate-choppy motions in the air with his hands\\", calling it \\"something close to anti-funny\\". He also said that the sitcom's inclusion of bloopers and characters breaking the fourth wall didn't translate to the format of cinema without \\"very clever lateral thinking\\", which the film lacked. Donald Clarke of The Irish Times called the film \\"overstretched, underwritten, sluggishly paced and unsettled by the discombobulating move from studio to location\\" and concluded, \\"the gags are clunky, the dialogue is leaden and the story is threadbare.\\" Another 1-star review came from Empire, who remarked: \\"almost avant-garde in its commitment to unfunny, it's shambolically performed by the majority of its cast, and shot and edited in a fashion so slapdash it seems like a movie made almost entirely by competition winners.\\" Stephen Kelly of Total Film also gave the film 1 star out of 5 and said that it will \\"leave even the most fervent of fans disappointed by its abattoir of wit\\" because \\"while the TV show possesses a warm, ramshackle appeal, this story of granny Agnes Brown trying to save a Dublin market from d'foreigners (boo!) is not only out of its comfort zone, but full of cold, mean-spirited gags about the blind, an Indian man everyone thinks is Jamaican (um, LOL?) and [a] Chinese caricature so dazzlingly racist it beggars belief.\\" Mark Kermode gave the film a scathing review, calling it \\"an absolute stinker\\" and \\"not funny on any level, at all\\", saying that: \\"it's good that the cast [laugh at themselves in the bloopers] because were it not for the cast laughing at the jokes, there wouldn't be anybody laughing in the cinema... there are no laughs. None. Nul points. Nil.\\" Archie Bland of The Independent said that he \\"couldn't argue\\" with actor Rory Cowan who said that the views of critics were \\"totally irrelevant\\", but still found the film \\"dreadful... slow, sentimental, and altogether cynical\\", saying that \\"I'm afraid I can't say I laughed, or even smiled, once in the whole godforsaken 93 minutes.\\" He concluded by saying that \\"I don't see why anyone is obliged to like [the film] just because it does well at the box office... In any case, it doesn't really matter. It is now absolutely clear that Mrs Brown is a slating-proof juggernaut.\\" In one of the few positive reviews, James Ward of the Daily Mirror gave the film 4 stars out of 5. Though Ward enjoyed the 1970s-inspired politically-incorrect humour, he noted that some moments caused him to wince rather than laugh, saying the ninja character \\"makes Benny Hill's Chinaman seem sensitive and respectful\\". Ward concludes: \\"Old-fashioned? Undoubtedly. Crude? Definitely. Funny? Well, we know what the critics with their box sets of Curb Your Enthusiasm will say [...] For the critics D'Movie may be a D'Isaster ‚Äì but for the rest of us it's a D'Light\\". Sequel Brendan O'Carroll announced there would be a sequel to D'Movie at the National Television Awards in January 2014, whilst speaking to the Radio Times, O'Carroll said \\"We're already working on a sequel ‚Äì Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie 2\\". In December 2015 it was confirmed that there will be a sequel.https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/brendan-ocarroll-planning-mrs- browns-7039455 In August 2016 Brendan O'Carroll told The Sun that the sequel had been delayed because of Brexit. 'We were planning to do it this year but the numbers weren't right' said O'Carroll. 'The Brexit Drop in sterling makes it a lot more expensive for the studio than it would have been previously.' In December 2018, it was confirmed that O'Carroll would be writing a sequel with his son Danny, who plays Buster. The plot will revolve around the relationship between Buster and Dermot. 'I think it's going to be really, really successful' O'Carroll said of film and compared the chemistry between Buster and Dermot to that of Morcambe and Wise. Possible spin-offs On 20 June 2014, O'Carroll announced that he was working on two spin-off feature films following on from Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie. The first spin-off film is to be entitled Wash and Blow if it is produced and it will see O'Carroll take on the role of salon owner, Mario, alongside Rory Brown and Dino Doyle. The second spin-off film in development is to be entitled Mr Wang, who is a character introduced in D'Movie. It was confirmed that English actor Burt Kwouk, who later died in 2016, had been asked to take the title role but was unable to travel to Dublin, so O'Carroll will take on the role himself if the film gets produced. It will also co-star Buster Brady and Dermot Brown working for him under a detective agency. It is currently not known if the spin-off films will be made. Home media Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie was released on DVD and Blu- ray in the UK and Ireland on 27 October 2014. Within the first week of release in the UK, the film sold 315,981 units across DVD, Blu-ray and digital downloads, topping the home entertainment charts with nearly twice as many sold as second-placed Godzilla. O'Carroll said \\"I'm always surprised, to this day, about how much people love the show and have embraced it into their lives and their homes. We never take it for granted and always just aim to make the audience and fans laugh out loud in everything we do.\\" See also * List of 2014 box office number-one films in the United Kingdom *Madea References  External links  Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie at BBC Films * Category:Mrs. Brown's Boys Category:2014 films Category:English-language films Category:BBC Films films Category:2010s musical comedy films Category:Irish musical comedy films Category:Films based on television series Category:Films set in Dublin (city) Category:Irish films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:2014 comedy films ","title":"Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie"},{"id":"42308181","text":"Prem Prakash Pandey (born 8 March 1958) is an Indian politician who served as 2nd Speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly. He is a member of Bharatiya Janata Party and was Cabinet Minister in Raman Singh's Government. He is one of the architects of Chhattisgarh which was formed in 2000 after the bifurcation of Madhya Pradesh. As a compliment to his efficiency and grasp on the political aspect, he was chosen for the distinguished post of the Speaker of the 2nd Legislative Assembly of Chhattisgarh. He was also a Minister in Government of unpartitioned Madhya Pradesh. http://cgvidhansabha.gov.in/hindi_new/mla_biodata_4th/65.pdf  Early life  Prem Prakash Pandey was born on 8 March 1958 in Bhurwar, Thana-Bankata, District- Deoria, Uttar Pradesh. Mr Pandey hailed from a typical Indian Middle-class family- father was a service holder in Bhilai Steel Plant and mother as a home maker. He was 11 years younger than the Independent India, but was more worried and affected by the growth and political development in India. The gory emergence of NAxalite in the country and in his state had an indelible impact on him. Many other local and national occurrences affected him subconsciously and chiselled him, in later years, to contribute actively in nation-building.  Political Life  Prem Prakash Pandey began his political career in 1976 when he was pursuing education. One major political crisis which triggered his zeal to serve the nation was when India was reeling under the attack on Democracy in the garb of Emergency in 1975. He was imbued especially by Atalji during this phase. His first step into politics was when he decided to join Akhil Bharthi Vidhyarthi Parishad.He took this decision when he was only in Class 11. This very well exemplifies his deep conviction and commitment towards serving public and solving their maladies. In 1976, he officially joined politics in Pandit Ravishankar Shukla University. He gradually moved the ladder up with his grit and determination. In 1990, he won the first election and was entrusted with the charge of Minister of Education, Skill Development and Technical Education in undivided Madhya Pradesh. In 1993, he became an Elected Member of Legislative Assembly and later in 1995, he was elected as Executive Member of BJP Yuva Morcha. A commendable milestone that he earned was to be elected as the Speaker Of Chhattisgarh Vidhan Sabha, on 22 December 2003  Initiatives  He is leaving no stone unturned in unleashing progress and development in Bhilai. His activities are receiving support from the people. He wants the Youth to be empowered, practice positive developmental politics and be a conduit of Change. His campaigns such as #BaatBhilaiki received fervour with the locals of Bhilai. He is the only Minister in Chhattisgarh to initiate Facebook Live where people beforehand send their queries and their complaints were solved aftermath. He has exemplified his visionary attribute through his effort of solving the water woes of his constituency and earned the sobriquet like \\"Paaniwala Baba\\". He gave a new identity to Bhilai as he got IIT campus in Bhilai. It was the fruit of his persistent effort that Bhilai has become an educational hub. Akin to this, he is contemplating many other strategies to make Bhilai a smart as well as a city achieving sustainable growth = \\"Swacchata Utsav\\" = He also gave vigour to the \\"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\\" campaign in Bhilai to inculcate behavioural change and to keep the environment clean. Prem Prakash Pandey being the MLA of Bhilai constituency has started (on 28 August 2016) an initiative named \\"Swacchhata Utsav\\" under which he visits a part of the constituency every Sunday in the morning with a group of followers and volunteers, where Prem Prakash Pandey and volunteers clean the streets (though symbolically) to spread the message of cleanliness. The idea is to spread the word of \\"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\\" started by nation's prime minister Narendra Modi. It has now become a big 34 weeks long campaign which contributed significantly in improving Bhilai's cleanliness index.

Established in a former church building, the Belfry was the first summer stock theater in Wisconsin. The theater operated as a stock company from 1935 until 1969, providing early professional experience to thespians like Paul Newman, Del Close, Gary Burghoff and Harrison Ford. The venue continued operating for local productions for many years, for a short time as an adjunct to Cleveland's Dobama Theater. In 2016, The Belfry Music Theatre was renovated, and opened to the public as a music concert and event venue. Located on Bailey Road south of the intersection of highways 50 and 67, on what was once called Delap Corners, the Belfry produced seasonal productions from the early 1930s through the 1970s and sporadically thereafter. The non-profit company was a rural \\"straw hat\\" repertory troupe. The land was owned by the Delap family. They came from Chicago and settled in the Delavan area. It was housed in a converted church of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The church was erected in 1888 and adapted for theatrical purposes in the 1930s. The producing group called the Belfry Players first leased the building in 1934, then purchased it in 1938. A large shed was later added to the theater to provide space for scenic construction and storage. Nearby Crane Hall, more recently named Belfry House, served as a dormitory for resident company members. In the late 1960s, the Belfry Theater was imperiled by a highway widening project. Although the theater building was moved and its existence saved, the company's debts forced it to suspend production between 1969 and 1976. Barry E. Silverman, a director of the Dobama Theater of Cleveland, assumed proprietorship of the Belfry in 1976, dubbed his operating company \\"Dobama West,\\" and revived producing for three years, closing after the 1979 season. After regular annual productions ceased, \\"occasional revivals and performances were booked at the Belfry into the 1990s,\\" as, for example, when showman Eddie Cash presented musical tributes to popular singers.Carlson, Bob, Village Administrator, Williams Bay, email correspondence, March 27, 2014 - The Belfry was still producing as late as 1990. The theater buildings were purchased in November 2013 by Transformative Arts, Inc., a Christian theatrical production company. Players For most of its history, the Belfry acting company, a combination of local amateurs and a stipended resident corps of non-Equity actors, presented a summer series of six plays back to back, with a new production opening every two weeks. In the early days, actors who received pay were often required to spend hours constructing and painting settings and props in the scene shop. The company received financial support from its box office, from advertisers, and from dues-paying life members. Under Dobama West in the 1970s, the pay was scaled somewhat higher for actors to concentrate on just acting. Several well-known actors received their early career opportunities at the Belfry, including Paul Newman (1949), Del Close (1953), Gary Burghoff (1962), and Harrison Ford (1964). Among the company's resident directors were Leo M. Jones (1949), Lance Goss (1959, 1960), Frank C. Davidson (1951, 1961) and Keith Fowler (1962). Under the original Belfry management, actors often found the pace of the Belfry's repertory system‚Äîin which they rehearsed and worked in the scene shop all day and performed nearly every night‚Äîto be exhausting, but an effective form of training. Some took exception to the kind of learning the schedule imposed on them. Paul Newman remembered his Belfry rehearsals, saying \\"[T]he only thing you do ...in such a short time to prepare, is to develop your bad mannerisms, or discover possibly successful mannerisms--but mannerisms nevertheless. Sure, what can you do in four days of rehearsal? You can hope to Christ that you can remember your lines, and that‚Äôs about as far as it goes.‚ÄùNewman, Paul, quoted in Others felt the experience was valuable for teaching young actors what was necessary to make their characters' traits clear and to sell plots in many different styles to an audience. Productions As long as the Belfry's bell functioned, it was rung to announce the curtain time. Two plays were presented in the first season, 1934: The Youngest, followed by Laff That Off. Over the first few summers, the number of shows was gradually increased until a peak of eight productions was reached in 1938. By 1940, the count was stabilized at six titles per season through the early '60s, with only an occasional anomalous number. Most plays were typical summer escapist fare, such as comedies by No√´l Coward (Hay Fever) and George S. Kaufman (George Washington Slept Here) and light mysteries by Agatha Christie (Ten Little Indians). In the 1950s and '60s, Belfry occasionally attempted more serious fare by Arthur Miller (All My Sons), Tennessee Williams (The Glass Menagerie), and Peter Shaffer (Five Finger Exercise). Musicals (Babes in Arms, The Boy Friend) were added in the early 1960s.Program, p. 25 Under the Dobama West aegis, the number of musicals was increased, including as many as three in a season (1978): The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd; Side by Side by Sondheim; and Oklahoma!.

She currently skips the South Korean National Women's Curling Team on the World Curling Tour. Career Gim played as lead in her first world championship at the 2011 Capital One World Women's Curling Championship along with skip Kim Ji-sun. The team struggled finishing in last place with a 2-9 record. At the 2012 Ford World Women's Curling Championship, South Korea made history by winning the most games ever in history and made the playoffs for the first time. They eliminated Canada to advance to the semifinal, but lost a close game against eventual champions Switzerland. They then lost another close game to the Canadians in the bronze medal game, finishing in fourth place. Their fourth-place finish ensured them a spot in the 2014 Winter Olympics, even though South Korea did not qualify for the 2013 World Championships. At the Olympics, Gim played in the third and fourth positions, and the Korean team finished in eighth place with a 3‚Äì6 win-loss record. A month after the Olympics, Gim and her team represented South Korea at the 2014 World Women's Curling Championship in Saint John, New Brunswick. Like in 2012, the team had a successful run finishing round robin play with an 8-3 record and winning the tiebreaker 7-5 over Sweden's Margaretha Sigfridsson to qualify for the playoffs. They defeated Russia's Anna Sidorova in the 3 vs. 4 game but then lost the semi-final to, once again, Switzerland who went on to win the event. Gim missed her final shot of the Bronze Medal Game and the Russian's stole the win 7-6. The 2014-15 curling season was not a good season for the team. They won a World Curling Tour, the Crestwood Ladies Fall Classic but they didn't play in the 2014 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships and South Korea did not qualify for the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. The 2015-16 curling season was successful for the team. They won the Hub International Crown of Curling, finished second at the 2015 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships and qualified for the 2016 World Women's Curling Championship. Gim and her team struggled during the World's, finishing in seventh place with an 5-6 record. Gim finished off the season with a third place finish at the Korean National Championship. Gim played in a number of events in the 2016-17 curling season and made the playoffs in a few as well. The team finished second at the inaugural Hokkaido Bank Curling Classic, third at the Hub International Crown of Curling and the Medicine Hat Charity Classic and fifth at the Crestwood Ladies Fall Classic. They also won the Karuizawa International 7-4 over Margaretha Sigfridsson. For the 2017-18 curling season they didn't play as many events but still found success finishing runner-up at the Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic to Rachel Homan and qualifying for the quarterfinals at the Colonial Square Ladies Classic, Karuizawa International and the Glynhill Ladies International. The team had a full schedule for the 2018-19 curling season with more than ten events and qualifying for the playoffs in five of them. They finished runner-up at the Gord Carroll Curling Classic and even played in the 2018 Tour Challenge Tier 2, losing the quarterfinal game. In summer 2019, Team Gim would win the 2019 South Korean Curling Championship after stealing two in the tenth end of the final against Kim Min- ji.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHdXaedk7Dk To start their tour season, her team had a quarterfinal finish at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic. They followed this by missing the playoffs at the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard, a semifinal finish at the 2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic and winning the 2019 KW Fall Classic posting a perfect 7-0 record en route to capturing the title. They missed the playoffs at their next two events, the 2019 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic and the 2019 Canad Inns Women's Classic. At the 2019 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships, Gim and her team had a disappointing finish. After going 6-1 in the round robin, they lost the semi-final to China's Han Yu. This performance meant they didn't qualify Korea for the 2020 World Championship through the Pacific region and would have to play in the World Qualification Event for their spot in the World's. Next Team Gim competed in the 2019 Boundary Ford Curling Classic where they lost in the final to Kim Min-ji. Two weeks later, they played in the Jim Sullivan Curling Classic in Saint John, New Brunswick, the same city where the team had success in 2014 at the World's. It was another successful run for the rink as they went 7-0 through the tournament to capture the title. Gim's rink went undefeated at the World Qualification Event, going 7-0 in the round robin and defeating Italy in the 1 vs. 2 playoff game to qualify South Korea for the World Championship. The team was set to represent South Korea at the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship before the event got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Qualification Event would be their last event of the season as the remaining two events (the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events) were also cancelled due to the pandemic.

Huntington, which describes how chaos and disorder can arise from social modernization increasing more rapidly than political and institutional modernization. Huntington provides different definitions for political development and describes the forms of political decay according to the various definitions. Huntington focuses primarily on political development as modernization and institutionalization. However, he points to the different definitions of political development as being arbitrary ways to understanding the rise of political systems and the relationship between the political systems in different nations. Political development Huntington identifies two characteristics of political development. The first is that development is synonymous with modernization, thus political development can be defined as political modernization. The second is that there are many criteria to measure political development because modernization and development are such broad topics, covering many areas. There are four generally agreed-upon criteria to determine political development. The first is rationalization, which involves the movement from particularism to universalism, or, from a political standpoint, a focus on functional differentiation and achievement criteria. The second criterion is nationalism, and national integration. This emphasizes nation-states and nation-building as a key aspect of political development. The third criterion is a focus on democratization, which is in essence a focus on competition and equalization of power. The final criterion is mobilization, which is a focus on political participation. The greater the development, the greater the modernization, the greater the mobilization, and therefore the greater the political participation. Ultimately, political development can be defined as an increase in national political unity and an increase in political participation. =Modernization= According to Huntington's definition of political development as modernization, political decay is the opposite of the linear idea of social progress‚Äîalthough, within the model of modernization, social regression is not possible. Instead, political decay takes place because \\"modern and modernizing states can change by losing capabilities as well as by gaining them. In addition, a gain in any one capability usually involves costs in others.\\" The model of modernization was used to compare the political systems of different countries with social development reflecting the linear progression of political institutions. However, research into the relationship between development of political institutions and modernization has pointed to inconsistent development. In some political systems, such as certain Latin American regions, governments have been influenced by military intervention as a result of the government's inability to cope with the strains of modernization.Geller, Daniel S. \\"Economic Modernization and Political Instability: A Casual Analysis of Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism\\" The Western Political Quarterly 35, no. 1 (March 1982): 45 =Institutional= Under the framework of political development as institutional development, political decay occurs when institutions fail to change or adapt when they become unnecessary due to social or economic changes. Dan Halvorson challenges the idea of political decay as an institutional failure by claiming that the idea of political decay is tied to a Western ideal of political institution without taking into account widely-varying cultural institutions and the inability of post- colonial states to adapt to Western ideals.Halvorson, Dan. States of Disorder: Understanding State Failure and Intervention in the Periphery. Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2013. 19 Fukuyama refers to political decay as the social and economic forces that upset the equilibrium of established political order.Fukuyama, Francis, The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2011. 139. Institutions of the Roman Empire government failed to meet the moral and economic needs of the citizens, resulting in the conditions that would facilitate political decay and the fall of the Roman state.Boyd, James Harrington. \\"Permanence of the American Democracy\\" American Journal of Sociology 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 3 Under the institutional model, political decay can be observed as a decrease in competence and credibility and establishment of institutional corruption over a period of time.Young, Crawford. \\"Zaire: Is There a State?\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 18, no. 1 (1984): 80-82 Instability Different social and economic factors contribute to both the political development as well as the political decay of nations. Outside forces such as foreign governments affect the stability of established governments due to contrasting social institutions or economic interests. In order to be considered stable, government procedures and institutions must maintain autonomy and be resistant to outside agents. The social and economic forces that established political stability could change or disappear, leading to internal instability. Economic development, such as shifts from agriculture-based economy to manufacturing-based economy, as well as economic collapse, can also lead to political instability. Social developments, such as the proliferation of literacy, lead to the rise and spread of new ideas. =Political instability= Political instability occurs when one faction in a state's government is in opposition with another faction or with another institution in government. Sri Lanka saw a period of political instability following elections in 1994 caused by the ambitions of political leaders. The elected President Kumaratunga attempted to change the constitution and dissolve the parliament in order to remain in power, leading to sudden changes in the structure of the law-making body.DeVotta, Niel. \\"Sri Lanka in 2004: Enduring Political Decay and a Failing Peace Process.\\" Asian Survey 15, no. 1 (January/February 2005: 98-104 Political instability occurred during the late 18th century in France and other parts of Europe during the 19th century. Political development in France, such as the development of the bureaucracy and other institutions, led to a greater demand for meritocracy and greater political conflict among the ruling class.Gillis, John R. \\"Political Decay and the European Revolutions, 1789-1848.\\" World Politics 22, no. 3 (April 1970): 344-370. In some cases, political breakdown can occur within the framework of a state's constitution. India has provisions its constitution which grant leaders the power to breach or oppose the constitution in cases of emergency. These breaches of the state law from within the political system can lead to political decay.Hart, Henry C. \\"The Indian Constitution: Political Development and Decay.\\" Asian Survey 20, no. 4 (April 1980): 428-451 =Social developments= Huntington's model of political development and decay describes elements such as industrialization, urbanization, education and literacy as social developments that create instability. The presence of violent conflict is not always indicative of social decay. Due to the complex character of state-building and shifts in political systems, violence is not a reliable indicator of political decay or development.Cohen, Youssef, Brown, Brian R., Orgnaski, A.F.K. \\"The Paradoxical Nature of State Making: The Violent Creation of Order.\\" The American Political Science Review 75, no. 4 (December 1981): 901-910 The socialization of law is a process by which legislation is changed in order to adapt to economic and social changes. Socialization of law is one of the forces that opposes political decay within Huntington's structure of modernization, by ensuring that the political institutions in place are resistant to social instability.Boyd, James Harrington. \\"Permanence of the American Democracy.\\" American Journal of Sociology 30, no. 1 (July 1924): 1-21 Updated by Fukuyama Huntington's former student, Francis Fukuyama, has developed the theory of political decay by analysing the sclerosis of democratic institutions in the United States and elsewhere. The second of Fukuyama's two volumes on political order, Political Order and Political Decay (2014), echoes the title of Huntington's seminal 1965 essay. Fukuyama focuses on the concept of political decay in the framework of a history of the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties and the causes of political and social stability during each dynasty.

Evans has written three full-length novels. Her first novel, 26a, published in 2005, won the Orange Award for New Writers, the Betty Trask Award and the deciBel Writer of the Year award. Her third novel Ordinary People was shortlisted for the 2019 Women's Prize for Fiction and won the 2019 South Bank Sky Arts Award for Literature. Also a journalist, Evans has written for publications including Marie Claire, The Independent, The Observer, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, Time, The New York Review of Books and Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. Background and education Evans is the daughter of a Nigerian mother and an English father. She was born and grew up in Neasden, north-west London, with her parents and five sisters, one of whom was her twin. She also spent part of her childhood in Lagos, Nigeria. She completed a Media Studies degree at the University of Sussex. While in Brighton she was a dancer in the African dance troupe Mashango. She completed an MA in Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. At the age of 25 she became a journalist. She contributed human-interest features and art criticism to a range of magazines, journals and newspapers in the UK; published interviews with celebrities; worked as an editor for Pride Magazine and the literary journal Calabash. Writing Her first novel, 26a, \\"a Bildungsroman that centres its storyline on the growing process of a pair of identical twins of Nigerian-British origin, Georgia and Bessi\\" growing up in Neasden, was published in 2005 to wide critical acclaim and has since been translated into 12 languages.\\"Biography\\" , Diana Evans website. It was shortlisted in the first novel category for both the Whitbread Book Award and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, and was the inaugural winner of the Orange Award for New Writers. Literary critic Maya Jaggi said in The Guardian of 26a: \\"The writing is both mature and freshly perceptive, creating not only a warmly funny novel of a Neasden childhood [. . .] but a haunting account of the loss of innocence and mental disintegration.\\" Carol Birch, writing in The Independent, said of 26a that \\"Evans writes with tremendous verve and dash. Her ear for dialogue is superb, and she has wit and sharp perception\\" and though she has her criticisms, concludes that Evans \\"has produced a consistently readable book filled with likeable characters: a study of loss that has great heart and humour.\\" According to Diriye Osman in the Huffington Post: \\"Here was a Bildungsroman of such daring and sustained elegance that it felt like a gorgeous dance of a novel. In many ways, it is apropos that this book which focused on the secret bond that exists between twins was followed in 2009 by the equally masterful The Wonder, a novel rooted in the world of dance.\\"Osman, Diriye (13 January 2015), \\"The Delicate Lyricism of Diana Evans\\", Huffington Post. Evans' second novel, The Wonder (2009), explores the world of dancing in the context of Caribbean immigration to the UK, London gentrification, and the bond between father and son. Maggie Gee, writing in The Independent, called it \\"a serious work of art, with sentences like ribbons of silk winding around a skeleton of haunting imagery.. . . The Wonder‚Ä≤s most central achievement is to explore what art means in human life. [. . .] This second novel, both powerful and delicate, lacking in linear plot but rich in the poetry of human observation, proves that Evans has what she calls 'the watch-me, the grace note' that marks a true artist.\\" Her third novel, Ordinary People (2018), is a portrait of family life for two black couples in their 30s in South London in a year bookended by the election of Barack Obama and the death of Michael Jackson. Ordinary People was the winner of the South Bank Sky Arts Award and shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction, the Orwell Prize for Political Fiction and the Rathbones Folio Prize.

Early life Born in Tiverton in Devonshire, England, Land emigrated as a young man to the British Thirteen Colonies in America. He settled near Calkins Creek at what is now Milanville, Pennsylvania and started a farm. In 1756, he married Phoebe Scott. By 1776, Land had been appointed Justice of the Peace. Work during American Revolutionary War During the American Revolution, Land carried out many espionage missions for the British Army. He was eventually captured by American revolutionaries, tried and convicted as a traitor. Upon Land's release, he was wounded and chased by a gang of vigilantes, but managed to escape. Settlement of Hamilton, Ontario Returning to his Pennsylvania home, Land found that it had been destroyed. Believing that his wife and children were dead, Land decided to leave the colonies. He traveled through New York State to the Niagara River, which he crossed to what was then the British Province of Quebec. Once in Quebec, Land received a land grant of 312 acres, which now forms part of Hamilton. Several years later, Land was reunited with his family. Phoebe and her children had traveled for sanctuary to New York City, which was still under British occupation. At the end of the war, they and other Loyalists were evacuated by the Royal Navy to the British Colony of New Brunswick.Hamilton: A People's History by Bill Freeman, page 13 Seven years after arriving in New Brunswick, Phoebe heard a rumor about a man named Land who lived near Lake Ontario. Two years later, Phoebe and her children traveled to Quebec to reunite with Land. Later life When Land died in July 1818 at age of 79, Hamilton was developing into a village. Phoebe died in 1826 at age 93. Pheobe's youngest brother's son was the American general Winfield Scott who led a military incursion into Upper Canada in the War of 1812.

The term Vo√´lvry meant \\"outcast\\" or \\"free as a bird\\". This movement has been said to have started on April 4, 1989 in Johannesburg in a packed club. This marked the beginning of what some have called a rock and roll uprising. The Vo√´lvry movement used music in the Afrikaans language to show pride. The movement focused on Afrikaner youth. The main goal of the movement was to get Afrikaner youth to see the changes that had to occur in the ‚Äúauthoritarian, patriarchal culture‚Äù. History South Africa lived under Apartheid‚Äîthe separations of race enforced by law. The non-white race were barred from political office or even removed from the country. Uprising and protests increased in number and lead to major anti-apartheid movements. One of these movements, in 1989, was called the Vo√´lvry movement. The Vo√´lvry movement started in the 1980s with the opening of Shifty Mobile Recording Studio. Started by Lloyd Ross, this company began playing Afrikaans rock music, but it was too early for wide acceptance. Shifty Records asked three major questions when looking at music to accept: is it original? Does music have quality? And does it allow for growth in South Africa‚Äôs music development? This lead Ross to allow music that was angry and music that directly sang in response to Apartheid. Ross was quoted saying, ‚ÄúBut I am not a movement type of guy and never joined any political party or organization. What fascinated me was the culture coming out of it. That‚Äôs what I wanted to capture‚Äù. Ralph Rabie, under the stage name Johannes Kerkorrel, was a major force in the movement. Rabie used this name as a stage name to mock the Dutch Reformed Church. (Johannes Kerkorrel is the trademark of a Dutch organ.) Other musicians, such as Andre du Toit, James Phillips, (also performing under the name Bernoldus Niemand), and Karla Krimpelien were prominent in the movement. Concerts: The tour The tour focused on getting South African youth to understand issues going on in the government. Major surveillance and threats from police sparked trouble at the beginning of the tour. This created issues over suitable venues to host the tour. The tour tried to get into University venues, but was banned from most and not allowed to perform because of the ‚Äúoffensive language by the bands ran counter to the refined art of academic debate.‚Äù Instead, the tour played in abandoned buildings. During the tour, media coverage was negative. The media claimed that the tour's song lyrics were na√Øve. Kerkorrel later said that, ‚ÄúThey obviously don‚Äôt realize that our whole idea is to write na√Øve lyrics. We are liberating the language. If you can make a language into rock and roll, it can‚Äôt be an oppressive language anymore.‚Äù The musicians used rock and roll music to represent traditional Afrikaans songs and symbols. Songs in the movement portrayed basic symbols that were important in South Africa‚Äîre-purposing them to represent their message. For example, in the song, Ossewa (oxwagon), the standard symbol of the oxwagon was changed to a car and helped to lead Afrikaners out of political turmoil and into the future.

Career  Lubinsky was born to a Jewish family in Branford, Connecticut, the son of Fannie (n√©e Rosinsky, 1865‚Äì1941) and Louis Lubinsky (also known as Leuvinsky, 1857‚Äì1921), both of whom had emigrated from Russia in 1883. By 1915, he was working as an electrical contractor in New Haven, before serving as a radio operator in the US Navy. In 1922, Lubinsky founded The Radio Shop of Newark, in Newark, New Jersey, and in 1923 set up a radio station, WRAZ, which changed its title to WCBX and then, in October 1924, to WNJ. The station operated from the attic of Lubinsky's home before its studio in Newark opened in 1925. The station became known as \\"The Voice of Newark\\" and presented programmes for immigrants to the New York metropolitan area in Polish, Lithuanian and Italian. In 1929 Lubinsky set up the Radio Investment Co., but in November 1932 his application to renew the license for WNJ was refused by the Federal Radio Commission because he refused to accept limits on the station's bandwidth. Lubinsky fought the action in the courts, but the station was taken off the air in March 1933. Lubinsky then started the United Radio Company, which sold and repaired radios and phonographs and began selling records. Encouraged by his friend Eli Oberstein, a music business executive, he and record producer Ozzie Cadena set up Savoy Records in 1942. The company released jazz recordings made before the Petrillo Ban came into effect and also recordings made by musicians attempting to circumvent the ban by recording under pseudonyms. Among the latter was Bonnie Davis, whose recording of \\"Don't Stop Now\\" reached number 1 on the R&B; chart in 1943. By 1944, the label had begun to release records by leading jazz musicians, such as Ben Webster and Lester Young, and over the next few years its roster of musicians expanded to include Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Erroll Garner, Miles Davis, Paul Williams and Brownie McGhee. After opening an office in California in 1948, Savoy continued to have success with such musicians as Johnny Otis, Little Esther Phillips, Cannonball Adderley and Big Maybelle, although after the mid-1950s it began to concentrate increasingly on gospel music, including Clara Ward, the Drinkard Singers, Alex Bradford, the Caravans, Dorothy Love Coates and the Original Gospel Harmonettes and James Cleveland. Lubinsky continued as head of the company until shortly before his death in Newark in 1974.  Character and controversies  Lubinsky in 1923\\"Herman Lubinsky\\", Radio Dealer, January 1923, page 37. Lubinsky has been described as \\"an arrogant bully... the quintessential loudmouth, overweight, cigar-smoking record man with little apparent charm\\"; as \\"a colorful character... endowed with a shrewd business sense\\"; and as \\"a rather profane cheapskate who had a low opinion of many of the musicians that he recorded\\" and who \\"was best known for his desire to cut expenses at all costs\\". His oldest daughter, Lois Grossberg, later said, \\"He was paranoid about money. It consumed him like a burning fire. He had a reputation as an ogre in the business. You have no idea of the cheapness.\\" The singer Little Jimmy Scott recorded for Savoy in the 1950s. He left the label in the early 1960s and recorded an album with Ray Charles for the latter's new label, Tangerine. However, Lubinsky claimed that Scott was under contract to him for his lifetime. The record was withdrawn. As a result, Scott retreated from the recording industry until after Lubinsky's death.

The term also refers to the form of government that the National Convention favored during the French Revolutionary Wars, as France established republics through its occupation of neighboring territories in Europe. Most of these client states, or sister republics, were means of controlling occupied lands through a mix of French and local authority. The institution of republican governments as a means of promoting democratic nationalism over monarchies (primarily the Bourbons and Habsburgs) set the stage for the appearance of nationalist sentiment across Europe, which significantly influenced the course of European history (see 1830 and Revolutions of 1848). Today, \\"revolutionary republic\\" can refer to various governments in disparate locations. In the United Kingdom, it can be defined as those who advocate for the removal of the monarch as head of state, or for the replacement of the monarch with an elected figurehead, as in Irish nationalism. In Australia, revolutionary republicanism is closely tied to moderate nationalism, along with opposition to monarchy. Revolutionary American Republic The Easter Rising, a major event of Irish republicanism. Leading up to and during the War of the American Independence, in the 1760s and 1770s, intellectual and political leaders in the Thirteen Colonies closely read history to compare forms of governments and their effectiveness.Trevor Colbourn, The Lamp of Experience: Whig History and the Intellectual Origins of the American Revolution (1965) online version They were especially concerned with the history of liberty in England and with the rights of Englishmen, which they claimed were the proper heritage of the colonists. These intellectuals were especially influenced by Britain's Country Party (which opposed the ruling Court Party). The Country Party relied heavily on the classical republicanism of Roman heritage; it celebrated the ideals of duty and virtuous citizenship. It drew heavily on ancient Greek city-state and Roman republican examples.H. T. Dickinson, ed., A companion to eighteenth- century Britain (2002) p. 300 The Country Party denounced the corruption surrounding the Court Party in London, centering on the royal court. The resulting political ideology was widespread in America by 1775.Mortimer N. S. Sellers, American republicanism (1994) p. 3 Robert Kelley called republicanism \\"the distinctive political consciousness of the entire Revolutionary generation\\".Robert Kelley, \\"Ideology and Political Culture from Jefferson to Nixon,\\" American Historical Review, 82 (June 1977), 536 J. G. A. Pocock explained the intellectual sources in America:J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment p 507 American revolutionaries took a lesson from Ancient Rome. They were determined to avoid the luxurious lifestyles and greed that had destroyed the Roman Empire.Gordon Wood, The Idea of America (2011) p. 325 A virtuous citizen was defined as one who ignored monetary compensation and made a commitment to resist and eradicate corruption. Republicanism required the service of those who were willing to give up their own interests for a common good. According to Bernard Bailyn, \\"The preservation of liberty rested on the ability of the people to maintain effective checks on wielders of power and hence in the last analysis rested on the vigilance and moral stamina of the people.\\" The duty of the virtuous citizen became a foundation for the ideology of the American Revolution.Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (1967) References Sources  * Category:Republicanism Category:Modern history of Italy * ","title":"Revolutionary republic"},{"id":"42308636","text":"Von Franco (born May 29, 1952) is a self-taught American artist associated with the Lowbrow art movement and Kustom Kulture.

Olson (6 December 1952 ‚Äì 2 May 2004) was an American genetic epidemiologist and biostatistician, \\"best known internationally for her contributions to advanced statistical methods in genetic epidemiology\\". Early life and education Olson was born on 6 December 1952 in Concord, New Hampshire in 1952, the sixth of seven children. Her father was one of three medical doctors in the town. In 1974, she was awarded a bachelor's degree in psychology (summa cum laude) from the University of New Hampshire. After graduating she worked as a research assistant in the Biophysics Research Laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Although originally intending to pursue a medical degree, in 1978 Olson began a graduate program in psychology at Wayne State University. For several years she worked as a biostatistician, and ultimately entered a graduate program in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. She was awarded her M.S. in 1988 and then her Ph.D in 1991. Her work on segregation of the taste phenotype phenylthiocarbamide earned her a nomination for a student award at the 1988 meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. Research career Upon obtaining her doctorate, Olson spent three years working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington. There she \\"developed statistical methods for model- free genetic linkage analysis\\". She subsequently became involved in the National Wilms Tumor Study Group. She then worked as a research assistant in the Department of Biometry and Biomathematics at the State University of New York, Roswell Park Division. Finally in 1995, she joined the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Case Western Reserve University, and shortly before her death was awarded tenure. During her career she published 53 articles and at the time of her death had 7 articles in submission. According to her obituary in the American Journal of Human Genetics, \\"In 1996, she coauthored a much-cited paper, published in Nature, describing the first genetic linkage to Crohn disease and the first use of multipoint-linkage analysis in genetic mapping of a complex disease. At the International Genetic Epidemiology Society meeting in 2001, she received the Best Paper in Genetic Epidemiology award for 2000. She later developed the conditional logistic model for studying linkage from a sample of affected relative pairs.

Though prohibited by the laws of many countries, there have been many reported cases of necrophilia throughout history. History Incidents of necrophilia are noted to have occurred throughout history. Greek author Herodotus (c.484‚Äì425 BC) stated in his Histories that in Ancient Egypt, bodies of exceptionally beautiful women were not embalmed immediately after their deaths, but only after several days had passed, in order to prevent a recurrence of a case where it was discovered that an embalmer had sex with the body of a recently dead woman. According to the Babylonian Talmud (3rd‚Äì5th centuries AD), King Herod of Judea (73/74 BC ‚Äì 4 BC) desired a certain maiden and, after she killed herself to avoid marrying him, preserved her body in honey for seven years. Some say that he embalmed her in order to have intercourse with her; others say that he did not have intercourse with her.Bava Batra 3b. Roman-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (37 ‚Äì ), whose works are the main source for Herod's life and character, says nothing about any necrophilia on his part. Remains of pottery from the Moche civilization represent dead skeletal figures engaged in sexual intercourse with living humans. Gilles de Rais is noted to have sexually violated the dead bodies of his victims. According to criminologist Herschel Prins, it was said that until the 19th century, if a betrothed girl in Central Europe died before her marriage day, the spouse could still carry out the ceremony by copulating with the body. =In military conflicts= During the 18th-century conflict of Peru between rebels of Tupac Amaru and Colonial forces, rebels had sex with dead women. In the 19th-century Russo-Turkish war, military forces sexually abused dead bodies. During the Moroccan War of 1919‚Äì1926, necrophilia was committed by the troops. A Chinese man was killed during the Nanking Massacre, after he refused to have sex with dead women. During the Rwandan genocide, sex with dead bodies was reported. Arthur Shawcross, an American serial killer from Rochester, New York, had also practiced necrophilia. Shawcross (also known as the Genesee River Killer) was convicted of 11 murders in November 1990. He claimed to have killed, raped, decapitated, and eaten two Vietcong women during a tour of Vietnam with the 4th Supply and Transport Company of the 4th Infantry Division in 1968, during the Vietnam War. He reportedly also committed necrophilic sexual acts and mutilations on his victims in Rochester between 1988 and 1989. All but one were prostitutes from the area. Shawcross received two separate life sentences in Monroe County, NY and Wayne County, NY respectively.

Much of the body of her work focuses on hate speech, especially the practical effects of linguistic practices in shaping the social conditions that make genocide and other significant acts of oppression possible. Her research started in the United States but quickly branched in to other regions of the world, and now focuses on Rwanda and the surrounding region. From 2014 to 2017, she also served as the chair of the APA Committee on Public Philosophy. Her current work develops an analysis of Toxic Speech, bringing philosophy and epidemiology into conversation. Education and career Tirrell received her bachelor's in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1980 and went on to earn her doctorate in philosophy (with a dissertation focused on metaphor) from the University of Pittsburgh in 1986 under the direction of Robert Brandom. After receiving her doctorate, she accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving tenure and Associate Professorship status in 1994. In 1993, Tirrell accepted an appointment as Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, before being promoted to Associate Professor - a position she occupied until July 2017. At U Mass Boston, she also taught in Women's Studies. Tirrell also served a year as Visiting Associate Professor of Philosophy in 2004‚Äì2005 at Wellesley College, and in Spring 2018 visited in the Philosophy department at the University of Pittsburgh. Research areas and publications Tirrell has written a large number of peer-reviewed papers, contributed to a number of anthologies, and written several encyclopedia articles. Much of the body of Tirrell's work focuses on hate speech, especially the practical effects of linguistic practices in shaping the social conditions that make genocide and other significant acts of oppression possible. Tirrell's hate speech research is distinctive in its emphasis on the inferential power of the racial epithet, holding that its power to license socially damaging inferences is more significant and more insidious) than the performative action of hurling it. Tirrell uses the tools of inferential role semantics to explain what is at issue between those who think certain deeply derogatory terms (especially racist derogations that enact oppression) should be banned (she calls them ‚ÄòAbsolutists‚Äô), and those who think the terms can safely be used by members of the groups who are targeted by such words (she calls these ‚ÄòReclaimers‚Äô). As Tirrell's research progressed, she began to integrate her inferentialist approach with speech act theory, and Wittgenstein's basic concept of a language game. Tirrell's research started in the United States but later branched in to other regions of the world, now focusing on Rwanda and the surrounding region. Focusing more on 'speech as action' than she previously had, and working on explaining the action-engendering power of certain deeply derogatory terms led her towards studying the role of changing speech practices before and during the Rwandan genocide (which then led her to participate in discussions with prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania.) In related work, Tirrell has argued that apology, although by itself an insufficient means of making amends, is in fact a prerequisite to doing so - and that reparations and humanitarian aid, unless coupled with an apology, result in a situation where true reconciliation has not occurred. Tirrell is also noteworthy for her sophisticated and nuanced arguments in feminist philosophy of language. She argues that for women to thrive, the inherent male biases of English must be altered, making way for a competing view of the world to be put forward - an argument she goes into detail in her 1993 essay ‚ÄúDefinition and Power: Toward Authority Without Privilege.‚Äù Tirrell has also addressed the anti-pornography views of Catharine MacKinnon, using her own analysis of hate speech to support MacKinnon's views about subordination and silencing, while emphasizing the importance of protecting women's ability to articulate their own experiences. Policies against sexist discursive practices must not be so stringent that they undermine the creative development of new discursive practices and the semantic authority of members of oppressed groups. Tirrell has also written extensively on issues of metaphor. In a series of articles, she develops the view that any account of metaphor should center on what it is to interpret a bit of discourse metaphorically, rather than looking for semantic or syntactic markers that elicit such interpretations. In ‚ÄúExtending: The Structure of Metaphor‚Äù (No√ªs, 1989), she uses extended metaphors as the basis for a substantive account of metaphorical interpretation, and introduces the concept of expressive commitment, commitment to the viability and value of particular modes of discourse. Unlike literal interpretation, metaphorical interpretation puts the expressive commitment in the forefront of the interpretive process. Through this early inferentialist approach, Tirrell's account explains the affinities and differences between extension and explication, and hence of the age-old problem of paraphrase. Further, the account allows for the open- endedness of metaphor without succumbing to the view that metaphor is non- cognitive. In later work, Tirrell decisively undermines the view that metaphor should be understood as elliptical simile (‚ÄúReductive and Non-Reductive Simile Theories of Metaphor‚Äù(J. Phil, 1991). Her work brings inferential role semantics, as developed in the Pittsburgh School, to bear on alternative theories of metaphor, and shows the importance of interpretive practices.

In the ≈åtenmon Incident of 866, Yoshimi ordered Minamoto no Makoto's arrest based on the testimony of Tomo no Yoshio, but Yoshifusa protested Makoto's innocence and prevented it. After this, Yoshimi lost most of his political influence. In 867, Yoshimi suddenly became ill in his chambers, and died that same month. He was posthumously granted the rank of . In accordance with his will, he was given a simple burial, his coffin covered with just a single sheet.  Personality and anecdotes  According to the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku, Yoshimi was magnanimous and excelled since childhood. A deep believer in Buddhism, his long habit of abstaining from meat and eating simple food meant that all his life he was extremely thin. The same text records a number of anecdotes about his life, as follow: *Once, when Emperor Ninmy≈ç had boiled some medicine to remove its impurities, he ordered his retainers to taste it to determine its consistencies. Nervous, nobody would try it, but Yoshimi took the cup and drank it all. Ninmy≈ç is said to have praised Yoshimi for respecting his duty to his master. *Yoshimi studied Buddhist writings and was familiar with the Shingon school. When his wife died in Yoshimi's thirties, he immersed himself in prayer to shake off his desires and never remarried.  Legends  The Konjaku Monogatarish≈´ contains a story in which Yoshimi defends Ono no Takamura who was still a student, when the latter is accused of a crime. Later, Yoshimi dies of sickness and is taken before Enma in Hell. Takamura, now working in Enma's palace as a retainer and assisting in his judgments, intervenes, and Yoshimi is forgiven and returned to life.

However, Yoshimi's obituary entry in the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku does praise the talent and conduct of Tadakata and Naokata, and especially Tadakata's ability with clerical script. Yoshimi's brothers Yoshifusa and Nagara married their daughters to emperors Montoku and Seiwa and were thus able to become the grandfathers of the emperors born of those marriages, but while Yoshimi married off his daughters similarly, neither of them was fortunate enough to bear the emperor any children.

The primary purpose of the dam and its reservoir, Upper S√ªre Lake, is to provide municipal water supply and hydroelectric power generation. The dam is operated jointly by the Administration of Roads and Bridges and the Syndicate des Eaux du Barrage d'Esch-sur-S√ªre (SEBES) while the power station is operated by Soci√©t√© Electrique de l'Our (SEO). Background It was first conceived in the 1950s to help replace nature groundwater resources for the town of Esch-sur-S√ªre. Using an Andr√© Coyne design, the dam was constructed between 1956 and 1957 and the power station was commissioned in 1963. The reservoir has been drained twice during the dam's life; once in 1969 to install a new fixed water intake and again in 1991 to install and adjustable-arm intake which mitigate issues with algae growth in the reservoir. Dam The Esch-sur-S√ªre is an arch dam with a height of and length of . It is wide at its crest and wide at its base. The dam sits at the head of a catchment area and creates the Upper S√ªre Lake which has a total volume of . The lake has a surface area of and is long. It is at it deepest point and the normal elevation is . Power station The power station at the base of the dam contains two 5.5 MW Francis turbine- generators for a total installed capacity of 11 MW. The power station generates an average of 16 GWh annually. Downstream of the dam there are three weirs fitted with Kaplan turbines with a total installed capacity of 550 kW. Spillway plans The dam also provides for flood control but has no spillway. Currently, two bottom outlets with a discharge capacity pass floods through the reservoir. Floods in the 1990s highlighted the need for a spillway at the dam. A design for a chute spillway on the left abutment of the dam have been drafted but not implemented.

The road links the suburbs Orakei, Mission Bay, and Kohimarama ending in Saint Heliers providing easy access to the local beaches. Retrieved 16 October 2013. Tamaki Drive was completed in 1932 and incorporates The Strand, Bice Esplanade and, what was once part of the old Kohimarama Road. It is also referred to as the Waterfront Road. Tamaki Drive is a flat road around 8 km (5 miles) long and popular with walkers, runners and roller skaters, and includes a dedicated cycle lane. Those travelling along Tamaki Drive can find scenic highlights and peaceful views across the harbour to the volcanic island Rangitoto. The cliffs backing onto Tamaki Drive are made of Waitemata Sandstone strata clothed in places with pohutukawa. These trees seem to flower out of season, because these are actually Kermadec pohutukawa with small distinctive roundish leaves. Retrieved 16 October 2013.  History The first MƒÅori to settle on the foreshore found rich natural resources in and around the Waitemata Harbour, especially seafood. The seasonal fishing grounds brought many MƒÅori here to fish, trade and socialise, making it a very desirable location, worth defending. MƒÅori recognised early the strategic significance of Takaparawhau (Bastion Point), the cliff between Okahu Bay and Mission Bay with its panoramic outlook over the Waitemata Harbour. MƒÅori gave the area the name TƒÅmaki Makau Rau, meaning the isthmus desired by hundred lovers, this area is now encompassed by the City of Auckland. The name Tamaki Drive has since been given to the road which follows the coastline of the southern shore of the Harbour. At the time when Europeans began to establish homes in the Auckland area, the MƒÅori tribe (iwi), NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua ≈årƒÅkei controlled the area, with Okahu Bay serving as a key site, overlooked by Bastion Point. NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua continue to hold traditional authority (mana whenua) over this part of Auckland. Though initially few European settlers lived on this part of the Harbour, the colonial government sited their first infrastructure for the defence of Auckland here. Fort Bastion was built in 1886, to serve as a parallel installation to the establishment of batteries and submarine mining stations at North Head on the Harbour's northern entrance. This action was prompted by a rumoured threat of a Russian warship. Retrieved 26 November 2013. Updated to defend the growing city in World War I, other guns were installed, but none were fired except in training. By World War II, this area was again an active military site, traces of which remain visible today. After the War, the communities linked by Tamaki Drive became popular residential suburbs, and today locals and visitors are attracted to the popular beachfront walkway, water sports and caf√© culture. Landmarks and Features Tamaki Drive is studded with several significant scenic landmarks, presented here from west to east. = Okahu Bay Reserve= The name Okahu Bay comes from the MƒÅori , meaning \\"the dwelling place of Kahumatamomoe\\". It was the site of the home village of NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua, an important MƒÅori iwi (tribe). The village was considered \\"a dreadful eyesore and potential disease centre\\" by the Auckland City Council, who relocated the inhabitants in 1952, prior to the Queen Elizabeth II's Royal Tour of 1952-53. Today, the reserve at ≈åkahu Bay is a popular location for Aucklanders to relax and enjoy the waterfront. It is possible to go out onto the water with kayaks, which are available for rent at the west-side of the bay. Retrieved 18 October 2013. Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium on the east-side of the bay is one of New Zealand's favourite attractions. The Royal Akarana Yacht Club is located in the west-corner of the bay. The bay has a boat ramp, a jetty, picnic facilities and toilets. = Orakei Domain= When crossing Tamaki Drive to the landward side Okahu Bay borders onto the Orakei Domain. This park has a sports ground located beside the waterfront for sports such as soccer, rugby and cricket. Retrieved 18 October 2013. An adventure playground for children is another feature. The Domain is home to the Teachers Eastern Rugby Club and the Orakei Bowling Club. The Ngake Reserve, a pleasant open green space, is located at the top of the Orakei Domain. Kelly Tarlton Aquarium =Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium= In 1985 diver Kelly Tarlton established Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium in Auckland. Retrieved 17 October 2013. His vision was to create an underwater facility where visitors could admire marine life by travelling on a moving platform around various tunnels. The redundant storm water and sewage tanks at Takaparawhau on Auckland's eastern waterfront provided the perfect site. Retrieved 17 October 2013. The aquarium holds around 2,000 fish from some 40 species, including stingrays and sharks, most of which can be observed while walking through the underwater tunnel. =Bastion Point= Bastion Point, located at the west end of the Mission Bay, had strategic importance for both MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ. Its commanding view over the entrance to the Waitemata Harbour made it a key site for the defence of MƒÅori settlements and later of Auckland City. Traces of the colonial defences remain from the establishment of Fort Bastion here in 1886. Initially the Battery defending the Harbour entrance had two 'disappearing guns', supplemented by two 6 pounders, with a magazine linked to covered passages and a search light mounted on Bastion Rock. At sea level, the submarine mining depot was set up at Biddick's Bay, opposite its northern equivalent across the Harbour at Torpedo Bay. Fort Bastion covered the seaward approaches, the Motukorea and Rangitoto Channels. The defence forces abandoned Fort Bastion by the 1920s, but the site was re-activated in World War II. With the Savage Memorial being built over the earlier Artillery storage tunnels from 1940‚Äì1943, the Battery was now sited on the cliff top above the Tamaki Yacht Club, initially with 12 pounders guns, later replaced by more efficient 6 pounders. At water-level, two guns were installed below the Tamaki Yacht Club on the by-now flattened Bastion Rock. A boom linking Torpedo Bay with Bastion Point across the Harbour was designed to prevent enemy submarines reaching Auckland. An anti-aircraft battery, three searchlight emplacements, an observation post, radar station and a camp to house the expanding military personnel required to man these installations made this a vital installation. Mission Bay and its neighbour, Orakei, achieved national attention in 1977 when MƒÅori protestors occupied vacant land at Bastion Point. Land which had formerly belonged to the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua iwi had been acquired cheaply for public works many decades before, and members of the iwi occupied the land for 507 days demanding its return. The site was largely returned to the iwi after a long and not entirely bloodless occupation. The occupation was a pivotal event in shaping the processes by which the Crown investigated breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Waitangi Tribunal, set up in 1975, became empowered in 1985 to include historical grievances as far back as 1840. Retrieved 30 September 2013. Bastion Point is also the location of the Tomb and Memorial Garden for Michael Joseph Savage. He is one of New Zealand's most popular Prime Ministers and renowned as the architect of the welfare state.. Retrieved 26 September 2013. This Art Deco ensemble designed by Tibor Donner and Anthony Bartlett was officially opened in March 1943, and the whole memorial stands on consecrated ground. Trevor Moss Davis Memorial Fountain =Mission Bay Reserve= This is the open green space between Tamaki Drive and Mission Bay Beach. It is also called Selwyn Reserve, after the first Anglican bishop of New Zealand, George Augustus Selwyn. The centre piece of the Mission Bay Reserve is the Trevor Moss Davis Memorial Fountain. Trevor Moss Davis was director of the Auckland liquor firm Hancock and Company and died of a sudden heart attack in 1947 at the age of 45. His father Eliot Davis, nephew of Sir Ernest Davis, Auckland mayor from 1935 to 1945, gifted a memorial fountain at Mission Bay to keep the memory of his son alive. Retrieved 27 September 2013. The fountain was designed by architect George Tole and created by Richard Gross. It is constructed of Sicilian marble fluted to catch the light and decorated with three bronze sea monsters gushing water. The memorial is a landmark on the city's waterfront, regularly, sending dancing jets of water as high as 12 m (40 ft) in the air and at night it features a spectacular light show. Retrieved 27 September 2013. During the summer young children use it as a paddling pool. =Kohimarama Beach= Kohimarama Beach is the longest beach along Tamaki Drive and is mainly used for swimming. It is located east of the Kohimarama Yacht Club and many boat races are held there. There are boat ramps, bicycle stands and toilets present as services for visitors and locals. Retrieved 18 October 2013. =St. Heliers Bay and Beach Reserve= This reserve is one of Auckland's premier waterfront destinations. The bay is popular for swimming and has a boat ramp, making it a busy location on sunny days. Retrieved 16 October 2013. St. Heliers Bay was named by Major Walmsley in the late 1870s, who owned and managed Auckland's first stud farm at Glen Orchard in 1879. Retrieved 4 October 2013. The bay supposedly reminded him of the fashionable holiday resort Saint Helier, in Jersey, one of Britain's Channel Islands. Events Round The Bays ‚Äì This annual event is the result of the international running boom of the 1970s and 1980s, during which millions of people took up running. Retrieved 11 October 2013. The Auckland Round the Bays Fun Run is one of the largest in the world, and was initiated by the Auckland Joggers Club in the early 1970s. The run is 8.4 km along Tamaki Drive, and follows the contours of the Waitemata Harbour, past Hobson Bay, Okahu Bay, Mission Bay, Kohimarama Beach, and finishing in St. Heliers Bay Reserve.

Ferd. and Winge, is an Ascomycete fungal species and is the only member in the genus Cenococcum. It is one of the most common ectomycorrhizal fungal species encountered in forest ecosystems. The geographic distribution of the species is notably cosmopolitan; it is found in ecosystems with a wide range of environmental conditions, and in many cases in high relative frequency.Trappe, J. M. (1962). Cenococcum graniforme--its distribution, ecology, mycorrhiza formation, and inherent variation (Doctoral dissertation). Because of its wide distribution and abundance in forest soils, it is one of the most well-studied ectomycorrhizal fungal species. While the species has long been known to be sterile and not produce asexual or sexual spores, cryptic sexual stages may exist.Spatafora, J. W., Owensby, C. A., Douhan, G. W., Boehm, E. W., & Schoch, C. L. (2012). Phylogenetic placement of the ectomycorrhizal genus Cenococcum in Gloniaceae (Dothideomycetes). Mycologia, 104(3), 758-765. The hyphae produced by C. geophilum are characterized by their thick (1.5-8 um), straight and jet black appearance with little branching. They usually form monopodial (unbranched) ectomycorrhizas. The mantles of C. geophilum ectomycorrhizas are usually thick with few to many emanating hyphae. Taxonomy Originally described in 1800 from its sclerotia by James Sowerby, the species was named Lycoperdon graniforme Sow. Later, Elias Fries introduced the genus Cenococcum and the sole species was called Cenococcum geophilum Fr. These names were later combined to form Cenococcum graniforme (Sow) Ferd. and Winge in the monographic study of the species by Ferdinandsen and Winge in 1925.Ferdinandsen, C., & Winge, √ñ. (1925). Cenococcum Fr. A monographic study. Kongelige Veterinaer-og Landbohoiskoles Aarsskrift, 332-382. Hatch identified hyphae that formed ectomycorrhizas with ‚Äújet-black‚Äù mantles calling it Mycelium radicus-nigrostrigosum Hatch. Finally, Linhell linked the fungi forming the ectomycorrhizas to the fungus producing the sclerotia earlier described. The officially accepted name for the species is Cenococcum geophilum Fr.LoBuglio, K. F. (1999). Cenococcum. In Ectomycorrhizal Fungi Key Genera in Profile (pp. 287-309). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. Molecular analyses have revealed that C. geophilum is not closely related to other Ascomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi (mostly in the Pezizales) and is actually a member of the Dothideomycetes.LoBuglio, K. F., Berbee, M. L., & Taylor, J. W. (1996). Phylogenetic Origins of the Asexual Mycorrhizal Symbiont Cenococcum geophilum Fr. and Other Mycorrhizal Fungi among the Ascomycetes. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 6(2), 287-294. Cenococcum geophilum is the only known ectomycorrhizal member of the Dothideomycetes. Spatafora et al. (2012) placed C. geophilum in the Gloniaceae as a close relative to members of the Genus Glonium. Ecology =Abundance and distribution= It is not unusual to find Cenococcum geophilum mycelium and ectomycorrhizas in high relative frequency in soil where ectomycorrhizal tree hosts are present. Unlike many ectomycorrhizal fungi, Cenococcum geophilum readily colonizes the fine roots of most ectomycorrhizal hosts. It may be found in all forest successional stages.Visser, S. (1995). Ectomycorrhizal fungal succession in jack pine stands following wildfire. New Phytologist, 129(3), 389-401. Unlike most ectomycorrhizal fungal species, Cenococcum geophilum appears to have no distinct vertical distribution in the organic horizons of soil Dickie, I. A., Xu, B., & Koide, R. T. (2002). Vertical niche differentiation of ectomycorrhizal hyphae in soil as shown by T‚ÄêRFLP analysis.

Vertical distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa in a podzol soil profile. New Phytologist, 159(3), 775-783. Cenococcum geophilum also appears to have an even horizontal spatial distribution pattern at the microscale Scattolin, L., Montecchio, L., Mosca, E., & Agerer, R. (2008). Vertical distribution of the ectomycorrhizal community in the top soil of Norway spruce stands. European journal of forest research, 127(5), 347-357. and site level.Pickles, B. J., Genney, D.

This unusual distributional pattern may be the result of wide niche breadth of Cenococcum geophilum and/or genetic variation within the species. A factor that may contribute to this wide niche breadth is the species ability to tolerate a wide range of stressors. Cenococcum geophilum isolates have been shown to tolerate freezing,Corbery, Y., & Le Tacon, F. (1997). Storage of ectomycorrhizal fungi by freezing.

Biotic and abiotic factors affecting ectomycorrhizal diversity in boreal mixed‚Äêwoods.Oikos, 102(3), 497-504. which may be the result of host trees allocating less carbon to ectomycorrhizal symbiosis when nitrogen in the soil becomes non-limiting to the plant growth. =Enzyme production and nutrient acquisition= Along with other species of ectomycorrhizal fungi, C. geophilum produces extracellular enzymes that are able to hydrolyze substrates found in the soil to access and acquire nutrients important to itself and its host plant. The ectomycorrhizas of C. geophilum have been shown to hydrolyze 14C labeled substrate common in plant litters, including hemicellulose and cellulose.Durall, D. M., Todd, A. W., & Trappe, J. M. (1994). Decomposition of 14C‚Äêlabelled substrates by ectomycorrhizal fungi in association with Douglas fir. New Phytologist, 127(4), 725-729. Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizas have also been shown to produce high levels of laccase, glucoronidase, and xylodase and phosphatase enzymes.Courty, P. E., Pritsch, K., Schloter, M., Hartmann, A., & Garbaye, J. (2005). Activity profiling of ectomycorrhiza communities in two forest soils using multiple enzymatic tests. New Phytologist, 167(1), 309-319. = Carbon sequestration = In the light of climate change there is growing interest in understanding carbon sequestration in mycorrhizal fungal tissues. There is considerable evidence suggesting that C. geophilum mycelium, ectomycorrhizas and sclerotia are highly resistant to decay and have potential to sequester a great deal of carbon in their tissues. Fernandez et al. (2013) found that C. geophilum ectomycorrhizas persisted considerably longer in the soil than those of other ectomycorrhizal fungi.Fernandez, C. W., McCormack, M. L., Hill, J. M., Pritchard, S. G., & Koide, R. T. (2013). On the persistence of Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizas and its implications for forest carbon and nutrient cycles. Soil Biology and Biochemistry, 65, 141-143. This resistance to decay is likely related to the heavy melanization of the cell wall found in C. geophilum hyphae which cannot be degraded with hydrolyzing enzymes and requires the implementation of oxidative enzymes, much like lignin in plant litters.Butler, M. J., & Day, A. W. (1998). Destruction of fungal melanins by ligninases of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and other white rot fungi. International journal of plant sciences, 159(6), 989-995. Cenococcum geophilum produces resting structures called sclerotia. These structures have been found to remain viable in the soil for years. Remarkably, these structures are known to persist relatively undecomposed in the soil for thousands of years.Watanabe, M., Sato, H., Matsuzaki, H., Kobayashi, T., Sakagami, N., Maejima, Y., ... & Hiradate, S. (2007). 14C ages and Œ¥13C of sclerotium grains found in forest soils. Soil Science and Plant Nutrition, 53(2), 125-131. =Genetic diversity and cryptic speciation= Once regarded as a single species, observed variation in morphology, growth rates and response to growth conditions among C. geophilum isolates led researchers to speculate on possibility of cryptic speciation. Advances in molecular techniques have allowed researchers to test this hypothesis by examining the genetic variation in C. geophilum strains at various spatial scales. LoBuglio et al. 1991 examined the degree of variation in the ribosomal DNA across 71 isolates of C. geophilum of varying geographic origin (distinct to similar) and found a great deal of genetic variation across the isolates.LoBuglio, K. F., Rogers, S. O., & Wang, C. J. K. (1991). Variation in ribosomal DNA among isolates of the mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum. Canadian Journal of Botany, 69(11), 2331-2343. A high degree of genetic variation of C. geophilum has been repeatedly observed at the stand level.Jany, J. L., Garbaye, J., & Martin, F. (2002). Cenococcum geophilum populations show a high degree of genetic diversity in beech forests. New Phytologist, 154(3), 651-659.Wu, B., Nara, K., & Hogetsu, T. (2005). Genetic structure of Cenococcum geophilum populations in primary successional volcanic deserts on Mount Fuji as revealed by microsatellite markers. New Phytologist, 165(1), 285-293. Douhan & Rizzo (2005) found phylogenetically distinct lineages of C. geophilum at the scale of the soil sample supporting the hypothesis that there is cryptic sympatric speciation occurring in C. geophilum.Douhan, G. W., & Rizzo, D. M. (2005). Phylogenetic divergence in a local population of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum. New Phytologist, 166(1), 263-271.

History  Chateau de Domecy- sur-le-Vault is first mentioned in texts dating back to 1316. At that time, the stronghold was in the hands of the family d'Ostun, in whose possession it remained for over a century. In 1440, the lordship and castle passed by marriage to Edme de Salins, and in 1478, to his son Jean. The son also owned a house in Avallon in front of the church of Saint Lazarus, which was known as h√¥tel des Sires de Domecy. In 1507 Domecy was sold to Louis de Robert. Claude Longueville, Lord of Santigny, brought Domecy into his family in 1537, when he married Philiberte de Robert. In 1569, the fortified house was burned down by troops of Frederick Louis, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken. The land was sold in 1748 to Michel-Auguste de Denesvre, whose family occupied the first ranks of society in Avallon. They undertook the reconstruction of the south wing of the castle to give it the current appearance. = Panels by Redon = Arbres sur un fond jaune, one of the panels painted by Odilon Redon in 1901 for the dining room of the ch√¢teau Portrait of Baroness Robert de Domecy (1900) Baron Robert de Domecy (1867‚Äì1946) commissioned the artist Odilon Redon in 1899 to create 17 decorative panels for the dining room. He also commissioned Redon to do portraits of his wife and their daughter Jeanne, two of which are in the collections of the Mus√©e d'Orsay and the Getty Museum in California. Most of the paintings remained in the family collection until the 1960s. Fifteen of the panels are located today in the Mus√©e d'Orsay, which entered the museum in 1988. Redon created large decorative works for private residences in the past. The panels he painted for the ch√¢teau de Domecy in 1900‚Äì1901 were his most radical compositions. They mark the transition from the ornamental to abstract painting. The landscape details do not show a specific place or space. Only details of trees, twigs with leaves, and budding flowers in an endless horizon can be seen. The colours used are mostly yellow, grey, brown and light blue. Some of the panels are up to 2.5 metres high.  See also  * Ch√¢teau de Domecy-sur-Cure  Literature  * Fran√ßoise Vignier. Dictionnaire des Ch√¢teaux de France, Bourgogne et Nivernais.

Kuzmuk formerly commanded the National Guard of Ukraine (1995‚Äì1996) and holds the highest rank in the Ukrainian military, General of the Army of Ukraine (1998). Biography Kuzmuk was born on April 17, 1954 in a family of military officer Ivan Fedorovych Kuzmuk (?-1973) and Rayisa Mykhailivna Kuzmuk in a village of Diatylivka, Slavuta Raion (Khmelnytskyi Oblast). In 1975 he graduated the Kharkiv Higher Armor Command College. In 1975-80 Kuzmuk starting out as a platoon leader of armor forces served until becoming the deputy chief of staff of an armor regiment. In 1980-83 he was an audit student of the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy (Moscow). After that until 1988 Kuzmuk was an instructor at the academy. In 1988-93 he was in leading positions of mechanized rifle division. From 1975 to 1993 Kuzmuk served in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, Belorussian Military District, Moscow Military District, Leningrad Military District, Carpathian Military District and Odessa Military District. In 1993-95 he was a commander of the 32nd Army Corps, senior military chief of Crimea. In 1995-96 Kuzmuk was a commander of the National Guard of Ukraine and in 1996-2001 - the Minister of Defense. At the end of 2001 he finished his military career and became a politician by participating in the 2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election on the party list of For United Ukraine. Soon after winning some seats in the Verkhovna Rada, For United Ukraine fell apart and Kuzmuk stayed with the Labour Ukraine (an off-shot of the Labour Party of Ukraine). During that time in 2004 he was again appointed the Minister of Defense, while keeping his parliamentary seat. After the Orange Revolution Kuzmuk lost his ministerial seat and was replaced by Anatoliy Hrytsenko. In the 2012 parliamentary election Kuzmuk was elected into parliament as a member of Party of Regions. In the 2014 parliamentary election Kuzmuk tried to win a parliamentary seat through winning electoral district 38 situated in Novomoskovsk; but failed when he ended 3rd in the district with 12.78%.

Both diseases are uncommon, but concurrence is extremely rare which makes Bruck syndrome very difficult to research. Bruck syndrome is thought to be an atypical variant of osteogenesis imperfecta most resembling type III, if not its own disease. Multiple gene mutations associated with osteogenesis imperfecta are not seen in Bruck syndrome. Many affected individuals are within the same family, and pedigree data supports that the disease is acquired through autosomal recessive inheritance. Bruck syndrome has features of congenital contractures, bone fragility, recurring bone fractures, flexion joint and limb deformities, pterygia, short body height, and progressive kyphoscoliosis. Individuals encounter restricted mobility and pulmonary function. A reduction in bone mineral content and larger hydroxyapatite crystals are also detectable Joint contractures are primarily bilateral and symmetrical, and most prone to ankles. Bruck syndrome has no effect on intelligence, vision, or hearing. Genetics The genetics of Bruck syndrome differs from osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta involves autosomal dominant mutations to Col 1A2 or Col 1A2 which encode type 1 procollagen. Bruck syndrome is linked to mutations in two genes, and therefore is divided in two types. Bruck syndrome type 1 is caused by a homozygous mutation in the FKBP10 gene. Type 2 is caused by a homozygous mutation in the PLOD2 gene. Mechanism Type 1 encodes FKBP65, an endoplasmic reticulum associated peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that functions as a chaperone in collagen biosynthesis. Osteoblasts deficient in FKBP65 have a buildup of procollagen aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum which reduces their ability to form bone. Furthermore, Bruck syndrome type 1 patients have under-hydroxylated lysine residues in the collagen telopeptide and as a result show diminished hydroxylysylpyridinoline cross-links. Type 2 encodes the enzyme, lysyl hydroxylase 2, which catalyzes hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen cross-links. PLOD2 is most expressed in active osteoblasts since collagen cross-linking is tissue-specific. Mutation in PLOD2 alters the structure of telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase and prevents fibril formation of collagen type 1. Bone analysis shows the lysine residues of telopeptides in collagen type 1 are under-hydroxylated. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Bruck syndrome must distinguish the association of contractures and skeletal fragility. Ultrasound is used for prenatal diagnosis. The diagnosis of a neonate bears resemblance to arthrogryposis multiplex congenital, and later in childhood to osteogenesis imperfecta. Management Until more molecular and clinical studies are performed there will be no way to prevent the disease. Treatments are directed towards alleviating the symptoms. To treat the disease it is crucial to diagnose it properly. Orthopedic therapy and fracture management are necessary to reduce the severity of symptoms. Bisphosphonate drugs are also an effective treatment. History The first case was in 1897 of a male who was described by Bruck as having bone fragility and bone contractures. Bruck was credited with the first description and the disease‚Äôs eponym.

It is now represented by the barony of Carbury. Also known as Cairbre na Catha (Carbury of the Battles). It existed from at least the 6th century to the 16th century AD. As a frontier territory of Connacht it was a saor-t√∫ath (territory exempt from tribute) under several Irish dynasties over time, but mostly under a branch of the O'Connor dynasty called the Clann Aindrias or O'Connor Sligo The O Conor Sligo (√ì Conchobhair Sligigh) were a branch of the √ì Conchobhair royal family who were Kings of Connacht. They were descended from Brian Luighnech Ua Conchobhair (k.1181) and were Lords of Sligo into the middle of the 17th century. For a list of chiefs of Cairbre Drom Cliabh see O'Conchobar Sligigh Location and Extent This territory is between the coast and the Dartry Mountains, borders Ulster to the north and extends from the Owenmore river at Ballysadare to the Drowes (Drobhaois) River near Bundoran. It included the districts of C√°lraighe Locha Gile, Magh Cetne, Br√©achmhaigh,https://www.logainm.ie/ga/1414432 Magh Eabha,https://www.logainm.ie/ga/112071 Cuil Iorra and part of Dartraige. Benbulben (Benn Ghulbain) is in it along with Knocknarea and Lough Gill. The extent was larger prior to the twelfth century. Organisation The territory was governed by an elected R√≠-tuath and an oireachtas or assembly of free noblemen under the Gaelic system of Fenechus law. It was organised into parishes from the 12th century and townlands. History The t√∫ath takes its name from the semi-legendary king Cairbre mac N√©ill, third son of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Cairbre is described as an enemy of St. Patrick. T√≠rech√°n's seventh century Life of Patrick states that Cairbre was cursed by the saint, at the hill of Tara, that none of his descendants would be High King. He is most closely associated with Tailtu and Granard in the early accounts. Cairbre was excluded from most later lists of High Kings but remains in the earliest, the Baile Chuinn Ch√©tchathaig. Chiefs of Cen√©l Cairpre included O'Mulclohy (the ) a name later translated to Stone. Cairbre's descendants at an early date controlled a larger Cairpre Mor grouping which stretched from Sligo to Westmeath, taking in Leitrim and parts of Fermanagh (such as Tuatha Ratha or Magheraboy) and Longford (North Tethbae). It was split in two by the expansion of the Kingdom of Breifne under the U√≠ Bri√∫in. The southern group known as the Cairpre Gabra settled in the barony of Granard in County Longford. Another branch known as the \\"\\" which settled in barony of Carbury in County Kildare was probably a later off-shoot of this group. Cairbre supplied only one High King of Ireland, his grandson, T√∫athal M√°elgarb Dunadhach. In 561 AD the Battle of C√∫l Dreimhne (also called the Battle of the Book) was fought at Cooladrumman, a townland near Drumcliff in this territory. This territory, under the shadow of Benbulbin (from the ), is where Conall Gulbain set out to conquer T√≠r Chonaill, modern Donegal. Cairbre Drom Cliabh remained closely associated politically with the Cenel Conaill but pressure from the Kingdom of Breifne continued and various kings were imposed by them: It may have covered a larger area before the twelfth century when conquered by Tigern√°n Ua Ruairc of Breifne. It was then taken over by Brian Luighnech Ua Conchobhair of the O'Conchobar dynasty sept called the Clann Aindrias or √ì Conchobhair Sligigh in the period of instability following the Norman conquest of Ireland. He was killed in 1181 at Magh-Diughbha in Crich Coirpre with his brother Maghnus by the Cenel Conaill. In 1051 AD Cathal, son of Tighearnain, lord of Breifne, went upon a predatory excursion into Eabha, and demolished Dun-Feich, where fifty persons were slain, and whence seven hundred cows were carried off. In 575 AD the monastery of Drumcliff was founded by Saint Colmcille. Norman era As a border territory it was granted to Norman adventurer Philip de Angelo (Costello, ) one of the brothers of Gilbert de Angulo. This was one of a number of grants to outlawed Norman lords at this time by Cathal Crobhdearg, King of Connacht who was seeking help against his enemies in Ulster. Gilbert and his brothers led the forward policy against Cenel Conaill on behalf of the king but Gilbert was killed at Ballyshannon in 1213. Following the invasion of Connacht by Richard M√≥r de Burgh in the 1230s Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly of the FitzGerald dynasty was granted lands and established the castle, port and town of Sligo. He was to the forefront of pushing the frontier against Tir Conaill and Tir Eoghan until his defeat in the Battle of Creadran Cille at Ros Ceide in 1257. The family fell out with the de Burghs later and were divested of their Connacht lands. This weakening of the Norman colony in Carbury and Sligo allowed the Clann Aindrias the space to establish the Lordship of Iochtar Connacht (Lower Connacht) in the wake of the Burke Civil War from their base, Caislen-conor in Fassacoille, now Bradcullen in the townland of Urlar.https://www.logainm.ie/ga/45177?s=urlar Lines of the original Cenel Cairbre Drom Cliabh survived quasi-anglicised as 'Stone' (from O'Mulclohy) in Carbury and the O'Flanagan's of Tuatha Ratha, in the barony of Magheraboy, Fermanagh. Later Medieval era In September 1588 three ships of the Spanish armada were wrecked on the coast of Cairbre at Streedagh strand. The Spanish officer Francisco de Cuellar described the shipwreck and his subsequent adventures in a letter home in 1591. The wreck-site was rediscovered in 1985. Sir Henry Sidney shired the county of Sligo, intended to replace the old Gaelic territory system. =Annal entries= In AD 542 the Battle of Sligo, in which Eogan B√©l, king of Connacht, fell by Fergus and Domnall two sons of Muircheartach son of Erc, and by Ainmire son of Setna and by Naindid son of Dua who were the victors. Whence it was said: > The battle of U√≠ Fiachrach is fought, With fury of edges over the border, > Foemen's kine bellow against spears, The battle was spread out into Crinder. > The Sligo river carried off to the great sea Men's blood with their flesh, > They utter paeans over Eba Round the head of Eogan B√©l.

History Urshu was a commercial city governed by a Lord (EN). It was an ally of Ebla and appears in the tablets as Ursa'um. Later it was mentioned in the inscriptions of Gudea (r. c.2144‚Äì2124 BC according to the Middle chronology) as the city where wood resins were procured. An old Assyrian letter that dates to the 19th century BC mentions a temple of the god Ashur in Urshu. In the beginning of the 18th century BC, Urshu allied with Yamhad against Yahdun-Lim of Mari. Relations with Assyria were also strained, and men of Urshu were summoned by Yapah-Adad and his Habiru to attack the lands of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria. The texts of Mari mentions a conflict between Urshu and Carchemish: the tribes of Upra-peans and Ra-beans attacked Urshu through the land of Carchemish, which caused Urshu to attack a contingent of Carchemishean troops and civilians that advanced along the bank of the Euphrates. Later, Urshu became an economic rival to Yamhad and entered an alliance with Qatna and Shamshi-Adad I to attack Sumu-Epuh of Yamhad (r. c.1810-1780 BC). The death of Shamshi-Adad and the rise of Yarim-Lim I of Yamhad brought an end to this rivalry, as Yamhad was elevated into a Great Kingdom and imposed its direct authority over northern, western and eastern Syria, bringing Urshu under its sphere of influence without annexing it. The Tablets of Mari mention a few kings of Urshu who date to this era, including Shennam and Atru-Sipti, who visited Mari in the 12th year of its king Zimri- Lim. =Hittite conquest= The Hittite king Hattusili I attacked Urshu in his second year, laying siege to the city for six months. The Hittite king had 80 chariots and conducted his operations from the city of Lawazantiya (located in modern Elbistan district) in the Taurus foothills of eastern Cilicia. Despite receiving aid from Yamhad and Carchemish, Urshu was burned and destroyed; its lands were plundered and the booty taken to the Hittite capital Hattusa. The history of Urshu after the conquest is ambiguous. In the 15th century BC it appears in the Tablets of Alalakh as \\"Uris\\" or \\"Uressi\\", and is mentioned \\"Urussa\\" in the treaty between the Hittite Tudhaliya II and Sunassura II of Kizzuwatna as part of the latter's territory.

The scandal unfolded while Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in office, though the time period involved also covered successive governments during which Fianna F√°il, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats were all in power. Among those implicated in the scandal are the Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny, justice minister Alan Shatter (since resigned), Secretary General of the Department of Justice Brian Purcell, Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach Martin Fraser, attorney general M√°ire Whelan, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan (since resigned), as well as Independent News & Media, Ireland's largest and most powerful media organisation. The term GUBU (grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented), first used in 1982 to describe the arrest of Malcolm MacArthur in the home of Attorney General Patrick Connolly was invoked to describe the Garda controversy. Shane Phelan, Public Affairs Editor at the Irish Independent commented \\"it is now safe to say we have finally reached GUBU territory\\", while Michael Clifford of the Irish Examiner observed \\"More than 30 years after the original GUBU moment, here was another one.\\" Background While debating the question of penalty points on state television with independent deputy Mick Wallace in May 2013, justice minister Alan Shatter divulged hitherto publicly unknown personal information to viewers about Wallace in an attempt to undermine his opponent. Shatter later admitted receiving his information from Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan but claimed he was not \\"in the business of collecting secret files on politicians\\". Callinan subsequently referred to whistleblowers, such as Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, as \\"disgusting\\" at a Public Accounts Committee in 2014 (see also Garda whistleblower scandal). Timeline The 2014 revelations of surveillance came on Tuesday 25 March, the same day that Martin Callinan resigned as Garda Commissioner over his remarks. On that day it was revealed that the former commissioner had written to the Department of Justice and Equality about the recordings over two weeks before the revelations. He wrote that he had established a working group to deal with the recordings and that they would report to him once they had consulted the Attorney General. He wrote that he had spoken to the Attorney General and that he expected to talk to the Data Protection Commissioner. He wrote that the Attorney General had advised that the recordings be collected and an inventory be made identifying them by station, date and condition. He also wrote that he had ordered all recording of non-999 calls to Garda stations cease and that this happened on 23 November 2013. He wrote that Minister for Justice and Equality Alan Shatter be informed of details of the recordings. On 26 March, Taoiseach Enda Kenny informed the D√°il that he had sent Brian Purcell, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, to Callinan the day before the Garda Commissioner's departure. Fianna F√°il leader Miche√°l Martin said this meant Kenny had effectively \\"sacked\\" Callinan. Kenny also said that he had been personally briefed on Garda surveillance by the Attorney General as the AG did not wish to speak of the matter over the telephone. Response It was soon clear the revelation that telephone calls were recorded en masse would have a major impact on court cases. This has indeed been the case; the first trial to be affected was that of two men suspected of IRA membership on 26 March. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties said: ‚ÄùFor weeks, the ICCL has been calling for the creation of a proper statutory inquiry with the fact- finding powers necessary to restore public trust in the accountability of An Garda S√≠och√°na. Instead, the Government has chosen to refer each successive crisis to a different non-judicial mechanism, none of which has been granted the power comprehensively to establish the truth. Today's revelations regarding the recording of calls to and from Garda stations may have grave ramifications for the administration of justice and this is the day when the rot must stop‚Äù. In response to Callinan's resignation, his Deputy Commissioner Noir√≠n O'Sullivan was selected as provisional Garda Commissioner. The government also set up a statutory commission of investigation. The \\"Commission of Investigation (Certain Matters relative to An Garda S√≠och√°na and other persons)\\" is commonly called the Fennelly Commission, after its sole member, Nial Fennelly, a former Supreme Court justice. Locations According to cabinet minister Simon Coveney, 2,400 physical tape recordings exist from before 2008, as well as an unknown number of digital recordings made after this date. Coveney was unable to identify the listeners. Telephone calls at all 26 divisional headquarters of the Garda S√≠och√°na were tapped.

Early life and family  He was born June 3, 1829, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the son of Joseph Johnson and Mary Chase. He was educated in Haverhill in the trade of shoe-making.  Life in California  He came to California via the Central American isthmus in 1851, at the age of twenty-two. He mined in Grass Valley for about a year. He became a clerk with the Steam Navigation Company on the Sacramento River, and remained in that job until 1856. He then made some money speculating in grain, tobacco, and sugar. He married Amelia H. Diffenderffer, a native of St. Louis and soon thereafter made a trip back East. He stayed about six months before returning. Upon his return to California, he purchased cattle and started a dairy farm. He was profitable, until a flood came and killed his cattle. Then he went to Sacramento and worked in the furniture business with a Mr. Vanhusen. Their partnership ended when a fire destroyed their business. He then went back to work for the Steam Navigation Company for about a year. He bought government land in Monroeville, in what was then Colusa County. He built a house on it, and made other improvements. He lived in Monroeville from 1860 until 1874, when he sold his land and went to Chico. He purchased property at the corners of Fourth and Wall streets, and, in 1887, at Third and Broadway where he established the Johnson House Boarding, Lodging and Grocery. He served as the Director of the International Order of Odd Fellows which met in the building opposite the Johnson House. He also was a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Knights of Honor. He served as a volunteer fireman of Engine Company Number 1. As president of the board of trustees, he led the effort to get a bridge built over the Sacramento River near Chico. He also opposed the violent anti-Chinese movement in Chico, choosing instead to join with the Committee of One Hundred in efforts to limit Chinese immigration to Chico. In 1896, Johnson retired from public life, selling his grocery store and hotel. Over the next four years Johnson's health deteriorated and in 1900, he suffered two strokes. On December 16, 1900 Johnson suffered a serious paralytic stroke and by 2:00 in the afternoon on the following day he had died. He is buried in the Chico Cemetery.

It is the studio's first title and was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita. It is influenced by roguelike games and uses procedural generation for parts of the game. The game has two modes: Story mode follows a story and is more like a typical role-playing game, while Survival mode skips the story and focuses on the surviving within the game and constrains players with permadeath‚Äîonce the player character dies, the game must be restarted from the beginning. Gameplay Screenshot from the game Dragon Fin Soup is a role-playing game with roguelike qualities and graphics inspired by the Super NES, playing from a top-down, 2-dimensional perspective. Tactical combat and movement take place in turns, with both the player and enemies taking actions during each turn. The game includes scripted events and procedurally generated content. Two modes of play are available: Story mode has the player controlling the first playable character, Red Robin, as she works her way through a pre-scripted storyline in the vein of a typical role-playing game. Survival mode features permadeath gameplay, and starts players out in a forest where they must find supplies and fight through increasingly difficult randomly generated dungeons. The speed of gameplay matches the speed of the player; if the player moves quickly through the game world, then so do the enemies. A range of activities can be pursued including fishing, crafting, gathering, mining, digging, and cooking. Players have 20 slots in which to store equipment and other useful items, are able to dual-wield weapons, and can acquire pets to join them in the game. The world includes many different locations to explore including forests, caves, mines, deserts, mansions, castles, and ruins. The climate in the game is randomly generated which affects both the weather and earthquakes in each area. Plot The game takes place on Asura, a world situated on the back of an enormous dragon-turtle. The story follows Red Robin, an alcoholic yet cheerful mercenary, who drinks to forget events of her past. The game uses elements from fairy tales and legends including Robin Hood and Little Red Riding Hood. Development Concept art for the main character The game is the first title by the five person independent development studio Grimm Bros. The development studio was founded in March 2013 by Human Head Studios' former COO Ash Montif and by Randis Albion, an artist that previously worked on League of Legends, AquaNox: The Angel's Tears, and Magic: The Gathering. Development was part-funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. The campaign launched in March 2014 with an initial goal of US$24,000 to provide funding the base game. It concluded in April 2014 with $119,719 raised, achieving a stretch goal of porting the game to Sony platforms. As part of a 75-game wave of approvals, Valve accepted the game to be sold and distributed through their Steam software platform. As of December 2019, the game has been abandoned by its developers, and the promised \\"Extra Chunky Edition\\" and further updates have been indefinitely postponed. No official announcements were made, but the developers' online presences are no longer maintained.

Panel members use their senses to identify perceived similarities and differences in products, and articulate those perceptions in their own words. Sensory evaluation is a science that measures, analyzes, and interprets the reactions of the senses of sight, smell, sound, taste, and texture (or kinesthesis) to products. It is a people science; i.e., people are essential to obtain information about products. Tragon QDA is a registered trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The term was coined by Herbert Stone (a food scientist) and Joel L. Sidel (a psychologist) Stone, H., Sidel, J., Oliver, S., Woolsey, A., and Singleton, R. C., (1974). Sensory evaluation by quantitative descriptive analysis. Food Technol. 28(11), 24, 26, 28, 29, 32, 34. in 1974 while at the Stanford Research Institute, (now known as SRI International (SRI)). Stone and Sidel later founded Tragon Corporation, a successful spin-off of SRI, to develop and market QDA. Originally developed within the food industry, QDA is the basis of many disciplines that involve the senses, such as clothing, cosmetics, and electronics. Quantitative vs. qualitative research Many researchers view quantitative research design as the best approach to scientific research because it offers precise measurement and analysis. In quantitative research design the researcher will count and classify, and build statistical models to then explain what is observed. Data collected using this research approach is in the form of numbers and statistics. In the article entitled, ‚ÄúAn Analysis of the Strengths and Limitations of Qualitative and Quantitative Research Paradigms‚Äù, author Atieno (2009), suggests, ‚Äúquantitative research paradigm‚Ä¶is empirical in nature; it is also known as the scientific research paradigm‚Äù .

This research process includes a method of deductive reasoning by use of measurable tools to collect relevant data. Quantitative research then results in precise measurements. Key aspects of Quantitative Descriptive Analysis QDA is a behavioral approach that uses descriptive panels to measure a product's sensory characteristics. The key aspects of the methodology of Stone and Sidel are: * Subjects are consumers who are moderate to heavy users of the product. * Panels are a small number (e.g., 8 - 15) of experienced subjects. * Subjects are screened for sensitivity to product differences. * The subjects, not the researchers, formulate the descriptions in their own terms of the sensory attributes under study. For example, subjects may be asked to rate a mineral supplement in terms of its \\"bitterness\\" rather than its \\"alkalinity\\". * Data are collected from subjects without discussion among the subjects. * Quantitative, not qualitative, assessments are made. Subjective descriptions such as \\"like\\", \\"dislike\\", good\\", or \\"bad\\" are irrelevant. * Interval scales are used. Relative assessments are more important than absolute assessments. * Responses are often graphically implemented (n order to avert biases associated with some numbers) and are subsequently transformed to numerical assessments, such as on a scale of 0 - 60 or 0 - 100. * Products are presented for evaluation multiple times by the subjects. Replication allows for Analysis of Variation (ANOVA) to establish subject performance.

Because Barter's great grandmother, grandmother and mother all had breast cancer, she realized that there was a high likelihood that she would as well. At the time, she did not have any symptoms of the cancer but ovarian cancer had killed 903 Australians in 2011 and she did not want to be one of these people. Barter decided to have a preventative double mastectomy to remove both breasts and prevent getting this type of cancer. In 2009, Barter had her preventative double mastectomy when she was 25 years old. She was married with two young sons at the time and made the desion after wanting to be in their lives for many years to come. She was one of the first Australians to share her journey with the public to raise awareness that prevention is an option. Barter founded her organization, Pink Hope, from her hospital bed after her surgery. She wanted the struggles her family had gone through to help change and inform other people with hereditary cancer. Barter found Pink Hope to provide support and information to them because when she found out about her BRCA1 gene, and was considering a preventative mastectomy, she had no one to turn to for advice. \\"I was alone and isolated, there was nobody my age who making the choices,\\" Barter said. In regards to Pink Hope's mission she has also said: ‚ÄúHaving experienced the isolation and lack of information for high risk women like me, I decided to be proactive about helping others which lead to me creating Pink Hope. I have made it my personal mission to provide information, resources and support for the high risk community‚Äù. Later, in 2014, Barter also had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removed to dramatically reduce her risk for ovarian cancer. Barter is from Australia and is a wife, and mother of three. Her grandmother died after fighting recurring cancers for many years. She had a double mastectomy when she was 25 years old because her family had a history of cancer and she wanted to be sure she didn't develop it as well.

Background The family was typical of 16th-century families of artisans that passed the trade from father to son. During this period Swiss glass painting underwent a radical shift from predominantly architectural commissions to working within the Kabinettscheibe (independent panel), which was mostly commissioned by lay customers for installation in secular settings. The record of the Lindtmayer shows the increasing importance of the designer (Risser) who furnished drawings for execution by the glass painter, often for a variety of workshops.

He was also influenced by Tobias Stimmer, an engraver, who had a workshop in Schaffhausen and then moved to the cosmopolitan city of Basel. By 1575 Daniel Lindtmayer also moved to Basel and worked as a stained glass designer, whose work reflected the influences from around Switzerland and the Upper Rhine valley. He was acquitted of attempted murder of a Konstanz goldsmith on the grounds of insanity. From 1598 to about 1601, he lived in Lucerne. He died there between 1602 and 1607.

Her main research interests include ethics, moral psychology, action theory, and free will. She is professor of Philosophy at Brown University. Education and career Arpaly received a dual bachelor's from Tel Aviv University in 1992 in philosophy and linguistics, and a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University in 1998. She accepted a position as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor for the 1998‚Äì9 term, before accepting an Assistant Professorship at Rice University where she stayed in 2003. In 2003, she accepted an Assistant Professorship at Brown University, where she was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006, and then to Professor of Philosophy in 2014. Philosophical work Arpaly has authored three books: Unprincipled Virtue: an Inquiry into Human Agency (2002), Merit, Meaning, and Human Bondage ‚Äì an Essay on Free Will , and In Praise of Desire (2014). Additionally, she's written a number of peer-reviewed papers dealing with topics such as ethics, moral psychology, and action theory. In Unprincipled Virtue: an Inquiry into Human Agency, Arpaly sets out to develop a systematic way to determine whether an individual is blameworthy or praiseworthy. Arpaly engages with (and attempts to refute) a number of prominent philosophers who have dealt with the issue previously (including Kant and Aristotle,) but focuses foremost on developing her own theory of praiseworthiness, one in which people are praise (or blame)worthy for their acts in a way that varies with their moral motivations, and (in the case of blameworthiness) with the amount of their moral indifference ‚Äì a concept she sums up as ‚Äì Praiseworthiness as Responsiveness to Moral Reasons. Arpaly articulates a skeptical and deflationary view of the whole idea of autonomy, pointing out that at least eight separate notions of the idea of autonomy can be found in modern philosophical literature, and doubting that autonomy of any sort is needed for an action to be praiseworthy. One of the most significant contributions of Arpaly's book is simply that it lays out the flaws present in most former philosophical debate on the subject ‚Äì the use of overly simple and unnuanced models in previous discussions of praiseworthiness. One of the central claims of Unprincipled Virtue is that the assistance that Huckleberry Finn renders to Jim is morally worthy even though Huck actively believes that he is doing something wrong, and that akrasia can sometimes be a more rational state than individual autonomy.

Critical reception M. Suganth of The Times of India's gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Ramprakash Rayappa sets up his story effectively and keeps us on the edge of our seats for the most parts. The manner in which he handles this multi-strand narrative without making it chaotic deserves appreciation. The success lies in how he makes each of these sub-plots interesting\\", going on to call it a \\"solid debut film\\". Indo-Asian News Service, while giving the same rating and also describing it as a \\"solid social thriller\\", wrote, \\"(the) details, though minute, make the director stand out from his contemporaries. The writing is fresh and it‚Äôs evident from the way the director manages to make the parallelly running stories converge at the end...It‚Äôs probably the first Tamil film where a perfect balance is struck between science, romance and comedy interspersed with some fresh thrills\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"The deftness and confidence with which the director moves his narration belies the fact that this is his debut venture. The screenplay is engaging, with the characters well-fleshed out, and there is an element of suspense with humour laced throughout...One of the better scripts to appear in recent times, Thamizhuku Enn Ondrai Azhuthavum has a lot of positives going for it\\".

In contrast, Rediff gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Director Ramprakash has come up with a good idea, but the performance is poor, the romance seems forced, there are too many coincidences and a lame, predictable climax.

It is a sister company to the Ffestiniog Railway (FR), both organisations being owned by the Ffestiniog & Welsh Highland Railways Trust which is a registered charity. Profits go to support the preservation of the FR and Welsh Highland Railway (WHR). History Ffestiniog Travel‚Äôs origins lie with the FR when its base at Harbour Station in Porthmadog, North Wales, first became a train ticketing office for British Rail. The FR thus became more than just a heritage railway, and also issued tickets for travel not only to other local railway stations but further afield. Ffestiniog Travel continues to provide a ticket only service today. In 1973, the FR was appointed by British Rail‚Äôs Shipping and International Services Division to sell Sealink Ferries and Continental rail tickets. In order to meet BR‚Äôs sales target, the FR decided to sell as many tickets as possible on the longest Sealink Ferries route which was Harwich to the Hook of Holland. To do this it devised a group holiday via the Hook of Holland to the narrow gauge railways of the Swiss Alps for FR supporters. Hotel accommodation had to be arranged and onward rail journeys and a day-to- day itinerary established to ensure the tour included trips on the railway lines with Alpine scenery. This tour proved popular, with 68 bookings. And so, in October 1974, what was intended as a one-off tour to the Swiss Alps became the first of many rail holidays and Ffestiniog Travel was born. Operations A market was perceived for future tours and destinations. Scandinavia followed in April 1975 and there was another tour to Switzerland in September. A milestone was passed in 1979 when the first long haul tour (to Canada) was run. A new niche in independent rail travel was beginning to open up and in 1981 a small number of customers approached the company for tailor made arrangements. Ffestinog Travel was an integral part of the Commercial Department of the FR until 1992 when the decision was taken to make it a separate company, sister to the FR Company and wholly owned by the Festiniog & Welsh Highland Railways Trust. This was to give FT greater flexibility to develop its business beyond its traditional rail niche. The company is Ffestiniog Railway Holdings Ltd which trades as Ffestiniog Travel. Profits from FT‚Äôs operations continued to be used solely to benefit the FR by being covenanted to the Trust and ploughed back to the railway in the form of capital grants. The total amount donated since 1993 amounts to ¬£543k. This money has gone towards projects such as new carriages and renovation work at FR‚Äôs Harbour Station. Today FT runs 30 escorted rail tours each year around the UK, Europe and worldwide as well as arranging bespoke tailor made rail holidays for hundreds of travellers every year. The company also undertakes a lot of contract work for other organisations who require help to arrange a number of Special Interest Tours. These organisations supply the expert tour leader to lead the itinerary and FT arranges transport and accommodation. FT‚Äôs dedicated Ticket Only department also means the company is an authority on rail routes and rail operators around the world. All services are tightly controlled by European law which requires licences and bonds to protect customers‚Äô money. FT is a member of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO), holding an Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) licence and so provides a high level of security and financial protection to those travelling with the company. FT is committed to responsible travel and sustainable tourism and supports the Travel Foundation which is a UK charity that cares for the people and places that travellers love to visit. FT works in partnership with third party agents who also support sustainable tourism including Road, Rail & Sea. FT celebrates its 40th year in 2014 and enjoyed success when it received a commendation after being named runners-up in the Daily Telegraph Travel Awards 2013 in the Favourite Rail Tour Operator category.

He served as Minister of National Development in Viktor Orb√°n's third cabinet from 2014 to 2018. He was elected Member of Parliament for Kisv√°rda, Szabolcs- Szatm√°r-Bereg County in 2010. He is one of the vice presidents of the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP). Early career He was born into a Greek Catholic priestly family in Budapest on 31 October 1968. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE) in 1994. After that he has practiced as a trainee lawyer until his successful completion of the professional examination in 1996, when opened his own law firm in Kisv√°rda. Supported by mayor and Fidesz member Albert Ol√°h, he became involved in politics in 1998, when he was elected to the local government body of Kisv√°rda as a candidate of a local civic association. From 2002 to 2010, he was also a member of the General Assembly of Szabolcs-Szatm√°r-Bereg County. In the following years his relationship with Ol√°h became gradually conflictual; the Fidesz did not nominee Ol√°h for the position of mayor in the 2010 local elections. According to Ol√°h, Seszt√°k had a determining role in this decision. As Index.hu noted Seszt√°k had as much influence in the Kisv√°rda local government as parliamentary group leader J√°nos L√°z√°r in the National Assembly. As Member of Parliament, he joined the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) parliamentary group. Seszt√°k was a member of the Economic and Information Technology Committee between 2010 and 2014. He was elected Vice Chairman of the committee for brief time until his appointment as Minister of National Development in June 2014. According to his declaration of assets published in 2012, he was the second wealthiest MP after Socialist politician J√°nos Veres in that year. Iranian ICT minister Mahmoud Vaezi in Tehran in November 2015 In February 2013, Var√°nusz blog revealed from public data of parliamentary, registry court and National Development Agency (NF√ú) documents that Seszt√°k was simultaneously a member of the parliamentary subcommittees for Information Technology and Telecommunications and Procurement and Enterprise Regulatory and a member of the Supervisory Board of the Enternet Invest Ltd. in 2012, a company partially under Cypriot offshore control, when along with five companies controlled by as well as other Cypriot companies, registered under the same address, won 12.5 billion Hungarian forints (‚Ç¨45 million at the time) for the procurement of the National Development Agency for European funding for the Internet broadband in regions. Following critics by opposition MPs who claimed Seszt√°k has used his political influence and parliamentary positions to obtaining the tender, the Prime Minister's Office revoked the opaque part of the tender in October 2013 and terminated the contract concluded earlier in January 2013. In April 2014 the European Commission informed the government that the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) found indications of corruption following a complete investigation, as a result the entire amount has been withdrawn from the project. Minister of National Development Following the 2014 parliamentary election, Seszt√°k was appointed Minister of National Development in Viktor Orb√°n's newly formed third cabinet, replacing Zsuzsanna N√©meth. Seszt√°k was one of the two KDNP members (albeit also Fidesz politician) of the government, along with Deputy Prime Minister and party leader Zsolt Semj√©n during the inauguration. Seszt√°k told his key objectives as minister are strengthening the economy, development of the countryside and support for families. He appointed his state secretaries on 16 June 2014 (Administration: G√°bor Czepek, National Wealth: S√°ra Hegmann-Nemes, Parliamentary Affairs: J√°nos F√≥nagy, Energy: Andr√°s Aradszki, Climate Policy: Zsolt Szab√≥, Infrastructure: L√°szl√≥ Tas√≥). Few weeks after his appointment as minister, Index.hu revealed that Seszt√°k involved as a lawyer in establishing hundreds of short-lived companies and limited partnerships with Russian and Ukrainian background between 2001 and 2003 in Kisv√°rda, most of them abolished leaving behind public debts. Referring to the lawyers' professional secrecy, the press office of Seszt√°k's ministry has not responded in substance the content of the article. As a result, four opposition parties (Jobbik, Democratic Coalition, Politics Can Be Different and Together) demanded the minister's resignation or dismissal. Personal life Seszt√°k is married, he has two children. His wife, Mariann Seszt√°k- Berecz was owner in three firms in January 2016. The family lived in New Jersey between 2010 and 2011, Mikl√≥s Seszt√°k commuted between Hungary and the United States during that period. Seszt√°k also served as President of the Hungarian Chess Federation (MSSZ) from 2011 to 2015. He was replaced by his cousin Tam√°s Seszt√°k in that position in May 2015. Seszt√°k is also a supporter of local sports clubs, especially football team V√°rda SE (since 2013: Kisv√°rda FC).

It was established in 1929. The school offers VWO excluding or including the classical languages Latin and Greek, HAVO and VMBO-T. Ashram College is a Catholic school. History The Ashram College was established in 1929 as the H. Bonifacius-ulo. Students were taught at VMBO-level. Later, in 1971, the school expended and added a HAVO-level to its education system. In 1972, the school changed its name to Ashram College. In 1973, another expansion added the VWO-level to Ashram College. In 1974 the Ashram College merged with De Nieuwe Cope in Nieuwkoop. Values The Ashram College is a school based on catholic values. It aims to give inspiring, personal, creative and concerned education. Subjects In the first phase a student will go to one of the three main levels (there are in total 7 levels but those are made out of the main three). VWO - pre-university secondary education, excluding and including the classical languages Latin and Greek, HAVO - higher general continued education and VMBO- preparatory middle-level vocational education√Æ. The Ashram College gives the opportunity to choose alternative subjects, for example Chinese. At the gymnasium subjects like philosophy and \\"Research & Design\\" are included. The student have to choose an additional course on their own, which they will practise four hours in the week. The choices in Alphen aan den Rijn are ‚ÄòArtClass‚Äô, based on theater, art and music, ‚ÄòSportlife‚Äô, including many sports, ‚ÄòMondo‚Äô, reserved for \\"curious students\\" and ‚ÄòThe Young Researcher‚Äô), intended for the inquiring pupil. In Nieuwkoop a student can choose between ‚ÄòBeauty & Wellness‚Äô, ‚ÄòSportLife‚Äô, ‚ÄòTechnique‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Theater Factory‚Äô). In the second phase a student can choose a 'profile' of his choice, which offers most of the subjects the student is interested in, or suit his capacities. The following profiles can be selected: * Culture and society - emphasizes arts and foreign languages. The mathematical classes focus on statistics and stochastics. This profile prepares for artistic and cultural training. * Economy and society - emphasizes social sciences, economics and history. The mathematical classes focus on statistics and stochastics. This profile prepares for management and business administration. * Nature and health - emphasizes biology and natural sciences. The mathematics classes focus on algebra, geometry and calculus. This profile is necessary to attend medical training. * Nature and technology - emphasizes natural sciences. The mathematics classes focus on algebra, geometry and calculus. This profile is necessary to attend technological and natural science training. Beside this profile, a student can also choose another subject of his choice: music (only VWO), Spanish (only VWO), visual arts, informatics, economy (if not included in the profile of the student's choice), philosophy, French, German and acting (only VMBO and HAVO). Exceptional VWO students are able to choose an extra subject, but they are only permitted to do that if they have great marks for that specific subject. Name The name Ashram refers to the Indian ashrams, places where everyone could come to. The particular reason that makes an ashram unique was that origin, religion, study, skin color, etc. do not matter. This is exactly what is predicated in the school, that everyone in this world is equal to each other and that a school should support every individual in their talent. Due to this fact, the motto of the school is ‚ÄòThuis in de wereld‚Äô, literally ‚ÄòHome in the world‚Äô.

Sage's mother was killed in the crash, and Sage was left with a large scar across her cheek, which is a constant reminder that she was responsible for her mother's death. Sage is self-conscious about her facial scar, and chooses to wear her hair across her face in order to hide it. Sage works nights, alone, as a baker, as she believes that she deserves a lonely life. Sage believes that her sisters, Pepper and Saffron, blame her for their mother's death, so she actively avoids contact with them. Her best friend is Mary D'Angelis, an ex-nun who owns Our Daily Bread, the bakery where Sage works. Sage is in a relationship with the local funeral director, Adam, who also happens to be married. Initially, Sage seems to be fine with their arrangement, as it allows her to live independently. Although Sage's family is deeply Jewish, she refers to herself as an atheist. Sage, recently began attending a grief group, where she meets an elderly man, Josef Weber. Josef is widely known around town for being a kind and generous man. He and his wife lived in Westerbrook for 40 years, though his wife recently died. Josef is seen by many in their town as a model citizen, as he was the long time German teacher at the high school, as well as the baseball coach. After Josef and Sage become close friends, he reveals a secret about his past; he was a Nazi commander in the Holocaust at the Auschwitz concentration camp and asks Sage if she will help him die. Josef tells Sage that he committed horrific crimes and killed many people. He asks her to help him die by suicide. Sage is conflicted by the request, and after much deliberation, she calls the local police department, and tells them she has discovered a Nazi. Sage is referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, and is directed to Leo Stein, the individual in control of Holocaust-related things in the U.S. Leo, who is immediately attracted to Sage, tells her how difficult it will be to verify that Josef is actually telling the truth, and that it will be exponentially more difficult to convict him of his crimes. Leo is also skeptical of Sage's story as he does not believe that a Nazi would simply confess his crimes 70 years later. Leo investigates \\"Josef Weber\\" and finds that no such SS guard by that name existed, but under much coaxing from Sage, Josef confesses his real name was Reiner Hartmann, who was indeed an officer at Auschwitz. Over time Sage is able to gather bits and pieces of information (photographs, dates, people, places, documents) from Josef and she gives it to Leo. Leo is able to confirm that the information provided by Josef was accurate, though not enough to prove that Josef is who he says he is. In order to prove that Josef is Reiner, Sage must uncover information from Josef that only Reiner would know (such as a confession to some of his personal crimes that nobody else would know about). Sage's grandmother, Minka, is a Holocaust survivor and was imprisoned at Auschwitz. After much persuading, Leo manages to convince Minka to open up about her past. Minka tells of her time in Poland as a teenager, moving into a ghetto, and then being imprisoned at Auschwitz, as well as how she ultimately survived. Minka begins to explain a story that she began writing in childhood with her best friend Darija and carried on writing throughout her time in Auschwitz. She continued writing as a survival tactic for herself and for those she was imprisoned with. However, an SS guard, known as Franz Hartmann, expressed interest in the story as he believed that it explained the complex relationship he had with his brother. Franz offers Minka small comforts such as warmth and food scraps in exchange for 10 pages of the story each day. One day, Franz, accompanied by Darija, who had been smuggled in to keep Minka warm, catches Franz's cruel older brother Reiner, Franz's superior, stealing money out of the safe that was originally taken from dead prisoners. To prevent Minka from turning him in, Reiner shoots Darija in the face, killing her instantly, and blames Minka for the theft. Minka is promptly sent from Auschwitz to a death march in 1944, which she manages to survives. With Leo and Sage returning the following day with photographs of Nazi generals, Minka is able to positively identify one of the guards as Reiner Hartmann, stating \\"I would never forget the man that murdered my best friend\\". In order to have Josef arrested and extradited, an eyewitness account was needed, something that only Reiner would know, so Sage is sent by Leo to talk to Josef, wearing a wire to record his confession(s). When Sage asks what the worst thing he ever did was, he replies that it was killing Darija, and then blaming Minka for the theft. Josef explains how the bullet was actually meant for Minka, but hit Darija instead as he had an unstable hand. This confession deeply upsets Sage, and having obtained the material she needed, she immediately leaves Josef's house. Not long after hearing Josef's confession, Sage receives a call saying that Josef is in the hospital from an attempted suicide attempt. Sage begins to ponder her relationship with Adam, after running into him with his arm around his wife in a cafe while she was with Leo. Sage cuts ties with Adam, as she comes to realize that she is not happy being \\"the other woman\\". Adam, trying to recover their relationship, goes to Sage's home and proposes, telling her that he is filling for divorce so he can marry her, but she tells him to leave. While Josef is in the hospital, Sage learns that her grandmother Minka has died in her sleep, which Sage blames herself for, as she thinks that making her discuss the Holocaust caused her great stress and upset. At Minka's wake, Sage is overwhelmed by the number of people present, so Leo takes her away to a hotel, where the two of them become intimate and enter into a relationship. Upon Josef's release from hospital, Sage decides to help him achieve his final wish. After an in-depth chat with Mary about forgiveness, Sage decides she cannot forgive Josef for the crimes he committed. Josef further confesses to Sage that the worst crime he ever committed was not Darija's murder, but watching his brother choke to death in front of him and choosing not to save him. Sage eventually poisons Josef with a pastry with Monkshood inside instead of cinnamon and chocolate. Josef's last words are \\"how does it end\\", with Sage replying \\"like this\\" and leaving, not realizing that the words were in fact about Minka's story, which she never completed. Once Sage returns home, she discovers that the hospital wristband Josef was wearing states his blood type as B+, although Reiner's was known to be AB. After rifling through his possessions, Sage also finds the story that her grandmother wrote during her time in Auschwitz on the back of photos of dead Jews, which had been taken by Reiner's brother, Franz, who had made up his own ending to the story as he was desperate for closure. Sage suddenly realises that Josef Weber was not Reiner Hartmann, but his younger brother Franz, and that she killed a man who was not who she thought he was. Nonetheless, Sage realizes that Franz's conscience was not clear either, as he was still an SS officer.

After attending the local schools, he went to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School in 1878. Theodor Hagen and Alexander Struys were among his teachers. After trying several styles, he decided to devote himself to landscape painting. Before graduating, however, he had to quit school for financial reasons. In 1880 and 1881, he took lessons to pass the drawing teacher exams with Karl Gussow at the Prussian Academy of Arts. Despite this, he remained unemployed. Returning to Kammerforst, he supported himself with an occasional odd job. In 1883, he was able to study at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin, thanks to a generous stipend from and Ernst Ewald. He acquired skills in landscape, portrait, and decorative painting, receiving several awards. In 1886 and 1887, he took a study trip to Italy.

History  = Early Bulgarian jazz = After the bloody Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising of 1903 there was a wave of Bulgarian immigrants to the USA and Canada, mostly in the Eastern states, setting in communities that established their own social institutions - churches, political clubs, newspapers, and other societies, among which amateur orchestras had an important role. They were predominantly brass bands, though there were some string (guitar and mandolin) orchestras. Most of the musicians could not read music. Returning to Bulgaria as volunteers in the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913, they brought back the new music of America.Gadjev, Vladimir. \\"Purvite Bulgarski Orkestri v Amerika.\\" Ek (n.d.): 13-15. Print. One of the early first-hand experiences of music influenced by jazz was Wallace Hartley‚Äôs band concert in Varna in 1911.Nikolov, Dimitar. \\"Dirigentat Na 'Titanik' Donasya Dzhaza W Bulgaria.\\" Novinar. Novinar, 29 Nov. 2010. Web. 22 Apr. 2014. . His success there acquired him a position at a club in the capital Sofia, where he played primarily dance music until being hired to play on the Titanic in 1912. His influence marks the beginning of the influx of western music, at that time predominantly ragtime, in Bulgaria.Gadjev, Vladimir. \\"Plah Poluh Prez 10-te Godini.\\" Dzhaz≈≠t v B≈≠lgariiÔ∏†aÔ∏°, B≈≠lgarite v Dzhaza: Now's the Time 1911-1991.

As early as the 1920s there was Bulgarian instrumental music that could be classified as jazz but was also influenced by folk traditions, often even in the choice of instrumentation. = Between the wars = In the years following the First World War there was an increased demand for entertainment, as well as a second big wave of returning emigrants from the Great Depression. Many of them decided to take up music as their profession, bringing to Bulgaria some experience and repertoire of American music. Those were years of increased industrialization and urbanization for Bulgaria, which also stimulated the growth of the entertainment industry. The first big jazz formations appeared at a time when public houses flourished and silent cinema provided work for orchestras. Jazz spread further with the import of notated western jazz music and records. There were several active jazz orchestras, performing mostly swing music, such as ‚ÄúJazz Ovcharov‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Optimists‚Äù.Levy, Claire. \\"Diversifying the Groove: Bulgarian Folk Meets the Jazz Idiom.\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary Music Studies 1.2 (2007): 25-42. Web. 22 Apr. 2014. = Jazz under communism = After the Second World War, as Bulgaria was under communist rule, music and all art was subjected to a set of criteria that was not compatible with the free nature of jazz, nor with the rawness of improvised instrumental folk music that could naturally fit within the jazz aesthetic. In the aesthetic set by the government, folklore was only acceptable as an inspiration that after undergoing the process of refinement in the European style could become part of creating the ‚Äúnational musical style.‚Äù The totalitarian rule resulted in a relative artistic stagnation in which amusement and musical experimentation were frowned upon. During that period emerged one of the first prominent figures in Bulgarian jazz, Milcho Leviev, a composer, conductor, arranger, and piano player, whose career started with directing and occasionally composing and arranging for the Bulgarian radio and television big band between 1962 and 1966. Due to his personal connections (most notably with his teacher from the conservatory, classical composer Pancho Vladigerov) and other fortunate circumstances, Leviev was able to overcome some of the aesthetic conservatism. He found folk music tradition, with the asymmetrical complex rhythms, distinctive melodic motifs, and emphasis on virtuosity and improvisation typical for Bulgarian music, to be a logical choice to translate into jazz.Levy, Claire. Parody Rhetoric, Intertextuality and the Groovy Aesthetics in Bulgarian Jazz. Institute of Art Studies - Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, n.d. N.p.: n.p., n.d. One of the first compositions exploring that direction is his piece Blues in 9, based on a Bulgarian folk dance rhythm pattern and turning the familiar structures from both folk and jazz into something completely different. For him using asymmetric Bulgarian meters and the unusual melodic intervals typical to Bulgarian folk music was not just an attempt to towards the unusual, but aiming to evoke specific associations of those popular metric structures. His style also marked the first steps towards blending extremities in musical classification - rough folk and refined classical, serious art music and entertainment music, composer‚Äôs and performer‚Äôs music. Leviev‚Äôs music was a criticism of the totalitarian regime and its conservative aesthetic and with that he attracted like-minded musicians and other artists that he collaborated with, including the famous poet Radoy Ralin, who encouraged him to form the Bulgarian Jazz Quartet. Also known as Jazz Focus ‚Äò65, the quartet consisted of Milcho Leviev on piano, Simeon Shterev on flute, Lyubomir Mitsov on contrabass, and Petur Slavov on percussion. The group gained some international acclaim after winning the critics' award in the jazz festival in Montreux, Switzerland. Despite its success abroad, the music of the quartet was not in favour in Bulgaria, where on occasion it had been banned as ‚Äúpolitically inappropriate.‚Äù In 1968 the quartet recorded an album beyond the Iron Curtain in FRG, free of the aesthetic restraints of communism. In the same year he contacted the American bandleader Don Ellis, sending him recordings of Bulgarian folk music, including Sadovsko horo, a folk dance tune in 33/16, which Ellis rearranged and released under the title ‚ÄúBulgarian Bulge.‚Äù This resulted in a yearlong collaboration between Leviev and Ellis, during which Leviev moved to the US to compose, arrange, and play piano for Ellis‚Äô band.Scott Yanow and Barry Kernfeld. \\"Leviev, Milcho.\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd ed. Ed. Barry Kernfeld. Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Apr. 2014. . One of the most significant Bulgarian jazz singers is Lea Ivanova. Between 1940 and 1955 she sang for various big bands including \\"Slavyanska beseda,\\" \\"Jazz Ovcharov,\\" and \\"The Optimists,\\" singing predominantly in the style of swing. The beginning of the 1950s marks a difficult time for jazz bands and she was forced to change situation more often, gaining fame as a singer for various orchestras in the capital. 1957 marks the beginning of her 30-year-long partnership with Edi Kazasyan, who later became her husband. Singing for his orchestra, she toured Europe extensively, becoming popular outside Bulgaria. During the totalitarian regime, there was a ban on her music in Bulgaria. Because of artistic censorship she was also imprisoned and put in a labor camp. After being released she suffered a stroke and was not able to sing almost until the end of her life, though she was able to recover her ability to speak. Later in her life she received some recognition for her contributions to Bulgarian jazz.Rupchev, Yordan, and Nikola Ivanov. \\"Biography.\\" Lea Ivanova - Primata Na Swinga. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Apr. 2014. . = Wedding music and its influence on Bulgarian jazz = Bulgarian village weddings were traditionally accompanied by music performed by the villagers, often singing and playing along with the gypsies. After the Second World War, professional wedding bands started being employed. The folk instruments traditionally used by those orchestras were increasingly western brass and woodwind instruments, associated with jazz.Rice, Timothy. \\"Music and Politics.\\" Music in Bulgaria: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture. New York: Oxford UP, 2004. 56-74. Print. Professional wedding bands that blended Bulgarian folk and gypsy music with the inevitable western influences became increasingly popular in the '80s. Though not in itself strictly jazz music their music was similar with its syncretism, improvisatory character, and reiteration of old well-known melodies into something new.Levy, Claire. \\"Folk in Opposition? Wedding Bands and the New Developments in Bulgarian Popular Music.\\" Music and Politics III.1 (2009): n. pag. Print. That tradition gave rise to several influential musicians who set out to use their traditional folk instruments playing contemporary jazz that blended the western music with Balkan influences such as the unusual timbres, complex, and often asymmetrical meters, unusual for western music melodies and often passionate aggressive style of playing. Bulgarian clarinetist Ivo Papazov and his band do not deviate too much from the wedding band music style, though they are active performers at jazz festivals as well as the countryside. They have recorded several albums which have been received well internationally. Blending jazz and folk music is only successful when the player has a good familiarity with both styles. One of the leading musicians of that style is Teodosii Spassov, whose initial interest in music was sparked by a folk music player in his native village. His unique sound in playing kaval has been compared to the sound of a flute, clarinet, and oboe. He is also the first to play the folk instrument with a symphonic orchestra and a big band.\\"Teodosii Spasov: Muzikata E Bozhestvena Igra, Dadena Na Choveka, Za Da Se Razviva Duhovno.\\" Interview by Mariya Zaharieva. Bulgari June 2008: 22-27. Print. Its development was encouraged by the Western interest for the characteristic folk music of regional cultures. While during the communist regime folk music influences were considered a bad direction of development, the post-communist musicians were able to discern its potential for connecting with the people on a spiritual level, calling to mind tradition and connection with symbols of nature and community. In that sense Teodosii Spassov's music, as well as the other jazz musicians relying heavily on folklore instrumentation and musical elements are continuing the trend started by Milcho Leviev in the early 1960s. Teodosii Spassov has received international acclaim for his musicianship and versatility as a performer and numerous composition awards.\\"Biography.\\" Theodosii Spassov - Official Web Site. N.p., 2014. Web. 22 Apr. 2014. . = Jazz festivals after 1989 = By the end of the 1980s there was a noticeable difference in the artistic freedom that musicians could afford to have, and this was especially important for jazz music. As the recording industry in the country was fairly insignificant, the music industry was focused on concerts and festivals. Since the 1990s the development and popularity of Bulgarian jazz can be best tracked by following jazz festivals, especially since many of them have a consistent style and recurring performers from year to year.Atanasova, Bogdana. Dzhazovi Festivali v Bulgaria Sled 1989 - Nai-novata Istoriya Na Bulgarskiya Dzhaz. Diss. Music Department, New Bulgarian U, 2013. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. The festival \\"Varna Summer\\" was initiated in 1992 and is the oldest jazz festival created after 1989 that is still active. It was first held under the direction of Anatoli Vapirov, a classically trained jazz clarinetist, saxophonist and conductor. The music at the \\"Varna Summer\\" jazz festival is characterized by virtuosity, experimentation, and variety. One of the Haskovo jazz festival's main supporters is the jazz guitar player, Dimitar Roussev. The festival is designed to attract visitors to Haskovo, even international guests. The audience is barely enough to support the festival, however. Organizers often rely on donations from local companies. This is the reason why they rely on the same popular performers and cannot afford to include more experimental music in their program. The Jazz Festival in Bansko is the most popular one, partially because the mountain town is a tourist attraction in itself. In the year 2012 there were more than 28,000 guests present. The festival \\"Plovdiv Jazz Evenings\\" is financed by the Plovdiv township. This allows the festival to feature a wide variety of Bulgarian and international performers, which has gained the event a lot of popularity for its short history. The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, is known to have two jazz festivals. Both of them consist of individual concert events rather than being an actual festival. Both of them are relatively open to performers from styles other than jazz.

By 1924, he was working with Burton Holmes and eventually struck out on his own as an independent producer with a short film series called ‚ÄúScreen Traveler‚Äù in the thirties. Locales included Sumatra, Java, Bali, Philippines, France, the Mediterranean region, Netherlands, Austria, Egypt and Palestine. With Harold Autin and Paul B. Devlin contributing as producers, these highly professional travelogues received wider distribution by Nu-Art in 1936 and enjoyed a second life as educational material in public schools, being reissued for copyright in the 1950s. Columbia Pictures commissioned him to provide material for a number of their own documentary shorts starting in 1939, recycling some footage he shot earlier in France as well as new material scouted mostly in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean on account of the war in Europe. A typical reel, well received in 1942 by BoxOffice magazine, was Cajuns of the Teche, covering Louisiana's local culture. It was with Warner Brothers that he was at his most prolific and most polished. His long association with that studio began with his early 1943 covering (the simply titled) Snow Sports of Lake Placid, New York and the Tropical Sportland of Florida; by now, he was working in full Technicolor. These one-reel Sports Parade and two-reel Technicolor Specials benefited greatly from rousing studio orchestra scores (many by Howard Jackson and William Lava) and additional writing by Owen Crump, among other seasoned studio veterans. Strong narration by radio familiars Art Gilmore and Marvin Miller were an added plus. A 1949-filmed Palio di Siena, Grandad of Races, was an Academy Award winner. Other notable titles include That‚Äôs Bully, covering the Running of the bulls in Pamplona (filmed '48 and released early ‚Äô50), Emperor's Horses (featuring the Lippizaner in Austria, 1951), Carnival in Rio (1953) and Who‚Äôs Who In The Zoo (1954). In 1954, he started shooting them also in CinemaScope for Warner‚Äôs Scope Gem series, culminating in a couple made in India, Burma and Thailand. One of several covering Germany, Time Stood Still, was Oscar-nominated in early 1957. He returned to Burton Holmes Inc. shortly before the founder‚Äôs passing in 1958 and was soon busy with lengthy features like 1965‚Äôs Grand Tour of London and Paris (by Day and by Night). Collaborating on many of these was his son Andr√© De La Varre Jr. (There were at least two more travelogues of Switzerland added to Warner‚Äôs program, one holding the distinction of being Warner's final theatrical short release in 1970.) Despite financial problems with the Burton Holmes company and a shrinking market for travelogues, he still managed another well-received 90 minute feature These States for the Bicentennial Council in 1975. His later years were spent in Austria.

The historical region they occupied is called Rovca. History In 1768, the Rovƒçani helped the Bjelopavliƒái which were attacked by the Ottomans.Barjaktaroviƒá 1984, p. 28 In 1774, Mehmet Bushatli, the pasha of Scutari, broke into Kuƒçi and \\"destroyed\\" it; the Rovƒçani housed and protected some of the refugee families. On the request of Russian Empress Catherine, the Montenegrins and Herzegovinians took arms against the Ottomans in 1788. The call was gladly accepted by the Rovƒçani and Moraƒçani who equipped gunpowder and weapons for the upcoming events. However, the Ottomans heard of the intentions, and preemptively struck Moraƒça, the centre of preparation. In 1794, the Kuƒçi and Rovƒçani were devastated by the Ottomans. In 1796, the Montenegrin army under Metropolitan Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° with the assistance of Piperi defeated the Ottoman army at the Battle of Krusi. The Montenegrin victory resulted in territorial expansion, with the tribes of Bjelopavliƒái and Piperi being joined into the Montenegrin state. The Rovƒçani, as other highlander tribes, subsequently turned more and more towards the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro.Barjaktaroviƒá 1984, p. 29 Metropolitan Petar I sent letters in 1799 to the Moraƒçani and Rovƒçani, advising them to live peacefully and in solidarity. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì13), the Drobnjaci, Moraƒçani, Rovƒçani, Uskoci and Pivljani rose against the Ottomans and burnt down villages in Herzegovina. The Rovca and Lower and Upper Moraƒça tribes were incorporated into Montenegro only in 1820, after the defeat of the Ottoman army at the Moraƒça river, and Vasojeviƒái even later, in 1858. Rovƒçani was one of the tribes that supported the Montenegrin Greens, a faction that opposed what they saw was an annexation of Montenegro to Serbia and instead urged for a federation. The Greens still declared themselves to be ethnic Serbs. During the Christmas Uprising (January 7, 1919) two members of Bulatoviƒá family were flayed alive in Rovca by the Montenegrin Whites (the other political faction). Politics The Rovƒçani tribe had historically viewed themselves as Serbs, and in light of Montenegrin independence (2006), Rovca clan chief Nikola Miniƒá said that \\"If Milo Djukanovic tried to divide Montenegro... we wouldn't live in his country... but remain united in a brotherhood with Serbia.\\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/correspondent/transcripts/861500.txt Anthropology According to local folklore, recalled by a Bulatoviƒá, the Rovca tribe ultimately descend from ban (duke) Ilijan, from Grbalj in the Bay of Kotor. This Ilijan allegedly married Jevrosima, the daughter of Grand Prince Vukan (r. 1202‚Äì04) and sister of Stefan Vukanoviƒá Nemanjiƒá, who built the Moraƒça monastery. Ilijan had a son, Nik≈°a, who was in conflict with ban Ugren of the Nik≈°iƒá ≈æupa (county). Nik≈°a's son Gojak murdered Ugren, after which he was hid in the Moraƒça monastery by his great-uncle (or uncle) Stefan, and then in the Lukavica mountain, where he is believed to have died. Gojak had fours sons: Bulat (whose descendants are known as Bulatoviƒái), ≈†ƒáepan (whose descendants are known as ≈†ƒáepanoviƒái), Vlaho (whose descendants are known as Vlahoviƒái) and Srezoje (whose descendants are known as Srezojeviƒái).

She was named for Buckingham, Quebec. She is considered a significant part of Canadian naval history as used for some early trials of helicopter landings on smaller escort vessels. This led to the development of the future helicopter carrying destroyers. Buckingham was ordered 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down as Royal Mount on 11 November 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 28 April 1944. Her name was changed to Buckingham and she was commissioned on 2 November 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin- screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the . The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history Buckingham returned to Halifax after working up at Bermuda in January 1945 and was assigned to the convoy escort group EG 28. She remained with this unit until the end of hostilities in Europe performing local escort duties for coastal convoys along the eastern coast of Canada. On 10 May, was spotted south of Newfoundland by a RCAF airplane, steaming at and flying a black flag of surrender. The RCAF plane radioed to nearby Western Escort Force W-6 who intercepted the submarine an hour later. U-889 was ordered to head to Bay Bulls, Newfoundland. 24 hours later U-889 was turned over to the frigates Buckingham and who escorted her to Shelburne Harbour where she was boarded. In June 1945, Buckingham began a tropicalization refit at Liverpool, Nova Scotia in preparation for service in the Pacific Ocean. She moved to Shelburne to complete it however it was suspended before the work was done due to the Surrender of Japan. She was paid off 16 November 1945 at Sydney and placed in reserve. =Postwar service= Buckingham was sold to Marine Industries Ltd. in 1946. She was reacquired by the RCN to undergo conversion to a Prestonian- class ocean escort from 1953‚Äì1954. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti- submarine mortars. Buckingham recommissioned at Montreal on 25 June 1954 with the pennant number 314. Upon return to service, Buckingham was used for training purposes and assigned to . In the summer of 1956, the Royal Canadian Navy believed that flying a helicopter equipped for anti-submarine warfare could be \\"married\\" to an existing anti-submarine platform such as a destroyer or frigate. To prove this, the RCN attached a small landing pad aft to Buckingham in October‚ÄìDecember 1956 and attempted to land a Sikorsky HO4S-3 on it. The attempts were successful and the pad was removed and tested again on the larger . These trials demonstrated that a helicopter could be landed and would lead to the development of the Beartrap, a mechanism designed by the RCN to keep the helicopter attached to the deck once it had landed. In 1961, the frigate was a member of the Ninth Canadian Escort Squadron. In June 1961, Buckingham toured the Great Lakes, making several port visits. Buckingham served until paid off on 23 March 1965. She was sold for scrap and broken up at La Spezia, Italy in 1966. References =Notes= =References=  Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. Since Bird‚Äôs 2015 debut season, his career has been plagued by a variety of injuries. Bird missed the entire 2016 campaign and played a mere 173 games with the Yankees and their respective minor league affiliates, between 2017 and 2019. Amateur career Bird attended Grandview High School in Aurora, Colorado, where he played for the baseball team as a catcher and formed a battery with pitcher Kevin Gausman. Bird was named the Colorado Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year as a senior. He committed to attend the University of Arkansas to play college baseball for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Professional career =Minor leagues= Bird was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Bird signed with the Yankees, receiving a $1.1 million signing bonus and bypassing his commitment to Arkansas. He was drafted as a catcher but was moved to first base. Bird made his professional debut for the Gulf Coast Yankees in 2011. He finished the season playing in four games, going 1 for 12. In 2012, he played in only 28 games due to injuries. He finished the season hitting .337/.450/.494 with two home runs. Bird started the 2013 season with the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. He finished the season, hitting .288/.428/.511 with 20 home runs and a minor league leading 107 walks. He won the Kevin Lawn Award as the Yankees Minor League Player of the Year. In 2014, Bird began the season with the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where he batted .277 with seven home runs and 32 runs batted in before he was promoted tor the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League, where he batted for a .253/.379/.558 triple slash to go along with seven homers and 11 RBI to create a full season equaling .271/.376/.472 slash line, 14 homers, and 43 RBI in 102 games. After the season, the Yankees assigned Bird to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL). He hit a home run during the AFL Fall Stars Game. Bird led the AFL with six home runs was named the AFL Most Valuable Player. Bird started the 2015 season with Double-A Trenton and was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League during the season. In May, he experienced a shoulder injury. =Major leagues= New York Yankees =2015: Rookie season= Bird batting for the Yankees in 2015 On August 13, 2015, the Yankees announced that they would promote Bird to the major leagues, serving as a backup to Mark Teixeira at first base and Alex Rodriguez at designated hitter. He made his major league debut that night, going 0-for-5. He collected his first hit on August 15, a single off of Toronto Blue Jays reliever LaTroy Hawkins. Teixeira injured his leg during a hit-by-pitch on August 17, which was later diagnosed as a season-ending shin fracture. As a result, Bird became the Yankees' starting first baseman for the rest of 2015. On August 19, Bird hit his first two MLB home runs off of Minnesota Twins pitcher Ervin Santana. On September 7, Bird hit a go-ahead three-run home run in a game against the Baltimore Orioles.

In 46 games and 157 at-bats, Bird hit 11 home runs with 31 RBIs. =2016= Bird suffered a recurrence of his right shoulder injury during the 2015-16 offseason, which was diagnosed as a torn labrum. Bird underwent successful surgery, and was ruled out for the entire 2016 MLB season. After not playing during the regular season, Bird recovered from his shoulder injury in time to be assigned to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League in October 2016. =2017= In spring training, Bird showed a full recovery from his season-ending shoulder surgery, hitting eight home runs, tied for the most with Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper. He also led the league in extra-base hits (16), on-base percentage (.556), slugging percentage (1.098) and OPS (1.654). During an exhibition game against the Atlanta Braves, Bird hit the first-ever home run in SunTrust Park. On May 2, Bird was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a bruised right ankle. His performance was hampered due to an injury he sustained after fouling a ball of his foot at the end of Spring Training, batting .100 in 19 games. In July, Bird was diagnosed with an injury to the os trigonum in his right foot; he would have surgery to remove the bone. On August 26, Bird was activated of the 60-day DL after missing 103 games and went 1-for-2 with two walks in a game that afternoon. Since his return from injury, Bird batted .253 and hit 8 home runs. In 48 games played in 2017, Bird batted .190 with 9 home runs and 28 RBI. In Game 3 of the ALDS, Bird hit a solo home run off of Cleveland Indians reliever and former Yankee Andrew Miller, only the second home run Miller had allowed on a fastball to a lefty in the last three seasons. It was the only run scored in the game as the Yankees won 1‚Äì0. Bird served as the final out in Game 7 of the ALCS against the Houston Astros, flying out to center to eliminate the Yankees from World Series contention. In the postseason, Bird slashed .244/.426/.512 with three home runs and 6 RBIs; he was also thrown out at home plate twice. =2018= On March 26, 2018, it was revealed that Bird would undergo ankle surgery, ruling him out for six to eight weeks. He underwent successful surgery the next day, and it was revealed to be a small bone spur. A coin- sized calcium deposit was also removed from the ankle. This was the second time Bird had ankle surgery; a different problematic bone was removed from the ankle the previous summer. Bird returned from his ankle surgery on May 26, 2018. Bird struggled in 2018 batting .199/.286/.386 with 11 home runs and 38 RBIs and lost his starting job to Luke Voit late in the season. =2019= On April 16, Bird was placed on the 10-day IL with a left plantar fascia tear, prompting the Yankees to call up first baseman Mike Ford. He was transferred to the 60-day IL on May 12. Bird would go on to miss the rest of the 2019 season. Bird finished the season hitting .171 in 35 at bats. On November 20, 2019, the Yankees designated Bird for assignment. He became a free agent on November 27. Texas Rangers On February 4, 2020, Bird signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. On July 31, 2020, Bird was brought back to MLB once he was recalled by the Texas Rangers.

The historical tribes of Brda: Vasojeviƒái, Bjelopavliƒái, Piperi, Kuƒçi, Bratono≈æiƒái, Moraƒça and Rovca constituted this region (collectively known as \\"the seven tribes\\" or \\"hills\\"; –°–µ–¥–∞–º –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞/Sedam plemena or –°–µ–¥–∞–º –±—Ä–¥–∞/Sedam brda / –°–µ–¥–º–æ—Ä–æ –±—Ä–¥–∞/Sedmoro brda), known as the Highlander tribes (Montenegrin and Serbian: –ë—Ä–¥—Å–∫–∞ –ø–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω–∞/Brdska plemena), or simply Highlanders (–ë—Ä—í–∞–Ω–∏/Brƒëani), before the late 19th- and early 20th century and full independence of Montenegro.  Geography  Today, the Brda region geographically includes the central- eastern, eastern and north-eastern parts of the territory of the highlands in the higher mountainous Montenegro. The territory is approximately 3500 km¬≤, in which ca. 100,000 people live today. The region includes the northern part of Podgorica with settlements Masline, Zlatica, Zagoriƒç and Rogami, and neighbourhood Spu≈æ, and cities Danilovgrad, Kola≈°in, Berane and Andrijevica, and also villages such as Bioƒçe, Murina and Mate≈°evo.  History  The Gorska ≈æupa (\\"mountainous county\\") was mentioned in Stefan the First-Crowned's charter to the ≈Ωiƒça monastery (1220), with the town of Goliƒç. With the Ottoman conquest, parts of the region was organized into the Sanjak of Montenegro (1514‚Äì28) and Sanjak of Scutari. The burning of Saint Sava's remains after the Banat Uprising provoked the Serbs in other regions to revolt against the Ottomans. In 1596, an uprising broke out in Bjelopavliƒái, then spread to Drobnjaci, Nik≈°iƒá, Piva and Gacko (see Serb Uprising of 1596‚Äì97). It was suppressed due to lack of foreign support. Venetian public servant Mariano Bolizza's 1614 report the Kuƒçi, Bratono≈æiƒái and part of Plava were under the soldiers of Medun, the spahee, but the commander was not named; and the highlanders would pay the Ottoman officials a portion of their income.Elsie, p. 152 Between 1614 and 1621 the Kuƒçi were mentioned as Ottoman subjects. In 1658, the seven tribes of Kuƒçi, Vasojeviƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Piperi, Klimenti, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice, establishing the so-called \\"Seven-fold barjak\\" or \\"alaj-barjak\\", against the Ottomans. It is claimed that S√ºleyman Pasha managed to penetrate into Cetinje only with the help of the Brƒëani, who were in feud with the Montenegrin tribes. In 1688, the Kuƒçi, with help from Klimenti and Piperi, destroyed the army of Sulejman-pa≈°a twice, took over Medun and got their hands of large quantities of weapons and equipment. In 1689, an uprising broke out in Piperi, Rovca, Bjelopavliƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Kuƒçi and Vasojeviƒái, while at the same time an uprising broke out in Prizren, Peƒá, Pri≈°tina and Skopje, and then in Kratovo and Kriva Palanka in October (Karposh's Rebellion). S√ºleyman entered Cetinje again in 1692, again with the help of the Brƒëani, and pushed out the Venetians, reasserting his rule over Montenegro which had been under Venetian protection. At that time, the Brƒëani had little respect of their co-religious tribal neighbours, as plunder was their main income. Plav, Gusinje, and the Orthodox population in those regions suffered the most from the Klimenti's attacks. In 1774, in the same month of the death of ≈†ƒáepan Mali, Mehmed Pasha Bushati attacked the Kuƒçi and Bjelopavliƒái, but was decisively defeated and returned to Scutari. Documents, especially the letter of Ivan Radonjiƒá from 1789, show that the Montenegrins were identified as Serbs, and that the Banjani, Kuƒçi, Piperi, Bjelopavliƒái, Zeƒáani, Vasojeviƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái were not identified as \\"Montenegrins\\". They were all mentioned only in a regional, geographical, and tribal manner, and never as an ethnic category.Vukƒçeviƒá 1981, p. 46 In 1794, the Kuƒçi and Rovƒçani were devastated by the Ottomans.Barjaktaroviƒá 1984, p. 28 In 1796, the Montenegrin army under Metropolitan Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈° with the assistance of Piperi defeated the Ottoman army at the Battle of Krusi. The Montenegrin victory resulted in territorial expansion, with the tribes of Bjelopavliƒái and Piperi being joined into the Montenegrin state. The Rovƒçani, as other highlander tribes, subsequently turned more and more towards the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro.Barjaktaroviƒá 1984, p. 29 Metropolitan Petar I sent letters in 1799 to the Moraƒçani and Rovƒçani, advising them to live peacefully and in solidarity. During the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì13), the Drobnjaci, Moraƒçani, Rovƒçani, Uskoci and Pivljani rose against the Ottomans and burnt down villages in Herzegovina. The Rovca and Lower and Upper Moraƒça tribes were incorporated into Montenegro only in 1820, after the defeat of the Ottoman army at the Moraƒça river, and Vasojeviƒái even later, in 1858. Prince- Bishop Petar I (r. 1782-1830) waged a successful campaign against the bey of Bosnia in 1819; the repulse of an Ottoman invasion from Albania during the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29) led to the recognition of Montenegrin sovereignty over Piperi.Miller, p. 142 Petar I had managed to unite the Piperi and Bjelopavliƒái with Montenegro, and when Bjelopavliƒái and the rest of the Hills (Seven hills) were joined into Peter's state, a polity officially called \\"Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". A civil war broke out in 1847, in which the Piperi, Kuƒçi, Bjelopavliƒái and Crmnica sought to confront the growing centralized power of new prince of Montenegro; the secessionists were subdued and their ringleaders shot.Miller, p. 144 Amid the Crimean War, there was a political problem in Montenegro; Danilo I's uncle, George, urged for yet another war against the Ottomans, but the Austrians advised Danilo not to take arms.Miller, p. 218 A conspiracy was formed against Danilo, led by his uncles George and Pero, the situation came to its height when the Ottomans stationed troops along the Herzegovinian frontier, provoking the mountaineers. Some urged an attack on Bar, others raided into Herzegovina, and the discontent of Danilo's subjects grew so much that the Piperi, Kuƒçi and Bjelopavliƒái, the recent and still unamalgamated acquisitions, proclaimed themselves an independent state in July, 1854. In Danilo I's Code, dated to 1855, he explicitly states that he is the \\"knjaz (duke, prince) and gospodar (lord) of the Free Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". Danilo was forced to take measurement against the rebels in Brda, some rebels crossed into Ottoman territory and some submitted and were to pay for the civil war they had caused. Knjaz Danilo was assassinated in August, 1860 as he was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor. The assassin, Chief Todor Kadiƒá of the Bjelopavliƒái, was said to be assisted by Austrian authorities in carrying out the assassination. Some speculate that there was a personal feud between the two, the fact that Danilo had an affair with Todor's wife and the ongoing mistreatment of the Bjelopavliƒái tribe by Danilo's guards and his forces. When Bjelopavliƒái and the rest of the Hills (Seven hills) was joined into the state during the rule of Peter I, it was officially called \\"Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". In Danilo I's Code, dated to 1855, he explicitly states that he is the \\"knjaz (duke, prince) and gospodar (lord) of the Free Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\".

Construction began in 2013 at the site of the former flagship store for Filene's in Downtown Crossing and was completed in 2016. , it is the fourth tallest building in Boston. The building contains 442 condominiums, a Roche Bros. grocery store and Class A office space. Limited occupancy by residents began in July 2016. History =Initial plans, demolition, and project halt= Millennium Tower and the Burnham Building occupy the space of the former flagship Filene's store. When Filene's closed, the building was put up for sale and was bought by Vornado Realty Trust of New York. Vornado teamed up with Gale International for a $700 million redevelopment of the Filene's site. As approved in August 2007, the site redevelopment project consisted of a 39-story tower including a 280-room hotel, a 125-seat restaurant, of office space, 166 residential condos, of retail space, and an adjacent park. It was originally scheduled for completion by 2011. In order to gut the historic Filene's building and demolish an adjacent building, the project required closing Filene's Basement and the loss of 218 retail jobs. In Summer of 2008, the developers halted the project, citing the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08. As of the halt, demolition was nearly complete, leaving the Burnham building gutted and a large excavation where the non-landmarked parts of the former Filenes complex (built in the 1950s‚Äì1970s) had stood. The side of the Burnham building that was exposed by the nearby demolition was temporarily covered with a tarp. After two years of inactivity, the City of Boston revoked the developer's permits in November of 2010. =Ownership change and construction start= In 2012, Millennium Partners took over the task and won approval for a 625-foot tower with 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m2) of commercial and residential space in two buildings. On April 13, 2013, major tenant Arnold Worldwide was signed to occupy a large part of the new building. With the agreement in place, construction resumed. The building officially broke ground on September 17, 2013 with mayor Thomas M. Menino in attendance. On April 26, 2014, 600 trucks poured of concrete into a slab for the new building, making it the largest pour in the city's history. =Recent developments and tenants= Tenants as of 2013 already planned for the building included Roche Bros supermarket. According to an August 2016 article in the Boston Globe, luxury condos have been purchased by local residents as well buyers from Asia and Europe. A Millennium executive estimated at the time that 75% of the owners will be living in their units in Downtown Crossing.

Early years Jean-Pierre-Paul Sauzet was born on 23 March 1800 in Lyon. His father was chief doctor at the hospice de la Charit√© in Lyon. Sauzet received a bachelor's degree at the age of fifteen with a dispensation for his age. He was sent to the school of law in Paris, where he was distinguished for his speaking ability. After completing his studies he joined the bar in Lyon. Sauzet pleaded in trials that ranged from major criminal cases to complex questions of commerce or administration. He was noted for his clarity of expression, lively speech and extraordinary ability to improvise. His reputation spread quickly and Jean Joseph Antoine de Courvoisier, formerly Attorney General in Lyon and now Minister of Justice, offered him a position at the Royal Court of Paris, which he refused. July Monarchy Sauzet did not participate in the July Revolution of 1830, but welcomed the new government. Jean de Chantelauze, former keeper of the seals of King Charles X of France, chose Sauzet to defend him at the Court of Paris. Sauzet argued with great eloquence that the ministers had done their duty to the king, but after his fall had no further responsibility. His performance made his reputation. He was offered public office but preferred to remain an advocate. In 1833 Sauzet undertook the defense of General Saint-Priest, implicated in the affair of Carlo Alberto, and obtained his acquittal. On 21 June 1834 Sauzet was elected Deputy for two districts of Rhone, Lyon and Villefranche, and chose to represent Lyon. He was liberal and independent, and sat on the center left.

The building is referred to as the Taj Mahal, or simply the Taj. It is Building 100 on the base, and was erected in 1931 at a cost of $252,027.50. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Design and construction Basic design and layout of Randolph Field (renamed Randolph Air Force Base in 1948), as the training facility to be built near Schertz, Texas, for the newly created Air Corps, was drafted by 1st Lt. Harold L. Clark of Kelly Field in 1928 and approved by Brigadier General Frank Purdy Lahm. Clark's draft for the central building combined all administrative functions under one roof, including the water tower with a rotating beacon on the top. He later donated his drawings to the Library of Congress. Atlee B. Ayres and his son Robert M. Ayres were hired to draft the construction plans. The $252,027.50 facility designated as Building 100 was completed on July 15, 1931, and opened on October 5, 1931. Its iconic design is one of the great early Art Deco efforts in the United States. Features Building 100 has been headquarters for the 12th Flying Training Wing since 1972. The two-story facility, with one-story wings on both sides, was designed with space for 22 offices on the ground floor, nine offices in the basement, and 18 offices on the second story. Floors and stairways were constructed of granite terrazzo. The base printing and photography needs were handled out of the building, and it also served as the mail processing center. Courtroom facilities were incorporated into the original design, and legal proceedings continue to be part of the building's usage. The 902nd Mission Support Group Office of the Staff Judge Advocate operates on the first floor of the Taj. The building was nicknamed the Taj Mahal in its early years, due to what some thought was an architectural similarity to the Taj Mahal in India, and is commonly referred to as \\"the Taj\\". It has been featured in movies such as West Point of the Air, Air Cadet and I Wanted Wings. A detailed replica of the Taj has sometimes been shown at military conventions. Carved from a block of wood in 1984 by base military retirees, the replica has a working electrical light beacon. =Water tank tower= The facility encompasses its most notable feature, a enclosed water tank. Clark's concept of incorporating the water tank into the building's architecture was aesthetically pleasing, but also was designed to eliminate its possibility of being the aviation hazard it might have been were it a stand-alone structure. Radio antennas and a climate detector on the dome supported the communications office headquartered in the building. The base water system is contained within the tank which rests on an independent foundation inside the central octagon tower. The removable concrete walls of the tower are designed for tank maintenance. Topping the tower is a light beacon resting on a dome with a mosaic chevron design of blue and gold. An interior elevator leads to an observation deck at the bottom of the dome. Beneath the water tank is the Clark Rotunda, which features four murals painted by William Dean Fausett in 1942‚Äì1944 to represent the training cadets of that era. =Theater and memorial monument= The base theater is located in the rear of the building and was designed to seat 1,200 people. It hosted the world premiere of I Wanted Wings, which had been filmed at Randolph. Its original design had an orchestra pit below the stage. In 2012, the theater was operating at a loss and stopped showing 35 mm film. At that time it underwent a renovation as a 772-seat auditorium, and in 2013 was renamed in honor of Brigadier General Kenneth Raymond Fleenor who had been held captive and tortured for over 5 years in North Vietnam. After his repatriation, he spent the remaining years of his military service at Randolph as Base Commander and in other positions of authority. On March 4, 1977, the Missing Man Monument by sculptor Mark Pritchett was installed in front of Building 100 by the San Antonio chapter of the Red River Valley Fighter Pilots to commemorate combat fatalities in Southeast Asia. Both the monument and the theater are part of events related to veterans, combat fatalities, prisoners of war and those missing in action.

Description and history The Brackett House is located in a rural area of eastern Dublin, occupying a spot at the top of a north-south ridge that affords fine views of Mount Monadnock to the west and the hills of Peterborough to the east. It is located on the west side of High Ridge Road, a private lane providing access to the ridge. It is a wood frame structure, presenting 1¬Ω stories to the road, and 2¬Ω to the west because of the steeply sloping terrain. Its form is that of an L-shaped Colonial Revival house, but it is covered by a roof that is hipped on the main block and gabled on the ell, that extends further than normal for the form. The eaves are supported by large decoratively cut brackets, giving the building the flavor of an alpine chateau. A side porch has balustrades with a square pattern suggestive of Japanese design influence. The architecturally eclectic house was built in 1915 as the summer residence of Jeffrey Richardson Brackett and Susan K. Brackett. Jeffrey Brackett was a sociologist who taught at Johns Hopkins University and at Simmons College. Susan Brackett left the nearby MacDowell Colony a major endowment in 1931. The family also owned the Ivory Perry Homestead, located in the valley to the west, and occupied both properties until about 1959.

It is commonly served with carbohydrates, such as noodles or congee. Background Pig blood curd originated from blood rice pudding () in southern China. Blood rice pudding is a pastry made from blood and rice grains. Rice is the main ingredient of southern Chinese cuisine; the two common methods to cook rice are steaming and boiling. Duck meat is a source of supplement (), however, because of the poor living conditions in the past, poultry was only offered as sacrifices in Chinese festivals. In order to get nutrition from the ducks, farmers saved the blood, steamed it with rice, and served it with sauce. Later, blood rice pudding spread to neighboring towns and villages, and people named it duck blood pudding (). However, because of the rising price of duck, and the inability of chicken blood to coagulate into pudding, pig blood replaced duck blood, resulting in the birth of pig blood curd.Wilson J.

Retrieved (23.03.2014) Preparation thumb Pig blood curd is solid pig blood. Manufacturers coagulate fresh blood by letting it sit in a clean container for around 10 minutes. The blood cube is cut into smaller pieces, then heated in a pot with medium heat with water. During the heating process, salt is added to solidify the blood cubes, and the pot is occasionally stirred to prevent the water from boiling. After 30 minutes, pig blood curd is ready to be served.

In 2015, Bangladesh was ranked 139 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index and 47 out 144 countries surveyed on the Gender Inequality Index in 2017. Many of the inequalities are result of extreme poverty and traditional gender norms centred on a patrilineal and patriarchal kinship system in rural areas. Gender norms Inhabitants of Rangabali Bangladesh is one of six countries of the world where the number of men exceeds the number of women. Eighty-eight percent of the population adheres to Islam. Veiling remains a domain of contestation in regards to whether it serves as a vehicle of empowerment or discrimination. While seen in Western discourse as restrictive of women's rights, some claim that burkas allow for better freedom of movement in Bangladesh. Despite the changes that have come with the demand for women in the export industry, women are generally unseen outside the domestic sphere. This is especially true in rural Bangladesh. While labour force increase has accounted for higher percentages for females than males, terms of equality are measured in various areas beyond employment. Their status and position is also measured in terms of education, income, assets, health, and the role they play in the family and in society. These characteristics are representative of the amount of political power and social prestige a woman is accorded and thus the extent to which she can influence decision-making within the home and in the community.United Nations, CEDAW combined 3rd and 4th periodic reports, 1997 Legal status Although the Constitution of Bangladesh states that women have equal footing with men in all spheres of public life, it also recognises religious personal laws, which are unequal to women. Four significant events in the life of a woman: marriage; divorce; custody of children; and, inheritance rights are governed by personal laws. Personal laws are based on religious and social value systems. Because women are the primary caregivers for children, in cases of divorce, custody is most often awarded to the mother. In recent years, several laws have been put in place to reduce the amount of violence against women and girls. Early in 2011, a Division Bench of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court ordered every incident of eve- teasing to be considered sexual harassment. It also ordered an amendment to the Prevention and of Repression on Women and Children Act of 2000 to include the act of stalking in its provisions. Other laws protecting Bangladeshi women include the Acid Crime Control 2002 and the Dowry Prohibition Act 1980. However, weak enforcement of these laws is common due to a weak judiciary, corruption, and societal tolerance. =The Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)= In 1979, the United Nations General Assembly adopted CEDAW as an international bill of rights for women. It defines what constitutes discrimination against women and creates an agenda for states to end discrimination worldwide. States that ratify CEDAW are legally bound to put its provisions into practice and are obligated to submit national status reports every 4 yearsUnited Nations, \\"Short History of CEDAW Convention\\", UN Women On 6 November 1984, Bangladesh ratified CEDAW with reservations on Articles 2, 13.1[a], 16.1[c], and [f] due to conflicts with Sharia law of Islam.Asian Women's Resource Exchange, \\"CEDAW and Women: The Bangladesh experience\\", WPRN Newsletter, June 1998Partners for Law and Development, \\"Bangladesh Ratification Status\\", CEDAW South Asia, 2014 Since ratification, Bangladesh has undergone milestone changes in gender equality. In 2009, a public interest litigation case brought by the Bangladesh National Women's Lawyers Association challenged the High Court to step in and take action as there was no national law against sexual harassment. CEDAW became the centre of the Court's deliberations, and particular interest in CEDAW's Article 11 on equality in employment and the CEDAW Committee's General Recommendation no. 19 on violence against women was given. Based on these principles, the Court issued sexual harassment guidelines for the whole country, which will remain when legislation is passed.United Nations, \\"CEDAW Success Stories\\", 30 Years United Nations CEDAW, 2009 Bangladesh has also used CEDAW to help attain gender parity in primary school enrolment and has as a goal for 2015, to eliminate all gender disparities in secondary education.CEDAW 2014, \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\", United Nations, 2009 Health In 2011, 24% of births were attended by a professional health physician. Sex selective health care and infanticide suggest a correlation between the number of females to males in Bangladesh. In Europe where men and women are given similar health care and nutrition, women outnumber men 105:100. In Bangladesh, that ratio is 95:100. In terms of the population, that ratio accounts for approximately 5 million missing women.Westhof, Dirk. \\"A perspective of gender inequality in Bangladesh. Analysis, UNICEF, 201 Economist Amartya Sen argues that this low ratio is primarily due to insufficient health care provided for young girls but nowadays NGOs are encouraging equal health care. Pdf version. He reported that men, followed by boys, is the largest group of people admitted into hospitals. Women family members are less likely to receive modern medical care and are generally recipients of traditional remedies. The health situation for urban women is worse than that for rural women, especially those living in slums. The urban population living in the slum areas do not have adequate sanitation, water and health facilities which results in poor health. Education In 2011, the population with at least a secondary education was 30.8% for women and 39.3% for men. Due to poverty, literacy rates have remained low. In the span of 30 years (1970 to 2000), the female-male literacy ratio has more than doubled, from 0.30 to 0.61. While levels remain low, there is a more rapid increase of educational attainment for women than men. Girls enrolments are rising. However, due to financial constraints and the lack of earning opportunities for educated women, the rationale in the Bangladesh family to educate a boy over a girl still persists. Other impediments to educational attainment for women include early marriage, cultural norms, and religious orthodoxy. Participation in technical disciplines (regarded as men's domain) in areas such as engineering and agriculture is unequal as well. The student population at technical universities is only 9% female. Employment Labor force participation for females has been driven primarily by the growth of approved export industry jobs in textiles and the spread of micro financing operations by NGOs including the Grameen Bank. Women's participation in high skill, managerial, and government executive positions have increased only to a limited extent. Income inequalities between women and men are still existent in Bangladesh. The 2012 Human Development Report shows that in the small business sector, for every dollar earned by a male, women make 12 cents in comparison.Revenga, Ana; Shettythe, Sudir, The World Bank, Human Development Report, 2012 However, overtime gender earning gaps have decreased in favour of women. =Microcredit= Since the 1970s, microcredit institutions in Bangladesh have moved to the centre stage of most poverty alleviation schemes. The most notable micro finance institutions in Bangladesh are the Grameen Bank and BRAC. (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) In 2005, these two institutions covered 59% of total microcredit borrowers in Bangladesh.Zaham, H. (2005) 'The Economics and Governance of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in Bangladesh', Consultation Draft, Washington, DC: World Bank Marketization of the originally intended welfare oriented sector have made micro finance widely popular, accounting for a $2.1 billion industry. These loans require no collateral, making for attractive prospects to poor and/or rural Bangladeshi families who have no collateral to offer. Bangladeshi women are primarily who these institutions target. This relies upon observations that patriarchy is deeply embedded in the culture, thus the spotlight is on empowering women who are vulnerable and powerless. Research also suggests that loans given to women tend to more often benefit the whole family than do loans to men. Having been adopted in one of the U.N.'s Millennium Development Goals, micro credit initiatives have been seen as beneficial for alleviating poverty. While it has been shown to do this, scholars also indicate that in many cases, micro credit loans can worsen poverty. As observed in the context of India's microcredit crisis of 2010, client poaching occurs where the poorest of individuals are given loans, even if they have little to no prospects of repayment. Quick repayment requirements on loans often don't give women enough time to generate the income quickly enough through their business expenditures. Financial setbacks in the initial stages of business, use of loan money for emergencies and/or day-to-day consumption can result in large indebtedness and conditions of poverty worse than before. Thus, collateral takes the form as scholar Lamia Karim coins, the economy of shame. In Bangladesh, women are the traditional custodians of honour. Deferral on these loans puts the honour of the family and the security of the woman at risk, thus making shame and humiliation collateral for micro credit institutions. Another disadvantage to women in micro finance is credit control. While intended for women, husbands in the family often end up being the sole beneficiaries of the capital. The idea that \\"since my wife belongs to me, than so does the money\\" is largely the reason for this. Garment workers in Bangladesh =Garment industry= The garment sector in Bangladesh accounts for 77% of total exports, as well as being the country's largest industry.\\"Textiles on the WTO website\\", WTO Secretariat, from the original on 3 November 2008, Retrieved 10 April 2014 Low wages and poor commitment to Bangladesh's labour laws have provided the basis for extremely competitive labour costs. Unmarried women from rural areas are the preferred garment factory workers, and correspondingly make up the majority of the labour force. Women are preferred over men primarily because its deemed a) women are more patient and nimble b) women are more controllable than men c) women are less mobile and less likely to join a trade union d) women can do better in sewing because it coincides with domestic jobs.Paul-Majumder, Pratima; Anwara, Begum; The Gender Imbalances in the Export Oriented Garment Industry in Bangladesh; Policy Research Report on Gender development, Working Paper Series, No. 12, The World Bank, June 200 Garment workers experience several violations of worker rights which are supposedly protected in Bangladesh's labour codes. Among these violations are long working hours, illegal pay deductions, lack of safe and sanitary working conditions and denial of freedom to associate and bargain collectively. Harassment and abuse against workers is also extremely prevalent in Bangladesh. Working conditions are different for women than men because they work different jobs. Generally, women suffer the worst working conditions because they hold low skill jobs where occupational hazards are greater. Health is adversely affected by long working hours and poor ventilation. Garment workers also often suffer from the absence of a lunchroom and clean drinking water. Safety and fire hazards are issues as well; in April 2013, a factory collapse on the outskirts of Dhaka killed 1,021 people. Female workers deal with other issues male workers don't need to. Female garment workers can face an uncongenial work environment, unsafe transportation, and housing. These factors generally don't affect male workers. Sexual harassment and violence in the workplace are also common. In 1998, 161 rape cases in and around garment factories were reported by the Department of Metropolitan Police in Dhaka. Despite these negative aspects, the garment industry to many Bangladeshi women represents one of few options to work with dignity. The industry allows for women, in many cases, to become the bread winners for their families as well as having elevation in social status. In the International People's Health Assembly held in Bangladesh in 2000, voices of women spoke out against the threat of imposing international labour standards threatening their garment industry jobs. Political participation Sheikh Hasina, current prime minister of Bangladesh. Since the 1990s, women have become increasingly influential in the political arena. Despite the barriers that come with patriarchal rules and the purdah, the system of quotas has ensured women's representation in the national parliament and local governments. Since 1991, all the prime minister elections have been won by two female prime ministers, Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. Elections in December 2008 resulted in the election of Hasina, who is currently serving. Despite these successes, there remain several factors that limit women's political participation. The political culture based on vengeance, distrust and corruption has ideological, political, religious and institutional dimensions that are rooted in the whole of society. The result is an institutionalisation of violence as a means of political expression. In 2007, 192 cases of women being attacked with acid were registered. Intimidation by conservative parties and religious and socio-cultural norms are used to cut down and intimidate women, limiting their rights to vote. High rates of illiteracy have also acted as limiting factors.Labani, Sepideh; Zabaleta Kaehler, Carla; De Dios Ruiz, Paula; Regional Gender Programme in South-East Asia-Stage II, \\"Gender analysis of women's political participation in 7 South- East Asian countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, East Timor, and Vietnam, 2008‚Äì2009 Inequality and violence against women Cultural and traditional factors heavily influence how women are treated and regarded in Bangladesh. Once married, women, adolescents, and girls become property of the husbands family. This limits opportunities for schooling, thus perpetuating dependence and disempowerment. Domestic violence and discrimination are difficult to measure, acts of violence can be accounted for in court proceedings and police reports. Violence in Bangladesh ranges from acid throwing, physical and psychological torture, sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, related violence, trafficking, forced prostitution, coerced suicide and murder. =Rape= Rape is one of the most brutal forms of violence against women in Bangladesh, and its on the rise. Data from the BNWLA Resource centre shows that rape cases doubled from 564 in 2001 to 1043 in 2004. Gang rape has become increasingly prevalent as well. =Domestic violence= Domestic violence incidents in Bangladesh are widespread and fairly common, affecting women across all forms of economic strata. While largely under-reported due to social stigma and fear, data suggests an increase in reported cases of abuse. In 2001, 530 domestic abuse cases were reported in Bangladeshi newspapers. In 2004, the number of cases reported more than doubled that number at 1164 cases. Despite this, domestic violence is not seen as a serious crime. Because it is often regarded as family matters, law enforcement agencies may be reluctant to get involved. =Acid violence= Acid violence against women has become popular act of revenge since the 1980s. Bangladesh has the highest worldwide incidents of acid crimes, accounting for 9% of burn injuries in the country. A recent study reveals that land disputes account for 27% of acid attacks, followed by 18% for family disputes, 10% for refusal of sex, 8% for refusal of romantic relationship, 5% for dowry conflicts, 4% for marital disputes, 3% for refusal of marriage proposal, 2% for political enmity, and the remaining 23% for unknown reasons. Despite new harsh laws, acid violence has been increasing over the last few years.Farouk, Sharmeen A., Violence against women : A statistical overview, challenges and gaps in data collection and methodology and approaches for overcoming them, Division for the Advancement of Women, United Nations, 14 April 2005 Statistics do not fully capture the devastating effects of acid violence. The plight for victims goes beyond physical scarring, daily life is forever marked by stigma, harassment, and destitution.

The nearest college to the village is Patitapabana Mahavidyalaya in Jarapada, although pupils from the village also commute to Government Autonomous College, Angul and Janata College, Boinda for higher studies.  Culture  There is a famous saying among the Odias, that \\"Odias have 13 festivals in 12 months\\". This is typical of most of the villages in Odisha and Ogi is no exception to this. Major festivals in the village include Dusshera, Kartik Poornima, Shivaratri. However Ogi is most famous in the Angul district for its annual Dola Purnima/Phalguna Yatra or Agara Jatra as popularly known. Other Odia religious festivals like Pana Sankranti, Hanuman Jayanti, Akshaya Tritiya, Raja Parba, Raksha Bandhan, Khudurukuni Osha, Ganesha Puja/Vinayaka Chaturthi, Garvana Sankranti, Kumara Purnima, Deepavali, Prathamastami, Manabasa/Mahalaxmi Gurubara, Pausa Purnima, Makara Sankranti, Saraswati Puja and Holi are observed ordinarily and serially according to the Odia Calendar that follows the regular Hindu calendar.

Economy  Agriculture is the main livelihood of the village populace and the major population living in the village belongs to CHASA community, whose traditional occupation is farming. However marginal land holding and lack of proper irrigation facilities with heavy dependency on rain water for farming often causes great hardship for the farmers. There are other occupational groups such as black smith, oil producers, gold smith, traders, and priestly class living together in the village as a single unit. In recent years, due to industrialization of Odisha, a large number of youths are leaving farming occupation and getting engaged in other industrial activities.

The ditch supplied water from the East Fork of the Illinois River to the High Gravel and Cameron mines, two hydraulic mines that conducted placer gold mining operations in the Upper Illinois Valley. The ditch was dug around 1900, at the same time that the High Gravel Mine was built. It took its name from F.H. Osgood, who purchased the mine shortly after its construction and expanded the ditch. When the Cameron Mine began hydraulic operations in the 1910s, the ditch brought water to that mine as well. The ditch was last used in 1942, after which point both mines had shut down. . The ditch was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 2001.

It premiered on Adult Swim on January 27, 2014, was written by Justin Roiland, and directed by Stephen Sandoval. In the episode, a love potion goes wrong, creating a virus that begins to infect the entire world population, making everyone fall in love with Morty. The episode received critical acclaim, receiving praise for its story, subplot, and ending. It was seen by 1.7 million viewers at first airing. The title of the episode is in reference to the 1959 song \\"Love Potion No. 9\\" by the Clovers. Plot Morty has a long-term crush on Jessica, a redhead teenage girl at his school. On the night of the Flu Season Dance at his school, his desire leads him to ask Rick for a love serum, and Rick acquiesces, giving him a serum derived from voles. Upon Morty giving Jessica (who, unbeknownst to Morty, has the flu) the serum, it latches onto the flu virus and goes airborne, spreading through the entire planet in a matter of minutes and causing every person not directly related to Morty to fall in love with him. In an attempt to counteract the DNA used in the original serum, Rick makes an antidote from mantis DNA, but the serum fails, instead causing the world's population to mutate into monstrous mantis-people, all of whom want to eat Morty after mating with him. As these events transpire, Jerry, feeling insecure about his relationship with Beth, follows her to work after she is called in for a late shift. En route, Jerry finds the road blocked by the chaos created by the mantis-people; when they attempt to force Morty's whereabouts out of him, he escapes and kills them with a shotgun. Arriving at the equine hospital at which Beth works, he finds Beth cornered by her raving, infected co-worker; after Jerry kills him with a crowbar, the two reconcile their marriage. Hiding from the infected population in the desert, Rick makes a third serum to undo all the previous ones. But as the serum was amalgamated from various DNA sources, it only further mutates the world's population into barely humanoid blobs. Dubbing the monstrosities \\"Cronenbergs\\" (a reference to famous director of body horror films David Cronenberg), Rick decides the situation is beyond repair. Rather than attempt to fix the world, he scans the multiverse to find another dimension in which alternate versions of himself and Morty managed to find a solution and avert the mutation pandemic, but perished soon after. Rick and Morty enter the new reality, bury their alternate selves in the backyard and quietly assume their place. The episode ends with Morty visibly traumatized by the transpired events and his counterpart's gruesome death, set to the song \\"Look on Down from the Bridge\\" by Mazzy Star. In a post-credits scene, Jerry, Beth, and Summer are the sole unmutated humans left in the ruined Cronenberg-infested world. Meanwhile, Cronenberg versions of Rick and Morty appear from a dimension where Cronenberg Rick accidentally turned the whole world into normal people. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode of B+, reserving particularly strong praise for what they saw as a \\"deconstruction of the creepiness of the love potion trope\\". Joe Matar of the website Den of Geek liked the episode, saying that while it wasn't as funny as the previous episode, it had a wonderfully dark ending, and that he enjoyed Jerry's action hero subplot. David Roa of Dead Screen loved the ending, saying that \\"while it was very Deus ex machina, it was still satisfying.\\" He compared it to how people treat the planet, and just move to a new location after destroying where they live. An author for the website Junkie Monkeys said that the episode was his second favorite up until that point, behind only ‚ÄúAnatomy Park‚Äù. Noel Davila from the website Geeks Under Grace rated the episode 8.6 out of 9.0, saying the episode is \\"one of the greatest and arguably most impactful episodes to the entire series mythology\\". He appreciated the relationship dynamics in this episode and said that it did a great job in combining high-concept scientific theory with their extremely dark humour. Justin Roiland has called this his favorite episode of the first half of the first season, both because he thought it was paced well, and due to the fact that he loved how insane it got in the end.

Overview In November 2012, it was announced that Bret McKenzie would be returning to write songs for Muppets Most Wanted following the success of its 2011 predecessor, The Muppets. As opposed to the previous film, McKenzie wrote all of the original songs for Muppets Most Wanted; his songwriting influences for the film include the Sherman Brothers, Irving Berlin, Paul Williams, and Harry Nilsson. With song ideas originating from short descriptions in the film's screenplay, McKenzie developed numerous songs and performed demo versions of each by doing impressions of various Muppets. \\"I'm usually just on piano, with me singing and doing my now quite extensive catalog of Muppet impressions,\\" said McKenzie. \\"I play a rough version then we get together and work out the best. James [Bobin] often has an idea that's visual that he needs to change the lyric to suit the visual and then we record it with the Muppets.\\" A music video of McKenzie performing \\"I'll Get You What You Want (Cockatoo in Malibu)\\" was released on March 19, 2014 on Funny or Die.

Callinan is a two-time graduate of the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, qualifying in law enforcement management (1995) and the \\"National Executive Institute\\" programme (2010) for international Chiefs of Police. He holds a BA (Hons) Degree in Police Management. Early life Callinan was born in Dublin in 1953. His father was from Galway and owned a shop in Drumcondra. Career Callinan became a member of An Garda S√≠och√°na in 1973 and was promoted to the position of sergeant in 1986. Callinan quickly rose through the ranks of the organisation; he mainly served in Dublin, but he also spent had spells stationed in Waterford and Mayo. As member of the Central Detective Unit, Callinan began to be assigned to high profile cases and began to become a prominent official within the force. He also took part in the Garda Crime and Security Branch and the Special Detective Unit. In the early 1990s, he was appointed as head of the \\"Tango Squad\\", a group of Gardai who spent the large majority of their on- duty time monitoring the activities of Martin Cahill, a notorious Irish mob boss. The Tango Squad proved to be successful in thwarting many of Cahill's activities and preventing him from taking on any major criminal objectives; this helped boost Callinan's career significantly. By the time of Cahill's assassination by the Provisional IRA in 1994, Callinan was a detective inspector. Investigations into the Omagh bombing, and its perpetrators, the Real IRA, were led by Callinan. He also took part in Garda reviews of the Ryan Report and the Murphy Report. In 2001, Callinan was promoted to chief superintendent and was later appointed as Assistant Commissioner of the National Support Services in 2005. The NSS has under its jurisdiction the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Garda National Drugs Unit, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. Callinan was further promoted in January 2007, by his friend and Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, to the position of Deputy Commissioner. Callinan was assigned to manage Strategy and Change Manangement but was soon reassigned to Operations; as part of this appointment, he was assigned with managing all policing within the Republic of Ireland and any national security issues. Fachtna Murphy resigned as Garda Commissioner in late 2010; Martin Callinan, who by this time was an extremely well versed guard and had taken part in almost all areas of the force, was one of the top choices for the job. He was successful and appointed to the position on the 28 December 2010. Callinan's tenure as Garda Commissioner was rough, with multiple scandals uncovering during his time at the helm of the force. Over 100 Garda stations were closed during Callinan's 4 year leadership, for which he received harsh criticism for. Reports from the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission, also known as GSOC, criticized the handling of Kieran Boylan, an informant to the Gardai about various drug trafficking cartels in Ireland. The Smithwick Tribunal also revealed serious concerns about the collusion of Gardai into murdering two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers in 1989. His time as Commissioner was further damaged by revelations of botched investigation procedures in regards to the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier in 1996. Callinan has also been scrutinized by journalist Gemma O'Doherty, who had pursued Callinan over allegations of penalty point cancellations, specifically in regards to Callinans own license. A number of weeks later, her employer, Independent News & Media, made O'Doherty redundant. In November 2018, the government began a review into the legal costs of Callinan. The Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, stated that the government had been in correspondence with the Attorney General in reviewing Callinan's legal costs which the state had covered prior to the Disclosures Tribunal. The Charleton Tribunal prompted the government to begin discussions about reviewing the money spent and advice was sought from the Attorney General on the legality of the matter. The government before this had received prompts from opposition TD's, such as Mary Lou McDonald. Views on whistleblowing Callinan's views on whistleblowing became publicly known when two members of the force brought to the attention of members of Oireachtas that senior Garda√≠ had inappropriately wiped penalty points from driving licences. The whistleblowers, Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, made their allegations to the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee. When Martin Callinan appeared before the Public Accounts Committee he described the actions of the men as \\"disgusting\\". Following these comments a report by the Independent Garda Inspectorate described a consistent and widespread pattern of breaches of policy by those administering the system. In March 2014, Martin Callinan announced his retirement, earlier than had been expected. Around the same time the early retirement of Chief Superintendent Kevin Donohoe, head of Special Branch (SDU), was also made known.Martin Callinan: my shock that Enda Kenny shafted me, Irish Independent, 30 March 2014 Weeks later, Minister for Justice Alan Shatter announced his resignation. Callinan's resignation coincided with the outbreak of two other scandals; allegations that the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) was under surveillance by an unknown group which had used \\"government-level technology\\" following a counter-surveillance operation undertaken by a British private security firm, and the emergence that phone calls in Garda stations throughout the country had been recorded on a mass scale for over 30 years before the practice was brought to an end. The government in April 2014 established a commission of investigation into Callinan's resignation and these other issues. It is commonly called the Fennelly Commission after its sole member, Nial Fennelly, a retired justice of the Supreme Court. In September 2015, the commission issued an interim report relating to Callinan's retirement. Deputy Commissioner N√≥ir√≠n O'Sullivan replaced Callinan as the Garda Commissioner. Callinan was finally found by Mr Justice Charlton to have conducted a campaign of ‚Äúcalumny‚Äù against Maurice McCabe and was publicly disgraced as a consequence, McCabe was vindicated as an exemplary police officer.

It's among the more competitive film incentive programs in the country.‚Äù So, In January 2014 the production was scheduled to begin in late March in Massachusetts. The shooting of the film began on March 23, 2014 in Princeton, Massachusetts. Filming also reportedly took place at New England Studios in Devens. Release The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 18, 2015. It was released on February 5, 2016, by Starz Digital. Reception Tumbledown received generally positive reviews.

Shaker settlement The Union Village Shaker settlement was a community of Shakers founded at Turtle Creek, Ohio, in 1805. Early leaders sent out from the Shakers' central Ministry at New Lebanon, New York, included Elder David Darrow (1750-1825), who began evangelizing in 1805, and Eldress Ruth Farrington (1763-1821), who arrived in 1806 to help stabilize the new Shaker society. An early and influential proselyte was Richard McNemar (1770-1839), who was a central figure among western Shakers for many years.Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers.

The sisters who signed the covenant were Ruth Farrington, Molly Goodrich, Ruth Darrow, Lucy Bacon, Rachel Johnson, Hortency Goodrich, Martha Sanford, Edith Dennis, Eunice Bedle, Caty Rubert, Susanna Liddil, Polly Thomas, Jenny McNemar, Polly Davis, Hannah Carson, Rachel Duncan, Rachel Dennis, and Phebe Lockwood.John P. MacLean, Bibliography of Shaker Literature (1905), p.16. Ohio Bishopric Ministry Until 1910, Union Village was the bishopric, or governing unit, for other Shaker villages in Ohio, including the Whitewater Shaker Settlement and the Watervliet Shaker village. After 1862, the Shaker settlement at North Union also came under Union Village's administration. After 1889, the Union Village bishopric ministry oversaw all societies in Kentucky and Ohio.Paterwic p. 18Whitewater Shaker Settlement. Shaker Historic Trail. National Park Service. Retrieved March 25, 2014. Shakers were led by gender-balanced teams of elders and eldresses. These individuals were suggested by local consensus and their selection was approved by the Shakers' central Ministry in New Lebanon, New York. Every bishopric's ministry was supposed to oversee the Shaker societies under their jurisdiction and keep an eye on the leaders of all the families, but this system did not always work as intended (see Joseph Slingerland, below). From 1812 to 1821, David Darrow and his assistant Solomon King were the Ohio bishopric elders, serving with Ruth Farrington and Racel Johnson,Cathcart Index, Western Reserve Historical Society. In 1830, the Ohio bishopric ministry included Solomon King and his assistant Joshua Worley on the brethren's side, and Rachel Johnson and Nancy McNemar on the sisters' side.J.P. McLean, Shakers of Ohio, Fugitive Papers (1907), p. 72.

Membership Decline In 1818, Union Village was one of the largest Shaker settlements, with a population over 600, but by the 1830s there was a significant reduction in adult membership,Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers. Scarecrow Press; 11 August 2008. . p. xxxix. which was exacerbated in 1838 and 1839 due to strife among the members over ideological differences and accusations during the early years of Mother Ann's Work, also called the Era of Manifestations.Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers. Scarecrow Press; 11 August 2008. . p. 137. As their membership dropped, Elder Oliver C. Hampton (1817-1901) began publishing spiritual works and poetry about the Shaker sect to attract people to the sect. Even so, by the 1870s the community did not have enough adult members to do the work required to support the village's farms and industries which included broom making, garden seeds, medicinal herbs and extracts.name=\\"Paterwic p. 101\\">Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers. Scarecrow Press; 11 August 2008. . p. 101. Later Years In the 1880s, contrary to the Shaker Millennial Laws, they were increasingly in debt. About 1882 James Fennessey joined the community and soon implemented a plan to rent out land to farmers to create a revenue stream. In 1892 the North Union site was sold for $316,000 which was intended to pay off the debts incurred during the previous two decades. The money was mismanaged, though, by Joseph Slingerland. He spent about $500,000 on property purchases, improvements, and renovations, including building an ornate trustees' Office, now called Marble Hall. Contrary to Shaker practice, Slingerland mortgaged the Watervliet, Ohio, Shaker site to compensate for the expenditures and debt. Fennessey became a trustee and by 1902 had Slingerland removed from the Ohio ministry and filed suit against him and an eldress. By 1908 the Union Village ministry was free of debt.Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers. Scarecrow Press; 11 August 2008. . p. 78. In 1898 Elder Oliver Hampton attempted to create a settlement in Georgia at White Oak to create momentum for the flagging endeavor. However, Hampton died while on a visit there, and with his death came the end to the new settlement.Stephen J. Paterwic. Historical Dictionary of the Shakers.

Wisdom's Paradise In December 2004, United States Senator from Ohio, Rob Portman, and Cheryl Bauer published a book on the 19th century Shaker community at Union Village. The book was titled Wisdom's Paradise: The Forgotten Shakers of Union Village. At the end of the twelfth chapter, \\"An Eternal Sabbath, A Restless Peace,\\" Portman summarizes the dual aspects of Shaker impacts at the close of their way of life at Union Village as both warming to mainstream worldly culture and detrimental to long established order: Correctional institutions The Lebanon Correctional Institution and the Warren Correctional Institution, which are adjacent to one another, were built upon land that had been part of the Shaker settlement.

In June 2018 the company was sold to Cicero Communications.Press release announcing merger  Campaigns  = Campaign for High Speed Rail = Westbourne was involved in creating Campaign for High Speed Rail, a group promoting the HS2 transit line in London, whose spokesperson was Lucy James, a Westbourne employee. Westbourne organized a conference in 2011, attended by Transport secretary Philip Hammond, at which rail companies were asked to contribute ¬£10,000 each to the launch of the campaign. Westbourne chose not to emphasize the government's position that the project would speed transit times, instead seeking to redefine opposition for the ¬£33 billion project in terms of \\"posh nimbys\\" in the Chilterns worried about hunting rights. Posters for the campaign asked people to choose between \\"their lawns or our jobs\\". The company toured northern working-class cities by bus, working with politicians and celebrities to promote the project. The efforts were praised by transport minister Simon Burns, and Lord Adonis. The tactics were denounced by opposing group Spinwatch as \\"astroturfing\\", and cited as a case of the \\"triumph of vested interests and the power of their lobbying companies\\". Tactics described as \\"keeping a lid on protests\\" in a campaign involved a confrontational approach against the \\"insurgency tactics\\" of online campaigners. VICE quoted Bethell: \\"You've got to fight them on every street corner... You can't just sit and watch your opponents run around doing what they like. You‚Äôve got to get out into the bush, using their tactics and being in their face.\\" In comments made at a conference with U.S. high speed rail advocates in 2012, Westbourne had advised lobbyists to \\"pick off\\" opponents with \\"sniper-scope accuracy\\" and \\"shut them up\\" with aggressive rebuttal campaigns, which Bethell called an \\"exhausting but crucial\\" part of successful lobbying. The role of the government in spending public money on the lobbying was criticized, with Westbourne receiving over ¬£80,000 from HS2 Ltd, with an additional ¬£84,480 spent for two Westbourne staff working on secondment to HS2 Ltd, and a further ¬£24,000 paid to the firm by the Department for Transport. Another firm, Tomboy Films, was paid ¬£86,000 to create two informational videos supporting the project. = Other campaigns = The company also conducted a \\"Nothing British\\" PR campaign against the British National Party, enlisting military figures to promote their cause, and launched \\"Doctors for Reform\\", organizing 1000 doctors to call for changes to the National Health Service. \\"Nothing British\\" is described as \\"a viral video campaign led by Westbourne Communications and hosted by The Sun to counter the rise of the BNP following their success in the 2009 European Parliamentary elections.\\" It is described in a video featuring Simon Weston, one of four people profiled, as \\"a campaign against racism and extremism\\".

It is the third novel in The Lunar Chronicles series and the sequel to Scarlet. The story is loosely based on the fairy tale of \\"Rapunzel\\", similar to its predecessors Cinder and Scarlet which were loosely based on \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" respectively. Plot The novel begins with an introduction to Crescent \\"Cress\\" Moon Darnel, a sixteen-year- old girl living in a satellite in space that has been her prison for most of her life. She is contacted by Cinder, the main protagonist of the first novel, and her crew on Thorne's spaceship, the Rampion, through the D-COMM chip that had made Nainsi malfunction in the first book (she is the same girl that warned Cinder about Levana's ulterior motives of marrying Kai). After communicating with Cinder's crew, she asks them to rescue her from her satellite that she has been imprisoned on for seven years, which they say they will do. However, an unexpected visit from Thaumaturge Sybil Mira, who is Cress's guardian/captor, throws a wrench into the plans as she discovers Cress' intent to run and plans a trap for Cinder's crew. The trap results in the capture of Scarlet, the protagonist of the previous novel, and love interest of Wolf. Jacin Clay, a pilot who brought Sybil to Cress's satellite, decides to join Cinder's side, while the almost fatal wounding of Wolf renders him unconscious, and Sybil leaves Thorne and Cress to die after shutting down her satellite, making it hurtle toward Earth without a way to stop it. Meanwhile in Africa, Dr. Erland has discovered that Lunars are able to contract a mutated form of the letumosis virus which they had previously been immune to. The crew has now been separated from one another and Cinder is sure that not only are Cress and Thorne certainly dead but Scarlet will soon have the same fate as will Wolf if she doesn't get him medical attention. Cinder decides to land the Rampion in Africa where she was to meet Dr. Erland. She speaks with him, and he reveals that Lunars are able to contract a mutated version of the deadly virus that has been killing many Earthens for more than a decade. During this time, Scarlet is being held at an aristocratic Lunar household, being forced to be a \\"pet\\" for a young boy to practice his gift on. She is brought back to the palace, tried, and forced to cut off her own pinky finger. After Cress manages to deploy the parachutes of the free-falling satellite, they ensure a safe landing in the Sahara Desert. Unfortunately, Thorne has been blinded after hitting his head during the fall, and Cress must get him and herself out of the desert and somehow communicate with Cinder and the crew of the Rampion. Ever since she began tracking Thorne on assignment from Sybil Mira, Cress has been infatuated with him, and believes him to be her perfect hero. Thorne tries to convince her that he is not the hero she imagined, but promises her that if they are about to die, he will kiss her. They nearly die of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and starvation, but are saved by a traveling group of people who sell wares, (who are eventually revealed to be Lunar traffickers). They go to a hotel with the group, where Thorne manages to win an escort-droid by winning a card game. Cress, distraught and believing Thorne is \\"cheating\\" on her with another woman, decides to leave with the traffickers who had originally saved them. They kidnap Cress and take her to Dr. Erland, her father who didn't know that Cress is still alive, as she was taken away as a newborn to be killed. Cress becomes terrified and runs to hide, unknowingly hiding in the same room that Wolf is being kept in. She is discovered shortly after, and Thorne arrives to come save her. A while later, the group is discovered and forced out of hiding. The villagers (consisting of multiple Lunars) assist them in glamouring the military, aiding in Cinder and her group's escape. Once the entire group is reunited, Cinder plans an infiltration of the castle to stop the royal wedding between Earthen Emperor Kaito and Lunar Queen Levana, even though she knows it will start a war. She goes back home to see her legal guardian, Linh Adri, and her stepsister, Pearl, and glamours herself in order to steal their invitations. Cress and Wolf sneak into the palace, posing as a couple with the stolen invitations. Cinder and Iko sneak in through abandoned walkways. Thorne and Dr. Erland head to the labs to create stem cell eyedrops to repair Thorne's vision. While Cress and Wolf dismantle the security operations for the wedding site, Cinder and Iko (an android in the form of a human-escort droid, the one which Thorne won) kidnap Emperor Kaito by tranquilizing him and cutting out his ID chips, with the help of Konn Torin. Dr. Erland manages to repair Thorne's vision, but diagnoses himself with the fatal disease letumosis. After stopping the wedding, Cinder plans to take the crew to Luna, declare herself as the missing Princess Selene, and get the Lunars to rally around her to dethrone Levana. Dr. Erland quarantines himself after realizing he has been infected with a mutation of Letumosis, telling Cress that he is her father and that he loves her and never wanted to abandon her before he dies. Shortly after, Queen Levana and Sybil Mira come to see Dr. Erland, and he dies. Sybil receives an anonymous tip that the group is headed for the roof, preparing to leave. Before the party can leave, they are stopped by Sybil Mira and Lunar soldiers on the roof. Jacin is nowhere to be found. During the battle, Thorne kisses Cress, fulfilling the promise he made to her and also hinting that he has started to develop feelings for her. Cinder and Sybil Mira battle it out and Cinder succeeds in breaking Mira's mind, driving her insane which leads to her jumping off the roof to her death. They fly the Rampion en route to Luna, and Queen Levana retaliates by openly declaring war on Earth. It is also revealed that Princess Winter, the stepdaughter of Queen Levana, has Scarlet in her zoo-like menagerie. She is mentally unstable (afflicted with Lunar sickness) due to the fact that she refuses to use her Lunar gifts, but tells Scarlet that she is on Scarlet's side. Characters *Crescent \\"Cress\\" Moon Darnel: A prisoner in the beginning of the book, this character resembles Rapunzel from the fairy-tale genre, with long, blonde hair and a lifetime of being isolated in a prison by a witch. After being cast down to Earth and presumed dead, Cress travels with Thorne for many days to reunite with Cinder and the rest of the crew. She is exceptionally gifted at programming and hacking, having been the queen's programmer for many years. In the first book, she is the girl that warns Cinder about Levana's ulterior motives. *Carswell Thorne: A citizen of the American Republic, Thorne is wanted by several governments for crimes he has committed, the last of which was breaking out of prison with Cinder in the novel Scarlet. In this book, he is blinded and stays that way for the rest of the novel. He is arrogant yet Cress has feelings for him and consistently sees the good in him. *Linh Cinder: A young female cyborg mechanic and main protagonist in The Lunar Chronicles. Revealed as the Lunar Princess Selene in Cinder, she is the missing heir to the throne of Luna and niece of Queen Levana. *Emperor Kaito: Emperor of the Eastern Commonwealth. He is engaged to Queen Levana but is in love with Cinder and is only marrying the Queen of Luna to save the lives of his people. *Dr. Erland/ Dr. Sage Darnel: Lunar fugitive that took care of Cinder in the first book after spending many years looking for her. His disguised last name is an anagram of his real last name. He dies from a mutated version of the Letumosis virus in this novel. He is also the father of Cress and believed her to be dead since she was taken from him. He reveals himself as her father to her as he is dying. He dies when Queen Levana finally discovers he's located on Earth and comes to visit him and tell him that she will be crowned empress. *Jacin Clay: The pilot who brings Sybil Mira to Cress' satellite. He is glamoured by Mira to look like Scarlet to confuse Cinder's side during the battle, but decides to join Cinder's side halfway through Scarlet's kidnapping. He is concerned with Princess Winter's fate and will do anything to protect her. *Ze'ev \\"Wolf\\" Kesley: A genetically-modified former Lunar special operative that is Scarlet's love interest. After Scarlet is kidnapped, he falls into a deep depression over being unable to save her. *Sybil Mira: Cress's captor who forced Cress to do Queen Levana's bidding for many years. She is Queen Levana's right hand and has complete loyalty to Levana. Goes mad at the end due to Cinder's Lunar manipulation and throws herself off a roof. *Iko: Cinder's android partner. She is given a new android body by Thorne when he meets up with them again and she is in love with it. *Queen Levana: The cruel queen of Luna, the moon colony. Not above using terrorist and genocidal tactics to obtain power, she is partially responsible for the existence of the plague on Earth since many of her subjects flee there to escape her influence. She uses a powerful glamour to force people to do her bidding. She is likely based on the Evil Queen of Snow White's history. *Scarlet Benoit: Previous protagonist who joined Cinder, Wolf, Thorne, and later, Cress, to stop Queen Levana from marrying Emperor Kai. She is kidnapped by Sybil Mira and her life is saved by Princess Winter. *Princess Winter: The step-daughter of Queen Levana, who has a marred face rumored to be forced upon herself at thirteen because she was more beautiful than the Queen. She has become slightly crazy because she has refused to use her Lunar gifts since she was twelve.

It served the Northern Berkshire communities of Adams, Cheshire, Clarksburg, Florida, Lanesborough, North Adams, Savoy, Williamstown and communities in southern Vermont and in eastern New York state. The hospital was part of Northern Berkshire Healthcare (NBH), a not-for-profit organization. NBH closed it on March 28, 2014. History The hospital opened March 2, 1884 and the original building was expanded over time. A completely new hospital building on the same campus opened in 1955. In the 1980s the North Adams Hospital (now known as the North Adams Regional Hospital or NARH) was quite full. However, better medications and treatments for chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and asthma reduced the need for inpatient hospitalizations and many surgical procedures which had once occurred in the inpatient setting shifted to outpatient facilities. Beset by chronically low inpatient censuses in recent years, declining reimbursement from Medicaid and Medicare, and facing rising costs, many rural hospitals, not just NARH, struggled to stay alive. Some turned to larger health systems for financial backing, partnership, or mergers. NARH went through Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 2011 and built an affiliation with Berkshire Medical Center (BMC) in Pittsfield, MA. They did not merge however, due to NARH‚Äôs bond debt and existing union contracts. After closing its doors in March 2014, NARH declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 3, 2014,United States Bankruptcy Court ‚Äì District of Massachusetts - Case 14-30327 Doc 1 at which point BMC committed to purchase the facility through the bankruptcy process.

VI.11) The Varaha Upanishad (IV) refers to the Bhumika ('stage of development of wisdom') which is of the form of pranava (Aum or Om) as formed of or divided into ‚Äì akƒÅra, ukƒÅra, makƒÅra and ardhmƒÅtra, which is on account of the difference of sthula ('gross'), sukshama ('subtle'), bija ('seed' or 'causal') and sakshi ('witness') whose avasthas ('states') are ‚Äì 'waking', 'dreaming', 'dream-less sleep' and 'turiya'. Sakshi which is 'turiya' is the essence. Panini Panini states that the same indicates a direct seer or eyewitness (Panini Sutras V.ii.91), Sakshi means Ishvara, the ‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§æ (cetƒÅ), the sole Self-consciousness, who is the witness of all, who gives consciousness to every human being, thereby making each rational and discriminatory. Vedanta Vedanta speaks of mind (chitta) or antahkarana ('internal instrument'), and matter as the subtle and gross forms of one and the same reality; being the subtle aspect of matter, mind is not a tangible reality. The field of mind (Chittakasha) involves the duality of the seer and the seen, the observer (drg) and the observed (drshya), which duality is overcome in the field of pure Consciousness. Drg-drshya-Viveka tells us:- :\\"When form is the object of observation or drshyam, then the eye is the observer or drk; when the eye is the object of observation, then the mind is the observer; when the pulsations of the mind are the objects of observation, then Sakshi or the Witnessing-Self is the real observer; and it is always the observer, and, being self-luminous, can never be the object of observation. When the notion and the attachment that one is the physical body is dissolved, and the Supreme Self is realized, wherever one goes, there one experiences Samadhi. \\" Sankara explains that knowledge does not destroy or create, it only illumines, that the senses (indriyas) are not the mind, the mind uses them as an implement.

Hart Bochner, Jane Seymour, Robert Carradine, Ian Charleson and Leonard Nimoy have starring roles. It aired on NBC on Sunday, December 9, and Monday, December 10, from 9-11 pm. Plot American expatriates journalist Jake Barnes (Hart Bochner), war veteran Bill Gorton (≈Ωeljko Ivanek), and novelist/boxer Robert Cohn (Robert Carradine), take advantage of the Paris night life. Barnes meets former paramour Lady Brett Ashley (Jane Seymour) who is about to divorce her husband to marry Scotsman Mike Campbell (Ian Charleson). Barnes' attraction to Ashley causes him to follow her movements and Gorton and Cohn follow as Cohn becomes enamored as well. Ashley expresses continuing interest in open relations. The group ventures to see bullfighting in Pamplona, Spain, where Ashley develops an appetite for matador Pedro Romero (Andrea Occhipinti). Cohn pummels Romero upon discovering her latest conquest although it does not impress Ashley. A bruised Romero enters the bullring as the curtains come down. Cast *Hart Bochner as Jake Barnes *Jane Seymour as Brett Ashley *Robert Carradine as Robert Cohn *≈Ωeljko Ivanek as Bill Gorton *Ian Charleson as Mike Campbell *Leonard Nimoy as Count Mippipopolous *St√©phane Audran as Georgette *Andrea Occhipinti as Pedro Romero *√âlisabeth Bourgine as Nicole *Hutton Cobb as Chaz *Jennifer Hilary as Frances Clyne *Arch Taylor as Lew Braddocks *Renata Benedict as Eve Braddocks *Julian Sands as Gerald Production NBC had to acquire the production rights from 20th Century Fox, which produced the 1957 film adaptation. Like the source, the work is set in France and Spain. In an attempt to be true to the 1920s setting, some Pamplona scenes were shot in Segovia and some Paris scenes were shot in Versailles, because Paris and Pamplona did not look as they had 60 years earlier. Critical commentary According to John J. O'Connor of The New York Times virtually all nuances that differed from the source were not well executed. People Fred Hauptfuhrer notes that \\"Hemingway purists\\" may be offended by some of the changes. Arthur Unger of The Christian Science Monitor described this production as \\"a minor literary classic, which has now been turned into a major miniseries disaster\\". Stephen Farber of The New York Times recounts numerous elements depicted in the film that were not in the source material such as > A grieving Jake Barnes attends the funeral of a prostitute he had visited > several times before being wounded and rendered impotent in World War I. > Pedro Romero, the handsome young Spanish bull fighter, uses his sword to > murder a vindictive count who has threatened the life of Lady Brett Ashley. > Jake's best friend, Bill Gorton, takes an airplane, goes up on a daredevil > flight and crashes to his death. Screenwriter Robert L. Joseph defends the addition of mortally wounded characters as necessary for dramatic depiction. While the 1957 film starred a 43-year-old Tyrone Power and 34-year-old Ava Gardner, the 1984 adaptation starred a 27-year-old Bochner and 33-year-old Seymour, who the filmmakers thought could better depict the youthful characters of the source novel.
