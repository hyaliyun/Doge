They were formed in 2006 by lead singer Nachman Solomon and released two albums, The Source (2007) and World On Its Side (2010). History Origins (2006-2007) Lead singer and founder Nachman Solomon grew up in Mevo Modi'im, a communal village founded by the late Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. He is the son of Diaspora Yeshiva Band violinist and founding member Ben Zion Solomon, while his brothers Noah, Yehuda, Meir, and Yosef formed the influential Jewish rock bands Moshav Band and Soulfarm. Nachman performed with his family regularly from a young age. Hamakor was formed at Mevo Modi'im in January 2006 by Solomon and lead guitarist Lazer Grunwald, although the latter was replaced with Yakir Hyman after he moved to the United States a few months later. During the band's first year together, they opened for Moshav Band and Aharit Hayamim and became monthly fixtures at the local Mike's Place. The Source (2006-2010) After a brief US tour, and after about a year of frequent gigging around Jerusalem, HaMakor began recording their debut album, The Source, in the winter of 2006-07. At this point, the band consisted of Yakir Hyman on guitar, Jono Landon on drums, Zechariah Reich on bass, and Ben Frimmer on keys. Shortly after completing the recording, Hyman and Reich were drafted into the Israel Defense Forces. Reich was replaced by bassist Jonathan Fialka. The album was released on May 11, 2007. Near the end of the year, the band was recruited for a 10-city tour of Poland by the country's Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich. World On Its Side and break-up (2010-2015) The band released their second album, World On Its Side, on July 20, 2010. By this time, the band had acquired guitarist Bruce Burger, a solo artist under the name RebbeSoul, as well as keyboardist Gavriel Saks, bassist Yosef Solomon, and drummer Eliezer Grundman. The album spawned two singles, \\"Illusion\\" and \\"Memories\\". After a period of inactivity, the band resurfaced in 2014 with the Solomon brothers accompanied by guitarist Ben Katz, keyboardist Mendy Portnoy, and drummer Chemy Soibelman, formerly of The Groggers. The band released a single, \\"Lift Me Up\\", and announced plans for a third album of the same name. However, in a 2016 interview, Nachman Solomon confirmed that, following several member departures, the band had \\"kind of died out\\" a few years prior. He, Yosef, and brother Sruli Solomon currently perform as The Solomon Brothers. Musical style Hamakor played a mix of grunge, trance fusion, folk, and classic rock music with Hebrew and English lyrics. Band members have cited influences from Pearl Jam, Phish, and Disco Biscuits. Lead singer Nachman Solomon's songwriting was influenced by funk, reggae, jam band, and blues music, and the group's concerts often featured covers of The Who and The Grateful Dead, as well as Jewish artists like Shlomo Carlebach. Although many of Hamakor's lyrics were religious-themed, Solomon has argued that non-Jews can also enjoy their music, saying, \\"The words are meaningful and spiritual, but we don't play mostly songs based on biblical verses\\".

Symptoms include stunted growth and leaves turning red. It is caused by the bacterium Spiroplasma kunkelii.https://www.freshfromflorida.com/content/download/11380/144576/pp373.pdf Corn Stunt leaves  Disease Cycle  S. kunkelii, a spiroplasma often referred to as Corn Stunt Spiroplasma, can survive and overwinter in D. maidis (DeLong and Wolcott), which infects corn plants in the spring and causes Corn Stunt disease. It has been reported in the San Joaquin Valley in California that volunteer plants are critical to help leafhoppers survive in the winter, where volunteer plants can give an extra two months of season to the leafhoppers. This pathogen has been described as propagative persistent and circulative, accumulating and replicating in the vector where it has been found in the hemolymph, cells of the gut, and salivary glands of insect vectors. During feeding it is delivered to the phloem tissue of the host corn plant. There is an important relationship that S. kunkelii has with D. maidis, where its survival over the winter depends on the survival of the leafhopper. This relationship may also be beneficial for D. maidis. When Dalbulus leafhoppers are infected with S. kunkelii, it has been reported that fertility and life-expectancy are diminished. However, specific to D. maidis, one study suggests that the presence of S. kunkelii increases chances of D. maidis survival in colder weather, specifically 10-20 degrees Celsius, when either given oats or lived on moist sand, although this effect on survival was not found to be true in the case of freezing temperatures. Similarly, one group suggests that the spiroplasma may provide useful metabolites for its leafhopper vector. S. Kunkelii can be transmitted by other leafhopper genera, however the leafhopper D. maidis is of most significance in Latin America.  Management  The most effective way to control Corn Stunt is early planting. Although Corn Stunt can impact corn planted in early months like April or March, the greatest damage affects corn planted after July. Chemicals like insecticides can be used to control D. maidis, however, the use of this method to control Corn Stunt is not very successful. In sweet corn, reflective mulches can be an effective way to control D. maidis and the disease it vectors, compared to insecticides. Mulching should be performed early in the plant‚Äôs development to properly control this disease, as greater damage happens if the plant host is younger when infected with Corn Stunt disease. Although D. maidis is the major vector for S. kunkelii, one study calls for a focus on all vectors that can transmit Corn Stunt disease, since, in addition to D. maidis, three other species of Dalbulus are able to spread and carry Corn Stunt Spiroplasma.  Importance  S. kunkelii, the Corn Stunt Spiroplasma, was characterized as the causative agent of Corn Stunt disease by Whitcomb et al. in 1986. In the literature, the combination of maize bushy stunt mycoplasma and maize rayado fino maravirus in addition to S. kunkelii has been called the Corn Stunt disease complex, also called ‚Äúachaparramiento.‚Äù The combination of these diseases is devastating and all of these can be transmitted by D. maidis. Because of the pathogens and it can transmit, D. maidis is of great financial importance in Latin America. Also, maize chlorotic dwarf virus has also been reported to be implicated in Corn Stunt disease. When Corn Stunt Spiroplasma and maize bushy stunt mycoplasma may co- occur, the disease that they can cause has been referred to as ‚Äúpuca poncho‚Äù due to its red coloring of the diseased maize. Different combinations of these pathogens are notably present and cause serious problems in yield production in Central America, reported in Nicaragua, Peru, and Argentina, and the southern part of the United States, where it was reported in California and Florida. Despite the common co-occurrence with other causative agents, S. kunkelii is the most prevalent in the subtropics as the causative agent of Corn Stunt disease and can be quite devastating.

These terms provide a theoretical framework for helping literary analysts to conceptualize the ways in which readers redirect their attention away from their immediate surroundings as they become immersed in the reality generated by the text. Deixis The term \\"deixis\\" refers to the ways in which language encodes contextual information into its grammatical system. More broadly, deixis refers to the inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs. To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the \\"here\\" and \\"now\\" (proximal deixis) from the \\"then\\" and \\"there\\" (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, \\"When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion- specific considerations.\\" Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story's characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. \\"Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation\\". Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative. Labov's narrative model When examining perspectives on narration in natural-language environments, one must not ignore William Labov, who argues that stories of personal experience can be divided into distinct sections, each of which serves a unique function within the narrative progression. Labov schematizes the organization of natural narrative using the following conceptual units: abstract, orientation, complicating action, resolution, evaluation, and coda. Generally, anecdotal narratives tend to arrange these units in the order outlined; however, this is not an inflexible, structural progression that defines how every narrative must develop. For instance, sentences and phrasal items that serve an evaluative function can be interspersed throughout a narrative. Some stretches of narrative discourse also feature overlap among these Labovian categories. Each of Labov's narrative divisions serves a characteristic purpose typified by a particular section's grammatical construction and functional role within the unfolding narrative, but the boundaries of such divisions are not always clear-cut. As a feature of natural language, deixis is an important element of oral narrative and can be realized in different ways in each of Labov's categories. According to Galbraith, \\"All language use depends on some felt relevance to situation, on the attention of participants, and their ability to lift out the topic....Like zero in mathematics and the dark space in the theater, deixis orients us within a situation without calling attention to itself\\". Two of Labov's categories that often feature deixis prominently are the \\"orientation\\" and the \\"coda\\". The orientation typically occurs near the beginning of a narrative and serves to introduce the characters, settings, and events. Given its presentative quality, the orientation shifts the deictic center away from the speaker's here-and-now into the spatiotemporal coordinates of the story, which logically must occur at a time prior to the story's enunciation. The coda occurs toward the end of a narrative and functions as a means of terminating the flow of story events. By doing so, the coda reorients the speakers and listeners out of the story world and back into the communicative present.  Deictic center  The deictic center‚Äîsometimes called the \\"origo\\" or zero-point‚Äîrepresents the originating source in relation to which deictic expressions gain their context-dependent meaning. Often the deictic center is the speaker: thus, any tokens of \\"I\\" in the speaker's discourse must deictically refer back to the speaker as center; likewise, the word \\"you\\" must project outward from this center toward the addressee. Any participants not part of this communicative channel will be referred to in the third person. The theory of deixis is therefore egocentric in that the indexical anchorage of deictic expressions is a function of this zero-point of subjectivity. The \\"I\\"-center serves as the perceptual vantage point that surveys relations among salient contextual entities and events. Such a center, therefore, determines which deictic expressions are pragmatically licensed by a context that has been naturally delimited through this perceptual and evaluative locus. Thus, the appropriateness of a proximal \\"this\\" over a distal \\"that\\" is determined by the nearness of an object or a location in relation to the deictic zero-point. A deictic field contains the range of bounded participants and objects, spatial locations and landmarks, and temporal frames that point back to some deictic center as the source for their pragmatic demarcation. The deictic field radiates out from the deictic center, and the boundaries of such a field enclose the scope of objects, spaces, and events that constitute a set from which deictic expressions might seek out a potential referent. These fields function as cognitive frames that participants in a discourse can use to conceptualize their contextual surroundings in relation to each interlocutor's (alternating) function as deictic center across communicative turns. Within the context of literature, the presence of multiple deictic fields in a text can be fruitfully analyzed using the cognitive principle of deictic shift (discussed below).  Deictic shift theory  Deictic shift theory (DST) refers to a range of immersion processes by which readers imaginatively project hypothetical deictic centers that are anchored to communicative and experiential loci within a narrative. Such cognitive framing, theorists of DST argue, form a necessary part of the reader's involvement in narrative, whereby through a process of frame shifting the reader constructs a story world by interpreting the (deictic) cues instantiated in the text. Deictic shifting can be accomplished in several ways. The most basic shift involves the reader's initial immersion into the world of the story. Here the deictic center moves out of the here-and-now of the reader's physical environment and becomes anchored to some text-internal perceptual or presentative instance, in most cases the deictic center of a character or a narrator. Deictic shifts at the level of narration include those cues that implicate a covert or overt narrator‚Äîspecifically, story commentary or instances when the narrator refers to himself or herself as an \\"I.\\" Such instances of commentary and evaluation often reflect the perceptual field, as well as the interpretive and ideological stance, of the narrator as he or she presents the story's events. Within the world of the story, deictic shifts occur in a number of ways. A fundamental shift occurs when the deictic center moves from one character to another‚Äîfor instance, in cases of omniscient thought report. Here the reader must adjust the deictic center accordingly and interprets the lens of the current focal window through the experiential subjectivity of the character- locus. Other forms of story-internal deictic shifts involve the cognitive framing associated with embedded narratives and other discourse-types: stories-within-stories, letters in epistolary fiction, diary entries, hypertext ruptures, etc. \\"Within literary scholarship, it is often noted that first and second person pronouns (and less so, and differently, third) facilitate readerly identification with the textually inscribed position (the position of the character or narrator designated by that pronoun), and evoke a sense of readerly conceptual immersion in the fictional world of the story, contributing to the ways in which the scene is imaginatively 'realized' in the mind of the reader, particularly the perspective from which the scene is conceptually visualized. Cognitive poetics and cognitive narratology have employed deictic shift theory, largely based on the work of Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt, to attempt to offer a cognitive account of how these interpretative effects are created. DST proposes that readers conceptually project to the contextual locus of the speaker of deictic cues in order to comprehend them, offering a model of how the deictic referents determining such contextual coordinates are processed by readers, and how this contributes to readers' conceptualization of the world of the story\\" (Deictic shifting in literature: Experimental analysis).  Deixis in narratology  Buhler applied the theory of deixis to narratives. He proposed the concept of Zeigfeld, or deictic field, which operates in three modes: the first, ad oculos, \\"operates in the here-and-now of the speaker's sensible environment;\\" the second, anaphora, \\"operates in the context of the discourse itself considered as a structured environment;\\" and the third, what Buhler calls deixis at phantasma, operates in the context \\"of imagination and long-term memory.\\" Buhler's model attempts \\"to describe the psychological and physical process whereby the live deictic field of our own bodily orientation and experience\\" is \\"transposed into an imaginative construction.\\" According to Buhler, \\"the body-feeling representation, or K√∂rpertastbild (what psychologists would probably now call the body schema), becomes loosened from its involvement with the HERE//NOW/I deictic coordinates of waking life in our immediate environment, and becomes available to translation into an environment we construct both conceptually and orientationally\\"; this deictic coordinate system is used \\"in the constructive environment to orient ourselves within 'the somewhere-realm of pure imagination and the there-and-there in memory'\\". Katie Hamburger, a German narrative theorist, studied and theorized how deictic words are used in literature. In her work The Logic of Literature, she argued that there are two realms of language act: reality statement and fiction (Galbraith, 24-25). Reality statements are by someone and about something. \\"Acts of fictional narration, on the other hand, transfer their referentiality from the actuality of the historical world to the entertained reality of the fictive world, and transfer the subjectivity of the speaker to the subjectivity of the story world characters\\". Hamburger argued that this transfer occurs due to the use of deictic adverbs, and psychological verbs.

It is known for its localist stances and militant tendency of protesting. It has been actively involved in protests and engaged into violent clashes with police, including in the anti-parallel trading protests and the Mong Kok unrest. Ray Wong Toi-yeung is the former convenor and key figure of the group.  Beliefs  Hong Kong Indigenous states that it opposes the increased influence of mainland China and the Beijing government's involvement in Hong Kong. It opposes the increased use of standard Mandarin in Hong Kong schools instead of the native Cantonese. It also claims that the growing number of mainland migrants ‚Äì due to the issuing of one-way travel permits to mainlanders over which Hong Kong has no control whatsoever ‚Äì would have the effect of \\"diluting the ratio of local people\\" and depriving the locals' resources,\\" especially in primary schools, public housing and certain jobs. It argues that a mainland \\"incursion\\" is stripping residents of their identity and rights. The group has criticised the pan-democracy camp's \\"gentle approach\\" of non-violent civil disobedience and calls for a \\"militant\\" approach by \\"bravery and force\\". The group pushes for secession from China.  History  Hong Kong Indigenous in Liberate Yuen Long protest. Hong Kong Indigenous was set up by a group of youngsters who participated in the 2014 Hong Kong protests in January 2015. It organised anti-parallel trading protests with another nativist group Civic Passion against the growing influx of mainland Chinese shoppers engaging in parallel trading in early 2015, aggressively picketing the alleged shoppers and having clashes with the police. After the third demonstration, the central government said it would restrict Shenzhen residents to one visit a week. In July 2015, Hong Kong Indigenous marched to the Immigration Department to demand deportation of an undocumented 12-year-old Mainland boy Siu Yau-wai, who lived in Hong Kong for nine years without identification, with other nativists including Youngspiration. In January 2016, the group announced the candidacy of its 24 year old member Edward Leung Tin-kei for the 2016 New Territories East by- election which was triggered by the resignation of Civic Party legislator Ronny Tong. Leung received 66,524 votes, about 15 percent of the total votes, behind pan-democratic Civic Party and pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. The better-than-expected result was considered a big boost for the localist cause. In February 2016, the group was actively involved in violent clashes with police in Mong Kok arising from the group's call for action to protect illegal street hawkers from a government crackdown. Spokesman and Legislative Council by-election candidate Edward Leung Tin-kei and around 20 members and volunteers of the group were arrested. Convenor Ray Wong Toi-yeung dismissed the claim that they incited the violent clashes and stated that they were only there to defend the street hawkers. In the 2016 Legislative Council election, Edward Leung intended to run in once again New Territories East. The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) carried out a new election measure, requiring all candidates to sign an additional \\"confirmation form\\" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Leung initially refused to sign the form but later agreed to sign the form after the court refused to immediately hear the judicial review. Leung was banned along with five other pro-independence activists after the end of the nomination period. In November 2017, Ray Wong who was charged for instigating riot, joint incitement and inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly failed to report to the police and return his travel documents to the court on 22 November after a judge-approved trip to Europe on condition of a HK$100,000 cash bail. The High Court issued an arrest warrant. According to pro-Beijing newspaper Wen Wei Po, Wong had absconded to the UK. On 18 December 2017, Edward Leung announced his departure from the Hong Kong Indigenous as spokesman ahead of his trial of instigating riot among other charges.

So, instead of trying to exalt the Poet by his work, I have tried rather to show the Man in his poetry.\\" Stephens concluded the volume by including his memoir of the poet.

G. Stephens, shows as plainly as do the verses themselves how their author possessed the qualifications necessary to an Australian poet. His faculty of versification, though wholly untrained, sufficed for the production of lines whose rugged character ‚Äî even to the substitution of assonance for rhyme ‚Äî is appropriate enough to a bushman's lays of the bush, and will offend those only of his readers who value nicety of literary, workmanship. His experiences as surveyor, as boundary-rider, and in travelling with stock, gave him practical and varied knowledge of the life and scenes of inland Australia; while the natural and, perhaps, hereditary disposition of his mind enabled him to discern their picturesque and romantic aspects.\\"\\"New Books and New Editions\\", The Town and Country Journal, 4 September 1897, p24 See also * 1897 in Australian literature * 1897 in poetry References 1897 poetry books Australian poetry collections Angus & Robertson books ","title":"Where the Dead Men Lie, and Other Poems"},{"id":"48748852","text":"Vibert Durdy Butts was a Guyanese soccer player best known for scoring Guyana's first-ever World Cup qualifying goal, during a 1976 match against Suriname, which helped Guyana to a 2-0 victory.

Cold War  The 166th Infantry Regiment was reorganized on 11 November 1946 as part of the Ohio National Guard. On 1 September 1959, it became a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. It consisted of the 1st Battle Group, part of the 37th Infantry Division. It was reorganized on 1 April 1963 to consist of the 1st Battalion, still part of the 37th. It was again reorganized on 15 February 1968 to consist of the 1st Battalion and was transferred to the 38th Infantry Division. It was transferred on 1 March 1977 to the 73rd Infantry Brigade. On 1 May 1989, it was withdrawn from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the U.S. Army Regimental System. It was consolidated on 1 September 1992 with the 148th Infantry Regiment. The new unit, designated the 148th Infantry, consisted of the 1st Battalion of that regiment, part of the 73rd Infantry Brigade. Its new headquarters was at Lima, Ohio.

It is a National Monument. Location Rath Meave is located in the Tara- Skryne Valley, south of the Hill of Tara and east of Kilmessan. Description The remains of Rath Meave consist of an approximately circular henge, about 700 metres long, enclosing an area of about 4 hectares. A cut on the north side of Rath Medb's bank, presumably the entrance, is aligned with the oldest site at Tara, the Mound of the Hostages. History Rath Meave was constructed during the fourth phase of Tara's building, in the early Bronze Age (c. 2000‚Äì1500 BC). This was around the same time as the Mound of the Hostages was used for burials. It takes its name from Medb Lethderg, a Celtic sovereignty goddess who in Irish legend was the wife or lover of nine successive Kings of Tara. Her relationship to the better-known Medb of Cruachan, legendary Queen of Connacht, is unclear; they may be the same character, or one may have inspired the other. The name Medb means \\"intoxicator\\" and is cognate with \\"mead,\\" making clear the connection between the marriage of the king to the sovereignty goddess and the use of alcohol at these ceremonies. Conservation Despite its antiquity, Rath Meave remains farmland in private ownership. Controversy was aroused in 2008 when the rath was planted with kale, a deep-growing vegetable with a long tap root. Its harvesting potentially damaged archaeological remains undiscovered on the rath.

A cohort of biologists and science educators, the AMS's members use a wide array of microscopical techniques (light microscopy, electron microscopy, fluorescence and confocal microscopes) to further their research and eventually publish their research in its journal Invertebrate Biology. Yearly meetings conducted by the AMS focus on innovation in current microscopy techniques. Workshops conducted by the AMS are focused not only on microscopy techniques themselves, but also on the organisms that current members are studying with these microscopy techniques.  History  Founded in 1878 as an outgrowth of the first National Microscopical Congress, the first members of the AMS were biologists, medical doctors, and dentists interested in incorporating light microscopy into their clinical work. During this time period, the compound microscope was a new technology and the AMS was purposed with exploiting its possibilities in the fields of medicine and bacteriology.  Early Leadership  Alpheus Baker Hervey was the chairman of the first congress. Trained as a marine biologist, his research focused on algae. Dr. R.H. Ward, a medical doctor, was the first President of the AMS. His son, Henry B. Ward was an early twentieth century biologist and later went on to serve as a subsequent AMS president. Other early leaders of AMS included * Hamilton Smith, whose was known for his work on marine algae * Jacob D. Cox, a microscopical technologist who also served as the governor of Ohio * Thomas J. Burrill, a bacteriologist, and, * David S. Kellicott, a protozoologist. The collection of prominent scientists who belonged to the AMS also included: L.M. Vorce, Dr. George Edward Fell, E. and W. Bausch, G.E. Blackham, and C.A. Spencer. Oliver Wendell Holmes was an early associate. Simon Henry Gage, the author of a book on the microscope with 17 editions published between 1880‚Äì1943, served as the AMS President twice since its inception. Charles A. Spencer and Robert B. Tolles, renowned microscope makers, were honored by the production of the Spencer-Tolles Memorial Fund, which continues to promote publications in the field of microscopical research today.  Early Meetings  Early AMS meetings functioned as social and scientific gatherings, and were heavily covered by the press. Public admission was encouraged by demonstrations on biological specimens that highlighted the importance of microscopes and microscopy to the general public.  Publications  The AMS published one America's first scientific journals, Invertebrate Biology (1995‚Äìpresent), which has gone under the names Proceedings of the American Society of Microscopists (1880-1891), Proceedings of the American Microscopical Society(1892-1894), and Transactions of the American Microscopical Society (1895-1994). At its inception, these publications welcomed research about the practical applications of microscopy on a range of biological fields including study of protozoa, algae, fungi, vascular plants, bacteria, invertebrates, and vertebrate histology and cytology. However, as the publication shifted to focus on invertebrate biology, the name was changed from Transactions of the American Microscopical Society to Invertebrate Biology in order to better represent this shift. The new publication continued Transactions from volume 114, and currently its content centers around all aspects of the biology of invertebrates‚Äìnot only microscopy, but also research involving cellular and molecular biology, ecology, physiology, genetics, systematics, behavior, and biogeography. The current research goals of Invertebrate Biology describes its research goals as spanning the fields of \\"morphology and ultrastructure, genetics and phylogenetics, evolution, physiology and ecology, neurobiology, behavior and biomechanics, reproduction and development\\" and includes \\"cell and molecular biology related to all types of invertebrates: protozoan and metazoan, aquatic and terrestrial, free-living and symbiotic\\". The AMS guidelines specify that discussions of taxonomy as strictly complementary to these research goals, and should function as a secondary component.  Symposiums and Meetings   Student Awards  The AMS awards a certificate and a monetary prize for the Best Contributed Paper, original research that is presented by a student at the AMS Annual Meeting. Only students or graduates who have not received a degree more than 12 months before the meeting are eligible to compete for the awards.  Photomicrography Contest  The AMS also awards the Ralph and Mildred Buchsbaum Prize for Excellence in Photomicrography in honor of Ralph Buchsbaum, American zoologist, ecologist, and invertebrate biologist, and his wife Mildred Buchsbaum, who first worked as his research assistant and later helped him in creating the first chimera between the green algae Chlorella and chick fibroblast cells. * There are two categories: color and black-and-white photomicrographs. * Only photomicrographs that taken with transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and any kind of light microscopy, including confocal scanning laser microscopy, are eligible.  Funding and Fellowships   Student Research Funding  The AMS Student Research Fellowship funds are offered to university students as financial assistance for summer research projects involving microscopy. There are two fellowships of $1000 each that the AMS awards to students. Undergraduate and graduate proposals are assessed separately. The guidelines apply to any undergraduate or graduate student who is a member of the AMS, with the exception of students who received this award in the past.  AMS Student Travel Awards  AMS Travel awards are funds of $250 for transportation to the annual AMS meetings, which are joint endeavors between the AMS and the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology. The AMS offers financial awards to three student members who are chosen to present at the annual AMS/SICB 2016 meeting in Portland, Oregon, in early January.  AMS Microscopy Training Fellowships  The AMS Microscopy Training Fellowship funds are for support of graduate students and faculty members at the beginning of their careers. The funds are for training in new microscopy techniques. There are two fellowships of $1000 each are available each year, and the training may be obtained either through public courses and workshops or through private courses taken at other institutions. The guidelines apply to any graduate student or early career faculty member who is a full member of AMS, again with the exception of past fellowship recipients. Applications from graduates students and faculty members are also assessed independently and awards are rewarded at a maximum of $1000.

Jean-Baptiste Decoster (1760‚Äì1826) was a Brabantian farmer who became an unwilling guide for Napoleon Bonaparte during the Battle of Waterloo and later became a tourist battle field guide in the years following the battle. Biography Decoster was born 13 October 1760 to Willem de Koster and Anna-Maria de Smet in the village of Korbeek-Lo near Leuven in Flemish Brabant. The contemporary spelling of his surname was usually De Coster, with alternative spellings of De Koster, Dekoster and even Lacoste in some French documents. By 1815 he resided near Plancenoit in Walloon Brabant. Early on 18 June 1815, after he had been to church, he went to the house of his brother in Plancenoit. There he was accosted by French staff officers and escorted to see Napoleon, who, having ascertained that he knew the locality, employed him as a local guide during the Battle of Waterloo. Decoster was an unwilling guide, but his recollections form an important primary source for the locations where Napoleon resided during the battle. Decoster's house (c. 1900) Decoster's house stood on the eastern side of the Waterloo‚ÄìGenappe main road south of the junction with the minor road to Plancenoit (south of La Belle Alliance and north of the farm of Rossomme). According to Decoster, Napoleon spent the early part of the Battle of Waterloo around Rossomme and then at about 17:00 moved to a hillock or a mound close to Decoster's house, where he remained until about 19:00. He then moved forward with his staff officers and the unwilling Decoster, to a location in the valley to the north of La Belle Alliance (and thus closer to the front line), and remained there during the attack by the French Imperial Guard. Then, according to Decoster, he accompanied Napoleon as far as Genappe during his flight after the retreat of the Guard and the general route that ensued. \\"Flight of Buonaparte from the field of Waterloo accompanied by his guide\\", engraving by George Cruikshank. In the months after the battle, he was sought out by battle field tourists. Walter Scott wrote that he did not seem to have realised that he could charge these tourists for his services until Scott took a deposition from him and suggested that tourists such as himself would be willing to pay Decoster for guidance around the battlefield and to hear his reminiscences about the day. He continued guiding for twelve years, which was quite lucrative; in 1826 or 1827 his heirs purportedly inherited 300,000 francs.

Artwork Marion Satterlee was a friend of the naturalist and author Frances Theodora Parsons, and their walks together inspired Parsons to sit down and write her long-meditated first book, How to Know the Wild Flowers (1893). At Parsons' insistence, Satterlee illustrated both this book and its sequel, How to Know the Ferns (1899). For How to Know the Wild Flowers‚Äîwhich was the first field guide to North American wildflowers and a great popular success that stayed in print into the 1940s‚Äîshe created 110 full-page black-and-white illustrations, which were complemented by color plates by Elsie Louise Shaw. The writer and New Yorker editor Katharine Sergeant Angell White, writing many decades later, termed the book a classic and remarked on the excellence of Satterlee's line drawings. For How to Know the Ferns, Satterlee and a second artist, Alice Josephine Smith, created 42 full-page plates and over two dozen smaller black-and-white illustrations from pen drawings. (The illustrations include initials, either a.j.s or MS, to identify the artist of each drawing.) Satterlee also provided a description of the Woodwardia ferns.

The episode was written by Rebecca Perry Cutter and directed by TJ Scott. It was first broadcast in October 26, 2015 in FOX. Plot As part of their plan to get his mother back, Butch tells Theo Galavan that Cobblepot cut off his hand for thinking he betrayed him and offers to work for Galavan. Galavan initially declines, stating that his associates \\"have both hands\\". Tabitha agrees to let him join them but Barbara is skeptical, citing when Butch kidnapped her. Finally, Galavan lets Butch be part of his operation. Galavan also threatens to kill a congressman if he doesn't support him in the elections, which ends when the congressman agrees to his terms and his life is spared. Meanwhile, the strike force, led by Gordon, catch a thug and accuse him of being the arsonist who killed Officer Garrett in the previous episode. Bridgit is having a rough time after having killed the police officer. She lives with Selina, but continues to feel guilty. Selina proposes to get money so she can leave Gotham City and both of them steal money from a human trafficking slave-ring. During their escape, they're caught on camera, and Gordon recognizes Selina. On their way to the bus station, Bridgit is kidnapped by the Pike brothers. Selina plans on rescuing her but is found by Gordon. Selina gives the information to Gordon, but Gordon states he will take care of the situation. Bridgit is brought back to the Pike home where her brothers taunt her fear of fire by threatening her with firecrackers. Tired of their abuse, Bridgit kills them with a flamethrower. While looking for the whereabouts of Cobblepot's mother, Butch is discovered by Galavan and learns that he knows of his and Penguin's ruse. Galavan figures out that Oswald has a mental hold on Butch and tells Tabitha to try and beat it out of him. Selina reunites with Bridgit but realizes she's changed in her attitude and plans on taking down abusive people. Bridgit returns to the slave-ring where she burns the captors and frees the women. With a tip from Selina, Gordon, Barnes and the GCPD arrive at the slave-ring. Gordon tries to calm Bridgit, but she fights back. However, she accidentally catches fire while trying to defend herself. In an attempt to co-opt Bruce, Galavan proposes to help clean up the corruption in Wayne Enterprises. Butch escapes from the Galavans and tells Cobblepot his mother's whereabouts. Selina appears at Leslie and Gordon's apartment and is heartbroken when Gordon tells her Bridgit won't survive her injuries. Nygma reveals to Kringle during a visit that he accidentally killed her ex-boyfriend, Dougherty. When she tries to leave and tell someone, he holds her and tries to keep her from screaming, but he unknowingly strangles her and she dies in his arms, leaving him shouting and crying in grief. In an underground facility of a division of Wayne Enterprises, Bridgit, still alive, is brought to Indian Hill labs where scientists experiment on human beings. Reception Ratings The episode was watched by 4.32 million viewers. This was an increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.19 million viewers. This made Gotham the most watched program of the day in FOX, beating Minority Report. Critical reception \\"Rise of the Villains: By Fire\\" received positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 79% with an average score of 6.5 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Though season two continues to struggle with tonal consistency, 'By Fire' sets up a fun showdown between some of Gothams most explosive characters.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.4 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"'By Fire' may have been another one of this show's villain-as-a-kid origin tales, but it was utilized nicely right at the end to open up a whole new side of the series - that of the Indian Hill monster farm.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"The biggest problem plaguing 'By Fire,' and really Gotham as a whole, is that it wants to explore the story of Gordon‚Äôs potentially compromised morality with as much gravitas as possible while also insisting that the more comic and cartoonish tendencies are fine because hey, this is just a comic book show, right? It‚Äôs a flippancy that‚Äôs insulting to anyone who watches the show and tries to invest in these characters, and it‚Äôs a general lack of attention paid to storytelling that results in frustrating swings in tone.\\" References  External links   Gotham (season 2) episodes 2015 American television episodes ","title":"By Fire"},{"id":"48749270","text":"Maol √çosa, Earl of Strathearn (right) and possibly Maria herself (left).Holton (2017) pp. 196‚Äì197; Neville (1983a) p. 116; Brydall (1894‚Äì1895) pp. 350, 351 fig. 14.

Plot  This short documentary follows Abelardo Olgu√≠n Cuevas, a third-generation Mexican cockfighter struggling to hold on to his family's traditions in the face of a growing movement to ban the sport across the country. Cockfighting has been Abelardo's passion since he was five years old. Now, with children of his own, he hopes to pass on tradition, but he and his fellow cockfighters see the world changing before their eyes. The film explores Abelardo's day-to-day life in Ixmiquilpan, Central Mexico, from his farm, where he trains his roosters, to the cockfighting tournaments. A unique glimpse into the vibrant and controversial culture of cockfighting.

Huebner (eds.), The Timeliness of George Herbert Mead, University of Chicago Press, 2016, p. 326. is an analysis of the factors leading to the evolution of language in human ancestors, typically during the Homo erectus era. This theory is most commonly associated with the cognitive neuroscientist and neuroanthropologist Merlin Donald, who developed the idea in his 1991 book Origins of the Modern Mind as the fundamental pillar in his three-part model of the development of symbolic culture and symbolic cognition. Overview The mimetic theory of development was the central pillar in Donald's three-part model of symbolic cognition proposed in his 1991 book Origins of the Modern Mind. > Origins of the Modern Mind proposes a three-stage development of human > symbolic capacity through culture: Mimetic culture: The watershed adaptation > allowing humans to function as symbolic and cultural beings was a > revolutionary improvement in motor control, the \\"mimetic skill\\" required to > rehearse and refine the body's movements in a voluntary and systematic way, > to remember those rehearsals, and to reproduce them on command. Following > this development, Homo erectus assimilated and reconceptualized events to > create various prelinguistic symbolic traditions such as rituals, dance, and > craft.

Donald begins with the development of episodic memory in primates, and traces how the evolutionary lineage of the brain brought about next a mimetic culture, based on pantomiming and simplistic vocalizations to convey intentionality, and then a mythic culture, which used simplistic forms of story-sharing to form the basis of the first hominids trying to model their environment, its origins, and their place within it, and finally to a theoretic culture, which had the capability for higher orders of cognitive-processing, and whom eventually developed language. Donald's theory of the evolution of the human mind with mimesis at the core of things is very dependent on a lineage that is highly period-based, likely as a means to help explain some of the contradictory gaps in the archaeological record, where tool use, cultural artifacts, mastery of fire, and brain size (based on skulls that have been found) seem to either conflict, or have missing steps in their development. Donald sees this progression taking place in a very linear way, and his logic behind this makes sense. For example, the concept of mimetic minds makes intuitive sense- an episodic memory certainly had to be in place before an intentional communication system of any capacity could be implemented, but it also seems highly unlikely that hominids went straight from the ability to remember and mentally manipulate certain events to the ability to speak; after all, one would have little use for language- let alone an evolutionary reason to develop it- without first developing a concrete sense of personal intentionality, along with the capacity to communicate this intentional stance to others, and with the reciprocal action of understanding their intentional stance as well. Criticisms and addendums to the theory It seems unlikely that the development of the mind occurred in such linear periods as Donald describes them; new evidence that has emerged since the publication of Donald's book, primarily the discovery of mirror neurons, has laid the groundwork for a potentially more fluid, less periodic theory of the evolution of the mind. Mirror neurons are a class of cells that have been found in the brains of several species of monkey, as well as in humans. Small clusters of mirror neurons tend to fire when an individual performs a given intentional action; this, however, is not the unique part. What is unique to mirror neurons is that a few of them in a cluster will also fire when an individual watches a different individual performing an intentional action. In other words, these neurons are influencing your ability for social learning. Because the same neurons are firing both when you perform an action and when you watch someone else rehearse that same action, the mind has obtained a method by which it can link itself to conspecific minds in order to share knowledge, culture, and judge the intentional stance of a potential friend or foe. The existence of these neurons should likely trace their roots back closer to a common ancestor with modern primates, the only other species noted with mirror neurons, and some of the intentional and mimetic capabilities that Donald attributes to the evolution of the mimetic mind in Homo Erectus were likely around much earlier in some simplified form, perhaps as the foundation of the rigid social hierarchies that our primate cousins are known for. Indeed, evidence exists that perhaps monkeys are even better at some aspects of the social cognition game than humans are. Colin Camerer, a behavioral economist at the California Institute of Technology, has conducted studies on monkeys using strategic games, where the outcomes can be quantitatively assessed against results from game theory, an applied branch of mathematics and economics which dictates rational choices and optimal outcomes, such as Nash Equilibriums, in games of strategy between two or more opponents. Amazingly, when pairs of chimps and pairs of humans were pitted against each other in a strategic pattern matching game, the outcomes for pairs of chimps clustered much more closely to the Nash Equilibrium and other mathematically- efficient outcomes than the outcomes for pairs of humans did. Perhaps even more interesting is that when the researchers shifted the reward incentive more in favor of one party versus the other- and so also shifting where the efficient equilibrium points should fall- the chimps not only altered their behavior accordingly, they once again clustered more closely around the new mathematical equilibriums than human pairs did. Camerer posits that this is likely attributable to the importance of social hierarchy and role in chimpanzees, where the ability to strategize into a position of best outcome given the circumstance (or the chance to manipulate another chimpanzee's strategic mistake to maximize one's own gain) is an incredibly valuable skill. This seems to be a probable explanation for the unlikely capability of monkeys to have such a finely attuned social sense that their behavior can be described by formal mathematical equilibriums; unfortunately, it does not bode well for Donald's theory of a period of mimetic mind and culture development during the Erectus period of Homo lineage. Chimps in these experiments have shown signs of intentionality, communicativity, reference, modeling of social structure, reciprocal mimetic games, and conformity and coordination, all tenets of mimetic minds and mimetic cultures in Donald's model, but all certainly having roots in ancestry from before Donald's proposed mimetic period. Additionally, the chimpanzees must have at least a crude form of mental representations: the chimpanzees shifting to a new equilibrium when reward incentives were altered seems to undoubtedly indicate that they are aware of themselves and another chimp in a mutually-interactive environment, in which an abstract activity leads to a variable reward, a degree of strategy that requires at least some basic information to be held in the mind and manipulated. Furthermore, many of these capabilities formed the basis of the progression into unique-to-human features of the mind developing in Donald's model. For example, this mimetic behavior must be preceded first by an episodic memory capable of handling mental manipulations; the combination of this memory system with the acquisition and development of skills like intentionality and mimesis should then be sufficient with the proper pressures to allow for skills like tool-making, ritual dance, and pedagogy. And yet primates have evolved alongside us for millions of years without developing tools, dance, or any significant means of information transfer and teaching, despite certainly having an episodic memory, and presumably having some sort of social mirroring neurons that allowed them to develop such a complex social hierarchy, as well as display basic levels of intentionality, communicativity, and coordination. Thus, the divergence of cognitive capacities between humans and lower hominids may not be due so much to mimetic culture as it is due to some mutation that increased that plasticity in our brains around the time of Homo Erectus, perhaps in part related to the mastery of fire during this period, which would have allowed for cooking and the ability to ingest enough quality nutrition to give our brains the resources to make its final push into its modern stage of development. This increase in plasticity would certainly be a mutation or upgrade supported by natural selection; a brain that can learn faster, more efficiently, and calibrate itself more properly to the needs of body and mind in the environment provides an absolutely massive leg- up on the competition. The mirror neuron system would be a logical system to derive primary benefit from an increase in plasticity under the conditions proposed. If this adaptation were indeed a result of the mastery of fire and the additional nutrition and food security brought about by cooking, changes in communal relations would be a logical co-requisite development, as fire promised warmth and security, and the invention of cooking would have provided an easier way of feeding larger groups.

Started in June 2005, this webtoon manhwa was released on Daum. The print publication of the first volume of Timing was released on August 5, 2006. The webtoon has been adapted into a film of the same name. Synopsis Kang Full's Timing is set in an unidentified city that is under a vague threat; a high school student committed suicide for no apparent reason and children are generally scared. A group of people with supernatural powers appear on the scene to put an end to the silent threat. The concept has been compared to that of X-Men and Heroes and has a fairly American style to it. Timing features a student that can freeze time, a salaryman who has the ability to turn back time for ten seconds, a fast-food employee who can predict the next ten minutes, and a teacher whose dreams serve as premonitions for what is to come. Sara Lawi of Orient-Extr√™me described Timing as a \\"deliberately simplistic\\" thriller. Development Kang took suggestions from his readership to determine the direction of Timings story. Adaptations In 2010, production on an animated film adaptation for Timing started. The film was originally scheduled to be released in 2012, but it was shelved for sponsorship reasons. The animated film eventually premiered in October 2014, when it was shown at the 19th Busan International Film Festival. This adaptation of Timing is directed by Min Kyung-jo, produced by Hyoin Entertainment, and features the voices of Park Ji-yoon, Um Sang-hyun, Ryu Seung-gon, Yeo Min-jeong, Sim Gyu-hyuk and Sung Wan-kyung. Timing was also shown at the 17th Seoul International Cartoon and Animation Festival in May 2015, where it won the grand prize. The film was officially released in South Korea on December 10, 2015.

Early years (1848‚Äì80) Jean- Baptiste Darlan was born on 10 June 1848 in Podensac, Gironde, son of a sea captain. A distant cousin of his had been a sailor on the ship that killed Nelson during the Battle of Trafalgar. His grandfather was a master mariner. His father owned two ships that sailed between France and Mexico, and was mayor of Podensac. Darlan studied at the lyc√©e in Bordeaux, then obtained his law degree at the faculty of Paris. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he was a non-commissioned officer in the forces of Lot-et-Garonne. When his father died in 1872 Darlan had to sell the two ships, and with the proceeds bought the position of notary in Marmande. In 1877 he married Marie Marguerite Espagnac, daughter of a N√©rac doctor, who brought a substantial dowry. Darlan sold his practice as a notary and set up as an attorney in N√©rac. They had two children. H√©l√®ne married a ship's captain and Fran√ßois Darlan later became an admiral. Fran√ßois was born on 7 August 1881. Marie Marguerite died in 1885 at the age of 34. Political career (1880‚Äì98) In 1878 Darlan joined the Association from Propagation of Republican Ideas, and became a freemason. As a member of the Grand Lodge he progressed through the ranks to become V√©n√©rable in the lodge L'Auguste amiti√© in Condom. He became a friend of Armand Falli√®res and of Georges Leygues, who would many years later make his son chief of staff of the Ministry of Marine. In 1880 he became municipal councilor of N√©rac, and was mayor of N√©rac from 1880‚Äì82 and 1888‚Äì96. From 1886 to 1898 he was a member of the general council of the Lot-et-Garonne department. Darlan was elected deputy for Lot-et-Garonne in a by-election on 27 July 1890 by a landslide, and was easily reelected in the general election of 20 August 1893. On 29 April 1896 he was appointed Minister of Justice in the cabinet of Jules M√©line, and on 26 September 1896 was also appointed Minister of Religious Affairs. When he was in office there was growing public debate over the Dreyfus affair. Darlan was opposed to reviewing the trial of 1894. Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, vice-president of the Senate, became convinced that Dreyfus was innocent and came to see Darlan on 5 November 1896. Darlan said he could not support a premature investigation. On 30 November 1897 Darlan was challenged over the appointment of two magistrates, said to have been made for political reasons, and was censured by the Senate. He resigned the next day. He lost his seat in the general elections of 8‚Äì22 May 1898. Last years (1898‚Äì1912) Darlan was named percepteur-receveur in Paris in 1899. He died on 8 December 1912 in N√©rac, Lot-et-Garonne.

It was built by the Order of St. John between 1725 and 1726, on the site of an earlier tower, and its purpose was to communicate signals between Mdina and the rest of Malta. Today, the tower is in good condition, and it serves as a tourist information centre and for occasional cultural events. History Torre Mastra/de la Bandiera The Torre dello Standardo was built on site of a medieval tower called the Torre Mastra () or the Torre de la Bandiera (). The site is located near the Mdina Gate, the main entrance of the city. It was one of a series of towers located within the fortifications of Mdina. The tower, like many other medieval buildings in Mdina, had suffered significant damage during the 1693 Sicily earthquake.Instituto Portugu√ªes do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (1999), \\"Struggle for synthesis: a obra de arte total nos s√©culos XVII e XVIII, Volume 1\\", IPPAR, p. 142. The tower was eventually demolished in March 1725 to be replaced by the Torre dello Standardo. Torre dello Standardo/Stendardo Torre dello Standardo started to be built in 1725 to designs of the French military engineer Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, as part of a project to rebuild the entrance to Mdina in the Baroque style during the magistracy of Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena. It was completed in July 1726. During the Maltese uprising of 1798 against the French occupation of Malta, rebels hosted Maltese, Neapolitan and Portuguese flags on the tower when the Portuguese Navy came to aid the insurgents. It remained in use as a signal tower until the early periods of the British rule. Use Purposely built Both the Torre Mastra and the Torre dello Standardo served the same purpose to relay signals from Mdina to the rest of the island of Malta. A fire would be ignited to send a warning to the inhabitants and nearby towers in case of an invasion, while it was also armed with canons which fired every evening before the city closes the entrances. Adaptive reuse In the 19th century, when the nearby Palazzo Vilhena was used as a sanatorium by the British military, the tower was used to house the porter and other servants of the sanatorium. By 1888, it was being used as a Telegraph Office. The tower eventually became a police station, until the police moved across the street to the former Maltacom Building in 2002. Since March 2011Mdina council takes over tower, garden and shelters. 30 March 2011. Times of Malta. Retrieved 22 June 2016. the tower has been a tourist information centre. Other The tower, along with the rear of the Mdina Gate, was depicted on the Lm5 banknote that was in circulation between 1989 and 2007. Architecture The tower's domed cylindrical stair-hood The Torre dello Standardo's design is similar to the coastal watchtowers such as the De Redin towers that the Order built in Malta during the 17th century. It has the same basic layout, with two floors and a scarped base. However, this tower is of finer construction than the coastal towers, having decorative Baroque elements such as mouldings, as well as escutcheons containing the coats of arms of De Vilhena and the city of Mdina. The sculptural details are the work of Francesco Zahra. The tower has a cylindrical stair-hood with a dome, and this feature is similar to that found at Palazzo Stagno and the now-demolished Gourgion Tower. Heritage The tower is a heritage and cultural building. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

History  During the mid-Edo period, many potters from the Shigaraki area traveled the country to sell their wares or to simply find employment. During the An'ei period (1772‚Äì1784), the headman of Hakoda village in Hitachi Province, Kuno Hanzaemon Michinobe, invited a potter from Shiragaki named Ch≈çzaemon to build a kiln in his village. The new kiln produced plain utilitarian pots and vessels, but soon received the patronage and protection of the daimy≈ç of Kasama Domain, who controlled Hakoda village. This marked the beginning of the Kasama-yaki pottery style. During the Meiji period, mass production techniques were introduced and Kasama grew to rival Mashiko as a leading pottery center for the Kant≈ç region. After World War II, changes in local attitudes opened the Kasama-ware industry beyond its traditional restrictions on form and style, and also opened the door to any craftsmen, regardless of previous training or background. A similar transformation also occurred in nearby Mashiko. At present, more than 300 potters are active in Kasama, using various types of clay and glazes with no resemblance to the original Kasama-ware works of the Edo period.

A Benedictine monastery became attached to the church by the 1100s, and the church was expanded, creating altars dedicated to the Saints Fortunato (6th century saint), Cassiano, and John the Baptist, consecrated by Pope Innocent III in 1198. The church was acquired by the Franciscan order by 1292, and led to the construction of the church building we see today. Only the lower portion of the facade was faced in polished stone; the rest remains in bare brick. The facade was designed in the first half of the 15th century by Giovanni di Santuccio of Firenzuola. Built from 1295 to 1460, the church has a Gothic central portal (1415‚Äì1458), with richly decorated spiraling pilasters, leafy and animal details, and depictions a saints and apostles. The sculptures flanking the portal are attributed to followers of Jacopo della Quercia. The portal is reached through elaborate levels of stairs. The interior has a nave divided from the aisles by compound piers. The vault displays gothic tracery, and the apse has tall lancet windows.Visitodi website, tourism website of the Region of Umbria. The interior has fragments of frescoes by Masolino da Panicale, depicting a Madonna and child with Angels (1432). In the Cappella Gregoriana is an altarpiece (1618) by Andrea Polinori. The chapel's frescoes (1400) were completed by Niccol√≤ di Vannuccio. The chapel also has wooden choir stalls with intaglio (1590) by Antonio Maffei (1590). The Cappella dell'Assunta arising from the left nave was frescoed by Andrea Polinori.Medioevo In Umbria website, entry on church.

Whether bacteria might play a role in the gut-brain axis is under research. However, as of 2018, there is a paucity of randomized controlled trials testing the effects of live, ingested bacterial strains on clear mental health outcomes, and those that have been done provide inconclusive results when viewed in aggregate.  Types  Fructans In experimental probiotic psychobiotics, the bacteria most commonly used are gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus families, as these do not contain lipopolysaccharide chains, reducing the likelihood of an immunological response. Prebiotics are substances, such as fructans and oligosaccharides, that induce the growth or activity of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria on being fermented in the gut. Multiple bacterial species contained in a single probiotic broth is known as a polybiotic.  Research  The field of psychobiotics in humans is nascent, though there have been many studies in rodents demonstrating increased cognitive functioning, decreased anxiety, and decreases in stress related pathology. However, the human literature has yet to catch up with most rodent experiments, and has so far failed to produce a high number of well designed, randomized trials. Several recent reviews have highlighted the fact that there is a need for more diverse human studies, particularly because those that exist are often hard to compare and have contradictory outcomes.

In these experiments, light incident on the photodetector generates photoelectrons and a counter registers electrical pulses generating a statistical distribution of photon counts. Low intensity disparate light sources can be differentiated by the corresponding statistical distributions produced in the detection process. Three regimes of statistical distributions can be obtained depending on the properties of the light source: Poissonian, super-Poissonian, and sub-Poissonian. The regimes are defined by the relationship between the variance and average number of photon counts for the corresponding distribution. Both Poissonian and super-Poissonian light can be described by a semi-classical theory in which the light source is modeled as an electromagnetic wave and the atom is modeled according to quantum mechanics. In contrast, sub-Poissonian light requires the quantization of the electromagnetic field for a proper description and thus is a direct measure of the particle nature of light. Poissonian Light In classical electromagnetic theory, an ideal source of light with constant intensity can be modeled by a spatially and temporally coherent electromagnetic wave of a single frequency. Such a light source can be modeled by,M. Fox, Quantum Optics: An Introduction, Oxford University Press, New York, 2006 :E(x,t) = E_{0} \\\\sin(kx - \\\\omega t + \\\\phi) where \\\\omega is the frequency of the field and \\\\phi is a time independent phase shift. The analogue in quantum mechanics is the coherent state : |\\\\alpha \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{{\\\\alpha}^n}{\\\\sqrt{n!}} e^{\\\\frac{{-\\\\left\\\\vert{\\\\alpha}\\\\right\\\\vert}^{2}}{2}} |n \\\\rangle By projecting the coherent state onto the Fock state |n\\\\rangle, we can find the probability P_{n} of finding n photons using the Born rule, which gives : P_{n} = \\\\frac{n!} e^{{-\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\alpha \\\\right\\\\vert}^2} = \\\\frac{{\\\\langle n \\\\rangle}^{n}}{n!} e^{-\\\\langle n \\\\rangle} The above result is a Poissonian distribution with {\\\\Delta n}^2 = \\\\langle n \\\\rangle which is a distinct feature of the coherent state. Super-Poissonian Light  Light that is governed by super-Poissonian statistics exhibits a statistical distribution with variance {\\\\Delta n}^2 > \\\\langle n \\\\rangle . An example of light that exhibits super-Poissonian statistics is thermal light. The intensity of thermal light fluctuates randomly and the fluctuations give rise to super- Poissonian statistics, as shown below by calculating the distribution of the intensity fluctuations.I. Deutsch, Quantum Optics Course Fall 2015, http://info.phys.unm.edu/~ideutsch/Classes/Phys566F15/Lectures/Phys566_Lect02.pdf. Retrieved 9 December 2015 Using the intensity distribution together with Mandel's formula which describes the probability of the number of photon counts registered by a photodetector, the statistical distribution of photons in thermal light can be obtained. Thermal light can be modeled as a collection of N harmonic oscillators. Suppose the j-th oscillator emits an electromagnetic field E_{j}(t) = E_{0}e^{-i\\\\omega t}e^{i\\\\phi_{j}(t)} with phase \\\\phi_{j}(t) . Using the theory of superposition of fields, the total field produced by the N oscillators is : E(t) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} E_{j}(t) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} E_{0}e^{-i\\\\omega t}e^{i\\\\phi_{j}(t)} After pulling out all the variables that are independent of the summation index j, a random complex amplitude can be defined by : \\\\beta (t) = \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i\\\\phi_{j}(t)} = b(t) e^{i\\\\Phi (t)} where \\\\beta (t) was rewritten in terms of its magnitude b(t) = \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta \\\\right\\\\vert and its phase e^{i\\\\Phi (t)} . Because the oscillators are uncorrelated, the phase of the superposed field will be random. Therefore, the complex amplitude \\\\beta (t) is a stochastic variable. It represents the sum of the uncorrelated phases of the oscillators which models the intensity fluctuations in thermal light. On the complex plane, it represents a two dimensional random walker with N representing the steps taken. For large N a random walker has a Gaussian probability distribution. Thus, the joint probability distribution for the real and imaginary parts of the complex random variable \\\\beta (t) can be represented as, : p(\\\\beta (t)) = \\\\left [ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^{2}}} e^{\\\\frac{-{Re(\\\\beta(t))}^2}{2\\\\sigma^{2}}} \\\\right ] \\\\left [ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^{2}}} e^{\\\\frac{-{Im(\\\\beta(t))}^2}{2\\\\sigma^{2}}} \\\\right ] : = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^{2}} e^{\\\\frac{-\\\\left ( {Re(\\\\beta(t))}^2+{Im(\\\\beta(t))}^2 \\\\right )}{2\\\\sigma^{2}}} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma^{2}} e^{\\\\frac{- {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 }{2\\\\sigma^{2}}} After N steps, the expectation value of the radius squared is \\\\langle {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 \\\\rangle = 2 \\\\sigma^{2} = N . The expectation value \\\\langle\\\\left \\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right \\\\vert \\\\rangle= 0 which can be thought of as all directions being equally likely. Rewriting the probability distribution in terms of N results in : p(\\\\beta (t)) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi N} e^{\\\\frac{- {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 }{N}} With the probability distribution above, we can now find the average intensity of the field (where several constants have been omitted for clarity) : \\\\langle I(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle E^{*}(t)E(t)\\\\rangle : = {E_{0}}^{2}{\\\\langle \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2\\\\rangle= N{E_{0}}^{2} The instantaneous intensity of the field I(t) is given by : I(t) = E^{*}(t)E(t) = E_{0}^2 { \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 Because the electric field and thus the intensity are dependent on the stochastic complex variable \\\\beta(t) . The probability of obtaining an intensity in between I and I + dI is : p(I(t))dI = p(I(\\\\beta(t)))d^2\\\\beta where d^2\\\\beta is the infinitesimal element on the complex plane. This infinitesimal element can be rewritten as : d^2\\\\beta = 2\\\\pi \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert d\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert The above intensity distribution can now be written as : p(I(t)) = p(\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert) 2\\\\pi \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{dI}{d\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert} \\\\right )}^{-1} : = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi N} e^{\\\\frac{- {\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 }{N}} 2\\\\pi \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert {\\\\left ( 2E_{0}^{2} \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta (t) \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\right )}^{-1} : = \\\\frac{1}{N E_{0}^{2}} e^{\\\\frac{- E_{0}^{2}{\\\\left\\\\vert \\\\beta(t) \\\\right\\\\vert}^2 }{N E_{0}^{2}}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\langle I(t) \\\\rangle} e^{\\\\frac{- I(t) }{\\\\langle I(t) \\\\rangle}} This last expression represents the intensity distribution for thermal light. The last step in showing thermal light satisfies the variance condition for super- Poisson statistics is to use Mandel's formula. The formula describes the probability of observing n photon counts and is given by : P(n) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{{\\\\left ( \\\\epsilon I \\\\right )}^{n}}{n!} e^{-\\\\epsilon I} P(I) dI The factor \\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{\\\\eta}{h u} where \\\\eta is the quantum efficiency describes the efficiency of the photon counter. A perfect detector would have \\\\eta = 1 . I is the intensity incident on an area A of the photodetector and is given byJ. W. Goodman, Statistical Optics, Wiley, New York, (1985) 238-256, 466-468 :Comparison of the Poisson and Bose-Einstein distributions. The Poisson distribution is characteristic of coherent light while the Bose-Einstein distribution is characteristic of thermal light. Both distribution have the same expectation value \\\\langle n \\\\rangle = 6. I = \\\\iint\\\\limits_A \\\\int_{t}^{t+\\\\tau} \\\\, I(x,y,t') dt'\\\\,dx\\\\,dy On substituting the intensity probability distribution of thermal light for P(I), Mandel's formula becomes : P(n) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{{\\\\left ( \\\\epsilon I \\\\right )}^{n}}{n!} e^{-\\\\epsilon I} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{- I }{\\\\langle I \\\\rangle}}}{\\\\langle I \\\\rangle} dI = \\\\frac{{\\\\epsilon}^n}{n! \\\\langle I \\\\rangle} \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} { I }^{n} e^{-\\\\left ( \\\\epsilon + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\langle I \\\\rangle}\\\\right )I} dI Using the following formula to evaluate the integral \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} x^{n} e^{-ax} dx = \\\\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}} \\\\quad \\\\left ( n = 0,1,2,.. a>0\\\\right) The probability distribution for n photon counts from a thermal light source is : P(n) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\left ( \\\\langle n \\\\rangle +1 \\\\right )} {\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\langle n \\\\rangle}{ \\\\langle n \\\\rangle +1}\\\\right )}^n where \\\\langle n \\\\rangle = \\\\epsilon I is the average number of counts. This last distribution is known as the Bose-Einstein distribution. The variance of the distribution can be shown to be : {\\\\Delta n }^2 = \\\\langle n \\\\rangle + {\\\\langle n \\\\rangle}^2 In contrast with the Poisson distribution for a coherent light source, the Bose- Einstein distribution has {\\\\Delta n}^2 > \\\\langle n \\\\rangle characteristic of thermal light.

The photodetectors (black elements) send electrical signals to the correlator where the intensity correlation is measured. Light that is governed by sub-Poisson statistics cannot be described by classical electromagnetic theory and is defined by {\\\\Delta n}^2 < \\\\langle n \\\\rangle . The advent of ultrafast photodetectors has made it possible to measure the sub-Poissonian nature of light. An example of light exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics is squeezed light. Recently researchers have shown that sub-Poissonian light can be induced in a quantum dot exhibiting resonance fluorescence. A technique used to measure the sub- Poissonian structure of light is a homodyne intensity correlation scheme. In this scheme a local oscillator and signal field are superimposed via a beam splitter. The superimposed light is then split by another beam splitter and each signal is recorded by individual photodetectors connected to correlator from which the intensity correlation can be measured. Evidence of the sub- Poissonian nature of light is shown by obtaining a negative intensity correlation as was shown in.

They briefly operated under the name H.M. Subjects and recorded a version of the Pretty Things's \\"Don't Bring Me Down,\\" which while in the process of becoming a local hit, became embroiled in a controversy involving Morton Downey, Jr., then a disc jockey at Miami's WFUN and later of talk show fame. The song was criticized for its apparently sexually suggestive lyric and the contention that Downey allegedly took payola for the song, an allegation which was never proven. The band went on to record another single, once again as the Montells, featuring an A-side for which they are remembered, \\"You Can't Make Me.\\" They broke up in 1967, but reunited for a performance in 2008. History Origins The Montells began as the Impalas in 1963 and were made of up students from Southwest Senior High School in Miami Florida. In the 1960s, the school served as a major breeding ground for Miami's thriving rock scene and hosted a number of fellow garage bands, such as Evil and the Shaggs, and had earlier been the Alma Mater of Charlie McCoy, who had by then become one of the most in-demand session musicians in Nashville, playing with a number of famous artists including Bob Dylan. The lineup of the Impalas consisted of John Weatherford on rhythm guitar, George Walden on lead guitar, George Hall on bass, and Jeff Allen on drums. They would occasionally bring in Gene Murray as a part time vocalist. Walden and Weatherford had taken classical guitar lessons and Hall had played bass in the school band. The two would get to together and hold rehearsals in the afternoon. Jeff Allen lived in the neighborhood and asked them if he could join. They told him that he could under the condition that he by a drum kit. Allen purchased a drum kit that had the logo of another band \\"the Impalas\\" printed on it, so they just decided to use the name Impalas. The band played for about a year as a largely instrumental surf group, often playing at parties. Eventually the group was threatened with a lawsuit over their use of the name \\"the Impalas,\\" so they re-christened themselves as the Montells. According to Carter Ragsdale, \\"...on the way to get the bass drum painted we passed a dance studio called the House of Montell. We thought that would be a good name so we became the Montells.\\" In 1964 the Montells enlisted Carter Ragsdale to be their lead singer, who was recommended by Gene Murray who was departing. The band would increasingly tailor their sound to fit the kind of hard rocking, blues-based approach of British bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals.\\" Drummer Jeff Allen, later to play with Evil, would make occasional trips with this family to England and when there would check out many of the hottest bands such as the Fairies, Downliners Sect, and the Pretty Things, and upon his returns would bring back records and share his observations with fellow bandmates. H. M. Subjects and controversy In May 1965, the Montells went to Dukoff Recording Studios in Miami to record several songs, amongst which \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" previously recorded by British group the Pretty Things, would be featured on their first single released on Blue Saint Records. Upon the release of this record and in live performances around this time, the Montells temporarily operated under the name H.M. Subjects (short for \\"Her Majesty's Subjects\\"), at the request of a disc jockey at the local radio station, WFUN, who wanted them to adopt a name that would appeal to fans of British Invasion groups such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The deejay was none other than Morton Downey Jr., later of talk show fame, who was known in Miami at the time as \\"'Doc' Downey\\" (or sometimes \\"the Liverpool Loudmouth\\"), and was a transplant who had originally worked at WONE in Dayton Ohio, and later at KDEO in San Diego, and had been involved in the music industry, at times as a musical act himself, or in production and A&R;, such as with his brief stint at Magic Lamp Records in Los Angeles, where he had been involved with surf rock records by the Chantays and the Surfaris. At the time it was not uncommon for deejays to host dances, and guitarist George Walden and drummer Jeff Allen would frequently visit WFUN and got to know the staff there. The lyrics of H.M. Subjects' version of the song were somewhat improvised by vocalist Ragsdale and contained sexually suggestive lines such as \\"and when I laid her on the ground.\\" After hearing an acetate of \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" the opportunistic Downey quickly realized the potential to create a publicity scandal. He became involved with the release of the record and the band's promotion. The record became a local hit climbing up the Miami charts to #5. Just as soon as the record was ascending to the top of charts, it became engulfed in controversy, as parents objected to the song's sexual connotations, declaring it a \\"dirty record\\" and tried to have it banned. A censored version was released with the word \\"laid\\" replaced by a tone-generated beep, but it failed to quell the controversy, perhaps making the negative reaction even worse by inadvertently drawing even more attention to the suggestiveness of the lyric, especially when played on the radio, where listeners could complete the ad lib for themselves, sometimes in ceremonious fashion. Some have even speculated that the censor beeps were inserted by Downey himself. While Downey succeeded in creating the scandal he craved, he became the center of another, but less amenable, controversy. It was reported that he had a financial interest in all of the records he had played at WFUN, receiving a one cent proceed from every disc sold, and the H.M. Subjects' record came under the lion's share of the scrutiny. WFUN conducted an investigation into the allegations, but could not come up with sufficient evidence, so Downey returned to his Monday slot. Downey, nonetheless, became involved this time in a scandal involving an acrimonious situation involving the top deejay at rival station WQAM. WFUN was now concerned that their F.C.C. license might revoked. To placate the stations' concerns and avoid termination, Downey suspended sale of the H.M. Subjects' record, effectively letting it die in the charts. However, the scandal involving his actions towards the deejay at WQAM resulted in Downey's eventual firing at WFUN. According to music writer Jeff Lemlich: ::If there were any real losers in this battle royale, no doubt it was our boys from Southwest High. First, the Montells were deprived of a number one hit when copies of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" were left to waste away in the warehouse. Their planned second release through Downey, Van Morrison's \\"Gloria\\" was also put on hold. Continued recording and activity as the Montells The band returned to using their former name, the Montells, and remained a popular local act, continuing to play dances and armories and enjoyed a regional following, traveling to Gainesville to play at the University of Florida, playing in venues such as a club in Winter Haven owned by Gram Parsons' father and Daytona's Surf Club. In 1965, Danny Murphy replaced George Hall on bass and would also contribute lead and backing vocals as well as occasional guitar to the band's arrangements. In 1966 Don Ricketts, who had played in fellow Miami band the Modds would briefly join the group as a second bass player to provide additional support when Murphy was on guitar. The band went into the studio to record what has become perhaps their best known song, \\"You Can't Make Me,\\" backed with an Otis Blackwell penned chestnut, \\"Daddy Rolling Stone,\\" previously covered by the Who and released on the Themes label in May 1966. That year drummer Jeff Allen left to join Evil and was replaced by Ted Napoleon.\\" In 1967 lead singer Carter Ragsdale was drafted into the army during the Vietnam War. Former bassist George Hall also served time in Vietnam, as well as John Mascaro of fellow Miami band the Modds. The Montells broke up in 1967. Later developments Carter Ragsdale and Steve Chase briefly started a group named Carter's Pills with Ragsdale on vocals, Chase on guitar, and Billy Demoya on organ, playing at venues such as the Armory and the Place in North Miami. Later Ragsdale would follow his father's footsteps as a horse trainer. The Montells re-united briefly with three of their 1960s members, Ragsdale, Weatherford, and Hall, augmented by Johnny Dalton, previously of Evil, on guitar and for Dewey Bond, formerly in the Modds, on drums for a Miami appearance at Geezerpalooza in 2008. In the intervening years following their breakup, the Montells' work has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts. In 2002, Corduroy Records released a split album featuring the work of both the Montells and Evil entitled, The Montells/ Evil. The song, \\"You Can't Make Me\\" is included on the Back from the Grave, Volume 2 (CD) CD and the Back from the Grave, Volume 3 (LP) LP, put out by Crypt Records. ‚Äì CD Liner notes and cover artwork. ‚Äì LP Liner notes and cover artwork.

Saffron crocus cultivation has long centered on a broad belt of Eurasia bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the southwest to India and China in the northeast. The major producers of antiquity‚ÄîIran, Spain, India, and Greece‚Äîcontinue to dominate the world trade. The cultivation of saffron in the Americas was begun by members of the Schwenkfelder Church in Pennsylvania. In recent decades cultivation has spread to New Zealand, Tasmania, and California. Iran has accounted for around 90‚Äì93 percent of recent annual world production and thereby dominates the export market on a by-quantity basis.  Modern trade  Sale of saffron and other spices in Iran  Producers  Almost all saffron grows in a belt bounded by the Mediterranean in the west and mountainous Kashmir in the east. All other continents except Antarctica produce smaller amounts. In 1991, Some of whole threads and powder are gleaned yearly, of which is top-grade \\"coupe\\" saffron. Iran is by far the world's most important producer: in 2005 it grossed some of dry threads, or 93.7 percent of the year's global total mass; much of the Iranian crop was bound for export. Northeastern Khorasan Province, which in 2004 was divided in three, grows 95 percent of Iranian saffron: the hinterlands of Birjand, Ghayen, Ferdows in South Khorasan Province, along with areas abutting Gonabad and Torbat-e Heydarieh in Razavi Khorasan Province, are its key cropping areas.

In decreasing order, Iran, Greece, Morocco, the Kashmir region in India, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Italy dominate the world harvest. Afghanistan has resumed cultivation in recent years; in restive Kashmir it has waned. Despite numerous cultivation efforts in such countries as Austria, England, Germany, and Switzerland, only select locales continue the harvest in northern and central Europe. Among these is the small Swiss village of Mund, in the Valais canton, whose annual saffron output amounts to several kilograms. Microscale cultivation occurs in Tasmania, China, Egypt, France, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey (especially Safranbolu), California, and Central Africa. According to figures of 2014, India produced per annum about 15,000 kilograms.

The Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir have the All J&K; Saffron Growers & Dealers Association which is run in order to promote fair trade and the rights of saffron farmers, and to promote trade of the spice.Homepage published by SGDA Saffron City Pampore [Retrieved 2015-12-08]  Price   Factors determining costs  The high cost of saffron is due to the difficulty of manually extracting large numbers of minute stigmas, which are the only part of the crocus with the desired aroma and flavour. An exorbitant number of flowers need to be processed in order to yield marketable amounts of saffron. Obtaining of dry saffron requires the harvesting of some 50,000 flowers, the equivalent of an association football pitch's area of cultivation, or roughly . By another estimate some 75,000 flowers are needed to produce one pound of dry saffron. This too depends on the typical stigma size of each saffron cultivar. Another complication arises in the flowers' simultaneous and transient blooming. Since so many crocus flowers are needed to yield even derisory quantities of dry saffron, the harvest can be a frenetic affair entailing about forty hours of intense labour. In Kashmir, the thousands of growers must work continuously in relays over the span of one or two weeks throughout both day and night. Once extracted, the stigmas must be dried quickly, lest decomposition or mould ruin the batch's marketability. The traditional method of drying involves spreading the fresh stigmas over screens of fine mesh, which are then baked over hot coals or wood or in oven-heated rooms where temperatures reach for 10‚Äì12 hours. Afterwards the dried spice is preferably sealed in airtight glass containers.  Actual prices  Per gram, prices range upward to $65, according to a year 2015 evaluation, ¬£5.20 (La Mancha), according to an evaluation made during year 2014, and ‚Ç¨20, according to a year 2011 evaluation. Bulk quantities of lower-grade saffron can reach upwards of 500 per pound; retail costs for small amounts may exceed ten times that rate. In Western countries the average retail price is approximately US$1,000 per pound. Prices vary widely elsewhere, but on average tend to be lower. The high price is somewhat offset by the small quantities needed in kitchens: a few grams at most in medicinal use and a few strands, at most, in culinary applications; there are between 70,000 and 200,000 strands in a pound. A price set during 2014 for Saffron grown within England was ¬£15 for 0.2. grams, this being sold at Fortnum & Mason, and a gram priced at a value with a maximum of ¬£75. Saffron is somewhat renowned for sometimes costing more per weight than gold.  Buyers  Experienced saffron buyers often have rules of thumb when deliberating on their purchases. They may look for threads exhibiting a vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, and elasticity. They reject threads displaying the telltale dull brick-red colouring‚Äîindicative of old stock‚Äîand broken-off debris collected at the container's bottom, indicative of age- related brittle dryness. Such aged samples are most likely encountered around the main June harvest season, when retailers attempt to clear out the previous season's old inventory and make room for the new season's crop. Buyers recommend that only the current season's threads be used. Reputable saffron wholesalers and retailers will indicate the year of harvest or the two years that bracket the harvest date; a late 2002 harvest would thus be shown as \\"2002/2003\\". For the entire of 2013, the Guruvayur temple of India, known as particularly affluent, had an agreement with Jammu & Kashmir Agro Industries Development Corporation for the routine purchasing of an amount equal to 10 kg a month.

They competed in the 2nd Division of the Amateur Soccer Association of WA, and stayed in the amateur ranks until the 1979 season, at which point they joined the 4th Division of the State League. They won the premiership and championship at the first attempt, and were promoted to the 3rd Division for the 1980 season. In 1982 their home ground moved to the Wanneroo Showgrounds. In 1983 they were runners-up and champions, gaining promotion to the 2nd division for the following year, assisted by their player/coach, ex- Southampton star John Sydenham. They stayed in the 2nd or 3rd Divisions for the next 20 years. In 1986, the club moved to the Kingsway Sporting Complex in Landsdale (now Madeley).

Background Molecules made up of elements with multiple isotopes can vary in their isotopic composition, these different mass molecules are called isotopologues. Isotopologues such as 12C18O17O, contain multiple heavy isotopes of oxygen substituting for the more common 16O, and are termed multiply-substituted isotopologues. The multiply-substituted isotopologue 13C18O16O contains a bond between two of these heavier isotopes (13C and 18O), which is a \\"clumped\\" isotope bond. The abundance of masses for a given molecule (e.g. CO2) can be predicted using the relative abundance of isotopes of its constituent atoms (13C/12C, 18O/16O and 17O/16O). The relative abundance of each isotopologue (e.g. mass-47 CO2) is proportional to the relative abundance of each isotopic species. : This predicted abundance assumes a non-biased stochastic distribution of isotopes, natural materials tend to deviate from these stochastic values, the study of which forms the basis of clumped isotope geochemistry. When a heavier isotope substitutes for a lighter isotope (e.g., 18O for 16O), the chemical bond's vibration will be slower, lowering its zero-point energy.Urey, H.C., 1947. The thermodynamic properties of isotopic substances. J. Chem. Soc. London 1947, 561‚Äì581.Bigeleisen, J., Mayer, M.G., 1947. Calculation of equilibrium constants for isotopic exchange reactions. J. Chem. Phys. 15, 261‚Äì267. In other words, thermodynamic stability is related to the isotopic composition of the molecule. 12C16O32‚àí (‚âà98.2%), 13C16O32‚àí (‚âà1.1%), 12C18O16O22‚àí (‚âà0.6%) and 12C17O16O22‚àí (‚âà0.11%) are the most abundant isotopologues (‚âà99%) for the carbonate ions, controlling the bulk Œ¥13C, Œ¥17O and Œ¥18O values in natural carbonate minerals. Each of these isopotologes has different thermodynamic stability. For a carbonate crystal at thermodynamic equilibrium, the relative abundances of the carbonate ion isotopologues is controlled by reactions such as: The equilibrium constants for this reactions are temperature-dependent, with a trend that heavy isotopes tend to \\"clump\\" with each other (increasing the proportions of multiply substituted isotopologues) as temperature decreases.Wang, Z., Schauble, E.A., Eiler, J.M., 2004. Equilibrium thermodynamics of multiply substituted isotopologues of molecular gases. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 68, 4779‚Äì4797. Reaction 1 will be driven to the right with decreasing temperature, to the left with increasing temperature. Therefore, the equilibrium constant for this reaction can be used as an paleotemperature indicator, as long as the temperature dependence of this reaction and the relative abundances of the carbonate ion isotopologues are known. Differences from the conventional Œ¥18O analysis In conventional Œ¥18O analysis, both the Œ¥18O values in carbonates and water are needed to estimate paleoclimate. However, for many times and places, the Œ¥18O in water can only be inferred, and also the 16O/18O ratio between carbonate and water may vary with the change in temperature.Chappell, J., Shackleton, N.J., 1986. Oxygen isotopes and sea level. Nature 324, 137‚Äì140.C. Waelbroeck, L. Labeyrie, E. Michel, et al., (2002) Sea-level and deep water temperature changes derived from benthic foraminifera isotopic records. Quaternary Science Reviews. 21: 295-305 Therefore, the accuracy of the thermometer may be compromised. Whereas for the carbonate clumped-isotope thermometer, the equilibrium is independent of the isotope compositions of waters from which carbonates grew. Therefore, the only information needed is the abundance of bonds between rare, heavy isotopes within the carbonate mineral. Methods # Extract from carbonates by reaction with anhydrous phosphoric acid.McCrea, J.M., 1950. On the isotopic chemistry of carbonates and a paleotemperature scale. J. Chem. Phys. 18, 849‚Äì857.Swart, P.K., Burns, S.J., Leder, J.J., 1991.

(precision need to be as high as ‚âà10‚àí5, for that isotope signals of interest are often less than ‚âà10‚àí3)  Applications   Paleoenvironment  Clumped isotopes analyses have traditionally been used in lieu of conventional Œ¥18O analyses when the Œ¥18O of seawater or source water is poorly constrained. While conventional Œ¥18O analysis solves for temperature as a function of both carbonate and water Œ¥18O, clumped isotope analyses can provide temperature estimates that are independent of the source water Œ¥18O. Œî47-derived temperature can then be used in conjunction with carbonate Œ¥18O to reconstruct Œ¥18O of the source water, thus providing information on the water with which the carbonate was equilibrated. Clumped isotope analyses thus allow for estimates of two key environmental variables: temperature and water Œ¥18O. These variables are especially useful for reconstructing past climates, as they can provide information on a wide range of environmental properties. For example, temperature variability can imply changes in solar irradiance, greenhouse gas concentration, or albedo, while changes in water Œ¥18O can be used to estimate changes in ice volume, sea level, or rainfall intensity and location. Studies have used temperatures derived from clumped isotopes for varied and numerous paleoclimate applications ‚Äî to constrain Œ¥18O of past seawater, pinpoint the timing of icehouse-hothouse transitions, track changes in ice volume through an ice age, and to reconstruct temperature changes in ancient lake basins.  Paleoaltimetry  Clumped isotope analyses have recently been used to constrain the paleoaltitude or uplift history of a region. Air temperature decreases systematically with altitude throughout the troposphere (see lapse rate). Due to the close coupling between lake water temperature and air temperature, there is a similar decrease in lake water temperature as altitude increases. Thus, variation in water temperature implied by Œî47 could indicate changes in lake altitude, driven by tectonic uplift or subsidence. Two recent studies derive the timing of the uplift of the Andes Mountains and the Altiplano Plateau, citing sharp decreases in Œî47-derived temperatures as evidence of rapid tectonic uplift.  Atmospheric Science  Measurements of Œî47 can be used to constrain natural and synthetic sources of atmospheric CO2, (e.g. respiration and combustion), as each of these processes are associated with different average Œî47 temperatures of formation.  Paleobiology  Measurements of Œî47 can be used to better understand the physiology of extinct organisms, and to place constraints on the early development of endothermy, the process by which organisms regulate their internal body temperatures. Prior to the development of clumped isotope analysis, there was no straightforward way to estimate either the body temperature or body water Œ¥18O of extinct animals. Eagle et al., 2010 measure Œî47 in bioapatite from a modern Indian elephant, white rhinoceros, Nile crocodile and American alligator. These animals were chosen as they span a wide range in internal body temperatures, allowing for the creation of a mathematical framework relating Œî47 of bioapatite and internal body temperature. This relationship has been applied to analyses of fossil teeth, in order to predict the body temperatures of a woolly mammoth and a sauropod dinosaur. The latest Œî47 temperature calibration for (bio)apatite of L√∂ffler et al. 2019 covers a wide temperature range of 1 to 80 ¬∞C and was applied to a fossil Megalodon shark tooth for calculating seawater temperatures and Œ¥18O values.  Petrology and metamorphic alteration  A key premise of most clumped isotope analyses is that samples have retained their primary isotopic signatures. However, isotopic resetting or alteration, resulting from elevated temperature, can provide a different type of information about past climates. For example, when carbonate is isotopically reset by high temperatures, measurements of Œî47 can provide information about the duration and extent of metamorphic alteration. In one such study, Œî47 from late Neoproterozoic Doushantou cap carbonate is used to assess the temperature evolution of the lower crust in southern China.  Cosmochemistry  Primitive meteorites have been studied using measurements of Œî47. These analyses also assume that the primary isotopic signature of the sample has been lost. In this case, measurements of Œî47 instead provide information on the high-temperature event that isotopically reset the sample. Existing Œî47 analyses on primitive meteorites have been used to infer the duration and temperature of aqueous alteration events, as well as to estimate the isotopic composition of the alteration fluid.  Ore Deposits  An emerging body of work highlights the application potential for clumped isotopes to reconstruct temperature and fluid properties in hydrothermal ore deposits. In mineral exploration, delineation of the heat footprint around an ore body provides critical insight into the processes that drive transport and deposition of metals. During proof of concept studies, clumped isotopes were used to provide accurate temperature reconstructions in epithermal, sediment hosted, and Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposits. These case studies are supported by measurement of carbonates in active geothermal settings. Limitations The temperature dependent relationship is subtle () (Quade 2007). 13C18O16O22‚àí is a rare isotopologue (‚âà60 ppm [3]). Therefore, to obtain adequate precision, this approach requires long analyses (‚âà2‚Äì3 hours) and very large and uncontaminated samples. Clumped isotope analyses assume that measured Œî47 is composed of 13C18O16O22‚àí, the most common isotopologue of mass 47. Corrections to account for less common isotopologues of mass 47 (e.g. 12C18O17O 16O2‚àí) are not completely standardized between labs.

Plot B.J. Quinn (John Barrett) is the current middleweight kickboxing champion of the world. His next opponent is Chad Hunter (Keith Vitali). Hunter proves to be quite the opponent with his impressive skills. In the second round, Quinn accidentally hits Chad with an elbow while going for a spinning back fist, causing the doctor to stop the fight. Quinn retains his title. At a party celebrating a new sponsor to kickboxing, middleweight contender and cocky fighter Jacques Denard (Brad Morris) hits on Quinn's girlfriend Carol (Terry Norton). Quinn, seeing what Denard is doing, begins to confront him. As the two begin to push each other, party goer Ken (Gavin Hood) gets into the mix to split them up. However, Quinn punches Ken so hard that he crashes through a table and ends up dead. At the trial, despite Chad's testimony that Quinn would have needed a reason to kill Ken, Denard's testimony proves enough to get Quinn convicted for twelve months on manslaughter charges. In addition, Quinn is no longer allowed to compete in professional kickboxing. A year has passed and Quinn has been freed from prison. Upon returning, he is shocked to learn that Denard, the man whose testimony has put him away due to pure hatred of him, has become the middleweight champion. Denard, in all his glory, proves to be a complete showboating type who resorts to using dirty tactics and has felt both the ire of kickboxing promoter Bob Wiser (Len Sparrowhawk) and the heckling of journalist Willard (Ted Le Plat), who had done the same to Quinn during his days as a champion. Meanwhile, Quinn had learned that Chad Hunter had stood up for him during the trial and has befriended him. Chad is up for a title shot against Denard and asks Quinn to train him. Quinn agrees, but he starts to let his personal demons catch up to him. During a sparring session, Quinn gets too rough with Chad, who confronts him. Quinn knows that Denard has gotten under his skin for a long time and he begins to take his frustrations out on both Chad and Carol. Chad loses badly to Denard in their title fight and is sent to the hospital, where Quinn again trashes Chad. At another party, a drunken Quinn finally confronts Denard and beats him relentlessly using a chair, prompting Carol to leave him. Depressed and alone, Quinn finds another place to live and slowly begins to realize the mistakes he has made. Chad, who has ultimately forgiven Quinn, asks Quinn to help out at his school. Defusing a situation between two students, Quinn again begins to value what he has and begins a road of redemption for himself through training. Carol returns and she and Quinn rekindle their relationship. Denard, upset from the beating at the party, decides to challenge Quinn to a fight. However, knowing that Quinn cannot fight as a professional, Denard makes the challenge for $100,000. When Quinn gets wind of the challenge after seeing the headline on the newspaper Willard writes for, Carol tells Quinn she will help him through this. In addition, Chad has offered to become Quinn's trainer. During a sparring session, Chad and Quinn go at it again when Quinn starts to somewhat hold back. It is there where Quinn finally lets everything loose verbally, but about himself. He said everything he had has is gone. However, Chad finally offers some words of encouragement and Quinn realizes that he hasn't lost it all. With the help of Chad and former trainer Howard (Roger Yuan), who after Quinn's imprisonment became Denard's cornerman but grew tired of his antics; Quinn begins to put his heart into his training and prepares for the big fight. The long-awaited fight finally happens. Once again, Denard's showboating and dirty tactics begin to take its toll on Quinn. When Quinn goes down during one of the later rounds, he gets up at a nine-count. Showing he isn't holding back anymore, he surprises Denard with his punches and kicks. When he lands a haymaker, Denard is sent flying to the corner with his legs rubbery. Quinn finally unleashes a flurry of kicks to Denard, and ends it with a tornado kick, sending Denard to the ground for the ten-count. As Chad, Howard, Carol, and others gather to congratulate B.J., Willard makes one more heckle at Denard before Denard's cornerman knocks him out cold with a punch.

It is believed that the film is set in California, despite its South African location and supporting cast. Sequels In 1993, two sequels to the film were released. American Kickboxer 2 was shot on location in the Philippines and starred another former kickboxing champion, Dale 'Apollo' Cook. It was a sequel in name only and featured Cook as a cop who is forced to team up with his ex-wife's former boyfriend, a martial arts instructor, to save his ex-wife's daughter. However, the true sequel to this film is entitled To the Death. It was directed by Darrell Roodt and featured John Barrett as the newly titled \\"Rick Quinn\\" and Michel Qissi replacing Brad Morris as Jacques Denard, who starts out as Quinn's rival but ultimately becomes his ally when he is forced in a series of fights to the death by a ruthless promoter.

A member of the genus Novomessor in the subfamily Myrmicinae, it was first described by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel in 1899. N. ensifer was originally a part of the genus Aphaenogaster until a recent phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct and should be separated. The ant is a medium-sized species, measuring . The ant is ferruginous-colored in some certain parts of the body, and small workers (nanitics) in incipient colonies are noticeably different in color and body structure. N. ensifer is active throughout the day, where they forage on the ground and sometimes on low herbs. Colonies are found under stones and other objects in tropical dry forests and pine-oak forests. These ants are solitary foragers and predominantly feed on insects such as wasps and moths. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). While nothing is known about its reproduction, nuptial flight may take place during spring or summer, where queens establish their nests under stones and other objects. Taxonomy Novomessor ensifer was originally described as Aphaenogaster ensifera in 1899 by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel, who provided the first description of N. ensifer in his third volume of Biologia Centrali-Americana. Among the genus Aphaenogaster, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery placed N. ensifer in the subgenus Deromyrma in 1915, although this is now a synonym. In 1934, the taxon Novomessor manni was described as a new species of Novomessor based on workers collected by William M. Mann at Colima, Mexico. However, a study showed that N. manni was a synonym of N. ensifer. Brown comments that N. manni was described as a new species because of the supposed distinct features between two type specimens of N. ensifer, but Brown noticed no morphological differences. The exact type locality for N. manni is unknown, but entomologist Paul Kannowski speculates that the ant is restricted to arid scrub forests around the Pacific Slope in Mexico. This speculation is consistent with the preferred habitat of N. ensifer. Novomessor was synonymized in 1974, although evidence to retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster. However, N. ensifer does not have this glandular system. English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster. In 2015, a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster, and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer, N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it. Description Head detail of N. ensifer N. ensifer is a medium-sized species, measuring . Excluding the mandibles, the head is long and wide. The scapes of the antennae surpass the occipital margin, and the second segment of the funiculus is longer than the first. The third and fourth segments are the same length as each other, although they are longer than the second. Between the fifth and second last segments, they are much shorter except for the last one. The head is twice as long than broad, and it is widest behind the eyes. The larvae measure in length and appear similar to that of N. albisetosus. The larvae can be distinguished by the abundance of hair with long stouts found on the body. The apical teeth of the mandibles are long and straight, whereas the medial teeth are much smaller. The posterior to the eyes are convex, where it converges towards the occiput (the back of the head) and forms a collar seen in several Aphaenogaster species. The ants have large, triangular mandibles with three apical teeth and a flat clypeus. The eyes are large with 400 facets, but workers from small incipient colonies only have 200 facets. Workers from incipient also differ from workers living in mature colonies, notably in size, body shape and coloration. The average length is ; the head is long and wide. The epinotal spines (spines found on the first abdominal segment that protect the pedicel) are much shorter. Hair is also less noticeable on the workers. The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) abundant throughout some certain parts of the body, including the funiculi and tarsi. It is more sparse on the coxae, genae (an area on both sides of the head below the eyes), gaster and gula (the reduced sternite of the first segment of the thorax). Hairs on the scapes point downwards. Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers, although this varies. These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species. The head and thorax are both ferruginous-colored, and the epinotal spines, legs and node are yellowish red. The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is piceous brown. The hair exhibits a gold-like color. The suture is absent from the thorax, and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum. The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular. The node is evenly round and oval shaped, the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex. The gaster is large and oval shaped. Distribution and habitat N. ensifer is endemic to Mexico and can be found in tropical dry forests at altitudes of between above sea level. In some cases, colonies have been found below the Pacific Slope. The ant is found throughout several Mexican states within the east, including Guerrero and Michoac√°n from the south, and Colima and Jalisco from the north. Nests are commonly found in basins and mountains along the Pacific Slope in pine-oak forests. Scrub-thorn forests are also abundant, consisting of trees and shrubs that are tall, but other areas may contain low herbs and grasses. Plants and trees such as thorn trees (Acacia), poinciana plants (Caesalpinia pulcherrima) and Casearia corymbosa have been identified in these habitats. Other identified plants and trees include Indian mallows (Abutilon), spurred anodas (Anoda cristata), Cathestecum erectum, dayflowers (Commelina), cigar plants (Cuphea), hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis), crane grass (Ixophorus unisetus), Mimosa, Mexican panicgrass (Panicum hirticaule), Senna uniflora and Setaria liebmannii. These habitats usually have a wet season in summer and autumn and a dry season in spring. N. ensifer is a xerophilous species that can thrive in dry climates. In Colima, colonies are frequent among the basins, but rarely are they found in the mountainous regions. N. ensifer ants prefer to nest in the sand and under large stones, as certain areas in Manzanillo had no stones buried in the soil and no colonies were found alongside hills with plain soil. Most colonies are found under stones with no noticeable craters surrounding the nest entrance, although one colony was found under an Acacia plant. These nest holes are usually in diameter. A single path connects the entrance to the main nest site, followed by a passage that descends straight into the dirt several inches deep. This passage widens under a stone which forms a gallery for the larvae and pupae. Wherever stones are formed, passageways may descend further into the ground and form more chambers. Although it is unknown how deep these passages go, excavated nests are as deep as . Behavior and ecology The giant horned lizard is a known predator of N. ensifer Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage early in the morning and late afternoon, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95‚Äì100 ¬∞F (35‚Äì38 ¬∞C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominantly feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown. Nothing is known about its reproduction or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not large enough to be reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs on the side of the larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.

Digital autopsy, simply, means conducting autopsy in computerized environment by digital tools. The first step of digitizing starts with the medical imaging modalities that provide the raw data images from the deceased. The most common modalities are Computerized Tomography (CT scan) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Three dimensional medical visualization is the technical process that provide the digital environment for exploration of the 3D body and conducting the digital autopsy. The term cannot be found before 1985 in the literature. However, there are many other similar terms like: Postmortem CT scanning for individual organs, volumetric radiologic scanning, Virtual Autopsy and Virtopsy.  History  One of the first documented Digital Autopsy studies was conducted at the department of Neuroradiology, University Hospital Mainz, Germany in the year 1980, where in 105 specimens of human stillborn and live-birth infants, ranging in age from gestational week 13 to postnatal month 18 were studied. Since then the arena of 2D CT scan images has gradually evolved to present day technologies of Multi-planar reconstructions (MPR) and real to life high definition 3D rendering. In the year 1998 various aspects of human and animal anatomy and pathology were successfully studied by Digital 3D examination on the ancient mummified specimens at the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam. Similar studies have also since then been done at the British Museum. The digital 3D analysis of data obtained from CT scanning the mummies has helped in visualization of the faces of some of the mummies, including that of chanters from the Temple of Karnak. This technology has also given vast information about the embalming and burial processes. In the year, 2009 CT scanning and digital analysis of DICOM data was successfully used by the VIFM, Australia during the phase 2 of the DVI process for the Victorian bushfires. All dead bodies and scattered remains were CT scanned in their body bags using specific protocols and analyzed. Digital examination helped not only in separating the presence of non-human remains, but also was useful at the time of autopsy to capture and analyze the identifying features in cases of severe disfiguration. Currently digital autopsy is being successfully used in many countries like Switzerland, The United States of America, The United Kingdom, Malaysia, and Japan. Radiologists may call it Post-mortem Computed Tomography (PMCT) that does not provide colourful 3D views. In Switzerland, it is called Virtopsy (virtual autopsy). Pathologists (Forensic pathologists) know this procedure as Digital Autopsy.  Concept  In a forensic autopsy or Post-mortem examination, body of deceased is examined to acquire information on the cause of death inclusive but not limited to manner of death in people dying sudden, unexpected, violent, drug-related, or otherwise suspicious deaths. Digital Autopsy tries to answer the same investigative questions without actual dissection as in a conventional autopsy. The main concept of Digital Autopsy came into existence to overcome some problems during conventional autopsies without losing the objectivity of post-mortem examination. The main problems in conventional autopsy are: * It is impossible to preserve the body after dissection and gather the findings with non-destructive and contamination-free procedures. * Data acquisition in some body regions are difficult to somehow impossible, particularly in cases of decomposition. * Observer-independent documentation of the evidence is not available * Data acquisition of the body with respect for the deceased, next of kin and religious obligations * Slow and incomplete data acquisition in disasters Showing only the muscles of the three dimensional body (This picture is created by iDASS and copyrighted to iGene Sdn. Bhd.) Showing only the bony skeleton of the three dimensional body(This picture is created by iDASS and copyrighted to iGene Sdn. Bhd.) Digital Autopsy would be a technical solution for above mentioned problems. Employing medical imaging modalities like CT or MRI scanners is the first step in order to examine the deceased visually without any destructive, contaminating and non-preservative procedures like dissection. Moreover, using these images with software processing in visualization is the second step toward acquiring data from difficult regions from anatomical perspective and dignity of the body. Digital bodies in the system can be examined multiple times and reported not only in text but also in variety of available media (photo, movie, etc.). In addition, quick evaluation of bodies and body parts in massive disasters is available in comparison to time-consuming procedure of conventional autopsy. However, there are few limitations in Digital Autopsy. The main constraint is the data that is provided by medical imaging modalities are based on X-Ray and Magnetic fields (CT and MRI) that limits the view to what can be recorded by these technologies. A very obvious difference is the real colour of internal body organs and their changes in the deceased, in comparison to what is simulated in the visualization software. The novelty of this technological solution has not given enough time for studies on the consistency of reports among different professionals on the same cases. Moreover, there are few articles about validity of Digital Autopsy in action.  Technology Computed tomography and MRI scanning are the most common imaging modalities employed for this Digital Autopsy. Furthermore, CT Angiography has been used to provide the imaging data for analysing the deceased. The work output of these modalities are standard image files (DICOM files). Each image may have a thickness of 5mm, which means after whole body scan (human average height of 175 cm) it would produce 3500 images (slices) of human body. Using volume rendering these two dimensional images are assembled to make a 3D projection of human body. The 3D model is painted through RGBA transfer function to a colourful model. All visualization and image processing features for manipulating and navigating this 3D model make digital tools for conducting a Digital Autopsy. These features enable pathologist to explore the entire body and examine interested regions and organs from different angles. Image processing algorithms help them to virtually remove layers of body tissues like skin, muscle and bones. Moreover, low density objects like air and high density objects like metallic foreign bodies can be marked and viewed in the three dimensional body. For instance, organs with air (inside) like sinuses or intestines can be separated from other parts or any remnants of bullet in body due to gunshot injuries.  Conducting an autopsy  The process starts with registration of the case with all corresponding meta-data in a Digital Autopsy Facility. The best place for these facilities are in neighbourhood of mortuaries because of considerations about security, carriage and body condition. The body would be scanned according to the schedule with proper adjustments for deceased body. It means there are different configuration for emitting the ray in deceased in comparison to live bodies. This step may take 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes depends on the abilities of scanner. The output is aforementioned DICOM files (around 3500 files for whole body scan) that would be sent for visualization process. The end result is a colourful 3D body that can be explored and examined for positive or negative findings with the digital tools. The process is not finished with 3D exploration. The findings would be reported digitally in a multimedia report. This report includes all textual results accompanied by images and recorded movie of Digital Autopsy during examination. This report is not only for common submission to the court but also to be displayed in the court for attendance.  Acceptance  There are not many justice systems around the world who have accepted the Digital Autopsy as their legal procedures of forensic investigations. While Switzerland is pioneering in the acceptance, countries like Israel with strong religious background does not accept forensic imaging as a substitute or in conjunction with autopsy report. This might be due to lack of cases and documentation. Some researchers tried to evaluate the reliability of Digital Autopsy in comparison with conventional (standard) autopsy that reveals totally 68% accuracy of Digital Autopsy regarding the pathogenetic mechanisms. In UK, the Department of Health is currently considering recommendations for an integrated national cross-sectional autopsy imaging service, based on a regional service provided by mortuary-based imaging centres. Furthermore, Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathologists prepared a document to standardize medico-legal post-mortem cross-sectional imaging in adults in the UK.

Career After a brief military career, Skipwith was elected a Member of Parliament for Malmsbury in 1696.History of Parliament Online - Skipwith, Thomas (c.1652-1710) On 31 March 1682, Dame Mary Davenant, widow of Sir William Davenant, sold Skipwith a half share in the Duke's Company. He later formed a partnership with his late father's clerk, Christopher Rich, to manage the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. During this time the theatre ceased performing serious dramatic works in favour of lighter entertainments, leading the noted actor Thomas Betterton to petition the Lord Chamberlain in protest. Personal life Skipwith was parodied by Delarivier Manley as 'Sir Peter Vainlove' in the Adventures of Rivella published in 1714. She described him as having:The Adventures of Rivella, or the History of the Author of The New Atalantis Manley also described his pursuit of two mistresses, and Skipworth's philandering led to him living apart from his wife on at least one occasion. In 1707, Isabella Wentworth, a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne, wrote privately of his return: Skipwith left substantial sums to his housekeeper, Susanna Gurney, and her daughter, Charlotte. Historian D. W. Hayton, who describes Skipwith as 'an engaging rou√©', suggests this 'strengthens the suspicion' that Gurney was also his mistress, and her daughter his illegitimate child.

It was the 78th edition of the Gent‚ÄìWevelgem race and the seventh event of the 2016 UCI World Tour. The race followed a course that started in Deinze and ended in Wevelgem in Belgium, with a portion of the race spent in northern France. The race included ten climbs, several of them cobbled, which provided the principal difficulty in the race. The last and most difficult climb was the Kemmelberg. The favourites for the race included Alexander Kristoff (), Fabian Cancellara () and Peter Sagan (). The race was won by Sagan, who escaped with Cancellara and Sep Vanmarcke () on the Kemmelberg after a series of splits had occurred in the first half of the race. They were joined by Vyacheslav Kuznetsov (), who had been in the day's early breakaway, and the four-man group came to the finish together. Sagan won the sprint, with Vanmarcke second and Kuznetsov third. During the French portion of the race, the Belgian rider Antoine Demoiti√© () crashed and was then hit by a race motorbike. He died that evening.  Route  The Kemmelberg was addressed by its toughest road, with slopes up to 23% gradient. The route of the 2016 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem was significantly changed from 2015 edition and from previous editions. Several different climbs were used. Central among these was the decision to use a different side of the core climb in the race, the Kemmelberg. In previous years, the route chosen had a maximum gradient of 17%, but the 2016 edition used a road that had a section at 23%, described by Cycling Weekly as \\"excruciating\\". The race director, Hans De Clercq, gave three reasons for the change: the cobblestones had recently been relaid; the 2016 edition marked the 60th anniversary of the inclusion of the Kemmelberg, with the difficult side used on that occasion; and there was a desire to give the race more of a balance between sprinters and attackers. , a Belgian work that lists and grades all the climbs in the country, rated the side of the Kemmelberg used in 2016 as the most difficult climb in Flanders: its grading of 183 points was more than the Koppenberg (172), the Muur van Geraardsbergen (171) or the traditional route up the Kemmelberg (152). The race started in Deinze in East Flanders, from Ghent. The route took the riders immediately into West Flanders. After of flat roads, they came near the coast at Veurne. Here the route took the riders south into northern France; after the peloton passed through Wormhout, then continued south of Steenvoorde, where there were the first climbs in the race. The first eight climbs came quickly, packed into a stretch of road. The first climb was the Catsberg; this was followed by the Kokereelberg, the Vert Mon, the C√¥te du Ravel Put and the C√¥te de la Blanchisserie. The riders then returned to Belgium and climbed the Baneberg, the Kemmelberg and the Monteberg. There was then a flatter section, looping through Mesen, Ploegsteer and Nieuwkerke. The final two climbs were a repeat of the Baneberg‚ÄìKemmelberg combination. At the top of the final climb, there were of fairly flat roads to the finish in Wevelgem.  Participating teams  There were 25 teams selected to take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited; the race organisers gave wildcard invitations to seven UCI Professional Continental teams. These included two Belgian teams ( and ), two French teams ( and ), a Dutch team (), an Italian team () and a Polish team (). Each team could include eight riders. 's team of seven was the only one submitted with fewer than eight riders, but three riders ('s Ian Stannard, 's Alexander Kristoff and 's Alexis Gougeard) did not start the race; 196 riders therefore departed from Deinze.  Pre-race favourites  There was some uncertainty before the race about whether it would favour the sprinters or those who attacked on the hills. Among the sprinters, Alexander Kristoff, the winner of the 2014 Tour of Flanders, was the favourite, with Andr√© Greipel (), Arnaud D√©mare (), Mark Cavendish (), Elia Viviani () and Fernando Gaviria () also considered possible winners. Kristoff, however, had to pull out of the race due to a fever that started after E3 Harelbeke two days earlier. There were also many riders who had the potential to attack earlier in the race. These included Tom Boonen (Etixx‚ÄìQuick-Step), who had won the race on three previous occasions, and his teammates Niki Terpstra and Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar. Peter Sagan (), the reigning world champion, had won the race in 2013 with a solo attack; he also had the ability to perform strongly in a sprint. He had not yet won a race in 2016. Other riders likely to attack early in the race included Fabian Cancellara (), Luke Rowe (Sky), Sep Vanmarcke (), Greg Van Avermaet () and Edvald Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data), who had won the 2009 edition of the race. The 2015 winner, Luca Paolini, was not present to defend his title due to his suspension following a positive test for cocaine during the 2015 Tour de France.  Race summary  Peter Sagan (), wearing the rainbow jersey of the reigning world champion (photographed at the 2016 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad) The race took place in windy weather. Combined with a crash, these conditions caused the peloton to break into several groups in the first part of the race. The first group was a five-rider breakaway, composed of Lieuwe Westra (), Pavel Brutt (Tinkoff), Josef ƒåern√Ω (CCC‚ÄìSprandi‚ÄìPolkowice), Jonas Rickaert () and Simon Pellaud (). Their lead extended to eleven minutes at one point, but was quickly reduced when the pace of the main peloton increased. This broke the peloton into echelons. By the halfway stage, there was a chasing group 90 seconds behind that contained many of the race favourites, including Boonen, Boasson Hagen, Cancellara, Sagan, Tiesj Benoot and Jens Debusschere (both Lotto‚ÄìSoudal), and Van Avermaet. They were chased by another group that was led by Trek‚ÄìSegafredo and LottoNL‚ÄìJumbo; this group was around a minute further behind. With remaining, the first chasing group caught the breakaway; later, this group was in turn caught by the other chasing group. There was therefore a 50-rider group at the head of the race. There was calm in the peloton for a while, with five climbs remaining to be raced. Trek‚ÄìSegafredo controlled the peloton over the Baneberg and the first climb of the Kemmelberg. Between the two climbs, however, Debusschere crashed and was forced to retire from the race. On the Monteberg, with remaining, five riders attacked. These were Matteo Trentin, who initiated the move, Brutt, Benoot, Daniel Oss () and Giacomo Nizzolo (Trek‚ÄìSegafredo). They were chased by Dimension Data and LottoNL‚ÄìJumbo, but it took to bring them back. When they were caught, Vyacheslav Kuznetsov (Katusha) attacked alone and had a minute's lead by the second climb of the Baneberg. Vanmarcke attacked on the Baneberg, but was chased down by the peloton, led by Manuel Quinziato (BMC). On the second climb of the Kemmelberg, from the difficult side, Cancellara attacked and was followed by Vanmarcke and Sagan. They caught Kuznetsov and formed a four-man leading group. They were chased at first by a group of Luke Rowe, Zdenƒõk ≈†tybar and Greg Van Avermaet, but were able to increase their advantage. The chasing group was caught by the peloton and the four leaders came to the finish together with a comfortable advantage. They had a lead of 40 seconds until they slowed down significantly in preparation for the sprint. Kuznetsov was the first to sprint; he was followed, however, by Sagan, who came past him to take the race victory. Vanmarcke finished just ahead of Kuznetsov to take second place, with Cancellara finishing fourth. The peloton finished eleven seconds behind, with D√©mare winning the sprint for fifth place.  Death of Antoine Demoiti√©  The race was marred by the death of Antoine Demoiti√© (). Demoiti√© crashed with four other riders near Sainte-Marie-Cappel during the French section of the race, with approximately of racing remaining. After the crash, he was lying on the road and was hit by a race motorbike that was following the riders. Demoiti√© was initially taken to hospital in Ypres before being transferred to the intensive care unit of the university hospital in Lille, due to the severity of his injuries. His team released a statement describing his condition as \\"extremely serious\\"; several hours later, a spokesman for the local gendarmerie confirmed that he had died. The crash was seen by Julien Jurdie, a ' for the team, who said that Demoiti√© had been part of a group chasing to get back to the peloton, travelling downhill at around . He said that, when the riders crashed, there was no time for the motorbike rider to brake and he immediately recognised that the incident was very serious.  Results  Finish line  Post-race analysis   Reaction to Demoiti√©'s death  Antoine Demoiti√© () (photographed in 2015) There was widespread sadness among those involved in professional cycling following Demoiti√©'s death, especially after a second young Belgian cyclist, 's Daan Myngheer, died after suffering a heart attack at the Crit√©rium International. Sep Vanmarcke tweeted \\"Suddenly a 2nd place no longer important after this terrible news.\\" Other riders, especially those in Demoiti√©'s team, also expressed their sadness. The team's ', Hilaire Van der Schueren, paid tribute to his rider, saying that he was \\"happy because he was a cyclist\\". Demoiti√© had made his first appearance at a World Tour race at E3 Harelbeke two days previously and had been in the day's main breakaway. Following his strong performance, he had asked to be allowed to stay in the main peloton in search of a good finish in Wevelgem. The team withdrew from the Three Days of De Panne the following week. As well as the tributes to Demoiti√©, many riders also called for improved safety for professional bike races. Many riders had been involved with crashes with race motorbikes in the previous few years, including Peter Sagan, Taylor Phinney, Greg Van Avermaet, S√©rgio Paulinho, Jakob Fuglsang, Jesse Sergent, Sylvain Chavanel and Stig Broeckx. Alberto Contador tweeted \\"Regulations on motos in races are needed NOW\\", while other riders called for clear rules, speed limits and exams for race motorbike riders. Marcel Kittel described rider safety as an issue that needed the same priority as anti-doping. Wanty‚ÄìGroupe Gobert's press officer said that the motorbike rider was experienced and was not to blame for the accident. The president of cycling's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), said that there would be an emergency meeting of its Road Commission to discuss the incident; he also said that they needed to wait for the result of the police enquiry and that it was important to make sure that the \\"right decisions\\" were made.  Reaction to the race  Peter Sagan's victory in the race was his first since winning the rainbow jersey at the world championships road race the previous year. It was the end of what Cycling Weekly called a \\"frustrating run\\" that had included second place at E3 Harelbeke two days previously. He said that he was very happy to have won in the rainbow jersey, especially as Gent‚ÄìWevelgem was an important race to him. He said that he was determined not to make the same mistake as he had in previous races by working hard in the final part of the race; Kuznetsov's early sprint then set him up for his own sprint. Vanmarcke said that he was \\"pleased with second place\\" as he had had a difficult race. He was trapped in the second echelon when the race split early on and it took a \\"long pursuit\\" to get back to the leaders. Although he was not quite able to follow Cancellara and Sagan on the final climb, he rode aggressively on the descent and got back to them. He said that he was very tired at the end of the race and that it was hard to beat Sagan and Cancellara. Cancellara said \\"for sure it‚Äôs happy Easter day but it‚Äôs not happy Gent-Wevelgem day\\" as he finished fourth out of four riders in the final sprint. He was happy, however, that he had always been at the front of the race and had not crashed. Cyclingnews.com wrote that he would still be the \\"principal favourite\\" the following Sunday for the Tour of Flanders.  UCI World Tour standings  Following his second place in E3 Harelbeke and his victory in Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, Sagan moved into the lead of the season-long UCI World Tour competition, seven points ahead of Richie Porte (BMC). Sagan's teammate Alberto Contador had moved up into third place after the Volta a Catalunya; Tinkoff moved into the lead of the teams' rankings. Australia remained at the top of the nations' rankings.

The set was revamped between series 1 and series 2. Changes to the set involved a change in the shape of the stage, meaning that from series 2 onwards, there was more stage space. From Series 2 onwards there was a colourful staircase next to the front door; each step was a different colour. The staircase lead the upstairs balcony part of the set, which contains Justin's bed, wardrobe and the bathroom. From Series 3 onwards, there were steps leading down from the stage into the audience, meaning that Justin and Robert sometimes went into the audience during songs. The BBC film the show at Dock 10 studios in Manchester in front of a live studio audience. Format The show usually starts with Robert singing the 'Dusting for Justin' song, before welcoming the audience to Justin's House. This is usually followed by Robert introducing the main theme of the episode, with the help of Little Monster. Justin then makes his entrance, usually through one of the doors in the house. Justin's entrance usually ends of creating some mess, for instance in Series 3 Episode 17 he opens the door into Robert, which causes Robert to throw custard pies everywhere. Justin and Robert then sing the Justin's House song. The show always ends with Justin, Robert, and any special guests that featured in that episode singing a song.

The film industry created the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI) in 1916 in an effort to preempt censorship by states and municipalities, and it used a list of subjects called the \\"Thirteen Points\\" which film plots were to avoid. The Struggle Everlasting, with its white slavery plot line, is an example of a film that clearly violated the Thirteen Points and yet was still distributed. Since the NAMPI was ineffective, it was replaced in 1922. Like many American films of the time, The Struggle Everlasting was also subject to restrictions and cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 1, the scene of woman apparently nude to include all scenes of bather up to point where she puts a garb over herself, Reel 4, closeup of women in one-piece bathing suits at pool, and, Reel 6, vision showing woman soliciting.

Town Center The U.P. Town Center is marketed as the \\"first and only university town center\\" in the Philippines primarily targeting students from universities and other educational institutions along Katipunan Avenue such as the University of the Philippines Diliman, Ateneo de Manila University, and Miriam College. Initially, shortly after the first phase of the complex was opened, most of the tenants were restaurants and other dining outlets. In November 2013, there were 30 tenants with 28 of them being dining outlets and only two being retail stores. By this time Ayala Malls were reportedly prioritizing new restaurant and dining brands over popular fast- food chains and restaurants since many of these brands already have outlets along Katipunan Avenue. Upon the completion of the second phase, numerous retail brands primarily selling fashion, sports, tech, and stationery goods or services targeting millennials opened stores at the U.P. Town Center. U.P. Town Center also has a supermarket named Merkado Supermarket. It is a 50-50 joint venture between Ayala and Puregold and the outlet in the shopping complex is the first outlet under the brand name.

Frank Fairfax worked his way through West Virginia State College and earned his B.S. degree in Business Administration in the spring of 1921. While attending college, he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and became active in vocal and instrumental groups, studying under Clarence Cameron White.Frank T. Fairfax's Obituary He learned to play the trumpet, trombone, tenor saxophone, and drums. Career When Frank Sr. joined Edwards' Collegians, a West Virginia territory jazz dance orchestra, he left his family with his mother and some siblings in Huntington, West Virginia. His wife and children joined him in Philadelphia in 1935.  Organizer of Protective Union Local 274 During the summer of 1933, Edwards' Collegians, a touring band, migrated to Pennsylvania for a dance tour.Nelson, Nels \\"The Man Who Knew When The Fight Was Over\\", Philadelphia Daily News February 6, 1972 Upon arriving in Philadelphia in the fall of 1933, the band signed for a steady gig at The Rafters in West Philadelphia and \\"ran straight into union trouble.\\" This was a Union band, carrying \\"Conditional Membership\\" cards from the American Federation of Musicians. Fairfax, the band's manager, found union recognition in this area unfavorable to black musicians.\\"Music Union Leader Dies\\", Philadelphia Tribune February 5, 1972 He wrote, \\"The musicians needed new union cards. The dues of (white) Local 77, AFM were then $15 a year, over and above a stiff initiation fee that the members of Edward‚Äôs Collegians simply could not afford. Each musician received only $3 for a night‚Äôs work.\\" Frank Fairfax contacted the president and secretary of the American Federation of Musicians: Joe Weber and William J. Kerngood, respectively, and after much discussion, was authorized to organize a new local in Philadelphia. Fairfax was instructed to secure the names and addresses of at least 75 interested (black) musicians. Damon Fisher, James Shorter, Harry Monroe, F. E. Walker, and a few others assisted him in recruiting the musicians to make the required number for the charter. After negotiations between Fairfax, Kerngood and the president of Local 77, the white union which claimed as members among many others, all the musicians of the world renowned Philadelphia Orchestra,Kirkland, Leon Pelzar, 'Jimmy' Adams founded the Philadelphia Clef Club, Philadelphia Tribune December 11, 1998 it was agreed that a charter would be granted under certain conditions satisfactory to Local 77 (prices, etc. must be the same) when $2.00 from each of the 75 musicians was collected and tendered. During the last few days of 1934, Fairfax received the charter, local seal and all other necessary materials for starting the new Local 274. He called the first meeting for nomination of officers (2nd floor, Little Harlem Bar, 400 block of south 18th Street). The charter was dated for January 6, 1935. Fairfax acted as chairman for this meeting. Their first election was held at the YMCA, 1924 Christian Street. Below are the elected officers of the new Local: * President............................George W. Hyder * Vice President....................Harry Monroe * Secretary............................Frank Fairfax * Assistant Secretary.............Harold Allen * Treasurer............................Wesley Fitzgerald * Sergeant-at- arms................Damon Fisher The configuration of officers changed periodically, throughout the duration of Local 274's existence, and Fairfax always held official positions, including president\\"Philly Union Gives Marva Final Okay\\", Afro-American Company of Baltimore City Feb. 25, 1944 but primarily executive secretary. Regarding union membership, bass player William Oscar Smith wrote, \\"The union opened an entire new dimension for the expansion and recognition of our art. I was one of the charter members of Local 274, American Federation of Musicians. Little did I realize the impact that membership would have on the rest of my life.\\" Local 274 received many commendations from civic and community groups for outstanding work, even, on numerous occasions, by the Federation itself, for running a well organized and exceptionally good Local.\\"Black Officers of Musicians' Local No. 274 Say Whites Are Welcome; Refuse to Disband\\", Philadelphia Tribune April 24, 1971 Throughout the years, Local 274's conduct was exemplary and their efforts on the part of the Federation were well recognized. During the post 1964 era of widespread desegregation under federal law, the AFofM was targeted by the AFL- CIO as one of the nation‚Äôs most segregated labor organizations. One by one, black musicians‚Äô unions in cities such as Pittsburgh, Detroit and Chicago were forced to merge with larger, more powerful white unions. In 1966, members of Local 274, under the leadership of their president James 'Jimmy' Adams, created the Clef Club, a separate entity but the \\"social arm\\" of Local 274. It had its own charter and its own liquor license. When, in 1968, the American Federation of Musicians handed down an order requiring Local 274 to disband and merge with Philadelphia Local 77, the members of Local 274 vigorously resisted the order, contending that their local, unlike the white local, never had refused to accept members because of race and that 274 was, in fact, already integrated.Black Musicians Union Loses Key Legal Battle, Philadelphia Tribune July 6, 1971 When the predominantly black local refused to obey the order to merge, The Executive Board of the AFofM ordered its expulsion in March, 1971. Subsequently, Local 274's officials filed a legal action in U.S. District Court seeking an injunction to restrain their expulsion from the AFofM on the grounds that such a merger \\"would deprive its members of control of their own affairs, their meeting house and their clubhouse liquor license.\\"\\"Union Won't Merge; Loses Charter\\" Afro ‚Äì American Company of Baltimore City July 17, 1971 However, in April, 1971, Judge Edward R. Becker stayed the March, 1971 expulsion. In his 23-page opinion refusing Local 274's plea to invalidate the expulsion, Judge Becker pointed out that Philadelphia was the last of the 37 cities to end dual unionism based on race in the musicians' field. Local 274's President Jimmy Adams prevailed in court against Local 77 when the latter sought to absorb all the assets of Local 274 when its charter was revoked in the spring of 1970. Instead of those assets going to Local 77, they went to the Philadelphia Clef Club, which eventually purchased a building on 13th and Washington Ave. In 1995 the Philadelphia Clef Club moved to its current location at Broad and Fitzwater Streets on Philadelphia Avenue of the Arts.McCarthy, Jack \\"Riffing on Philly Jazz History\\" Historical Society of Philadelphia Nov. 12, 2013 Following the expulsion of Local 274 from the AFofM in April, 1971, the musicians from Local 274 eventually joined Local 77, which, according to Diane Turner Ph.D., diminished Black musicians' power and status in the music industry. 1993 In May, 1971, Frank Fairfax moved to Local 77, AFofM and began serving as Assistant to the Project Chairman of the Music Performance Trust Fund.\\"Music Union Leader Dies\\", Philadelphia Tribune Feb. 5, 1972 Concurrently, he served as Secretary of the Philadelphia Clef Club of the Performing Arts, Inc. until his death.  Musician  Frank Fairfax's documented career as a professional musician began in 1928, when he played bass horn and trumpet alongside singer/trombonist Clyde Bernhardt (1905‚Äì1986) and many other musicians in Henry P. McClane's Society Orchestra, a West Virginia-based dance band. From July, 1929 through 1934, Fairfax was playing trombone for Phil Edwards' Collegians, a college dancing orchestra formed in 1928 in Bluefield, West Virginia, that toured the Eastern seaboard.[Frank T. Fairfax's Obituary], At some point in the first half of 1930, Edwards' Collegians landed a job as the house band for Cincinnati's Greystone Ballroom, from whence it regularly broadcast over WLW for a least eighteen months. Such was its reputation that in 1931 it earned eighth place in the Pittsburgh Courier's Most Popular Band Contest, a consequence, at least in part, of its presence on the airwaves. In 1932 and 1933, still led by Phil Edwards but managed by Frank Fairfax, the Collegians made an extensive tour of the southeastern United States. According to Cleophas \\"Chico Hicks, who played banjo and guitar for the band beginning in 1932, Fairfax took a large role in the booking and business management of the Collegians. The group's representative would travel ahead of the orchestra to different towns to find bookings, and then would meet with Fairfax, who would configure the schedule.Wriggle, John [Chappie Willet, Frank Fairfax, and Phil Edwards' Collegians: From West Virginia to Philadelphia\\" Black Music Research Journal, Vol. 27, No. 9 Spring, 2007, p. 9 Hicks also recalled that the group embarked on an extensive tour of the eastern United States, extending down the East Coast into the Deep South, through Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. Crisscrossing the region between performances at country clubs, dance halls, and local radio stations, the orchestra traveled in two 1926 Packards and a \\"Chevy cattle truck,\\" which carried most of the instruments. Fairfax and Hicks usually rode in the truck. Fairfax also wrote some of the music arrangements for Edwards' Collegians. However, a significant portion of the Collegians' repertoire consisted of Archie Bleyer's stock arrangements ordered from New York, including \\"Too Tired,\\" \\"Muddy Water,\\" \\"Just Around the Corner, Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, and Dvorak's \\"Humoresque.\\"Wriggle, John \\"Chappie Willet, Frank Fairfax, and Phil Edwards' Collegians: From West Virginia to Philadelphia\\" Black Music Research Journal, Vol. 27, No. 1 Spring, 2007, p.1 Being able to sight-read new tunes was an important component of performing with the band. By September 1933, Chappie Willet assumed leadership of the band, and subsequently it relocated the Philadelphia. They landed a steady job at the Rafters Club in West Philadelphia. Fairfax remained business manager and was first trombonist in Chappie Willet‚Äôs Orchestra in Philadelphia and also while performing with the same band on the campus of Princeton University in March, 1934.\\"Chappie Willet's Band Takes East\\", The Chicago Defender (National Edition) March 7, 1934, page 5 By late 1934 the band broke up.''  Bandleader  By December 1934, after Chappie Willet's band disbanded, Fairfax was leading his own band, called the Frankie Fairfax Campus Club Orchestra. A Philadelphia Tribune published an announcement of Fairfax's upcoming performance at the O. V. Catto Elks Lodge Hall on December 20, 1934. The band was said to be \\"\\"creating a new sensation among the younger club set.\\"Wriggle, John \\"Chappie Willet, Frank Fairfax, and Phil Edwards' Collegians: From West Virginia to Philadelphia\\" \\"Black Music Research Journal, Vol. 27, No. 1\\" Spring, 2007, p. 14 Fairfax soon returned to The Rafters,Nelson, Nels [No Sad Songs for Charlie Shavers at Wit's End] \\"Philadelphia Daily News\\" July 23, 1971 where his band had a violin trio, a trumpet quartet, trombone quartet, sax and clarinet quartet, and a very polished vocal ensemble. Other engagements for Frankie Fairfax‚Äôs band (its name would change many times, depending upon the venue) included Ubangi Club, Parrish Cafe, Oasis Ballroom, the Kit Kat, Club Logan, social club parties, charity balls, sorority and fraternity dances, private affairs, including a reception for the President of the Republic of Liberia and the President-elect of Liberia. But according to William Oscar Smith, the bass player for the Frankie Fairfax Orchestra from 1935 to 1937, the band‚Äôs home base was the Strand Ballroom in South Philadelphia. Smith describes the band in his book: \\"The band was just right in its blend of older experienced musicians and young lions. The veterans included Whitey Grove and Pete Brown on trumpets; Tasso Richardson and Nelson Wapler, saxophones; Fairfax and Bert Claggett, trombones. John Berry, tenor sax, and Bert Hall, drums, were of intermediate age. Ably led by the elders, the younger guys reaped the benefits of going on to make names for themselves, not only in Philadelphia but in New York, Chicago, and later the West Coast. They were Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Shavers, Johnny Lynch, Carl 'Bama' Warwick, and Palmer Davis on trumpets; Harold Reed, John Brown, and Shorty Cawthon on saxophones; Calvin Jackson and Ernie Washington on piano; and Norman Dibble and Shadow Wilson on drums.\\" Other well-known musicians that performed in Fairfax‚Äôs band were John Hamilton and Bill Doggett. The Frankie Fairfax Band was heard on the airwaves from Philadelphia radio station WDAS. However, no recordings were made. William Oscar Smith wrote, \\"Rehearsals were a joy. Everybody was there at least an hour ahead of time. We were discovering each other, and, best of all, we were discovering music. We learned to play hard tunes with difficult chord changes. We played these challenging tunes starting in the original key and proceeding a half step up each chorus until we returned to the original key. Imagine playing tunes like \\"Body and Soul,\\" \\"Sweet and Lovely,\\" and \\"Smoke gets in Your Eyes\\" in this fashion. If nothing else, a few weeks of this would give you control of your ax (your horn, or whatever you were playing). A year of this with frequent rehearsals and gigs would put anybody at the top of his game. This band did not play stock arrangements; we played only our own written or \\"head arrangements.\\" With head or ear arrangements, we built up a repertoire in which no written music would be in sight... What we usually got was a crowd-pleaser. We gave them titles like \\"The Uptown Breakaway,\\" \\"The Broadway Stomp,\\" or \\"The Ridge Avenue Shuffle.\\" A lengthy strike in 1938 at the Nixon Grand Theater, where Fairfax's orchestra was the band, was the beginning of the end for that 12-piece work of art. Some of the regulars drifted to other jobs and the draft boards soon picked away at. For the remainder of Fairfax‚Äôs musical career, he formed smaller combos: quartets or trios, under different names. In 1943, he formed The Frankie Fairfax Masters of Rhythm; in 1947, Frankie Fairfax‚Äôs Cracker Jacks played at the North Philly bar, The Web, The Musical Bar, and in mainstem houses in north and south New Jersey. The pianist was Marian Murphy; bass player, \\"Sneaky Pete\\" Briggs; guitarist, Roosevelt Sherman or Dick Hill, and Frankie played tenor saxophone, trombone, trumpet, and bongo drums. Also in the 1940s, Frankie Fairfax and his Trio (Marian Murphy, piano; Dick Hill, guitar and vocals; and Frankie Fairfax, tenor saxophone, trumpet and congas) played at O‚ÄôShea‚Äôs Wagon Wheel in Harrisburg, PA. and at the Hi Hat Cafe. Frankie Fairfax‚Äôs last engagement as a working musician was in December, 1971 at a Model Cities Christmas party at Girard College.  Personal life and death  Frank married Kathryn Ione Adams, daughter of Dr. Arthur Stewart Adams and Mary Leota Taylor Adams in 1925. Their offspring were Dolores Anita Fairfax and Frank Thurmond Fairfax, Jr. On January 25, 1972, at the age of 72, Frank T. Fairfax died in Hahnemann Hospital, of pneumonia and complications attending his cardiac condition. Members and officers of Consumers Education and Protective Association International Inc. (CEPA) expressed their deep regrets and sorrow at the passing of Mr. Frank Fairfax, a devoted CEPA member and Treasurer of the West Oak Lane Branch. Mr. Fairfax was always ready to respond to the call of any consumer in need of the organization‚Äôs assistance.\\"Frank Fairfax Passing Mourned\\", Consumers Voice, Let the Seller Beware, Vol. 7, No. 2, February, 1972 A delegation of CEPA members led by Mr. Garland Dempsey, International President Max Weiner, Executive Director, attended the services held on January 30 at the Emmanuel Johnson Funeral Home.

His artwork was influenced by that of fellow Montana artist Charles M. Russell. Powell's lifetime body of work consists of between 12,000 and 15,000 artworks. Although he preferred working with oil paints, he also produced a large number of watercolor paintings and drawings, as well as a number of works in bronze, terracotta, and wood. Early life Powell was born in Tularosa, New Mexico, on April 3, 1912. In 1913, at age one, his family moved to Montana where he spent his formative years in Apgar. His father worked as a wrangler and guide in Glacier National Park. Powell attended high school in Browning, on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. While in his early 20s, Powell took up a post as a wrangler on the Bar X5 ranch near Babb, Montana, and handled horses for the Glacier Park concessionaire. As a young man Powell, whose parents were friends of Charles M. Russell, made the acquaintance of Russell whose summer home, Bull Head Lodge, was located in Apgar. He took a few private lessons from the great master, but for the most part Powell was a self-taught artist through trial and error. Marriages When Powell's first wife Helena‚Äîwho was born in Smolensk, Russia, in 1908‚Äîdied in the bitterly cold winter of 1941, he joined the Army Air Corps and worked in a defense plant. Thereafter he was in the plastic figurine business in Yakima, Washington. He married a second time around 1946 to Audrey Scott, the union producing a son, Eddie. The marriage, however, would be short-lived as the couple was prone to fighting and she eventually left him. Powell's heavy drinking may have been a factor in their parting of the sheets. In 1952 he married fellow artist Nancy McLaughlin and the couple made their home in the town of Hungry Horse, a few miles east of Bad Rock Canyon, and operated a combination studio and gallery. A son, Dave Powell‚Äîwho would go on to be a fine artist in his own right‚Äîwas born to the couple. It was during this period that Powell gained much of his reputation and began to garner a following of collectors who would patronize him for the rest of his career. Their gallery/studio would burn to the ground in 1964, and shortly thereafter he and Nancy were divorced. His fourth marriage, in 1965, was to Thelma Conner and they made their home in Kalispell. College at University of Montana In about 1952 he attended the University of Montana at Missoula on the G.I. Bill. He found that the university's art department stressed abstract art, which wasn't a style particularly well suited for a realist painter such as himself. One of his teachers told him that he couldn't make a living as an artist and would have to teach art. When another instructor revealed that as a first-year teacher he was making $4,400, Powell replied, \\"Well, I'm an alcoholic and I was drunk half of the time last year and still make $7,500 so I've got no business here!\\" With that he quit. He subsequently took a correspondence art course and learned to organize the things he had been taught over the years into formal presentations. Career During his career, Powell produced between 12,000 and 15,000 works of art. His preferred medium was oil painting, however he also worked extensively with watercolors. He also executed a number of works in bronze, terracotta, and wood. With regard to painting, Powell said: \\"I see a scene in my mind and I put it down on canvas. I want it to look like it came from the land. If at all possible, I try to get a crisp feeling into my paintings. Sometimes I get something into a canvas that is just right, then I work around it\\". In 1962 a Cincinnati, Ohio, couple took their one and only vacation to Glacier Park. They noticed a man in a cowboy hat painting at his easel near the Lake McDonald Lodge. Impressed by the artist‚Äôs work, they commissioned Powell on the spot to produce a large 4x8 foot mural painting featuring Lake McDonald. Long after the buyers were deceased, a deal was consummated in 2013 by a partnership consisting of Freedom Bank in Columbia Falls, Glacier Park National Fund, and Kalispell art dealer Kevin Moore to buy the painting at an undisclosed price from the unnamed couple‚Äôs daughter who wished to remain anonymous and still lived in Cincinnati. The painting had been purchased for the purpose of covering a bay window at the couple‚Äôs Cincinnati home. ‚ÄúThey would rather look at Glacier National Park every day‚Äù than the view outside their window, Moore said. After being on display for a time in the Freedom Bank lobby, the painting was eventually donated to the Glacier National Park Fund and was relocated to Lake McDonald Lodge. As a fundraiser, 100 gicl√©e oil-on-canvas reproductions were later sold by the Ace Powell Gallery at a price of $395 each, with a number being sold to Kalispell businesses. In a 1978 article written by Dr. Van Kirke Nelson for Art West Magazine, Nelson cites Powell as saying, \\"I have been more fortunate than most, helped and have been helped, painted some great paintings and some terrible paintings. There were times when I thought the price I was charging was close to larceny‚Äîso I have never regretted someone else making a dollar on my paintings as I'll get it back from them next time. I've shaken hands with the devil, perhaps more than most, but the good Lord has seen fit to keep me around for a bit longer\\". Death and legacy Powell died on January 25, 1978 in Kalispell, Montana. Upon his death, many dealers holding unsold Powell canvases immediately doubled their prices. He is best remembered as one of finest painters of American western art in the 20th century. Awards and honors Note: This list is incomplete. * The Ace Powell Award, named in Powell's honor as the award's first recipient, is given by the Western Art Association of Ellensburg to an artist who has made a significant contribution toward historical western art heritage or who has encouraged or supported western artists in an outstanding manner.

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Glengarry homestead complex is situated on a hill overlooking the Boyne River Valley and the Gladstone-Monto road and comprises a brick residence and timber outbuildings constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Port Curtis Pastoral District was developed in the early 1850s when the area was still part of New South Wales (the separation of Queensland did not occur until 1859). In 1853 a government survey of 7000 square kilometres was carried out. The leading pioneer pastoralist in the Boyne Valley was William Henry Walsh who arrived in 1853 and held several huge runs which comprised most of the Valley. The head station was Milton, applied for in 1856. In 1868 the boundaries of this run were surveyed and included the area which later became Glengarry station. Following the Crown Lands Alienation Act in 1868, large runs were broken up and resumed for selection as grazing properties. Because of the relative isolation of the valley, Milton remained intact longer than most properties in the area, but was divided for resumption in 1883 into comparatively large grazing blocks. John Dickinson applied for a portion at this time, but the application did not succeed, although in 1885 his daughter, Isabella, was granted a lease of . Dickenson already held Portion 9V, Grazing Farm 52 of , on the opposite bank of the river when he selected Portion 26V, Agricultural Farm 79 of , on which the homestead is located. This portion was gazetted on 15 July 1892 and was at the time recorded as having no improvements on it. The adjoining Portion 504 was also obtained by Dickenson in 1897. In 1898, a report was made on the selection by the Bailiff of Crown Lands as part of the conditions of sale. Dickenson is stated to have resided there since 20 March 1894 and improvements to the land were reported to be a brick house, valued at , a detached kitchen clad in weatherboards, yards and a large hardwood shed in the approximate position of the stables, all roofed in galvanised iron. There were also a small pig sty and fowl house. The detached kitchen was presumably reclad in corrugated iron at a later date. It appears to be an earlier building than the house and was probably the original homestead, which was relegated to kitchen use and perhaps servant accommodation when the new homestead was built. This manner of replacement and reuse of buildings as the property developed was a practice so common as to have become traditional. The other outbuildings on the property were presumably constructed soon after the 1898 survey, and may even contain recycled material. John Dickenson died in 1920, but the property passed to other members of the family and was held by them until 1946 when it was purchased by William Bryce. In the early 1960s, Glengarry was purchased by I O F McDonald who had a large modern annexe constructed at the eastern end of the residence. He also had a section of the verandah built in to provide bathroom and laundry facilities. Because of concerns about the viability of Glengarry as a working property following the construction of Awoonga Dam, it was purchased by the Gladstone Area Water Board on 1 August 1979. The property has been leased for grazing purposes since 1983. The buildings are not inhabited although they have been used as temporary shelter from time to time by contract workers and have water and power connected. Although the dairy, stables, blacksmith's shop and buggy shed were still standing when recorded by the National Trust in 1979, they have since collapsed. The Awoonga Dam project at its highest projected levels will make an island of the site from time to time. This level of inundation is not planned for about 50 years.  Description  The Glengarry homestead complex consists of a brick dwelling with a modern annexe, a detached kitchen and a number of farm outbuildings. They are situated on a hill with extensive views of the surrounding countryside. The main residence is a single storey brick building, rectangular in plan, with a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron. It has verandahs to all four sides supported by timber posts. A section of the verandah on the northern side has been built in to provide modern bathroom and laundry facilities. The walls are painted except for the narrow band between verandah and main roofs and this reveals rose red bricks pointed in white cement. The bricks are laid on a course of local sandstone in a modified garden bond pattern, though this varies between walls. There is a camber arch fan over each external door. The interior has 3 rooms leading into each other. Cedar French doors open onto the verandah and the internal doors are constructed from vertical boards. The rooms are ceiled with beaded boards and have small pierced timber ceiling roses. The floorboards, believed to be local white cedar, are covered with lino imitating carpet. There is a modern annexe at the eastern end of the building. This is constructed of fibrous cement sheeting and glass on a timber frame and is set on low concrete stumps. It is separated from the older section by a breezeway, its flat metal deck roof abutting that of the verandah facing it. A small section of the edge of the verandah roof has been removed where it touches the roof of the annexe. Behind the brick building is a detached kitchen connected to it by a covered way. This has a frame of hardwood poles and a pyramid roof with a decorative metal ventilator and brick chimney. The roof and walls are clad with corrugated iron. The floor is of rammed earth topped with a layer of bricks and concrete. It has a main room with an open brick fireplace and chimney and two further rooms to the north. There are sash windows to the west and south walls, those on the west shaded by metal sunhoods with a pierced thistle motif. The north and east walls have modern hopper windows in the original openings. To the north east of this building is the butcher's shop, constructed of timber and sheet iron. The central section has an arched roof of corrugated iron supported by a pole frame and is flanked by two skillion roofed sections. That to the south has corrugated iron sheeting to the walls, that to the north is now open but has the remains of timber slabs. About further north is a single storey timber building set on low stumps. It has a hipped roof with a skillion extension clad in corrugated iron. The walls are clad with sawn weatherboards and it has a timber floor. Adjoining this are the remains of the buggy shed and blacksmith's shop, which have completely collapsed. Approximately to the north west is the dairy which has collapsed completely. It can be seen to have had a corrugated iron roof, flagged floor, hardwood pole frame and slab walls. To the south west, under a fig tree, are the remains of the stables, which appear to have a similar construction. There is a highset fibrous cement clad cottage, possibly interwar, about north west of the homestead complex. A tennis court in front of the main residence is visible only as a section of level ground edged with fragments of nailed-down white plastic tape which once outlined the court. Plantings such as two mango trees outside the kitchen, mulberry, citrus, lagaeostromia, hibiscus and Burdekin plums survive. There is a rockery feature to the south west of the homestead.  Heritage listing  Glengarry Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Glengarry homestead, as a complex of residential and working buildings constructed in traditional forms and materials and associated with the operation of a pastoral property, is important in illustrating the early pastoral settlement of the Boyne Valley in the Port Curtis region. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Glengarry is the earliest homestead on its original site in the area as several earlier homesteads have been destroyed or removed. The main residence is thought to be the only brick homestead of its era in Central Queensland, the more readily available timber or local stone being generally preferred for construction. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The homestead in its setting, together with its outbuildings, has the potential to yield information about the life and work of pastoralists in the Boyne Valley. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The formal main house with an earlier residence used as a detached kitchen, quarters, butcher's shop, blacksmith, dairy, stables and other sheds are good examples of their type. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The main residence is pleasing in form, scale and materials and is set on a hilltop with extensive views to the mountains over a broad sweep of countryside. It is a local landmark due to this high position. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The homestead is important for its association with the life and work of the Dickenson family, early settlers in this area.

It was designed by James Percy Owen Cowlishaw and built from 1910 to 1911 by A A Carrick. It is also known as Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd (Gladstone Branch). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 March 1999.  History  Kullaroo House was constructed in 1910-11 for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC), which moved into the building in June 1911. It was designed by Brisbane architect James Percy Owen Cowlishaw, who designed many of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney's Queensland premises. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd had been formed in New South Wales by local interests in 1834, and had established its first Queensland branch at Maryborough by 1860. A branch was opened in Gladstone on 9 June 1897, long after the Australian Joint Stock Bank and the Queensland Government Savings Bank had opened offices there in the mid-1860s, but predating the Queensland National Bank (1905) and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1912). The move by the CBC into Gladstone in 1897 appears to have been associated with the 1896 opening of the Gladstone meatworks and extension of the northern railway from Brisbane to Gladstone. By the turn of the century the ubiquitous cattle tick was decimating the local grazing industry, affecting meatworks production and cattle shipments. This, coupled with the great drought of 1900-02 and the 1903 opening of the Rockhampton extension of the northern railway (which immediately deprived Gladstone of substantial port trade and passenger shipping), caused a crisis in business confidence in the town. The development of a local dairying industry, however, and the 1905 opening of a butter factory at Gladstone, did much to revive the town's fortunes, and the future of town and district appeared secure in 1909 when new Gladstone premises were being planned for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. Initially, the Bank had leased shop premises at 22 Goondoon Street, then in 1901 took a 10 year lease on premises at 30-32 Goondoon Street. As the expiration of the lease approached, the Bank made the decision to invest in new, purpose-built banking premises. The site at the southeast corner of Goondoon and Yarroon Streets, in the heart of Gladstone, was purchased in February 1909 for . Brisbane architect James Percy Owen Cowlishaw, son of early Brisbane architect James Cowlishaw, was commissioned to design the building, and the tender was let in May 1910 to AA Carrick of Brisbane, with a tender price of . In July 1910, the Bank appointed James Beattie as Clerk of Works to supervise construction. JPO Cowlishaw's design was for a two-storeyed building, with banking chamber on the ground floor and manager's residence on the upper floor. The Gladstone manager, Mr WB Thomas, was keen to see a building of some substance erected: \\"The figures of the Branch and the good prospects of both town and district, entitle a fairly good building. With the splendid harbour here there is every possibility that in time the town will develop into one of some importance\\". There was no local brickworks at Gladstone, and the manager recommended concrete rather than timber construction. However, when he saw the plans prepared by Cowlishaw for a two-storeyed building of face brickwork, he was delighted: \\"The building will be by far the best in town, and a good advertisement for the Bank\\". Despite the contractor having some difficulty in managing the project satisfactorily, Beattie worked to ensured that the contract was completed, and the building was handed over to the bank on 13 May 1911. Interior fittings were fixed, and the bank opened for business in its new premises in June 1911. In the ensuing months a concrete retaining wall was erected at the rear of the site and along part of Yarroon Street, and picket fences erected on parts of both street frontages. The two-storeyed brick premises at the corner of Goondoon and Yarroon Streets served the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney for nearly 50 years. In the mid-1950s the bank commissioned new premises in Goondoon Street (designed by JPO Cowlishaw's son, architect George Owen Cowlishaw of Ure, McNaught & Cowlishaw, Brisbane), which opened on 26 May 1958. In September that year, the Bank accepted an offer of from Gladstone businessman Mr MA Busteed, to purchase the former banking premises (land and building). From the early 1960s at least, the building was occupied as a boarding house, known as Kullaroo House. The name Kullaroo is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning road that leads to water, and from the upper verandahs of Kullaroo House fine views of Gladstone harbour can be obtained. In the 1970s, new owners Goodwin, McKenzie, Forbes and Partners, lawyers, refurbished the building as law offices, retaining much of the original detailing. In the late 1980s Kullaroo House was used as a restaurant and in 1993 was acquired by the Gladstone Port Authority, which refurbished the building for office expansion. It is understood that at this time, most of the internal first floor partitions were removed. In 1996-97 further refurbishments were carried out and a large extension, imitating the original detailing, was constructed. Currently, both floors of the 1911 building contain office accommodation.  Description  Kullaroo House, the former Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Building, is a substantial two-storeyed brick building prominently situated in Goondoon Street, overlooking Gladstone Harbour. The building is rectangular in plan with a large extension, which is connected to the rear of the eastern corner of the building. The building has a double height verandah on three sides and a projecting double height entry porch The porch is detailed with classical elements. The building has a hipped corrugated iron roof with a smaller hipped section over the porch. Three tall chimney stacks, of alternating bands of light and dark brickwork project through the roof. The original layout of the bank contained the banking chamber and associated offices on the ground floor level, with the manager's residence above. When constructed, Kullaroo House was face brickwork, but the building has subsequently been painted and this diminishes the architectural articulation of the design. Kullaroo House is entered via a flight of stairs leading to the entrance porch. The porch is plastered brickwork which distinguishes it from the rest of the building. The plasterwork is rusticated, on either side of the entrance double height pilasters support a triangular pediment. The pilasters have composite capitals and decorative swags. On the upper level of the porch the arched openings have been enclosed and the space is used as an air conditioning plant room. The two storey verandah has a small projecting roof at first floor level and is detailed in timber with paired columns, slatted balustrade and valance. On the southern section of the ground level verandah, the balustrade has been removed and the columns have been sliced off above ground floor level and are supported by concrete plinths. At ground floor level all the major rooms associated with the original design of the building as a bank remain intact. The entrance porch opens onto the main banking chamber, which has all its original cedar door and window joinery, pressed metal ceiling and black marble fireplace. Part of the original cedar counter remains and has been modified for modern office use. The original safe is at the rear of the chamber and is intact with its patent fireproof door and domed concrete ceiling. Two large rooms open to the east off the main chamber. These rooms have cedar joinery, pressed metal ceilings and white marble fireplace surrounds that are intact with register grates and decorative tiles. A small room at the rear of the banking chamber has an external door to the verandah and leads to the stair hall which has an intact cedar staircase and pressed metal ceiling. An arched opening at the end of the stair hall leads to the section of the building constructed in 1996-1997. Behind the stair hall is a large room that has been created from two smaller rooms; it has a dropped ceiling and a new door to the verandah. The stair case leads to the second level. On this level all the original ceilings have been removed and replaced with a dropped ceiling, with fluorescent lighting and air conditioning grilles. Most of the internal walls have been removed to create a large open office space. As this level was the residence of the bank manager, most of the rooms had french doors opening onto the verandah. The french doors remain, but benches and desks have been built across the doors so that they no longer operate as doors. The 1997 extension is set back from Goondoon Street; externally it mimics the classical detailing of the original building. The junction of the original building and the extension is marked on the roof line by a timber belvedere with a corrugated iron roof. The extension does not form part of the heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Kullaroo House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 March 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kullaroo House, erected in 1910-1911 as new premises for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney's Gladstone branch, is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, demonstrating the renewal of business confidence in Gladstone and district in the early years of the 20th century. It was one of the CBC's more substantial regional offices, and illustrates how Gladstone was perceived at the time as potentially an important regional centre. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Despite a number of late 20th century refurbishments, the building still illustrates the principal characteristics of a substantial, early 20th century, two-storeyed brick banking premises with classical detailing, designed to impress. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is aesthetically pleasing, is located on a prominent site in the principal street of Gladstone, and makes a strong contribution to the Gladstone townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is considered locally as one of Gladstone's finest buildings, and is of landmark status. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important as a fine example of the work of Queensland architect JPO Cowlishaw, and in illustrating the work of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney in central Queensland in the first half of the 20th century.

It is a low shrub with a restricted distribution but which often occurs in large numbers, forming a dense ground cover. It can be distinguished from the three others in its genus by a combination of the size and arrangement of its leaves and the appearance of its fruits. Description Diocirea violacea is a shrub with many stems and which sometimes grows to a height of and spreads to a width of about . Its branches often have many short hairs and glands producing a resin that dries white. The leaves are arranged spirally around the stems and are mostly long, about wide, glabrous and sticky due to the presence of resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 egg- shaped, pointed green sepals with hairs on their edges. The five petals are joined to form a tube long with unequal lobes which are about long. The tube is white, spotted purple on the inside and on the bases of the lobes. The tube is mostly glabrous except for a few hairs on the lower lobes. There are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond the petal tube. The fruit that follows flowering is a flattened oval shape, long with distinct ribs. Taxonomy and naming Diocirea violacea was first formally described by taxonomist Bob Chinnock in Eremophila and allied genera: a monograph of the plant family Myoporaceae in 2007 from a specimen collected south of Norseman.

It was built from 1924 to 1950. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Our Lady Star of the Sea church at Gladstone was erected in 1924. The adjacent school was built in 1950, replacing a 1902 building destroyed in the cyclone of 1949. Following an abortive attempt to establish a settlement at Port Curtis in 1847, the township of Gladstone was surveyed in 1853 and by January 1854, Sir Maurice O'Connell was installed as the Government Resident, Police Magistrate and Commissioner of Crown Lands. Although there was pressure from pastoralists to open up the Port Curtis District, northern agitation for the separation of Queensland from New South Wales was mounting and the New South Wales government may have hoped to establish a more northerly potential capital than Brisbane for the new colony. In February 1854 the first land sales of Gladstone town and suburban land were held in Sydney. Although the Catholic presence in the Gladstone district was not large at the time, the Catholic Primate of Australia, (the Archbishop of Sydney Bede Polding) bought a number of allotments on Auckland Hill in these sales. Bishop James Quinn, Queensland's first Roman Catholic Bishop, visited Gladstone in 1868 and encouraged the formulation of plans for a church. The land purchased by Polding was very steep and in 1870 land was acquired between Auckland Streets and Oaka Lane for a church and in Rosebery Street for a convent/primary school. St Mary's School opened in 1871, staffed by Sisters of the Order of St Joseph, and served for some years as a church also. In 1879 the Sisters were withdrawn from Queensland and in the 1880s and 1890s Catholic pupils were educated at a school run by Mrs Annie Breslin at her residence in Goondoon Street. St Mary's Church was opened in January 1874 on the Auckland Street land acquired in 1870 but without a resident priest. For many years, its congregation was served by visiting priests, mainly from Rockhampton. In 1882 the Diocese of Rockhampton was established under the Right Reverend Dr John Cani, the first Bishop, and the first resident priest was appointed to Gladstone in 1885. By the turn of the century, the coastal railway was being extended to Gladstone, bringing an increase in population to the town. In 1901, responsibility for the Catholic parish at Gladstone was transferred from the Diocese of Rockhampton to the Marist Fathers. In the same year, the church land at Auckland Street was resumed for railway purposes and a new site was purchased covering two acres bounded by Goondoon Street, Herbert Street and Glenlyon Road and overlooking the harbour. The new site was intended for the building of a church, school, convent and presbytery. The new church school, designed by Architects Eaton and Bates, opened in January 1902 staffed by three Sisters of Mercy from Rockhampton. They were housed temporarily in a cottage in Rosebery Street until the convent, a timber building, was completed in June 1902. In September the new presbytery was completed, a two-storey timber building erected at Dean Murlay's own expense and known as Villa Maria. To serve the projected needs of the parish more fully, the Right Reverend Dr Joseph Shiel, Bishop of Rockhampton, laid the foundation stone of a larger new church on 13 April 1924. This was erected adjacent to the 1902 church school and was officially opened on 16 November 1924 at a cost of . The older building continued to function as a school. In the second half of the 1930s, Gladstone experienced renewed economic and population growth following the 1935 takeover of Gladstone Meatworks by the American company Swifts, which increased production. In 1936 fundraising to enlarge the church commenced and the extensions were opened in 1938. In the early 1940s, plans to raise the school and to construct brick classrooms underneath were formulated, but did not eventuate as a bequest of enabled the parish to plan for a new school. About 1943, the Brisbane architect Frank Cullen was commissioned to prepare plans for a school to accommodate 300 pupils. Cullen was an articled pupil of Hennessy, Hennessy and Co in Brisbane and Sydney 1928-1933. He worked for some time for the Queensland Government and was registered as an architect in 1935. Wartime building restrictions prevented the implementation of plans and not until 1947 was a building permit granted. By this time the plan had been modified to accommodate a further 100 children, necessary because of the strong growth in the Gladstone Meatworks at this period. The contract was let to Young and Sons of Bundaberg for a price of . When work on the new school had only just begun, the 1902 school and convent buildings were destroyed in the cyclone that struck Gladstone on 2 March 1949. Throughout 1949-50 Our Lady Star of the Sea School was located temporarily at the Town Hall, Our Lady Star of the Sea Church and in two pavilions in the show grounds. Archbishop James Duhig officially opened the new school on 20 April 1950. The three- storey brick building, which included a basement assembly hall, library, projector for \\"visual education\\" and a public address system on all three levels, was considered one of the most modern school buildings in Queensland. The new convent was completed in 1952. Gladstone experienced a boom in the second half of the 1960s with the opening of the Gladstone powerhouse, bauxite refinery and alumina smelter and rapid expansion of farming and grazing in the Dawson and Callide Valleys. Between 1965 and 1970 a number of changes were made to Our Lady Star of the Sea complex including the closing of Central Lane between the convent and presbytery on one side and the church and school on the other. Retaining walls were erected in front of the Convent and Presbytery, a parking area and basketball court bitumen coated and the sanctuary and church remodeled in line with the provisions laid down by the Second Vatican Council. These included cutting down the altar rails and the converting the altar into a table form. In 1966 the Gladstone Catholic High School began as a small class conducted underneath the presbytery and in 1967 the Stella Maris College for girls opened in West Gladstone staffed by the Sisters of Mercy. In the following year a boys' school, Chanel College, was established at the new location and staffed by the Marist Brothers. The two Colleges opened as Gladstone Catholic High School on 21 April 1968. In the late 1960s the Marist Sisters were invited to Gladstone to staff the convent school and in 1971, the first extension to the Star of the Sea Primary School was opened, the Marist Sisters taking over around 1972. Further extensions to the school were blessed in 1981. In July 1982, Villa Maria, the presbytery, was demolished and in 1983 the Sisters of Mercy moved into a new convent in Morley Street.  Description  The Our Lady Star of the Sea church and school complex is situated in an elevated position overlooking the harbour at Gladstone. The ground falls away below the eastern side of the church and school and is supported by a stone retaining wall, which separates it from the large playground on the lower level and gives visual prominence to the eastern elevation of the church. The church is a Gothic influenced timber building, cruciform in plan, with gabled porches featuring decorative timber posts at the north, south and eastern arms. There is also an entry on the southern side. The foundations of the church are concrete and the gabled roof has a modern metal cladding with a louvred fleche at the crossing. The roof ends and porches are topped by timber Celtic crosses. The church has an octagonal sanctuary lit with two sets of triple lancet windows and two single lancet windows set with stained glass. There is a large sacristy to each side of the sanctuary. All windows are triple lancets in aluminium frames beneath arched drip moulds. A marble foundation stone is located at the base of the eastern elevation. The school is constructed of light red brick with a tiled roof. It has been constructed in three phases, the earliest of which is to the east and is three stories high. This first section is distinct from the additions and is the part of the school considered to have heritage significance. It has a hipped roof and features brick balconies and a tower containing the stair well, which s lit by glass panels. A marble foundation stone is also located in the stairwell tower on the eastern side. The extensions are sympathetic in form to the original school buildings and are two storeys high. They consist of a central section built in the 1970s and the section closest to the park was built in 1981.  Heritage listing  Our Lady Star of the Sea Church & School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The church and school of Our Lady Star of the Sea illustrate the development of Gladstone and the Roman Catholic Church in Queensland. The church is the only one in Gladstone that survived the 1949 cyclone and is now the only early building on this site. When the earliest section of the school was completed in 1949 it was said to have been the most modern in Queensland. This reflects the development that was taking place in Gladstone at the time and the confidence of the church in the future of Catholic education in the area. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Both buildings are prominently sited and in form, scale and materials make an important contribution to the built character of Gladstone. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Both buildings have a strong connection with the Roman Catholic community of Gladstone and the surrounding area over several generations. The school is probably a major work of Frank Cullen, the architect. The architect of the church is unknown.

It is derived from the Tata Kite project. The Tiago was previously announced as the Tata Zica, with \\"Zica\\" short for \\"zippy car\\", but it was changed because the launch of the car coincide with the outbreak of Zika virus. Tiago, a common Portuguese masculine name, was picked from suggestions solicited online. History Tata Tiago rear The Tata Tiago was born as the successor of the previous Tata Bolt, which was nothing but a heavy restyling of Tata Indica Vista. Like the Indica Vista, even the Bolt did not get the desired success and Tata began designing a completely new vehicle (Kite project) of a city car with 5-door body that could boost the sales of the brand in the Indian territory. The base platform was always the Tata X1 chassis that also adopted the previous Indica and Bolt but was heavily modified and shortened because with the new car Tata Motors wanted to lower the list price as well as the production costs. Also the engines were all new and the old Fiat 1.2 FIRE and 1.3 Multijet unit adopted by the previous models were abandoned. With the Tiago, Tata brings to its debut the Revotron and Revotorq three-cylinders designed together with Austria's AVL, a family of modular propellers designed to equip the entire range of the Indian manufacturer. The Tiago was 3.75 meters long, shorter than the old Tata Bolt, the body has 5 doors. From the Tiago has also been developed a sedan variant called Tata Tigor. The engines are the 1.2-liter Revotron three-cylinder 12V petrol that delivers 85 horsepower and 114 Nm of maximum torque combined with a 5-speed manual transmission or 6-speed automatic, the diesel is a 1.1-liter Revotorq three- cylinder common rail 12V 70 horsepower delivering 140 Nm of maximum torque, combined with a 5-speed manual transmission. The Tiago is produced only with right hand drive in Tata Motors Sanand plant and is not expected to be imported in Europe. In September 2018, Tata Motors launched the Tiago NRG in the Indian market, a crossover like trim with a 10 mm raised, raw plastic guards for the bumpers and sills, two-tone alloy wheels and a rear bumper shield. The Tiago NRG is sold with both 1.2 petrol and 1.05 diesel engines.  JTP version  In October 2018 Tata launched the Tiago JTP, a sporty version Tiago with 1.2 litre Revotron Turbo engine with max output of 114 PS of power which is 29 PS more than all the other versions. It was tuned by JT Special Vehicles or JTSV, a joint venture between Tata Motors and Coimbatore- based Jayem Automotives. According to Tata, the car can accelerate from 0-100 km/h under 10 seconds. There are also design changes which includes revised front grille, new bumper at front and dual exhaust pipe at the rear. Facelift (2020)  The face-lifted Tata Tiago was unveiled alongside the Tigor in 2020. It included cosmetic changes along with the BS6-complaint engine update.

SEM image of a campanile probe. False-color SEM image of the Campanile near-field probe fabricated on the edge of an optical fiber using nanoimprint. Comparison of photoluminescence maps recorded from a molybdenum disulfide flake using a campanile probe (top) and conventional confocal microscopy (bottom). Scale bars: 1 Œºm. In near-field scanning optical microscopy the campanile probe is a tapered optical probe with a shape of a campanile (a square pyramid). It is made of an optically transparent dielectric, typically silica, and its two facets are coated with a metal, typically gold. At the probe tip, the metal-coated facets are separated by a gap of a few tens of nanometers, which determines the spatial resolution of the probe. Such a probe design allows collecting optical signals, usually photoluminescence (PL) or Raman scattering, with a subwavelength resolution, breaking the diffraction limit. The campanile probe is attached to an optical fiber, which both provides a laser excitation of the studied sample and collects the measured signal. The probe is rastered over the sample with a standard scanning probe microscopy scanner, keeping the distance to the sample surface at a few nanometers. Contrary to the traditional (circular) near-field probes, the campanile probe has no cut-off frequency and is insensitive to the spatial mode of the optical near field. Hence its application is not limited to thin-film samples. Another advantage of the campanile probe is a high signal collection efficiency, which exceeds 90%. Campanile probes are typically fabricated as follows: a standard cylindrical single-mode optical fiber is etched with hydrofluoric acid to create a conical tip with a radius of ca. 100 nm. Then a square pyramid is carved on the tip using focused ion beam (FIB) milling, and its two facets are coated with a metal by shadow evaporation. A nanometer gap is the opened on the tip by FIB. Alternative fabrication method uses nanoimprint lithography to replicate campanile pyramid from a mold. This approach significantly increases fabrication speed.

It was proposed by Mechthild Stoer and Frank Wagner in 1995. The essential idea of this algorithm is to shrink the graph by merging the most intensive vertices, until the graph only contains two combined vertex sets. At each phase, the algorithm finds the minimum s-t cut for two vertices s and t chosen at its will. Then the algorithm shrinks the edge between s and t to search for non s-t cuts. The minimum cut found in all phases will be the minimum weighted cut of the graph. A cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two non- empty, disjoint subsets. A minimum cut is a cut for which the size or weight of the cut is not larger than the size of any other cut. For an unweighted graph, the minimum cut would simply be the cut with the least edges. For a weighted graph, the sum of all edges' weight on the cut determines whether it is a minimum cut. In practice, the minimum cut problem is always discussed with the maximum flow problem, to explore the maximum capacity of a network, since the minimum cut is a bottleneck in a graph or network.  Stoer‚ÄìWagner minimum cut algorithm  Let G=(V,E,w) be a weighted undirected graph. Suppose that s,t\\\\in V. The cut is called an s-t cut if exactly one of s or t is in S. The minimal cut of G that is also an s-t cut is called the s-t min-cut of G. This algorithm starts by finding an s and a t in V, and an s-t min-cut (S,T) of G. For any pair \\\\left\\\\\\\\{s,t\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, there are two possible situations: either (S,T) is a global min-cut of G, or s and t belong to the same side of the global min-cut of G. Therefore, the global min-cut can be found by checking the graph G/\\\\left\\\\\\\\{s,t\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, which is the graph after the merging of vertices s and t. During the merging, if s and t are connected by an edge then this edge disappears. If s and t both have edges to some vertex v, then the weight of the edge from the new vertex st to v is w(s,v)+w(t,v). The algorithm is described as: MinimumCutPhase(G,w,a) A\\\\gets\\\\left\\\\\\\\{a\\\\right\\\\\\\\} while \\\\ A e V add to A the most tightly connected vertex store the cut in which the last remaining vertex is by itself (the \\"cut-of-the-phase\\") and shrink G by merging the two vertices added last MinimumCut(G,w,a) while |V|>1 MinimumCutPhase(G,w,a) if the cut-of-the-phase is lighter than the current minimum cut then store the cut-of-the-phase as the current minimum cut The algorithm works in phases. In the MinimumCutPhase, the subset A of the graphs vertices grows starting with an arbitrary single vertex until A is equal to V. In each step, the vertex which is outside of A, but most tightly connected with A is added to the set A. This procedure can be formally shown as: add vertex z otin A such that w(A,z)=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{w(A,y\\\\mid y otin A)\\\\\\\\}, where w(A,y) is the sum of the weights of all the edges between A and y. So, in a single phase, a pair of vertices s and t , and a min s\\\\text{-}t cut C is determined. After one phase of the MinimumCutPhase, the two vertices are merged as a new vertex, and edges from the two vertices to a remaining vertex are replaced by an edge weighted by the sum of the weights of the previous two edges. Edges joining the merged nodes are removed. If there is a minimum cut of G separating s and t, the C is a minimum cut of G. If not, then the minimum cut of G must have s and t on a same side. Therefore, the algorithm would merge them as one node. In addition, the MinimumCut would record and update the global minimum cut after each MinimumCutPhase. After n-1 phases, the minimum cut can be determined.  Example  This section refers to Figs. 1‚Äì6 in the original paper The graph in step 1 shows the original graph G and randomly selects node 2 as the starting node for this algorithm. In the MinimumCutPhase, set A only has node 2, the heaviest edge is edge (2,3), so node 3 is added into set A. Next, set A contains node 2 and node 3, the heaviest edge is (3,4), thus node 4 is added to set A. By following this procedure, the last two nodes are node 5 and node 1, which are s and t in this phase. By merging them, the new graph is as shown in step 2. In this phase, the weight of cut is 5, which is the summation of edges (1,2) and (1,5). Right now, the first loop of MinimumCut is completed. In step 2, starting from node 2, the heaviest edge is (2,15), thus node 15 is put in set A. The next heaviest edges is (2,3) or (15,6), we choose (15,6) thus node 6 is added to the set. Then we compare edge (2,3) and (6,7) and choose node 3 to put in set A. The last two nodes are node 7 and node 8. Therefore, merge edge (7,8). The minimum cut is 5, so remain the minimum as 5. The following steps repeat the same operations on the merged graph, until there is only one edge in the graph, as shown in step 7. The global minimum cut has edge (2,3) and edge (6,7), which is detected in step 5.  Proof of correctness  To prove the correctness of this algorithm, we need to prove that the cut given by MinimumCutPhase is in fact a minimum s\\\\text{-}t cut of the graph, where s and t are the two vertices last added in the phase. Therefore, a lemma is shown below: > Lemma 1: MinimumCutPhase returns a minimum s\\\\text{-}t-cut of G. Let C=(X,\\\\overline{X}) be an arbitrary s\\\\text{-}t cut, and CP be the cut given by the phase. We must show that W(C)\\\\ge W(CP). Observe that a single run of MinimumCutPhase gives us an ordering of all the vertices in the graph (where a is the first and s and t are the two vertices added last in the phase). We say the vertex v is active if v and the vertex added just before v are in opposite sides of the cut. We prove the lemma by induction on the set of active vertices. We define A_v as the set of vertices added to A before v, and C_v to be the set of edges in C with both of their ends in A_v \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{v\\\\\\\\}, i.e. C_v \\\\subseteq C is the cut induced by A_v \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{v\\\\\\\\}. We prove, for each active vertex v, > w(A_v,v)\\\\le w(C_v) Let v_0 be the first active vertex. By the definition of these two quantities, w(A_{v_0},v_0) and w(C_{v_0}) are equivalent. A_{v_0} is simply all vertices added to A before v_0, and the edges between these vertices and v_0 are the edges that cross the cut C. Therefore, as shown above, for active vertices v and u, with v added to A before u: > w(A_u,u)=w(A_v,u)+w(A_u-A_v,u) > w(A_u,u)\\\\le w(C_v)+w(A_u-A_v,u) by induction, w(A_v,u)\\\\le w(A_v,v)\\\\le w(C_v) > w(A_{u},u)\\\\le w(C_{u}) since w(A_u-A_v,u) contributes to w(C_{u}) but not to > w(C_{v}) (and other edges are of non-negative weights) Thus, since t is always an active vertex since the last cut of the phase separates s from t by definition, for any active vertex t: > w(A_t,t)\\\\le w(C_t)=w(C) Therefore, the cut of the phase is at most as heavy as C.  Time complexity  The running time of the algorithm MinimumCut is equal to the added running time of the |V|-1 runs of MinimumCutPhase, which is called on graphs with decreasing number of vertices and edges. For the MinimumCutPhase, a single run of it needs at most O(|E|+|V|\\\\log|V|) time. Therefore, the overall running time should be the product of two phase complexity, which is O(|V||E|+|V|^2\\\\log|V|)[2]. For the further improvement, the key is to make it easy to select the next vertex to be added to the set A, the most tightly connected vertex. During execution of a phase, all vertices that are not in A reside in a priority queue based on a key field. The key of a vertex V is the sum of the weights of the edges connecting it to the current A, that is, w(A,v). Whenever a vertex v is added to A we have to perform an update of the queue. v has to be deleted from the queue, and the key of every vertex w not in A, connected to v has to be increased by the weight of the edge vw, if it exists. As this is done exactly once for every edge, overall we have to perform |VExtractMax and |EIncreaseKey operations. By using the Fibonacci heap we can perform an ExtractMax operation in O(\\\\log|V|) amortized time and an IncreaseKey operation in O(1) amortized time. Thus, the time we need for this key step that dominates the rest of the phase, is O(|E|+|V|\\\\log|V|).

It was built from 1929 to 1949. It is also known as PCD Factory and Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd Factory. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001.  History  The Port Curtis Dairy Company Ltd (the PCD) was formed at Gladstone in 1904, with its first timber factory buildings erected at Gladstone in 1906. By the 1920s, the PCD was one of the largest co-operative dairy companies in Queensland. The activities of the PCD at Gladstone and in surrounding districts stimulated the expansion of commercial dairying in Central Queensland. Statewide, dairying was an important economic activity for the first half of the 20th century, and a mainstay for farming communities during the economic depression of the early 1930s. Surviving elements of the Gladstone factory site include the 1929-1930 factory building, an early factory office building, several cold stores, a single-storeyed office building with two- storeyed extensions erected 1948-1950, a 1938 re-tinning shed, an ice shed and store room erected during the Second World War, and sections of a 1914 railway siding and 1923 siding extension. From the late 1880s, the Queensland government promoted the establishment of dairying in Queensland as a commercial, rather than subsistence, activity. The development of dairying as a staple industry was considered a means of relieving selector poverty and debt, and as encouragement to closer settlement of the land. The Meat and Dairy Produce Act 1893 was introduced to offer subsidies to dairy farmers and a tax on cattle, the latter funding the establishment of creameries, cheese and butter factories throughout Queensland. In 1895, Queensland produced its first butter surplus. The real catalyst for the establishment of commercial dairying proved to be the Agricultural Lands Purchase Act 1894, under which valuable agricultural land long freeholded by pastoralists was repurchased by the government, then offered as selections (mostly on perpetual lease) to agriculturalists. By the late 19th century, pastoralists could no longer afford to maintain huge freeholds, and were keen to relinquish land through repurchase. In the Gladstone district, the 1894 Act led to the opening of the Boyne Valley to selection and closer settlement, and this, combined with the provisions of the Meat and Dairy Produce Act 1893, ultimately led to the establishment of a meatworks (1896) and a butter factory (1906) at Gladstone. The Closer Settlement Act 1906 with its provisions for repurchase and on- selling to agriculturalists as settlement farm leases, led to a dairying boom in the Mount Larcom and Yarwun districts behind Gladstone. The Queensland government further supported agriculturalists with its establishment in 1901 of the Queensland Agricultural Bank, aimed at increasing the flow of credit to selectors, further stimulating the dairying industry. The Queensland Government also intervened to maintain and enhance standards within the dairying industry. In 1898 the government introduced compulsory grading of butter and cream, prohibiting the mixing of all states of cream (fresh, ripe and stale) in the same vat. The Dairy Produce Acts 1904-05 provided further quality control with the introduction of Government inspection of dairies and factories. In addition, Queensland's Margarine Act 1910 restricting the use of margarine, was aimed at protecting the local dairying industry. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the early Queensland dairy industry was its organisation along co-operative lines. The co-operative movement, established in Switzerland in the 1880s, gained worldwide popularity at the Second International Dairy Conference held in 1905, but Queensland farmers were experimenting with the concept from the 1890s. In the 1890s and early 1900s, Victorian \\"dairy immigrants\\" also brought ideas about co-operatives to Queensland. In November 1903, a public meeting was held at the Gladstone Town Hall to gauge local interest in forming a co-operative dairy company and erecting a dairy factory at Gladstone. Supported by graziers and selectors alike, a provisional committee was elected, representing Mount Larcombe, Calliope, Clyde Creek, Boyne River, Gladstone, Bororen, and Miriam Vale. The committee canvassed the district for support, soliciting shares and guarantees of milk supplies. As a result, the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was registered in Brisbane in September 1904 as a joint stock company, with the registered office situated in Gladstone. The company's objective was to erect a factory at Gladstone for the manufacture and storage of butter and other dairy products. During 1904 articles of association were drawn up, and a founding committee comprising prominent local graziers and businessmen was elected. A site for the dairy factory was selected adjacent to the railway line, a couple of blocks southeast of the main Gladstone railway station, and the scheme was approved by the Meat and Dairy Board. Tenders for the construction of a dairy factory (a timber structure) at Gladstone were called in June 1905 by Bundaberg architect Frederic Herbert Faircloth, with the contract let in August to J Connors. A dispute between the contractor and the dairy company delayed completion for several months, but finally the factory commenced butter production in April 1906. In 1914, Queensland Railways constructed a dead end siding for the PCD, which was extended in . The establishment of the butter factory at Gladstone provided local farmers with a steady income and stimulated the town economy. For example, the Queensland National Bank opened a branch at Gladstone in December 1905, and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney erected substantial new premises in the town in 1910-11 (Kullaroo House). During the 1910s dairying expanded in the surrounding districts, particularly at Mount Larcom and Bracewell, and the PCD made steady progress. Following the appointment in January 1916 of Joseph W Rigby as Manager and Secretary, the area from which the Company received cream was extended and the Company's growth was greatly accelerated. In the period 1916 to 1923, suppliers increased from 216 to 502 and manufactured butter from . Historian Lorna Macdonald (1988:170) suggests that during the 1920s the combination of Wilson (JL, of Calliope Station) as chairman, Rigby as manager, and RM Hill of Bororen who was elected to the board in 1924 made the PCD one of the largest co-operative organisations in Queensland. JW Rigby remained as manager until November 1931. By the mid-1920s, the Company was expanding at a substantial rate. Under the provisions of the Primary Producers' Co-operative Associations Act 1923, in order to continue to use the word \\"co-operative\\", the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Company Ltd was de-registered under the Companies Act 1863 to 1913, and in February 1925 was re-registered under the 1923 Act as the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd. In the same year the PCD erected its own cold stores at Gladstone, with storage capacity for of butter. This obviated the heavy costs of railage to Brisbane, as well as Brisbane cold storage charges, and reduced loss in quality during transit to Brisbane. As a consequence, a higher grade of export butter, and direct overseas shipment of butter from Gladstone, were made possible. The installation of coldstores at the PCD's Gladstone factory had important long- term effects for the Port of Gladstone, where butter formed the staple export from 1926 to 1934, prior to the first chilled beef (distinct from frozen beef) being exported in 1935. From the mid-1920s the PCD led the way in consolidating the dairying industry in central Queensland, from just south of Bundaberg to Bowen in the north, and inland to Monto, Biloela and Wowan. Consolidation commenced in July 1927 when the recently established Central Queensland Dairy Co-operative Ltd, based at Rockhampton, (and which had already absorbed Mount Larcom & District Co-operative Dairy & Produce Co., established 1921), amalgamated with the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd. The amalgamation was conditional on the PCD erecting a dairy factory at Rockhampton, which commenced operation in January 1928. Further negotiations resulted in the absorption of the Bundaberg Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd, whose factory at Bundaberg operated as a branch of the Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd from 1 March 1928. From 1 April 1928 the Dawson Valley Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd's factory at Wowan operated as a branch of the PCD. Following the opening of the Upper Burnett River to closer settlement in the 1920s, the PCD established a butter factory at Monto in 1929, stimulating a phenomenal expansion of dairying and pig- raising in that district. In the same year the PCD installed a buttermilk drying plant at Gladstone, the powdered buttermilk sold back to dairy farmers for fowl, pig and calf rearing. This proved a popular side-line, and in 1933 the PCD installed a plant at Gladstone for converting buttermilk into a buttermilk curd. The PCD closed its Gladstone factory on 1 July 1929 for re- building purposes, re-opening early in February 1930 to handle cream only, and was fully operational by September 1930. The 1905-06 building appears to have been demolished at this time, replaced with the present main factory building. The 1929-30 factory contained the PCD's first laboratory. Port Curtis Co- operative Dairy Association Ltd., Mackay, 1937 In addition to the substantial re-building of its Gladstone factory, the PCD opened a new factory in Mackay in March 1930, following the absorption of the Mackay District Co-operative Butter Factory Association Ltd by the PCD in 1929-30. Dairying proved to be the economic mainstay of many Queensland farming communities, including those of central Queensland, during the depression years of the early 1930s. Pig and calf raising became important adjuncts to the dairying industry, utilising skim milk and later buttermilk from the factories, as stock feed. By the second half of 1934, the increased quantity of butter available for export necessitated the construction of additional cold stores at Gladstone, on land leased from Queensland Railways adjacent to the PCD factory. These commenced operation in January 1935. (This building was demolished s.) The PCD continued to expand its activities in central Queensland in the second half of the 1930s. In 1937 a dairy factory and buttermilk stud stock piggery (carrying capacity 500 pigs) were opened at Biloela in the Callide Valley. Another PCD buttermilk stud stock piggery, with a carrying capacity of 700 pigs, was opened at Monto in February 1938. In November 1938 the PCD installed a plant at the Gladstone factory for the re-tinning of cream cans, which proved popular with farmers. PCD butter production peaked in 1938‚Äì1939 with . About 1938 a single-storeyed administrative building was erected south of the main factory building, and in May 1939 a contract was let to J Hutchinson for additional cold stores, capable of storing 40,000 boxes of butter, at the PCD's Gladstone factory. These were operational by October 1940, giving the factory a holding capacity of 65,000 boxes of butter. The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 had a substantial impact on the operations of the PCD. Cheese factories were established at Bracewell (in operation May 1942 - 31 December 1954) and Theodore (in operation July 1942 - 31 January 1951), to meet requests from the British Government for extra cheese supplies. The processing of pasteurised milk at PCD factories was initiated with the arrival of United States troops at Rockhampton in 1942 as the American military authorities did not approve the use of raw milk. At the Gladstone factory a number of new structures were erected, including an ice shed and store to the east of the PCD siding, both of which remain in situ. During the war all surplus butter was bought by the Commonwealth Government, but the war- time shortage of refrigerated ships necessitated the construction of emergency cold stores throughout Australia, to store accumulated butter supplies. Gladstone was chosen by the Australian Dairy Produce Control Board as a centre for an emergency cold store for butter and meat, and in 1941-42 a timber cold store was erected there for this purpose In 1946 the PCD purchased the Emergency Stores for a fraction of its original cost, and leased it to Swifts Meatworks for storing meat. Central Queensland dairy production peaked in the decade 1940-1950, with the PCD providing 28% of all butter exported from Queensland and 10% of the total Australian butter exports. During this period the PCD achieved its greatest diversification with production of butter, cheese, pasteurised milk and ice-cream (after the purchase of Pauls Ice Cream and Milk Ltd factory in Rockhampton in 1945). Facilities for ice cream holding and distribution were established by the PCD at Bundaberg, Gladstone, Mackay and Monto in 1946‚Äì47, and in 1948 a complete ice cream manufacturing plant was erected at Mackay for the PCD. In the immediate post-war years the PCD obtained the franchise for pasteurised milk in Rockhampton and established co- operative stores at Gladstone (on PCD land adjacent to the dairy factory, 1949), Biloela, Wowan and Monto, in converted surplus Army Storage Sheds acquired from Eidsvold and Stanwell. In this period the PCD also acquired a half interest in Central Queensland Co-operative Stock Feeds. In 1947 an attempt to shift PCD headquarters to Rockhampton was defeated and in January 1948 a tender of from John Young and Sons was accepted for the construction of a new PCD Head Office at the Gladstone factory (an extension of the administration building). In December 1949 it was decided to add a second storey to the new office building, at a cost of about . From the 1950s dairying in the Gladstone hinterland declined in favour of beef cattle and tropical fruit, and the PCD, following a national trend, turned to bulk milk rather than butter production, establishing milk pasteurising facilities and a bottling plant at its Gladstone factory in 1955‚Äì57. The factory building was refurbished to accommodate milk processing to meet codes of practice and included the introduction of a lower ceiling in the milk processing room and the re-finishing of the floor. Milk from the dairies was transported to the site by road and by rail. It was received at the northern end of the factory, whereupon the cans were weighed, milk was checked for freshness, sample cups were taken from each supplier and daily cream dockets were issued. The cans were placed upon a conveyor which tipped the milk into troughs and milk was strained into vats. The cans went to the can washer where they were cold rinsed, caustic washed, hot washed and steamed dried before being returned to the supplier for removal. The milk was centrifugally tested and pasteurised in the with the salt hole and pump house on the site providing the water for the vacuum before being bottled and then transported by conveyor to the stores. The PCD's Gladstone factory continued its milk pasteurising and bottling operation until it closed . For some years afterwards, the Gladstone Maritime Museum was housed in the former company administration building, and a number of small businesses leased space in the former factory buildings. In October 1994 the Port Curtis Dairy Co-operative Association Ltd was absorbed by Paul's Ltd (Queensland United Food Industries), which sold the former Gladstone PCD factory in the late 1990s. In 2015, the former administration building is leased to Anglicare as their Gladstone Family Resource Centre, while the former factory remains vacant. The site was advertised for freehold sale in November 2015, noting that \\"plans [had] been drawn to refurbish the existing [factory] building and create five separate tenancies\\".  Description  The Port Curtis Co-Operative Dairy Factory is a complex of buildings located on a site that rises from the reclaimed flats of Barney Point up a rise to the eastern side of a cutting along the north-south railway line. The site is bounded to the north and east by a large vacant freehold property owned by Queensland Rail, to the south by Young Street and to the west by railway reserve. The administration building is situated on the highest point of the site in the south-western corner adjacent to the railway bridge over Young Street. The building is divided into two sections. Adjacent to Young Street the single storey rendered masonry section has articulated engaged piers to its southern elevation, a hipped corrugated iron roof surmounted by two small ventilators, quad guttering, later sliding aluminium windows and boarded soffits in line with the rafters. The two storey rendered masonry section attached along its northern also has a hipped corrugated iron roof and quad guttering but has a flat soffit with timber cover strips and no evidence of articulated piers. It has a rendered masonry string course below the window line. The windows comprise groups of six top hung sashes to the western elevation with later aluminium sliding windows generally throughout the remainder of the building. The butter stores are located between the Administration building and the butter factory to the north. The butter stores are in four parts. There is a two-storey wing along the western end which has a despatch/loading area at the excavated platform level of the factory and staff amenities on the upper level which aligns with the ground floor level of the Administration Building. This section has a gabled corrugated fibrous cement roof and metal framed double hung windows - larger openings have fixed sidelights. The stores are divided into three bays and are located at right angles to and are attached to the eastern wall of the dispatch wing. Two of the bays (to the south) have external wall of concrete frame and infill construction with corrugated fibrous cement gable roofs surmounted by pairs of large ventilators. The gable ends are lined with flat fibrous cement sheeting with timber cover battens and house louvred vents below which a suspended fibrous cement awning provides protection to several large doors which open onto a platform. The third bay to the north is of a similar form but of different construction. It has a corrugated iron roof and appears to have corrugated iron clad walls and steel framed windows. The butter factory originally housed the laboratory, boiler house, engine room, vacuators and butter processing areas following which it accommodated the milk bottling plant. The factory is a large two-storey volume building of concrete frame and infill external wall construction supporting a steel framed roof. The building is divided into two bays with corrugated iron gabled roofs. Gabled roof clerestoreys running the length of each bay provide natural light and ventilation together with steel framed multipaned centrally pivotting windows in the eastern end elevation. A third ventilated gabled roof supported on a steel frame is attached along the northern end of the building providing protection for a receiving/loading area. The tops of the clerestoreys are visible from the west above the large concrete framed facade which faces the city and railway line and prominently displays the Port Curtis Co-Operative Dairy name and insignia. The infill panels are omitted at ground level on western facade providing access to a platform adjacent to which are remains of part of the railway siding. The railway siding comprised two tracks which entered the site near the south-eastern end across Young Street. These tracks converged at the northern end of the butter stores curving around the northern end of the factory and exiting to the main railway line at the north western end of the site. A spur off this siding returned around the factory along its western face. Sections of the track survive near the Young Street boundary, at the rear of the butter stores and to the west of the factory. The factory office, relocated to the north of the factory from its original location to the west of the siding, is a timber framed building, lowset on stumps with timber top hung sash windows and a flat fibrous cement wall cladding with timber cover strips. It has a corrugated iron gambrel roof with eaves extended over the south-west elevation. The ice room and store are located to the north east of the factory. The ice room is a two-storey, timber framed volume with hipped corrugated iron roof. It has timber battens surrounding the base above which the walls are lined with vertical corrugated iron sheeting. Adjacent to the ice room is a store room which is a single storey volume with a hipped corrugated fibrous cement roof and wall clad in vertical corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. The tin shed is located toward the north eastern end of the site and is a single storey building clad in vertical corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. It has a gambrel roof with a ventilated ridge and later metal doors and gablet detailing to its eastern end. A water hole survives in the north eastern portion of the site and may be the salt hole from which water was drawn to form a vacuum in the pasteurisation process at the factory.

The procedure is symmetrical and is robust in the presence of one or few outliers. The Passing- Bablok procedure fits the parameters a and b of the linear equation y = a + b x using non-parametric methods. The coefficient b is calculated by taking the shifted median of all slopes of the straight lines between any two points, disregarding lines for which the points are identical or b = -1. The median is shifted based on the number of slopes where b < -1 to create an unbiased estimator. The parameter a is calculated by a = median { yi \\\\- b xi }. Passing and Bablok define a method for calculating a 95% confidence interval for both a and b in their original paper, though bootstrapping the parameters is the preferred method for in vitro diagnostics (IVD) when using patient samples. The Passing-Bablok procedure is valid only when a linear relationship exist between x and y, which can be assessed by a cusum test. The results are interpreted as follows. If 0 is in the CI of a, and 1 is in the CI of b, the two methods are comparable within the investigated concentration range. If 0 is not in the CI of a there is a systematic difference and if 1 is not in the CI of b then there is a proportional difference between the two methods. However, the use of Passing-Bablok regression in method comparison studies has been criticized because it ignores random differences between methods.

The first time director‚Äôs screenplay is straightforward, allowing everyone to become enamoured by the characters.\\" Archana Nathan of The Hindu compared the plot of the film to a 1999 Malayalam film, Niram, and wrote, \\"Interestingly, despite its unoriginal plot line, Kaviraj‚Äôs film makes for an entertaining watch. And the credit for this goes to the cast, especially the combination of Ananth Nag and Achyuth Kumar and their characterisation.\\" Shyam Prasad S. of Bangalore Mirror commended the comic scenes in the films and of the acting performances of Nag and Kumar, he wrote, \\"Anant Nag and Achyuth are beyond compare. Their presence and acting is very life-like...\\" He concluded writing, \\"High standards of production keep the film colourful and glossy throughout. The attention to detail makes up for the grandeur of cinematic commercialism.\\" The reviewer for Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5/5, called it a \\"simplest story with an effective narration\\" and wrote of the acting performances, \\"Ananth Nag, Achyuth Kumar and Amulya with her bullet riding avatar are the entertaining pillars in terms of performances, but for the debut hero Suraj, he definitely needs to learn from the scratch, be it acting, expression or even dancing\\". Sunayana Suresh of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 as well, and said of Kaviraj's direction in the film that it had the \\"soulful touch\\" of directors Basu Chatterjee, Sai Paranjpye and Hrishikesh Mukherjee and a \\"dash of the youth\\" from Karan Johar, Sooraj Barjatya and Aditya Chopra. She felt that the film had \\"rich production values\\", and concluded writing praises of the acting and the technical departments. S. Viswanath of Deccan Herald rated the film two out of five and wrote, \\"Though no great shakes, the film follows the formula to ensure that the audiences get their money‚Äôs worth.\\" He praised the performances of Nag and Kumar, and felt that the \\"film‚Äôs music score and lyrics [of the soundtrack] of Kaviraj\\" was a \\"downer\\".

They are among the oldest known African Iron Age artworks from South of the equator. Other artefacts found in association with these heads include ceramic vessels, iron and copper beads, and bone fragments. Charcoal associated with the heads was radiocarbon dated, and this relative dating technique places these artefacts and the site at around 1410 BP (approximately 500 A.D.), which constitutes one of the earliest dates for an Iron Age settlement in South Africa. The heads are hollow with thin clay strips added to create facial details. The skill and thought that went into the designs suggest that they were valued products of a well organized and settled community.  Discovery  The heads were discovered initially as a surface find by a young boy named Ludwig Von Bezing while playing on his father's farm. The material was later collected when Ludwig was a teenager. He went back in both 1962 and 1966 to excavate the area and during this time he was able to find several pieces of pottery that proved to be seven hollow heads when assembled, two of which can fit over a child's head; only one out of the seven heads resembles an animal.  Artifacts  One of seven ceramic heads found near Lydenburg The recovered pottery shards were reconstructed largely at the University of Cape Town, and assembled into two large heads and five smaller heads. One of the larger heads constitute an incomplete specimen. The reconstructed heads provide a glimpse into the craftsmen's skill and preciseness of artistry, even though they may not look exactly how they looked 1500 years ago. Six of the heads share human characteristics, while a single head has animal-like features. The presence of linear patterned neck rings are postulated to represent a marker of prosperity or wealth, due to their symbolic use throughout time. Of the seven, only two are large enough to have been worn, but the size is not the only observable variation between them. The two aforementioned heads constitute the only specimens with small animal figurines, perceived to be lions, mounted on top of them. The other five are more similar in size and appearance, with one exception. This head is the only head that seems to resemble something other than a human. It has a long snout instead of regular protruding lips and also has no ears. Documentation of associated artefacts was limited due to the primary significance of the heads; however, we do know that the associated pottery sherds were identified as terracotta. These heads are speculated to have been covered in white slip, and glittering specularite at the time of their use. The smaller heads, #3‚Äì7 have small perforations on their sides. These perforations may have been some sort of framework to be worn as a headdress, or some part of a significant structure. Characteristics The heads share a basic pot like formation with subtle differences in the way they were each shaped. The base formed at the bottom of all the heads was completed like the rim of a pot. Parts of the rim are rounded, however some parts of the base reflects a flat squared shape. While the Basal rings may be incised or moulded the neck rings above these basal rings contain diagonally incised rings that circle the entire neck. The incised pattern constitutes hatch marks that alternate in direction producing a herringbone pattern. While the specimens are similar in manufacture, they also have varying characteristics. Some specimens are better preserved than others, as in the case of the ears. The ears were all manufactured in the same way. A plate of clay was moulded to the side of the specimen where the ear would be anatomically. The outer edge of the ears were rounded and sloped down and slightly forward. Ear lobes are not presented in any of the specimens however there is a small peg of clay placed above the area where the ear attached to the head. This clay peg is postulated to represent the cartilaginous projection usually found in the a normal human ear. Each head features similar notched ridges made by applying wet strips of clay and incising lines before the clay had dried. These notches vary in position and shape along the face. Other similar features include the eyes, mouth and nose; these characteristics are detailed below. Head #1 The basal neck rings are moulded on this head. The mouth is located directly above the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks. The lips are open approximately 10mm. The lips have been cut completely through to the face which constitutes an open mouth that includes no teeth. The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes are made by slits cut through to the wall of the faced. The left and right ears are intact. There are three horizontal notched ridges on the face located one above the other. One notched ridge is found between the eyes running vertical. Two sets of horizontal notches are located towards the side of the face placed between the outer eye socket and the placement of the ears. The horizontal ridges found below the placement of the eyes are not notched, they constitute smooth raised ridges. This is the only head with smooth ridges. Above the crown outlining the edge of the face are groupings of clay studs. These features are only seen in this head specifically and portions of Head No. 2 Head #2 This head is too fragmented for precise characteristic recording. The basal neck rings are moulded. The mouth is located directly above the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks. The lips have been cut completely through to the face which constitutes an open mouth that includes no teeth. The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes are made by slits cut through to the wall of the faced. The left ear is intact. The ridges on this head are similar to those in Head No. 1 excepet the horizontal ridges below the eyes are incised with notches and not smooth. There are two vertical ridges with incised notches located between the eyes and extend toward the upper most portion of the forehead. There is a grouping of several applied clay studs on one of the pieces that constitute this head as seen in Head No. 1 Head #3 Head # 3 has perforations that measure approximately 5 mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings. The basal neck rings are incised. The mouth is within the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks. The lips are open approximately 5 mm. Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps. There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth. The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. The left ear is intact. This head has three horizontal ridges with incised lines between the eyes. A single ridge extending towards the forehead is also notched and curves toward the left side of the face. There are single notched ridges extending from the eye to the top part of the ear on both sides of the head. Below these, a notched ridge extends horizontally across the cheek to the bottom of the ear. Head #4 This head has perforations that measure approximately 5 mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings. The basal neck rings are insiced. The mouth is within the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks. The lips are open approximately 5 mm. Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps. There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth. The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. The left and right ears are intact. The notched ridges in this specimen are similar to Head # 3 except the ridge on the right side of the face extending across the cheek is not intact. Head #5 This head has perforations that measure approximately 5 mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings. The basal neck rings are incised. This head has the only example of cross hatching on the neck. The mouth is within the upper neck ring. Two crescent shaped pieces of clay were joined at the edges to form the lips which then taper into the cheeks. The lips are open approximately 5 mm. Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps. There is a large gap depicted between the two front teeth. The eyes are placed in the middle of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. There are three horizontal notched ridges between the eyes. The orientation of notched ridges are similar to Heads No. 2, #3, and No. 4. All Ridges on face are notched. The vertical notched ridge extends in a straight line from the middle eye ridges across the forehead; unlike the previous mentioned heads whose forehead ridges curve to one side of the head. Head #6 This head has perforations that measure approximately 5 mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings. The basal neck rings are inciesed. The mouth is missing in this specimen. The eyes are placed towards the lower portion of the face. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. The right eye is missing. The left ear is intact. The ridge patterning on the face is similar to Heads No. 2, #3, and No. 4. This includes three incised ridges running horizontal between the eyes, one ridge running horizontal from the outer corner of the eye to the top of the ear, on both sides; and one notched ridge extending across the cheek to the bottom of the ear on both sides of the face. The major difference in this specimen is that the single, vertical, notched-ridge extending from the middle of the eye ridges across the forehead, curves to the right of the face. Head #7 This head has perforations that measure approximately 5 mm in diameter on both sides of the neck toward the lower portion of the hatched rings. The basal neck rings are incised. The mouth appears as a protruding snout, that has a downward slope which flares out over the upper most neck ring. Teeth were made by inserting clay pegs between the lip gaps. There is a large gap depicted between the two left side teeth. This specimen represents a differing morphology compared to the other six heads. The face of this specimen was created to bulge outwards and down wards with the nose being set low towards the exaggerated lips. The positioning of the lips and nose give this head the appearance of an animal snout. The eyes were made by cutting into applied pieces of clay. This head does not have ears like the other specimens. The notched ridges on this head Varies widely from the previous specimens. Where the other heads share three notched ridges between the eyes, this specimen has a long notched ridge extending from the protruding mouth vertically between the eyes towards the forehead which then curves to the left side of the face. Like the other heads Head No. 7 had horizontal notched ridges extending from the outer corner of the eyes, but these ridges slope downward to the bottom of where ears would be positioned. There are no horizontal ridges running across the cheek as in the other specimens.  Speculative purpose  Fragments of domestic pottery from the site with similar decoration to the Lydenburg heads The current speculation surrounding the Lydenburg Heads is that they may have been created to serve ritualistic and or ceremonial purposes including initiation rights. The two larger specimens could have been worn by a small individual such as young man. If so, these heads may represent a significant point in a boy's life such as becoming a man, or ceremonial purposes like memorialising an ancestor. The five smaller heads have holes in their sides which some archaeologists suggest may have been used to connected them to something at the time of their use. The marks across the foreheads and between the eyes are postulated to represent scarification marks, a widely practice behaviour in Africa. However, no evidence of scarification is seen practised within the modern descendants of those who manufactured the heads. Researchers suggest that the heads may not have been just disposed of but purposely buried, or destroyed at the conclusion of a specified ceremony, which may indicate their significance. These heads may be a result of ceremonial ritual or aggrandizement of significant ancestors. The heads show charicteristics of several different groups throughout the continent including; The Bantu, The Ndebele, and The Bini.

He ended the War on death row. At the outbreak of World War II, the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) had some 1700 members in Nazi Germany, divided into three provinces: Eastern, Lower and Upper Germany. Nazi leaders had some admiration for the discipline of the Jesuit order, but opposed its principles. Of the 152 Jesuits murdered by the Nazis across Europe, 27 died in captivity or its results, and 43 in the concentration camps.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; p.33 & Appendix A Hitler was anticlerical and had particular disdain for the Jesuits. The Jesuit Provincial, Augustin Rosch, ended the war on death row for his role in the July Plot to overthrow Hitler. The Catholic Church faced persecution in Nazi Germany and persecution was particularly severe in Poland. The Superior General of the Jesuits at the outbreak of War was Wlodzimierz Ledochowski, a Pole. Vatican Radio, which spoke out against Axis atrocities, was run by the Jesuit Filippo Soccorsi.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; pp.266-267 Jesuits made up the largest contingent of clergy imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp, where some 30 Jesuits died.

Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 196 According to historians Kershaw, Bullock, Evans, Fest, Phayer, Shirer and others, Hitler eventually hoped to eradicate Christianity in Germany. *Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547: Evans writes that Hitler believed that in the long run National Socialism and religion would not be able to co-exist, and stressed repeatedly that Nazism was a secular ideology, founded on modern science: \\"Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition\\". Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and \\"Priests, he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'\\". * Alan Bullock; Hitler: A Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p 219: \\"Once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect.\\" * Michael Phayer; The Response of the German Catholic Church to National Socialism, published by Yad Vashem: \\"By the latter part of the decade of the Thirties, church officials were well aware that the ultimate aim of Hitler and other Nazis was the total elimination of Catholicism and of the Christian religion.

In early 1937 he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the \\"primacy of the state\\", railing against any compromise with \\"the most horrible institution imaginable\\". Hitler biographer Alan Bullock wrote that though Hitler was raised as a Catholic, and retained some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism, he had utter contempt for its central teachings which he said, if taken to their conclusion, \\"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure.\\"Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218\\" Richard J.

According to Lapomarda, there was \\"no doubt\\" about the Jesuit Superior General Ledochowski's concern to thwart the Germans in Europe once they had invaded Poland, \\"Even if he had at one time entertained, as alleged by one historian, the conception of a union of a Catholic bloc in Europe against the Communists in the East and the Protestants in the West, events had dramatically altered that vision.\\" Wlodimir Led√≥chowski accurately surmised Hitler's perfidious nature, and predicted the Hitler-Stalin Pact, and he used the Jesuit-run Vatican Radio service to broadcast condemnations of Nazi crimes in Poland, that led to German Government protests and assisted underground resistance movements in occupied Europe.Vincent A.

Jesuits and the Resistance Rupert Mayer The Blessed Rupert Mayer SJ was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1939. The Blessed Rupert Mayer, a Bavarian Jesuit and World War I army chaplain, had clashed with the National Socialists as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler's rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to Ettal Abbey, but Meyer died in 1945.

With the Nazi Empire close to its full extent in late 1942, the Nazis sought to extend their roundups of Jews. In Lyon, in Vichy France, Cardinal Gerlier had defiantly refused to hand over Jewish children being sheltered in Catholic homes, and on September 9 it was reported in London that Vichy French authorities had ordered the arrest of all Catholic priests sheltering Jews in the unoccupied zone. Eight Jesuits were arrested for sheltering hundreds of children on Jesuit properties.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p.451 Two thirds of the 300,000 Jews living in France at the outbreak of war survived the Nazi Holocaust.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.251 The majority of French Jews survived the occupation, in large part thanks to the help received from Catholics and Protestants, who protected them in convents, boarding schools, presbyteries and families.http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20686.pdf The Amiti√©s Chr√©tiennes organisation operated out of Lyon to secure hiding places for Jewish children. Among its members was the Jesuit Pierre Chaillet.Jewish Rescue Operations in Belgium and France; by Lucien Steinberg; published by Yad Vashem The influential French Jesuit theologian Henri de Lubac was active in the resistance to Nazism and to antisemitism. He along with Pierre Chaillet assisted in the publication of T√©moinage chr√©tien.

The Superior General of the worldwide Jesuit order at the outbreak of war was Wlodzimierz Ledochowski, a Pole. The Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland was particularly severe. Vincent Lapomarda wrote that Ledochowski helped \\"stiffen the general attitude of the Jesuits against the Nazis\\" and that he permitted Vatican Radio to carry on its campaign against the Nazis in Poland. Vatican Radio was run by the Jesuit Filippo Soccorsi and spoke out against Nazi oppression ‚Äì particularly with regard to Poland and to Vichy-French antisemitism. Hitler's plans for the Germanization of the East saw no place for the Christian churches.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London p.661 Nazi policy towards the Church was at its most severe in the territories it annexed to Greater Germany, where the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Church ‚Äì arresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered. Jesuit-run Vatican Radio reported in November 1940 that religious life for Catholics in Poland had been brutally restricted and that at least 400 clergy had been deported to Germany in the preceding four months.The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 49‚Äì50 Among the Nazi crimes against Catholics in Poland was the massacre in the Jesuit residence on Rakowiecka Street in Warsaw (1944). Among the most significant Polish Jesuits to survive the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp was Adam Koz≈Çowiecki, who later served as a Cardinal. He was arrested as a young priest at the Jesuit College in Krak√≥w in 1939, and remained imprisoned until April 1945. He later wrote his recollections of his time at Dachau, where the highest percentage among incarcerated clergy were Jesuits.

The Netherlands Indies Government Information Service (NIGIS) was a civil secret service and propaganda organisation based in Australia, during and after World War II. NIGIS was affiliated with the Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service (NEFIS) and the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). Conrad Helfrich, commander of Dutch forces in the Netherlands East Indies, attempted to have NIGIS merged with NEFIS, for which he had responsibility. Helfrich's attempts were resisted by Hubertus van Mook, acting Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, who wished NIGIS to retain its civil status rather than be absorbed by the military apparatus. The service was established in April 1942, and was based in Melbourne, on the tenth floor of the Temple Court building at 422 Collins Street. In July 1944, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands decreed that a government in exile be established at Camp Columbia, a former United States Army camp located in Wacol, Queensland. The Melbourne-based agencies NIGIS, NEFIS and NICA all moved to Wacol to support the new administration. Divisions and operations NIGIS operated an English language radio service to monitor radio reports from the Netherlands East Indies during the Japanese occupation, and to broadcast \\"messages of hope\\" to residents of the colony living under Japanese rule. From 1942 to 1945, NIGIS produced an Indonesian language newspaper called Penjoeloeh (Indonesian for \\"Torch\\"). The paper was produced, written and translated by Indonesian former internees of the Boven- Digoel prison camp. The service also produced a Dutch language journal called Oranje. The service also employed special correspondents to write articles for the press, many of which were published verbatim in Australian newspapers. Correspondents such as Wolfe Preger for The Cairns Post wrote tales of Dutch bravery and Japanese villainy, as well as keeping Australian readers apprised of events in Europe, such as the Dutch resistance's acts of sabotage against the occupying Nazis. NIGIS operated a film and photographic unit. The unit was linked with the Australian production company Southern Seas Productions headed by Fred Daniell and his son, cameraman John Daniell. Southern Seas produced several commissions for NIGIS, including the film Indonesian Harmony. Directors of NIGIS included administrator Charles van der Plas and naval spokesman Huibert Quispel. Indonesian independence After the end of the war and the surrender of the Japanese, NIGIS turned its focus to asserting Dutch sovereignty over the newly proclaimed independent Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution. NIGIS and its sister agencies claimed that the Netherlands supported Indonesian independence, however promoted the line in Australia that the Republic of Indonesia was a \\"Quisling Japanese-sponsored government\\". When Australian maritime trade unions blockaded the Dutch shipping fleet in Australia in what was called the \\"Black Armada\\", NIGIS produced and distributed pamphlets claiming that the supplies to Indonesia were humanitarian in nature, and were not military materiel and personnel intended to suppress the independence movement.

Her most important discovery was the 1887 identification of the fungus Colletotrichum gossypii as the cause of cotton cankers, a disease which killed thousands of acres of cotton and was a major economic threat. She taught botany at several institutions, worked at the Desert Botanical Laboratory with her husband, and established the Botany Department Herbarium at the University of Southern California. Life Effie Southworth was born in North Collins, New York, on October 29, 1860, to parents Chloe and Nathaniel Southworth. Southworth was well educated and through her college years she studied foreign languages, mathematics, zoology, chemistry, astronomy, physics, geology, botany, and physiology. She studied at Allegheny College for one year before transferring to the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1885. In 1895, she married botanist Volney Morgan Spalding, a professor at the University of Michigan. After her husband was diagnosed with tuberculosis, they moved from Arizona to California where he died in 1918. In 1922, at the age of 65, she received her master's degree in botany from University of Southern California. Southworth died on April 1947, in Los Angeles at the age of 87. Career In 1885, Southworth became an instructor of botany at Bryn Mawr College. During her two years at the college, she also joined the botanical laboratory as a Fellow, worked on the anatomical structure of plants, and was able to understand the development of the fungus Asteroma. In 1887, she became known as the first female researcher to be hired by the Section of Mycology of the USDA. There, she worked as an assistant mycologist with Erwin F. Smith and Beverly T. Galloway and became involved in the study of fungal pathogens. As an assistant mycologist, she was responsible for preparing mycological publications on deceases that were causing a huge impact on the economy. In 1888, she began to study a decease that was destroying cotton farms. Three years later (1891), her major contribution to USDA was when she discovered that the fungus Colletotrichum gossypii was the reason why thousands of acres of cotton where being destroyed yearly. She left the USDA in 1892 to become an assistant in botany professor at Barnard College in New York. From 1905 to 1911 she worked as her husband's assistant at the Desert Botanical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Tucson, Arizona. Southworth here focused more on desert plants than plant diseases. After her husband's death she joined the botany faculty of University of Southern California. There, she founded the Herbarium of the Department of Botany in 1922, which focused primarily on California spermatophytes. She is commemorated in the fungal genus Southworthia Ellis & Galloway.

A principal focus of his research is in the area of major medical implants. Between 1990 and 1992 he served, in succession to Werner Scheler, as the final president of the (East) German Academy of Sciences. In 1992 he was relieved of his professorship at Rostock University \\"on account of personality defects\\" (\\"wegen mangelnder pers√∂nl. Eignung\\"). There is a view, to which he himself subscribes, that after 1990 his career suffered from the perception that he had been too close to the political establishment in East Germany. Early life Horst Klinkmann was born and grew up in Teterow, a small town near Rostock in northern Germany. His father was killed in the war which broke out when he was 4, and his mother died when he was 10. After this he was taken in by a local orphanage. In 1954 he entered the school of medicine at the University of Rostock, receiving his doctorate in 1959. Between 1960 and 1966, he continued with higher level medical studies at Rostock's Physiology Institute, also undertaking studies at the Semmelweis University in Budapest, where his interest in kidney function was encouraged by a Professor B√°lint, and at the Kidney Clinic in Lund, Sweden. His habilitation followed in 1969. Career in East Germany Between 1969 and 1971 Klinkmann was a visiting research professor at the University of Utah. In 1974 he became Director for Internal Medicine at Rostock University, a position he held for almost twenty years. In 1982 he was elected a corresponding member of the (East) German Academy of Sciences, becoming a full member in 1986 and, in 1990, the academy's last president. East German political activity In 1974, he joined East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED). Between 1984 and 1989 he served as a member of the party's district leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in Rostock. He was a chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the East German Health Ministry. Reports also emerged later that during the 1980s he had passed personal information on colleagues to the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi). Research into the archives indicated that from 1968 he had been identified in Stasi files under the code name \\"Informal Collaborator Ludwig\\" (\\"IM Ludwig\\"). His evident travel privileges reflected his international eminence, but there are indications that his cultivation of the political establishment was also helpful in this regard. However, the Stasi files also disclose that by the 1980s he was regarded as unreliable by his handlers because he had failed to provide adequate disclosure of private contacts made during his trips abroad, and after 1987 his career as an informant was officially deemed to be over. Post-reunification career Following reunification Klinkmann's reputation was tarnished in some quarters by his close association with the political rulers of the discredited East German political regime. He was relieved of his professorship at Rostock University in 1992. Though damaged, his academic career and reputation survived the criticism and more recently appear to have outlasted many of the critics. Between 1992 and 1994 Klinkmann worked as Professor for Nephrology at the University of Bologna, where in February 1993 he was appointed Dean of the International Faculty for Artificial Organs. He also served from 1990 till 2002 as a permanent guest professor for Bio- engineering at Glasgow's Strathclyde University where he had been named an honorary graduate in 1988. Personal Horst Klinkmann met his future wife, Hannelore Kruse, when they were both medical students at Rostock. Her speciality is in Orthopedics. Both his wife and his son, Jens, are medically qualified. Awards and honours Klinkmann's own curriculum vitae refers to more than fifty awards and seventeen honorary memberships of medical organisations around the world, listing a few of them. Reference is also made to his membership of the editorial boards of ten national and international scientific journals. He won the National Prize of East Germany twice, in 1977 and in 1985. He also was awarded the Patriotic Order of Merit in 1987. He was appointed a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and of the Royal Belgian Academy of Medical Sciences. In 1988 he became a Fellow of the (London based) Royal College of Physicians. He became president and then an honorary member of the International Society for Artificial Organs (1979-1984) and president of the European Transplant and Dialysis Society and received honorary doctorates from universities in Marseille, Debrecen, Glasgow and Brno. On 17 June 1985 he was awarded honorary citizenship of his birth town, Teterow on the occasion of its 750th anniversary.

It was designed in 1923 urban plan on the site of the former fairground that was east of Dra≈°koviƒáa street as the new center of then new eastern part of the town that was deliberately and systematically built in the 1920s and 1930s. Four streets lead directly to the center of the square; Raƒçki street from the northwest, Vi≈°eslavova street from the southeast, Zvonimirova street from the east, and Dukljaninova street from the northeast. About Square form of the square was achieved by four representative residential and partly commercial buildings. Car and tram traffic flows anti-clockwise with tram roundabout around the rim of the square. In the center of the square is the green area with a building called Me≈°troviƒá Pavilion which has a circular layout with a colonnade around the rim and a low dome. Pavilion was built in 1938 following designs made by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. In 1941, the building was converted into a mosque. Three minarets and fountains designed by architect Stjepan Planiƒá were erected at the Pavilion's entrance. The minarets were removed in 1948, and the building was converted in 1949 to the Museum of the Croatian Revolution (in the World War II). At the beginning of the 1990s, the building was returned to the Croatian Association of Visual Artists and was restored to its original state in 2003. On the north side of the square is the business-residential building made by architect Viktor Kovaƒçiƒá in 1922, while the entire south side of the square is enclosed by large five-storey residential-commercial block built in 1933 as a residential building for- the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts built by architects Edo ≈†en and Milovan Kovaƒçeviƒá. Today, it is used as Student Dormitory of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, but it is currently closed for renovation.

The festival begins on 7 July. During the course of the tournament A, B, C and D teams of Chitral and Gilgit. battle it out on the polo field. Each team has six members with 2-4 reserve players in case of injury etc. The match duration is usually one hour. It is divided into two halves, with a 10 minutes interval. During intervals, the locals enthrall the audiences with traditional and cultural performances. The game decided in favour of the team scoring more goals. The final is held on 9 July. The field measures about 200 meters by 56 meters (normal polo field is about 270m by 150m), with 60 cm high stone walls running the length of the field on both sides instead of boards. As six players make up one side, the field can get fairly crowded. This has the advantage of slightly slowing down the pace, which, all things considered, is probably somewhat safety-enhancing. Players rarely wear helmets, The horses' legs often have no bandages, and mallets often have no grips or straps.  Historical background  The initiation of polo in Shandur is credited to The balti raja of Skardu; Ali Sher Khan Anchan who built the polo ground of Shandur as well. but the initiation of Polo in Shandur is credited to the British occupiers who made possible the building of the polo ground. It is said that in 1935, UK Administrator for Northern Areas Evelyn Hey Cobb asked Niat Qabool Hayat Kakakhel to make a well-constructed polo ground in Shandur. He constructed a polo ground with the help of the people. This polo ground was later on named as \\"Mas Junali\\". The word \\"Mass Junali\\" is derived from Khowar language. The word \\"Mas\\" means moon and \\"Junali\\" means polo ground. Cobb was impressed by Kakakhail's resourcefulness and efficiency and wished to reward him for his service, but Kakakhail refused to accept any reward for his work. Instead, for the common benefit, Kakakhail asked Cobb to bring trout to stock the local streams. Cobb ordered live trout from England and dropped them into the Ghizer River. Due to this service, the Directorate of Fisheries was established and hundreds of people were employed. Now the weight of those fishes in Hundarap Lake reach 24 kg and in Baha Lake Khukush Nallah, their weight reached 40 kg. So Mas Junali became a source of relation between the people of Chitral District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and neighbouring Gilgit-Baltistan. Many people from around the world come to watch polo match played between Chitral District and Ghizer District.

Every year, Shandur invites visitors to experience a traditional polo tournament between the teams of Chitral and Gilgit from 7 to 9 July.

The episode premiered on Comedy Central on December 9, 2015. It is the third and final part of a three-episode story arc that began with the episode \\"Sponsored Content\\" and continued in the episode \\"Truth and Advertising\\", which collectively serve as the season finale. The episode parodies the abundance of online advertising, as well as gun politics in the United States, as part of its season-long lampoon of political correctness. Plot PC Principal walks into a bar in a gentrified location in Russia. He is assaulted by patrons there but is able to kill every one of his attackers. At South Park Elementary, Kyle calls a meeting in the bathroom with Cartman, Stan, Kenny, and Butters to tell them that he believes Jimmy is dead at the hands of Principal, as per information he has been given by Leslie. He also states his belief that Stan's father, Randy has been helping Principal to kill any objectors to his political correctness views, and Stan leaves in disgust. Kyle convinces Cartman, Kenny, and Butters to all get guns to protect themselves, and they quickly do so. At dinner with his family, Randy excuses himself to the garage where Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner are examining Principal's hard drive which they seized. They discover that Principal has been fighting gentrification worldwide because he believes the source behind it is not human. They also conclude that whoever started the joke that resulted in Victoria being fired must be the mastermind behind the whole scheme. In South Park's gentrified Shi Tpa Town, Nathan and his prostitute girlfriend Classi hold Jimmy hostage at gunpoint and remove his crutches. Nathan reveals he has been using the political correctness people to work with the ads and thus gain the power he desires. At home, Cartman and his mother Liane have an argument which leads to Cartman pointing his gun at Liane, but Liane responds by pointing a gun at Cartman and she successfully gets Cartman to listen to her. Stan discovers Randy and the others in the garage and points his gun at Randy to force him to come clean, but Randy responds by pointing a gun at Stan. This leads to an argument where Sharon, Randy, Stan, and Shelly all point guns at each other but eventually have a discussion where everyone listens to one another, and Randy agrees to disclose everything he knows. Principal is captured and brought on board an aircraft carrier where a phone call is received from Barack Obama demanding that Principal be released and completely ignored, but it is revealed that Leslie is impersonating Obama. At a gun store, business is brisk, and Jimbo reveals to Officer Barbrady that there is an upcoming gun show that the entire town will attend, and Barbrady is concerned. Leslie convinces Kyle to go to the gun show and make one of his speeches about what he learned. Kyle initially declines as he has given up giving speeches, though agrees as long as Leslie is with him. At the Marsh home, the group discovers the online ad featuring Principal and Leslie, and Stan concludes that Kyle is the mastermind since he is now helping Leslie, and they drive off with their guns. Nathan shows a preview of the next day's school newspaper to Jimmy with a headline of a tragedy occurring at the gun show, but when Classi raises an objection, Nathan slaps her, as he had previously done with Mimsy, his former sidekick. Classi, however, does not tolerate this and physically assaults Nathan before giving Jimmy his crutches back, and they drive off together to find Barbrady and get to the gun show. The gun show, which resembles more of a dog breed show, is interrupted by Randy and his group with their guns drawn, and they call out for Kyle. Kyle and Leslie arrive with their gun, followed shortly by Jimmy, Barbrady, and Classi also with guns. Jimmy reveals that Leslie is an ad that has become sentient and that no one can tell who is an ad and who is human. In the audience, Mr. Mackey draws out his gun and reveals that he was the one who got Victoria fired. Everyone with guns has a conversation with one another where they realize that they all need to be more attentive to one another. Leslie vows that ads will never be defeated, but as she does, Principal arrives and physically assaults Leslie, killing her. Back in Shi Tpa Town, Randy, along with all of South Park, yells at the Whole Foods Market that they now are aware of the problems caused by ads, and the market uproots itself from the ground and flies away. Principal announces to the school that he will remain there and continue to fight for PC while also fighting to eliminate ads by keeping South Park as politically correct as possible. Critical reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10 and ended his review by stating that the episode \\"was a mixed bag in terms of tying everything together. While it did offer a satisfying mix of PC, ads and gentrification, the resolution felt like a first draft in need of some serious editing.\\" Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars and stated in his review: \\"By using headline grabbers like Trump, Jenner, ISIS and gun control sparingly throughout the season, [Matt Stone and Trey Parker] created the sharpest and most nuanced arc in the show's history\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey rated the episode an A‚àí, stating: \\"The show's creators have now moved past simply making fun of social-justice warriors in favor of examining how the SJW mentality can leave one vulnerable to corporate manipulation. That's a far more complex message than 'PC culture = stupid and bad.'\\" References External links * Episode 1910: \\"PC Principal Final Justice\\" Press Release South Park Studios.

Like the current rivalry between VMI and The Citadel, the match-up was referred to as the Military Classic of the South, due to the military heritage of both schools.

He is considered the founder of the largest national school of surgery and \\"the father of Russian urology\\".  Biography  Sergey Petrovich Fedorov was born on 23 January 1869 in Moscow in the family of a surgeon Pyotr Nikitich Fedorov. Finished cum laude his studies in one of Moscow's Classical Gimnasiums, he was admitted to the Faculty of Medicine of the Imperial Moscow University, where he was a student of Professor Alexander Bobrov (1850 ‚Äî 1904). Graduated cum laude in 1891, he practiced in Professor Bobrov's Clinic. In 1895 Sergey Fedorov was awarded with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Later he studied in Germany under Curt Schimmelbusch and Leopold Casper. In 1903 Sergey Fedorov was elected professor and head of the Subdepartment of Hospital Surgery at the Imperial Military Medical Academy in Saint Petersburg, the post he occupied till the end of his life. Professor Fedorov was the founder and president of the Russian Urological Society (1907) and president of the International Congress of Urologists in Berlin (1914). In 1909 Professor Fedorov was made the Honorary Surgeon of the Highest Court for professional achievements. In 1912 he became the Leib-Surgeon in actual duty. During World War I Professor Fedorov used to accompany the Emperor Nicholas II and the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich in their travels to the front. He participated in the provision of emergency medical care to the heir to the Russian throne, who suffered from hemophilia. By 1917 Professor Fedorov held the rank of Privy Councilor (III grade of the Table of Ranks). ¬´The court surgeon developed a trusting relationship with the Russian Emperor. On the day he abdicated from the thrown, Nicholas II consulted with S. P. Fyodorov. Originally, the Emperor wanted to abdicate in favor of his son. However, the Leib-Surgeon had to report to the Emperor about the disappointing condition of the health of Alexei Romanov, who due to a severe hereditary disease could not ascend the throne. As a result, Nicholas II decided in favor of renunciation, including on behalf of his son¬ª.M. N. Kozovenko, ¬´Moscow exile (1921‚Äì1923) in the life and activities of prominent surgeon S.P. Fyodorov¬ª. (History of Medicine, 2014, ‚Ññ2 (2) ‚Äî pg 63-64 After the October Revolution of 1917 Professor Fedorov refused to emigrate and stayed in the Soviet Russia. He was arrested a few times, but was finally released and went back to his medical practice at the Military Medical Academy. In 1921 Professor Fedorov became one of the founders and editors of Novyi khirurgicheskii arkhiv, the first Soviet surgical journal. From 1929 to 1933, simultaneously with his work at the Military Medical Academy he also served as director of the Leningrad Institute of Surgical Neuropathology (now the A. L. Polenov Russian Neurosurgical Research Institute), the first such institute in the USSR. In 1933 Professor Fedorov became the first Soviet surgeon to be awarded with the Order of Lenin. Sergey Fedorov died on 15 January 1936 in Moscow. He was buried in the Communist Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Leningrad. Contribution to surgery  ¬´Sergey Fedorov developed a combined clinical-physiological approach. His major studies dealt with the surgery of the urinary system and the bile ducts. The founder of the Russian school of urology, Professor Fedorov proposed new methods of diagnosis and developed new surgical instruments and techniques for operations on the kidneys and the urinary tract; for example, in 1899 he performed the first single-stage suprapubic prostatectomy. He also established urology as a separate medical specialty. Sergey Fedorov was also concerned with neurosurgery and abdominal surgery. He developed new techniques and modified old ones for operating on the brain, the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems, the intestines, and the bile ducts. For example, he developed the Fedorov incision for gallbladder surgery and designed a special instrumentarium for trephination of the skull, clamps to stop hemorrhage in the dura mater, a proctoscope, and a set of instruments for surgery on the bile ducts. In 1893 ‚Äî 1894 Fedorov was the first in Russia to prepare a tetanus antitoxin. He was also concerned with the surgical treatment of diseases of the esophagus and the lungs, with traumatology and military field surgery, and with oncology, anesthesiology, and blood transfusion¬ª.The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition, 1970-1979) On 7 December 1909 in the Clinic of Hospital Surgery of the Imperial Military Medical Academy Professor Fedorov used for the first time intravenous gedonal anesthesia (Hedonal) invented by Nikolai Kravkov. The success of non-inhalation anestesia impulsed the development of abdominal surgery in Russia. While working in the Clinic of Hospital Surgery for more than 30 years, Professor Fedorov \\"introduced new surgical interventions, many of which were later named after him: one of the variants of pyelotomia (Fyodorov's operation), ways of intracapsular and subcapsular nephrectomy (Fyodorov surgery), a way to repair a lowered kidney (nephropexy by Fyodorov), operations for non-removable tumors of the cardia and lower third of the esophagus in cases involving total gastric cancer (Fyodorov's surgeries), a method for removing the gallbladder (Fyodorov's method), the original method for stitching of the liver and many others. For these procedures, S.P. Fyodorov developed original surgical instruments specifically designed for new urological surgery and for surgery of the liver and biliary tract. The scientific and practical achievements of the Russian surgeon S. P. Fyodorov became widely known not only in Russia, but far beyond its borders\\".M. N.

The earthquake was also felt in neighboring Xinjiang in China, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan. The earthquake was felt with intensities of MMI IV in Islamabad, Pakistan, MMI IV in New Delhi, India, MMI IV in Kashgar, China, MMI II in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, MMI II in Kabul, Afghanistan, MMI III in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, MMI III in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and MMI II in Almaty, Kazakhstan. A truck driver and a policeman were killed while dozens more were injured and 500 homes destroyed. The epicentre of this quake was approximately distant from the epicentre of the M7.3 1911 Sarez earthquake which formed the Usoi Dam across the Murghab river. Tectonic setting The eastern part of Tajikistan (the Pamir Mountains) lies within the complex zone of collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The dominant structures in this area are a combination of thrust faults and sinistral (left lateral) strike-slip faults. The Sarez‚ÄìKarakul fault zone is a major SW‚ÄìNE trending sinistral strike-slip fault that extends from south of Sarez Lake to north of Karakul lake. The 1911 earthquake is thought to have been caused by movement on this structure. Earthquake Based on observations of ground rupture from SAR interferometry, the earthquake ruptured a 79 km section of the Sarez‚ÄìKarakul fault zone. This is consistent with the observed distribution of aftershocks and the focal mechanism. Three separate segments were involved, consisting of two longer SW‚ÄìNE trending segments linked by a shorter more WSW‚ÄìENE trending patch forming a restraining bend. The hypocenter is located within the southwesternmost segment. The earthquake's detailed rupture history has been determined using a backprojection method using teleseismic data from stations in the European seismic network. Analysis has shown that the rupture propagated to the northeast initially at speeds below the S-wave velocity (subshear), but jumping to supershear speeds. At the restraining bend it slowed to subshear speeds before accelerating again to supershear speeds on the third segment.

He claimed that this breached the Treaty's provisions on free movement of services, now Article 56 TFEU. The Conseil d'Etat asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) whether the legal profession of avocat was wholly exempt under the Art 51 TFEU official authority exception given that part of the business was concerned with exercise of official authority. the Luxembourg government argued the whole profession should be exempt given it was ‚Äòconnected organically‚Äô to the public administration of justice. AG Mayras gave an opinion that \\"official authority\\" is \\"the power of enjoying the prerogatives outside the general law, privileges of official power, and powers of coercion over citizens.\\" Judgment The European Court of Justice held that Article 49 TFEU was directly effective, even though directives had not been adopted. It laid down a precise result to be achieved. The advocate profession was not exempted from Article 49 under Article 51, because judicial exercise of power was left intact. There needed to be a single community definition and that the exemption could not be construed more broadly than would fit its purpose. If specific activities involving exercise of official authority are severable from the rest of a profession, then Article 51 cannot apply to exempt the whole lot.

Facts Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed the refusal of reimbursement for treatment for Parkinson‚Äôs disease in Kassel, which she believed was better than that available in the Netherlands by focusing on individual symptoms, was contrary to TFEU article 56. Mr Peerbooms received neurostimulation treatment in Innsbruck, which likewise would not have been covered in the Netherlands. Experts testified in both cases that it was unjustified or experimental. Dutch social insurance covered medical costs of low income people, but only if it was approved. Funding came from individual premiums, from the state, and some from other private insurance funds. Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms had paid up front in Germany and Austria. Dutch law said authorisation had required that (1) treatment had to be regarded as ‚Äònormal in the professional circles concerned‚Äô, and (2) ‚Äònecessary‚Äô so that adequate care could not be provided without undue delay by a care provider in the home state. The prior authorisation requirement was challenged as being contrary to TFEU article 56. Governments submitted that hospital services were not an economic activity if it was provided free of charge under a sickness insurance scheme. Judgment The Court of Justice held that member states could organise their social security systems, if it was compatible with EU law rules. Article 57 did not require services to be paid for by those who received it, for it to fall within article 56 - and thus a restriction required justification. However the restrictions in these cases could be justified in the interests of maintaining social security‚Äôs financial balance, or essential health reasons under TFEU article 52.

Biography  Alliata was born in Palermo from Prince Enrico Maria Alliata di Villafranca, Duke of Salaparuta (1879-1946), and a former opera singer, Oria Maria Amelia \\"Sonia\\" Ort√∫zar Ovalle de Olivares (1892-1981) , the daughter of a Chilean diplomat. After graduating from liceo artistico, Alliata studied fine arts at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Palermo, where she was a fellow student of Renato Guttuso, who portrayed her in several of his early paintings. In 1935 she married Fosco Maraini, at the time an unknown scholar, who would later become an important anthropologist, giving birth one year later to their first child, Dacia Maraini. In 1941 Maraini was invited to teach Italian literature at the Kyoto University and they moved to Japan, where they had two other children, Yuki (registered as Luisa in Italy) and Antonella \\"Toni\\". In 1943 the family was deported in a concentration camp in Nagoya following their refusal to swear allegiance to the Republic of Sal√≤. They was released at the end of the war in September 1945, and returned in Italy in 1946, settling in Bagheria, where Alliata engaged in the family business, the Salaparuta's Crow Wines. In 1955 Alliata and Maraini decided to separate. However, as divorce was illegal in Italy at the time, they were only able to divorce in 1970. Alliata subsequently moved to Rome, where she continued her work as a painter. In 1959 she sold the family wine business and founded Galleria Topazia Alliata in Trastevere, where she mainly exhibited avant-garde painters, including Carla Accardi, Eugene Charlton, Mario and Egidio de Grossi, Jannis Kounellis, Piero Manzoni, Fabio Mauri, Mohamed Melehi and Lucio Pozzi.

Born in Little Bedwyn in Wiltshire, Quelch was the younger brother of Harry Quelch. He worked for a livestock dealer from the age of eight then, when he reached fourteen, followed his father into working in an iron foundry. He moved to a rival firm for a promised increase in wages, but this was not delivered and he was instead soon laid off, rendering him unemployed for two years until he was able to regain work at his original employer. This enabled him to complete an apprenticeship; during this period, he also married Harriet Rosier, and became prominent in the local temperance movement.John S. Partington, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIII, pp.319-334 Quelch's brother Harry had moved to London and joined the Democratic Federation. Lorenzo was influenced by this and distributed literature from the group, but was also associated with the local Liberal Party. They gave him funds to start a working men's club in Hungerford, and Lorenzo used this to promote the ideas of the Democratic Federation in the town. In 1891, he was elected as the Berkshire secretary for the English Land Restoration League, then as regional organiser the following year. In order to further this, Quelch moved to Reading in 1893, and also joined the renamed Social Democratic Federation (SDF). He proved an effective organiser, in particular rallying unemployed workers and encouraging town councils to provide paid labour for them. Through it, he became active in the Agricultural and General Workers' Union, and attended the Trades Union Congress in 1895 on its behalf. Quelch stood for the Reading Board of Guardians on three occasions from 1894 to 1897; he was not elected, although several other SDF candidates were. In 1896, the AGWU collapsed, leaving Quelch unemployed, although he was able to find work for the SDF itself, initially in Reading, then by co-option to the SDF executive as a national propagandist. He campaigned for his brother in the 1898 Reading by-election, then afterwards spent time in Gibraltar, organising the Coal Porters' Union. He spent six successful months there before moving to London, alternating work in foundries and for the SDF. The SDF became the core of a new British Socialist Party (BSP), and Quelch was its delegate to the Reading Trades and Labour Council, becoming the council's secretary in 1917. The BSP affiliated to the Labour Party, and with its support, Quelch was elected to Reading Town Council for the Minster ward in 1914. He also became president of the town's new Trade Union Club. Quelch organised a vote of local BSP members to gauge their views on British involvement in World War I; they were in favour, and so Quelch gave pro-war speeches, and joined the National Socialist Party (NSP) split from the BSP. He hoped to be the Labour candidate for Reading at the 1918 general election, but instead an anti-war Independent Labour Party member was chosen, and Quelch stood against him as an independent NSP candidate. He took only 5.2% of the vote and came bottom of the poll. Following the declaration of the result, he conceded that standing against Labour was a mistake, and he thereafter devoted his time to the party. Quelch remained on the town council, and was also elected to the Board of Guardians in 1919, focusing his time on finding solutions to problems of unemployment and promoting house building in the town. He became an alderman in 1933, serving until his death four years later.

Facts Alpine Investments BV claimed that the Dutch Ministry of Finance should not have prohibited it on 1 October 1991 from ‚Äòcold calling‚Äô to sell commodities futures without prior consent from customers, because this was an unjustifiable restriction on freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 (ex article 49 TEEC). Alpine, which place orders with Merrill Lynch, offered portfolio management, investment advice and the transmission of clients‚Äô orders to brokers operating on commodities futures markets. The Wet Effectenhandel (Law on Securities Transactions) of 30 October 1985, article 6(1) required a licence to be an intermediary and art 8(2) said it could be restricted to prevent ‚Äòundesirable developments in securities trading.‚Äô The Ministry got numerous complaints, including people from other member states, and he acted to preserve the Dutch financial sector‚Äôs reputation. On January 1992 it got authorisation to place orders with another broker, Rodham & Renshaw, but still with a prohibition on cold calling. The Dutch Administrative Court referred to the ECJ asking whether protection of consumers and protecting the Dutch securities trading reputation could be a public interest reason to stop cold calling, and whether a ban was necessary. It was common ground that this was services under art 60 TEEC as it was for remuneration. Judgment The Court of Justice held that Alpine Investments BV could be restrained from \\"cold calling\\" because the rules were likely justified on grounds of consumer protection and preserving the Dutch financial sector's good reputation.

It was first published in 1940 in the children's stories collection Morozko released by Sverdlovsk Publishing House.Bazhov 1952, p. 246. It was later included in The Malachite Casket collection. In this fairy tale, the characters meet the female creature from the Ural folklore called Poskakushka (lit. \\"the jumping/hopping girl\\"), who can do the magical dance that reveals gold deposits. This is one of the most popular stories of the collection.Balina 2013, p. 265. It was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams in 1944, and by Eve Manning in the 1950s. Pavel Bazhov indicated that all his stories can be divided into two groups based on tone: \\"child-toned\\" (e.g. \\"Silver Hoof\\") and \\"adult-toned\\" (e.g. \\"The Stone Flower\\"). He called \\"The Fire-Fairy\\" a \\"child-toned\\" story. Such stories have simple plots, children are the main characters, and the mythical creatures help them, typically leading the story to a happy ending.Litovskaya 2014, p. 247.  Publication  In 1939 Klavdiya Rozhdestvenskaya, the editor- in-chief of Sverdlovsk Publishing House was working on the children's book Morozko. She decided to include Bazhov's fairy tale \\"Silver Hoof\\" in it, which had previously been published in Uralsky Sovremennik, and said to Bazhov that she needed another story or two. Bazhov replied that he had an idea about the character Poskakushka, but he needed to go back to the factory and \\"relive old memories\\" by talking to some story-tellers. After a short trip to Polevskoy Bazhov completed \\"The Fire-Fairy\\". The fairy tale was published in Morozko and became a popular children's story. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson as a part of The Malachite Casket: Tales from the Urals collection. The title was translated as \\"The Fire-Fairy\\".Bazhov 1944, p. 122. In the 1950s another translation of The Malachite Casket was made by Eve Manning The story was published as \\"The Dancing Fire Maid\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 9. It was included in James Riordan's collection of stories The Mistress of the Copper Mountain: Tales from the Urals, published in 1974 by Frederick Muller Ltd. Riordan heard the tales from a headteacher when he was bedridden in Sverdlovsk. After returning to England he rewrote the tales from memory, checking them against Bazhov's book. He preferred not to call himself \\"translator\\", he believed that \\"communicator\\" was more appropriate.  Sources  Bazhov's stories are based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors. In their stories, Poskakushka is a dancing girl who shows the location of gold. The help of such mythical creature would explain why some miners were luckier than others, and unexplained natural phenomena such as the location of gold. She is sometimes called the daughter of Poloz the Great Snake from \\"The Great Snake\\".Bazhov 1952, p. 245. The folklorists believed that the character is connected with the river Poskakukha next to the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant in the old Sysert Mining District. The name of the river Poskakukha and its affectionate diminutive form Poskakushka literally mean \\"the jumping (hopping) girl\\". The gold prospectors say that the gold placement is unusual there: \\"there is gold in some places, but there is nothing right next to it\\".Blazhes 1983, p. 10. The pits are placed so that they look like miners decided to \\"jump over\\" some spots, and that is how the \\"hopping girl\\" appeared. There was also the Poskakushkinsky mine. To reach it, one \\"should jump over the marshes\\".Shvabauer 2009, p. 119. Nataliya Shvabauer believed that this character did not no exist in the original Ural folk tradition, although the author constructed it according to the \\"mythological canon\\". This canon is believed to be pagan. The Fire-Fairy (alternative translation: the Dancing Fire MaidBazhov 1950s, p. 178.) and its magical dance that reveals gold deposits could be based on the Mansi goddess Sorni-Nai (she was called the Golden Woman in Russian). Her name can be literally translated from Vogul as \\"Gold-Fire\\". Alexei Ivanov commented that the Dancing Fire Maid's pagan origin \\"cannot be denied\\", as evident from her connection between gold and fire and her dancing in a circle, as in pagan khorovods. For other Finno-Ugric peoples gold was associated with fire, too. The 1968 docufiction feature film Tales of the Ural Mountains () claimed that Bazhov had heard about the Poskakushkinsky mine, and created the character from scratch. For him \\"hopping\\" had sounded magical and had been associated with fire, and that is how the Fire-Fairy appeared. However, according to the data collected in folklorist expeditions, Poskakushka did exist in local folklore.  Plot A group of gold prospectors, including an old man Yefim (alternative translation: Grandpa EfimBazhov 1944, p. 123.) and an 8-year-old boy Fedyunka, called \\"Tyunka\\" by his father, sit around a fire in the woods. A tiny girl suddenly jumps out of the fire. > ... just like a doll, she was, but alive. Her hair was red, her sarafan > blue, and she held a blue kerchief in her hand. She looked around them > merrily and her teeth shone white. Then she put one hand on her hip, raised > the blue kerchief with the other and began to dance.Bazhov 1950s, p. 179. She finishes her dance and disappears, while the prospectors look as if spellbound and almost forget the experience afterwards. The only person who clearly remember the maid is Fedyunka. He also hears the cry of an eagle-owl as if the bird is laughing at him. Yefim explains that the girl was the Fire- Fairy, a sign of gold: \\"If the dancer shows herself, there's gold in that place\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 180. Next morning the prospectors start digging in the area, but cannot seem to remember the exact place where the maid had danced. Fedyunka blames the owl, but no one believes him. Children at the factory give him a nickname \\"Dancing Tyunka\\" (). The only person who doesn't laugh at him is Yefim. They become close friends. One day they see the Fire-Fairy again, and again the eagle-owl scares her away. Fedyunka is convinced that the Fairy would have shown them the way to gold if the owl had not hooted. In the winter Fedyunka's father leaves to work in the mine, and the boy stays with his evil step-mother. He decides to live with Yefim instead. On his way to the village he sees the Fire-Fairy again. He follows her and gets lost in the forest, but the maid dances around him, and the snow melts. The winter turns into summer, flowers bloom, birds start singing on a birch tree. The Fairy laughs at Fedyunka and gives him an old spade that leads him out of the forest. Next day Fedyunka and Yefim go back to the birch tree and find a lot of gold. They cannot keep the secret for long, and eventually the landlord takes hold of the place, but Fedyunka and Yefim live in wealth for many years.  Analysis  Denis Zherdev noted that Bazhov liked the idea of a child together with an old man contacting the mythical creatures. These people are traditionally portrayed as the closest to the otherworldly, but at the same time they are the least reliable narrators in the adult world. Yelena Prikazchikova commented that the Fairy's gift of the magic spade can be regarded as spiritual. The spade only does magic because it is used by skilled human hands. The magic power is contains is nothing but Fedyunka's real skill.Bazhov 1952, p. 234. He is a metaphor for a young gold prospector moved by his insatiable thirst of knowledge, which had been recently awakened in him by old experienced miners.

Shane is director of the Autism Language Program and Communication Enhancement Program at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, former director of the Institute on Applied Technology, and associate professor at Harvard Medical School. He is internationally known for his research and development of augmented and alternative communication systems to support the communication needs of people with neuromuscular disorders, autism and other disabilities. Education Shane graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1969 with a B.A. in sociology. He went on to earn an M.A. in speech pathology and audiology in 1972 (also from the University of Massachusetts) and a PhD in speech pathology in 1975 from Syracuse University. He completed a doctoral fellowship in 1975 at the Mayo Clinic. Career Howard Shane ‚Äì 2014 Shane began his career as an assistant professor of communication sciences at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont (1975‚Äì1977). He served as associate professor at Emerson College, Department of Communication Studies, (1977‚Äì1995), and visiting associate professor for the University of Massachusetts (1985‚Äì1990). Shane was an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School's Department of Otology and Laryngology (1986‚Äì1995) before becoming an associate professor (1996‚Äìpresent). Shane is also a professor of communication science and disorders at MGH Institute of Health Professions (1997‚Äìpresent). In 1977, Shane was appointed associate scientist of otolaryngology at Boston Children's Hospital. Also in 1977, Shane was appointed the director of speech pathology and audiology at the Developmental Evaluation Clinic at Children's Hospital Boston. and held that position until 1991. In 1985, he was appointed director of the Communication Enhancement Center (CED), the augmentative communication program, at Boston Children's Hospital. In 2005, he assumed leadership of the Center for Communication Enhancement (which encompassed the old CEC and five other programs), a role he continues to hold . For his lifetime achievements at Boston Children's Hospital, Shane was awarded the Center for Communication Enhancement's inaugural Directorship Chair in 2015. The endowed Chair, which will be named for him in future, is funded by the Boston Children's Hospital Otolaryngologic Foundation. Communication and technology Shane has spent much of his career researching and developing assistive technologies that support children and adults, including Stephen Hawking, whose ability to communicate in spoken or written language forms is \\"limited by autism, cerebral palsy, language disorders, spinal cord injuries, or neuromuscular diseases.\\" The systems have become so refined that a person does not need dexterity to activate a computer on their own and select letters, words or pre-programmed phrases from a screen. Small muscle movements suffice. Finger twitches, head nods and eye blinks, as well as the spoken voice for those with that ability, are all that is required for individuals to communicate independently. Touch 'N Speak In 1983, Shane directed a program through his Institute on Technology to create technology solutions for students at Boston College. Other team members included Allen Field from Boston Children's Hospital , Katharyn Dawson, a speech and language pathologist, and Don Ricciato, principal of the school. The team was dedicated to designing and implementing teaching tools to assist people who were unable to speak in their efforts to communicate. The school worked with students whose ages ranged from 10 to 25 and who exhibited a wide range of neurological, physical and intellectual challenges. This collaboration led to the creation of Touch 'N Speak, a software program that allowed students to use movement (i.e., of an elbow or head), to activate touch-sensitivity keyboards to access pre-programmed messages and activate a vocal mechanism. This also marked the first time that a computer (an Apple IIe) was successfully mounted on a wheelchair. Ground-breaking at the time, this was one of the first innovations in the field of \\"augmentative communication,\\" recognized as a valid form of communication by the American Speech‚ÄìLanguage‚ÄìHearing Association in 1981. Microsystems Software In 1989, Shane consulted with the programmers of Microsystems Software Inc., a company owned by Richard and Deborah Gorgens to develop software packages to assist people with disabilities in their efforts to participate in the workplace. The result was HandiWare, a collection of computer programs that ran on IBM-compatible PCs and sought to assist people with \\"physical impairments, visual impairments and those individuals requiring computer-aided speech.\\" HandiChat, targeted for people with speech impairments, allowed individuals to type on a keyboard and have their words spoken through a DECtalk speech synthesizer. HandiWord, a \\"word prediction program\\", was responsive to individuals' most frequently used words and finished spelling out words based on the first few letters. At the time these programs were being introduced, the Americans with Disabilities Act was newly enacted. Communication technologies like HandiWare enabled individuals who had not worked in 10‚Äì15 years because of their communication difficulties return to and become productive members of the work place. Starbright World In 1995, a computer-generated play world called Starbright World was made available to the children's hospital, as well as other hospitals in New York, Pittsburgh and California, that allowed patients to connect through cyberspace. Starbright World, an interactive network financed by Steven Spielberg, was intended to help patients with serious and chronic illnesses escape in the world of play and, if desired, connect with others facing the same kind of diagnosis and treatment. Initially, access to Starbright World relied on a child's ability to use a mouse or type on a keyboard. Shane and his team worked to find alternate navigation techniques for children whose motor skills were impaired or for those who did not yet have the required computer skills. Monarch School In 2002, the Monarch School for Autism, in Shaker Heights, Ohio, began a collaboration with Boston Children's Hospital, and MGH Institute of Health Professionals to support children with autism in their use of communication and development of life skills. The Monarch School for Autism, an intensive one-one-one, language-enrichment program, was the first of its kind in Ohio, serving only children with autism whose needs are often under-served in the public school system. At the time, Shane had more than 30 years experience assisting people with autism and, as a result, had developed computer software specifically designed to \\"boost verbal communication skills\\" using visual information. The focus of the collaboration, headed by Shane, was to develop a curriculum using the software and other complimentary technologies reliant on visual cuing that could serve as a model for educational programs throughout the U.S. Visual Immersion System Shane led a team to develop the Visual Immersion System (VIS), a visual curriculum to support the communication needs of people with disabilities. The curriculum makes use of communication technology, including the iPad, which allows people with autism to engage in visual activities that aid in the development of language skills. The effectiveness of the program is currently under study, with clinical evidence \\"still emerging,\\" but, as Shane states, \\"the excitement and interest in these technologies exist because they are working.\\" Facilitated Communication Facilitated Communication (FC), popularized in the early 1990s in the United States by Douglas Biklen, is an alleged communication technique in which the facilitator (usually a parent, educator, or caregiver) holds the hand, shoulder or arm of a person with disabilities in order to type on a paper letter board or mechanical keyboard. Shane first learned of FC in Sweden, when he attended an International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) conference where Rosemary Crossley gave a speech.. He questioned claims from promoters that individuals with severe disabilities, some as young as 5 or 6 years old, without formal training in reading or written language could produce messages that included \\"perfectly spelled sentences\\" and whether or not the communications were originating from the children or the adult facilitators. On the 1993 Frontline show, Prisoners of Silence, produced by Jon Palfreman, Shane questioned the sophistication of the sentences being typed using FC. Students, with the help of facilitators, were typing out grammatically correct and accurately spelled sentences that, according to Shane, held \\"insights that go far beyond their years.\\" Proponents maintained that these children learned language and written language skills by being \\"immersed in language-rich environments.\\" Already versed in communications technology that allowed people with autism and a wide range of physical disabilities to communicate independently and without someone else's touch, Shane criticized FC as \\"bogus nonsense\\" and \\"a complete waste of time.\\" Shane became involved with FC further when he was called as an expert witness in a court case. The parents were accused of sexual abuse through facilitator Janyce Boynton who using FC with their autistic child. Shane established simple double-blind protocols to test the validity of the message and determine authorship of the messages. The results indicated that not only was the child incapable of typing out the messages, the content produced was based on facilitator's knowledge of the materials presented. In his book, Facilitated Communication: The Clinical and Social Phenomenon, Shane outlines a \\"wide range of tasks and procedures,\\" that practitioners can use to establish the source of the facilitated messages. Since that first court case, Shane has continued to serve as an expert witness with the results, to date, always the same. Rather than support people with autism in their efforts to communication, FC, according to Shane is \\"hurtful and harmful\\" and deprives \\"children of their right to independently communicate.\\" Facilitator Boynton, realizing she had been the one doing the communication pressured her school administration to err on the side of caution and end the practice of FC. Over the years Shane kept in touch with Boynton and continued to encourage her to speak out about FC. Shane believes that FC messages originate from facilitators who \\"subconsciously guide the hands and fingers of people they are assigned to help.\\" via the ideomotor phenomenon. With regard to the ideomotor phenomenon and FC, the facilitators become so absorbed in the typing process, they are unaware of their own movements while holding onto their disabled communication partner. Shane stated on Prisoners of Silence: > You can't be a one-finger typist and not look at the keyboard. You just > can't get oriented. You don't have a home position. And when you watch > children who are F/C ‚Äì facilitated communication ‚Äì users, they may not be > looking at the language board, but the facilitators are not taking their > eyes off it. They're fixed on it. Critics of Shane's stance on FC claim that testing is unfair to the person with disabilities who, they claim, might exhibit test anxiety or \\"freeze in their ability to respond.\\" Donald P. Oswald, who reviewed The Facilitated Communication: Clinical and Social Phemenon, praised the book for its \\"valuable perspectives on the FC story,\\" citing chapters written by Jon Palfreman, Gina Green, Wolf Wolfensberger, Barry Prizant, and Shane that provide a \\"preliminary retrospective of the FC fad in the United States,\\" but criticized the book for its sometimes \\"dispassionate discourse.\\" He wrote: > The authors in this work occasionally reveal the personal distress they have > experienced and as a result, at times the tone of their writing is defensive > or aggressive. Nonetheless, this book offers valuable perspectives on the FC > story and, depending on the reader's personal position, will stimulate, > enlighten and, at times, enrage. Supporters of FC state that often people start out using a facilitator and eventually learn to type without physical support. Shane responded by saying '\\"If someone‚Äôs going to be a typist, they don‚Äôt need somebody to facilitate them.\\"' Memberships and appointments *SpecialNeedsWare Advisory Board (Chair, 2012) * Director, Model Autism Program (MAP), Boston Public Schools (2006) * Director, Clinical and Research Liaison, Monarch School for Autism (2002) Conferences and summits *Panelist with Matthew Goodwin, director of clinical research at MIT Media Lab and co-director of the Autism Technology Initiative at MIT, at the Third Annual Summit on Autism, hosted by Kids Institute for Development and Advancement (KiDA), University of California.

He was a pioneer in his field leading to the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs place as a world leader in the science of animal genetics. He was the first Director of the Institute of Animal Breeding and the first Professor of Animal Genetics. He is said to have laid the foundations of medical genetics. Life He was born in Tipton in England on 2 March 1886 the only surviving son of Thomas Crew, a grocer.Proceedings of the Royal Society of London: Obituary by Lancelot Hogben He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham and the High School in Birmingham. From an early age he took an interest in breeding bantam chickens, and won prizes at local shows. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, studying under Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire and Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer, and graduating MB ChB in 1912. In the First World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, rising to the rank of Major. He was on active service with the 3rd Field Ambulance Service in France. Professor Alan William Greenwood ran the Institute during Crew‚Äôs wartime absence. In 1920 Sharpey-Schafer approached him, asking him to run the newly created animal breeding research station in Edinburgh. This was originally housed at High School Yards, transferring to King's Buildings in 1924, there linking to the Chemistry Department. His staff at the Institute was illustrious: including John Burdon Sanderson Haldane, Lancelot Hogben, Julian Huxley, Bertold Paul Wiesner and (as a postgraduate) Honor Fell. At this time the UK‚Äôs first Pregnancy Diagnosis Laboratory was also set up under Crew as a tangential area of public benefit, linked to their research. In the 1930s its staff was increased by scientists from Germany and Italy including Hermann Joseph Muller, Charlotte Auerbach and Guido Pontecorvo. In 1921 he received a doctorate (DSc) on his work on sex- determination in frogs. He received an MD the same year and a PhD in 1923 on the achondroplasia-like condition met with in cattle, specifically the Dexter cattle breed. In 1928 he was created the first Professor of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh, a chair indirectly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1922. His proposers were James Cossar Ewart, Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer, James Hartley Ashworth and Sir Robert Blyth Greig. He served as the Society‚Äôs Secretary from 1931 to 1936 and as Vice-President from 1936 to 1939. He won the Society's Keith Medal for the period 1937-39. In 1939 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1929 Frederick Hutt travelled from Canada and sought Crew out to specifically study genetics under him, and later was to fill his role in the world of animal genetics. During the Second World War he established the Polish School of Medicine in Edinburgh, which survived until 1949 and had a total of 228 graduates. In 1940, he was commanding officer of the Military Hospital at Edinburgh Castle, and a member of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He saw that the Polish forces included medical professors, lecturers and students and conceived the idea of these students being taught by their own teachers in Polish. He proposed establishing a Polish Medical Faculty in the University of Edinburgh, supported by the dean of the medical faculty, Professor Sydney Smith. The move was approved by the University Senate with the backing of the Principal, Sir Thomas Holland. The University signed an agreement with the Polish Government in Exile in London, headed by General Wladyslaw Sikorski, on 24 February 1941, to create the Polish School of Medicine. Crew was one of eight Scottish professors in the school, working alongside ten Polish professors. On 28 May 1943, the President of the Polish Republic, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Raczkiewicz, created Crew a Commander of the Order \\"Polonia Restituta\\" alongside Professor Sydney Smith and Sir Thomas Holland, at a ceremony in the University's McEwan Hall. On 4 June 1946, Crew attended a special graduation ceremony at the University of Edinburgh marking the 25th anniversary of the Polish School of Medicine's foundation. Professor John Crofton, dean of the medical faculty, said in the opening address: \\"[...] to bring about the Polish School of Medicine [...] required a substantial pinch of imagination as a catalyst. This un-British ingredient was provided by Professor Frank Crew [...], but of course in respect of imagination Professor Crew is at least a couple of standard deviations from the British mean.\\" During the war he was also Director of Medical Research for the War Office, with the rank of Brigadier. In 1944 he succeeded Professor Percy Samuel Lelean in the Bruce and John Usher Chair in Public Health at the University of Edinburgh.British Medical Journal 1 April 1944 In 1955 he moved to Ain Shams University in Cairo as Professor of Social and Preventative Medicine. In 1957-8 he worked for the World Health Organization as a visiting Professor at the University of Rangoon.The Lancet: 9 June 1973: obituaries In 1958 the University of Edinburgh awarded him a Doctor of Letters (LLD). He died on 26 May 1973.

A contact can be formed during deposition, by the intrusion of magma, or through faulting or other deformation of rock beds that brings distinct rock bodies into contact. The geologic subdiscipline of stratigraphy is primarily concerned with depositional contacts,Boggs 2006, p. 401 while faults and shear zones are of particular interest in structural geology. Faults and shear zones can be regarded as a form of secondary structure in the rock beds.Davis and Kluth 2011, p.21  Types of contacts   Depositional   Conformable  Sharp, conformable sandstone bedding contact, near Terrace Bay, Ontario, Canada. Conformable contacts represent no time gap in the geologic record. They are usually planar, though they may have slightly irregular topography. These contacts represent continual, uninterrupted deposition and accumulation of sedimentary rocks, or represent lava flows. A conformable contact can be abrupt, where the contact separates beds of distinct lithology. Abrupt contacts coincide with bedding planes and represent a change in depositional environment, but with only a minor hiatus in deposition with no significant erosion. A brief hiatus without erosion is known as a diastem. Gradational contacts occur where the change in depositional environment takes place over a longer period of time. They are further divided into progressive gradual contacts where the change in lithology is more or less continuous, or intercalated contacts where thin beds of a new lithology appear at the base of the contact zone, become thicker upwards, and completely replaced the old lithology at the top of the contact zone.  Non-conformable  Unconformities are gaps in the geologic record within a stratigraphic unit. These gaps can be caused by periods of non-deposition or by erosion. As a result, two adjacent rock units may have significantly different ages.  Intrusive  Intrusive dike with chilled margins, near Terrace Bay, Ontario, Canada. Intrusive contacts are the surfaces between host (or country) rock and an intrusive magmatic body. The older country rock is crosscut by a younger magmatic body. The nature of the intruding body depends its composition and depth. Common examples are igneous dikes, sills, plutons, and batholiths. Depending on the composition of the magma, the intrusive body may have a complex internal structure which can provide insight into its emplacement. The country rock responds to the immense heat from the intruding body numerous ways. Chill margins are created if the magma is cooled too quickly to fully crystallise. The result is a distinct boundary of very fine grain igneous rock along the border of the country rock. The surrounding rock may be \\"baked\\" through contact metamorphism, resulting in non-foliated metamorphic rocks. Rocks that were originally limestone, quartz sandstone, and shale become marble, quartzite, and hornfels, respectively.  Fault  Fault and shear zone contacts can be represented by either discrete breaks and discontinuities, or ductile deformation without a physical break in stratigraphy. Fault surface contacts show discrete breaks and have an attitude and position which describes the contact between two formations. These fault surfaces can be polished into slickensided surfaces which depict striations in the direction of the fault movement. Shear zones are different as there is no physical break displayed, but there is displacement.  Significance and application  Cross-cutting relationships between contacts and formations can be used to determine the geological history of an area. Events are in order, from oldest to youngest, A to F. Identifying and understanding the relationship between contacts is important in determining relative ages of rocks and formations. Contacts are a key feature used to create geological maps. Cross-cutting relationships of these contacts can be used to determine the relative geological history of an area or of an outcrop.  Important geological contacts  The golden spikes on geologic timescales represent internationally agreed upon references for the boundaries of the stages in the geologic timescale. These contacts have been identified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and they are known as GSSPs, or global boundary stratotype section and points. Some of these boundary points are at physical locations, while others are in ice drill core sections, or have been defined chronometrically. The GSSP for the Danian Stage marks the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Paleocene Series. Located in Tunisia, the contact is described as a reddish layer at the base of a dark clay layer. This reddish layer is the Iridium Anomaly, representative of the fallout of the major impact that resulted in the mass extinction event that ended the Cretaceous.

The school complex is in a roughly rectangular area bounded on the south by Poston Road, and on the other sides by the remains of irrigation ditches that were also the product of camp labor. The school consists of a series of single-story buildings, built out of adobe blocks and covered with flat roofs. Most of them served as general-purpose classrooms; other surviving buildings include a woodcraft shop, library, and portions of the auditorium, which was significantly damaged by fire in 2001. Adobe blocks in drying racks at Poston War Relocation Center The Poston Camp was established after the United States entered into World War II, in response to widespread (and largely unfounded racist) fears that Americans of Japanese descent posed a risk to the war effort, particularly in the western United States. Most of the Poston camp infrastructure was erected in great haste by contractors in early 1942, and evacuees began arriving in May of that year. Construction of the school was organized by the camp administration, largely in response to concerns raised by the evacuees over the lack of such educational facilities. The school buildings were designed by Yoshisaku Hirose, a naturalized Japanese immigrant, and an evacuee, and they were built largely out of locally-available materials by camp residents. The building walls are fashioned out of adobe blocks in size, and finished on the outside with a layer of adobe plaster. Poston was the only one of the ten internment camps at which schools of this type were built in this way, and this is the only internment camp school complex to survive today. Most of the other internment camp buildings at Poston (and indeed at many other camps) have long since been demolished.

Tube flies differ from traditional artificial flies as they are tied on small diameter tubes, not hooks. Tube flies were originated in Aberdeen, Scotland by fly-dresser Minnie Morawski for Atlantic salmon anglers around 1945. Tube flies were designed to improve hooking success and to prevent damage to complex and expensive salmon flies by the teeth of hooked salmon. Tube flies have been widely adapted to fly patterns for a variety of cold water and warm water species and are extremely popular for steelhead and salmon in the Pacific Northwest and northeast United States, as well as saltwater species along the Atlantic, Florida and Gulf Coasts. They are widely used in European waters for Atlantic salmon, sea trout and pike. History Credit for the invention of the tube fly tying style belongs to fly dresser Minnie Morawski of the Charles Playfair and Company, Aberdeen, Scotland. In 1945 she began experimenting with hollowed out sections of turkey quills as a base for traditional salmon and trout flies rather than traditional hooks. Initial patterns were tied on top of the turkey quill tubes but the tying style quickly evolved into tying patterns \\"in the round\\" and on plastic tubes. By the late 1950s, the advantages of the tube fly style were being hailed by Trout and Salmon magazine as the most important innovation in salmon fishing since the introduction of \\"greased line fishing\\" techniques in the 1930s. The tube fly style was quickly adopted in the Pacific Northwest, Northeast U.S. and Florida for salmon, striped bass and tarpon respectively in saltwater environments. For the most part, the tube fly style was being adapted in the U.S. to fly patterns that were trolled rather than cast while fishing. Throughout the late 1940s through early 1970s a variety of small entrepreneurial fly tiers sold commercially tied tube flies along the Pacific, Atlantic and Florida coasts to anglers. As anglers in both Europe and the U.S. gained exposure to the advantages of tube flies, more patterns emerged and more species of game fish were targeted with tube style flies. The use of tube flies for casting to salmon and steelhead in the Puget Sound region was first documented in Fly Fishing for Pacific Salmon (Ferguson, Johnson, Trotter, 1985). Sometime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, American anglers began introducing the tube fly style to surface poppers, sliders and other floating patterns for both saltwater and freshwater species. In 1987 Bob Popovic, a noted New Jersey based fly designer and angler introduced the use of high density foam material for saltwater poppers tied tube style. Although traditional hook based flies remain the dominant style used by fly anglers, tube fly style patterns and materials have been adopted for globally for most species and waters targeted by fly anglers. Typical configuration and advantages A rigged tube fly showing junction tube and hook Tube flies are threaded on a tippet instead of the traditional method of tying the fly to the tippet. The angler threads a tippet through the tube and attaches the tippet to a hook. Hooks used for tube flies are typically short shank, wide gap hooks. Once tied to the tippet, the hook is pulled into a junction tube attached to the rear of the tube fly. When a fish is hooked, the fly is typically dislodged from the hook and slides up the tippet. This protects the fly from damage by the fishes teeth. The use of wide gap, short shank hooks with tube flies provides less leverage for fish and results in higher hookup rates over traditional style flies. An additional advantage results from the ability to replace dulled or damaged hooks without replacing the fly. Tube fly hooks can be oriented with hook point down or up depending on conditions. Construction Tube fly vise adapter with tube in place Tube flies are tied on short sections of brass, copper, aluminum or plastic tubing instead of hooks. Metal tubes are used to add weight to the fly and are usually lined with smaller diameter plastic tubes to protect the tippet. All manner of commercially available tubes and tube fly components are available to the fly tier, many of a specialty nature. Tube fly patterns are tied in the same manner and with the same type of materials used to tie traditional artificial flies. However instead of a hook being clamped in a vise, tube flies are tied using purpose built tube fly vises or adapters. The small diameter tubing is threaded on a tapered needle until secure allowing the addition of materials without the tube slipping or spinning. The ends of plastic tubes are flared with a heat source either before or after the addition of materials to prevent thread from coming off the end of the tube. Plastic or metal cones are sometimes added at the head of the fly to add weight and or create sonic disturbances in the water. Typical patterns Tube flies are most popular for salmon, steelhead and large saltwater patterns. However just about any large to medium fly pattern can be tied and fished as a tube fly.

It arises naturally in design of experiments. There is a group of subjects. Each subject has several features, which are considered binary. For example: each subject can be either young or old; either black or white; either tall or short; etc. The goal is to divide the subjects to two sub-groups: treatment group (T) and control group (C), such that for each feature, the number of subjects that have this feature in T is roughly equal to the number of subjects that have this feature in C. E.g., both groups should have roughly the same number of young people, the same number of black people, the same number of tall people, etc.  Matrix representation  Formally, the set balancing problem can be described as follows. m is the number of subjects in the general population. n is the number of potential features. The subjects are described by A, an n\\\\times m matrix with entries in {0,1}. Each column represents a subject and each row represents a feature. a_{i,j}=1 if subject j has feature i, and a_{i,j}=0 if subject j does not have feature i. The partition to groups is described by b, an m\\\\times 1 vector with entries in {-1,1}. b_j=1 if subject j is in the treatment group T and b_j=-1 is subject j is in the control group C. The balance of features is described by c = A\\\\cdot b. This is an n\\\\times 1 vector. The numeric value of c_i is the imbalance in feature i: if c_i>0 then there are more subjects with i in T and if c_i<0 then there are more subjects with i in C. The imbalance of a given partition is defined as: ::I(b) = ||A\\\\cdot b||_\\\\infty = \\\\max_{i\\\\in 1\\\\dots,n}|c_iThe set balancing problem is to find a vector b which minimizes the imbalance I(b).  Randomized algorithm  An approximate solution can be found with the following very simple randomized algorithm: ::Send each subject to the treatment group with probability 1/2. In matrix formulation: ::Choose the elements of b randomly with probability 1/2 to each value in {1,-1}. Surprisingly, although this algorithm completely ignores the matrix A, it achieves a small imbalance with high probability when there are many features. Formally, for a random vector b: ::Prob\\\\left[ I(b) \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\frac{2}{n} PROOF: Let k_i be the total number of subjects that have feature i (equivalently, the number of ones in the i-th of the matrix A). Consider the following two cases: Easy case: k_i \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}. Then, with probability 1, the imbalance in feature i (that we marked by c_i) is at most \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}. Hard case: k_i > \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}. For every j, let X_j = a_{i,j}b_j. Each such X_j is a random variable that can be either 1 or -1 with probability 1/2. The imbalance in feature i is: c_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^m{X_j}. Since the X_j are independent random variables, by the Chernoff bound, for every a>0: ::Prob\\\\left[|c_i|\\\\geq a\\\\right] \\\\leq 2 \\\\exp(-a^2/2m) Select: a=\\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n} and get: ::Prob\\\\left[|c_i|\\\\geq \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\frac{2}{n^2} By the union bound, ::Prob\\\\left[\\\\exists i: |c_i|\\\\geq \\\\sqrt{4m\\\\ln n}\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\frac{2}{n}.

In 2015, Wetteren folded and merged with another club, liberating the matricule which was sold to people wanting to revive the former RWDM with matricule 47 which folded in 2002. As such the new club was named RWDM47. The club has been on the rise ever since winning two consecutive promotions from the fifth tier to the fourth and fourth to third. The club holds a strong fanbase with an average of 3 to 4 thousand supporters at home and bring large numbers away. The owner, Thierry Dailly has become a favourite at the club on how he has run things and has prepared the club for life in the second tier, the division they last played in when they played as RWDM Brussels in 2014. RWDM's academy has always been one of the best in Belgium and many footballers have come from there, notably Adnan Januzaj and Michy Batshuayi to name a few Belgian internationals as well as a few internationals for other countries. The club currently plays in the Belgian First Division B. It participated in the 2015‚Äì16 Belgian Cup, where it reached the fourth round.  Rivalries and fanbase  RWDM's traditional rival is Union Saint-Gilloise, which goes back to the 19th century when RWDM were known as Daring Club. RWDM also have a rivalry with RSC Anderlecht, with just 3 kilometres separating the two clubs and the fixtures often taking over the mantle of the \\"Derby of Brussels\\" in the professional era due to Union's relative decline. RWDM also have rivalries with Eendracht Aalst, Lierse and RFC Li√®ge. RWDM drew support from across the Belgian capital due to its merger of 4 teams, as well as in the Periphery, where many Brusseleirs migrated to, in contrast to the more locally based Saint-Gilles support and the nationwide Anderlecht support. It had high attendances for a big part of its existence as RWDM, until financial troubles and the subsequent changeover with Johan Vermeesch in charge of the new club led to the name change to FC Brussels, and caused a split in the fanbase. During their years as FC Brussels, the Ultra group Brussels Power 05 emerged, while many of the \\"old school\\" casuals \\"Brussels Boys\\" boycotted.

History In 1924, Balanchine left the Soviet Union and joined Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris as a choreographer and ballet master.Bernard Taper, Balanchine: A Biography (New York: Times Books, 1984). After the death of Diaghilev in 1929, Lincoln Kirstein persuaded him to come to the United States in 1934. There, with Kirstin as his partner, he founded the School of American Ballet in New York City.Jennifer Dunning, \\"But First a School\\": The First Fifty Years of the School of American Ballet (New York: Viking, 1985). During his time in Europe, Balanchine had begun to develop his neoclassical style, partially as a reaction to the Romantic anti-classicism that had led to increased theatricality in ballet. His style focused more on dance movement and construction in relation to music than on plot or characterization. After he came to America, established his school, and eventually founded the New York City Ballet, he continued to refine the principles of training his dancers.Barbara Walczak and Una Kai, Balanchine the Teacher: Fundamentals That Shaped the First Generation of New York City Ballet Dancers (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2008). During the course of his career, in which he choreographed more than 450 ballets, he continued to develop his style and technique of training.Suki Schorer on Balanchine Technique (New York: Knopf, 1999).

Suki Schorer has described the Balanchine arabesque as \\"longer, stronger and bigger\\". Balanchine would instruct students to \\"reach for diamonds\\" in both directions so the dancer's hands are not relaxed, creating an elongated line.

Four months after capital controls were imposed on 28 June 2015, two important modifications were published by the government: while still limiting withdrawals to ‚Ç¨420 per week, account holders could withdraw the whole sum in one transaction instead of up to only ‚Ç¨60 per day, thus significantly reducing the amount of time spent queueing at the banks and ATMs, and, furthermore, up to 10% could be withdrawn from funds deposited in Greece from abroad. To minimize the impact on tourism, people with foreign credit cards such as tourists could withdraw through ATMs higher amounts of cash. Other changes allowed time deposits to be terminated prematurely to cover real estate purchases and living expenses up to ‚Ç¨1800 per month. Furthermore, resident Greeks making payments or remittances to foreign banks in which they had accounts in their name had the ‚Ç¨1800 limit removed and businesses making payments abroad could send up to ‚Ç¨5000 per day per client without seeking special permission. Still, the impact on business was dramatic as many exporters could not import the raw materials they needed for production as payments above the limits had to be approved by special committees who could approve imports of only ‚Ç¨20 million per day in total with priority on medicines and food. Six months into capital controls saw a further easing of the rules. While full or partial premature repayment of loans was still not generally allowed, the premature repayment of loans could be made by loan holders either through funds from abroad or by taking out a new loan to cover the amounts due on previous outstanding loans; additionally, loan holders could pay back the whole loan if the property was to be sold. Moreover, although still limited to ‚Ç¨420 of withdrawals per week, special exemptions could be made to pay administration fees and debts to the state. In December 2015, the finance ministry also signed off on measures that were designed to bolster the ailing Greek stock markets. Investors could now use \\"old money\\", (i.e. from their Greek bank accounts) to make transactions on the stock market in addition to the previously allowed \\"new money\\" from abroad or from the sale of stocks or other financial assets such as dividends from stocks. Following the first successful review of Greece's 3rd bailout memorandum of August 2015 by the state's creditors in June 2016 and in its \\"11th ministerial decision on capital controls\\" since imposition, on 22 July 2016 the Greek government's Finance Ministry announced that \\"new cash\\" deposited in Greek banks from abroad would be free of any limit on withdrawals to encourage more of the money withdrawn (est. ‚Ç¨50 billion, much of which found its way into safe deposit boxes or under mattresses) in the run-up to capital controls to find its way back into the Greek banking system which had already witnessed a ‚Ç¨4.5 billion increase in deposits to ‚Ç¨127 billion in the two months following the successful review as market jitters calmed. The decision also raised the limit on \\"old cash\\" withdrawals to ‚Ç¨840 per two weeks instead of ‚Ç¨420 per week. Finally, and in addition to first-year university students moving away from home to study and who already had previously been given permission to open bank accounts, Erasmus students and pensioners living abroad were also given permission to open new bank accounts in Greek banks. Still, the limit on cash for individuals travelling abroad remained at ‚Ç¨2000.  Effects of capital controls on card transactions  The effects of capital controls changed customer payment habits. Since the controls on withdrawals did not apply to the use of credit/debit cards to make purchases in Greek retail outlets, the average use of credit card transactions jumped from 4.5% to 19.5% in a relatively short time and up to 35% in supermarket transactions with more than 50% of people saying according to the Bank of Greece that they used their cards more than in the past, all of which left a paper trail that the Greek government was keen to encourage in its combat against tax evasion, despite the fact that the general use of credit transactions is believed to drive up the overhead for businesses and ultimately increase the price of goods and services for consumers. Before capital controls, in 2014, on average every Greek citizen used cards for transactions, not including ATMs, on average 8 times per year (‚Ç¨428 per year) against a 93-time European Union average (‚Ç¨3947 per year), while in 2015 the numbers rose to 20 times per year per citizen (‚Ç¨818 per year) and representing ‚Ç¨9 billion, double that of the previous year.  Prognosis on the end of capital controls  Despite positive pronouncements by bank insiders and the government that capital controls could be soon lifted or at least by the end of 2016, more than a year after their imposition, capital controls were still largely in place, unlike the example of Cyprus after the Cypriote crisis precipitated in March 2013 and who had largely eliminated their capital controls in April 2014 just over one year after the crisis had erupted. It must, however, be emphasized that the Cypriote crisis was more of a banking crisis than a state debt crisis and therefore not entirely analogous. Fears of a complete default of the Greek Banking system are still advanced by credit rating agencies should capital controls be completely removed, despite continuing credit rating upgrades.

Such images are most likely to be spread via social media, blogs, and websites of anti-brand activists such as Adbusters. They are often intended to highlight ethical issues regarding the product advertised and are commonly associated with the brand's lack of authenticity. The purpose of creating doppelg√§nger brand images is to expose the true nature/effects of the company at stake, since it is believed to promote untruthful claims about its products. The word Doppelganger comes from two German words Doppel and Ganger. Doppel means double and ganger means walker. Thus a doppelganger is a double walker. This was based on a belief that people have an alter ego that looks like them, but is ghost like in nature and if they encounter doppelganger face to face , bad things will happen. A 2012 study concluded that doppelg√§nger brand images were able to negatively affect sales, because they created a perception of mistrust in the minds of the customers.Markus Giesler: Craig J. ThompsonDoppelg√§nger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic Journal of Marketing, 76, November 2012, S. 55‚Äì68 A 2006 study concluded that, Doppleganger has an impact on emotional brand image of a brand. ' Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg√§nger Brand Image Journal of Marketing, Vol. 70, No. 1 (Jan., 2006), pp. 50-64 In a 2006 paper, Craig J. Thompson, Aric Rindfleisch and Zeynep Arsel suggest that doppelg√§nger brand images are a sign that \\"an emotional-branding story is beginning to lose its cultural resonance\\", and can be useful as a warning symptom. Usually when customers perceive a brand is inauthentic they are more motivated to create Doppelg√§nger brand image. Generally customers perceive a brand as inauthentic because of two primary reasons. The first reason is imitation-when customers start to feel that a particular brand is trying to copy the basic ideology of another brand they lose trust in that brand. The second case is when there is a mismatch between the existing image of the brand and the promotional activities of the brand. This happened in the case of McDonalds when they tried to portray themselves as an eating joint with healthy food choices. Usually, the brands that face Doppelganger brand campaigns are the big and more popular ones, which have a large customer base and more reach. Examples * The \\"Joe Chemo\\" campaign, an internet campaign created by an organization called Adbusters, criticized the product message of Camel cigarettes, and emphasized the harmful effects of smoking, by depicting the company's camel mascot as \\"a camel who wishes he'd never smoked cigarettes\\".. In this doppelganger image the confident, cool and popular Joe Camel is replaced by this sick, depressed and lonely Joe Chemo. Shortly after this doppelganger campaign began, Joe Camel was withdrawn from the market. * McDonald's is often criticized because of its harmful effects on human health. To illustrate its negative effect, the McDonald's logo was redesigned as \\"McDiabetes\\". For this DBI, there is a long running hashtag on twitter.https://twitter.com/hashtag/mcdiabetes?lang=en. * In 2015, a designer reinterpreted the Pepsi logo to represent a corpulent man. The intention was to emphasize the direct relation between consumption of sweetened soft drinks and obesity. * After General Motors launched the Hummer H2 in the mid-2000s, a creative viral Internet campaign called \\"FUH2\\" began. This campaign concentrated not only on the brand itself, but also on its owners who were portrayed as savages who cared about style more than the environment. * During Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, comedian John Oliver satirised Trump's \\"Make America Great Again\\" slogan with the parody \\"Make Donald Drumpf Again\\", referring to Trump's alleged ancestral surname. * Nike's logo and slogan (\\"Just do it\\") appear in several images either altered or adjusted, often highlighting the company's use of sweat shop labor. * Following the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, several satirical logos reflecting a negative image were born out of a contest sponsored by Greenpeace. * The South Butt was an attempt to commercialize a parody of The North Face's brand. *The Indian Premier League major cricket sporting event was severely criticized as Indian Puppet League, after revelations came out in 2015 regarding the match fixing and mis-governance issues associated with it. This negative portrayal of brand affected the events popularity and the credibility of associated players. The Board of Control for Cricket in India was also severely affected.http://iasir.net/AIJRHASSpapers/AIJRHASS15-799.pdf See also * Culture jammingThompson, Craig J., Aric Rindfleisch, and Zeynep Arsel (2006), \\"Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the D√∂ppelganger Brand Image\\" Journal of Marketing, 70 (January), 50-64 * Subvertising References Advertising Brand management Culture jamming techniques ","title":"Doppelg√§nger brand image"},{"id":"48753532","text":"Siege of Hulst may refer to: * Siege of Hulst (1591), a Dutch and English victory led by Maurice of Orange * Siege of Hulst (1596), a Spanish victory led by Archduke Albert * Siege of Hulst (1645), a Dutch victory led by Frederick Henry ","title":"Siege of Hulst"},{"id":"48753537","text":"Guilty as Sin is the thirteenth studio album by the British heavy metal band Girlschool, released in 2015.

Built in 1825 for a prominent local businessman John Holbrook, it is a high-quality example of Federal period architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Holbrook House is located north of downtown Brattleboro, at the northwest corner of Linden and Chapin Streets, across from the town common. Linden Street is a major continuation of Brattleboro's Main Street. The house is a roughly L-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. Its front facade, facing Linden Street, has a projecting three-bay section with angled sides, with similar single-story gabled porches set in front of each bay. The porches are supported by slender smooth round Ionic columns set on high square posts, with the adjoining posts joined at the top of the post. The entrance is set on the rightmost bay, topped by a Federal style fanlight. The gable above the projecting section is flushboarded, with a sunburst motif at the center. The house was built in 1825 for John Holbrook by Nathaniel Bliss, a local carpenter, and was apparently designed by Bliss as well. Holbrook, a Massachusetts native, worked in what is now southern Vermont as a surveyor, and eventually became part-owner of a general store in Newfane. He expanded his business interests, importing and exporting goods from Brattleboro via the Connecticut River, and was one of the owners of the first flat-bottomed boat to ply that river. A son of John Holbrook, Frederick Holbrook, became the 27th governor of Vermont.

He was a strong believer in the value of the peasant-owned family farm, and promoted the \\"back to the land\\" policies of Marshal Philippe P√©tain during the war. Agricultural expert (1876‚Äì1939) Pierre Caziot was born in Cr√©zancy-en-Sancerre, Cher, on 24 September 1876. Caziot ran a farm there that his family had owned for nearly 600 years. He became well known as a farmer and agricultural engineer, and was a member of the Academy of Agriculture. In 1919 he attacked the agrarian collectivism that the Left was advocating, and the move towards large, mechanized farms that some technocrats favored. Both would turn peasants into an agrarian proletariat. He argued that for a peasant to be attached to the soil he had to own his plot of land. In 1920 he wrote a tract in which he asserted that the family farm was the perfect basis for sound agriculture and a healthy nation. The state should consolidate land units that were too small and break up large units into farms suitable for one family. He also called for regional land societies. The state-subsidized societies would be organization by farmers associations. They would have the power to buy and restructure farmland as it became available and resell it on easy terms to peasant farmers or the sons of peasants. The proposal was reviewed favorably by the committee on agriculture of the Chamber of Deputies, but was not put to the vote. Caziot joined the Cr√©dit Foncier in 1924. He became a high official in the Credit Foncier, the government land bank that Napoleon III had established. World War II (1939‚Äì45) Ministerial appointments Caziot was named Minister of Agriculture and Supplies on 12 July 1940. He learned of his appointment from a neighbor, who had heard the news on the radio. Caziot hesitated to accept the unexpected offer of the Ministry of Agriculture, since he was deeply hostile to the Germans, but soon overcame his scruples. He insisted that a separate ministry take responsibility for the supply of food. Caziot was Minister of Agriculture and Supplies from 12 July 1940 to 6 September 1940, then Secretary of State for Agriculture and Supplies from 6 September 1940 to 13 December 1940 in the government of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. In December 1940 the secretariat of supplies was detached from the ministry. Caziot was Minister and Secretary of State for Agriculture from 13 December 1940 to 18 April 1942 in the governments of P√©tain and Fran√ßois Darlan. He was succeeded by Jacques Le Roy Ladurie, who was also a passionate agrarian. Le Roy Ladurie was younger, and more of a progressive corporatist. Return to the land Caziot believed in regionalism, seeing the traditional provinces as natural cultural and economic units, which he said were \\"drawn from the very entrails of the soil.\\" He promoted the \\"return to the land\\" and implemented measures to curb migration to the cities and to encourage creation of family farms. Caziot wrote of the challenge he faced when he took office, Caziot offered subsidies to peasants if they returned from the cities to work on unused land, provided loans on easy terms for modernization of rural houses, created a law on education to train more agronomists and to give rural children in basic education in agricultural technology, and implemented reforms to discourage the break-up of farms and to encourage the regrouping of scattered land holdings. Caziot said after the war, \\"It was necessary to concentrate all my efforts on the task of giving the farm families of France a realization of their strength and a new pride in their life, for they and they alone were to preserve France and to bring it to a re-birth whatever happened.\\" Peasant Corporation Caziot promulgated the law of 2 December 1940 that organized the Peasant Corporation. Although he was in favor of a national peasant organization, he accepted the word \\"corporation\\" only at P√©tain's insistence. The concept was that each community would have a \\"corporative syndicate\\" of all peasant families, grouped into regional \\"corporative unions\\" which would meet periodically in a National Corporative Council. Caziot lacked enthusiasm for corporatism and delayed implementation of the Peasant Corporation. He appointed a provisional national organizing committee on 21 January 1941. His commission, headed by Count Herv√© Budes de Gu√©briant, was mostly made up of leading conservative landowners and took nearly two years to develop the legislation that became effective on 16 December 1942. Jewish question In October 1941 Caziot wrote to the Commissioner-General for Jewish Questions, Xavier Vallat, protesting against the effect his Aryanization and spoliation measures were having on the productivity of Jewish farmers and agricultural projects. In December 1941 Vallat proposed in the State Council a motion to reduce participation of Jews in agriculture, limiting them to a single plot of land and banning them from positions of responsibility. Caziot opposed the law, which he felt was against the best interests of the nation due to the agricultural crisis. In January 1942 he said individuals should be encouraged to return to the land whatever their \\"race or religion\\". In January 1942 he forced Vallat to make an exception for the Jews of Vaucluse, who had lived there for centuries. Caziot's sole priority was to boost agricultural output. He wanted to keep the best qualified people in each job whatever their religion. He often succeeded in keeping Jews in senior positions in agriculture in defiance of Vallat's rulings. However, he had no interest in helping Jews unless they were useful in agriculture. In November 1941 he protested against the release of Jews who had no agricultural training from foreign workers' camps to work on projects for the Mission for the Restoration of Farming. Last years (1945‚Äì53) Caziot was tried by the High Court on 19 March 1947 for his participation in the Vichy government and sentenced to national degradation for life and loss of his property. He was pardoned after a telegram from Otto Abetz was found in the Nazi archives demanding his arrest for hostility to collaboration. He died in Paris on 4 January 1953.

Sobantu (who in the 1930s was \\"an emerging member of Southern Rhodesia's Westernized African elite\\"), was one of the chairmen of the residents' association.

This led to a demand for better housing in better neighborhoods, and \\"both the government and employers began to pay more serious attention to the housing problems of urban blacks\\".

KSUM was primarily founded to undertake the planning, establishment, and management of the Technology Business Incubator (TBI), a startup accelerator in Kerala, to promote technology-based entrepreneurship activities, and to create the infrastructure and environment required to support high-technology-based businesses. Additional goals of KSUM include: * coordinating the functions of other incubators in the state * strengthening the entrepreneurship development activities of the state government * promoting knowledge-driven and technology-based startup ventures by students, faculties, and local entrepreneurs * planning and implementing linkages with industry and networking activities * setting up Research and Development facilities * encouraging the formation of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cells (IEDCs) and technoparks in academic institutions, and capacity building programmes for human resources.  Incubation programme  KSUM supports entrepreneurs in developing technology-based business ventures, for example startups with high-technology products. A startup's early development can usually be divided into three stages, pre-incubation (3-6 months), incubation (6-12 months) and an accelerator stage (3-6 months). The pre-incubation stage mainly focuses on ideation of a potentially innovative idea. During the incubation stage, startup companies begin product development and prepare themselves for marketing. KSUM provides the startups with modular space, any applicable grants or funding, and mentorship. They also provide services such as entrepreneur training and workshops. In the accelerator stage KSUM offers a business tool box and a business advisory service, resembling traditional management consulting or mentoring. KSUM will assist the startup in presentations to venture capitalists and investors.  KSUM - EY Accelerator  KSUM has collaborated with Ernst & Young to develop a Business & Technology Accelerator providing fully equipped and functional office space of 1500 sq.ft at the KINFRA Film & Video Park, Thiruvananthapuram. The objective is to offer technology and business leadership and mentorship support for selected start- ups incubated in the state of Kerala. Start-ups are offered a six-month acceleration programme (extendable to 12 months) to increase the business sophistication and skills of selected entrepreneurs. The programme encompasses mentorship support in all areas of business and technology including business strategy, finance, human resources, investment proposals, emerging technology trends, and market research. The accelerator programme will also support entrepreneurs to network with industry captains, angel investors, venture capitalists and so on.  FAB Labs  With the support of the Government of Kerala, KSUM has started two MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) USA Electronics Fabrication Laboratories, commonly called Fab Labs, at the Technopark, Trivandrum and the Kerala Technology Innovation Zone (KTIZ), Kochi. The location in Technopark, Trivandrum is inside the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala (IIITM-K). A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention which aims to provide a stimulus for local entrepreneurship and serves as a platform for learning and innovation. It is a small scale workshop offering digital fabrication that empowers the users to create smart devices which can be tailored to local or personal needs. The Fab Lab is also a way for local entrepreneurs to connect to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers and innovators. The entrepreneur thus becomes part of a self-sustaining global knowledge-sharing network. The Fab Lab programme aims to encourage startups in printed electronics and other such fields in Kerala. This project is a collaboration between KSUM and the Center for Bits and Atoms Fab Lab Foundation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Other Programmes   Learn To Code (Raspberry Pi Program)  The Kerala government launched the initiative \\"Learn to Code\\" in 2015. During phase 1 of the initiative, 2500 Raspberry Pi computer programming kits were distributed to class VIII students (14 years old). The project‚Äôs aim is to add 40,000 talented young programmers to the maker community being developed through programmes initiated by KSUM. Subsequently, KSUM and the IT@School Project initiated the Kerala Raspberry Pi Competition for students who received the Raspberry Pi kit.  Startup Box  In 2015, the Kerala government introduced the 'Startup Box Programme' for aspiring entrepreneurs through KSUM. The Startup Box consists of documents required to start a company, plus key technologies including an arduino starter kit. The Startup Box Programme will be given to up to 50 teams composed of college students annually.

Since 2003, Imam Qasim has been managing AKF from concept to delivery of projects, from fundraising to feedback reports, managing donors, staff and volunteers around the world. Before founding AKF, Imam Qasim had graduated in the Islamic sciences and was previously an imam and community/faith leader at the Croydon Mosque. He also worked as a counsellor and teacher for reforming prisoners for nearly a decade at Her Majesty's Prisons.  Background and interests   Background  Imam Qasim was born in Saharanpur, India and educated in Pangani, Nairobi and finished his studies at the Dewsbury Institute of Islamic Education in the UK. Imam Qasim speaks in Urdu, Arabic, and English.  Interests  Imam Qasim is interested in the following causes: * Education * Health * Children * Disaster relief * Humanitarian Relief * Economic Empowerment * Poverty Alleviation * Science and Technology * Social Services  Education  Imam Qasim undertook his initial level education and began memorising the Quran in 1977 to 1980, in Pangani, Nairobi. During these years he also played sports. From 1984 to 1993, Imam Qasim attended the Dewsbury Institute of Islamic Education as a student of deen, and eventually became a scholar. He studied the Quran, Arabic, Fiqh, Hadith, Islamic History, Seerah and other Islamic subjects in the Arabic language. During these years, Imam Qasim also managed various tasks and events.  Experience   Visiting Imam at HMP prison services  Imam Qasim worked as a counsellor and teacher for reforming prisoners for nearly a decade at Her Majesty's Prisons. There he engaged in counselling and teaching the offenders, looking after their welfare and helping them to reform and not return to criminal activity after their release from prison.  Chairman and Founder of Al-Khair Foundation (AKF)  Imam Qasim named the foundation, ‚ÄòAl-Khair‚Äô, which is translated to mean ‚Äògoodness‚Äô in Arabic. Imam Qasim created and managed AKF as an Islamic school in Croydon in 2003. It evolved into a service organisation to the UK community first, with an initial focus on education, and also charity work. The Islamic school began with five enrolled pupils. The sports hall was previously a converted warehouse and the school itself was previously an office. By 2013, the school grew into a primary and secondary school with over 350 pupils. AKF then began to build schools overseas for orphans and children from underprivileged communities. This led to AKF's work with widows and vulnerable women, and then to the establishment of the AKF shelters. Eventually AKF launched their water aid and livelihood projects, as well as the AKF medical aid programmes. In 2005, AKF launched their first Overseas Disaster Relief venture to provide emergency aid during the Kashmir earthquake. That October, and in the winter months which followed, AKF's relief teams provided survivors with medicine, food, shelter kits and moral support. Ever since, AKF has undertaken emergency aid missions all over the world. In this year Al-Khair school also passed their first Ofsted inspection. In 2010, AKF was a founding member of the Muslim Charities Forum.Al-Khair Foundation Ramadan 2015 leaflet- 'This Ramadan save lives' AKF has supported the victims of many earthquakes, including the Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods of 2010, the horn of Africa famine relief, and the Japan earthquake of 2011. Their work in Haiti was recognised by the United Nations in 2010, and they were the only UK Muslim charity working with survivors on the ground in the Japan earthquake of 2011. In 2012, AKF created their first official partnership- a MoU with Malaysian Red Crescent. In July 2015, AKF also signed a MoU with the UN to facilitate education for Gazan children. In 2014, the revenue made by AKF was ¬£21.4 million. The Foundation aims to save lives in emergencies and provide for disaster zones with medical aid, food shelter. It also aims to help the needy by adopting practical ways to root out poverty from the world through relief and development programmes in South Asia, the Middle-East, East Africa and United Kingdom. Today, Imam Qasim is largely involved in AKF's work in the UK, and internationally. He established and oversees many of the charity's aid and development programmes to date.  Campaigns  AKF's ‚ÄôLet's Rebuild Pakistan‚Äô campaign was one of the largest international relief efforts in the Foundation's history. To publicise this programme, in the summer of 2011, the Imam cycled from John O‚ÄôGroatsin Scotland to Land's End in Cornwall over thirty days. This was shown on the Foundation's dedicated television channel, IQRA TV, which broadcasts to one million households in the UK and helped raise ¬£2,000,000. Imam Qasim was also named Fundraiser of the Year 2011 by the ‚ÄòJustGiving‚Äô donation internet portal. More recently, IQRA TV has expanded to reach out to a Bangladeshi demographic through a new channel called IQRA Bangla.  IQRA TV  Imam Qasim is also the CEO of IQRA TV, which has come to be known as one of the UK's premier Muslim television broadcasters. In 2007, AKF established their first shelter project in Kashmir, and two years later AKF bought IQRA TV, a free-to-air channel available on Sky TV.

It is the type species of the genus Potexvirus. Description LVX is described in the 4th report of the ICTV (1982). It is found primarily in lilies, although more plants are susceptible, and the virus is thought to be only transmitted mechanically. There are no known vectors; however, the application of insecticides effectively reduced the spread of LVX, from which it may be gathered that the virus‚Äô transmission is insect-mediated.Asjes, C.J. (1991). Control of air- borne field spread of tulip breaking virus, lily symptomless virus and lily virus X in lilies by mineral oils, synthetic pyrethroids, and a nematicide in the Netherlands Netherlands Journal of Plant Path, 97(3), 129-138. Symptoms of this virus are as of yet unknown, obfuscating the capability to examine the extent of natural infection and spread. Structure This image shows helical segments of a filamentous plant virus.Kendall, A., McDonald, M., Bian, W., Bowles, T., Baumgarten, S. C., Shi, J., ‚Ä¶ Stubbs, G. (2008). Structure of Flexible Filamentous Plant Viruses. Journal of Virology, 82(19), 9546‚Äì9554.LVX is a non-enveloped virus with helical symmetry. All potexviruses, including LVX are believed to have slightly less than 9 protein subunits per helical turn.Kendall, A., McDonald, M., Bian, W., Bowles, T., Baumgarten, S. C., Shi, J., ‚Ä¶ Stubbs, G. (2008). Structure of Flexible Filamentous Plant Viruses. Journal of Virology, 82(19), 9546‚Äì9554. This pattern of nucleocapsid formation causes the nucleocapsid to be an elongated, flexible, filamentous virus like most plant viruses. Unlike other potexviruses (average length of 550 nm), LVX has a length of 470 nm and a width of 13 nm.Stone, O.M. (1980). Two new potexviruses from monocotyledons. Acta Hort. 110, 59-63. LVX is distinguishable from lily symptomless carlavirus (LSV) by serological tests, such as immunogold labeling tests.Yang, T. (1997). Cytological Characteristics and detection of viruses of Lilium Spp. (Doctoral dissertation). University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Genome Potexvirus genome replication and mRNA synthesis, displaying the RdRp, TGBp1/2/3, and coat proteins. The LVX genome consists of one single stranded (+)RNA sequence of 5.9-7 kilobases in size. The genome contains only three Open Reading Frames (ORFs), coding for five proteins (RdRp, TGBp1, TGBp2, TGBp3, CP).Memelink, J., van der Vlugt, C.I.M., Linthorst, H.J.M., Derks, A.F.L.M., Asjes, C.J., Bol, J.F. (1990). Homologies between the genomes of a carlavirus (lily symptomless virus) and a potexvirus (lily virus X) from lily plants. Journal of General Virology, 71, 917-924. The 5‚Äô end is capped and the 3‚Äô terminus is polyadenylated. These proteins are 24 kilodaltons (kDa), 12 kDa, and 22 kDa, with the third being the coat protein, while also encoding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).Memelink, J., van der Vlugt, C.I.M., Linthorst, H.J.M., Derks, A.F.L.M., Asjes, C.J., Bol, J.F. (1990). Homologies between the genomes of a carlavirus (lily symptomless virus) and a potexvirus (lily virus X) from lily plants. Journal of General Virology, 71, 917-924. The stop codon of the 24 kDa ORF and the start codon of the 12 kDa ORF overlap one another. While many potexvirus genomes contain a small ORF that is immediately 5‚Äô of this coat protein ORF, this is not found in the LVX genome. This difference is surprising as this ORF has been identified in at least six other potexvirus genomes. However, when looking at the proteins encoded by LVX and other potexviruses, there were significant similarities between the amino acid sequences. At the 5‚Äô end of LVX, there is a truncated ORF, which encodes for a polypeptide which contains a GDD motif. This motif is also found in the C-terminal end of proteins encoded by other potexviruses. Examination of the 24 kDa protein of LVX reveals that it contains a nucleoside triphosphate binding motif (GXXGXGKS/T). This motif also found in the lily symptomless virus 25 kDa protein, as well as the 25-26 kDa proteins of other potexviruses, such as potato virus X and potato virus S. LVX also contains a supposed potexvirus subgenomic promoter sequence (GGTTAAGTT---GAA) upstream (5‚Äô) of the 24 kDa protein. This sequence is also found upstream of initiation codons of coat proteins in similar viruses, most notably lily symptomless virus. Researchers looked at LVX-infected lily leaves and found the presence of subgenomic RNAs. These RNAs were about 2000 and 850 nucleotides in length, which matched up with the presumed subgenomic promoters. From this, it was determined that they likely function as messengers for both the 24 kDa and 22 kDa proteins (coat protein). In the LVX sequence, there is a region between the 12 kDa ORF and the 22 kDa (coat protein) ORF that is not translated. In other potexvirus sequences, this region contains respective 7 kDa and 11 kDa ORFs; however, in this region of the LVX sequence, there is an uninterrupted reading frame. This reading frame begins at nucleotide position 1236 and ends at position 1646. If this region were to be translated, the protein encoded would be similar to the 7 kDa and 11 kDa proteins mentioned above, ending 18 nucleotides inside of LVX's coat protein ORF. Translation of this LVX ORF does not get translated because the genome is missing an initiation codon. Triple Gene Block 1 (TGBp1) is a multifunctional protein. It acts to promote translation of viral RNAs by acting as an RNA helicase, separating double- stranded RNA for RdRp functions. Moreover, it can act as a suppressor of RNA interference, which is an immune defense against the accumulation of viral RNAs.Lubicz-Verchot, J. (2005). A New Cell-to-Cell Transport Model for Potexviruses. Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 18(4), 283-290. TGBp1 transports the viral genome to adjacent plant cells directly through plasmosdesmata, allowing for efficient propagation by circumventing the host‚Äôs cell wall barrier.Lubicz-Verchot, J. (2005). A New Cell-to-Cell Transport Model for Potexviruses. Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 18(4), 283-290. TGBp1 also increases plasmodesmal size exclusion limits, allowing the viral genome to pass more easily from one cell to another. Finally, it suppresses RNA silencing, preventing the host from disabling the RNA genome. TGBp2 and TGBp3 are membrane binding proteins involved in attachment and entry. TGBp3 is expressed through leaky scanning of the TGBp2 subgenomic mRNA. The TGBp2 ORF has a weak initiation codon that is sometimes skipped by the ribosome in translation initiation. In this instance, the 40S ribosomal subunit continues to scan until it encounters the initiation codon of TGBp3 and begins translation. CP is the coat protein of LVX that forms ribonucleoprotein complexes along with TGBp1 and viral mRNA. ‚ÄúThe nucleotide sequence of LVX appears to be unique among potexviruses inasmuch as it apparently lacks the small open reading frame, 5‚Äô to the coat protein cistron, common to all other potexvirus.‚ÄùYang, T. (1997). Cytological Characteristics and detection of viruses of Lilium Spp. (Doctoral dissertation). University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. In addition, the TGBp3 region of the genome lacked a normal start codon.Chen, J., Shi, Y.-H., Adams, M.J., Chen, J.-P. (2005).

The complete sequence of the genomic RNA of an isolate of Lily virus X (genus Potexvirus). Archives of Virology, 150(4), 825-832. Replication LVX does not have a known vector, but it most likely spreads and enters the cell through mechanical inoculation by insects. The replication of LVX, like other ssRNA(+) viruses, occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. Once the virus enters into the host cell, the virus is uncoated and releases the viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral monocistronic RNA is then translated into RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the 5‚Äô-proximal ORF. The replication of LVX occurs in viral factories which are organized by the protein TGBp1.Yang, T. (1997). Cytological Characteristics and detection of viruses of Lilium Spp. (Doctoral dissertation). University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. TGBp1 works to rearrange the actin and endomembranes of the host and creates an assembly of helical arrangements. These helical structures are surrounded by the host endomembranes, which create a region where the virus can replicate more efficiently.Lubicz-Verchot, J. (2005). A New Cell-to-Cell Transport Model for Potexviruses. Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 18(4), 283-290. The replication of the ssRNA(+) virus generates a dsRNA(+) virus, which is then further transcribed and replicated to create more LVX mRNAs and ssRNA(+) genomes, respectively. Subgenomic promoters on the virus lead to translation of sgRNAs, which results in the formation of capsid and movement proteins. These are used to arrange the virion structure and organize the viral genomes. New virus particles are then able to be produced and assembled. With the help of LVX‚Äôs triple gene block proteins, these completed particles can traverse long distances among plasmodesmata and shorter, intercellular spaces in order to infect other host cells.Yang, T. (1997). Cytological Characteristics and detection of viruses of Lilium Spp. (Doctoral dissertation). University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida. Associated Disease LVX has no known associated diseases. Symptoms There are no known outstanding symptoms that arise in LVX‚Äôs natural host range of Lilium formosanum; however, Yang (1997) found that LVX- infected lilies grow more slowly and tend to be smaller than uninfected specimens. Mechanical inoculation of other susceptible plant species, such as Tetragonia tetragonioides and Chenopodium murale, result in chlorotic local lesions.Stone, O.M. (1980). Two new potexviruses from monocotyledons. Acta Hort. 110, 59-63. Tropism Although not seen in nature, lab tests have shown that LVX is able to infect several other plants beyond Lilium formosanum.Stone, O.M. (1980). Two new potexviruses from monocotyledons. Acta Hort. 110, 59-63. Other species that have been shown to be susceptible are: * Chenopodium capitatum * Chenopodium murale * Chenopodium quinoa * Gomphrena globosa * Lilium formosanum * Nicotiana benthamiana * Nicotiana clevelandii * Tetragonia tetragonioides LVX is able to infect all tissues of the lily plant. Virions have been cytopathologically detected in all parts of the host plants and contain approximately 5% nucleic acid and 95% protein, with no lipid contents.Stone, O.M. (1980). Two new potexviruses from monocotyledons. Acta Hort. 110, 59-63. The mode of transmission is expected to be that of mechanical inoculation through insect vectors, since the spread of the virus was inhibited by insecticides but not mineral-oil sprays.Asjes, C.J.

It was noted for its choral music in the 12th century, for its role in the development of ballet during the Renaissance, in the 19th century it became famous for its music halls and cabarets, and in the 20th century for the first performances of the Ballets Russes, its jazz clubs, and its part in the development of serial music. Paris has been home to many important composers, to name a few: Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Niccol√≤ Piccinni, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Jacques Offenbach, Georges Bizet, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Hector Berlioz, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Faur√©, C√©sar Franck, Charles Gounod, Jules Massenet, Vincent d'Indy, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, Sidney Bechet... Music of medieval Paris The cathedral schools and choral music Kyrie from Messe de Nostre Dame composed by Guillaume de Machaut, about 1350 In the Middle Ages, music was an important part of the ceremony in Paris churches and at the royal court. The Emperor Charlemagne had founded a school at the first cathedral of Notre Dame in 781, whose students chanted during the mass; and the court also had a school, the schola palatina, which traveled wherever the imperial court went, and whose students took part in the religious services at the Royal Chapel. Large monasteries were founded on the Left Bank at Saint- Germain-des-Pr√©s, Sainte-Genevi√®ve, and Saint-Victor, which taught the art of religious chanting, adding more elaborate rhythms and rimes. When the new Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris was constructed, the Notre Dame school became famous for its innovations in vocal counterpoint, or polyphony. The Archdeacon Albert of the Notre Dame school became famous for composing the first known work for three voices, each chanting a different part at the same time. Another famous teacher at the Notre Dame school, P√©rotin, composed for four different voices, with highly complex rhythms, blending all the voices together in ways never heard before. In the 13th century, the monks of the Notre Dame school developed an even more complex form, the motet, or \\"little word\\"; short pieces for two or three voices, each chanting different words, and sometimes in different languages. The motet became so popular that it was used in non-religious music, in the court and even by musicians and singers on the streets. A second important music school was established at the Sainte- Chapelle, the royal chapel on the √éle de la Cit√©. Its choir had twenty-five persons, both men and boys, who were taught chanting and vocal techniques. The music of the religious schools became popular outside the churches; the melodies of chants were adapted for popular songs, and sometimes popular song melodies were adapted for church use. Prior to the ninth century there were no written manuscripts of liturgy related to music. The Gallic music of the churches of Gaul was replaced by the plain songs traced to Rome. In the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. A group of Parisian aristocrats, known as trouv√®res, became known for their poetry and songs. Choral polyphony is a musical genre which was introduced in the 15th century in the Western church music culture. At Notre-Dame, this culture became intertwined as its construction progressed. Composition of music and poetry was a culture that prevailed in the cathedral among its canons and dignitaries. In the cathedral, polyphony and organ music were reserved for solemn occasions at a time when acoustics were not well developed. Organizing of the music group in the cathedral was such that the polyphonic vocal choir singing musicians were set behind the tapestries whereas the organ was placed in the nave. Before the 16th century all music performed in the cathedral was a cappella, except for use of organ while chanting. One of the most famous Paris composers of the 14th century was Guillaume de Machaut, who was also renowned as a poet. He composed a famous mass, the Messe de Nostre Dame, or Mass of our Lady, in about 1350, for four voices. Besides church music, he wrote popular songs in the style of the troubadours and trouv√®res. Street singers and minstrels Jongleurs and minstrels at a wedding banquet (1350‚Äì55) (French National Library) The crowds on the streets, squares and markets of Paris were often entertained by singers of different kinds. The goliards were non-conformist students at the religious colleges, who led a bohemian life, and earned money for food and lodging by reciting poems and singing improvised songs, either love songs or satirical songs, accompanying themselves on medieval instruments. The trouv√©res sang popular songs, romantic or humorous, largely borrowed in style and content from the troubadours of southern France. They often entertained crowds gathered on the Petit Pont, the bridge connecting the √éle de la Cit√© with the left bank. They introduced a particular form, the rondeau, a round song. The Jongleurs were famous for burlesque songs, making fun of the merchants, clergy, and the nobility. Some of them became immensely popular, and received lodging and gifts from the nobles they amused. The Menestrels, (Minstrels), were usually street singers who had established a more professional means of living, entertaining in the palaces or residences of noble and wealthy Parisians. In 1321, thirty-seven minstrels and jongleurs formed a professional guild, the Confr√©rie de Saint- Julien des m√©n√©triers, the first union of musicians in Paris. Most of them played instruments: the violin, flute, hautbois, or tambourine. They played at celebrations, weddings, meetings, holiday events, and royal celebrations and processions. By their statutes enacted in 1341, no musician could play on the streets without their permission. In order to become a member, a musician had to be an apprentice for six years. At the end of the six years, the apprentice had to audition for a jury of master musicians. By 1407, the rules of the Confr√©rie were applied to all of France. Musicians were also an important part of court life. The court of Queen Anne of Brittany, wife of Charles VIII of France, in 1493 included three well-known composers of the period: Antonius Divitis, Jean Mouton, and Claudin de Sermisy, as well as a tambourine player, a lute player, two singers, a player of the rebec (a three-stringed instrument like a violin), an organist, and a player of the manichordion, as well as three minstrels from Brittany. Music of Renaissance Paris (16th century) Three young women making music, with a jester (about 1580) At the death of Charles VI in Paris in 1422, during the devastating Hundred Years' War which ended in 1453, the city had been occupied by the English and their Burgundian allies since 1418. The new (disinherited) French king, Charles VII, had his court established in Bourges, south of the Loire Valley, and did not return to his capital before liberating it in 1436. His successors chose to live in the Loire Valley, and rarely visited Paris. However, in 1515, after his coronation in Reims, king Francis I made his grand entrance in Paris and, in 1528, announced his intention to return the royal court there, and began reconstructing the Louvre as the royal residence in the capital. He also imported the Renaissance musical styles from Italy, and recruited the best musicians and composers in France for his court. La Musique de la Grande √âcurie (\\"Music of the Great Stable\\") was organized in 1515 to perform at royal ceremonies outdoors. It featured haut, or loud instruments, including trumpets, fifes, cornets, drums, and later, violins. A second ensemble, La musique de la Chambre du Roi (\\"Music of the King's Chamber\\") was formed in 1530, with bas or quieter instruments, including violas, flutes and lutes. A third ensemble, the oldest, the Chapelle royale, which performed at religious services and ceremonies, was also reformed on Renaissance models. Another important revolution in music was brought about by the invention of the printing press; the first printed book of music was made in 1501 in Venice. The first printed book of music in France was made in Paris by Pierre Attaingnant; his printing house became the royal musical house in 1538. After his death, Robert Ballard became the royal music printer. Ballard established a shop in Paris in 1551. The most popular musical instrument for wealthy Parisians to play was the lute, and Ballard produced dozens of books of lute songs and airs, as well as music books for masses and motets, and pieces from Italy and Spain. The most popular genre in Paris was the chanson: hundreds of them were written on love, work, battles, religion, and nature. Mary, Queen of Scots and wife of king Francis II wrote a song of mourning for the loss of her husband, and French poets, including Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay, had their sonnets and odes put to music. The most popular composers of songs included Cl√©ment Janequin, who wrote some two hundred and fifty pieces, and became Court composer, and Pierre Certon, who was a cleric at the Sainte- Chapelle while he wrote some three hundred chansons, ranging from religious and courtly music to popular melodies, such as the famous Sur le Pont d'Avignon. In the second part of the century, a variation of the chanson, the air de cour or simply air (melody), became popular. Airs were lighter in subject, and were accompanied by a lute. They became immensely popular in Paris. The Reformation and religious music A Protestant Huguenot book of psalms in French, set to music (1539) The movement of Protestant Reformation, led by Martin Luther in the Holy Roman Empire and John Calvin in France, had an important impact on music in Paris. Under Calvin's direction, between 1545 and 1550 books of psalms were translated from Latin into French, turned into songs, and sung at reformed services in Paris. The Catholic establishment reacted fiercely to the new movement; the songs were condemned by the College of Sorbonne, the fortress of orthodoxy, and in 1549 one Protestant tailor in Paris, Jacques Duval, was burned at the stake, along with his song book. When the campaign against the new songs proved ineffective, the Catholic Church, at the Council of Trent (1545-1563) which launched the Counter-Reformation, also launched a musical counter-reformation. It was calling for an end to complex but unintelligible chants, simpler melodies, and more serious and elevated lyrics. Ballet performance at the Louvre (1582) Music and the first theater companies The beginning of the 16th century saw the first theater performances in Paris, which frequently included music and songs. An amateur theater group called the Confr√©rie de la Passion was periodically performing Passion Plays, based on the Passion of Jesus, in a large hall on the ground floor of the Hospital of the Trinity (H√¥pital de la Trinit√©) on rue Saint- Denis, where it remained until 1539. In 1543, the group bought one of the buildings attached to the H√¥tel de Bourgogne at 23 rue √âtienne-Marcel, which became the first permanent theater in the city. The church authorities in Paris denounced Passion and religious mystery plays, which they banned in 1548. The Confr√©rie rented out its theater to visiting theater troupes, notably an English company directed by Jean Sehais, an Italian company called the Comici Gelosi (\\"Jealous Comedians\\"), and a French company headed by Valleran Le Conte. New instruments and the guild of instrument-makers The Renaissance saw a great increase in the number and quality of musical instruments: the harp, violin and flute were produced with many new variations, the seven-string guitar appeared, and the lute, which was based on the oud, an Arab instrument brought to the Iberian Peninsula during the Moorish invasions. The trumpet evolved to something similar to its present form. Powerful organs were built for Paris churches, as well as smaller portable organs and the clavichord, ancestor of the piano. The lute, most often used to accompany songs, became the instrument of choice for minstrels and musically-inclined aristocrats. In 1597, there were so many different instrument-makers in Paris that they, like the minstrels, were organized into a guild, which required six years of apprenticeship and the presentation of a master-work to be accepted as a full member. Dance and ballet A ball at the Valois Court (about 1580) Dance was also an important part of court life. The first French book of dance music was published in 1531 in Paris, with the title: \\"Fourteen gaillardes, nine pavanes, seven branles and two basses- danses\\". These French dance books, called Danceries, were circulated all over Europe. The names of the composers were rarely credited, with the exception of Jean d'Estr√©e,http://data.bnf.fr/13960212/jean_d__estree/ a member of the royal orchestra, who published four books of his dances in Paris between 1559 and 1574. At the end of the 16th century, the ballet became popular at the French court. Ballets were performed to celebrate weddings and other special occasions. The first performance of Circ√© by Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx was performed at the Louvre Palace on September 24, 1581, to celebrate the wedding of Anne de Joyeuse, a royal favourite of Henry III, with Marguerite de Vaud√©mont. Ballets at the French royal court combined elaborate costumes, dance, singing, and comedy. During the reign of Henry IV, ballets were often comic or exotic works; those performed during his reign included \\"The Ballet of the fools\\", \\"The Ballet of the drunkards\\", \\"The Ballet of the Turks\\", and \\"The Ballet of the Indians\\". 17th century - royal court music, ballet and opera One of the twenty-four violinists of the King, the first permanent court orchestra In the 17th century, music played an important part at the French royal court; there was no day without music. Louis XIII composed songs, and in 1618 organized the first permanent orchestra in France, called La Grande Bande or the Twenty-four ordinary violins of the King, who performed for royal balls, celebrations, and official ceremonies. His son, Louis XIV, an accomplished musician, was taught the guitar and the harpsichord by the best musicians of the period. In 1647, Jean-Baptiste Lully was brought to Paris from his native Florence to be in the service of La Grande Mademoiselle. In early 1653, he caught the attention of Louis XIV, who named him court composer for instrumental music. Under Lully, music became not simply entertainment, but an expression of royal majesty and power.The royal ministers, Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin encouraged the development of French music in place of the Italian style. In the families of the nobles and the wealthy, children were taught to sing and to play musical instruments, such as harp, flute, guitar, and harpsichord, either in the convent schools, or at home with private tutors. Louis XIV established the Royal Academy of Music (Acad√©mie royale de musique) in 1672, and commissioned Lully to create a music school, but a school for opera singers in Paris was not opened until 1714, and its quality was very poor; it closed in 1784. One notable music teacher and composer was Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res, Louis XIV's harpsichord teacher, whose compositions established the French school of harpsichord music. The Air de Cour, or Court Air, became very popular in the early 17th century, during the reign of Louis XIII, both at the royal court and in the palaces of the nobility and the wealthy. It was designed to be sung in a large room (chamber) where the nobility entertained their intimate friends. They usually were improvised songs on the themes of gallantry and love, in the form of a dialogue, performed with the lute and the th√©orbe. The composer Pierre Gu√©ron, music teacher to the children of the King, published several books of court airs, and trained Ang√©lique Paulet, the most famous Parisian singer of the early 17th century. The published songs were learned and sung by both nobles and wealthy Parisians. The debut of French opera Cardinal Mazarin, raised in Rome, was an enthusiastic supporter of Italian culture, and imported Italian painters, architects and musicians to work in Paris. In 1644, he invited the castrato Atto Melani to Paris, along with his brother Jacopo and the Florentine singer Francesca Costa, and introduced the Italian singing style to the French capital. The Italian style was much different than the French style of the day; voices were stronger and the singing expressed stronger emotions, rather than the finesse of the classical French style. The following year the first performance of an Italian opera, La finta pazza by Marco Marazzoli, at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal on February 28, 1645, followed in 1647 by the more famous Orfeo of Luigi Rossi at the Petit-Bourbon theater next to the Louvre. Torelli for La finta pazza, the first Italian opera performed in Paris (1645) The debut of Italian opera in Paris had exactly the opposite effect that Mazarin desired. As Parisian audiences were not prepared for a theatrical work that was entirely sung, the Cardinal was denounced and ridiculed by Parisian streets singers and pamphlets called mazarinades for spending a fortune on opera decoration and bringing Italian castrati and singers to Paris. Furthermore, during the disorders of the Fronde, Mazarin was forced to leave Paris. When calm was restored, he returned to the capital and carried forward his project to build an opera house. At the time the city had no theater to rival the opera houses of Venice or Rome and, in 1659, Mazarin began construction of the Salle des Machines, a new theater just to the north of Tuileries Palace, between the Marsan Pavilion and the chapel. It could seat six thousand persons, had marble columns, was lavishly decorated, and contained the elaborate machinery needed to produce dramatic stage effects. The death of Mazarin delayed the opening, but it was finally inaugurated in 1662 with an Italian opera, L'Ercole amante, by Cavalli. The premiere was a disaster: the acoustics in the new hall were terrible, and the sound of the stage machinery drowned out the music. A set by Torelli for the opera Orfeo by Luigi Rossi, reused for the play Androm√®de by Pierre Corneille at the Palais-Royal (1650) The efforts to create a French opera continued. The poet Pierre Perrin persuaded the new Controller General of Finances, Colbert, to establish an Academy of Opera, and in 1669 Perrin was given a commission by the king to create works \\"in music and in French verse comparable to that of Italy.\\" The first opera by Perrin, Pomone, with music by Robert Cambert, was performed on March 3, 1671, inside a converted Jeu de Paume, or tennis court, between the rue des Foss√©s de Nesles (now rue Mazarine) and the rue de Seine. It was an enormous success, running for one hundred forty-six performances. Seeing the success of Perrin's work, the official court composer, Lully, moved quickly; he persuaded the royal government to issue a decree banning any theatrical performances with more than two songs or two instruments without Lully's written permission. In 1671 alone, Lully wrote and presented five new operas. On November 15, 1672, he opened his own opera house in the jeu de paume du Bel-Air (also known as jeu de paume de B√©cquet). He also demanded and received from the king the exclusive rights to use the theater of the Palais- Royal, until then used by the theater company of Moli√®re, giving him control over any and all musical performances in Paris. He presented a new opera each year, entirely funded by the royal treasury. In April 1673, he premiered Cadmus et Hermione, the first French opera in the lyric-tragedy form. This form, which dominated French opera for the next two centuries, but was rarely exported, featured stories based on mythology and ancient heroes. The performances made maximum use of machinery, allowing the creation on stage of storms, monsters, and characters descending or ascending into the heavens. The texts involved recitation of verse in a classical half-spoken, half-sung style, borrowed from Racine and Corneille, with a vocal range of an octave, words mingled with sighs, exclamations and vibrato. The works included not only singing, but also dance. The operas were all dedicated to the glory of the Sun King: in the dedication of Armide, Lully wrote: \\"All of the praises of Paris are not enough for me; it is only to you, Sire, that I want to consecrate all the productions of my genius.\\" After 1672, Louis XIV no longer lived in Paris, preferring the royal residences of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Chambord, Fontainebleau, and finally Versailles where he and the court moved permanently in 1682. The royal musicians and opera singers went with him, and Versailles, not Paris, became the center of French musical life. Ballet Louis XIV in costume for the Ballet Royal de la Nuit (1653) During his residence in Paris, the young Louis XIV was an avid dancer and participant in ballet. Ballet was commonly practiced by young nobles, along with fencing and horsemanship. Only men danced, except in ballets given by the ladies of the Queen. Louis practiced several hours a day, and made his first ballet appearance in the Ballet de Cassandre at the age of thirteen. He was featured in the Ballet Royal de la Nuit, at the Petit-Bourbon theater, on 23 February 1653. This court ballet lasted 12 hours, from sundown until sunrise, and consisted of 45 dances. Louis XIV appeared in five of them, the most famous of which saw the young monarch in the role of Apollo, the Sun King, appearing as the Soleil levant (\\"rising Sun\\").(in French) With the arrival of the twenty- six-year-old Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court, the ballet began to take on a new dimension. Lully premiered his first Grand Ballet Royal, Alcidiane, on February 14, 1658, with the entire court in attendance. The performance, composed of seventy-nine different tableaux, or scenes, lasted several hours. In the 1660s, Lully evolved the performances into a combination of ballet, singing, and theater. The performance of Moli√®re's comedy-ballet Le Mariage forc√© (\\"The Forced Marriage\\"), at the Louvre on 29 January 1664, included not only scenes by Moli√®re and his actors, but several ballets, and also songs by the leading singers of the day, Mademoiselle Hilaire and Signora Anna. However, in 1670, at the age of twenty-six, Louis XIV decided to give up dancing. As a result, Lully revised the format of the court ballets to please the King as a spectator, rather than dancer. For his new trag√©die-ballet, Psych√©, performed before the King on January 17, 1671, the performance included dancing, singing, acting, orchestral music, and immense visual spectacles created by stage machinery. At one point in the performance, three hundred performers were on or suspended above the stage, singing, dancing, or playing lutes, flutes, trumpets, cymbals, violins, the harpsichord, the hautbois and the th√©orbe. Religious music A Te Deum sung in the choir of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, (engraving by Jean Marot 1653) In the Baroque era, music was an important weapon to win ordinary people to the side of the Catholic Church, as it had been since the Counter-Reformation, a time when music was given a larger role in religious services. The Sainte-Chapelle was renowned for the purity and beauty of its music, while the Te Deum sung at Notre-Dame was reputed for its soloists, choirs, and double-choirs, and for the musical form called the motet created for the cathedral's singers. The churches were equipped with magnificent organs. Most organists of the churches of Paris were members of families who held the post for generations: the most illustrious were members of the Couperin family, who were organists at the church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais, near the Louvre, for over two centuries, from 1650 until the French Revolution. The most outstanding member of the family was Fran√ßois Couperin, who composed and published numerous pieces, both religious and secular, for the organ and harpsichord. The dynasties included several women who made their mark on Parisian music: Fran√ßois' daughter, Louise Couperin, was a celebrated singer, and his granddaughter Marguerite became the first woman harpsichordist attached to the royal orchestra. Elisabeth Blanchet, the daughter of a prominent Paris harpsichord maker and wife of Armand-Louis Couperin, often took the place of her husband at the organs of Saint-Gervais, Sainte-Chapelle and Notre Dame. Her daughter, C√©leste, also became a noted Paris organist at Saint-Gervais.

Etching by G. Wellcome V0007116.jpg|Guillaume de Limoges, the ribald street singer called the \\"Lame Lothario\\" on the Pont Neuf (17th century) The most popular gathering place for street musicians and singers, as well as clowns, acrobats, and poets, was the Pont Neuf, inaugurated by Louis XIII in 1613. All the carriages of the aristocracy and the wealthy crossed the bridge, and since it was the only bridge not lined by houses, there was room for a large audience. Listeners could hear comical songs about current events, romantic poems set to music, and (after 1673), the latest melodies of the court composer, Lully. Philipotte, the \\"Orpheus of the Pont-Neuf\\", Duchemin, \\"The Choir boy of the Pont-Neuf\\", and the one-legged Guillaume de Limoges, the \\"Lame Lothario\\", known for his ribald songs, were famous throughout Paris. The celebrated bateleur Tabarin set up a small stage on Place Dauphine, at the point where the bridge crosses the √éle-de-la-CIt√©; his company presented theater, songs and comedy. Between acts, his business partner sold medicines and ointments. Paris street musician by Georges de la Tour (1630‚Äì36) The debuts of each of the lyric-tragic operas of Lully were followed almost immediately by parodies performed on the stages at the large outdoor fairs of Paris, at Saint-Germain and Saint-Laurent. A large stage was constructed at the Saint-Germain fair in 1678. The Academy of Music moved quickly to have the city ban recitation of text on stage, which was the exclusive right of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise and the Royal Academy of Music. The actors at the fairs responded by writing their dialogue on signs and holding them up, where the audience read them aloud. The singers sometimes also sang with unintelligible words, mimicking the formal court style of Lully's music. The performers at the fairs invented a new style which combined comic songs with satire, and acrobatics, a form which took the name vaudeville. The foundation of the Royal Academy of Music in 1672 created a growing gulf between the official musicians of the court and the popular musicians of Paris, who were members of the guild of m√©n√©triers (minstrels), with its own rules and traditions, under their traditional head, the elected \\"King of the Minstrels\\". While the guild of minstrels had a monopoly over the music in the streets, Lully, the head of the royal academy, had an ordinance passed which gave academy members the exclusive right to play at balls, serenades, and other public events. Academy members did not have to go through the apprenticeship required to be a member of the minstrels guild. The guild of minstrels brought a lawsuit against Fran√ßois Couperin and all organists of the Paris churches, demanding that they join the minstrels guild. The guild won the lawsuit, but the organists appealed to the Parliament of Paris, which exempted them from the rules of the guild. The guild continued to exist until the Revolution: in 1791, it was quietly dissolved. 18th century‚Äîthe opera, the comic opera, and the salons The musical life of Paris at the beginning of the 18th century was gloomy; the court was at Versailles, and frivolity was officially frowned upon by Louis XIV and his second wife, the Marquise de Maintenon, and the religious party at court. The King's favorite composer, Lully, fell into disgrace because of his unorthodox lifestyle. Musical satires and farces continued to be sung on stages at the fairs, but they were constantly under attack from the Royal Academy of Music, which claimed a monopoly on singing performances. The Th√©√¢tre-Italien troupe was forced to leave Paris because of accusations that they made fun of Madame de Maintenon. After the death of the Louis XIV in 1715, the Regent and royal court returned to Paris, and the musical world brightened. The Opera Jean-Philippe Rameau (1728) The opera continued to create lavish productions of lyrical tragedies, in the style of Lully. In 1749, the management of the opera was transferred from the court to Paris, much to the dismay of city authorities, who had to pay for the huge spectacles. The opera performed at the theater of the Palais-Royal until April 6, 1763, when a fire destroyed that venue. It moved to the Hall of Machines of the Tuileries, then back to the Palais-Royal in 1770 when the theater was rebuilt. It burned down again in 1781. After Lully, the lyric-tragedy style of opera was faithfully maintained by a series of composers, the most prominent of whom was Jean-Philippe Rameau, who arrived in Paris from Dijon in 1723 and premiered his first opera, Hippolyte et Aricie, in 1733. The Mercure de France, the first Paris newspaper, described his music as \\"manly, harmonious, and of a new character\\" different from the music of Lully. The musical world of Paris soon divided into Lullyistes and Ramistes (or Rameauneurs, as they were termed by Voltaire). The prolific Rameau produced not only lyrical tragedies, but also opera-ballets, pastorales, and comic ballets. Scene from Le devin du village, the romantic one-act opera by Jean-Jacques Rousseau By the 1750s, Paris audiences were beginning to tire of the formality, conventions, repetitive themes, mechanical tricks and great length of the lyrical tragedies. In the Enlightenment begun in France in 1715, critics demanded a new, more natural form of opera. The battle was launched by the first performance in 1752 of La Serva Patrona, a 1733 Italian opera by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi at the Academy by the company of Bouffons. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau praised the Italian opera for its simple plot, popular characters, and melodic singing. Describing the quarrel in his Confessions, Rousseau wrote: \\"On the one side, the most powerful and influential, were the rich, the nobles, and women, supporting the French style; on the other side, more lively, more proud, and more enthusiastic, were the true connaisseurs, the people of talent, the men of genius\\". Rameau defended his music: \\"Do you not know that music is a physical- mathematical science, and that sound is a physical object, and that the relationships between the different sounds are made by mathematics and geometry?\\" Roussau responded that music was the language of feelings; \\"from the melody comes all the power of music over the human spirit.\\" To illustrate his point, Rousseau wrote a text for a new one-act opera (interm√®de), Le devin du village (\\"The village soothsayer\\"), about the love of two simple peasants, which became part of the Academy repertoire for the next sixty years. Over the course of the 18th century, the heroic style of Lully and Rameau quietly disappeared from Paris stages, replaced by the more natural and more romantic Italian style. Christoph Willibald Gluck Another operatic feud began with the arrival of the German composer Christoph Willibald Gluck in Paris in 1776. He had already written a series of successful Italian operas. In Vienna, he had studied French and had been the music teacher of the young Marie Antoinette. In 1774, he staged the opera Iphig√©nie en Aulide in Paris, which became a huge popular triumph; he followed it with a French version of Orfeo ed Euridice, which he had written in Vienna in 1762, and then Alceste, reviving the classical lyrical tragedy style. The supporters of Italian opera responded by bringing the Italian opera composer Niccolo Piccinni to Paris in 1776. The rival new operas written by Gluck and Piccinni did not please the fickle Parisian audiences, and both composers left Paris in disgust. By the time of the Revolution the repertoire of the Paris opera consisted of five operas by Gluck, and those of Piccinni, Antonio Salieri, Sacchini and Gretry. Rameau and the French classical style had almost disappeared from the repertoire. The fairs and the Op√©ra-Comique \\"The Muse of Comedy brings together poetry, music and dance at the Op√©ra-Comique\\" (engraving from 1730) Throughout the 18th century, the stages of the largest fairs, the Foire Saint-Germain and Foire Saint-Laurent, were the places to see popular entertainment, pantomime and satirical songs. They were only open for a short period of time each year, and were strictly controlled by the rules of the Royal Academy of Music. In 1714‚Äì15, the Academy was short of money, and decided to sell licenses to producers of popular theater. The Com√©diens-Italiens, expelled from Paris under Louis XIV, were invited back to Paris to perform satirical songs and sketches on the stage at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne. In 1726, a new company, the Op√©ra-Comique, made up of performers from the Saint-Germain fair, was formed. It first settled near the fair on rue de Buci, then moved to the dead-end street cul de sac des Quatre-Vents. Some of the most famous popular French singers of the period and the playwright Charles-Simon Favart made their debut there. In 1744, the Op√©ra-Comique was taken over by an ambitious new director, Jean Monnet, who built a new theater at the Saint-Laurent fair, with decorations by the famed artist Fran√ßois Boucher, and an orchestra of eighteen musicians conducted by Jean-Philippe Rameau. In 1762, the two competing comic opera theaters were merged under a royal charter, and were allowed to perform all year long, not just during the fairs. The two groups first performed independently on the stage at the H√¥tel de Bourgone, and engaged the best composers of the time, including Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor and Andr√© Gr√©try. In 1783, they built a brand-new theater, between rues Favart, Marivaux, and the future boulevard des Italiens. The new theater, called Salle Favart, opened on April 28, 1783, in the center of what soon became the city's main theater district. Salons The 8-year old Mozart performs for guests in the salon des Quatre Glaces of the Temple in Paris in 1764. Painting Le th√© √† l'anglaise by Michel Barth√©lemy Ollivier, finished in 1766 Much of the musical activity of the city took place in the salons of the nobility and wealthy Parisians. They sponsored private orchestras, often with a combination of both professional and amateur musicians, commissioned works, and organized concerts of very high quality, often with a mixture of both professional and amateur musicians. Some very wealthy Parisians built small theaters within their homes. In 1764, Louis Fran√ßois, Prince of Conti hosted a reception in his palace where the featured attraction was the ten-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the harpsichord. A musical society was organized by the Marquise de Prie, the mistress of the Duke of Bourbon, which gave concerts of Italian music twice a week at the Louvre. The sixty-odd members who attended paid an annual fee, which went to the musicians. Though private individuals were forbidden to hold concerts without the permission of the Royal Academy of Music, a wealthy Parisian named Monsieur Bouland had a theater within his house on rue Saint-Antoine with a stage for two actors, an orchestra of twenty, and seating for three hundred. The owners of salons invited not only classical musicians, but also popular singers of comic opera from the Paris fairs, such as Pierre Laujon and Charles Coll√©, who became quite wealthy. The Masonic movement became immensely popular among the Parisian upper classes; the first lodge opened in Paris in 1736, and had four famous musicians among its first members. By 1742, there were more than twenty, each with its own musical director. One of the most famous concert societies was the Concert Spirituel, created in 1725, which organized public concerts of religious music in Latin, and later Italian and French, in a salon within the Tuileries Palace provided by the King. Attendees at the concerts included queen Marie Antoinette. The society commissioned works of music by important composers, including Haydn and Mozart, who wrote and performed the Symphony n¬∞ 31, K. 297/300a, known as the \\"Paris Symphony\\", for the Society during his visit to Paris in 1778. In 1763, the society moved to the Hall of Machines, and had an orchestra of fifty-four musicians and vocal ensemble of six sopranos, six tenors, and six basses. Popular music and street singers Theater at the Foire Saint-Germain (1763) The most popular venues for popular music, satire, and comic songs continued to be the stages at the major fairs, where crowds listened to satirical, comical and sentimental songs, though they were only open part of the year. In 1742, the royal government decided that the street singers on the Pont-Neuf were a public nuisance, and were blocking traffic. Only booksellers were allowed to remain, and they had to pay a fee to the royal government. The street and popular musicians migrated across town to the Boulevard du Temple, a wide street with vestiges of the old city walls on one side, and houses on the other. In 1753, the city authorized the construction of caf√©s and theaters, at first made of canvas and wood, along the boulevard; and the boulevard quickly became the center of popular theater of Paris, a position it held until the Second Empire. Public balls Public balls were banned on moral grounds during the last years of the reign of Louis XIV, and were not permitted again until after his death in September 1715. Shortly after, a royal ordinance of 31 December 1715 authorized the first public balls in the city. These were the famous masked balls of the Paris Opera, which took place on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays beginning on St. Martin's Day (November 11) and continuing until Carnival (February‚ÄìMarch). The music of revolutionary Paris (1789‚Äì1800) The Festival of the Supreme Being on the Champ de Mars (June 8, 1794) Patriotic and revolutionary songs gave, as one journal of the period, the Chronique de Paris, wrote, \\"The national color to the Revolution\\". They were sung at political meetings, in theaters, in schools and on the streets. The most popular were the Carmagnole (about 1792); with words by an anonymous author, and music from an existing song; and √áa ira with words by Ladr√© and the music of an old contredanse by the violinist B√©caut called Le Carillon national. The song took its title from an expression, \\"That will happen,\\" which Benjamin Franklin, the American envoy to Paris, had popularized, describing the American Revolution. The most famous song of the period was the Chant de guerre pour l'arm√©e du Rhin (Battle Song of the Army of the Rhine), by a young army officer, Claude Rouget de Lisle. It was first sung in public on 30 July 1791 by a battalion of volunteers from Marseille as they marched into Paris, and thereafter became known as the Hymne des Marseillais, which became, on 10 August 1792, the official anthem of the Revolution. During the revolutionary period, √áa ira was played by the orchestra in every theater before a performance, with the audience and performers singing. The Marseillaise was always performed at the intermission. Often the songs were sung during the performances, if the audience demanded it. In 1796, the Directory made the singing of such songs obligatory for all theaters, while banning the singing of songs by other political factions, such as the R√©veil du people (Wake-up call of the People), the song of the Thermidorians. Music was also an important ingredient of the enormous public festivals that were organized by the Revolutionary governments, usually on the Champ de Mars, which was transformed into an immense outdoor theater to host these spectacles. The first was the F√™te de la F√©d√©ration on 14 July 1790, a festival marking the first anniversary of the taking of the Bastille. The f√™tes began in the morning with the ringing of church bells and firing of cannons; patriotic songs were sung throughout the ceremonies, which always concluded with a concert by the musicians of the National Guard and a ball in the streets. The last of the great festivals was the Festival of the Supreme Being, organized on June 8, 1794 by Robespierre, as a substitute for traditional religious celebrations; it had singers and choirs surrounding an artificial mountain crowned by the Tree of Liberty. Robespierre's role in the event did not entirely please the audience; he was arrested and executed a few weeks later. Founding of the Conservatory The flight of the aristocracy from Paris had created an enormous number of unemployed musicians and music teachers. However, the growing number of public concerts and ceremonies required a great number of trained musicians, particularly for the orchestra and band of the Garde Nationale, which had been formed in June 1790 to perform at the Festival of the Federation on the Champ de Mars. Bernard Sarrette, a captain of the National Guard, founded a school to train eighty young musicians, who at first were taught only wind instruments. The first national music school in France, it was given the name the Institut national de Musique. The teachers were leading musicians and composers of the period. The revolutionary Committee of Public Safety (Comit√© de salut public) instructed the new music school to concentrate on the composition of \\"civic songs, music for national festivals, theater pieces, military music, all types of music which will inspire in Republicans the sentiments and memories most dear to the Revolution.\\" In 1792, the revolutionary government, the National Convention, decided to create a larger and more ambitious school of music, which would teach all instruments and genres of music. It was named the Conservatoire national de musique, using the name \\"Conservatory\\", an Italian Renaissance institution much praised by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It became the first music conservatory in France, with 350 students of both sexes from the 83 departments of France of that time. The 115 music teachers were paid by the State. The institute, in the meanwhile, collected the musical instruments and musical libraries of the thousands of aristocrats who had fled France, and stored them in a central depository for the use of students. The Conservatory opened its doors in 1796. Musical theater and the opera The first Salle Favart, built for the Th√©√°tre Royal Italien in 1783 Despite the turmoil of the Revolution (or perhaps partly because of it) musical theater thrived during the period. New theaters appeared: the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville, the Palais- Vari√©tes and the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau. The Feydau theater featured both a troupe performing French comic operas, and another performing Italian comedies. A half-dozen new theaters on the Boulevard du Temple, the new theater district of the city, performed vaudeville, pantomime and comic opera. The actress Mademoiselle Montansier opened her own musical theater in the Palais-Royal. The great fair of Saint-Germain, was closed by the Revolution, but a new theater, the Th√©√¢tre Lyrique de Saint-Germain, opened on its old site in 1791. Seventy-six new comic operas or vaudeville programs were staged in 1790, and fifty new works in each of the following years. Censorship of theatrical works was abolished in 1791, but this freedom did not last long. In 1793, the Committee of Public Safety decreed that any theater which put on plays \\"contrary to the spirit of the Revolution\\" would be closed and its property seized. After this decree, musical works on patriotic and revolutionary themes multiplied in the Paris theaters. The opera itself, a symbol of the aristocracy, was officially taken away from the former Royal Academy and given to the city of Paris in 1790. When the Terror began in 1793, one of its two new directors fled abroad, and the second was arrested, and only escaped the guillotine because Robespierre was executed first. Price of tickets was reduced, and special free performances were given for the poor. The program at both the Opera and the Op√©ra-comique were largely patriotic, republican and sometimes anti-religious. At the same time, operas by Lully and Gluck were still performed, though sometimes new lyrics were added attacking the King and monarchy. In March 1793, in the midst of the terror, Parisians heard their first Mozart opera, The Magic Flute, in French and without the recitatives. The opera was forced to move from its theater at Porte Saint-Martin in 1794 to the Salle Montansier at the Palais-Royal so the government could use the theater for political meetings. The Opera saw its name changed from the Acad√©mie royale de musique to the Th√©√°tre de l'Op√©ra (1791), Th√©√°tre des Arts (1791), Th√©√°tre de la R√©publique et des Arts (1797), Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra again in 1802, then, under Napoleon, to the Acad√©mie imp√©riale (1804). Pleasure gardens, caf√©s chantants and guinguettes The Caf√© des Aveugles at the Palais-Royal in about 1800 During the late 18th century, and particularly after the end of the Reign of Terror, Parisians of all classes were in constant search for entertainment. The end of the century saw the opening of the pleasure gardens of Ranelegh, Vauxhall, and Tivoli. These were large private gardens where, in summer, Parisians paid an admission charge and found food, music, dancing, and other amusements, from pantomime to magic lantern shows and fireworks. The admission fee was relatively high; the owners of the gardens wanted to attract a more upper-class clientele and keep out the more boisterous Parisians who thronged the boulevards. With the closure of the fairs by the 1789 Revolution, the most popular destination for musical entertainment became Palais-Royal. Between 1780 and 1784, the duc de Chartres, (who became the Duke of Orleans in 1785 at the death of his father), rebuilt the garden of the Palais-Royal into a pleasure garden surrounded by wide covered arcades, which were occupied by shops, art galleries, and the first true restaurants in Paris. The basements were occupied by popular caf√©s with drinks, food and musical entertainment, and the upper floors by rooms for card-playing. The first famous musical caf√© was the Caf√© des Aveugles, which had an orchestra and chorus of blind musicians. In its early days it was popular with visitors to Paris, and also attracted prostitutes, trinket- sellers and pickpockets. Later caf√©s in the Palais Royal, named caf√©s chantants, offered musical programs of comic, sentimental and patriotic songs. The guinguette was mentioned as early as 1723 in Savary's posthumously published Dictionnaire du commerce. It was a type of tavern located just outside the city limits, where wine and other drinks were much cheaper and taxed less. They were open Sundays and holidays, usually had musicians for dancing, and attracted large crowds of working-class Parisians eager for rest and recreation after the work week. As time went on, guinguettes also attracted middle class Parisians with their families. Music during the First Empire (1800-1814) The contralto Giuseppina Grassini was a favorite of Napoleon During the reign of Napol√©on Bonaparte as First Consul and then Emperor, music in Paris was used to celebrate his victories and glory. Napoleon installed his brother Lucien as chief censor in 1800, and all musical and theater works were examined by the police before being performed. The former Academy of Music became the Acad√©mie imp√©riale de musique. The official composer of Napoleon's regime was Jean-Fran√ßois Lesueur, who wrote a heroic opera, Ossian, ou Les bardes to glorify Napoleon. It was performed more than a hundred times in Paris before Napoleon's fall. Lesueur also wrote a special march for the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor at Notre-Dame, and directed the solemn mass, Te Deum and other music performed at the coronation. Lesueur wrote new opera Le Triomphe de Trajan, to celebrate Napoleon's victories at Jena, Friedland and Eylau. The opera had spectacular staging, with parades of soldiers and cavalry on stage. Lesueur continued his musical career after Napoleon's fall, as a professor of composition at the Conservatory; his future students included Hector Berlioz and Charles Gounod.Herbermann, Charles, ed. (1913), Jean-Fran√ßois Lesueur, Catholic Encyclopedia, New York: Robert Appleton. The Empress Jos√©phine had her own favorite composer, the Italian Gaspare Spontini, who became her official composer of both historical dramas and comedies. Spontini's first lyrical work, La vestale, had a considerable success. His next work, Fernand Cortez, was commissioned when Napoleon decided to invade Spain, and celebrated the conquest of Mexico by Hern√°n Cort√©s. Unfortunately, the French army was defeated in Spain and Fernand Cortez was pulled from the repertoire, but it made a great impression on other French composers with its grand scenic effects, a Mexican ballet and a cavalry charge, its use of drums, and its huge chorus. Napoleon recreated the grandeur of the earlier royal court, constructing a new theater at the Tuileries Palace, which was finished in 1808. He also brought together an exceptional troupe of musicians and singers from Italy, including the composer Ferdinando Pa√´r, who became master of his household music, the castrato Girolamo Crescentini, and the contralto Giuseppina Grassini. Napoleon did not allow applause in the hall during performances. The orchestra played a special air by Andr√© Gr√©try when Napoleon entered the theater, and the Vivat Imperator when he departed. But, because of his military campaigns, he was rarely in Paris to enjoy them. Napoleon gave eight theaters official status and, to avoid competition to his official theaters, he closed all the others. The Imperial Academy and the Op√©ra-Comique were at the top of the hierarchy; followed by the Th√©√¢tre de lEmpereur, the new Opera buffa of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Imp√©ratrice, the theater of the Empress, run by Mademoiselle Montansier. Major operas and melodramas were performed at the theater at Porte-Saint- Martin and Op√©ra-Comique; parodies at the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville, and rustic comedies at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. With the signing of the Concordat in 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, the churches of Paris were re-opened, and religious music was allowed once more. Music during the Restoration (1815‚Äì1830) The Opera and the Conservatory Salle Montansier on the rue de Richelieu, home of the Paris opera, about 1820 After Napoleon's second abdication at the end of the Hundred Days in 1815, and his exile to the island of Saint Helena, the new government of Louis XVIII tried to restore the Parisian musical world to what it had been before the Revolution. The opera once again became the Royal Academy; the Conservatory, renamed the √âcole royale de musique, was given a new department of religious music; and the composer Luigi Cherubini was commissioned to write a coronation solemn mass, the \\"Mass in G major\\", for Louis XVIII, and in 1825, the \\"Mass in A major\\" for his successor, Charles X. Spontini was named director of royal music. Lavish concerts in salons resumed in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, often given with the most popular new keyboard instrument, the piano. However, the government greatly irritated ordinary Parisians by banning music and dancing on Sundays, closing the popular guinguettes. At the beginning of the Restoration, the Paris Opera was located in the Salle Montansier on rue de Richelieu, where the square Louvois is today. On 13 February 1820, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry was assassinated at the door of the opera, and King Louis XVIII, in his grief, had the old theater demolished. In 1820‚Äì1821, the opera performed in the Salle Favart of the Th√©√¢tre des Italiens, then in the salle Louvois on rue Louvois, and, beginning on 16 August 1821, in the new opera house on rue Le Peletier, which was built out of the material of the old opera house. It was intended to be a temporary home until a new opera house was built; it was neither elegant nor well-located, but it was large and had modern lighting and stage equipment, with gas lights installed in 1822, and the first electrical lighting in 1849. It remained the primary opera venue of Paris for a half century, until the opening of the Palais Garnier. The opera repertoire was largely familiar works of Gluck, Sacchini and Spontini, to which were added fresh works by new composers, such as Fran√ßois Adrien Boieldieu, Louis Joseph Ferdinand H√©rold, and Daniel Auber. An opera by Carl Maria von Weber, Der Freisch√ºtz, was translated into French under the title Robin des Bois (\\"Robin Hood\\"), and presented in 1824, causing a sensation. The first of new genre of romantic and nationalist French operas, La Muette de Portici by Auber, premiered in February 1829; the hero was an Italian patriot fighting against Spanish occupation and oppression. A performance of the same opera in Brussels in 1830 led to a popular uprising and the liberation of Belgium from Dutch rule. The opera also featured grand spectacles created with ingenious stage machinery and lighting, including recreations of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the realistic illusions of flames and moving water. Rossini and the Th√©√¢tre Italien Set for the opera Le Si√®ge de Corinthe by Rossini (1827) The grand rival of the royal opera was the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, which beginning in 1819 performed at the Salle Favart. It was formally under the administration of the royal opera, but it had its own administrator and repertoire and produced only works in Italian. It presented the works of the composer Gioacchino Rossini, who staged his first work in the Paris, L'italiana in Algeri in 1817, followed by a series of successes. Rossini presented his most famous work, The Barber of Seville, in 1818, two years after it premiered in Rome. Rossini made modifications for the French audience, changing it from two to four acts and changing Rosina's part from a contralto to a soprano. This new version premiered at the Od√©on-Th√©√¢tre on 6 May 1824, with Rossini present, and remains today the version most used in opera houses around the world. Rossini decided to settle in Paris and became the musical director of the theater. With Rossini at its head, the Th√©√¢tre- Italien had a huge success; its company included several of the finest singers in Europe, including Giulia Grisi, the niece of Napoleon's favorite, Giuseppina Grassi; and Maria Malibran, who became the most famous interpreters of the music of Rossini. After a fire burned the Salle Favart in 1838, the troupe had several homes before it finally settled in the Salle Ventadour in 1841. Rossini continued to produce lavish operas with spectacular sets, rapid pace, the use of unusual instruments (the trombone, cymbals and triangle) and extravagant emotion. He staged Siege of Corinth (1827), followed by Moses and the comic opera Le comte Ory. He then undertook to write an opera that was entirely French; he wrote William Tell based on a play by Schiller, which premiered at the Salle Le Peletier on August 3, 1829. Though the famous overture was a success, the public reception for the rest of the opera was cool; the work was criticized for excessive length (four hours), a weak story, and a lack of action. Rossini, deeply wounded by the criticism, retired, at the age of thirty-seven, and never wrote another opera. Popular music‚Äîthe Goguette and the political song The goguette called Les joyeux in a caf√© in 1844 The musical salons of the aristocracy were imitated by a new institution; the goguette, musical clubs formed by Paris workers, craftsmen, and employees. There were goguettes of both men and women. They usually met once a week, often in the back room of a cabaret, where they would enthusiastically sing popular, comic, and sentimental songs. During the Restoration, songs were also an important form of political expression. The poet and songwriter Pierre Jean de B√©ranger became famous for his songs ridiculing the aristocracy, the established church and the ultra-conservative parliament. He was imprisoned twice for his songs, in 1821 and 1828, which only added to his fame. His supporters around France sent foie gras, fine cheeses and wines to him in prison. The celebrated Paris police chief Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq sent his men to infiltrate the goguettes and arrest those who sang songs ridiculing the monarch. Music in Paris under Louis Philippe (1830-1848) Fr√©d√©ric Chopin by Maria Wodzi≈Ñska (1836) Public resentment against the Restoration government boiled over in July 1830 with an uprising in the streets of Paris, the departure of King Charles X, and the installation of the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Music played its part in the 1830 Revolution; the famed tenor Adolphe Nourrit, who had starred in the operas of Rossini, went onto the stages of Paris and emotionally sang the Marseillaise, which had been forbidden during the First Empire and the Restoration. As Europe was upset by revolutions and repression, many of the finest musicians in the continent came to seek sanctuary in Paris. The most famous was Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, who arrived in Paris in September 1831 at the age of twenty-one, and did not return to Congress Poland because of the crushing of the Polish uprising against Russian rule in October 1831. Chopin gave his first concert in Paris at the Salle Pleyel on 26 February 1832, and remained in the city for most of the next eighteen years. He gave just thirty public performances during these years, preferring to give recitals in private salons. On 16 February 1838 and on 2 December 1841,Selected Correspondence of Fryderyk Chopin, collected & annotated by Bronislaw Edward Sydow, translated by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc. New York, 1963, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 62-1770327815, p. 214 he played at the Tuileries for King Louis-Philippe and the royal family. (He also gave a recital for the royal family in October 1839 in the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud). He earned his living from commissions given by wealthy patrons, including the wife of James Mayer de Rothschild, from publishing his compositions and giving private lessons. Chopin lived at different addresses in Paris: upon his arrival in September 1831 until 1836, at 27 boulevard Poissonni√®re, then at 38 rue de la Chauss√©e-d'Antin, and 5 rue Tronchet. He had a ten-year relationship with the writer George Sand between 1837 and 1847. In 1842, they moved together to the Square d'Orl√©ans, at 80 rue Taitbout, where the relationship ended. His last address in Paris was 12 Place Vend√¥me, where he moved in the second half of September 1849.Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's letter to Auguste Franchomme, dated 17 September 1849, in Selected Correspondence of Fryderyk Chopin, collected & annotated by Bronislaw Edward Sydow, translated by Arthur Hedley, McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc. New York, 1963, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 62-1770327815, p. 372 Hector Berlioz, by √âmile Signol (1832) Franz Liszt also lived in Paris during this period, composing music for the piano and giving concerts and music lessons. He lived at the H√¥tel de France on rue La Fayette, not far from Chopin. The two men were friends, but Chopin did not appreciate the manner in which Liszt played variations on his music. Liszt wrote in 1837 in La Revue et Gazette musicale: \\"Paris is the pantheon of living musicians, the temple where one becomes a god for a century or for an hour; the burning fire which lights and then consumes all fame.\\" The violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini was a frequent visitor and performer in Paris. In 1836, he made an unfortunate investment in a Paris casino, and went bankrupt. He was forced to sell his collection of violins to pay his debts. Richard Wagner came to Paris in 1839, hoping to present his works on the Paris opera stages, with no success. Some interest was finally shown by the director of the Paris Opera; he rejected Wagner's music but wanted to buy the synopsis of his opera, Le Vaissau fant√¥me, to be put to music by a French composer, Louis-Philippe Dietsch. Wagner sold the work for five hundred francs, and returned home in 1842. The French composer Hector Berlioz had come to Paris from Grenoble in 1821 to study medicine, which he abandoned for music in 1824, attending the Conservatory in 1826, and won the Prix de Rome for his compositions in 1830. He was working on his most famous work, the Symphonie Fantastique, at the time of the July 1830 revolution. It had its premiere on 4 December 1830. The Royal Academy, Op√©ra-Comique and Th√©√¢tre-Italien Trio from Robert le Diable by Giacomo Meyerbeer (1835) Three Paris theaters were permitted to produce operas; The Royal Academy of Music on rue Le Peletier; the Op√©ra-Comique, and the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, nicknamed \\"Les Bouffes\\". The Royal Academy, financed by the government, was in dire financial difficulties. In February, the government handed over management of the theater to a gifted entrepreneur, Doctor V√©ron, who had become wealthy selling medicinal ointments. V√©ron targeted the audience of the newly-wealthy Parisian businessmen and entrepreneurs; he redesigned the theater to make the loges smaller (six seats reduced to four seats), installed gas lights to improve visibility, and launched a new repertoire to make the Paris Opera \\"both brilliant and popular\\". The first great success of the new regime was Robert le Diable by the German composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, which premiered on November 21, 1831. The opera combined the German orchestral style with the Italian lyric singing style; it was an immense critical and popular success. Meyerbeer wrote a succession of popular operas, including At the end of his four-year contact, Doctor V√©ron retired, leaving the Opera in an admirable financial and artistic position. Set for Act 1 of La Juive at the Op√©ra-Comique (1835) The Op√©ra-Comique also enjoyed great success, largely due to the talents of the scenarist Eug√®ne Scribe, who wrote ninety works for the theater, put to music by forty different composers, including Daniel Auber, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Fromental Hal√©vy (La Juive (1835)), Cherubini, Donizetti, Gounod and Verdi (for whom he wrote Les v√™pres siciliennes). Scribe left behind the grand mythological themes of earlier French opera, and wrote stories from a variety of historical periods which, with a mixture of strong emotion, humor and romanticism, exactly suited the taste of Parisian audiences. Premiere of Donizetti's Don Pasquale in 1843 by the Th√©√¢tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour The Th√©√¢tre-Italien completed the grand trio of Paris opera houses. After the fire at the Salle Favart, it moved briefly to the Od√©on Theater and then permanently to the Salle Ventadour. In their repertoire, the ballet played a very small part, part, the costumes and sets were not remarkable, and the number of works was small; only a dozen new operas were staged between 1825 and 1870; but they included several famous works of Bel Canto opera, including I Puritani by Bellini and Marino Faliero and Don Pasquale by Donizetti. Verdi lived primarily in Paris between 1845 and 1847, and staged four of his operas at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien; Nabucco, Ernani, I due Foscari, and J√©rusalem. The leading Italian singers also came regularly to sing at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, including Giovanni Rubini, the creator of the role of Arturo in Bellini's I Puritani, Giulia Grisi, Fanny Persiani, Henriette Sontag and Giuditta Pasta, who created the role of Norma in Bellini's opera. French composers including Hector Berlioz struggled in vain against the tide of Italian operas. Berlioz succeeded in getting his opera Benvenuto Cellini staged at the Royal Academy in 1838, but it closed after just three performances, and was not staged again in France during his lifetime. Berlioz complained in the Journal des Debats that there were six operas by Donizetti in Paris playing in one year. \\"Monsieur Donizetti has the air to treat us like a conquered country,\\" he wrote, \\"it is a veritable war of invasion. We can no longer call them the lyric theaters of Paris, just the lyric theaters of Monsieur Donizetti.\\" The Conservatory and the symphony orchestra A concert at the Salle of the Paris Conservatory (March 1843) With the growing popularity of classical music and the arrival of so many talented musicians, Paris encountered a shortage of concert halls. The best hall in the city was that of the Paris Conservatory on rue Berg√©re, which had excellent acoustics and could seat a thousand persons. Berlioz premiered his Symphonie Fantastique there on December 30, 1830; on December 29, 1832, Berlioz presented the Symphony again, along with two new pieces, Lelio and Harold en Italie, which he wrote specially for Paganini to play. At the end of the performance, with Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas in the audience, Paganini bowed down humbly before Berlioz. in tribute. The Concert Society of the Paris Conservatory was founded in 1828, especially to play the symphonies of Beethoven; one at each performance, along with works by Mozart, Hayden and Handel. It was the first professional symphonic association in Europe. A second symphony association, the Societ√© de Sainte-Cecile, was founded shortly afterwards, which played more modern music; it presented the Paris premieres of Wagner's Tannhauser overture, works by Schubert, the Symphonie Italienne of Mendelssohn, the Fuite en √âgypte of Berlioz, and the first works of Charles Gounod and Georges Bizet. Birth of the romantic ballet Marie Taglioni in La Sylphide (1832) The ballet had been an integral part of the Paris Opera since the time of Louis XIV the 17th century. A new style, Romantic ballet, was born on March 12, 1832 with the premiere of La Sylphide at the Salle Le Peletier, with choreography by Filippo Taglioni and music by Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer. Taglioni designed the work as a showcase for his daughter Marie. La Sylphide was the first ballet where dancing en pointe had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt. Other romantic ballets that had their first performances at the Opera were Giselle (1841), Paquita (1846) and Le corsaire (1856) Among the great ballerinas to grace the stage of the Op√©ra during this time were Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Carolina Rosati, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito. Lucien Petipa danced the male lead in Giselle at its premiere, and his younger brother Marius Petipa also danced for a time at the Paris Opera. Marius Petipa moved from Paris to Saint Petersburg, where he became the ballet-master for the Russian Imperial ballet and created many celebrated ballets, including The Sleeping Beauty, La Bayad√®re and The Nutcracker. Balls, Concerts-Promenades and the romance The Champs-√âlys√©es was redeveloped in the 1830s with public gardens at either end, and became a popular place for Parisians to promenade. It was soon lined with restaurants, cafes-chantants. and pleasure gardens where outdoor concerts and balls were held. The Caf√© Turc opened a garden with a series of concert-promenades in the spring of 1833, which alternated symphonic music with quadrilles and airs for dancing. The 17-year-old jacques Offenbach wrote his first compositions for the dance orchestra at the Caf√© Turc. The Tivoli, the Bazar of rue Saint-Honor√© and the Casino Paganini competed with the Caf√© Turc. In 1837, the King of the Viennese waltz, Johann Strauss, came in person to in Paris, competing with the French waltz king, Philippe Musard. The outdoor concerts and balls did not stay in fashion for long; most of the gardens began to close after 1838, and Musard took charge instead of the famous masked balls at the Paris Opera. The romance, a song with a simple, tender melody, sentimental words, accompanied on the piano, became the fashion in the Paris salons. Thousands of copies were sold by Paris publishers. The piano and the saxophone The July monarchy saw a surge in sales of instruments, especially pianos, for the French upper and middle class. Production of pianos in Paris tripled between 1830 and 1847, from four thousand to eleven thousand a year. The companies organized concerts and sponsored famous musicians to promote their brands. Chopin was contracted to play exclusively the Pleyel piano, while Liszt played on the √ârard piano. The Paris firms of Pleyel, √ârard, Herz, Pape and Kriegelstein exported pianos around the world. The crafts of other instruments also flourished; the Parisian firm of Cavaill√©-Coll reconstructed the great organs of Notre-Dame, Saint-Sulpice, and the Basilica of Saint-Denis, which had been destroyed during the French Revolution. In 1842 the Belgian Adolphe Sax, 28-years old, arrived in Paris with his new invention, the saxophone. He won a silver medal for his new instrument at the Paris Exposition of French Industry in 1844, and in April 1845 won a competition held by the French Army on the Champs-de-Mars, in which a fanfare was played on traditional instruments and then on the instruments of Adolphe Sax. The jury chose the instrument of Sax, and it was adapted by the French Army, and then by orchestras and ensembles throughout the world. Popular music‚Äîstreet musicians and goguettes At the beginning of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 saltimbanques, 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers. The goguettes , or working class singing-clubs, continued to grow in the popularity, meeting in the back rooms of cabarets. The repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially in the 1840s. in June, 1848, the musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the 1848 French Revolution. The 1848 Revolution and the Second Republic following the 1848 Revolution and the abdication of Louis-Philippe, the censorship of Paris theaters was briefly abolished. The Opera was renamed the Th√©√¢tre de la Nation, then Op√©ra-Th√©√¢tre de la Nation, then Acad√©mie nationale de musique. A new musical theater, the Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique, was created, devoted to presenting the works of young French composers, who had been largely ignored during the July monarchy. It was located on the Boulevard du Temple, the new theater district, in a building which had previously been occupied by the theater founded by Alexander Dumas to present historical plays. The caf√©s chantants became increasingly popular, spreading from the Champs √âlys√©es to the Grand boulevards. Some, like the Caf√© des Ambassadeurs, had outdoor concert gardens lit by gaslights. They presented romances by popular singers, and also a new comic genre, the minstrel show, featuring French singers with blackened faces playing the banjo and violin. The famous music caf√©s included the Moka on rue de la Lune, the Folies and Eldorado on boulevard Strasbourg, and the Alcazar on rue de Faubourg-Poissonni√©re, The Second Empire The Imperial Opera‚ÄîVerdi and Wagner The Grand salle of the Royal Academy of Music on rue Le Peletier, home of the Paris Opera before the completion of the Palais Garnier in 1875 During the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (1852‚Äì1870), the top of the hierarchy of Paris theaters was the Acad√©mie Imperial, or Imperial Opera Theatre, in the Salle Peletier. The opera house on Rue le Peletier could seat 1800 spectators. There were three performances a week, scheduled so as not to compete with the other major opera house in the city, Les Italiens. The best seats were in the forty boxes, which could each hold four or six persons, on the first balcony. One of the boxes could be rented for the entire season for 7500 francs. One of the major functions of the opera house was to be a meeting place for Paris society, and for this reason the performances were generally very long, with as many as five intermissions. Ballets were generally added in the middle of operas, to create additional opportunities for intermissions. The Salle Peletier had one infamous moment in its history; on 14 January 1858, a group of Italian extreme nationalists attempted to kill Napoleon III at the entrance of the opera house; they set off several bombs, which killed eight people and injured one hundred and fifty persons, and splattered the Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo with blood, though the Emperor was unharmed.Maneglier, Herv√©, Paris Imp√©rial, p. 188. Giuseppe Verdi played an important part in the glory of the Paris opera. He had first performed Nabucco in Paris in 1845 at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, followed by Luisa Miller and Il trovatore He signed a new contract with the Paris Opera in 1852, and wanted absolute perfection for his next Parisian project, Les V√™pres siciliennes He complained that the Paris orchestra and chorus were unruly and undisciplined, and rehearsed them an unheard-of one hundred an sixty-one times before he felt they were ready. His work was rewarded; the opera was a critical and popular success, performed 150 times, rather than the originally proposed forty performances. He was unhappy, however, that his operas were less successful in Paris than those of his chief rival, Meyerbeer; he returned to Italy and did not come back for several years. He was persuaded to return to stage Don Carlos, commissioned especially for the Paris Opera. Once again he ran into troubles; one singer took him to court over the casting, and rivalries between other singers poisoned the production. He wrote afterwards, \\"I am not a composer for Paris I believe in inspiration; others only care about how the pieces are put together\\".Cited in Vila (2007), pages 187-190 Napoleon III intervened personally to have Richard Wagner come back to Paris; Wagner rehearsed the orchestra sixty-three times for the first French production of Tannh√§user on March 13, 1861. Unfortunately, Wagner was unpopular with both the French critics and with the members of the Jockey Club, an influential French social society. During the premiere, with Wagner in the audience, the Jockey Club members whistled and jeered from the first notes of the Overture. After just three performances, the Opera was pulled from the repertoire. Wagner got his revenge in 1870, when the Prussian Army captured Napoleon III and surrounded Paris; he wrote a special piece of music to celebrate the event, Ode to the German Army at Paris. Napoleon III wanted a new opera house to be the centerpiece connecting the new boulevards he was constructing on the right bank. The competition was won by Charles Garnier and the first stone was laid by the Emperor in July 1862, but flooding of the basement caused the construction to proceed very slowly. As the building rose, it was covered with a large shed so the sculptors and artists could create the elaborate exterior decoration. The shed was taken off on August 15, 1867, in time for the Paris Universal Exposition, so visitors and Parisians could see the glorious new building; but the inside was not finished until 1875, after Napoleon's fall. Herv√©, Offenbach and the Op√©ra Bouffes Hortense Schneider as la Grande- Duchesse de G√©rolstein The operetta was born in Paris with the work of Louis Auguste Florimond Ronger, better known under the name of Herv√©. His first operetta was called Don Quilchotte et Sancho Panza, performed in 1848 at the th√©√¢tre Montmartre. In the beginning they were short comic works or parodies, with a combination of songs, dance and dialogue, rarely with more than two persons on stage, and rarely longer than one act. Early operettas by Herv√© was named Latrouillat and Truffaldini or the Inconvenience of a vendetta infinitely too prolonged and Agammemnon or the Camel with Two humps. Herv√© opened a new theater, the Folies-Concertantes, on the Boulevard du Temple in 1854, later renamed the Folies-Nouvelle. The new genre was termed Opera Bouffe; works by Herv√© appeared at a half-dozen theaters in the city, though the genre was ignored by the opera and the other official theaters. In 1853, the young German-born musician and composer Jacques Offenbach, then director of the orchestra of the Comedie-Fran√ßaise, wrote his first operetta in the new style, Pepita for the Th√©atre des Varietes. It was a success, but Offenbach was still unable to perform his works in the official theaters. During the first Paris Universal Exposition, he opened his own theater, the Bouffes- Parisiens, in an old theater at the Carr√© Marigny on the Champs-√âlys√©es. It was an immense success; Rossini termed Offenbach \\"The Mozart of the Champs- √âlys√©es\\". Offenbach moved to a larger theatre on the passage Choiseul, and presented his next operetta, Ba-ta-clan, which also enjoyed spectacular success. In 1858 Offenbach wrote a more serious and ambitious work, Orph√©e aux enfers, a four-act opera with a large cast and chorus. It was also a popular and critical success; Emperor Napoleon III attended, and afterwards presented Offenbach with French citizenship. With the approval of the Emperor, the official theaters of Paris were finally open to Offenbach, and his works became popular with the upper classes. He achieved further success with La Belle H√©l√®ne with Hortense Schneider in the leading role; then, again with Schneider, in La Vie parisienne ad la Grande-Duchesse de G√©rolstein In 1867, five different Paris theaters were staging works by Offenbach. He was the champion of the Paris operetta, but he also had the ambition to be considered a serious composer of orchestral works; ,unfortunately he died before the successful premiere of his most ambitious orchestral work, the Contes d'Hoffmann. The Th√©√¢tre Italien, the Th√©√¢tre-Lyrique, and the Opera- Comique Huebner 2003, p. 303. Bizet, Saint-Sa√´ns and Debussy  Georges Bizet (1875) The outbreak of the war between France and Germany in 1870 caused a group of French composers to form the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, (SNM), officially founded on February 25, 1871, to promote new French music and resist the current of German music and particularly the influence of Wagner. It was led by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns and included C√©sar Franck and Jules Massenet. The Society held its first concert at the Salle Pleyel in the autumn of 1871. The SNM played an important part through the Belle √âpoque by introducing Paris audiences to the music of new French composers, including Debussy, Gabriel Faur√©, and Maurice Ravel. In addition to the SNM, Paris had three world-class symphony orchestras during the Belle √âpoque. In 1873 the Concert National was founded, under the direction of √âdouard Colonne. It performed regularly at the Th√©atre du Ch√¢telet, and premiered works by Debussy, Franck, Charles Gounod, Faur√©, Massenet, and Sant-Sa√´ns. Colonne invited leading European composers, including Richard Strauss, Edvard Grieg, and Piotr Tchaikovsky to conduct their works in Paris. He was also the first conductor of note to make commercial gramophone (phonograph) records, for the Path√© company in 1906.Foreman L. √âdouard Colonne - review of Tahra and Symposium CDs. Classic Record Collector, Autumn 2006, p80-81. A second orchestra, the Societ√© des nouveaux concerts, was founded by Charles Lamoureux in 1881, devoted largely to the work of Wagner and his followers. This orchestra performed the Paris premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin at the Eden Theater in 1887. The society became known as the Lamouroux orchestra. A third symphony was created in 1905 by Victor Charpantier, brother of composer Gustave Charpentier, composed of amateur musicians, which gave free concerts at the Trocadero, under the direction of composers including Charpentier, Faur√© and Saint-Sa√´ns. In 1901, Gustave Charpentier founded the first trade union of professional musicians in France. Some of the SNM musicians felt that organization was too conservative, and in 1910 they founded the Societ√© musicale ind√©pendente, or SMI, to promote \\"new tendencies\\" and music from abroad. Gabriel Faur√© became head of the new organization; the SMI would go on to premiere his new works, as well as works by Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and Vaughan Williams, and the first performances of works by Eric Satie before a large public. Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (about 1880) In July 1872 the Op√©ra-Comique commissioned Georges Bizet to write an opera based on the novel Carmen by Prosper M√©rim√©e. The rehearsals for the finished opera were extremely difficult; in previous operas, the chorus simply lined up on stage and sang, but in Carmen, they were asked to walk around the stage, act, and even smoke cigarettes. It defied all conventions of comic opera, with its musical style, the profession of its heroine and its tragic ending. At its premiere on March 3, 1875, it scandalized both the critics and the audience; one critic reported it \\"was neither scenic nor dramatic.\\" It was defended by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, who called it a masterpiece, but when Bizet died three months after the premiere, it was considered a failure. With time it became one of the most- performed works of Paris opera. Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (1835-1921) was born in Paris and was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire when he was thirteen. When he finished the Conservatory, he became an organist at the church of Saint- Merri, and later at La Madeleine. His opera, Samson et Dalila (1877), was in the grand romantic tradition, though the music was new and innovative. He also won fame in Paris for Danse Macabre, the opera The Carnival of the Animals (1877), and his Symphonie No. 3 \\"avec orgue\\" in C minor, op. 78 (1886). Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, Claude Debussy (1908) Claude Debussy (1862-1918) was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, and entered the Conservatory in 1872. He became part of the Parisian literary circle of the symbolist poet St√©phane Mallarm√©, and an admirer of Richard Wagner, then went on to experiment with impressionism in music, atonal music and chromaticism. His most famous works included Clair de Lune (1890), La Mer (1905) and the opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1903-1905). He lived at 23 square de l'Avenue-Foch in the 16th arrondissement from 1905 until his death in 1918. Other influential composers in Paris during the period included Jules Massenet (1842-1912), author of the operas Manon and Werther; Gustave Charpentier, composer of the working-class \\"opera-novel\\" Louise; and Erik Satie (1866-1925), who, after leaving the Conservatory, made his living as a pianist at Le Chat Noir, a cabaret on Montmartre. His most famous works were the Gymnop√©dies (1888). Spanish music had an important part in the music of Paris in the Belle √âpoque, particularly between 1907 and 1914. The prominent Spanish composers Enrique Granados, Isaac Albeniz, Joaqu√≠n Turina and Manuel de Falla all lived in Paris, were inspired by the new works French music as well as traditional Spanish themes, and created a new school of modern Spanish music. They also in turn influenced French music; Debussy and Ravel wrote Iberia and Rapsodie espagnole inspired by Spanish themes. Music of the Expositions The great Paris Universal Expositions of 1878, 1889 and 1900 brought the greatest musicians in the world to Paris to perform, and also introduced musical genres from around the world, including Javanese, Congolese, New Caledonian, Algerian and Vietnamese music, to Paris audiences, The 1889 Exposition offered concerts by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov, while the 1900 Exposition featured band concerts conducted by John Philip Sousa. At the 1900 Exposition, Claude Debussy conducted a grand concert of his work at the Palais de Trocadero. The 1881 Exposition of electricity featured the first transmission of the sound of a musical performance from the Paris opera house to the Palace of Industry, while the 1889 Exposition displayed the new phonograph patented by Thomas Edison, which played the latest songs by Charles Gounod. The caf√© concert, the music hall and the cabaret The Caf√©-Concert by Edgar Degas (1876-77) The caf√© concert was an extremely popular musical venue at the beginning of the Belle √âpoque. Following the 1870 war, sentimental songs and songs calling for revenge against Germany for the loss of Alsace and Lorraine were the staple of all musical cafes. Over the course of the Belle √âpoque, the caf√© chantant evolved into two different musical institutions; some, like Caf√© des Ambassadeurs and the Eldorado, became very large, crowded and filled with noise and smoke, with orchestras, dance reviews, singers and comedy. The music hall originated in England in 1842, and was first imported into France in its British form in 1862, but under the French law protecting the state theaters, performers could not wear consumes or recite dialogue, something only allowed in theaters. When the law changed in 1867, the Paris music hall flourished, and a half-dozen new halls opened, offering acrobats, singers, dancers, magicians, and trained animals. Mistinguett at the Moulin Rouge (1911) The first Paris music hall built specially for that purpose was the Folies-Bergere (1869); it was followed by the Moulin Rouge (1889), the Alhambra (1866), the first to be called a music hall, and the Olympia (1893). The Printania (1903) was a music-garden, open only in summer, with a theater, restaurant, circus, and horse-racing. Older theaters also transformed themselves into music halls, including the Bobino Music Hall (1873), the Bataclan (1864), and the Alcazar (1858). At the beginning , music halls offered dance reviews, theater and songs, but gradually songs and singers became the main attraction. At the end of the Belle Epoque, the music halls began to face competition from movie theaters. The Olympia responded in 1911 with the invention of the grand stairway as a set for its musical and dance spectacles. The smaller, more intimate clubs, called cabarets, focused on individual singers and personal songs, often written by the singer, along with satire and poetry. The Le Chat Noir, neighborhood of Montmartre, was created in 1881 by Rodolphe Salis, a theatrical agent and entrepreneur. It combined music and other entertainment with political commentary and satire.(Haine 8). The Chat Noir brought together the wealthy and famous of Paris with the Bohemians and artists of Montmartre and the Pigalle. Its clientele was described by the historian Paul Bourget: \\"a fantastic mixture of writers and painters, of journalists and students, of employees and high-livers, as well as models, prostitutes and true grand dames searching for exotic experiences.\\" Cited in Fierro, Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris, pg. 738 The composer Eric Satie earned his living after finishing the Conservatory playing the piano at the Chat Noir. By 1896 there were fifty- six cabarets and cafes with music in Paris, along with a dozen music halls. The cabarets did not have a high reputation; one critic wrote in 1897, \\"they sell drinks which are worth fifteen centimes along with verses which, for the most part, are worth nothing.\\".cited in Fierro (1996), page 738 Diaghilev, Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes Afternoon of a Fawn by the Ballets Russes (1912) Russian music became extremely popular in Paris at the end of Belle √âpoque; The orchestras Lamoureux, Colonne, and the Paris Conservatory performed the music of Modest Mussorgsky, Glazunov, Mikhail Glinka, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Tchaikovsky and Scriabin and flocked to hear the singer Chaliapin. In 1907 the French impresario Gabriel Astruc organized a season of Russian music, with performances by Scriabin and Sergei Rachmaninov. Stravinsky and Nijinsky (1911) In 1908 the Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev brought to Paris a production of Boris Gudonov by Mussorgsky, with Chaliapin the leading role, while the Op√©ra-Comique staged The Snow Maiden by Rimsky- Korsakov. In 1909 Diaghilev brought dancers from the Imperial Th√©ater in Saint Petersburg including Vaslav Nijinsky, Anna Pavlova and Ida Rubenstein, to the Ch√¢telet theater with a program of classical ballet. The Paris audiences loved the dancers but were not excited by the ballets, which lost money. For 1910, Diaghilev decided to do something entirely new, and commissioned Ravel to write a ballet, Daphnis and Chlo√´ , for his new company, now called the Ballets Russes. The season made a celebrity of unknown composer, Igor Stravinsky and his ballet The Firebird. The Ballet Russes returned to Paris in 1911 with a new work of Stravinsky, Petrushka and a new version of Daphnis et Chlo√© with choreography by Fokine and sets by Leon Bakst. In 1912, the Ballets Russes presented Afternoon of a Fawn by Debussy, choreographed and danced by Nijinsky. Nijinsky and the ballet were denounced by the French press, which called his performance \\"vile, bestial and erotic\\", and by Debussy himself, though it was defended by many French artists, including Rodin and Odilon Redon. The 1913 season, performed at the new Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, brought a new scandal, with The Rite of Spring, written by Stravinsky and choreographed by Nijinsky. The shouts of the audience during the performance, both for and against the dancers, were so loud that the dancers could not hear the music; the choreographer, in the wings, had to count in a loud voice to help them. The ballet transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure. The outbreak of World War I and the subsequent Russian Revolution of 1917 left the Ballets Russes stranded in Paris. They continued to perform in France and toured around Europe and the world, but never had the opportunity to perform in their own country. Dance‚Äîthe Bal-musette, the cakewalk, the can-can and the tango The can- can by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, 1895 Parisians of all social classes had a passion for dancing. The Bal-musette was a popular kind of dancing venue for working-class Parisians. It originated among the Auvergnats who came to Paris in large numbers in the 19th century. They took place at caf√©s and bars where patrons danced the bourr√©e to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows- blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle √† roue (hurdy- gurdy). Later Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style. The Bal-musettes featured simple, fast and sensual dance steps, often with dancers holding each other very close; it could be danced in a small space.R√©mi Hess : La valse, un romantisme r√©volutionnaire, M√©taili√© editor, Sciences humaines collection, April 2003, p. 147-148. ().Henri Joannis Deberne : Danser en soci√©t√©, Christine Bonneton (editor), 3/1999, Paris. (). The Cakewalk was introduced in Paris in 1903 by pair of American professional dancers, Professor Elk and his wife, at the Nouveau Cirque. The cakewalk was soon featured in other music halls, and was made into an early recording, with the singer Mistinguett. Claude Debussy composed a cakewalk, called Colliwog's cake-walk, between 1906 and 1908. The Can-can originated in the 1820s, and in its original form was danced in cabarets and balls by couples at the fast pace of a galop. It was often described as immoral, because women lifted their shirts and showed their stockings. Beginning in the 1850s, it was modified into stage form, with dancers in a line facing the audience making high kicks, splits and cartwheels; a version which became known as the French can-can. The most famous accompaniment was Offenbach's The Infernal Galop from Orpheus in the Underworld (1858), though it was not written for that dance. The can-can was performed at music halls throughout the Belle √âpoque and remains popular today. The tango was introduced into Paris in 1905, and was popularized by the Argentinian singer and composer Alfredo Gobb and his wife, singer Flora Rodiriguez, who came to Paris in 1907. They became professional tango teachers, and made numerous recordings of their music. It became popular throughout Paris; in 1913, even the President of France, Raymond Poincar√©, danced a few steps of a tango at an official ball. Links to music of the Belle √âpoque * Le Temps des cerises (Music 1866, words 1871) * Maria Callas sing the Habanera from the opera Carmen, by Georges Bizet * Traditional Bal- Musette music * Debussy playing Golliwog's Cakewalk * Excerpt of Stravinsky's ballet Rites of Spring (1913) The Ann√©es Folles (1919-1939) Parade, with music by Eric Satie (1917) The first World War disrupted the Paris musical world; many musicians went into the army, and Ravel, too short to serve in the army, became a volunteer ambulance driver; but it did not stop musical creation altogether. The first cubist musical work, Parade, with a text by Jean Cocteau, music by Eric Satie, decor by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Massine, was presented at the Chatelet theater on May 18, 1917. The poet and critic Apollinaire coined a new word, sur-realism, to describe it. The music by Satie featured an unusual mixture of instruments, including a saxophone, a harp, xylophone, a bouteillophone of bottles filled with varying amounts of water, and various noise-making devices, including a typewriter, siren, and a revolver. The production was denounced by one Paris newspaper as \\"the demolition of our national values\\" but Stravinsky praised it for its opposition to the \\"waves of impressionism, with language that is firm, clear, and without any connection with images.\\" Classical music‚ÄîRavel, Satie and Stravinsky igor Stravinsky Many prominent composers worked in Paris during between the wars, including Maurice Ravel, Erik Satie, and Igor Stravinsky. Ravel was born in 1875; one of his last works, Bol√©ro, written in 1928, became his most famous and most-often performed work. It was written on a commission from the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, who had been a member of the Ballets Russes before starting her own company. The composition was a sensational success when it was premiered at the Paris Op√©ra on November 22, 1928, with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska and designs by Alexandre Benois. Satie (1866-1925) was in poor health, due largely to a long life of excessive drinking. Nonetheless he established connections with the Dadaist movement, and wrote the music for two ballets shortly before his death. Maurice Ravel (1925) Igor Stravinsky (1888-1971) first achieved fame in Paris just before World War I with his revolutionary compositions for the Ballets Russes. In 1920 he returned for a production of a new ballet, Pulcinella, with sets designed by Pablo Picasso. He, his wife and daughter were invited by designer Coco Chanel to stay in her new house in the Paris suburb of Garches. Struggling for money, he obtained a contract with the Paris piano company Pleyel et Cie to re-arrange his music for their popular player pianos. In February 1921 he met the Russian dancer Vera de Bosset and began a long affair with her, both in Paris and on tours around Europe. He became a French citizen in 1931 and moved into a house on the rue de Faubourg-Saint-Honor√©. It was a very unhappy period for him; both his daughter and wife died of tuberculosis. In 1939, as World War II approached, he left Paris for the United States; he married Vera in 1940 and settled in Los Angeles. New musical movements flourished in Paris. The most famous was Les Six, a group of six young French composers; brought together by Jean Cocteau and Eric Satie. They were Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc and Germaine Tailleferre, all born between 1888 and 1899. Their music had no common style; they were united mainly in opposition to the dramatic style of Wagner and the impressionistic style of Debussy and Ravel. They provided music for many colorful theatrical pieces written by Cocteau for the Paris stage. Eric Satie Between the wars, Paris was home to a remarkable colony of foreign composers, including Aaron Copland from the United States (from 1920 to 1925), Heitor Villa-Lobos from Brazil (1923-1930); and B√©la Bart√≥k from Hungary (after 1922). The American composer George Gershwin came to Paris in 1926 and 1928 and tried (without success) to have composition lessons with Ravel and Nadia Boulanger. During his 1928 visit, while staying at the Majestic Hotel, he wrote a symphonic poem, An American in Paris, which, at one point, turned into music the sound of Paris taxi horns on the nearby Etoile. A new three- thousand seat concert hall, the Salle Pleyel, was built in Paris in the interwar period. It was commissioned in 1927 by piano manufacturer Pleyel et Cie and designed by Gustave Lion. The inauguration concert was performed by the Orchestre de la Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, with Robert Casadesus as soloist and Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, and Philippe Gaubert as conductors, A fire ravaged the interior of the hall on 28 June 1928, and it was extensively renovated, and the number of seats reduced to 1,913. Dance‚Äîthe Ballets Russes and Ida Rubinstein Ida Rubinstein, for whom Bol√©ro was written (1922 photo) The most famous Paris dance company was the Ballets Russes, Founded by Sergei Diaghilev in 1909. The company performed in Paris and internationally until Diaghilev's death in 1929. The set designers included Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Joan Mir√≥, and Salvador Dal√≠. Its choreographers included Bronislava Nijinska (1891-1972), the younger sister of the star dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, and a young George Balanchine (1904-1983). In 1924, Balanchine, then a dancer, fled a Soviet dance company on tour in the Weimar Republic and came to Paris, where Diaghilev hired him as a choreographer. The most famous production was the 1924 ballet Le Train Bleu with a story by Cocteau, music by Darius Milhaud, costumes by Coco Chanel and a curtain painted by Picasso. The dancer Ida Rubinstein left the Ballets Russes in 1911 and started her own troupe, commissioning famous poets, including Andr√© Gide and Paul Val√©ry, and composers, including Stravinsky and Honneger, to write ballets for her. Her most famous creation was Bol√©ro, written for her by Ravel, which she first danced at the Paris Opera on November 22, 1928. Ravel originally called the music Fandango, since it much more closely resembled that dance rather than a true bolero. In 1920 a new ballet company, directed by Swedish choreographer and dancer Jean B√∂rlin, was established at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, and then performed in a more intimate new hall, the Studio des Champs-√âlys√©es. Like the Ballets Rousses, B√∂rlin also commissioned famous artists, including Pierre Bonnard and Fernard Leger to create the decor, famous poets including Paul Claudel to write the texts, and avant-garde musicians, including Ravel, Satie and members of the Group of Six, including Taillefere, Milhaud Honnege to write the music. The arrival of jazz‚Äîthe Hot Club de Paris The U.S. Army band conducted by James Reese Europe en route to France (1917) Jazz came to Paris in 1917, with the American soldiers arriving to fight in the First World War. The soldiers were accompanied by military bands, including the 369th regiment band, composed of fifty black musicians directed by a celebrated Broadway band leader, James Reese Europe, and several other regimental bands led by famous American musicians. They gave concerts at the kiosks in the parks of Paris, performing the foxtrot, the two-step, the one-step, and the Memphis Blues and \\"The Army Blues\\" of W.C. Handy. In August 1918, the orchestra of J.R. Europe was invited to perform at a music hall on the Champs-√âlys√©es. The one-night performance was extended for eight weeks. The Casino de Paris presented the first French jazz review, with Gaby Deslys and Harry Pilcer and a ragtime orchestra. A black American jazz orchestra, the Jazz Kings, led by drummer Louis Mitchell, came to the Casino de Paris in 1919 to present a jazz review called Pa-ri-ki- ri, followed in 1920 by the jazz review Laisse-les-Tomber, with the young singer Mistinguett. The author jean Cocteau, enchanted by the new sound, described jazz as \\"an improvised catastrophe\\" and \\"a sonic cataclysm\\". By 1930, Parisians were listening to recordings of American jazz; Duke Ellington brought his orchestra to Paris in 1932, Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway in 1934, Bill Coleman, Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter in 1935. The first famous Paris jazz club, the Hot Club de Paris, was founded in 1932. The first famous French jazz group, the Quintette de Hot Club. was formed in 1934; its members were Django Reinhardt, his brother Joseph, Stephane Grapelli, Louis Vola and Roger Chaput. They became the most famous jazz ensemble in France, touring Europe and eventually to the United States. The music hall‚ÄîMistinguett and Josephine Baker Poster for Mistinguett at the Casino de Paris (1931) The singer Mistinguett made her debut the Casino de Paris in 1895 and continued to appear regularly in the 1920s and 1930s at the Folies Berg√®re, Moulin Rouge and Eldorado. Her risqu√© routines captivated Paris, and she became one of the most highly-paid and popular French entertainers of her time. Josephine Baker at the Folies Bergere (1926) The Swedish ballet performing at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es closed in 1925, and its manager, Andr√© Davin, decided to create a musical show in the American style. He dispatched an American producer, Caroline Dudley, to New York, to recruit a company. She went to Harlem and returned in September 1925 with a troupe of twenty-five black musicians, singers and dancers, including the pianist Claude Hopkins, the clarinetist Sidney Bechet and the twenty-five year old singer Josephine Baker. The new show was called La Revue N√®gre. The director, Jacques Charles, recruited from the Moulin Rouge, persuaded Baker to perform a Charleston called 'Danse sauvage,' half-nude, wearing only ostrich feathers.\\"Le Jazz-Hot: The Roaring Twenties\\", in William Alfred Shack, Harlem in Montmartre: A Paris Jazz Story Between the Great Wars, University of California Press, 2001, p. 35. The audience at opening night on October 25, 1925 included Jean Cocteau, composers Darius Milhaud and Maurice Ravel, and fashion designer Paul Poiret. The show was an immense success. After a successful tour of Europe, Baker returned to France three months later to star at the Folies Berg√®re. The Th√©√¢tre des Champs √âlys√©es continued its American series in July 1926 with the first French performance of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra The other music halls, including the Casino de Paris, Moulin Rouge and les Ambassadeurs presented jazz reviews, while the main concert halls, Pleyel and Gaveau, offered symphonic jazz concerts. New cabarets featuring jazz, including Bricktop's, the Boeuf sur le toit and Grand √âcart opened, and American dance-styles, including the one-step, the fox-trot, the boston and the charleston, became popular in the dance halls. . Chorus of the Folies Berg√®re (1934) The music-halls suffered growing hardships in the 1930s, facing growing competition from movie theaters The Olympia was converted into a movie theater, and others closed. But others continued to thrive; In 1937 and 1930 the Casino de Paris presented shows with Maurice Chevalier, who had already achieved success as an actor and singer in Hollywood. One genre remained highly popular in Paris; the Chanson r√©aliste; dramatic, emotional, tragic songs about love and passion. The leading singers of the genre were Yvonne George, Marie-Louise Damien and Fr√©hel. 1935, a twenty-year old singer named √âdith Piaf was discovered in the Pigalle by nightclub owner Louis Lepl√©e, whose club Le Gerny, off the Champs-√âlys√©es, was frequented by the upper and lower classes alike. He persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Lepl√©e taught her the basics of stage presence and told her to wear a black dress, which became her trademark apparel. Lepl√©e ran an intense publicity campaign leading up to her opening night, attracting the presence of many celebrities, including Maurice Chevalier. Her nightclub appearance led to her first two records produced that same year, and the beginning of a legendary career that continued into the 1960s. The radio, phonograph, and the musical film The arrival of radio and the musical film had a gradual but dramatic impact on Paris music. The first radio station, Radio Eiffel-Tower, broadcast the Eiffel Tower in December, 1921. The first radio concert, of classical music, was broadcast by the station Radiola on November 6, 1922, beginning with a march by Gluck and including symphonic and opera works. In 1929 a weekly series of broadcasts of classical music for school students was launched, but it had limited success, due to the financial crisis; very few Paris schools had money to buy radios. At the beginning of Les Ann√©es Folles, the French company Path√© had a monopoly on the sale of phonograph records in France, and kept out records by other artists. In 1925, the Path√© label was bought by the American company Columbia, and soon American disks began to appear in the French market. After 1926, Parisians could buy records made by other foreign companies. The motion picture had the greatest impact on Paris music. Due largely to competition from the movies, between 1910 and 1920 two- thirds of the Paris music halls were transformed into movie theaters. Collaboration between the Paris movie studios and the film industry had begun early. The composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns had written music to accompany the 1908 film L'Assassinat du duc de Guise. The composer Arthur Honegger composed music for two of the most important silent films of Abel Gance, La Roue and Napoleon. Napoleon had its grand premiere on April 7, 1927 at the Palais Garnier with a full orchestra playing the score. The arrival in France of the first sound film, The Jazz Singer in 1927 caused a revolution in the French movie business, and was quickly followed by the production of French film musicals at the studios just outside Paris. New French films featured the singing talents of Jean Gabin (P√©p√© le Moko, C≈ìur de lilas), and Danielle Darrieux (La crise est finis, Mon c≈ìur t'appelle, Un mauves gar√ßon), Maurice Chevalier et Claudette Colbert (La Chanson de Paris) both made successful careers in Hollywood; Colbert remained in the U.S., but Chevalier returned to Paris and continued his singing career on the Paris music hall stage. Music hall singers, including Fernandel, Frehel and Josephine Baker, began making musical films. The 1934 musical film Zouzou, with Jean Gabin and Josephine Baker, was the first film to star a black actress. The French music industry was born, as movie studios merged with record companies and used films to promote records. The route to success for Paris singers became the recording and film. World War II‚Äîoccupation and liberation The Paris Opera decorated with swastikas for a festival of German music, 1941 (Bundesarchiv) In 1939, in the early days of World War II, the music hall orchestra of Ray Ventura had a popular hit with the song We'll hang out our laundry on the Siegried Line, but many musicians and composers living in Paris, including Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud and Kurt Weil, departed Paris for the United States. The German army crossed the Meuse, and by the end of June occupied Paris. The repression of Jews in the musical world of Paris began; Jewish faculty were dismissed from the Conservatory; Jewish students were banned in 1942. The director of the orchestra of the Conservatory, Roger D√©sormi√®re, helped organize an underground organization of French musicians, with a clandestine newspaper. The new director of the Conservatory, Claude Delvincourt, organized and clandestine music lessons for Jewish pupils. He also organized a student orchestra, and protected the male musicians from being sent to forced labor in Germany by promising to organize concerts for the German soldiers in Paris. The four major symphony orchestras of Paris (Pasdeloupe, Colonne, Lamoureux and the Conservatory Concert Orchestra) continued to perform, giving 650 concerts during the four seasons of the Occupation. The Colonne orchestra, named for the composer √âdourard Lamoureux, was forced to change its name. The Germans also organized a series of thirty-one concerts in Paris by the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Herbert von Karajan, and other German orchestras. French composers and musicians, including Martin Honegger, were invited to participate in music festivals in Vienna and Salzburg. The pianist Alfred Cortot became the Commissioner of Fine Arts of the Vichy government, took part in the Berlin music festival, and made a tour of German cities. French music hall performers continued to perform to audiences of Parisians and German soldiers. The Germans organized a tour to Germany of several the most popular singers, including Maurice Chevalier, √âdith Piaf, and Charles Trenet; they performed for French workers who had been forced to work in German factories. Radio Paris became an important vehicle for Nazi and Vichy propaganda; it had an orchestra of ninety musicians and gave free concerts at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, which featured everything from Beethoven to Tangos and jazz. Jazz was officially banned in Germany as \\"decadent\\"' , and American records were banned after but remained highly popular in occupied Paris. Charles Delaunay organized a jazz festival in Paris in December 1940, and two concerts month were given at the Gaveau, and continued through 1944. Delaunay's band, called Jazz de Paris, gave a concert at the Salle Pleyel on January 16, 1941. The singer Johnny Hess also had an enormous success with his 1940 jazz-swing song, ils sont Zazous. American jazz returned to Paris with the U.S. army on August 25, 1944. The program director of the Voice of America, Sim Copans, equipped a truck with loudspeakers and broadcast excerpts of Gershwin and other American musicians in the Paris streets. The VOA also distributed V-disks, phonograph records with the songs of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Lionel Hampton and Cab Calloway. These were the first American records to arrive in Paris since the war began. Just a month after the liberation of Paris, the first of a series of concerts was performed by the Orchestre national at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, presenting pieces by composers whose work was banned from public performance during the Occupation, including Gustave Mahler, Prokofiev, Stravinsky, Hindemith and Bart√≥k. In May 1945, a Committee of National Cleansing was created for the artistic professions, to investigate musicians accused of collaborating with the Germans. Honegger was censured for touring in Germany, Mistinguett for singing on Radio-Paris. The pianist Alfred Cortot was stripped of his professorship at the Conservatory and moved back to his native Switzerland, but returned to Paris with a triumphant concert at the Salle Pleyel in 1949. Post-war Paris (1946‚Äì2000) Jazz clubs of Saint-Germain-des-Pres Jazz musician Sidney Bechet in 1947 In the early post-war period, immediately after World War II, the Saint-Germain-des-Pres neighborhood and the nearby Saint- Michel neighborhood became home to many small jazz clubs. They were mostly located in cellars, due to the shortage of any suitable space, and because the music at late hours was less likely to disturb the neighbors. The first to open in 1945 was the Caveau des Lorientais, near Boulevard Saint-Michel, which introduced Parisians to New Orleans Jazz, played by clarinetist Claude Luter and his band. It closed shortly afterward, but was soon followed by other cellars; Le Vieux-Columbier, the Rose Rouge, the Club Saint-Germain; and Le Tabou. The jazz clubs The clubs attracted students from the nearby university, the Paris intellectual community, and celebrities from the Paris cultural world. They soon had doormen who controlled who was important or famous enough to be allowed inside into the cramped, smoke-filled cellars. A few of the musicians went on to celebrated careers; Sidney Bechet was the star of the first jazz festival held at the Salle Pleyel in 1949, and headlined at the Olympia music hall in 1955. A concert by Dizzy Gillespie and his orchestra at the Salle Pleyel in 1948 introduced Paris to a new variety of jazz, called bebop, and soon the jazz world of Paris was divided into two rival camps, those for bebop and those for more traditional New Orleans jazz, in the style of Louis Armstrong; this group was led by Sidney Bechet and trumpet player Boris Vian; Mezz Mezzrow, Andr√© Rewellotty, and guitarist Henri Salvador. Beginning in 1958, the leading figures in American jazz, including Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane came to Paris to perform in a series called Paris Jazz Concert, at the Olympia music hall. The musician/ composer Quincy Jones came to Paris both to perform and to study composition with Nadia Boulanger and Olivier Messiaen. Jazz also played an important part in the French New Wave films of the 1950s; the film Les Liaisons dangereuses of Roger Vadim, set in Paris in the 1960s. featured music by Thelonious Monk and Art Blakey; √Ä bout de souffl√© (Breathless) by Jean-Luc Godard had a jazz score music by Martial Solal. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll. Rock and roll Johnny Hallyday in 1965 Rock and roll made its first appearance in Paris in 1956, when pianist and arranger Michel Legrand returned from the United State with American rock and roll records and, with Boris Vian and Henri Salvador, recorded the first French rock and roll records Rock coquet and Rock n'roll mops. In 1957 Legrand and Albert Raisner recorded a French version of Bill Haley's Rock around the Clock and Eddy Constantine recorded Rock! Rock!. At about the same time, the Golf Druout, an indoor miniature golf course at the corner of rue Drouout and boulevard Montmartre installed the first jukebox in Paris, supplied with records from an American military base. The juke box attracted crowds of listeners, and became the first rock-and-roll club in Paris. Among the young musicians who came to the Golf Druout to hear new sound was Jean-Philippe Met, who had changed his name to Johnny Hallyday and became the most enduring Parisian rock singer. The first Parisian rock band, the Five Rocks, was founded at the beginning of the 1960s; it soon changed its name to the Chausettes Noirs (the black socks)The lead singer of the Chausettes noirs, Eddy Mitchell, became famous singing Eddie sois bon, a French remake of Johnny be Good by Chuck Berry. He left the band in 1962 and became a popular film actor. In 1965, the Beatles gave two hugely successful concerts at the Palais des Sports. Rock was firmly installed as the preferred music of young Parisians. Popular music took a big step forward in 1981 when the government gave up its monopoly over radio stations. Two hundred new private radio stations appeared in Paris alone, the great majority devoted entirely to music, covering every genre, including classical, jazz, world music, French songs from the 1920s to 1960s, and every type of rock and roll. Music from the Maghreb, Africa and the Caribbean During the first part of the 20th century, the music from France's colonies in North Africa, sub- Saharan Africa and the Caribbean was largely ignored; or, during the 1900 Universal Exposition and the Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931. it was treated as an exotic novelty, performed by costumed singers and dancers for the benefit of Exposition visitors. That began to change after World War II, when large numbers of temporary workers and students came to live, work and study in Paris. In the 1960s the migration grew even larger, as the colonies were granted their independence. The migrants settled in the outer neighborhoods and suburbs and brought their music with them. The music was almost entirely ignored by the French television and radio stations until 1981 when private radio stations were allowed. Soon dozens of new stations went on the air, playing the music of the new wave of immigrants. The singer Dalida was one of the first musicians from North Africa to achieve fame in Paris. Her father was Italian, the first violinist at the Cairo Opera. She moved to Paris in 1954 at the age of twenty and became a singer at Olympia Paris, and began making recordings. Her song Bambino in 1956 became a hit in France, selling three hundred thousand records, making her one of France's leading popular singers. She recorded Italians in French, Arabic, Italian, and a half-dozen other languages, before her death in 1987. One of the first popular styles imported from North Africa was Ra√Ø, a singing style from the Algerian city of Oran. One of the first famous singer of the style, Khaled, was born in Oran in 1960, started a band when he was fourteen, and moved to France in 1986, where he became a recording star with an international audience. In the 1980s and the 1990s, the traditional African, Maghreb and Caribbean musical styles were blended together with French and American styles of hip-hop, techno, and rap, to create an original style, which became popular well outside the immigrant communities. Musical styles imported into Paris include Sega from the Island of Mauritius. Zouk from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, Zouglou, a dance-oriented style of music from C√¥te d'Ivoire; and Mbalax from Senegal and the Gambia. a fusion of popular Western music and dance such as jazz, soul, Latin, and rock blended with sabar, the traditional drumming and dance music of Senegal. Cabarets and music halls Edith Piaf in 1962 Between 1945 and 1960 the cabarets and music halls played an important part in Paris culture, giving a stage to established stars and new talent. The most important music halls of the period were the Olympia Paris and Bobino, while the important cabarets included La Galerie 55, L'Echelle de Jacob, le Port de Salut, l'Ecluse and Trois Baudets. Future French stars who debuted in the cabarets after the war included Bourvil in 1946, Yves Montand in 1947, Juliette Gr√©co in 1948, Georges Brassens at the Trois Baudets in 1952, and Jacques Brel at the same club in 1953. Headliners at the Olympia included √âdith Piaf in 1949, Gilbert B√©caud in 1954, and Charles Aznavour, Tino Rossi and Dalida in 1955. Paris singing stars in the 1980s and 1990s included Serge Lama, Serge Gainsbourg, Michel Berger, Yves Duteil, Francis Cabrel, Patrick Bruel, and Jean-Jacques Goldman. Classical music‚Äîthe Orchestre de Paris During first decades after the war Paris could boast four top-quality professional symphony orchestras: the Colonne orchestra at the Ch√¢telet; the Lamoureux at Salle Pleyel; the Pasdeloup at the palais de Chaillot, and the Concert Society of the Conservatory at the th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. The orchestras did not coordinate their programs; they played during the same season (October to Easter) at the same time (Sunday afternoons at 5:45) and for the most part played the same classical repertoire, rarely venturing into modern music. In the late 1960s, Andr√© Malraux, the Minister of Culture under President Charles de Gaulle, decided to create a new orchestra as the prestige symphony of Paris. the Society of Concerts of the Conservatory was abolished in 1967, and replaced by the Orchestre de Paris. The French government provided sixty percent of the funding for the new orchestra, with smaller shares from the City of Paris and the Department of the Seine. The first conductor of the orchestra was Charles Munch. After his death in 1968, it was conducted by Herbert von Karajan, then Georg Solti, then Daniel Barenboim, who directed the orchestra from 1975 to 1989. Much musical experimentation was taking place inside other Paris institutions. In 1954 Pierre Boulez founded Le Domaine musical, which between 1954 and 1966, presented regular concerts of new music by composers including Schoenberg and Webern. The most influential modernist composer in post-war Paris was Olivier Messiaen (1908-1992), organist at the Trinity Church beginning in 1930 and professor at the Paris Conservatory of Music from 1942. he was noted for his scientific study of bird songs (1958), his adaptations of traditional Asian and Latin American rhythms (1960); and original church music. Other notable composers included Pierre Schaeffer, founder of the school called Musique concr√®te, based on recorded sounds of the real world, such as the noise made by trains; and composer of Symphonie pour un home seul (1950) and Orph√©e 51 (1951); the composer Pierre Henry, a collaborator of Schaeffer, pioneer of electroacoustic music; and composer of The Well-Tempered microphone; and the conductor and composer Boulez, a pioneer of Serial music. Musical theater‚Äîthe mega-musical Musical theater had a difficult time in the postwar years, due to stiff competition from musical films and high production costs. The exceptions were several mega-musicals first produced in Paris; Les Mis√©rables, based on the novel by Victor Hugo, with music by Claude-Michel Sch√∂nberg and original French lyrics by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, opened in Paris in 1980, and went on to success in London and New York, and became one of the most popular musicals of all time. Notre Dame de Paris, also based on a novel by Victor Hugo, with music composed by Riccardo Cocciante and lyrics by Luc Plamondon, opened on September 16, 1998, and made immediate stars of its lead singers, H√©l√®ne S√©gara as Esmeralda and Garou, who played Quasimodo. The Bastille Opera and the City of Music The Op√©ra Bastille, opened in 1989 When President Fran√ßois Mitterrand took office in 1981, his new culture minister, Jack Lang, launched a series musical innovations. On June 21, 1982, he began the Fete de la Musique, a day of free musical performances all over Paris and in other cities of France. A giant rock concert took place at the Trocadero, the opera orchestra played on the steps of the Opera Garnier, and the Garde Republicaine band played at the Pantheon. The Fete became an annual event. He also planned and began construction of a second opera house at Place de la Bastille, in place of an old suburban train station. Revolution. It was designed to have an equally good view from all seats (unlike the Palais Garnier) and to have less expensive tickets. After many technical problems, design changes, controversies and the dismissal of the opera's director, the Opera Bastille opened in July 1989.during the celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution. Philharmonie de Paris: Philharmonie 1 The second grand musical project of Mitterrand and Lang, announced in 1982, was the Cit√© de la Musique, a large musical performance center at La Villette, a former- industrial section of the city. The first piece built was the Le Z√©nith, a concert hall with six thousand seats, inaugurated on January 12, 1984. It hosted concerts by Johnny Halladay, Serge Gainsbourg, Vanessa Paradis, the rock group T√©l√©phone, and other celebrated Paris pop musicians. The Paris Conservatory of Music was moved to a new building on the site, opened to students in 1990. The museum of musical instruments of the Conservatory was opened at the beginning of 1997. The final piece, the Philharmonie de Paris concert hall, designed by architect Jean Nouvel, with 2,500 seats, was opened on January 24, 2015.

Pests and diseases During the five-year USDA - ARS North Central Region trial period, there was no indication of any disease or insect pests. However, there is no record of the tree having been scientifically tested by inoculation for resistance to Dutch elm disease. Cultivation USDA trial The USDA - ARS North Central Region trial in the 1950s saw 50 plants of this clone, obtained from the L. R.

As a consequence of the trial, 'Fremont' was considered suitable for planting across the north central region, with the exception of North Dakota and the extreme north of Minnesota. The clone was recommended as a specimen tree for urban lawns and streets, particularly 'in situations requiring quick shade'. However, the tree does not appear to have been a commercial success. Three specimens planted at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Arboretum in 1957 died or were removed owing to storm damage or poor branching.

Released on September 12, 1997 by Atlantic Records, it was the band's major-label debut single and served as the parent album's lead single. The track was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, and was produced by the latter two. A pop song, \\"The Best Thing\\" is accompanied by several guitars and a keyboard. It was distributed to radio stations for airplay in September 1997, coinciding with the release of two CD singles. Rumors of a music video for the single circulated during the same month, although one was ultimately never released. \\"The Best Thing\\" was also pressed as a 7\\" jukebox single in Italy, where it was paired with the B-side track \\"A Nanny in Manhattan\\", performed by the American band Lilys. music critics praised \\"The Best Thing\\", with several calling it one of the catchiest tracks on Apartment Life.  Background and release  \\"The Best Thing\\" was taken from Ivy's second studio album, Apartment Life, which was released on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. The single was released in three formats; the commercial CD single includes the album version of \\"The Best Thing\\" while a promotional Italy 7\\" jukebox single, released by East West Records, used Ivy's song as the A-side and Lilys \\"A Nanny in Manhattan\\" as the B-side. Another promotional CD single was also created containing the \\"Video Remix\\" of the track. According to the liner notes of the promotional release, Atlantic Records billed \\"The Best Thing\\" as Ivy's official debut single. Following its distribution as a physical single, \\"The Best Thing\\" was serviced to modern rock and modern adult contemporary radio stations beginning September 12, 1997. The record label had hoped that Ivy would receive considerable radio airplay, in light of musical trends during the same time period when Apartment Life was scheduled to be released. Michael Krumper, the vice president of product development for Atlantic Records, predicted this, given that \\"there are a number of records that have a similar feel to Ivy\\". Prior to the scheduled release date for Apartment Life, Ivy was scheduled for a promotional radio tour in September 1997. Around this same time, Billboard announced that a music video for \\"The Best Thing\\" would complete filming and production by the end of the same month; however, an official video was never released for the single, despite another Billboard article describing preparations for filming in November of that same year.  Composition and production  \\"The Best Thing\\" was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase, with the latter two also serving as producers. Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade contributed as the mixers, with Matthew Ellard serving as an assistant mixer; Bob Ludwig finalized the mastering and James Iha contributed backing vocals to the track. It was recorded in New York City in 1997 at three recording studios: The Place, Duotone Studios, and Compositions. A pop song, it features \\"rippling atmospherics\\" and a \\"punk-ish guitar\\", with a user from Sputnikmusic commenting that it may have been influenced by the American band Pixies. Its production consists of a \\"briskly strummed\\" acoustic guitar and a triplet-playing keyboard. Durand \\"stretch[es] out each syllable\\" while singing in a style that is reminiscent of the German musician Nico during the lyrics: \\"She's driving fast / She took the family car / She's getting high / She's never slipped so far\\". As the chorus begins, she repeats \\"It's the best thing / She's ever had\\" regularly alongside several guitars.  Critical reception  \\"The Best Thing\\" was praised by music critics. AllMusic's Jack Rabid was extremely positive, calling it a \\"true single with a chorus that is to swoon and croon for\\". Vickie Gilmer and Ira Robbins from Trouser Press described the song as an \\"engaging opener\\" and lauded it and album track \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" for being catchy. Frank Tortorici from MTV News agreed, and predicted that it would likely \\"succeed at radio if given a chance\\". Calling it \\"sensuous\\", Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club claimed that the rest of Apartment Life does not match the quality of \\"The Best Thing\\", but also stated that the entire album \\"never slips too far\\" because the end product includes \\"impeccably tasteful performances\\".

The Pacific Plate (triangle at bottom) has just been created. The Terra Australis Orogen (TAO) was the oceanic southern margin of Gondwana which stretched from South America to Eastern Australia and encompassed South Africa, West Antarctica, New Zealand and Victoria Land in East Antarctica.  Origins  Terra Australis Orogen formed in the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic. The decline of orogenic activity in the late Paleozoic is related to the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea. The orogeny did not end by a continental collision and was succeeded by the Gondwanide orogeny. long and up to wide, the TAO was one of the longest and longest-lived active continental margin in the history of Earth, lasting from the beginning of its formation during the break-up of the Neoproterozoic supercontinent Rodinia. The TAO evolved through a series of extensional back-arcs separated by compressional events when the subducting oceanic plate got stuck in Gondwana's margin. As Gondwana was amalgamated in the Early Palaeozoic during the so-called Pan-African orogenies the TAO propagated along the southern (modern coordinates) Proto-Pacific/Iapetus margin of the supercontinent. The TAO ended with the Gondwanide orogeny. This and younger orogens covers most of the outboard margin of the TAO, and, likewise, the inboard margin is almost entirely covered by younger deposits and ice but remains exposed in Australia along the Torrens Hinge Line or Delamarian orogeny. One end of the TAO was a series of terranes (Avalonia‚ÄìCarolina‚ÄìCadomia) which were rifted off the western margin of Gondwana and added to Laurentia in the Late Palaeozoic, while its other end probably reached past Australia into New Guinea. In 1937 Alexander du Toit proposed the Samfrau Orogeny as an evidence for Gondwana. His concept includes the orogenies of West Gondwana and orogenies that are now considered separate events but excludes those of East Gondwana.

He was also a writer, poet, composer, educator, and diplomat. The greatest accomplishment of Serbian literature and theology happened under Patriarch Pajsije who inspired the revival of hagiographical literature and entered into theological debates with Pope Gregory XV and particularly with Pope Urban VIII concerning the question of the procession of the Holy Spirit. He patronized art on a grand scale. He funded works by woodcarvers of iconostasis and icon painters during his entire reign as patriarch from 1614 to 1648. His travels took him to Moscow in 1622, Constantinople in 1641, and Jerusalem in 1646. He was born in Janjevo, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire, the son of a clergyman, Dimitrije. He was educated in his birth town where the wealthy folks of Janjevo had their own school which he attended regularly and continued his education at the seminary of Graƒçanica monastery. He was a pupil of Jovan Kantul. Early in life he showed that he was a great \\"book lover\\" and a very cultured man who took care to preserve manuscripts scattered about various monasteries. He himself was a writer. Patriarch Pajsije states in one of his works, \\"Service to Tsar Uro≈°\\" (Stefan Uro≈° V), he put in it \\"Troparion\\" and \\"Kontakion\\"‚Äîwriting first the Sticheron of the small vespers .... \\"all in the order required by liturgy.\\" Metropolitan of Novo Brdo and Lipljan Pajsije was elected Metropolitan of Novo Brdo and Lipljan in 1612. He was consecrated by Patriarch Jovan II Kantul and the Metropolitans of Sentence Synod on July 15, 1612. Today, there still exists one document in which he signed his name as \\"Humble Pajsije, Metropolitan of Novo Brdo.\\" When Patriarch Jovan left for Constantinople in 1614, he appointed Pajsije as locum tenens. Patriarch Jovan was accused by the sultan's court for collaborating with the Holy Roman Empire and sentenced to death. This occurred four years prior to the Thirty Years' War. Serbian Patriarch When the news of Jovan's sentence arrived in Peƒá, Pajsije was elected patriarch on October 4, 1614. The new patriarch soon established relations with Tsardom of Russia. His name appeared in Russian state documents beginning in 1622 during the reign of Patriarch Philaret of Moscow and his son, Emperor Michael I of Russia. Pajsije often traveled. He visited the half- devastated ≈Ωiƒça Monastery in 1620 and began its repair. He visited Belgrade in 1632 and ≈†i≈°atovac Monastery, which contains the relics of Saint Stefan ≈†tiljanoviƒá on October 7, 1632. The patriarch, together with Jeftimije, Metropolitan of Ni≈° and Leskovac, also visited Bishop Maxim Predojeviƒá of the Eparchy of Marƒça in Austro-Hungary (today's Croatia). The militant policy of Patriarch Jovan ended with his mysterious death in Constantinople (Istanbul) but his successor, Pajsije adopted a more passive policy with both the Turk in Constantinople and the Pope in Rome. Pajsije I Janjevac realized that open rebellion could not set things right. Very early on he turned for aid to Tsardom of Russia which had for a while already been a source of literary (service books) and some financial support. As the head of the Church, he worked earnestly to strengthen the faltering spirit of the nation through constant celebration of Liturgy and by intense writing. He wrote the biography of the last Serbian emperor, Uro≈°, and composed a Service to him. In his \\"Life of Emperor Uro≈°\\", Pajsije sought to connect this ruler to the uninterrupted line of Serbian history. His work started with the Nemanjiƒá ancestry and continued to own time, with Uro≈°'s life representing only one episode. In the book, Pajsije himself reveals his larger ambition: It was my desire to understand and learn this: whence the Serbs originated, and for what purpose. He also wrote the Service to St. Symon (Stefan the First-Crowned) and his successor, Gavrilo I (1648‚Äì1655) who, like Jovan Kantul, would die a martyr's death while in Turkish captivity in Bursa in 1659. Pajsije's policy towards the Turks was compromising, and ever changing with every new sultan. He outlived five of them, (Ahmed I, Mustafa I, Osman II, Murad IV and Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire). He also contemplated the question of union with the Roman church informing Pope Urban VIII about main obstacles separating Catholics and Orthodox faithful alike. In November 1642, a Roman Catholic emissary, Francesco Leonardi (missionary), arrived in Peƒá. In the pope's name, he tried to start negotiations towards union. Patriarch Pajsije, together with two bishops, discussed this with him. Pajsije was strongly against the filioque. He was ready to recognize the pope's primatum honoris, but only if the pope gave up the filioque, azyme, and other new teachings. This was stated in a synodical letter that was sent to Rome. At the time, the curia in Rome had a program of compulsory conversion to Catholicism that would transfer Serbs into Croats by first having them join the Uniate Church, like in Kiev. In 1640, the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Propaganda of the Faith (Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples) sought to gain Mardarije Korneƒçanin of Montenegro and Patriarch Pajsije, to the church union. Mardarije was also in favour of placing Montenegro under Venetian suzerainty. But Pajsije's policy was far more prudent, balancing his nation's best interests between the East and the West. With a conciliatory policy, Pajsije managed to alleviate the hardship of slavery and promote the Serbian spiritual and national revival, constantly reminding his people of their glorious past and Serbian statehood. By his wise policy and correct relationship towards Serbian cultural inheritance, Patriarch Pajsije succeeded in creating an atmosphere which produced an unexpected enthusiasm for building and decorating temples. He did not forget Ni≈°, as well. In 1647, in his last days of life, he noted in the book that he was always carrying with himself - \\"Peƒá Memorabilia: Dorotej, Ni≈°\\". The question has still remained unanswered whether he visited Ni≈° with the mentioned Dorotej or he may have sent his assistant Dorotej to Ni≈°. Nevertheless, this is a valuable document and an important confirmation of the enlightened activities of Patriarch Pajsije in the area of Ni≈°. His presence at Ni≈°, as well as throughout the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá, contributed to the revival of cultural and religious life. His activities in the Ni≈° region are reflected in the construction and restoration of Serbian churches and monasteries, as well as in the work of producing book, printing and publishing. In the seventeenth century, Patriarch Pajsije made great efforts to save older manuscripts, which he himself rebound and placed in safer monasteries or returned to their owners. Patriarch Pajsije used his time in rebuilding and repairing churches, transliterating, and translating books. The church in Moraƒça Monastery was painted in 1614 by Hilandar monks. Serbian noblemen rebuilt the Dobrilovina Monastery in 1614 and its church in ƒåukojevac. The patriarch was an avid book collector. Western diplomats who traveled to the Southeastern Europe bore witness that the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá was well-organized. He canonized the last ruler from the Nemanjiƒái dynasty, Emperor Stefan Uro≈° V. Patriarch Pajsije was forced to visit Constantinople in 1641 to obtain protection from local Turkish governors. Death Patriarch Pajsije was wounded by a bull in the village of Budosavci. He died a few days later on November 2, 1647 and was buried in Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá.

Adenomyomatosis is caused by an overgrowth of the mucosa, thickening of the muscular wall, and formation of intramural diverticula or sinus tracts termed Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses, also called entrapped epithelial crypts. Pathophysiology Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder as seen on ultrasound Non-contrast abdominal ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder: a The fundus of the gallbladder wall was thickened and the GB wall was obscure. b The intramural echogenic foci were detected by high frequency transducer. c CEUS‚Äîarterial phase (22 s) ‚Äîheterogeneous hyper-enhancement and wall was intact. d CEUS‚Äîvenous phase (34 s) the anechoic spaces were more clear. Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses are pseudodiverticula or pockets in the wall of the gallbladder. They may be microscopic or macroscopic. Histologically, they are outpouchings of gallbladder mucosa into the gallbladder muscle layer and subserosal tissue as a result of hyperplasia and herniation of epithelial cells through the fibromuscular layer of the gallbladder wall. Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses are not of themselves considered abnormal but they can be associated with cholecystitis. They form as a result of increased pressure in the gallbladder and recurrent damage to the wall of the gallbladder. Associations Black pigment gallstones can form in Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses of the gallbladder after the fourth to fifth decades of life in absence of the typical risk factors for bilirubin suprasaturation of bile. Hence, they are associated with gallstones (cholelithiasis). Cases of gall bladder cancer have also been reported to arise from Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses. Diagnosis Abdominal ultrasound has low accuracy in differentiating gall bladder adenomyomatosis from cancer and is operator dependent. However, it is used as the exam of the first-line due to its wide availability. Ultrasound findings may show thickened gall bladder wall, tiny anechoic spaces (Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses or RAS), and twinkling artifact (or comet-tail reverberation). Comet tail reverberation, which is due to reflections from cholesterol crystals, is a highly specific sign for adenomyomatosis. On CT scan, it may show rosary sign, showing mucosal epithelium with intramural diverticula. Magnetic resonance imaging also plays an important role in the diagnosis of Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses. In fat-suppression MRI, RAS present with small, rounded, high signal intensity foci, called ‚Äúpearl necklace sign‚Äù. Eponym Rokitansky‚ÄìAschoff sinuses are named after Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky (1804‚Äì1878), a pathologist in Vienna, Austria and Ludwig Aschoff (1866‚Äì1942), a pathologist in Bonn, Germany.

It was one of the first large scale tokamak machines, and among the most powerful in terms of current and magnetic fields. A key feature was the use of external heating systems to raise the temperature of the plasma fuel, a requirement of any practical fusion power device. The tokamak became a topic of serious discussion in 1968, and the PPPL was convinced to convert their Model C stellarator to the tokamak configuration. It immediately validated the Soviet results. These early machines had no effective way to heat the plasma, so PPPL built the Adiabatic Toroidal Compressor to test one method of heating, adiabatic compression, while the PLT was designed to test another, neutral beam injection. The PLT was extremely successful. It was the first tokamak with a plasma current over 1 MA.Fusion: The Energy of the Universe In 1978 it heated its plasma to 60 million degrees C, just above the critical threshold for a \\"burning plasma\\" that is seen as key to practical devices.

It begins in the western foothills of the Cascade Range at Crabtree Mountain near Crabtree Lake. From there it flows generally west to meet the larger stream about upstream of where the South Santiam merges with the North Santiam River to form the Santiam River. The map includes mile markers along the lower of the creek. Oregon Route 226 crosses the creek between Crabtree on the south and Scio on the north about from the mouth. The unincorporated community of Lacomb lies south of the creek, along one of its tributaries slightly west of the Cascade foothills. Bridges In addition to the Route 226 bridge, the creek flows under two covered bridges. Larwood Bridge carries Fish Hatchery Road over the creek at Larwood Wayside Park, about north of Lacomb and by water from the creek mouth. Further downstream, Hoffman Bridge carries Hungry Hill Drive over the creek about a mile north of Crabtree and from the mouth. Recreation Larwood Park lies at the confluence of Roaring River with Crabtree Creek about by water from the creek mouth. Covering , it has picnic tables, river views, a footbridge, a waterwheel that formerly powered a mill at the site, as well as places to fish and swim. Ripley's Believe It or Not! once listed the confluence as the only one in the world where a stream named \\"river\\" emptied into a stream named \\"creek\\". This was, however, incorrect. Fall River is a tributary of Clear Creek in Colorado. Fishing for wild cutthroat trout in the creek is permitted on a catch-and-release basis; fishing for steelhead is not allowed. The creek is not stocked with hatchery fish. Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run parts of Crabtree Creek in kayaks or other craft. A run from the North Fork Bridge to Larwood Park, is rated class 3T or 4 (intermediate or advanced) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. The run below that is less difficult. Hazards include rocks, logs, overhanging limbs, and a dangerous barbed-wire fence across most of the river a few miles downstream of the Route 226 bridge.

It is located approximately two miles / 3 kilometers north of Dedoplistsqaro in the region of Kakheti. The castle's ruined remains are sited on the imposing Tsiv-Gombori Range. It was probably constructed, originally, at the end of the 1st millennium BC, at which time it was the only fortification controlling the valleys of the Iori and Alazani rivers. Archeology conducted during the 1970s in the area uncovered extensive evidence of the settlement that flourished in the flat land beneath the castle during and before the medieval period. The first surviving written records of it date back to the reign of Vakhtang the Wolf Head during the 5th century. At that time Khornabuji was one of the largest settlements in the Kakheti region. According to the chronicle it was one of several places to which Vakhtang appointed a bishop after he had built the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral at Mtskheta. Late in the 5th or early during the 6th century Khornabuji was conquered by the Sasanians. It appears the surrounding town was destroyed, though something of the castle survived and over the following centuries the town again appeared on the area of flat ground to the south of the castle rock. During the thirteenth century, according to some sources, the castle was rebuilt on the instructions of Queen Tamara, although others suggest that references to Queen Tamara building a castle may have referred to a castle built at another site. According to one interpretation of the sources the Khornabuji township was destroyed by Mongul invaders under Berke Khan around 1264, and survivors relocated to Sighnaghi, after which there was no further significant settlement outside the castle walls. An alternative view is that it was during the seventeenth century the settlement fell into ruin following the invasion undertaken from Iran by ShƒÅh AbbƒÅs. The castle was later rebuilt under Heraclius II of Kartli-Kakheti, but the surrounding township was not rebuilt.

Location The hospital of St. Anthony when mentioned later was certainly in the now defunct parish of St. Benet Fink (an abbreviation of \\"St Benedict Finch\\"), near today's Threadneedle Street. However, it is unlikely a synagogue had ever occupied a site in the parish of St. Benet Fink, as such Jewish places of worship were confined to the Jewry district of the City, some distance away to the east. It is possible therefore that either the brothers changed their quarters afterwards or at one time the Jews had spread beyond the Jewry. Such an outlying synagogue may have been permitted by the 1252/3 decree of King Henry III (1216-1272) that there should be no synagogues except where they existed during the reign of his father King John (1199‚Äì1216). Establishment and funding The brothers of St. Anthony of Vienne established a cell before 1254 on some land given to them by King Henry III, in a place previously occupied by a Jewish synagogue. In the bull of Pope Alexander V confirming the grant the place is not further described. The house was founded to look after twelve poor men, and was governed by a Master, two priests and a schoolmaster. The hospital appears to have been funded by ad hoc donations of alms, not by an endowment, as in 1291 the whole property within in the parish of St. Benet Fink was not worth more than the small sum of 8 shillings per annum. A St Anthony's belled pig, fresco circa 1300, Saint Matthew's Church, Murau in Styria, Austria One source of income, traditional to certain religious foundations dedicated to Saint Anthony the Great of Egypt, was from donated free-range pigs: any pig considered by the supervisor of the London Livestock market unfit to be killed for food was reserved for the use of the Hospital as follows: a proctor of St. Anthony's placed a collar around its neck from which hung a bell. It was then released onto the City streets to scavenge, protected by the status afforded by its bell, from molestation by the population.VCH it was a virtuous deed to feed these pigs, which quickly fattened and when ready for the table were reclaimed by the Hospital and sold or slaughtered for food.VCH The privilege appears on occasion to have been abused, as in 1311 one of the Hospital's tenants Roger de Wynchester, was forced to promise the City authorities not to claim pigs found wandering about the City, nor to put bells on \\"any swine but those given in charity to the house\\".VCH History In 1310 the brothers built a new chapel, for which they had neglected to obtain the permission of the Bishop of London. Judgement was given against the brothers in August, 1311, in the Court of Arches, when the chapel was judged to be prejudicial to the Bishop and to the parish church of St. Benet Fink, and was to be reduced to the form of a private house within eight days on pain of greater excommunication. During the wars with France and the schism the hospital was cut off from communication with the parent house at Vienne. In 1380 the warden Geoffrey de Lymonia was excused by the antipope Clement VII from making contributions due to Vienne. In 1389 King Edward III appointed as warden one of his clerks, John Macclesfield, in place of the papal choice for the position. Pope Boniface IX confirmed his appointment on condition he should become a monk within three months, which on his failure so to do resulted in the pope making his own appointment. The pope later relented and allowed Macclesfield to hold the position for ten years. The hospital was by then virtually a royal \\"free chapel\\" and this may account for the benefits conferred on it by Pope Boniface IX. In 1392 he granted 100 days' remission of penance to those who during seven years should visit the \\"House of St. Anthony\\" on the chief festivals connected with Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and St. Anthony, and gave alms towards the fabric of the chapel and for the maintenance of the sick and poor. In 1392 he also gave it the revenues of All Saints Church, Hereford, and of the annexed chapel of St. Martin, which had been given to the house at Vienne in 1249 by King Henry III. Shortly before 1400 the advowson of St. Benet Fink's parish church had been donated to the Hospital by two Citizens of London, John Sauvage and Thomas Walington, and in that year the pope donated in addition that church's revenues to the Hospital. However, as later disputes between the church and Hospital attest this grant was not put into effect. In 1440 St. Benet's Church was again donated to the hospital by the Bishop of London for the maintenance of a grammar school. Macclesfield had in fact misappropriated the Hospital's funds by disposing of much of its property and by the granting of pensions to his children, and other persons, and in 1424 the pope ordered the bishop of Winchester to annul such alienations as should be found unlawful. (fn. 24) In 1429 the Master acquired adjoining land from the Abbot of St. Albans and enlarged the building and formed a garden and cemetery. The new building was uncompleted in 1441, and the Hospital was then described by King Henry VI as \\"wretched and almost desolate, reduced to the very verge of poverty\\". In 1442 King Henry VI granted to the Hospital the manor of Pennington with pensions in Milburn, Tunworth, Charlton, and Up-Wimborne, Hampshire, in order to maintain five scholars at Oxford University, who were first to study grammar at his royal foundation of Eton College. In 1449 a bequest was made in by the will of William Wyse of his brewery \\"Le Coupe super le hoop\\" in the parish of Allhallows London Wall, for the purpose of maintaining a priest to instruct the children of St. Anthony's in singing as well as praying for his soul. Alien Priory During the French wars in 1414 the Alien Priories Act was signed by King Henry V which confiscated into the king's hands the English property of all French mother- houses, and the Hospital was treated henceforth as a royal free chapel. Later King Henry VI appointed the wardens and King Edward IV on two occasions granted to a third party the right to present a Master on the next vacancy. The popes evidently acquiesced with the royal confiscation as in 1446 Pope Eugenius IV gave leave to the bishops of Worcester and Norwich, the Provost of Eton and the Warden William Say, to make statutes for the Hospital and in 1447 Pope Nicholas V exempted the Hospital from all spiritual and temporal jurisdiction, especially from that of the former mother-house of St. Anthony, Vienne. The Hospital did not exist for long as an independent house and in 1475 was annexed and appropriated to the College of St. George, Windsor Castle. It was at that time a profitable enterprise, with receipts in 1478‚Äì9 of ¬£539 19 shillings exceeding expenses by ¬£96 4 shillings 10 pence. \\"From the accounts it may be gathered that the surplus was not obtained by stinting the inmates of food\\".VCH Largely due to financing by Sir John Tate, an Alderman of the City of London, the church was rebuilt in 1499 on the old now enlarged site. St. Anthony's pigs still existed in 1525 and in 1537 an agent of St. Anthony's was recorded collecting offerings and selling hallowed bells for cattle. Dissolution of the Monasteries At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Hospital was despoiled, not as was usual by the crown, but by a prebendary of Windsor named Johnson, who gave each almsman in compensation for the loss of his room a weekly pension of 1 shilling. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603) the church was let to French Protestants. Landholdings In 1565 the Hospital possessed lands including the following: : * Manor of Esehall (earlier spelled as \\"Esthall\\") * Manor of Walens (earlier spelled as \\"Valance\\") * Manor of Fryslyng (earlier spelled as \\"Thyrstelyng\\") * 'Jurdens land' in Essex; * Rectories of All Saints and St. Martin in the City of Hereford, in the possession of the house since 1392 * A tenement in Winchester, * A tenement in Portsmouth, * Tenements in the City of London, including three tenements near the school, and the capital messuage, called 'Lady Tate's House,' then tenanted by Sir Henry Sydney and the Rectory of St. Benet Fink. Stowe's Survey of London John Stow (1524‚Äì1605) in his 1598 Survey of London wrote of St Anthony's Hospital thus:Stow, John, Survey of London, 1598, 1842 edition, London, ed. Thoms, William J., pp.70-1 :\\"Some distance west from this the Merchant-Tailors' Hall is Finke's Lane, so called of Robert Finke, and Robert Finke his son, James Finke, and Rosamond Finke. Robert Finke the elder new built the parish church of St. Bennet, commonly called Fink, of the founder; his tenements were both of St. Bennet's parish and St. Martin's Oteswich parish. The one half of this Finke lane is of Brode Street ward, to wit, on the west side up to the great and principal house wherein the said Finke dwelt; but on the other side, namely the east, not so much successive confirmation, by inspeximus, of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Philip and Mary, Elizabeth, and James I towards Comhill. Then without this lane in the aforesaid Threeneedle Street is the said parish church of St. Bennet, a proper church, in which are these monuments of the dead: Robert Simson, and Elizabeth his wife; Roger Strange, esquire; Trerisse; William Coolby; John Frey; Thomas Briar, plumber, 1410, &c.; Some distance west is the Royal Exchange, whereof more shall be spoken in the ward of Cornhill, and so down to the little conduit, called the pissing conduit, by the Stockes Market, and this is the south side of Threeneedle Street. On the north side of this street, from over against the east corner of St. Martin's Oteswich church, have ye divers fair and large houses till ye come to the hospital of St. Anthonie, sometime a cell to St. Anthonie's of Vienna. For I read that King Henry III granted to the brotherhood of St. Anthonie of Vienna, a place amongst the Jews, which was sometime their synagogue, and had been built by them about the year 1231; but the Christians obtained of the king that it should be dedicated to our Blessed Lady; and since a hospital being there built, was called St. Anthonie's in London; it was founded in the parish of St. Bennet Finke, for a master, two priests, one schoolmaster, and twelve poor men: after which foundation, amongst other things, was given to this hospital, one messuage and garden, whereon was built the fair large free school, and one other parcel of ground, containing thirty-seven feet in length, and eighteen feet in breadth, whereon was built the alms houses of hard stone and timber, in the reign of Henry VI, which said Henry VI, in the 20th of his reign, gave unto John Carpenter, D.D., master of St. Anthonie's hospital, and to his brethren and their successors for ever, his manor of Ponington, with the appurtenances, with certain pensions and portions of Milburne, Burnworth, Charlton, and Up Wimboroe, in the county of Southampton, towards the maintenance of five scholars in the University of Oxford, to be brought up in the faculty of arts, after the rate of ten pence the week for every scholar, so that the said scholars shall be first instructed in the rudiments of grammar at the College of Eaton, founded by the said king. In the year 1474, Edward IV granted to William Say, B.D., master of the said hospital, to have priests, clerks, scholars, poor men, and brethren of the same, clerks, or laymen, choristers, proctors, messengers, servants in household, and other things whatsoever, like as the prior and convent of St. Anthonie's of Vienna, &c.; He also annexed, united, and appropriated the said hospital unto the collegiate church of St. George in Windsor. The proctors of this house were to collect the benevolence of charitable persons towards the building and supporting thereof. And amongst other things observed in my youth, I remember that the officers charged with oversight of the markets in this city, did divers times take from the market people, pigs starved, or otherwise unwholesome for man's sustenance; these they slit in the ear. One of the proctors for St. Anthonie's tied a bell about the neck, and let it feed on the dunghills; no man would hurt or take them up, but if any gave to them bread, or other feeding, such would they know, watch for, and daily follow, whining till they had somewhat given them; whereupon was raised a proverb, \\"Such an one will follow such an one, and whine as it were an Authonie pig\\"; but if such a pig grew to be fat, and came to good liking (as ofttimes they did), then the proctor would take him up to the use of the hospital. In the year 1499, Sir John Tate, sometime ale-brewer, then a mercer, caused his brewhouse, called the Swan, near adjoining to the said free chapel, college, or hospital of St. Anthonie, to be taken down for the enlarging of the church, which was then new built, toward the building whereof the said Tate gave great sums of money, and finished in the year 1501. Sir John Tate deceased 1514, and was there buried under a fair monument by him prepared. Dr. Tayler, Master of the Rolls, and other. Walter Champion, draper, one of the sheriffs of London 1529, was buried there, and gave to the beadmen twenty pounds. The lands by year of this hospital were valued in the 37th year of Henry VIII to be fifty-five pounds six shillings and eight pence. One Johnson (a schoolmaster of the famous free-school there) became a prebend of Windsor, and then by little and little followed the spoil of this hospital. He first dissolved the choir, conveyed the plate and ornaments, then the bells, and lastly put out the almsmen from their houses, appointing them portions of twelve pence the week to each (but now I hear of no such matter performed), their houses with other be letten out for rent, and the church is a preaching place for the French nation. This school was commended in the reign of Henry VI, and sithence commended above other, but now decayed, and come to nothing, by taking that from it what thereunto belonged\\". This goodly foundation having a free schoole and almes houses for poore men (builded of hard stone) adjoyning to the west end of the church, was of olde time confirmed by Henry the Sixt, in the year 1447. The outward work of this new church was finished in the year 1501, the said John Tate deceased about the year 1514, and was there buried in a monument by him prepared, as appeareth by an indenture tripartite made between the said John Tate, the Deane of Windsor, and William Milbourn, chamberlaine.\\" (Stow, 1st edition, p. 145). Thom's editorial comment: Pigs have long been placed under the protection of St. Anthony. \\"The bristled hogges doth Anthonie preserve and cherish well,\\" says Barnabe Googe in The Popish Kingdom, fol. 95. And in The World of Wonders is the following epigram upon the subject: ::\\"Once fed'st thou, Anthony, an herd of swine, ::And now an herd of monkes thou feedest still; ::For wit and gut alike both charges bin; ::Both loven filth alike; both like to fill ::Their greedy paunch alike. Nor was that kind ::More beastly, sottish, swinish, than this last, ::All else agrees; one fault I only find ‚Äî ::Thou feedest not thy monks with oaken mast.\\" :A very curious illustration of the custom recorded by Stow is to be found in Bale's comedy of Thre Lawes, 1538, where Infidelity begins his address: \\" Good Christen people, I'm come hyther verelye as a true proctour of the howse of S. Antonye.\\" And boasts, among other charms: \\" Lo here is a belle to hange upon your hogge, and save your cattel from the bytynge of a dogge\\". Walter Thornbury's description Walter Thornbury in his Old and New London (1872), wrote as follows:Walter Thornbury, Old and New London, vol.1, London, 1872, p.531 :\\"St. Benedict's,\\" says Maitland,William Maitland (c.1693‚Äì1757), historian and topographer, author of History of London from Its Foundation to the Present Time \\"is vulgarly Bennet Fink. Though this church is at present a donative, it was anciently a rectory, in the gift of the noble family of Nevil, who probably conferred the name upon the neighbouring hospital of St. Anthony.\\" Newcourt (died 1716), who lived near St. Benet Fink, says the monks of the Order of St. Anthony hard by were so importunate in their requests for alms that they would threaten those who refused them with St. Anthony's fire and that timid people were in the habit of presenting them with fat pigs, in order to retain their good-will. Their pigs thus became numerous, and, as they were allowed to roam about for food, led to the proverb, \\"He will follow you like a St. Anthony's pig.\\" Stow accounts for the number of these pigs in another way, by saying that when pigs were seized in the markets by the City officers, as ill-fed or unwholesome, the monks took possession of them, and tying a bell about their neck, allowed them to stroll about on the dunghills, until they became fit for food, when they were claimed for the convent\\".

Facts Mactrac Ltd was a company carrying on the business of builders and civil engineers. Mactrac Ltd was the beneficial owner of 100% of the issued share capital in C&K; (Construction) Ltd. On 3 March 1962 a receiver was appointed with respect to Mactrac Ltd by a debenture holder. Accounts would later show that at this time the company had a deficiency of assets against liabilities in the total sum of ¬£389,977. On 21 May 1962 a petition of the compulsory winding-up of Mactrac Ltd was presented, and an order to that effect was made on 4 June 1962. On 18 January 1963 the receiver (with the approval of the liquidator) sold all of the assets and undertaking of Mactrac Ltd to its wholly owned subsidiary, C&K; (Construction) Ltd. On that date the unrelieved tax losses incurred Mactrac Ltd in its trade were ¬£326,486 and it had a further ¬£82,025 in unrelieved capital allowances. The receiver then sold the entire share capital of C&K; (Construction) Ltd. to an outside purchaser. When the appellant company was assessed for tax, it claimed to be able to set-off the unrelieved losses and capital allowances of Mactrac under section 17 of the Finance Act 1954. The central question in relation to the claim for tax relief was whether trade was \\"carried on\\" up until the date of the sale. Accordingly, for the purposes of the relevant analysis the only real question in the appeal was whether a company in liquidation (Mactrac Ltd) remained the beneficial owner of its assets. Judgment The sole judgment of the House of Lords was given by Lord Diplock. His short judgment started by encapsulating the issue: His Lordship then reviewed the relief provisions in the Finance Act before turning to the effect of a winding-up order, holding that the principal effects of the statutory regime were that:Ayerst, at 177A-D. # the custody and control of all the company's property are transferred to the liquidation (under section 243); # the duty of the liquidator is to collect all of the assets and apply them in discharge of its liabilities (section 257(1)); and # all powers of dealing with the company's assets are exercisable by the liquidator for the benefit of those persons only who are entitled to share in the proceeds of realisation of the assets under the statutory scheme. The company itself can never be entitled to any part of those proceeds, and after the completion of the winding-up it is dissolved (section 274). The court noted that unlike the bankruptcy of a person, the winding-up of a company does not transfer legal title to the company's property to the liquidator. They referred to the comments of Lord Cairns in the decision of In re Albert Life Assurance Co., The Delhi Bank's caseIn re Albert Life Assurance Co., The Delhi Bank's case (1871) 15 SJ 923 at 924. where he had held that upon winding-up the assets of a company become impressed by a trust, and the decision of the Court of Appeal in In re Oriental Inland Steam Co,In re Oriental Inland Steam Co (1874) 9 Ch App 557. and in particular the comment of Mellish LJ that \\"[i]t appears to me that that does, in strictness, constitute a trust for the benefit of all creditors\\".In re Oriental Inland Steam Co, at 560. Lord Diplock noted that the editors of Buckley on the Companies Acts had treated that statement as authoritative from 1897 to the present time, and that Lord Diplock was content that this was correct. His Lordship then considered arguments by the appellants that Parliament may have intended something different when they used the term \\"beneficial ownership\\" in the Finance Act, which he also dismissed. Commentary Although the decision has never subsequently been doubted, commentators were quick to point out that \\"trust\\" is not used in the strictly technical term, as none of the creditors have any specific interest in the trust property. Other commentators have noted that \\"[i]t has long been objected that there is no real trust of the property of a company in liquidation and 'trust' should be used only as a convenient way of describing the status of property in a liquidation, not as a categorisation with legal consequences\\". Subsequent cases have held that neither the company nor any other person has a beneficial interest in the assets of a company in liquidation., per Lord Hoffman at [28].

The pier is located at Heather Road and Boardwalk. The Wildwood Crest Fishing Club owned and operated the pier for more than 85 years. In 2006, ownership was transferred to the Borough of Wildwood Crest. Renovations Due to the outward sweeping shape of the island, the beaches of Wildwood Crest accumulate massive amounts of sand from the northern barrier islands. Consequently, the beaches of Wildwood Crest grow about 20 feet in width each year. Since the construction of the pier, the beach has grown increasingly longer. The pier has been lengthened two separate times in order to extend its platform into the sea. In 2008, the aging pier was renovated and made handicapped accessible. The borough paid $670,000 for the renovations and the state Department of Community Affairs provided a $400,000 grant. In 2014, the unused and dilapidated fishing clubhouse, which was as covered in asbestos and hazardous materials, was demolished and replaced with a wooden deck that includes several picnic tables.

Darwin was major figure in the Women's suffrage movement in Iowa in the late 19th century. with She and her husband, Charles Ben Darwin, resided together in Burlington from 1851 until he left for Washington state in 1870. They later divorced. That same year Mary Darwin chaired the first meeting of the executive committee of the Iowa Woman's Suffrage Association. She became a popular speaker on the subject throughout the state, but she was eventually shut out of the statewide movement because of her more liberal attitudes on such topics as free love. After living in Washington, D.C. from 1876 to 1880 she returned to Burlington and became involved with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union on both the local and state levels.

The base order is for 400 cars and will be used to replace the 2600-series cars, dating back to the 1980s, which are currently assigned to the Blue, Brown, and Orange Lines. If the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) ordered the additional 446 cars, these cars would replace the 3200-series cars, dating back to the early 1990s, which are currently assigned to the Blue and Brown Lines. Including all options, which is a total of 846 cars, the order will cost $1.3 billion. The contract requires ten prototypes to be delivered by October 2019. If the rail cars prove to be acceptable, then full production cars would be delivered starting in October 2020, at a rate of 10 cars per month. The cost per car is approximately $1.58 million. Prototypes for testing to be delivered in August 2020 and then the base order to be delivered by 2024. According to the CTA, when the 7000-series cars enter service, the Chicago \\"L\\" will have one of the youngest fleets of any U.S. transit system, with its fleet being an average of 13 years old. For comparison, the average age of rapid transit trains will be 27 years for Boston, 25 years for the District of Columbia, 22 years for New York City, and 18 years for San Francisco.  Features  Each 7000-series rail car will feature 37 to 38 seats, and is a hybrid of the 3200-series and 5000-series. The 5000-series train cars are equipped with AC propulsion; interior security cameras, interior readouts, interior maps GPS, glow-in-the-dark evacuation signs, operator-controlled ventilation systems. AC propulsion allows for smoother acceleration, lower operational costs, less wear and tear, and greater energy efficiency. In particular, AC propulsion can take advantage of regenerative braking, meaning the train returns excess energy to the third rail as it slows down.5000-series Cars (2009). Chicago-L.org. Accessed January 28, 2019. LED screens give real-time transit information to passengers. LCD screens, installed near the doors, display real-time surveillance footage of riders in order to deter crime. In the 7000-series, the design and arrangement of seats were modified to improve ergonomics and increase leg room. In addition, because the seats are attached to the side of the train using a diagonal pole rather than a vertical one to the floor, cleaning the train will be easier. However, seats will still be a combination of fabric and plastic. Compared to the 5000-series, there will be more front and back-facing seats. Enhanced air conditioning will circulate air more efficiently during hot summer days. Laser sensors above the doors will count the number of passengers, allowing the CTA to track passenger volumes and change its schedules accordingly.  Contracting and production  On February 20, 2016, two finalists were announced for the contract--Canada's Bombardier Transportation and China's CRRC Sifang America. Bombardier was the manufacturer of the previous 5000-series cars. On March 9, 2016, the contract was awarded to CRRC Sifang America, with a bid that is $226 million lower than Bombardier's. However, on April 11, 2016, Bombardier filed a protest of the award, alleging that CTA rigged the procurement to give CRRC an unfair advantage. On September 28, 2016, the CTA finalized its decision to make CRRC Sifang America the manufacturer of the 7000-series cars. The cars are being built at a new CRRC Sifang America rail car manufacturing plant at 13535 South Torrence Avenue in Chicago's Hegewisch neighborhood. Construction of the factory began in March 2017, with production to start at the factory in March 2019. CRRC invested $100 million on constructing the plant and $7.2 million on training its workforce of about 170 people. This is the first time in more than 50 years CTA rail cars are manufactured in Chicago. In June 2019, production began on the 7000-series cars. The rail cars will be manufactured over a period of more than 10 years. CRRC said it planned to use its Chicago factory to produce rapid transit rail cars for San Francisco and bi-level coach cars for Metra, a commuter rail operator serving Chicago metropolitan area, if it won contracts for these. As of August 2019, because CRRC was the only bidder, Metra once again asked competitors to present their proposals. CRRC has also placed bids for to produce rail cars for the Long Island Rail Road in New York and the Washington Metro. Beneath the train, there were 8,000 wires that need to be individually connected. The contract required a test set to be delivered by October 2019. If the rail cars proved to be acceptable, then full production cars would be delivered starting in October 2020, at a rate of 10 cars per month. In December 2019, a set was seen testing at the facility. Prototypes for testing would be delivered in August 2020 and then the base order would be delivered by 2024. In August 2020, a set, possibly a different one from the one previously mentioned, of 7000-series arrived in Skokie Shops by semi truck. In October 2020, The 7000-series cars began testing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtu1KyuGr1s&t;=243s CRRC controversy By law, 69% of each rail car must be US-sourced. Car shells are manufactured in China, transported by ships to Los Angeles or Houston, and then by trucks to Chicago to be completed at the CRRC Sifang America plant. Concerns have been raised over possible malware, cyber attacks, and mass surveillance by the Chinese government. However, the computer and software components and the automatic train control system will be made by American and Canadian firms.China's takeover of U.S. rail car construction, including for the CTA, raises security concerns. Chicago Tribune. January 8, 2019. Accessed January 27, 2019. Of the 24 suppliers to the project, 19 have business headquarters in the U.S., and 16 of which have previously done business with the CTA. Moreover, the CTA reserves to right to supervise production and to halt the process if it sees fit. There will be no payments till the cars are received. Late deliveries will result in a fine of $300 per car per day. Although CRRC has also been producing rapid transit trains for Boston, CTA Vice President for Purchasing Ellen McCormick said she was unsuccessful in obtaining information on the rail cars delivered to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In mid-2019, the United States Congress considered banning federal dollars from being spent on Chinese buses and trains due to concerns about unfair competition from state-sponsored firms, sabotage, and espionage. This is not part of a stand-alone bill but is rather a defense policy bill passed the House of Representatives. The Senate was considering the same proposal. This measure has bipartisan support. It would prevent the company from taking further orders in the American market, but would not affect CRRC's current contract with the CTA.

The burial was uncovered in an archaeological dig in 1987. Contents Kirkburn Sword in the British Museum The grave contained the skeleton of a man in his late 20s to early 30s. He was placed in the grave in a crouched position with his knees pulled towards his chest. A sword and scabbard were positioned behind his back. As part of the burial rite the remains of a pig were placed on his chest. As a final act before the grave was filled in, three spears were thrust into the man‚Äôs chest. This burial rite has been recorded in other graves from East Yorkshire (such as the Wetwang Slack burials) and was part of the ceremonies associated with burial. The ornate iron sword, described by the British Museum as \\"probably the finest Iron Age sword in Europe\\" was around 69 centimetres long. The scabbard was constructed in two sections, a front plate of decorated copper alloy, and a rear plate of iron. The iron pommel of the sword was decorated with fine red glass beads, and the two handle sections, pommel and handle guard were attached with rivets. The handle guard was made of horn, and the handle itself is an iron tube decorated with glass enamelling. Also found 11 meters away was a chariot burial containing a mail shirt, a rare find in Iron Age Britain. The mail shirt was of butted construction, with two mail shoulder flaps attached to a bronze central clasp.

Design In the 1930s there was considerable interest in extending the speed range of aircraft. Slower level flight requires either larger area wings or airfoils with higher lift coefficients, the latter achieved either with higher angles of attack or greater camber. Combinations of these approaches could be used, as by modern camber and area increasing multipart flaps. The Makhonine Mak-10 was a 1931 example of pure area increase by wing extension but the 1932 Schmeidler SN.2 increased both area and camber with chord extension. It was designed and built by Werner Schmeidler and Neumann, both at the Breslau Technical College, now the Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology. It was the second aircraft with area increasing wings built by them, hence the SN.2 designation, though this is not used in any of the pre-war journals cited here; nothing is known of its predecessor. Apart from its variable wing trailing edge, the SN.2 was a conventional, single engine cantilever high wing monoplane. The straight leading edge of its wing was swept to semi-elliptical tips and the unextended trailing edge was also straight but without sweep. It had unusually short and broad slotted ailerons which reached behind the trailing edge. The fixed part of the wing had the popular, thick (15%) flat-bottomed G√∂ttingen 387 airfoil with room within it for the extension, which had a right angle triangular plan and circular arc profile. When retracted, its rear edge protruded slightly out of the slot in the trailing edge of the fixed section. At its root, which was supported in a groove in the narrow, central upper fuselage, it increased the chord by about 35%; overall it added 20% to the wing area and increased the camber. It was controlled with a ratchet-restrained lever in the cockpit which was linked to fuselage mounted gears that engaged with racks on the moving surfaces. The SN.2 was powered by a BMW X five cylinder radial engine mounted with its cylinder heads projecting through a domed cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided with the pilot under the wing leading edge in an enclosed single seat cabin. Aft, the central, wing bearing section behind the fixed wing trailing edge dropped away to a five sided structure with a ridged upper surface. At the rear the empennage was conventional, with a roughly semi-circular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, a little ahead of a similarly shaped fin. Both fixed surfaces carried broad, unbalanced control surfaces, with the rudder, which extended to the keel, operating within an elevator cut-out. Its landing gear was of the fixed, conventional tailwheel type. Each mainwheel was mounted on a faired-in pair of V-strut pairs with a tall, inward leaning shock absorber strut from the axle to the wing root. Later on this was replaced by a vertical shock absorber strut to the wing underside. At the rear the tailskid was vertically sprung. Flown by Wolf Hirth, the SN.2 flew for the first time on 12 January 1932 from Breslau. By March tests showed that opening the wing fully shortened take-off distance by a factor of two. In May it flew to Berlin where it was demonstrated in flight at Tempelhof. It was on static display at the DELA exhibition of sports aircraft held in Berlin for most of October 1932, registered as D-2257. It remained in action until at least 1934, when it moved to the new, all letter, civil registration scheme as D-YRON.

About 30% of homes are owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% are owner-occupied on a mortgage. About 18% are social housing of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented. The UK ranks in the top half of EU countries with regard to rooms per person, amenities, and quality of housing. However, the cost of housing as a proportion of income is higher than average among EU countries, and the increasing cost of housing in the UK may constitute a housing crisis for some, especially for those in low income brackets or in high-cost areas such as London.  History  Victorian era Rapid population growth took place in the nineteenth century, particularly in cities. The new homes were arranged and funded via building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms.H.J. Dyos, \\"The speculative builders and developers of Victorian London.\\" Victorian Studies 11 (1968): 641‚Äì690. in JSTORChristopher Powell, The British building industry since 1800: An economic history (Taylor & Francis, 1996). Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults.H.J. Dyos, \\"The Slums of Victorian London.\\" Victorian Studies 11.1 (1967): 5-40. in JSTORAnthony S. Wohl, The eternal slum: housing and social policy in Victorian London (1977).Martin J. Daunton, House and home in the Victorian city: working class housing, 1850-1914 (1983). 1900‚Äì1939 The rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, 1919‚Äì1939, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where the construction of new housing practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock in England and Wales was 7,600,000 in 1911; 8,000,000 in 1921; 9,400,000 in 1931; and 11,300,000 in 1939. Renting during 1900‚Äì1939 The private rent market provided 90% of the housing before the war. Now it came under heavy pressure, regarding rent controls, and the inability of owners to evict tenants, except for non-payment of rent. The tenants had a friend in Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, and especially in the increasingly powerful Labour Party. The private rent sector went into a prolonged decline and never recovered; by 1938, it covered only 58% of the housing stock.Martin Pugh, We Danced All Night: A Social History of Britain Between the Wars (2009), p 60 Becontree housing estate built in the 1920s in London suburbs A decisive change in policy was marked by the Tudor Walters Report of 1918; it set the standards for council house design and location for the next ninety years.Burnett, A social history of housing: 1815-1985 (1986) pp 226‚Äì34.John Stephenson, British society 1914 ‚Äì 45 (1984) pp 221-42. It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at at a density of twelve to the acre.John Burnett, A Social History of Housing : 1815-1985 (2nd ed. 1986) pp 222-26. With the Housing, Town Planning, &c.; Act 1919 David Lloyd George set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 election campaign promises of \\"homes fit for heroes.\\" It required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidised the low rents. The immediate impact was the prevalence of the three-bedroom house, with kitchen, bathroom, parlour, electric lighting, and gas cooking, often built as subsidised council housing. Major cities such as London and Birmingham built large-scale housing estates ‚Äì one in Birmingham had a population of 30,000 residents. The houses were built in blocks of two or four using brick or stucco, with two storeys. They were set back from curving streets; each had a long garden. Shopping centres, churches and pubs sprang up nearby. Eventually, the city would provide a community hall, schools, and a public library. The residents typically were the upper fifth stratum of the working-class. The largest of these two communities was Becontree in the outer suburbs of London, where construction began in 1921, and by 1932 there were 22,000 houses holding 103,000 residents.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars 1918-1940 (1955) pp 229-30. Slum clearance now moved from being a public health issue, to a matter of town planning.Paul Wilding, \\"The Housing and Town Planning Act 1919‚ÄîA Study in the Making of Social Policy.\\" Journal of Social Policy 2#4 (1973): 317-334. Liberal MP Tudor Walters was inspired by the garden city movement, calling for spacious low-density developments and semi-detached houses built to a high construction standard. Older women could now vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundromats, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured yards. The housewives had had their fill of chamber pots.Pugh, We Danced All Night (2009), p 61.Noreen Branson, Britain in the Nineteen Twenties (1976) pp 103-17. Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural Norfolk. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the unaffordability of rents by the rural poor.Annette Martin, \\"Shattered hopes and unfulfilled dreams: council housing in neural Norfolk in the early 1920s, Local Historian (2005) 35#2 pp 107-119. In England and Wales, 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; making the Ministry of Health largely a ministry of housing.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the Wars: 1918‚Äì1940 (1955) pp 43‚Äì46 Council housing accounted for 10% of the housing stock in the UK by 1938, peaking at 32% in 1980, and dropping to 18% by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades.Pat Thane, Cassel's Companion to 20th Century Britain 2001) 195-96.Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, Interwar Britain: A social and economic history (1976) pp 212-44.Noreen Branson and Margot Heinemann, Britain in the Nineteen Thirties (1971) pp 180 ‚Äì 201.Martin Pugh, We Danced all Night: A social history of Britain between the Wars (2008), pp 57-75 Debates on high-rise housing The fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s in London. On the political left there was firm opposition to what were denounced as \\"barracks for the working-classes\\". Reformers on the right called for multi-storey solutions to overcrowding and high rents. There were attempts at compromise by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney they included John Scurr House (built 1936‚Äì1937), Riverside Mansions (1925‚Äì1928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).Simon Pepper and Peter Richmond, \\"Stepney and the Politics of High-Rise Housing: Limehouse Fields to John Scurr House, 1925‚Äì1937.\\" London Journal 34.1 (2009): 33-54. Ownership Increasingly the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent of people owning their own home before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996. The construction industry sold the idea of home ownership to upscale renters. The mortgage lost its old stigma of a millstone round your neck to instead be seen as a smart long-term investment in suburbanized Britain. It appealed to aspirations of upward mobility and made possible the fastest rate of growth in working-class owner-occupation during the 20th century.Peter Scott, \\"Marketing mass home ownership and the creation of the modern working-class consumer in inter-war Britain.\\" Business History 50#1 (2008): 4-25. Mark Swenarton and Sandra Taylor. \\"The scale and nature of the growth of owner‚Äêoccupation in Britain between the wars.\\" Economic History Review 38#3 (1985): 373-392. The boom was largely financed by the savings ordinary Britons put into their building societies. Starting in the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalization of mortgage terms.Jane Humphries, \\"Inter-war house building, cheap money and building societies: The housing boom revisited.\\" Business History 29.3 (1987): 325-345. Post War left Vote Conservative for more houses Housing was a critical shortage in the post-war era. Air raids had destroyed half a million housing units; repairs and maintenance on undamaged homes had been postponed. 3,000,000 new dwellings were needed. The government aimed for 300,000 to be built annually, compared to the maximum pre-war rate of 350,000. However, there were shortages of builders, materials, and funding. The Ministry of Works undertook the publication of a set of Post War Building Studies, that established technical guidelines for the use of new or modernised building materials. Not counting 150,000 temporary prefabricated units, the nation was still 1,500,000 units short by 1951. Legislation kept rents down, but did not affect purchased houses. The ambitions of the New Towns Act 1946 project were idealistic, but did not provide enough urgently needed units. When the Conservative Party returned to power in 1951, they made housing a high priority and oversaw 2,500,000 new units, two-thirds of them through local councils. Haste made for dubious quality, and policy increasingly shifted toward renovation rather than new builds. Slums were cleared, opening the way for gentrification in the inner cities.Burnett, A social history of housing: 1815-1985 (1985) pp 278-330 Working-class families proved eager to purchase their council homes when the Thatcher ministry introduced the \\"Right to Buy\\" scheme in 1980, alongside restricting the construction of new council houses.Norman Ginsburg, \\"The privatization of council housing.\\" Critical Social Policy 25.1 (2005): 115-135. Permanent dwellings completed in England by tenure type According to a 2018 study in the Economic History Review, the ‚Äòstop-go‚Äô macroeconomic policy framework adopted by the Treasury and the Bank of England from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s restricted house-building during the period. The National Audit Office maintains 200,000 starter homes promised in 2015 have not been built. Meg Hillier MP said, ‚ÄúDespite setting aside over ¬£2bn to build 60,000 new starter homes, none were built. Since 2010 many housing programmes announced with much fanfare have fallen away, with money then recycled into the next announcement. The department needs to focus on delivery and not raise, and then dash, people‚Äôs expectations.‚ÄùTories fail to build any of 200,000 starter homes promised in 2015, says watchdog The Guardian  Demography  There are approximately 23 million dwellings in England. In 2009, about 30% of homes were owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% were owner-occupied on a mortgage. About 18% are social housing of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented. The overall mean number of bedrooms is approximately 2.8. Just under 40% of households have at least two spare bedrooms. 20% of dwellings were built before 1919 and 15% were built post 1990. 29% of all dwellings are terraced, 42% are detached or semi- detached, and the remaining 29% are bungalows or flats. The mean floor area is 95 square metres. Approximately 4% of all dwellings were vacant. Approximately 385,000 households reported a fire between 2012 and 2014, the majority of which were caused by cooking. In 2014 2.6 million households moved dwelling, the majority of which (74%) were renters. The National Housing Federation estimate that 8.4 million people in England live in unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable homes. Heriot-Watt University did research suggesting one in eight people in England are now adversely affected by fast-rising prices and missed house-building targets.Housing crisis affects estimated 8.4 million in England - research BBC More than 8 million people in England living in unsuitable housing The Guardian  Government policy  Housing is currently the responsibility of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The current Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government is Robert Jenrick.  Supply and construction  Housing starts in England 1969-2016 The Labour government suspected that there might be supply-side problems in the construction sector, and in 2006 commissioned the Callcutt Review of House Building Delivery, which was published in 2007. The Callcutt report noted the failure of the home building industry to increase the supply in response to price signals. There was a fall in the numbers of house completions after the 2008 recession, but by 2015 it was back up to 169,000. According to the Centre for Ageing Better 21% of homes in the UK were built before 1919, 38% before 1946, and only 7% after 2000, making the UK housing stock the oldest in the European Union. Local planning authorities are required to continuously maintain sufficient land to meet housing needs for five years.Gov.UK https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-supply-and- delivery#year-housing-land-supply It is estimated 250,000 new homes are needed each year just to keep up with the demand of the UK's continually growing population.Westville Group https://www.westvillegroup.co.uk/commercial- industries-new-build-housing/  Purchase price of a dwelling  UK housing affordability in terms of take home pay Value of land and buildings in the UK from 1995 to 2016. After adjusting for inflation, the average cost of a home increased by a factor of 3.4 between 1950 and 2012. In September 2015 the average house price was ¬£286,000, and affordability of housing as measured by price to earnings ratio was 5.3. UK home dwelling cost per type in July 2018 was on average: *Detached ¬£378,473 *Semi-detached ¬£230,284 *Terraced ¬£200,889 *Flat/maisonette ¬£230,603.  The London effect  There is concern that councils in central London are aggravating the housing crises by pursuing policies of gentrification. London is ranked as the top city in the world in terms of the number of ultra high net worth individuals who are resident in a city. The consequence of this is seen in the high price for top-end dwellings. The most expensive home ever sold in the UK was 2‚Äì8a Rutland Gate, Hyde Park, which sold for ¬£280 million in 2015. The most expensive street in the UK is Kensington Palace Gardens, London, where the average price of a home is approximately ¬£42 million. A report for Wandsworth Borough Council found that overseas investors had a positive effect on housing affordability, both in bringing forward new homes in general and allowing the affordable housing part of schemes to be brought forward more quickly. They also found that there was very little evidence of housing being left empty. See below for further information on claims that London properties are being kept empty by speculators.  Desirability of rising house prices Dwellings represent the largest non-financial asset in the UK balance sheet, with a net worth of ¬£5.1 trillion (2014). In the national statistics rising house prices are regarded as adding to GDP and thus a cause of economic growth. Historically, the assumption in the media and elsewhere was that rising house prices were a good thing. There is evidence that the public no longer share this view.  Renting  Nearly two out of five households rent their home. However, the supply of rental properties has been declining since 2016 when the taxation treatment of rental property turned against landlords. https://www.ft.com/content/33c6e7b4-3927-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0 Nearly all dwellings are let using Assured shorthold tenancy agreements. For the initial period, typically six months or a year, neither side can terminate the agreement. After this period, landlords can terminate the agreement at two months' notice. Council Tax is paid by the occupier of the home unless it is a House in multiple occupation (HMO) when the landlord is liable. High rents have not just affected those in the lower half of the income distribution; who have always been lifelong renters. In the era of the Keynes‚ÄìBeveridge consensus those in the upper half of the income distribution would typically rent a home while saving for a deposit to get onto the property ladder. This is no longer possible; money which would have been used in saving for a deposit now goes on rent. The majority of new households formed in the UK can now expect to rent from a private landlord for life. This phenomenon has been called generation rent and there is much debate about the social consequences of this change. See inequality for further information. In London, rents are double the national average and this is driving gentrification. Londoners on median earnings find they can no longer afford to rent a flat in central London. Those on median incomes who work in central London have had to move to the outer suburbs of London and the commuting towns of SE England. Many find that commuting using London's congested transport infrastructure lowers their standard of living and is disruptive to family life. According to a report by the Centre for Housing Policy at the University of York, a quarter of a million families with babies and young children in England live in privately rented housing that does not meet the decent homes standard.Study reveals rise in children raised in squalid rental homes The Guardian Research by Loughborough University, funded by Trust for Londonhttps://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/publications/minimum-income-standard- london-2018/, showed that achieving a decent standard of living costs 60% more in inner London for a single working age adult than it would in the rest of the UK. The research found that rental costs were a major contributing factor to higher living costs in London. Average rents for a single working age adult living alone in inner London increased between 2014-18 by 14.8%. Rents in outer London increased by 19.4% over the same period. Rent for student accommodation in 2019 is higher than the maintenance loan in London and a high proportion of the maintenance loan outside London. There are calls for more affordable student housing to be built.Spiralling rents consume increasing portion of student loans The Guardian The benefit freeze has prevented housing benefit covering the whole cost of renting for the poorest tenants. In a survey by Shelter 40% of private renters said they had reduced clothes buying, 37% had used benefits meant for living costs to pay rent, more than a third had reduced spending on food, 28% had reduced heating, and a third had sold possessions. The housing benefit freeze may continue after other benefits are unfrozen. Polly Neate of Shelter said, ‚ÄúThe freeze on housing benefit is pushing families into poverty and homelessness. People are being forced into desperate measures to pay their rent from selling their possessions and borrowing money to skipping meals. Politicians kicking [the housing benefit freeze decision] into the long grass means too many families will struggle through the winter, weighing up whether to pay their heating bill or their rent.‚ÄùBenefit-rent gap for poorest tenants widens to ¬£113 a month The Guardian  Homelessness  In June 2015 there were approximately 67,000 households in England in temporary accommodation. In autumn 2014 there were around 2,400 rough sleepers in England, 27% of which were in London. In 2018, around 320,000 people were homeless in the United Kingdom, both adults and children.  Overcrowding  The consequence of the housing shortage and high rents manifests itself in overcrowding rather than In homelessness, The problem of over crowding is especially acute in London. In 2011 it was estimated that there were 391,000 children in London living in overcrowded conditions. Between 1995-1996 to 2013-2014 overcrowding, as measured by the bedroom standard increased from 63,000 households to 218,000 households. The bedroom standard understates overcrowding. It does not include potential household units forced to live in the same dwelling. For example, divorced couples living in the same dwelling, adult children being unable to form own household but having to live with their parents. It has not proved possible to find statistics on the true extent of overcrowding. A report issued by the Deputy Prime Minister's Office reviewed the evidence that overcrowding, in addition to the known impacts on physical health, adversely affects mental health and child development.  Housing quality  It is useful to consider housing quality under two sub headings physical and social. In the era of Beveridge Consensus there were large scale slum clearance projects. Council environmental health officers inspected dwellings in a borough and those which failed to meet standards were compulsorily purchased for a nominal sum and demolished. New dwellings were built to rehouse the slum dwellers. Slum clearance significantly improved the physical quality of the UK housing stock. But in a seminal study Family and Kinship in East London it was found that although the physical quality of the housing had improved, its social quality had deteriorated. The residents of apartments in tower blocks appreciated their clean, warm, bright new apartments, but missed the supportive community networks of the slums.  Physical quality  Undocumented migrants, as they fear being deported, are easily exploited, and do not report housing conditions which constitute a public health risk. This means that the extent of the problem is not known. Although overall the quality of English housing stock has improved over the last thirty years (a generation), the quality of housing for new households formed from those at or below the median income has declined. Thirty years ago a new household in this group could rent a council house built to Parker Morris standard. In 2016, a new household from this group, has to rent from a private landlord a dwelling, which will have less space than the Parker Morris standard dwelling, and likely to be damp, and they pay in real terms, at least three time the rent of their parent's generation. Jessica McLean was a tenant who complained about a dwelling and claimed that she was evicted due to this.  Social quality  For many people the social life their home enables is as important as the physical conditions the home provides. There is a debate about whether the generation born in the 1980s are better or worse off than their parents. Some economists claim living standards have improved for what has been called generation X, whilst others hold they have declined. The economist point to fourfold growth in the nation's GDP, an increase GDP per capita, and an increase median earnings. Those who content that there has been a fall living standards for generation X, say that increasing GDP per capita can be, and is in the UK, associated with a declining quality of life. And that housing conditions of Generation X has made their standard of living far lower than that of their parents. They claim that the two major cause of decline in the social environment provided by housing are: symmetrical tenancy agreements and socially segregated housing developments.  Socially segregated housing  Typical multistory block gated development. 2015 price for 2 bed apartment ¬£380,000. The current position is that in London, only UK citizens who are top earners, are in the market to become home owners. In London, many apartments are marketed to, and bought by, foreign investors. The ideal unit for such investors, is in a gated development with a tower block of apartments, with car parking instead of gardens. There is some evidence that gated developments improve security for residents, but perversely may increase the fear of crime. The residents of the gated development become fearful of those living outside of their secured space and only leave the development by car. They are too fearful to walk out of it and socialize with their neighbours outside. Semidetached council houses. 3 Beds, front/back garden. built 1950s, cost to council ¬£(2012) 55,000 . Some commentators believe that where there is limited social interaction between owner occupiers and council tenants there is much scope for misunderstanding.  Cost of home heating (energy efficiency)  UK homes are some of the most expensive to heat in Europe, which results in high levels of fuel poverty (for further information see Fuel poverty in the United Kingdom). The problem results from age of the housing stock with most dwellings being built prior to oil shock of 1973, after which insulation standards for newly build housing improved. The UK dwellings have the oldest age profile in the EU with over 60% being built before 1960, and with only just over 10% being built between 1991-2010. The graph above on the history of construction of new dwellings shows this age profile is a consequence of the reduction in the number of in new dwellings build per year after 1979. There is a particular problem with dwellings built before World War I (1914-1918), which are now over hundred years old. The terraced houses of this period, built for sale to the buy-to-let investors of the time, are particular difficult to insulate. These dwellings were built for heating by open coal fires, and had large drafty windows to allow the fire to draw. They have very small rooms and have solid walls with a single leaf of bricks. This structure makes wall insulation expensive and in many cases impractical. Many of the dwellings of this type were replaced by council houses in the post war slum clearance program, but with the ending of public sector building of dwellings this route for improving the energy efficient of the housing stock ended. There also insulation problems in the pre-1914 large houses built for the top decile of the time. These houses were built with servant quarters in the roof space. Most such houses have been converted into blocks of flats and sold to buy to let investors. These flats are difficult to insulate, especial the top floor flat in the roof space. The expense of insulation means that it is not often not cost effective for the landlord to insulate such dwellings. This is especially true in London, where due to the housing crisis, landlords can let a property in poor condition, and consequently improving the energy efficiency of a dwelling is not a priority for buy to let investors. There is also a problem in that only half the poorly insulated dwelling in the private rental sector use central heating, instead using more expensive electrical heaters.  Government policies for improving home energy efficiency  To encourage home insulation the governments introduced The Green Deal, the Energy Company Obligation, and Energy Performance Certificates(EPCs). The Green Deal does not offer any subsidies or grants for home insulation. Instead a new type of loan is provided which is attached to the property rather than the individual who takes out the loan. The purchaser of property becomes liable for the loan taken out to insulate the property. The Green Deal policy has met substantial criticism. In 2013, the Telegraph wrote that the high rate of interest charged for loans taken out under the Green Deal will mean there will be insignificant take-up, and hence the policy will be ineffective. The energy company obligation provides means- tested grants for home insulation. The funding for these grants does not come from government taxation. Instead there is legislation that allows the energy utilities to raise a levy on all utility bills to pay for the means-tested insulation grants. In 2015 these charges added about ¬£112 to the average utility bill. If the utility fails to spend the money it raises from the levies in insulating the homes of those in fuel poverty, it is fined. There have been problems with the scheme; utilities have been paying fines rather than providing the insulation. The difficulties the utilities have had are in the low uptake of the grants. There is a particular problem in that most of the people in fuel poverty who are entitled to the grants are in the private rental sector. A tenant who applies for and gets a grant which improves his landlord's property has no security of tenure. The tenant will not benefit from reduced fuel bills, if the landlord puts up the rent, as the property has been improved. Understandably, tenants in fuel poverty have been reluctant to apply for the grants. The consequence of failure to take up grants is given as one of the reasons the UK is missing carbon reduction targets. UK Home Performance Rating Chart The idea behind EPCs was that if those buying or renting a property are informed about its energy efficiency market forces will lead to better insulated dwellings. To improve the working of the market by providing better informed purchasers, under UK law, whenever a dwelling is built, sold, or rented an EPC is required. An EPC gives an indication of the energy efficiency of a dwelling. The certificates have been criticized as they are based on visual inspection of the property, and examination of documents, and not on measurements of energy use, or the insulation characteristic of the building. It is not possible to calculate the cost of heating a dwelling from its EPC, or the amount of energy which can be saved by insulating a wall, roof or window. There are claims that EPCs are of no real value. It is held that a certificate which can be bought for just ¬£34, produced as result of form filling exercise, can not possibility be as useful as a proper energy survey based on measurement. There have been improvements housing in insulation but this is mainly in the owner-occupier sector. Between 2001 and 2013 the prevalence of cavity wall insulation of houses which have cavity walls rose from 39% to 68%. Over the same period the proportion of fully double-glazed dwellings rose from 51% to 80%. It has not proved possible to find evidence that these improvements were the result of government policy or would have happened anyway. If all the recommendations by energy performance certificates were implemented the notional carbon dioxide emissions from UK dwellings could be reduced by over 20%. Empty homes Number of dwellings in England that have been empty for more than six months (2003‚Äì2016) Percentage of unoccupied dwellings (including those used only seasonally) in Europe by country, showing the UK has relatively low unoccupancy According to official statistics, in October 2015, there were 600,179 vacant dwellings in England, a decline from the 610,123 from a year earlier. Of these vacant dwellings, 203,596 were vacant for more than six months. This, it is believed, is mainly due to financial reasons, such as the owner being unable to sell the house or raise enough money to renovate the property. In November 2017, the government allowed councils to charge a 100% council tax premium on empty homes. According to official statistics, the percentage of empty homes in England fell from 3.5% in 2008 to 2.6% in 2014. One explanation for this housing transactions have picked up since the financial crisis, and because of government efforts to reduce the number of empty homes. An alternative explanation is that before April 2013 there was an incentive for property owners to report a property as empty, as there was a rebate on council tax for vacant property. And when this incentive was removed, property owners ceased informing the council that their property was empty, and this led to an apparent fall in empty homes reported by official statistics. The number of empty homes includes homes where the previous occupier is in prison, in care, in hospital or recently deceased. The charity Empty Homes argued that empty homes were helping contribute to the housing crisis, saying in a report \\"The longer a property is empty the more our housing assets are being wasted. Also, the longer a property lies empty, the more likely it is to deteriorate; the more it is likely to cost to bring back into use; and the more it is likely to be seen as a blight by the neighbours.\\" Long-term empty homes In 2016, there were around 200,000 empty homes in the UK, down from 300,000 in 2010. Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EMDOs) allow councils to take over the management of long-term empty properties but these are generally seen as a last resort and only 43 EDMOs were successful from 2006 to 2011. Government statistics show that long-term empty homes are generally concentrated post- industrial areas, in the North of England and in seaside towns, where property prices are generally lower, with the lowest percentage in London, which had 20,795 long-term empty properties, with the highest in Barrow-in Furness, Burley and Blackburn. London As of 2015, around 1.7% of homes in London are empty, which is a historically low level. The vacancy rate is much lower for London's private sector housing compared to the rest of the country, whereas the rates for affordable housing are \\"broadly similar\\". Research by Islington Council revealed that nearly a third of new dwellings built did not have anyone on the electoral register after six years, although this may exclude students and foreign tenants. The Observer reported on what has been termed 'lights out London' .. 'where absentee owners push up property prices without contributing to the local economy'. According to a local restaurateur 'my original customers [have sold to ] non-doms who do not live in their [property]. In some apartment blocks 20% were unoccupied... It makes a big difference [to my business]'. The Guardian investigated the occupancy and the ownership of the apartments in St Georges Wharf Tower on the south bank of the Thames. The investigation found that 60% of the apartments were foreign owned, often by companies registered in tax havens. It further found that although there were bedrooms for over 600 people, there were only 60 people registered to vote. Research by the London School of Economics for the Mayor of London found that there was almost no evidence of new build units being left empty, \\"certainly less than 1%\\" and that the \\"vast majority\\" of overseas buyers intended to live in the property or rent it out.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from southern and central Europe (Germany, GB and Ireland, Italy, the Balkans, Croatia), and Spain. It has green, curved or sword-like leaves, tall round stem (with branches), multiple flowers in shades from brown violet, or brown-purple, to purple-violet, blue violet, mauve, and to purple. The large flowers are fragrant, with the scent of elderflowers, hence the name. It was first considered a separate species (when found), then it was classified as a synonym of Iris germanica, before being classified (in some sources) as a separate species again, but with a hybrid origin from Iris pallida and Iris variegata. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to Iris germanica, but it has darker colour flowers and fragranced flowers. It has thick, fleshy or fibrous rhizomes, that are well branched. It has herbaceous, glaucous,William Robinson sword-like, or curving, green leaves. They can grow (in spring,) up to between long, and between 1.3 and 2.5 cm wide. They also smell strongly of elder (Sambucus ebulus). It has a round stem, or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stem is normally taller than the leaves,Lady Charlotte Murray and they are usually branched. The stem has large, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are green at the base but (scarious) or membranous on the top half. The stems (and the many branches) hold 2,William Prince or more flowers, blooming in summer, between April, or May, to June. The large, around long flowers, are fragrant (with the scent of elderflowers), and come in shades of violet, from brown violet, or brown-purple, purple-violet, blue violet, mauve, to purple. They are normally darker than Iris germanica.Daniel Chambers Macreight They can also vary in colour from region to region. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The deflexed falls are spathulate (spoon-like) or oblong shaped, and can be veined, brown-purple on yellow-white background, or with claret (dark red). In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is yellow, golden yellow, or orange. The upright standards are elliptical or oblong shaped, although the tips are inclined to each other. They are also serrated, or jagged. The style arms are light purple and 3‚Äì4 cm long, the perianth tube is 2‚Äì2.5 cm long. After the iris has flowered, most irises produces a seed capsule, but due to the hybrid origin, the capsules are not usually developed. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It is published, that it a chromosome count: 2n=24, or 2n=40. As Iris germanica has a count of 2n=44 or 48 and Iris variegata is counted as 2n=24. Iris variegata is more likely to be the parent species. Taxonomy Painted illustration from Deutschlands Flora in Abbildungen by Jacob Sturm It is commonly known as 'elder scented iris',John MackieThomas Ignatius M. Forster or 'Iris elderflower'. It is known as 'fl√§deriris' in Swedish, or 'holunder schwertlilie' in Germany, (meaning 'elderberry iris'). The Latin specific epithet sambucina refers to sambuci-, sambucinus, -a, or -um elder-like or resembling Sambucus.D. Gledhill This refers to the smell of the flowers resembling the scent of elder-flowers. It was first published and described by Carl Linnaeus in his book Systema Naturae (Syst. Nat) Edition 10, Volume 2 on page 863, on 7 June 1759. It was later named Iris glauca by Richard Anthony Salisbury in the Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London Vol.1 on page 302 in 1812, but this was rejected by all other authors, due to Salisbury's plagiarism history. It was also published in Curtis's Botanical Magazine Vol.6 on tab.187 (with a colour illustration) in 1794, The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1883, the 'Handbook of the Irideae' by J. P. Baker, on page 86 in 1892 and the Journal of RHS Vol.15 on page 3 in October 1899. William Rickatson Dykes notes that Linnaeus had given the names of Iris sambucina and Iris squalens, to 2 similar irises, whose parents were Iris pallida and Iris variegata. It was later classified as a hybrid, but it is unsure which species (of iris) are the parents. It probably originated in the Mediterranean as a diploid species. Many authors think it is a hybrid of Iris variegata L.British Iris Society (1997) and Iris pallida Lam. Others think it is a synonym of Iris germanica L.,Kelly Norris including The Plant List. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life and Catalogue of Life, as a synonym of Iris germanica. It was verified as Iris sambucina by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 9 January 2003, then updated on 12 September 2005.Iris sambucina is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS and listed in the RHS Plant Finder book. Distribution and habitat It is native to southern or central Europe. Range It is found in Europe, within Germany, GB and Ireland, Italy, Balkans (former Yugoslavia), and Spain. Habitat It grows on sunny, well drained rock slopes, in meadows of mountains, and on walls of ancient castles. Within the South Tyrol (of Italy), the plants can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is considered rare, even though it was a wide distribution range. Cultivation It is hardy to between USDA Zone 3a (from ‚àí39.9 ¬∞C (‚àí40 ¬∞F)) to Zone 8b (up to ‚àí9.4 ¬∞C (15 ¬∞F)), including Zone 5. It prefers to grow in calcareous, well drained, or rich soils, in full sun. It can often been cultivated, and can be grown in mixed flower borders, on the margins of shrubberies or being naturalized in the garden. It was introduced to Britain in 1658, and was then cultivated in 1748 in the UK, by Mr Philip Miller. Although, it is not often found in bulb nurseries, but a few cultivars can be found in German nurseries. It can though be attacked by slugs. Propagation It can be propagated by division, due to its hybrid origin, it is sterile and does not produce seed. Hybrids and cultivars It can form hybrids that have flowers in combinations of yellow, red and brown hues. Known cultivars include; Adb-el-Kaker, Abel-Kaver, Cheron, Cherion, Gypsy Queen, Leopold, Leopoldine, M√§gdeberg, Nemesis, President Lincoln and Virgil. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction. References Sources * Ald√©n, B., S. Ryman & M. Hjertson V√•ra kulturv√§xters namn ‚Äì ursprung och anv√§ndning.

The character made his first on-screen appearance on 16 November 2015. Diego was introduced as a new love interest of established character Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) following a chance meeting in Alicante, Spain. Yepez auditioned for the role then met with Barber-Lane and after a successful screen test was offered the part. It was his first regular British television role after moving to the country from Venezuela. The character's first scenes proved controversial due to his ownership of a Confederate flag at a time it was deemed socially unacceptable. Diego is also a Venezuelan national and he is characterised as a romantic person, with honest values and a fresh outlook on life. He also has a cheeky and charming personality. He follows Myra to Hollyoaks village under the impression she is a countess. But despite learning she deceived him the pair resume their relationship. Yepez has explained that his character just tends to follow his heart. His main storyline has focused on his romance with Myra and his desire to start a family with her. The character has proved popular with some critics of the genre, mostly due to the character being deemed aesthetically pleasing. Following the end of his relationship with Myra, Diego departed on 8 March 2017. Casting The character and Yepez's casting were announced on 4 October 2015 via an interview with actress Nicole Barber-Lane published by Digital Spy. Barber- Lane revealed that Yepez had joined the cast to play the new boyfriend of her character Myra McQueen. Yepez met with Barber-Lane during the audition process. Yepez has recalled that he was excited when Hollyoaks invited him to complete a screen test for the role. Yepez stated \\"I didn't know much about Hollyoaks at all so I had to do a crash course. I spent two weeks reading about it and watching online.\\" It was his first regular television work in the United Kingdom after moving from Venezuela. He had previously appeared in one episode of rival soap opera Coronation Street. Development Characterisation and introduction Diego is a Venezuelan character and Yepez also shares his nationality. He is characterised as a romantic, has a very accepting nature and is played as a charming man with a cheeky personality. Yepez told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that Diego is \\"a dreamer, he's adventurous and he's a free spirit. He's quite fun, he's transparent and there's no barriers or games being played.\\" The actor has also called Diego \\"an exotic character\\" who is fun-loving, big-hearted and full of passion. Yepez told Claire Crick from All About Soap that Diego has a \\"very fresh outlook\\" on life. He also believed his character was honest, adding \\"there are no barriers with him. What you see is what you get when it comes to Diego.\\" The character's first scenes caused controversy with viewers because of decor on his camper van. A Confederate flag was displayed on his van while conversing with fellow character Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham). This came at a time some residents of the United States were condemning modern display of the flag. Viewers took to social media to express their outrage that Hollyoaks had displayed the divisive symbol. A spokesperson from the show apologised stating \\"We apologise for any offence caused to our audience, due to this oversight. The flag has been removed from any future episodes.\\" Relationship with Myra McQueen Diego and Myra had met while in the Spanish resort of Alicante. Diego arrives in Hollyoaks village in search of Myra and is under the impression Myra is the \\"Countess of Chester\\" following Myra lying to him. She lied because she feared Diego would not be interested in her if she was not wealthy. Barber-Lane told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"She's living that fantasy out and she doesn't want that to come crashing down, so she doesn't actually want Diego to follow her to Chester at first.\\" Yepez stated that Diego comes to Hollyoaks with no money but determined to make a new life and keep Myra in his life. Myra felt that pretending to be a countess would keep Diego while in Spain. When the truth comes out in the village, she just has to trust that he will stay with her. Barber-Lane revealed that her scenes with Yepez would add fun to the McQueen family at a time they were playing out dark storylines. Producer Bryan Kirkwood had planned to use their relationship to reintroduce some light fun and excitement back into Hollyoaks. Though Barber-Lane warned \\"Myra and Diego will have wicked highs but some lows too. There will be a rollercoaster ride ‚Äì so expect anything!\\" Myra's son John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) is suspicious of Diego's intentions towards her. Myra is also much older than Diego, but Barber-Lane told Kilkelly that she believes Diego and Myra are one hundred percent in love and \\"there was an immediate chemistry when they met in a bar in Spain.\\" Myra tries to hold onto her new-found youth and she believed that Diego had rejuvenated her character into a changed woman. The actress added that viewers would learn much more about Diego's past and that would ultimately decide whether his and Myra's relationship can survive. Myra soon suspects that Diego is being unfaithful when she finds a photograph of him with another woman. She hears him call Maria and expresses his love. Myra confronts Diego but is shocked when he reveals that Maria is his sister. Writer's played a story to test the character's relationship in January 2016. Diego starts working for the Nightingale family at \\"The Dog in the Pond\\" pub. Myra offers to give Nathan Nightingale (Jared Garfield) Spanish lessons despite not knowing the language. Diego had refused to learn Nathan the language and Myra is desperate to hide her scam from Diego because he is so honest. Nathan's sister Ellie Nightingale (Sophie Porley) tries to convince Diego that Myra and Nathan are having an affair. He refuses to believe her, but her scheming has the desired outcome when Diego misinterprets an interaction between Myra and Nathan as being an affair. Diego later witnesses Nathan showing Myra underwear he has purchased for his girlfriend Rachel Hardy (Jennifer Brooke). He informs Rachel that their partners are cheating on them and tries to leave the village. Myra then has to convince Diego that she has not been unfaithful. Writers later began to embed the character amongst the McQueen family and interacting more with John Paul. The storyline begins when John Paul becomes annoyed with Diego and Myra's intimacy around the house. He opines that their relationship is merely about sex and orders them to refrain from being intimate for a day. Diego obliges to prove that their relationship is credible. The incident subsequently brings Diego to the decision that he wants to father a child with Myra. This shocks John Paul who begins to develop feelings for him. Yepez believed that John Paul was only disappointed with Diego because of jealousy. He added that Diego \\"reaches out to him and they establish more of a friendship.\\" Family planning Producers explored the story of Diego's want for a child in March 2016. When Diego informs Myra he wants to start a family of their own she is horrified. Diego does not realise Myra's actual age because she has been dishonest. Yepez told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that it is \\"normal progression\\" for Diego as he views their relationship as being stable. Diego wants Myra to know that he is committed, \\"having a baby ties you together long term, and he wants that emotional stability.\\" He believed Diego's naivety about Myra's age came from their healthy sex life. But Diego ultimately believes that age does not matter because he and Myra are in love. Diego becomes suspicious of Myra's actual age when he looks through old photo albums. Believing she is 38 he is confused about dates and concerned when she lies about her whereabouts. Barber-Lane told Ellis that Myra is closer to 50 and unsure if she still can get pregnant. Myra viewed Diego as \\"young and hot\\" and decided to pretend she was ten years younger to gain his interest. Myra feels younger with Diego but the reality is that she is older. The actress explained that \\"she feels guilty that she may not be able to give him what he wants. She'd love to have a baby with him ‚Äì she just doesn't think she can.\\" Diego's worries about Myra's age are sidelined when she falls over and he finds her visiting the hospital. He assumes that she must be pregnant. In June 2016, episodes featured Mrya hospitalised following a fall down some stairs. She is then informed that she is pregnant and Diego is delighted that his dream of starting a family with Myra has become reality. Introduction of family In July 2016, Kilkelly (Digital Spy) reported that Fernanda Dinez had been cast as Diego's sister Maria. He revealed that Maria would be unwelcome in the McQueen household when Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) learns she is involved in drug trafficking. Her presence causes conflict with Mercedes which effects Myra's health. She is taken to hospital with stomach pains fearing for her unborn child's life. Mercedes also becomes directly involved in Maria's crimes trying to help Diego. The show managed to keep a secret storyline involving Diego and Maria concealed until a revelation episode was broadcast. When Diego and Mercedes force Maria to leave Hollyoaks village, Maria reveals that Diego has been lying and she is his ex-wife rather than his sister. Writers also used Diego and Maria's scenes to imply that the character is hiding more secrets. Jacey Sall√©s was then cast as Diego's mother Juanita Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz. The character was billed as glamorous, wealthy and has the best intentions for her son. A publicist from Hollyoaks told Amy Duncan from Metro that Juanita had \\"very high hopes\\" for Diego and even made monetary promises if she approved of his choice of partner. They revealed that in Diego's backstory Diego and Juanita became estranged following his divorce from Maria. Her \\"hopes were utterly dashed\\" and she refused to give Diego money and ceased contact with him. They added that Diego has a \\"complicated family history\\" and Myra would support a reconciliation between Diego and Juanita. Departure On 8 March 2017, the character made \\"a shock exit\\" when he left the village, following the end of his relationship with Myra. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy confirmed that Yepez had left the cast. Diego's final storyline saw him attempt to scam Frankie Osborne (Helen Pearson). When Myra learns the truth, she decides to \\"turn a blind eye\\" and move to Spain with him and their young daughter. However, when Frankie confesses that she and Diego also had sex, Myra breaks up with him and Diego leaves without a fight. Reception Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap said that Diego was her team's new favourite hunk. She added that she would not miss an episode of the show because of Diego. A Soaplife writer predicted that all of the McQueen family would find themselves vulnerable to succumbing to \\"toyboy\\" Diego's good looks. A writer from BT TV believed that Diego \\"causes a stir\\" on Hollyoaks. Ben Kelly from gay lifestyle Attitude branded Diego \\"handsome\\" and stated that the company's staff were keeping a \\"a very close eye on proceedings\\" between Diego and John Paul. Sarah Ellis (Inside Soap) said \\"call us cynics, but when Myra first returned with toy boy Diego, we couldn't help being suspicious. But after the handsome foreigner weathered the revelation that his lover wasn't actually a countess ‚Äì bless him for believing! ‚Äì he certainly proved us wrong.\\" References External links * Character profile at Channel4.com Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2015 Fictional bartenders Fictional Spanish people Male characters in television ","title":"Diego Salvador Martinez Hernandez De La Cruz"},{"id":"48755921","text":"Mikhail Stepanovitch Olminsky Mikhail Stepanovitch Olminsky () (15 October, 1863‚ÄìMay 8, 1933) (real name: Aleksanderov) was a prominent Russian Bolshevik particularly involved with Party history and also an active literary theorist and publicist.

Each spark location is considered until an adequately optimal point is found. In terms of optimization, when finding an x_j satisfying f(x_j)=y, the algorithm continues until a spark is sufficiently near x_j.

Then the amount of sparks and their locations are determined based on the proximity of the firework to the optimal location.

The Supreme Court's decision was slightly unusual in that a minority (Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge) proposed refining the law in relation to the requirements for causation in relation to actions of the directors where the board had multiple purposes, some of which were improper and some of which were not. However the majority, after initially supporting their position, then declined to express an opinion in the absence of oral argument on that particular point. Accordingly, the legal position in relation to what degree of causation is needed with respect to the improper purpose and the taking of the corporate action is left in a somewhat nebulous state. Facts JKX Oil & Gas Plc (referred to in the judgment as \\"JKX\\") was an English company whose shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange. It was the parent company in a group whose main business consisted of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves, primarily in Russia and the Ukraine. The company had been struggling, and its difficulties were reflected by its share price falling to historically low levels. In 2013, the directors of JKX perceived that it had become the target of a so-called \\"corporate raid\\"In his judgment Lord Sumption acknowledged that this was \\"loose, convenient and pejorative shorthand\\" phrase, but indicated that he would use it despite its pejorative overtones. by two minority shareholders, Eclairs Group Ltd (controlled by trusts associated with Igor Kolomoisky and by Gennadiy Bogolyubov) and Glengary Overseas Ltd (controlled by Alexander Zhukov and Mr Ratskevyich). The articles of association of JKX provided that the company had power to issue a disclosure notice calling for information about persons interested in its shares, and empowering the board to restrict the exercise of rights attaching to shares in the event of non-compliance. The court noted that this power was largely similar to that now found in sections 793‚Äì797 of the Companies Act 2006, save that under the statute the power is vested in the courts whereas under the articles of JKX the power was vested in the board.Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 12. JKX issued disclosure notices between 20 and 26 March 2013 and on 13 May, requesting information from Eclairs, Glengary and Messrs. Kolomoisky, Bogolyubov, Zhukov, and Ratskevyich about the number of shares held, their beneficial ownership, and any agreements or arrangements between the persons interested in them. The responses admitted the existence of interests in the shares but denied that there was any agreement or arrangement. On 23 May 2013, Eclairs publicly invited shareholders to oppose the resolutions proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting on 5 June 2013, including resolutions for the re-election of certain directors. At a meeting on 30 May, the JKX board considered that there were agreements or arrangements between the addressees of the disclosure notices which had not been disclosed in the responses. It resolved to exercise the powers under the company's articles to issue restriction notices in relation to the shares held by Eclairs and Glengary, suspending their right to vote at general meetings and restricting the right of transfer. Eclairs and Glengary challenged the restriction notices, relying on the proper purpose rule at section 171(b) of the Companies Act 2006 (a director must \\"only exercise powers for the purposes for which they are conferred‚Äù). They were successful at first instance, but the decision of Mann J was overturned on appeal. Eclairs and Glengary then appealed to the Supreme Court. Judgment The core question according to Lord Sumption, could be phrased as follows: History of the rule Lord Sumption noted that the proper purpose rule has its origin in the equitable doctrine which is known - misleadingly - as the doctrine of \\"fraud on a power\\".Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 15. For a number of different purposes, the early Court of Chancery in England attached the consequences of fraud to acts which were not actually fraudulent at all, but despite being honest and unexceptional were treated as unconscionable according to equitable principles. Most relevantly, the Court would set aside dispositions under powers conferred by trust deeds if they were outside the purpose for which it was conferred (even if they fell within the strict words of the power itself). Lord Sumption noted that the reported cases relating to the doctrine date back to the mid-1700s in Lane v PageLane v Page (1754) Amb 233 and Aleyn v Belchier.Aleyn v Belchier (1758) 1 Eden 132 Lord Sumption endorsed the comments of Lord Parker in Vatcher v PaullVatcher v Paull [1915] AC 372 at 378 where he said the doctrine \\"does not necessarily denote any conduct on the part of the appointor amounting to fraud in the common law meaning of the term or any conduct which could be properly termed dishonest or immoral. It merely means that the power has been exercised for a purpose, or with an intention, beyond the scope of or not justified by the instrument creating the power.\\" The Supreme Court noted that a company director differs from an express trustee, but confirmed that a director is unquestionably a fiduciary with respect to his powers, and that accordingly the exercise of those powers is limited to the purpose for which they were conferred.Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 16. Application of the rule The Supreme Court held that the proper purpose rule is concerned with abuse of power: a company director must not, subjectively, act for an improper reason. Under article 42 of the company's articles of association, the power to restrict the rights attaching to shares is ancillary to the statutory power to call for information under section 793 of the Companies Act. Article 42 has three closely related purposes: # to induce a shareholder to comply with a disclosure notice; # to protect the company and its shareholders against having to make decisions about their respective interests in ignorance of relevant information; and # as a punitive sanction for a failure to comply with a disclosure notice. Seeking to influence the outcome of shareholders' resolutions or the company's general meetings is no part of those proper purposes.Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 32. The proper purpose rule applies to article 42. It was irrelevant whether Eclairs and Glengary could have averted the imposition of restrictions on their rights as shareholders by giving different answers to the questions. The proper purpose rule is the principal means by which equity enforces directors' proper conduct, and is fundamental to the constitutional distinction between board and shareholder. A battle for control of the company is probably the context where the proper purpose rule has the most valuable part to play.Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 37. Lord Sumption and Lord Hodge considered that where the directors have multiple concurrent purposes, the relevant purpose or purposes are those without which the decision would not have been made. If that purpose or those purposes are improper, the decision is ineffective. Mann J had found as a fact that four of the six directors were concerned only with the effect of the restriction notices on the outcome of the general meeting, and accordingly, they had acted for an improper purpose. Multiple purposes Lord Sumption was concerned about the position where: \\"there are multiple purposes, all influential in different degrees but some proper and others not\\".Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 17. His preferred solution (with which Lord Hodge agreed) was that a causation based \\"but for\\" test should be applied to whether the improper purpose caused the exercise of the power. In his view \\"if there were proper reasons for exercising the power and it would still have been exercised for those reasons even in the absence of improper ones, it is difficult to see why justice should require the decision to be set aside.\\"Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 21. He cited with approval the Australian High Court's test that the improper purpose must be \\"causative\\".Whitehouse v Carlton House Pty (1987) 162 CLR 285 at 294, \\"[The exercise of a power] will be invalidated if the impermissible purpose was causative in the sense that, but for its presence, 'the power would not have been exercised'.\\" per Dixon J He also drew support from obiter dictum of Lord Wilberforce in the leading case of Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd.Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Petroleum Ltd [1974] AC 821 Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Clarke all agreed that the appeals should be allowed, but decline to express a concluded view on the application of a \\"but for\\" test to the proper purpose rule proposed by Lord Sumption and supported by Lodge Hodge. They felt that the previous settled law that the court should look to the \\"primary purpose\\".Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 51. This was not a matter on which the court should rule without the benefit of argument. Lord Mance was particularly concerned that after the Supreme Court had circulated its draft judgment to the parties, the appellants responded by stating that they had argued their case on the basis that the \\"principal purpose\\" test was not being challenged by the respondents, and the respondents had responded by arguing the proposed test on causation was a \\"new development in the law\\" and so the appeals should not be allowed and/or that there should be a further hearing on the issue of causation.Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil & Gas plc, at paragraph 49. Lord Sumption noted their reservations, but pointed out that whilst oral argument had not been heard on that specific point, it had been canvassed in the parties' written submissions. In the event all five members of the Court agreed to allow the appeal, and Lord Sumption and Lord Mance have made clear their views on that particular point of law. Obiter comments Lord Sumption commented that generally held (but not commonly stated) view that the shareholders do not owe a duty of loyalty to each other or to the company. Commentary One commentator noted that the case offers \\"valuable guidance\\" in relation to the proper purpose rule, and another the case casts \\"considerable light\\" on the key legal considerations, including in particular discerning the proper purpose in relation to any particular matter, and the proper way for the courts to examine such board decisions. However, at least one commentator thought that \\"for corporate advisers and directors, the decision may present some difficulties.\\" See also *United Kingdom company law Footnotes 2015 in case law 2015 in British law United Kingdom company case law Corporate governance in the United Kingdom Mergers and acquisitions Petroleum industry in the United Kingdom ","title":"Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc"},{"id":"48756031","text":"Lilias Margitson Rider Haggard, MBE (9 December 1892 ‚Äì 9 January 1968) was the fourth and youngest child of the British writer Sir Henry Rider Haggard and Mariana Louisa Margitson.Dawson Haggard D.,The History of the Haggard Family in England and America: 1433-1899 (Albany, New York, 1899) - retrieved online at on 3 October 2010 She was educated at Saint Felix School, Southwold, Suffolk and was awarded an MBE for her work as an auxiliary nurse during World War I.

The hospital is part of the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and is built on the site of the former Southern General Hospital, in Govan and opened in June 2015. The hospital replaced the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill. It is managed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. History The Royal Hospital for Children, like the adjacent Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, was designed by Nightingale Associates, with construction carried out by Brookfield Multiplex, who previously built Wembley Stadium. The new hospital was built on the site of the old Southern General Hospital. In January 2010, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde closed the Queen Mother's Maternity Hospital at Yorkhill, with maternity services relocating to the Southern General Hospital. Construction started in early 2011. Originally to be called Royal Hospital for Sick Children, it was named Royal Hospital for Children. It was originally hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2014, but medical services did not start to be transferred until 10 June 2015. Design The new children's hospital is a mix of four-bedded and single- bedded accommodation. The design included a part covered roof garden where it was intended that young patients would be able to enjoy a range of activities in the fresh air. In 2016 the roof garden play area was closed amid health and safety concerns. The hospital has a 47-seat cinema, which was built in partnership with MediCinema costing around ¬£250,000 to install. In addition to the 47 seats the facility serves patients in wheelchairs and beds. Services The Royal Hospital for Children, while retaining a somewhat separate identity from the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, is adjoined and integrated with the adult hospital. With 256 beds and 5 floors, it replaced the Royal Hospital for Sick Children located in Yorkhill, Glasgow.

Published by Octagon Press in 1968, the book was re- released in paperback, ebook and audiobook editions by The Idries Shah Foundation in 2015. Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin can be read as part of a whole course of study. Content Idries Shah Part of a series of books, The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin is a collection of teaching stories, anecdotes and jokes drawn from Middle Eastern folklore and the Sufi mystical tradition, which feature the populist Middle Eastern philosopher and wise fool, Mulla Nasrudin. Thousands of stories have been written around this popular folk character over the centuries, since his purported birth in the 13th century in what is now modern Turkey. Reception Douglas Hill, Literary Editor of the socialist Tribune weekly magazine, wrote in 1969 that The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin contained ‚Äúa great deal of timeless and universal wisdom made accessible and highly attractive with humour‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúconventional responses and received frames of mind are challenged on every page.‚Äù In The New York Times, award-winning writer and later winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing called The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin ‚Äúperhaps the most shocking to our assumptions about ‚Äòmysticism‚Äô‚Äù of Shah's books at the time. She said that this corpus of Nasrudin ‚Äújokes‚Äù was ‚Äúdeliberately created to inculcate Sufic thinking, to outwit The Old Villain, which is a name for the patterns of conditioned thinking which form the prison in which we all live.‚Äù In an earlier review in The Observer, Doris Lessing pointed out that most of the jokes in the book were new to the West; while others could also be found in the written work of Sufis like Rumi, Attar and Jami. She explained that ‚Äú[Nasrudin's] antics are parallels of the mind's workings, designed to amuse the teahouses, but also for use on other levels‚Äù. As an example she refers to their use at an international scientific conference to illustrate problems in physics that were otherwise difficult or impossible to verbalise.

Founded in 1979 as the Citizens Council for Budget Research, Florida TaxWatch conducts research that aims to improve government efficiency and accountability. Florida TaxWatch is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit educational and research organization. Since 1982, the organization has been led by President and CEO Dominic M. Calabro. Florida TaxWatch has six Centers of Excellence, each with their own legislative and policy priorities. The six Centers include the Center for Health and Aging, the Center for Educational Performance and Accountability, the Center for Government Efficiency, the Center for Florida Citizenship, the Center for Smart Justice, and the Center for Competitive Florida. The group is best known for its annual Budget Turkey report. History In 1977, incoming Florida Senate President Phil Lewis approached Mark Hollis, then Vice President of Publix Super Markets, about the business community coming to the Florida Legislature to seek increases in consumer taxes rather than finding ways to hold the line on spending. Following this discussion, the two decided that a state government watchdog was needed. An organizational meeting convened in Tampa two years later resulted in the formation of the Citizens Council for Budget Research, which five years later was renamed Florida TaxWatch. The founders were Winn-Dixie Chairman J.E. Davis, T. Wayne Davis, Publix Super Markets founder George Jenkins and President Mark Hollis, and Florida State Senator Phil Lewis and Florida State Senator Ken Plante. Florida TaxWatch is currently located in the former St. James Christian Methodist Episcopal church. Built in 1899, the church was constructed on land purchased by black members of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church and was, at one point, the oldest African-American church in Tallahassee. Activities Publications Florida TaxWatch publishes various research reports, briefings, and periodicals. Notable publications include its annual Budget Turkey report, a monthly Economic Commentary, and a monthly Budget Watch. Events Florida TaxWatch holds various events throughout the year including: * The Prudential Productivity Awards, which celebrates innovative state employees who increase productivity and accountability within state government agencies. * The Principal Leadership Awards, which honors Florida principals at at-risk schools that have made significant learning gains. * Annual Board Meetings in Spring and Fall * The State of the Taxpayer Dinner, which is an annual dinner event at the beginning of the Florida Legislative Session. * Telehealth Cornerstone Conference, which seeks to educate business and community leaders about the advantages of expanding telehealth in the state of Florida.

She carried a Bible and a bell, and travelled on foot, by bus and train, through eastern Nigeria preaching at markets, starting with Enugu market. Hers was a faith ministry and she soon came to realise that she had the gift of prophecy and healing. She inspired a group of twelve itinerant evangelists to join her in her activities and started a prayer group at Onitsha in the same year. General Overseer Over the years the church has grown, and by 2002 had become an international organisation with nearly eight hundred congregations. By 2006, the church had nearly two million members and had congregations in three quarters of the states of Nigeria, and had also established a congregation in Togo, Kenya, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Republic of Benin, Ghanaand more are still developing.

Design and construction The Class 680 was designed as the \\"normalized\\" successor of the famous Class 500 (reclassified by the Ferrovie dello Stato as Class 670) fast locomotives of the Rete Adriatica; in fact, even before the RA ended up being nationalized in the Ferrovie dello Stato in 1905, there was already a project (with the projected classification RA 550 for a fast 2-6-2 locomotive which shared several similarities with what would end up becoming, under the FS ownership, the Class 680. The Class featured the widespread Italian bogie, and the same Plancher compound engine of the Class 500, an arrangement in which the two high pressure (HP) and the two low pressure (LP) cylinders were paired together respectively on the left and the right side of the locomotive, with each pair being served by a single piston valve via crossed ports. This ingenious arrangement was simple, but it made the locomotive somewhat unbalanced and unstable, especially at higher speed. The Class 680 was built from 1907 to 1909 in 151 units by Ernesto Breda, Gio. Ansaldo & C. and Berliner Maschinenbau, with the last two locomotives being built by the former company respectively in 1909 and 1911. Initially, the Class 680 was fitted with a three-axle tender with a water capacity of , but it proved prone to derail at high speeds (especially on the Genoa-Ventimiglia line); therefore, those were swapped with the bogie tenders of the Class 625, with a higher capacity of . Service A brief success The first locomotive, when outshopped from the Ernesto Breda factory in 1907, was initially assigned the classification FS 6401, but a few days later it was reclassified FS 6801. Over the next years, new classifications with five and eventually six numbers (with the class and the running numbers separated by a full stop) were adopted, the class ending up as 680.XXX. The Class 680 proved to be a thoroughly good locomotive, replacing the Class 670 from the most important services on the Rome-Naples and Florence-Rome railways. During a trial run, the locomotive 6801 (later 680.001) pulled from Parma to Piacenza a special train weighing , reaching a top speed of . However, its success was relatively brief, as in 1912 the Class 685, basically its simple-expansion and superheated version, entered service; the new locomotive was more powerful and had smoother riding qualities, and thus the recent Class 680 locomotives ended up obsolete. Rebuilds and conversions The last two locomotives built, the 680.150 and 151, had been fitted experimentally with a superheater from the start, but results had not been positive, as the theoretical increase in performance was offset by the reduction of steaming ability. Nevertheless, this experiment paved the way for a general rebuilding campaign for the whole class, in a bid to achieve the same performance as the Class 685. From 1918 to 1924 seventy- three locomotives were rebuilt with a new small-tube superheater; initially allocated to the subclass 680.2XX, they were eventually reclassified in the new Class 681. A further fifteen locomotives (with two more being obtained by modifying two Class 681) also received larger HP cylinders ( instead of ); these, initially allocated to the 680.4XX subclass, were eventually reclassified Class 682. The latter were the maximum evolution of the Plancher compound engine for passenger trains. In 1924 and 1925, the Class 682 locomotives were assigned to the shed of Ancona and subjected to comparative trials against the Class 685; the results proved that, although the former were slightly more powerful than the latter ( instead of ), they had higher consumption of water and coal, and did not ride as smoothly at high speed as the 685s. This resulted in the decision to stop any further rebuilds, and instead outright convert not only the remaining Class 680 locomotives, but also the 681 and 682, into Class 685 locomotives. These conversion lasted from 1925 to 1933, at the end of which only four Class 680, twelve Class 681 and fifteen Class 682 remained unrebuilt, with all the remaining 120 locomotives becoming the subclasses 685.3XX and 685.5XX in the Class 685, and the separate Class S.685.5XX. The last years The unrebuilt locomotives continued to serve on secondary roles for the rest of their careers; before World War Two they were already being used sporadically, but during the conflict they were returned to active service. After the war, their withdrawals began, and by 1955 these were all completed. Preservation One Class 680, the 680.037, survived in preservation; after a lengthy stay in Merano, she was eventually transferred to the Pietrarsa railway museum.

Selznick's Vanguard Films, for the United States Public Health Service, dramatizing the need for volunteer military nurses for the U. S. Cadet Nurse Corps during World War II. Directed by Jacques Tourneur, the 10-minute film stars Dorothy McGuire in one of her first films. The story by Mary C. McCall, Jr., dramatizes the choice that young Peggy Adams makes to become a nurse, her training, and her volunteering for military nursing service. The cast includes Aline MacMahon, James Brown, Spring Byington and Tom Tully. Reward Unlimited was released May 18, 1944. Distributed by the United States Office of War Information, the film was exhibited in 16,000 theaters and seen by an estimated 90 million people. It was also presented at Cadet Nurse Corps recruitment events nationwide in 1944 and 1945. Plot Dorothy McGuire and Aline MacMahon in Reward Unlimited Peggy Adams (Dorothy McGuire) and her fianc√© Paul (James Brown) talk on the eve of his departure for active duty. He tells her, \\"We'll be married, but afterwards, after we've won the war.\\" Peggy tells him she is going to find some war work herself‚Äî\\"Something that will make you proud of me, something that means something, to bring you home quicker.\\" They part at the railroad station, and on her way home Peggy falls on the sidewalk. A kind nurse (Aline MacMahon) helps her. While bandaging Peggy's knee she tells her about the important work of the new U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps, and its great need for nurses. Back at home, Peggy tries to enlist the support of her mother (Spring Byington), who dismisses the idea of her becoming a cadet nurse‚Äîbut Peggy's father (Tom Tully) encourages her. In a montage, Peggy undergoes training and is graduated from the program. The last scenes show Peggy and a fellow nurse walking down a hospital corridor, where they hear a child crying. Peggy goes into a dark room, switches on the light and comforts a young boy (Butch Jenkins) who has awoken from a nightmare. He tells her that he likes her more than the other nurses because she has \\"kind of an inside shine\\" that shows in her eyes. Peggy says, \\"I guess that's what happens when you're happy,\\" and she switches off the light. The film ends with Peggy walking toward the camera, while a narrator encourages qualified female viewers to apply for the Cadet Nurse Corps.

Milan Cathedral in the background. As the main economic and industrial center in Italy, and the country's second largest city, Milan was subjected to heavy bombing during World War II, being the most bombed city in Northern Italy and one of the most bombed cities in the country. The first raids, 1940 During the first years of war (until 1943/1944), Milan could only be reached by bombers of the RAF Bomber Command coming from England. The first raids were precision bombings carried out by small numbers of planes, mainly with industrial objectives, which caused little damage and few casualties. The first raid happened in the night of 15/16 June 1940, five days after Italy entered the war; a few buildings were hit and one person was killed.Marco Gioannini, Giulio Massobrio, Bombardate l'Italia. Storia della guerra di distruzione aerea 1940‚Äì1945, pp. 9-25-29-40-46-71-73-83-86-97-100-112-113-116-119-176 to 179-196 to 202-221-222-227 to 229-235-236-265-273-293-295-298-326 to 328-339-344-346 to 354-371 to 373-381-383 to 385-423-431-442 to 445-447-458 to 460-465-487-488-493. On the following night, eight aircraft dropped bombs on the Caproni plant, causing little damage. Destroyed factories in Milan Bombings were renewed during August 1940. On the night of 13/14 August, three bombers dropped bombs and propaganda leaflets; the target was again the Caproni plant which however was not hit, while several buildings along a few streets were, with 15 killed and 44 wounded. On the night of 15/16 August another raid ensued, but the reaction of the anti-aircraft batteries shot down one Vickers Wellington bomber, and induced the others to drop their load over the towns of Merate and Mariano Comense. On the night of 18/19 August another bombing by four planes hit the Innocenti and Caproni plants and the Linate Airport. On the night of 26 August, eleven bombers bombed the Idroscalo. One final bombing (by three planes) was carried out on 18/19 December 1940, targeting the Pirelli plant but instead causing slight damage to a few houses and killing eight people, wounding 16. No bombings were carried out during 1941, and until the autumn of 1942. The area bombing, 1942‚Äì1943 The Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie after the August 1943 bombings After Bomber Command adopted area bombing as it main tactic, under the command of Sir Arthur Harris, and after a series of bombings on Germany during the spring and summer of 1942, in autumn 1942 an area bombing campaign was launched against the three cities of Italy's \\"industrial triangle\\", Milan, Turin, and Genoa. While Turin and Genoa suffered seven and six raids, respectively, Milan was in this phase the least targeted city. Nonetheless, on 24 October 1942, 73 Avro Lancasters dropped 135 tons of bombs, including 30,000 incendiaries, over the city, in a rare case of RAF diurnal bombing. 441 buildings were hit, including the San Vittore jail, the headquarters of the Hoepli, two train stations and the Cimitero Monumentale. 171 people were killed and about 300 wounded. Four Lancasters were lost, only one of them to AA fire. Although over 330 fires were started,Giorgio Bonacina, \\"La RAF cancella intere citt√†\\", on \\"Storia Illustrata\\" n. 172 ‚Äì March 1972 it was judged that the incendiaries were much less effective than in previous raids on German cities; as it had already been shown by the bombing of Genoa, Italian cities were less vulnerable to firebombing than the German ones. This was mainly due to wider streets, which prevented fires from spreading across them, and minimal use of wood in the buildings. Milan cathedral was designated by Harris as the 'aiming point' for the area bombing. Although the cathedral was not hit during this raid, Harris's decision to centre the raid on a major religious building drew criticism from his superior, Charles Portal and some members of parliament. Another raid with 71 planes was planned for the following night, but poor weather dispersed the formation and only 39 bombers reached Milan (six were lost, and many others randomly dropped their bombs on several towns and villages of Lombardy), causing little more damage. Two more people were killed, and thousands started to flee from the city. At the beginning of 1943 the Italian anti-aircraft defenses, which had proved not to be very effective, were joined by German Flak batteries. The success rate of the anti-aircraft fire, however, did not improve significantly. After a pause of nearly four months, Milan suffered a new area bombing on the night of 14/15 February 1943, when 142 Lancasters dropped 110 tons of explosive bombs and 166 tons of incendiary bombs over the city. Several factories were damaged, including Alfa Romeo, Caproni, Isotta Fraschini and Breda; the Milano Centrale railway station and the Farini marshalling yard were also hit. Residential areas were also badly damaged, with 203 houses destroyed, 596 heavily damaged and over 3,000 slightly damaged; the headquarters of Corriere della Sera suffered heavy damage. Several historical buildings suffered various extents of damage, including the Royal Palace of Milan, the Teatro Lirico, the Basilica of San Lorenzo, San Giorgio al Palazzo and the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine. To extinguish the many fires, it was necessary to call firefighters from all neighbouring provinces and even from Bologna. 133 people were killed in the attack, 442 were wounded and over 10,000 were left homeless. Schools had to close down, and more citizens evacuated the city. The only RAF loss was one Lancaster shot down. After this attack, Milan was not bombed for six more months, but at the beginning of August 1943, following the fall of Mussolini, it was decided to start a series of heavy bombings on the main Italian cities, to persuade the Badoglio government to surrender. On the night of 7/8 August 1943, 197 bombers took off from bases in England to carry out a simultaneous bombing of Milan, Turin, and Genoa. Milan was bombed by 72 aircraft (two of which were shot down by AA fire), which dropped 201 tons of bombs, mainly incendiaries. Large parts of the city centre were set ablaze; 600 buildings were destroyed, with 161 victims and 281 wounded among the population. The only factory that was damaged was the Pirelli plant. The headquarters of the Corriere della Sera were hit again and partly destroyed; among the public and historical buildings that suffered heavy damage were the Sforza Castle, the Natural History Museum, the Villa Belgiojoso Bonaparte and Palazzo Sormani. The Pinacoteca di Brera was also hit. Public transport was no longer possible in the city centre, as most of the streets were obstructed by ruins or sprinkled with craters. Damage of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio On the night of 12/13 August, Bomber Command launched its heaviest raid on Milan and any Italian city. 504 bombers (321 Lancasters and 183 Halifaxes) took off from English bases, and 478 of them reached Milan and dropped 1,252 tons of bombs (670 explosive bombs and 582 incendiary bombs), including 245 4,000-lb blockbusters and 380,000 incendiary devices, over the city. This was the heaviest single air raid ever suffered by an Italian city. The bombing caused massive fires in many parts of Milan; the fires drew air from the surrounding countryside, creating winds that reached a speed of 50 km/h, an event that usually heralded a firestorm, which however did not materialize (owing to the humid climate, in addition to the previously mentioned urbanistic traits typical of Italian cities, and the fact that the raid was heavy but not very concentrated). Most of Milan's most famous buildings were hit during the raid; the Sforza Castle was further damaged, Palazzo Marino (the city hall) and Santa Maria delle Grazie were partly destroyed, the San Fedele Church and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II suffered heavy damage. The Milan Cathedral was also hit by some bombs. The Alfa Romeo plant and the fair ground were also damaged. The death toll, although never fully ascertained, was an estimated 700 deaths; casualties were not higher because about 900,000 of the city's 1,150,000 inhabitants had already left after the previous attacks. Most of those who were still in Milan evacuated the city on August 13. The RAF lost three bombers. On the night of 14/15 August, fires were still raging when another bombing was carried out by 134 Lancasters (ouf of 140 which had originally taken off; one was lost), which dropped 415 more tons of bombs. Several factories (Breda, Pirelli, Innocenti, Isotta Fraschini) and the Farini marshalling yard were badly hit; the Sforza Castle and the Royal Palace were further damaged, and Teatro Dal Verme was partly destroyed, as was the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. The Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio also suffered heavy damage. The few remaining citizens helped firefighters and UNPA (Unione Nazionale Protezione Antiaerea, National Anti-Aircraft Protection Union) in the attempts to control the fires, but the destruction of the aqueduct pipes hampered the efforts. The official death toll of this raid was of only nine killed, presumably due to the small number of people who were still in the city. On the following night, 186 Lancasters (13 more bombers did not reach the target; 7 were lost, mainly to Luftwaffe fighters on the way back) carried out a final raid, during which they dropped an additional 601 tons of bombs. Several districts suffered further damage; the cathedral was hit again, and the La Scala theatre and the Ospedale Maggiore were heavily damaged; the La Rinascente store was destroyed. 183 people were killed. At this point, Bomber Command halted its attacks, as it was thought that the \\"persuasive\\" effect had been achieved, and further bombings could have instead fueled anti-British sentiment. The four August raids had caused over 1,000 dead and hit half of the buildings in the city, destroying or heavily damaging 15% of them and leaving over 250,000 people homeless. The work of 5,000 workers and 1,700 soldiers was needed to remove the ruins. Water, light and gas supply resumed within 48 hours, while public transport was nearly annihilated. No more raids were carried out during the rest of 1943, and life in the city was slowly resumed. 1944‚Äì1945, the USAAF bombings and the Gorla tragedy The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II after the August 1943 bombing After the Summer of 1943 and the armistice of Cassibile, the Bomber Command ended its area bombing campaign over Northern Italy. Milan was not bombed for several months thereafter, but in spring 1944, with the progress of the Italian Campaign, a new bombing campaign was started, this time by USAAF (by day) and RAF MAAF (by night). The bombings mainly targeted the city's marshalling yards and factories, but inaccuracy in bombing often caused severe damage to residential areas and civilian casualties. The first bombing of 1944 took place in the night between 28 and 29 March, when 78 Vickers Wellington of the RAF MAAF bombers attacked the Milano Lambrate railway station. The target was hit, with the destruction of rails and about 300 wagons, but bombs also fell on the surrounding areas, killing 18 inhabitants and wounding 45. On the morning of 29 March, a further 139 bombers of the USAAF Fifteenth Air Force attacked the same target, destroying 500 more wagons, five locomotives and over 5 km of rails; 59 people were killed. No planes were shot down in either instance. On April 30 a new bombing by the Fifteenth Air Force destroyed the Breda factory and inflicted further damage on the Lambrate marshalling yard (32 locomotives and 100 wagons were destroyed); in addition to these targets, the city was also hit, resulting in 40 civilian casualties. On the night of 13 May eight MAAF bombers, sent to attack the Lambrate marshalling yard, missed their target and dropped their bombs over Gorgonzola and Cernusco sul Naviglio. On the night of 10/11 July 1944, 84 MAAF Wellingtons bombed the Lambrate railway station once again, but this time the damage was not heavy (and one of the planes was lost); three nights later, 89 Wellingtons attacked the same target, but two were hit by AA fire and the marshalling yard suffered limited damage. On 10 September, 71 MAAF bombers launched one more strike against the Lambrate station, which was hit along with the surrounding city (52 casualties). The last heavy bombing suffered by Milan took place on 20 October 1944. On this day, a group of 111 USAAF bombers were sent to bomb the Breda, Isotta Fraschini and Alfa Romeo plants; while the groups assigned to attack the Isotta Fraschini and Alfa Romeo hit their targets, the 36 Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the 451st Bomb Group missed the Breda factory due to a navigation error, and their commander, upon realizing the mistake, decided to release the bombs immediately (it was not possible anymore to go back to the Breda plant). This resulted in about 80 tons of bombs falling over the heavily populated suburbs of Gorla and Precotto; 614 civilians were killed, among them over 400 children and 19 nuns and personnel of the \\"Francesco Crispi\\" elementary school, which received a direct hit while the children and school personnel were going downstairs to the air raid shelter. The only two survivors were students, Noemi Cappellini and Antonio Skomina, both 7 years old at the time, who both refused the orders of the nuns to remain in the air raid shelter. After 20 October 1944, no more bombings were carried out on Milan. Countless minor air attacks, mainly strafing and bombing actions by fighter-bombers and light bombers, took place throughout the autumn of 1944, the subsequent winter and the spring of 1945; trains, vehicles, modes of transport and more generally targets of opportunity were attacked. Dozens more civilians were killed, as it was not possible to distinguish trains and vehicles used by the Wehrmacht and those carrying civilians. Damage and casualties Damage to the Ospedale Maggiore Although a reliable and complete count has never been made, it has been estimated that at least 2,200 people were killed in the bombings of Milan; the second heaviest death toll in Northern Italy (Bologna suffered 2,481 casualties). At least 400,000 people, more than one third of the population, were left homeless. At the end of the war, Milan had suffered heavy damage from the air raids; out of 930,000 rooms that existed before the war, 360,000 were destroyed or heavily damaged, and over 200,000 suffered lighter damage. Overall, about one third of the buildings were destroyed or had to be subsequently demolished; the ruins were used to create the artificiali hill known as Monte Stella. The heavy destruction of the areas surrounding the city centre and the unregulated building that ensued in the reconstruction years left this part of Milan heavily disfigured. Due to the area bombing focusing on the city centre, the cultural heritage was hit the hardest; three quarters of the historical buildings suffered various extents of damage, including the Cathedral, the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Santa Maria delle Grazie, the Sforza Castle, the Royal Palace, La Scala and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The industry and transport system, having been prime targets for the whole duration of the war, also suffered heavy damage; the main factories (Caproni, Innocenti, Pirelli, Breda, Alfa Romeo, Isotta Fraschini) suffered heavy damage, as did most of the railway stations. Public transport inside the city was completely disrupted.

Though almost forgotten as a figure in the Palestinian movement for independence, he played an important role in it, and witnessed many momentous moments in the early history of the 20th century. Aside from his native Arabic, he was fluent in French, Russian and Spanish. He was present with his father when Sherif Hussein launched the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916; the beginning of Zionist immigration to Palestine; the early years of the establishment of communism in the Soviet Union, and was one of the few Arabs who fought on the Republican side against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. At the outbreak of World War II, he wrote a book in which the thesis of the incompatibility of Nazism with Islam was passionately argued. Biography Sidqi was born into a middle-class Palestinian family in Jerusalem in 1905. His father Bakri Sidqi was a teacher of Turkish ancestry. His mother, Nazira Murad, came from a prominent Jerusalem mercantile family. After an early education there, he joined his father in 1914 as the latter worked in other parts of the Ottoman Empire, and in his formative years he grew up in Damascus, Cairo and Jeddah in the Hejaz, where Bakri had joined Prince Faisal's campaign. On returning to Palestine he became an employee of the Mandatory Palestine's Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There he met Jewish workers who introduced him to Communism. He spent three years, from 1925 to 1928, at the Comintern's Communist University of the Toilers of the East (KUTV, pronounced Kutvo), and during his time there married a Ukrainian communist. He developed contacts with Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin, Georges Marchais and Khalid Bakdash, the Kurdish leader of the Syrian Communist Party, met Mao Zedong and got acquainted with the Turkish poet N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet and members of the family of Jawaharlal Nehru. He returned with his wife to Palestine in 1928, and they began to organise activities against the British Mandate authorities. On the occasion of the 1929 riots, the Jewish Communists were split between those who sympathised with victims of the massacres, and others who, like the Arab Communists, considered the moment to be one of an Arab revolt against the British occupation, land seizure and the pauperisation of the peasantry. Based in Haifa, where he supervised the Party's local branch, Sidqi maintained regular contacts with Sheik Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, and defined the latter's death in 1935 as one of martyrdom. The Comintern had instructed the Palestine Communist Party to Arabise as early as 1924, without much success. One of the tasks the Party assigned to Sidqi was to undertake this Arabisation. The Palestine branch of the party was largely dominated by Jews with socialist tendencies and was suspected of having in its ranks militants with crypto-Zionist sympathies. In 1930, Sidqi was picked up by the British police in Jaffa and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment, which he served in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Akka. His elder brother Ahmad, who had also studied with him at KUTV, was the chief witness for the prosecution. In Sidqi's recollection, Ahmad is described as fragile and being coerced into confessions by beatings. British reports cast him as a police informer, who provided extensive details of Comintern contacts and training. Towards the end of 1932, on his release from prison, where he made the acquaintance of Abu Jilda, the 'Dillinger of the desert,' the Party ordered him to contact Awni Abd al-Hadi in order to begin to coordinate with the Istiqlal Independence Party. As British surveillance intensified, the Communist Party smuggled him abroad in June 1933 to Paris where he assumed the editorship of the Comintern's Arabic- language journal, The Arab East. The French authorities subsequently arrested him and had him deported back to Palestine. He later dated his opposition to Nazism to this period - Hitler assumed power in 1933. In 1935 he was sent to Tashkent to study directly the issue of nationality under communism. While in Uzbekistan he developed close relationships with the Uzbek communist leaders Akmal Ikramov and Fayzulla Khodzhayev. Both sided with Nikolai Bukharin's agrarian policies, which ran counter to the line set down by Stalin. They also familiarised him with the ideas of the Left Opposition to Stalinism associated with Grigory Zinoviev. His two Uzbek friends were killed shortly afterwards, victims of Stalin's Great Purge. Sidqi had first hand experience of Nazi Germany, having travelled through the country in 1936, and when, later, party loyalty dictated silence after the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, he refused to buckle under and conceal his disagreement. Sidqi was one of at least four Palestinian Arabs, the other three being Mahmoud al-Atrash, Ali Abds al-Khaliq and Fawsi al-Nabulsi, who are known to have fought on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil war. This kind of involvement was harshly criticised by mainstream Palestinian newspapers (although not by local Communist pamphlets). Reflecting the general trend of the Palestinian national movement, newspapers like Filastin were averse to Communism and backed the Spanish Fascists, partly out of a desire to antagonise both Great Britain and France, the region's colonial powers. While in Spain, where he arrived in August 1936, Sidqi undertook, on Comintern instructions, to travel under a Moroccan alias, as Mustafa Ibn Jala, and conduct propaganda aimed at dissuading Moroccans in Franco's forces from fighting on the fascist side. He argued that the fascist ideology was contrary to Islam. In Barcelona, he introduced himself in Spanish to the local government militia, according to his memoirs, in the following terms: > I am an Arab volunteer. I have come to defend liberty in Madrid, to defend > Damascus in Guadalajara, Jerusalem in C√≥rdoba, Baghdad in Toledo, Cairo in > Zaragoza, and Tatwan in Burgos. Under the pseudonym of \\"Mustafa Ibn Jala\\" he wrote for the Communist newspaper Mundo Obrero, urging Moroccans to desert the fascist army. Most of his activity however consisted of making radio broadcasts, writing pamphlets in Arabic, and haranguing Moroccan troops in their trenches by means of a megaphone. His proposal that an anti-colonial revolution be stirred up in the Moroccan Rif in order to deprive the fascists of cannon fodder met with resolute opposition from Dolores Ib√°rruri, La Pasionaria of the Spanish Communist Party, who is said to have opposed any alliance with what she called 'hordes of Moors, beastly savages (morisma salvaje) drunk with sensuality who rape our women and daughters.' Frustrated by the few Moroccans who were convinced, and experiencing the party's hostility to them, he left Spain in December 1936. Sidqi then moved to Algeria where he tried, unsuccessfully, to set up a clandestine radio station to broadcast appeals for the natives of the Rif mountains to desert. Ib√°rruri's opposition to his work led to him being banned from returning to Republican Spain. Thereafter the Party had him return to Lebanon where he resumed his journalistic activities. In 1940, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he published a book-length study which argued for the incompatibility of Nazism and Islamic tradition. The work, entitled The Islamic Traditions and the Nazi Principles: Can They Agree? was simultaneously published in Beirut and Cairo. Together with the strain in his personal relations with the leader of the Syrian Communist Party, Khalid Bakdash, the publication led to his expulsion from the Communist Party, which regarded the work's dependence on many Islamic texts as contrary to the secularist principles of Marxism. In the postwar period he enjoyed a successful career as a literary critic and broadcaster in both Lebanon and Cyprus. He had a son, and one of his daughters became a prominent doctor in the Soviet Union. A literary prize in his honour, the Najati Sidqi Competition, has been held in Ramallah. Sidqi died in exile in Athens in 1979. Literary activities His book 'An Arab Who Fought in Spain' was published under the name of Khalid Bakdash, his Kurdish adversary within the Communist Party, a fact which only increased his enmity towards both Bakdash and the Party. His translations included works ranging from major American and Chinese novelists to Russian classics: he introduced Alexander Pushkin, Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky to the Arabic world. He published two collections of short stories, many of them depicting the lives and inner feelings of the lower classes. The first, The Sad Sisters (al-Akhwat al-Hazinat, Cairo 1953), looks at the problems Palestinians encountered in adjusting from traditional, romantically remembered Arab Jaffa to the rising metropolis of Tel Aviv and the strange habits of foreigners, the new Jewish society. The title story (1947) is a narrative of a Palestinian man, sitting down at the base of one of five sycamore trees, the ragged residue of what was once an Arab orchard, and imagining them as five sisters who in mourning clothes recall the rapid changes as the orchard was taken over by the modern urban sprawl. As an autumnal storm sweeps the area, the trees stand firm like 'towering mountains'. The second, The Communist Millionaire (Beirut 1963) consisted of many satirical vignettes of Arab Communists of his acquaintance. His memoirs (Mudhakkirat Najati Sidqi: The memoirs of Najati Sidqi), edited by Hanna Abu Hanna, were published in Beirut in 2001. Analysis of the incompatibility of Islam with Nazism From his Soviet years, Sidqi was primarily interested in the problem of how one might bring about the transformation of Muslim societies into modern industrialised countries without damaging their traditional social fabric. In his 1940 work \\"The Islamic Traditions and the Nazi Principles: Can They Agree/Do They Match?\\" (al-TaqƒÅlid al-islƒÅmiyya wa-l- mabƒÅdi æ al-nƒÅziyya: hal tattafiqƒÅn?), published in early May of that year, Sidqi argued that Nazism was not only diametrically opposed to Islam, and that there could be no accommodation of the Islamic world to the kind of world advocated by Nazi Germany, but that indeed Nazism was antagonistic to Islam. The interaction of the two could only end in a zero-sum game. He thus declares that: > There is no doubt that the spirit of Islam is totally antithetical, in each > and every aspect, to all the principles of Nazism: the political regime, > society, family, economic, education and personal freedom. Though Sidqi took a distinctive approach - he was not a typical Islamic thinker - his book's argument was not unique but reflected a widespread trend in Arab rejections of Nazism. His polemic was based on a thorough familiarity with Hitler's Mein Kampf, the writings of Alfred Rosenberg, and broadcasts of Nazi propaganda by Joseph Goebbels. He compares the ideological material in these sources with Islamic classical texts ranging from the Qur'an and the Hadith collections to modern writings, including works by Muhammad Abduh, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani and Mustafa Kamil. The fundamental element that renders Nazism not only incompatible with, but inimical to, Islam, Sidqi argued, lies in the former's concept of racism (al-'un·π£uriyya/al-'irqiyya). Nazism was wedded to the idea of German racial purity and dedicated to weeding out or destroying \\"inferior\\" races, among which the Jews, and then the Russians, Negroes, Arabs, Egyptians, and Turks were classified. Nazi imperialism demanded a Lebensraum/masƒÅ·∏•a ·∏•ayyawiyya, and sought to conquer territory for Greater Germany. Islam, to the contrary, was devoid of racist feelings: Muslims enjoyed only one advantage over others, the worship of the Creator, which affirms that \\"all the believers are brothers\\". Glossing over an Islamic perception that Islam is a superior religion, something which both Judaism and Christianity have also claimed, he insists that Islam is tolerant. Islam, like the sister monotheisms, is universal, and revolutionary. \\"Judaism was a revolution against the Pharaohs, Christianity was a revolution against Roman injustice and Islam was a revolution to abolish ignorance:jƒÅhiliyya. Only faith, not blood, soil or race, informs Islam's notion of man's essential identity.\\" Whereas Nazism is materialistic, bestial and pagan, and accentuates the physical sensual nature of man, Islam embodies, for Sidqi, the ideational human side. The function of Nazism is therefore to extirpate what is spiritual in order to prioritise the supremacy of animalistic materialism. The one constitutes a real revolution (thawra), Nazism sows disobedience (i·π£yƒÅn) and plunges man back into the degraded pagan state of bestial idolatrous ignorance, which would effectively lead to 'social barbarism' (al-hamijiyya al-'ijtimƒÅ'iyya). The attack on Judaism in Nazism, he warned, was by the same token, an assault on both Christianity and Islam. Islam's institution of consultation (al-sh≈´rƒÅ) was what made it disposed to accept the idea of modern democracy, with its guarantee of freedom. Sidqi distinguished two kinds of imperialism: the classical, somewhat aged form of colonialism practiced by the English, French and Dutch, and German imperialism (ak-isti'mƒÅr al-almƒÅnƒ´). The former recognized that the nations they occupied were destined to achieve independence, whereas Nazi imperialism was using unprecedented violence to annihilate smaller nations. A Nazi takeover of Islamic countries would lead only to the people's enslavement ('ub≈´diyya), as it had in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Force, which in Islam was directed against the ignorant who refused the enlightenment of monotheism, had, in Nazism, assumed a cultic value, as an end in itself, directed towards the subjection of people both within territories Germany controlled and beyond. Nazism's Arabic broadcasts with their anti-Semitic propaganda were designed to incite Arabs to turn upon their own minorities. Muslims the world over must, he concluded, back the fight against Nazism, as indeed hundreds of thousands already were (Indians and Arabs) in combating 'shoulder to shoulder with English, French, Polish and Czech soldiers'. Such support was anchored in three principles: a shared respect for democracy, a cultural affinity with democratic nations, and the aspiration for independence at war's end. Nazism also was endeavouring to create a new religion (diyƒÅna), presenting Hitler as a sacred figure, a prophet, to whom blind obedience was owed, and the soul of the believer in this false religion thereby dwarfed. It preached a satanic message (risƒÅla shaytƒÅniyya) and, under the F√ºhrer's leadership, Nazism was laying siege to 'the fortress of science and civilization'. In an appendix he made a detailed critique of the memorandum delivered by Egypt's Wafd Party to the British Ambassador Miles Lampson in April 1940 which outlined stringent conditions to be attached to any Egyptian contribution to the British war effort. The memorandum had been promptly rejected by Viscount Halifax. Sidqi criticized Mustafa el-Nahhas for an inept reading of the growing threat from Hitler and Mussolini's forces, and called on Egypt to assume its historic responsibilities by siding with 'the two noble peoples of England and France'. He conceded that while it was true that both England and France were colonial powers in the Arab world, with possessions and mandates respectively in Mandatory Palestine, Aden, Egypt and Sudan, Syria and Lebanon, the anti- colonial struggle had to await the outcome of the war, and Muslims must mobilise to ensure that these two powers came out victors in the conflict. He argued for this notwithstanding the fact that he himself had, in his recollections, been persecuted by the French, and did not enjoy good relations with the British.
