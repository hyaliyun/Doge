His charitable donations at the end of his life resulted in a lawsuit between his family and the charity.  Early life.  Sheidy was born in Marietta, Pennsylvania in 1833. In 1841, the family moved to Republic, Ohio. As a young man, Sheidy, worked in carriage manufacturing. In 1871, Sheidy and his three brothers started a sheep business in South Texas, but it later evolved into a successful livestock business. In 1876, after their mother's death, the brothers relocated their company, the Sheidley Cattle Company, to Kansas City. Sheidy started investing extensively in Kansas City real estate. He held stock in the Kansas City Cable Company, and was part owner of an original Kansas City Streetcar. Scheidy also developed several commercial properties in the city.  Later life  Sheidy suffered strokes in 1890 and 1894 that totally disabled him. In March 1894, however, he pledged $25,000 to the Kansas City Public Library for purchasing books and sent them the first payment of $5,000. In October 1894, his family successfully peititioned a local court to have Sheidy declared insane. - his sister Sarah became his legal guardian. After Sarah Sheidy became legal guardian, she refused to pay the Library. At the end of 1894, the board of education sued her. The board won the case, primarily because Sheidley had established a reputation for generosity during his lifetime; the court ruled that giving to the public library was something that he would have done in sound mind. Sheidley died of a stroke in 1896.

The listing included 106 contributing buildings. It includes some works by architect John Gaw Meem, and works by notable artists if not certified architects. The district is in the southeast corner of Santa Fe, to the south of the Santa Fe River, and extends south of the Acequia Madre (Mother Ditch). It consists mostly of north-south streets. It adjoins the National Register-listed Santa Fe Historic District to the north and west. It is roughly bounded by the Acequia Madre, Camino del Monte Sol, El Caminito, and Garcia St. Its significance was described in its 1987 National Register nomination: > Beginning in the years following New Mexican statehood in 1912, and > continuing until World War II, this district was the center of a nationally > known colony of artists, a remarkable group of multi-talented, creative > people, many of whom had national reputations before settling in a remote > and little known region of the country.

The majority of the rebel zamindars were from South Bihar and were likely pushed to revolt due to the recurring droughts which hampered their revenue collections. Causes Ever since the British acquired Bihar after the Battle of Buxar, many of the zamindars had been causing troubles for the administration by withholding revenue or participating in looting. The British therefore had to take expeditions to bring them back under control. Among the zamindars causing disturbances prior to the revolt were Jugal Kishore of Bettiah Raj which was one of the largest estates in Bihar. After the Battle of Buxar, JWF James noted that the zamindars had become \\"restless\\". Following Chait Singh's rebellion in 1781 in Varanasi, many of the zamindars in Bihar used this as an opportunity to regain their autonomy. This was seen as an attempt to take advantage of the sudden challenge to British power. The revolt The zamindar of Huseypur, Fateh Bahadur Sahi had prior to 1781, been waging a guerrilla warfare campaign against the East India Company after being deposed from his estate. Taking advantage of Chait Singh's revolt, he decided to increase the frequency of his raids and met the British forces in a pitched battle accompanied by 20,000 of his own men. However his forces were eventually routed and he was killed in battle. The zamindar of Seris-Kutumba in Aurangabad, Raja Narain Singh, had also had a tradition of rebelling and joined Fateh Sahi's revolt. He had been remiss in providing his revenue payments. He had gathered a force of 15,000 soldiers and joined with allies of Chait Singh including Bachu Singh. His rebellion was swiftly put down by John Crawfurd and he was jailed. He was restored to his \\"forfeited\\" zamindari in 1790 after his release. He had assisted other zamindars with resources and was in secret correspondence with others in an attempt to stir up anti-British sentiment before his arrest. Raja Akbar Ali of the Mayi clan controlled the Narhat and Samoy estates in modern-day Gaya district also took part in the rebellion. He had previously been arrested in Patna for owing large unpaid revenue to the British. His estate had been badly affected by the Great Bengal famine of 1770. Akbar Ali likely viewed revolt as the best method of escaping the payment of his arrears. He was able to raise a body of 4000 matchlock men and they murdered a servant of the company by the name of Hotchiss. This was followed by a period of plundering in the region however he was forced to retreat by the EIC's Captain Powell. He also laid waste to neighbouring zamindaris but eventually, he was forced to flee to Delhi and his zamindari was confiscated. Aftermath The British were able to put down the revolt without too much trouble given the disorganised approach of the rebels. In the aftermath, the British were able to reassert their control of the region and install loyal zamindars in place of the ones that had been deposed. These new zamindars could be relied upon to provide revenue when required. The revolt itself, however, could be seen as a signal of the discontent in Bihar towards the British that later reemerged in the 1857 Rebellion.

He then joined another Cork club, Sundays Well, where his performances saw him join the Munster squad ahead of the 1998‚Äì99 season, going on to play in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final defeat against English side Northampton Saints and again in the inaugural final of the [Celtic league final]in 2001 defeat against Leinster.

O'Neill scored a try in the corner to win the game but it was disallowed by the referee, who had judged that the ball had gone into touch before O'Neill grounded it. Despite television replays proving that O'Neill had in fact scored a legitimate try, the video evidence could not be used, as it was only available in the Six Nations at the time. The try would have given Munster the win, but instead Stade hung on for the victory. O'Neill was called up to the Ireland squad that toured new Zealand in 2002]Ireland rugby union tour of New Zealand2002] but he never won any international caps.

He was the first director of music at the British Broadcasting Company, and pioneered techniques for broadcasting live music.  Early life  Jefferies was born at Weston-super-Mare on 4 September 1896, and studied organ and piano at the Royal College of Music. His studies were interrupted by World War I, when he served as a naval telegraphist. From 1919 to 1921, he was organist and music director at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great, in the City of London.  Career  While employed by Marconi, he was appointed, in around June 1922, to Marconi's experimental station 2LO, the British Broadcasting Company's forerunner, to be responsible for concerts broadcast from Marconi House, under the management of Arthur Burrows. By the end of that year, 2LO had been absorbed into the nascent British Broadcasting Company. He was its first director of music. He continued to work for the BBC after it became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927. While at the BBC, Jefferies made broadcasts in which he gave organ recitals and conducted orchestral performances. He composed music for Children's Hour programmes, on which he played the character of Uncle Jeff, and undertook the role of what would now be called a continuity announcer. Another of his duties was to build a collection of music recordings, which became the BBC Music Library. He was responsible for the appointment, in 1923, of Cecil Dixon as the BBC's first accompanist, the two having become acquainted at the Royal College of Music. Famously, the director of the BBC, John Reith, was once entertaining the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Randall Davidson, who expressed a love of piano music. Reith telephoned the BBC's headquarters, and within minutes, Jefferies was playing Schubert's Marche Militaire, live on air. In 1924, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a series of concerts at the Central Hall, Westminster. However, in 1926, having realised that his opportunities to progress as a musician and conductor were limited, he moved to a more technical role, responsible for the quality of broadcasts. Jefferies left the BBC in June 1935, after further career disappointments, despite support from Adrian Boult. Following military service in World War II (he received an emergency commission as a lieutenant on 20 November 1940), he returned to the BBC as a producer, continuing in the latter role until at least 1956. He retired formally from the BBC that year, though he continued to undertake some work for them until the next year. In October 1935, shortly after leaving the BBC \\"with much regret\\", he published a three-part reminiscence of his radio work, \\"Soap Box Days\\", in the magazine Popular Wireless. He was a Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music (L.R.A.M.).  Legacy  Jefferies developed new techniques for positioning microphones and controlling sound levels for broadcasting an orchestra, a subject he named \\"balance and control\\"; he wrote about this, and more, in The Radio Times, and it was extensively covered in a 1984 PhD thesis presented to the University of Leicester. Its author, Geoff Matthews, observed: Jefferies working methods are also described in two autobiographical volumes by his BBC colleague Cecil Lewis: Broadcasting From Within (1924) and Don't Look Back (1974).  Personal life  Jefferies died on 22 October 1961, aged 65. His wife, the singer and radio actor Vivienne Chatterton, survived him. In the 1930s, they had a cottage at Lyme Regis.

He is best known for his two published collections of short stories Hings and HWFG. Background McQueer was brought up in the East End of Glasgow. He worked in a sports shop and as a crime scene cleaner before becoming a full- time writer. He supports Celtic Football Club. Writing Career He began his writing career by self-publishing short stories on Twitter. His first book collection, Hings, was published in 2017 and was compiled from his Twitter stories. It won Best Short Story Collection at the 2018 Saboteur Awards. The success of Hings allowed McQueer to give up his job in order to write full time. It was followed by 2018's HWFG (which stands for Here We Fucking Go), and was McQueer's first collection of stories to be written specifically for book publication. After being dissatisfied with his initial efforts, which he felt too closely resembled the style of Hings, he consciously adopted a darker tone. He has subsequently begun work on his first novel. McQueer also gives regular spoken word performances of his stories. In 2019, some of the stories from Hings were adapted as a three-part series of short films for BBC iPlayer. McQueer himself appears as the series' narrator. Writing Style McQueer's work, which is written in naturalistic Glaswegian Scots and English, has a darkly humorous style that has been compared to that of Limmy and Irvine Welsh.

Life Prim was born in the city of Kilkenny to John Henry Prim, a lawyer and Johanna Anderson. He had three brothers and four sisters. Prim had eight children with Mary McCrea, the daughter of the founder of the Moderator, Abraham Denroche. He was a reporter at the Kilkenny Moderator, and editor from 1855 to the end of his life. Since childhood he had a fascination with archeology and wrote accounts of the archaeological sites throughout County Kilkenny. He planned to write the history of the county. Prim had begun transcribing from medieval manuscripts, collecting Irish ballads, and also planned to publish the songs of the county. He had a relationship with Se√°n √ì D√°laigh and S√©amus √ì Braon√°in to collect songs in Irish in their areas. Kilkenny Archaeological Society The Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland was founded in 1849 as the Kilkenny Archaeological Society, by a group of young men with archaeological and historical interests who were based in the Kilkenny area. Prim and his cousin, James Graves, were the first two Honorary General Secretaries. They had had an interest in Kilkenny antiquities from their youngest days, when they had rambled as far afield as Kilfane Church to see the famous tomb sculpture of Cantwell Fada. Prim had begun transcribing from medieval manuscripts, while Graves had been making sketches of the ancient monasteries of the vicinity. In 1869 the society was granted a Royal Charter, and in 1890 it moved to Dublin, changing its name to the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, becoming in 1891, according to its Honorary Secretary Robert Cochrane, \\"not only the largest Antiquarian Society in Great Britain and Ireland, but also the largest in the world\\".

She wears a circular collar and a wide skirt hangs from her cosseted waist. A nosegay keeps her hair out of her eye. She carries a fruit basket in her left arm and a bouquet of flowers in her right hand, hinting at her interest in gardening and produce growing for the Cape refreshment station. There is no reasonably confirmed image of Maria de la Queillerie from her lifetime. The sculptor, Dirk Wolbers, is said to have therefore used his own wife as a model, in what was to be the last sculpture of his career. It was cast in bronze in Paris.

In 1885, Waugh joined the Levant Consular Service as a student interpreter. He saw service in Albania, where Turkish authority was on the wane, and in Turkish Kurdistan soon after the Hamidian massacres. Waugh was appointed vice-consul at Constantinople in March 1900. When Turkey joined the Central Powers, Waugh remained in Turkey at the American Embassy to protect British interests, the British representatives having left the country. In 1915 he was recalled to the Foreign Office in London before being sent to Athens as Britain‚Äôs commercial attach√© where he was put in charge of the Contraband Department to control Greek trade during World War I. After the armistice, he was sent back to Constantinople where his experience and contacts made him a useful member of staff at the British High Commission to implement the terms of the armistice. He was later appointed Consul-General in Constantinople. Waugh was appointed CMG in 1919 and KCMG on retirement. Waugh was the first cousin of Arthur Waugh and the uncle of Evelyn Waugh.

Visitors to Leeds and other museums in West Yorkshire contributed ¬£34 million to the regional economy over the same time period. In 2001, a review of the service found that museum learning could be far more central to its offer. The service recently developed the 'Leeds Curriculum', teaching materials for schools,'The cultural history of the city is now at teachers' fingertips', Yorkshire Evening Post (18 June 2018). which was awarded 'Educational Iniative of the Year' by the Museums & Heritage Awards. History Leeds Museums & Galleries began life as the museum of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society, which opened in 1821. In 1921, the collection was purchased by Leeds Corporation, to continue as a municipal museum (Leeds City Museum). In 1928, Abbey House Museum was purchased by the Leeds Corporation, as place to display social history. Kirkstall Abbey transferred to the museum service at this time. In 1941 the museum was bombed and parts of the collections were destroyed. In 1982 Leeds Industrial Museum opened to the public, with Blue Peter presenters as guests of honour. In 1990 Thwaite Mills opened as a museum. In 2007 Leeds Discovery Centre opened as a display store where the public can visit the collections 'behind the scenes'. Meanwhile, Leeds Art Gallery had been founded in 1888 by public subscription. In 1921, Leeds City Council purchased Temple Newsam House as an additional venue for the arts, recognizing its historic value. These art venues were added to in 1969, with the gift of Lotherton Hall to the people of Leeds. In 1996 the two services combined to form Leeds Museums & Galleries. Collections Its collections comprise approximately 1.3 million objects: * Natural Science - over 800,000 globally collected specimens including taxidermy, herbaria, conchology, geology, entomology and wet material. * Archaeology & Numismatics - worldwide collection of historical and pre- historical material including large numismatics holdings. * dress and textiles - predominantly British collection including a large amount of garments relating to the tailoring industry in Leeds. * Fine Art - the collection has particular strengths in the areas of 18th and early 19th century English watercolours, 20th century British Art and a modern sculpture collection more extensive than any other regional gallery in the UK. *Industrial History - Leeds's industrial collections comprise tools, machinery, industrial products, archive ephemera, photographs and other personal records. * Social History - this collection is particularly significant in the areas of childhood toys and games, retailing history, domestic life, musical instruments, slot machines and automata and printed ephemera. * World Cultures - this is a significant collection area for Leeds, with over 12,000 items demonstrating the city‚Äôs historic links to the wider world, and the multicultural vibe of contemporary arts and culture. * Decorative Art - these collections can be linked to local crafts people past and present, and features major collections of furniture, ceramics, wallpapers, modern crafts, metalwork, textiles and costume. Four collection areas are Designated by Arts Council England to have national or international importance, these are: Decorative Art, Fine Art, Industrial Heritage and Natural Science. They are regularly consulted by researchers, on subjects as diverse as: the genetic history of the thylacine, Roman forks, back-to-back housing, body height of mummified pharaohs and thylacine pouches. The service still adds to its collections, for example through acquiring new archaeological archives. Nesyamun, on display at Leeds City Museum is a widely studied Egyptian priest. The First World War program, which ran from 2014‚Äì18, examined how Leeds was affected by the First World War, worked with people across the city.Chris Burn, 'How army of people helped Leeds remember war that changed the world', Yorkshire Evening Post (31 January 2019). =Internal Research= Staff and volunteers undertake research on sites and collections, recent publications include: *'The Leeds Pals Handbook' (2018) *'Gender and Natural Science Collections in Museums' (2017) *'Wallpapers at Temple Newsam: 1635 to the Present' (2017) *'Great War Britain: Leeds' (2015) = External Research= As well as staff and volunteers researching the sites and collections, the service has partnered on several research projects.

Born in Islington, Binks' father died when Eddie was only six years old, and he was later brought up by an aunt and uncle. He left school around the age of thirteen and became an office clerk, then when he was sixteen moved to work with the Midland Railway at Walthamstow, acting as a weighbridge clerk. He worked in a variety of jobs for the company, around London, before becoming a checker at St Pancras Goods Station. In 1913, the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) was founded, and Binks was elected as assistant secretary of its Kentish Town branch, the union's largest branch. In 1922, he was elected to the Local Department Committee and the Sectional Council, and in 1925 he became the branch secretary, also winning election to the union's executive. As early as 1933 he was nominated as the union's president, and he served as chair and then secretary of the employees' side of Council No.4. He eventually won the post of President of the NUR in 1945, serving a three-year term. As president, he led a union delegation to the Soviet Union, represented the union at numerous international conferences, and argued for a single union of railway workers, and the nationalisation of the British railways. His term also saw the election of a Labour Party government, and Binks was strongly supportive, winning election to the party's National Executive Committee. At the 1931 London County Council election, Binks stood for the Labour Party in St Pancras South East, but was not elected. However, in 1941 he was appointed to the council as an alderman, serving until 1946. When his term of office ended, Binks found work with the goods section at Broad Street railway station, then with the Railway Executive, where he co-ordinated goods traffic around London. In 1955, he was a founder member of the Southern Area Board, and he also served on its successor, the Southern Railway Board.

He was an advocate for the political and economic growth of Mexican-Americans and Latinos. Barreto Sr. was a founder of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) and served as part of President Ronald Reagan's transition team.  Early life  Barreto Sr. was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, on August 23, 1935. Although he could have attended college, Barreto dropped out high school his junior year. By age 16, he worked alongside his father as a livestock dealer, where he was earning about $200 a day. He eventually began his own business, but by the age of 17, he lost it all. In 1958, Barreto immigrated to the United States where he worked in agriculture picking potatoes in a farm near Corning, Missouri. In 1960, Barreto married Mary Louise Tejeda, and settled in Independence, Missouri. In order to support his growing family, Barreto worked two jobs: one working in a meatpacking house in Kansas City, Kansas, and the second laying tracks for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Despite working as a manual laborer, he never lost his entrepreneur spirit. Barreto visited numerous banks in hopes of obtaining a loan to open a restaurant, yet banks rejected his applications citing he had \\"no track record\\" of being a businessman. After 10 rejections, Barreto decided to borrow a $5,000 high interest home improvement loan to open his restaurant. In 1966, Barreto and his wife opened Independence's first Mexican Restaurant Mexico Lindo. Barreto immigrated to the US in his early twenties, and started working as a potato digger on a farm in Missouri. He then moved to Kansas City, where he worked as a school custodian and in a packinghouse to save money to open a restaurant. With his wife, Mary Louise Tejeda Barreto, he opened Mexico Lindo Restaurant in 1966 in Independence, MO. eventually, he owned three more restaurants, a title company, and a construction firm in Kansas City. He noticed that other Hispanic business owners had disadvantages in the Kansas City area, so in 1978 he formed the Kansas City Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 1978 with other Hispanic business owners. The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) was inspired by this effort; it was incorporated in New Mexico in 1979. Barreto was the first president of the USHCC, which was originally based in Kansas City. He was named Chairman Emeritus of the organization, and is a member of the League of United Latin American Citizen's Hall of Fame. The USHCC has a scholarship fund named in his honor. Barreto worked as an adviser on Latino perspectives for Carter, Reagan, and the first Bush administration. He became a part of Reagan's \\"kitchen cabinet\\". His son, Hector Barreto Jr., was the administrator of the Small Business Administration under George W. Bush.  Death  Hector Barreto Sr. died on May 14, 2004, in his hometown of Guadalajara, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. After his death, the USHCC Foundation established a scholarship fund in his honor.

Methodology  Just-in- time learning is different from structured training or scheduled professional development, both of which are generally available at set dates and times. What makes just-in-time learning unique is a strategy focussed on meeting the learner's need when it arises, rather than pre-scheduled education sessions that occur regardless of the immediacy or scope of need. Therefore, planning for just-in-time learning requires anticipating what is needed by the various learners, when and where they may be when they experience the need, and the creation of content oriented toward meeting those needs in ways that are focused and accessible. The learning that is provided in a just-in-time format is often by short online videos, targeted elearning, printed and accessible job aids, or related real-world information. It is timed and packaged to meet one explicit need and nothing else, so as not to overwhelm the learner with anything that does not meet the immediate need. Information can be provided through traditional paper, online, or through mobile devices depending upon need and availability. It is essential that the information is findable and understandable by the person who needs it; otherwise the person will become distracted or lose focus and defeats the benefits of just-in-time learning. Meeting only the immediate need helps with knowledge retention and promotes feelings of empowerment. Therefore, one of the criteria used to assess learning is the speed of connecting the person who needs something with the learning that helps get it done.  Success criteria  That just-in-time learning is often conflated with reusable learning objects implies that similar success criteria may be applied to them. Evidence of successful use of just-in-time learning includes higher learner satisfaction, decreased costs, and even increased patient-centered outcomes when implemented within health settings.

He died of broncho-pneumonia on December 30, 1918, while serving in Russia. Early life The son of the five-term mayor of Sutton, Quebec, Leon C. Dyer, Royce Coleman Dyer was born in Sutton on February 1, 1889. Before the war he worked as a butcher. World War I Dyer enlisted on September 23, 1914, in Valcartier, Qu√©bec and was assigned to the 8th Bn, Canadian Infantry (Manitoba Regiment), the 'Black Devils'. He participated in a number of WWI battles during his service, including the Second Battle of Ypres. During the Battle of Mont Sorrel his actions earned him the Military Medal. During this action he was gassed. After losing consciousness he was found in a ditch two days later, then spent the next month in hospital. After being promoted to Sergeant, he was hospitalized after breaking a rib during the Battle of the Somme, and again knocked out of action after getting a bullet in the torso. North Russia intervention While recovering in England from his bullet wound, he was approached about joining the Special Service Force that was being sent to assist anti-Bolshevik forces near Archangel, Russia as part of the Allied North Russia intervention. He attracted the attention of the unit's commander General Edmund Ironside after his actions while taking the village of Onega, for which he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal. =Dyer's Battalion= General Ironside needed more men for his Russian occupation force and so looked to recruit local Russians. When enrollment figures came up short he took the suggestion of one of his staff and looked to recruit criminals from the local prisons. Called the Slavo-British Allied Legion (SBAL) he assigned their training to Dyer, who was promoted to Lieutenant. With British, Australian and Canadian officers Dyer created a unit of just under three hundred ex-prisoners. The men viewed their Lieutenant with much respect and took to calling themselves ‚ÄúDyer‚Äôs Battalion.‚Äù Encouraged by the progress of the unit Allied Russian command promoted Dyer to Captain. During training, disaster struck when he died from broncho-pneumonia. The unit never recovered but to show their respect the men carried around a huge portrait of Dyer when marching, as is the Eastern Orthodox tradition of an Icon. With their namesake dead, morale in the Battalion plummeted. Dyer had resisted enlisting suspected Bolsheviks but after his death, high command ignored this and many imprisoned Russian Bolsheviks were added to the unit. When the unit was moved to the front lines tensions grew and on July 7, 1919, the men murdered their officers. The mutineers then ordered the soldiers to cross enemy lines and join the Bolsheviks. Death While serving in Russia Dyer became ill and on December 27, 1918, he was admitted to the 82nd Casualty Clearing Station in Bakharitza suffering from fever. The medics there diagnosed his ailment as broncho- pneumonia, then a deadly disease, which he died from three days later, on December 30, 1918. Enlisting in 1914 and dying long after World War I had ended, he was one of the first Canadians to volunteer and the last to die. He is buried at Archangel Allied Cemetery.

The summit was due to be held in mid-2011, but was postponed because of the ill-health of Hugo Ch√°vez, president of the host nation, Venezuela. The summit was instead held on December 2 and 3, 2011 in Caracas. It primarily focused on the global economic crisis and its effects on the region. Several leaders, including presidents Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, Dilma Rousseff and Juan Manuel Santos, encouraged an increase in regional trade, economic development, and further economic cooperation among members in order to defend their growing economies. Chavez, and other leaders such as Rafael Correa and Daniel Ortega, expressed hope that the bloc would work to further Latin American integration, end U.S. hegemony and consolidate control over regional affairs. Chavez, citing the Monroe Doctrine as the original confirmation of U.S. interference in the region, openly called for CELAC to replace the OAS: \\"As the years go by, CELAC is going to leave behind the old and worn-out OAS.\\" Correa called for a new human rights commission to replace the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Other leaders argued that the organisation should be used as a tool to resolve regional disagreements and uphold democratic values, but not as a replacement of the OAS. Santos stated that he would like to see dialogue within the group over whether existing counter-drug regulations should be revised. The president of the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) said he expects that Parlatino will become the main legislative institution of CELAC.

McKillip. It was first published in hardcover and ebook by Ace Books in December 2010, with a book club edition issued simultaneously with the Science Fiction Book Club and a trade paperback edition following December 2011. The first British edition was published in ebook by Gateway/Orion in December 2015. Summary The book is set in a culture reminiscent of the medieval era, but technologically near- modern, and in which archaeology is also an established profession. Scholar Phelan Cle of the Bardic School at Caerau chooses as his graduate thesis the subject of the perhaps mythical Bone Plain, where all poetry is said to have originated, and the tale of the wandering bard Nairn. Meanwhile, archaeologist Jonah Cle, Phelan's alcoholic father, pursues his own investigations, urged on by his dedicated disciple Princess Beatrice, the king's youngest daughter. At the standing stones near the school is unearthed a strange artifact, a disk marked with ancient runes that may prove key to the mysteries of Bone Plain. Beatrice soon discovers indications of the lost language it represents everywhere. Alternating chapters recount the activities of the Cles and the princess and the legend of Nairn, and gradually the present and past are revealed to mirror each other and ultimately fuse. Reception In a starred review, Publishers Weekly calls the novel \\"a rich, resonant story of poetry, riddles, mystery, and magic. ... McKillip seduces readers with lyrical prose; intriguing, complex characters; and resonant riddles-within-riddles.\\"Review in Publishers Weekly v. 257, iss. 42, Oct. 25, 2010, pp. 34-35. Jackie Cassada in Library Journal also gives the book a starred review, decreeing it a \\"masterfully told tale by an author sensitive to nuance and detail [that] will please McKillip's many fans,\\" writing that her \\"finely tuned feel for the mythic aspects of stories informs her fantasies with the underpinnings of archetypal power, yet her characters remain endearingly human, with recognizable flaws and strengths.\\"Cassada, Jackie. Review in Library Journal v. 135, iss. 20, Dec. 2010, p. 107. Rebecca Gerber in Booklist writes that \\"[r]eaders already familiar with the author will enjoy a fascinating tale of music and bards, legends and reality, and, most of all‚Äîmagic. For those exposed to McKillip for the first time, a treasure awaits them in the pages of this story. ...

It is the ninth installment in the Saw film series and stars Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 21, 2021, by Lionsgate, after being delayed from its original release date of May 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Synopsis  Lionsgate's officially released synopsis reads: \\"Working in the shadow of an esteemed police veteran (Samuel L. Jackson), brash detective Ezekiel \\"Zeke\\" Banks (Chris Rock) and his rookie partner William Schenk (Max Minghella) take charge of a grisly investigation into murders that are eerily reminiscent of the city's gruesome past. Unwittingly trapped in a deepening mystery, Zeke finds himself at the center of the killer's morbid game.\\"  Cast  * Chris Rock as Det. Ezekiel \\"Zeke\\" Banks * Samuel L. Jackson as Marcus Banks * Max Minghella as Det. William Schenk * Marisol Nichols as Capt. Angie Garza * Zoie Palmer as Kara Boswick  Production  = Development = According to Chris Rock, the origins of Spiral came from a chance meeting with the head of Lionsgate at a friend's wedding, and felt doing something in the horror genre would be a new avenue to take his career, though planned to include some comedic elements in the film. Rock approached Lionsgate with his ideas of extending the franchise, who became very interested in the concept. Lionsgate's CEO Joe Drake said that Rock's idea was \\"completely reverential to the legacy of the material while reinvigorating the brand with his wit, creative vision and passion for this classic horror franchise\\". By January 2018, industry rumors had said that Lionsgate had begun discussions of a ninth Saw film, for which The Spierig Brothers would not be returning. By April 2018, Twisted Pictures was reported to be developing a sequel with Jigsaw writers Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger. On May 16, 2019, the film was officially in production. Former series director Darren Lynn Bousman returned to helm the film, along with series veterans Mark Burg and Oren Koules as producers. Rock was involved as an executive producer, in addition to writing the story treatment. Joining Rock as executive producers included the original Saw creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell, along with Daniel Heffner. Stolberg and Goldfinger were affirmed as scriptwriters. With the announcement, Rock stated, \\"I've been a fan of Saw since the first film in 2004. I am excited by the opportunity to take this to a really intense and twisted new place.\\" Burg and Koules said that Rock's treatment of Saw was comparable to what Eddie Murphy had done for buddy cop films in 48 Hrs., giving the Saw series a \\"completely fresh perspective\\". Stolberg later confirmed that the ninth installment will exist in the same canon as the previous eight films, and will not be a reboot, nor will it be a direct sequel to Jigsaw. = Filming = On July 8, 2019, filming commenced in Toronto under the working title of The Organ Donor. Rock, Samuel L. Jackson, Max Minghella, and Marisol Nichols were announced to be starring in the film. Lionsgate's CEO Joe Drake stated, \\"We think Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Rock along with Max Minghella and Marisol Nichols make this film completely special in the Saw canon and we can't wait to unleash this unexpected and sinister new story on fans of this franchise. This is next level of Saw on full tilt.\\" On August 28, 2019, filming officially wrapped.  Marketing  The film was known under the working title The Organ Donor until the name Spiral: From the Book of Saw was leaked to the press on January 22, 2020, along with Mongrel Media as the Canadian distributor. The first teaser poster and trailer, released on February 5, 2020, confirmed Spiral as the title of the film.  Release  Spiral is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 21, 2021, by Lionsgate. The film was originally scheduled to be released on October 23, 2020, but was moved up to May 15, 2020. The film was later delayed to its current release date, taking the previous spot of John Wick: Chapter 4, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

() is a Brazilian travel documentary television series that premiered on GloboNews on July 26, 2015. The series features Andr√© Fran, Felipe UFO, Michel Coeli and Rodrigo Cebrian who explores various countries, cultures and their social, political and economic issues. Episodes =Season 1: Kurdistan (2015)= In the first season, over the 15 days of travel, Andr√© Fran, Felipe UFO and Michel Coeli witnessed important issues in the history of the Kurds. The journey began in Turkey, which concentrates the largest Kurdish population, where the team witnessed a historic moment: the first time the Kurdish minority elected representatives to the Parliament in Ankara. In a campaign marked by tension, the result of the election led a multitude to the streets of the unofficial capital of the Turkish Kurdistan. The trio leave Turkey towards Iraq. On the overland journey, they face two bureaucratic hours to leave Turkey and get into Iraq. They were the first Brazilians to enter Kurdistan without an Iraqi visa, following the rule that went on February, 2015 and the initiative of the Honorary consul of Brazil in the region. Once in Iraq, they follow by car to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, on a journey of 2 hours and a half. They opt for an alternate path, a little longer, to avoid the city of Mossul, one of the capitals of the so- called Islamic State. Andr√©, Felipe and Michel are surprised by what they find in Erbil. The three were the only guests of a newly opened five-star hotel in Dohuk, a few kilometers from Mossul. The trio also visits a modern shopping center in the city and interview Dr. Safeen Sindi, the Brazilian consul in Kurdistan who talked about the situation in the area and the history of this virtually autonomous nation within Iraq. =Season 2: Africa (2016)= The season begins in Agbogbloshie, Ghana, the world's largest electronic waste site. The trio circulate through the landfill with environmental engineer Atiemo Sampson. In Senegal, the series followed on a long journey to the boundaries of the Sahara Desert to meet the Great Green Wall, an initiative of 11 African countries to try to curb the advance of the desert. The third episode focused on the combat of Ebola, chikungunya, and Zika in Africa. The trio interviewed Dr. Amadou Sall, an infectious disease physician. In Kenya, they went to meet one of the rose-producing farms that are an important part of the economy and one of the country's major exports to Europe. =Season 3: United States (2016)= In the first episode, the team (now with the addition of Rodrigo Cebrian) divides into places with opposite proposals: Las Vegas, with all its ostentatious, and Black Rock Desert, where the Burning Man happens, a desert counter-culture festival that gathers 70000 people. In the following episodes, the team visits Cleveland and Detroit to check the results of a crisis in capitalism and to show how this model is reinventing itself with initiatives that unite technology and activism to rebuild cities. They also go to the American South to dive into the everyday life of a typical pro- gun family of Louisiana, one of the states with more weapons in circulation and with a large number of firearm-related death. =Season 4: Mexico (2017)= Andr√© Fran, Felipe Ufo, Michel Coeli and Rodrigo Cebrian traveled to Mexico and approached the illegal crossing into the United States. In the first episode, they show how is the life of those who embark in search of the American dream and, after getting the work visa, become prevented from returning to their country. On the border between Tijuana and San Diego, families refind themselves having a wall between them. In the second episode, they travel to Ciudad Ju√°rez and El Paso. In the third episode, the presenters go to Mexico City and present the place through the stories of corruption and wrestling. The season ends up making the opposite path and showing the Americans going to Mexico. First, in Los Algodones, where elderly Americans go in search of good quality medical care with lower costs. And then in Cancun, where Americans from all ages travel in search of alcohol, partying and fun.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced.

Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text.

In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

In 1846 11 families lived in the village, from 1885 an official school was established, which was closed again in 1935. Immediately after World War II 50 people still lived in Rockenfeld. Due to constant emigration, the local council decided to dissolve the community in 1965. In 1969 the abandoned houses and courtyards were burned down by the fire brigade.

Based on the results of the surveys, a set of harmonized economic indicators is calculated for all participating countries, typically used for analysis and short-term forecasting of economic developments, as well as economic research. Furthermore, the indicators lend themselves to detecting turning points in the business cycle and are a complement to official statistical data on economic developments, which are released with a significantly longer time-lag .  The programme in a nutshell  The European Union (EU) co-finances the implementation of business and consumer surveys in its Member States, as well as candidate countries. The recipient institutes commit to conducting monthly surveys among firms in selected economic sectors as well as consumers using a harmonised questionnaire and transmitting the results to the European Commission. The latter provides them to the public free of charge. Within the European Commission, the programme is managed by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN).  Sectoral coverage of the programme and sample size  The economic tendency surveys of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys are conducted in the following economic sectors (the exact sub-sectors covered, as well as the approximate EU-wide, monthly sample sizes are indicated in brackets): * Manufacturing (NACE 10‚Äì33; 40510 firms per month) * Construction (NACE 41‚Äì43, 22934 firms per month) * Retail trade (NACE 45+47, 31441 firms per month) * Services (NACE 49‚Äì96, 45989 firms per month) * Financial Services Sector (NACE 64‚Äì66, 1000 firms per month) * Consumers (41060 households per month) * Investment survey in the manufacturing survey (NACE 10‚Äì33, 47441 per half-year)  Harmonized questionnaire  The harmonised questionnaire of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys has been developed jointly with the OECD. Its questions refer to economic developments in recent months and at present, as well as the expected developments in the next months and are generally answered on a three-point (business surveys) / five-point (consumer survey) answering scale. Here are some examples from the harmonised business surveys: * How has your production developed over the past 3 months? It has increased / remained unchanged / decreased * Do you consider your current overall order books to be? More than sufficient (above normal) / sufficient (normal for the season) / not sufficient (below normal) * How do you expect your production to develop over the next 3 months? It will increase / remain unchanged / decrease Here are some examples from the harmonised consumer survey: * How has the financial situation of your household changed over the last 12 months? It has got a lot better / got a little better / stayed the same / got a little worse / got a lot worse / don't know * How do you expect the general economic situation in this country to develop over the next 12 months? It will get a lot better / get a little better / stay the same / get a little worse / get a lot worse / don't know * In view of the general economic situation, do you think that now it is the right moment for people to make major purchases such as furniture, electrical/electronic devices, etc.? Yes, it is the right moment now / it is neither the right moment nor the wrong moment / no, it is not the right moment now / don't know Besides the above types of questions, which inquire qualitative assessments, the harmonised questionnaire also contains a few questions capturing quantitative answers, e.g. the estimated rate of capacity utilisation of the responding firms or the inflation rate consumers expect for the near future. The only harmonised survey which consists to a large extent of quantitative questions is the bi-annual investment survey in the manufacturing survey. The complete questionnaire of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys can be accessed via the programme's dedicated User Guide. The national questionnaires designed on the basis of the harmonised questionnaire and used in the different EU Member States and candidate countries are available on the programme's website.https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators- statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/methodology- business-and-consumer-surveys/national-questionnaires_en National questionnaires  Methodology  To achieve comparability between countries, the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys is governed by two basic principles: * use by all national institutes of the same harmonised questionnaires, and * conduct of the national surveys, and transmission of the results, according to a common timetable. The national questionnaires may include additional questions, beyond the harmonised ones. However, in designing national questionnaires, priority must be given to ensuring high response rates for the harmonised EU questions. This implies that the harmonised questions shall precede any other questions. There are no binding criteria in respect of the sampling method and survey mode so that the actual implementation of the programme can take into account country-specific factors. To promote further harmonisation across countries, the Directorate- General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission, which manages the programme, has released a list of ‚Äòbest practice‚Äô for the conduct of business and consumer surveys in 2014. More details on the specific methodology applied in a given EU Member State or candidate country are available on the website of the programme.https://ec.europa.eu/info/business- economy-euro/indicators-statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer- surveys/methodology-business-and-consumer-surveys/metadata-partner- institutes_en Metadata of partner institutes  Data access  Based on the data submitted by the institutes participating in the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys, the European Commission calculates composite indicators aimed at tracking the evolution of the business cycle in specific sectors, as well as the overall economy. There is one composite indicator per surveyed sector, a so-called ‚Äòconfidence indicator‚Äô, as well as an economy-wide ‚ÄòEconomic Sentiment Indicator‚Äô (ESI), which summarises the information of the different sectoral confidence indices. The latest readings of the confidence indices and the Economic Sentiment Indicator are released by the European Commission in a monthly press releasehttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators- statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/download-business- and-consumer-survey-data/press-releases_en Press releases and analysed in some more depth in a dedicated quarterly publication (‚ÄòEuropean Business Cycle Indicators‚Äôhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/indicators- statistics/economic-databases/business-and-consumer-surveys/download-business- and-consumer-survey-data/press-releases_en). The historical, as well as the latest results of all harmonised surveys (Seasonal adjustment and non- seasonally adjusted) can be downloaded free of charge on the website of the programme. There are dedicated data-sets for each EU Member State and candidate country, as well as the euro area and the EU.

Historical development and legal base  The first harmonised survey of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys was conducted in manufacturing (1962) and followed by a harmonised survey in construction, as well as the harmonised investment survey in manufacturing in 1966. 1972 saw the introduction of the harmonised consumer survey before the programme was extended to retail trade in 1984 and the services sector in 1996. In 2007, the European Commission furthermore launched its financial services sector survey, which differs from the previous surveys in so far as it is conducted centrally, rather than by partner institutes in the respective EU Member State or candidate country. The legal base of the Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys is a Decision of the Commission of the European Economic Community of November 1961. The programme was subsequently modified through a number of Council and Commission decisions and last approved through Commission decision C(97) 2241 of 15 July 1997. Regular updates on the implementation of the programme in terms of use, methodology and coverage were presented in Commission communications COM(2000) 770 of 29 November 2000, COM(2006) 379 of 12 July 2006, SEC(2012) 227 of 4 April 2012 and C(2016) 6634 of 20 October 2016.  Financial Support  The European Commission supports the institutes conducting the harmonised surveys on its behalf with action grants, which are limited to a maximum of 50% of the total eligible costs of the surveys. These grants are designed to cover the costs associated with the adoption of the harmonised methodology. In 2017, 50 institutes we supported with a total amount of 5.4 million euros. The individual financial support ranged between 281 929 and 2 714 euros. Berichtsjahr: 2017, Suchbegriff: \\"JOINT HARMONISED EU PROGRAMME OF BUSINESS AND CONSUMER SURVEYS\\"  Institutes supported  The institutes receiving financial support for conducting the harmonised surveys range from ministries, statistical offices (e.g. Insee), central banks (e.g. Banque Nationale de Belgique), universities (e.g. University of Cyprus) and research institutes (e.g. Ifo and WIFO), to business associations (e.g. Confederation of Finnish Industries) and private companies (e.g. GfK or Ipsos).  Evaluation 2011/2012  The Joint Harmonised EU Programme of Business and Consumer Surveys was subject to an evaluation in 2011/12, which was commissioned by the European Commission and conducted jointly by Ghk Consulting Ltd. and DIW Berlin. The evaluation provided evidence of the programme's survey results regularly feeding into the political decision-making process and the strategic choices of private enterprises. The list of frequent users of the harmonised data ranges from various Directorates-General of the European Commission (including Eurostat), the European Central Bank, the OECD, national central banks and ministries, over public and private research institutes and universities, to private enterprises, their lobby organisations, financial institutes and the media. Users of the harmonised data typically use it to get an overview of the current economic situation, or as input for economic forecasts and nowcasts, as well as business cycle analyses.

She was an instructor at Wellesley College before joining the faculty of Stanford University, where she became the first full-time American professor of sociology. She later founded the sociology department of Mills College. Early life Coolidge was born Mary Elizabeth Burroughs Roberts in Kingsbury, Indiana, the daughter of Margaret Jane (n√©e Marr) and Isaac Phillips Roberts. Both of her parents were Indiana farmers who emigrated to Mount Pleasant, Iowa in 1862. Her father would go on to become Professor of Agriculture at the Iowa Agricultural College after 1869, then was offered a similar position at Cornell University in 1873. He later became Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and Director of the Experiment Station at Cornell. Mary matriculated to Cornell, graduating with a Ph.B. in 1880 and a M.S. in 1882. She was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.  Career  Mary Roberts taught at public and private schools from 1880 until 1886, then was an instructor with the Department of History at Wellesley College until 1890. During her last two years at Wellesley, she served as secretary for the Board of Examiners. On August 28, 1890, she was married to Albert W. Smith, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Cornell. In 1891, he was professor of machine design at the University of Wisconsin, while she, along with former student Clelia Duel Mosher, continued research on the sexual practices of college women. The couple moved to Stanford University, where Mary earned her Ph.D. in 1896. The same year she was named assistant professor and later associate professor at Stanford, becoming the first full-time American professor of sociology. The strain of a dual career family proved too much for the couple, and they were divorced in 1904. This painful event led to a mental breakdown and she had a brief stay at a sanitorium. The following year she tried to return to Stanford, but the University wouldn't rehire her. Instead, Roberts became a research assistant at the Carnegie Institution in Washington D.C. until 1907. Starting in 1905, she was a worker for the San Francisco Settlement Association's South Park Settlement ‚Äì a center of social welfare work for the city. However, this building was destroyed by the San Francisco Earthquake in 1906. It was a few months later in 1906 that she married a former student of hers, Dane Coolidge, a naturalist who would author a series of Western novels. The two would spend time on horseback trips together through the southwest, and she contributed her sociology training to his works. In 1909 she joined the Russell Sage Foundation, and had her work Chinese Immigration published, which was considered by some a \\"remarkable book for its time\\", coming as it did when the Chinese Exclusion Act was in full force. During 1910‚Äì1912, she served as president of the Settlement Council. Her work Why Women are so, a sociological study of whether attitudes toward middle-class women had shaped their behavior, was published in 1912. For many years following her breakdown that significantly reduced her eminence in the field, Roberts was unable to gain employment in an academic position. This changed in 1918 when she was hired as professor at Mills College, where she established the department of sociology and served as its first chair. Finally, she retired in 1926 as professor emeritus. Afterward, she co-authored The Rain-makers: Indians of Arizona and New Mexico (1929), The Navajo Indians (1930), and The Last of the Seris (1939) with her husband.

From 1986-1988, with significant funding from student government, and sponsor support from Peddlers Bike Shop, Cannondale, Continental Tires, Puma, Lake Shoes, Desente, Zepher Helmets, Go sports drink, Jolt cola, Chance Chiropractic and the Bicycle Club Apartments, the team's top riders competed in pro-am United States Cycling Federation (USCF) races throughout the United States, but primarily within the Southeast. Team Florida joined the Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference (SECCC) of the National Collegiate Cycling Association (NCCA) in 1989 and began racing in both USCF and NCCA races. Team Florida's first participation in an organized race was a Primo Bike Works' 10 mile time trial starting and finishing at the Hopewell Baptist Church on Wacahoota Road Southwest of Gainesville in late 1985 or early 1986. The first Team Florida win was achieved by Paul Chludzinski in a Citizen's Class criterium in Cocoa Beach in spring 1986. The team's first USCF licensed win was secured by Michael Franovich in a Category IV road race on the Sawgrass Expressway, prior to its July 3, 1986 opening. The first collegiate race win was accomplished by Geoff Rogers in a ‚ÄúB‚Äù Category Race at the University of Georgia in 1989. Although bike races had been held on campus as early as the 1950s, the first race hosted by Team Florida was held in Fall 1986. The six turn USCF sanctioned criterium ran clockwise. It featured a start/finish in front of the Florida Gym on Stadium Road, turned right onto North South Drive (now known as Gale Lemerand Drive) pass the stadium, turned right onto East West Drive (turn no longer exists due to North stadium stands construction), from East West Drive right onto Fletcher Drive, left on what was a road between Pugh and Dauer Halls, right onto Buckman Drive which becomes Stadium Road, and past the Hub before returning to the start/finish. Andy Woodruff, who would eventually ride for Team Florida in the early 1990s, won the Men's Pro, 1,2,3 race. Team sponsored circuit races around Lake Alice were held in 1987 and 1988. The first Stage Race was held in 1989 and featured a downtown twilight criterium and a road race on Dungarvin Road. Team Florida was recognized as the University of Florida's Sports Club of the Year for 2015-2016. In 2017, with student interest in racing declining, Team Florida leadership chose to have the club focus on noncompetitive recreational riding, the team lost its standing as a sports club, and stopped participating in SECCC events. As of October 2019 however, the team had regained its status as a UF Sports Club.  Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference Championships = Road = *1989 SECCC Team Time Trial Champions.

Biography Isely was born to Dwight Isely, a professor of entomology, and Blessie Elise, both of whom studied and worked at the University of Arkansas. He too graduated from the University of Arkansas with a bachelor's degree in 1938 and a master's degree in 1939. In 1942 he received his PhD from Cornell University with thesis supervisor Walter Conrad Muenscher (1891‚Äì1963). From 1942 to 1944 Isely conducted studies on the herbaceous plants of the reservoirs being constructed for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In 1944 he was appointed an extension associate at Iowa State University, where he was put in charge of the seed laboratory. At Iowa State University he was an assistant professor from 1947 to 1948, an associate professor from 1949 to 1955, and a full professor from 1956 to 1981. He was appointed Distinguished Professor in 1981 and retired in 1989 as professor emeritus. As a specialist in seed technology, Isely published a textbook and more than 50 articles on the subject. In addition, he was an active weed scientist, publishing about 20 books and laboratory manuals on native weeds and naturalized legumes (Fabaceae) from the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). He collected legumes in most of the states of the USA and his total of collected specimens exceeded 11,000. In the 1980s he played an important role in having the Iowa State University Herbarium renamed in honor of Ada Hayden. He was married three times. There were two children from his first marriage.

It was originally founded in 1982, encapsulated within the Alberta Arbitration and Mediation Society (AAMS), but the two organizations split in 2012 so that AAMS could continue to exist with charitable status, while ADRIA emerged and carried on the membership based non-profit work. ADRIA's mandate is to promote the use of ADR while offering education and training to individuals across Alberta and the Northwest Territories in negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and restorative practices. The organization has been used as a source for ADR information, resources and expertise in a range of both private and government matters. This now includes having a key role in the annual Conflict Resolution Day, hosted on the third Thursday of every October since 2007, which seeks to promote awareness for the utility of ADR practices. In 2013 ADRIA helped provide input for the review of the Condominium Property Act with regards to dispute resolution issues. ADRIA is one of the seven regional affiliates of the ADR Institute of Canada (ADRIC), which presides as the institutions' national body, founded on August 1, 2000, following the consolidation of the Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Canada (AMIC) and the Canadian Foundation for Dispute Resolution (CFDR). The regional affiliates that have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ADRIC are: * ADR Institute of Alberta (ADRIA), first signed MOU in 1996, originally as Alberta Arbitration and Mediation Society. * ADR Institute of British Columbia (ADR BC), first signed MOU in 1996, originally as British Columbia Arbitration and Mediation Institute. * ADR Institute of Ontario (ADRIO), first signed MOU in 1996, originally as Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Ontario Inc. * ADR Institute of Saskatchewan (ADR SK), first signed MOU in 1996, originally as Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Saskatchewan Inc. * ADR Atlantic Institute (ADRAI), first signed MOU in 1996, originally as Atlantic Provinces Arbitration and Mediation Institute. * ADR Institute of Manitoba (ADRIM), signed MOU in 2013. * Institut de m√©diation et d'arbitrage du Qu√©bec (IMAQ), first signed MOU in 2013. In 2019 a new federation-wide MOU was signed between ADRIC and all its regional affiliates.  ADR use in Alberta  While ADR generally receives less use in Canada than in the US, its application has been steadily increasing since the 1970s. Specifically in the Albertan context, from 1970-2000 a number of organizations related some form of ADR were founded, such as the Native Counselling Services of Alberta (NCSA) in 1970, the Alberta Arbitration and Mediation Society in 1982, Strathcona County Community Mediation Society (SCCM) in 1995, Foundation of Administrative Justice (FOAJ) in 1999, and many more. The creation of these can be observed as part of a greater trend across Canada which in the 1990s began to adopt a number of ADR programs as an alternative to litigation, particularly in regards to civil claims. = Community Mediation = Community mediation is an approach to alternative dispute resolution that is central to Alberta's ADR history. Organizations such as the Edmonton Community Mediation Society (ECM) and Calgary Community Mediation Society (CCM) were founded in the 1980s, and were some of the first adopters of ADR practices in Alberta, providing ‚Äúconflict resolution for the community by the community.\\" Community mediation practices are also present in certain faith based groups, such as the Mennonites and Ismaili communities. Indigenous peoples from a number of tribes also have traditions that strongly relate to the principles adopted in community mediation and restorative justice, and have been practicing these extensively in Alberta for generations. = Courts = Since the mid 1990s, the Judicial system in Alberta began to recognize the potential of ADR to alleviate the increasing strain on the courts caused by the public's expectation that trials and judges are the de facto approach dispute resolution. To address this, a few ADR programs were initiated with varying longevity to utilize the benefits of mediation and arbitration alongside court proceedings. In 1998 Alberta's Provincial Court began experimenting with mandatory mediation in civil claims through the Provincial Court Civil Mediation Program. Initially started as a pilot project in Edmonton and Calgary courts, the program still exists and has been expanded to several more regions across the province. This program involved the selection of particular cases that a court adjudication committee determined could be settled using mediation instead of going right to trial. In 2005, this program recorded a 63% settlement rate using interest based mediation. Reforming the Family Justice System is an initiative that started in 2014 between a number of government and non-government actors. The initiative seeks to \\"improve awareness, coordination and availability of a wide range of services that support children and families, including information resources, legal resources, related health and social services, prevention assistance and resolution services.\\" This effort was founded on the basis that family conflict, especially that which is managed through litigation, can lead to long lasting negative effects on the children exposed to it. As such, the initiative advocates for an increased awareness and use of mediation and educational resources to reform both the Family Justice System in Alberta and the culture surrounding family conflict. As of September 1, 2019, the enforcement of mandatory alternative dispute resolution rules 8.4(3)(a) and 8.5(1)(a) will come into effect under a pilot project that aims to promote ADR use in the Court of Queens bench. The rules state that parties pursuing civil and family law actions ‚Äúwill participate in at least one of the dispute resolution processes described in R. 4.16(1) to be completed prior to trial.‚Äù = Government = One of the first major inquiries into the use of ADR by the Government of Alberta came in the mid 1990s, in particular through the Interaction '96 (I'96) conference held in Edmonton in 1996. With over 700 attendees from around the world, it is the largest ADR conference ever held in Canada. At its conclusion, individuals who had attended the meeting continued to dialogue among themselves, which led to the formation of the Dispute Resolution Network (DRN). The DRN was an informal collection of ADR focused initiatives and individuals within the Government of Alberta, acting as a center for the government's interest in ADR. This conference was essential in promoting the interdepartmental spirit that would allow ADR practices to be explored as a legitimate method to settling disputes. In 1994 with the Municipal Government Act allowed local authorities the power ‚Äúto govern municipalities in whatever way the Councils consider appropriate.\\" Dispute resolution processes were added to the Act in 1995 and then again in 1999, which ensured that disputing municipalities pursued mediation before appealing to the Municipal Government Board for a binding decision. In 1998 AAMS, the foundation from which ADRIA would emerge, helped relevant stakeholders to create the Intermunicipal Dispute Resolution Initiative, which would come to provide the mediation services outlined in the 1999 Municipal Government Act amendment. Encapsulating a range of alternative dispute resolution methods, ADR has become increasingly adopted by a number of government and private entities across Alberta over the last two decades. In 2011, Alberta's Police Act was changed to require that alternative dispute resolution processes \\"be offered in all appropriate situations, early in the police complaint process.\\" Many of the mediators included in the roster for this initiative are trained practitioners with memberships to ADRIA and similar organizations. = Industry = For decades a number of companies in Alberta have relied on ADR practices to help resolve a variety of disputes. This is particularly prevalent in the organizations involved in the extraction of natural resources, in which land and trade disputes can be tied up in courts for years. In 1998‚Äì1999, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board instituted ADR focused reforms in order to \\"[facilitate] the industry-landowner relationship and avoiding or minimizing conflicts.\\" It aimed implement ADR mechanisms to help resole landowner issues, through use of \\"company-sponsored consultations and negotiations, third-party mediation, company executive involvement, and EUB senior staff/Board Member assistance.\\"\\"Alberta Ministry of Energy 1998/99 Annual Report,\\"https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/cbd7147b-d304-4e3e-af28-78970c71232c/resource/8c448855-07d7-4d48-9ded-3587fa431671/download/ar1999.pdf, Alberta Ministry of Energy. Accessed July 11, 2019. In 2001, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) also codified the use of ADR in its guiding principles. Such practices not only provide a higher chance of quick dispute settlements, but are also considered a more effective way of maintaining relationships between disputing parties: a factor that is incredibly important when considering economic partnerships or agreements.

She subsequently pursued research in music cognition, including fieldwork in ethnomusicology (in Mexico).Berent, I., El enfoque √©mico en el an√°lisis de tradiciones musicales orales: Hacia un estudio del pensamiento musical.

Heterofon√≠a, 1987. 97: p. 28-44. Her early research sought to examine how listeners parse musical structure as they listen to music on-line,Berent, I. and C.A. Perfetti, An on- line method in studying music parsing. Cognition, 1993. 46(3): p. 203-22. and how this process is shaped by both innate principles as experience with distinct musical idioms. She earned an MA degrees in Musicology and an MS degree in Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. She was the recipient of a Predoctoral Mellon Fellowship. Her dissertation research (supported by a second Mellon Fellowship) examined the universal constraints on the sound pattern of language shapes the on-line representation of printed words (under Charles Perfetti). She earned her PhD in cognitive psychology, also from the University of Pittsburgh. She pursued Post-Doctoral research with Guy Van Orden at Arizona State University (supported by NIH NRSA award).Berent, I. and G.C. Van Orden, Do null phonemic masking effects reflect strategic control of phonology? Reading and Writing, 2003. 16(4): p. 349-376.Berent, I. and G. Van Orden, Homophone dominance modulates the phonemic-masking effect. Scientific studies of reading, 2000. 42: p. 133-167.  Research and career  Berent has explored phonology as a window into the basis of the human capacity for language, and, more generally, into human nature. Every natural language‚Äîspoken or signed‚Äîis composed of abstract patterns of meaningless elements (phonology).Hockett, C.F., The origin of speech. Sci Am, 1960. 203: p. 89-96. English, for example, allows syllables such as blog, but it disallows patterns like lbog. Moreover, syllables like blog are also more frequent across languages.Greenberg, J., H., Some generalizations concerning initial and final consonant clusters, in Universals of Human Language, J.H. Greenberg, C.A. Ferguson, and E.A. Moravcsik, Editors. 1978, Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA. p. 243-279. Berent's research has examined whether phonological patterns are governed by tacit linguistic rules that are inborn in humans (universal grammar).Chomsky, N. and M. Halle, The sound pattern of English. 1968, New York: Harper & Row. xiv, 470.Chomsky, N., Language and mind. Enl. ed. 1972, New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. xii, 194 p. Most languages, however, realize phonological patterns as speech acts, so it is possible that the constraints on phonological patterns arise not from abstract linguistic rules but rather from the motor and sensory constraints on the production and perception of speech sounds.Ohala, J.J., The origin of sound patterns in vocal tract constraints, in The production of speech, P.F. MacNeilage, Editor. 1983, Springer-Verlag: New-York. p. 189 - 216.MacNeilage, P.F. and B.L. Davis, On the origin of internal structure of word forms. Science, 2000. 288: p. 527-531.Blevins, J., Evolutionary phonology. 2004, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. xix, 366 p. For example, blog might be preferred only because it is easier for the speech motor system to perceive and produce. Additionally, English speakers might prefer patterns like blog because these patterns are more familiar, not because people rely on abstract rules. Thus, knowledge of language could be due to factors are not specific to language, namely, sensorimotor constraints and experience. Berent's research has examined both possibilities. One line of research has demonstrated that knowledge of language is governed by tacit algebraic rules, that are evident in adults (both speakersBerent, I. and S. Pinker, The dislike of regular plurals in compounds: Phonological familiarity or morphological constraint? The Mental Lexicon, 2007. 2(2): p. 129‚Äì181.Berent, I., S. Pinker, and J.

Werker, Binding at birth: Newborns detect identity relations and sequential position in speech. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 2012. 24(3): p. 564-574. A complementary line of work has shown that speakers‚Äîadults and newborn infants‚Äîconverge on the same abstract phonological rules even when these principles are unattested in their linguistic experience.Tamasi, K. and I.

Smolensky, Language universals in human brains. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2008. 105(14): p. 5321-5325. The possibility that these phonological restrictions are governed by abstract rules is further supported by the discovery that these rules are spared in individuals with dyslexia‚Äîa reading disorder known to compromise low levels of speech processing (phonetics).Lepp√§nen, P.H.T., U. Richardson, E. Pihko, K.M. Eklund, T.K. Guttorm, M. Aro, and H. Lyytinen, Brain responses to changes in speech sound durations differ between infants with and without familial risk for dyslexia. Developmental Neuropsychology, 2002. 22(1): p. 407-422.Serniclaes, W., L. Sprenger-Charolles, R. Carr√©, and J.F. Demonet, Perceptual discrimination of speech sounds in developmental dyslexia. Journal Of Speech, Language, And Hearing Research: JSLHR, 2001. 44(2): p. 384-399. These results suggest that phonological knowledge is not solely due to experience with certain sound patterns. A second line of inquiry examined whether phonological restrictions reflect abstract linguistic principles or the sensorimotor constraints on speech processing, narrowly. To this end, Berent has compared phonological restrictions across two distinct language modalities‚Äîspeech and signs. In one line of inquiry, she has shown that spoken and signed languages share common principles.Berent, I., O. Bat-El, and V. Vaknin-Nusbaum, The double identity of doubling: Evidence for the phonology-morphology split. Cognition, 2017. 161: p. 117-128.Berent, I., O. Bat-El, D. Brentari, A. Dupuis, and V. Vaknin- Nusbaum, The double identity of linguistic doubling. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2016. 113(48): p. 13702-13707.Andan, Q., O. Bat- El, D. Brentari, and I. Berent, ANCHORING is amodal: Evidence from a signed language. Cognition, 2018. 180: p. 279-283. Strikingly, speakers who have had no command of a sign language can spontaneously project those principles from their native spoken language to linguistic signs.Berent, I., A. Dupuis, and D. Brentari, Amodal aspects of linguistic design. PLoS ONE, 2013. 8(4). A second line of work has demonstrated that people remain sensitive to phonological structure even when their brain motor system is temporarily altered (by mechanical stimulation Zhao, X. and I. Berent, The basis of the syllable hierarchy: articulatory pressures or universal phonological constraints? Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 2018. 47(1): p. 29-64. and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.Berent, I., A.-K. Brem, X. Zhao, E. Seligson, H. Pan, J. Epstein, A.M. Galaburda, and A. Pascual-Leone, Role of the motor system in language knowledge. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2015. 112: p. 1983-1988. These results suggest that the restrictions on phonology are not solely restrictions on speech sounds. Taken as a whole, Berent's research is consistent with the hypothesis that language is constrained by abstract rules that are inborn in humans (universal grammar). Innateness, however, is a thorny question in philosophy, psychology, and linguistics. To explore why discussions of innate knowledge elicit such strong reactions, Berent has recently begun examining how laypeople reason about human nature. The results suggest that people are systematically and selectively biased against the possibility that knowledge is innate. Berent traces these biases to the collision between two principles of core cognition‚ÄîDualism and essentialism. Her forthcoming book (The blind storyteller: How we reason about human nature; Oxford University Press, 2020) explores how core cognition meddles with our understanding of a host of topics, including why we go insane about our brain, why believe that psychiatric disorders like major depression are in our destiny (whereas dyslexia is ‚Äújust in our heads‚Äù), and what we think happens when we die.

They named themselves after a non-existent place which would have suggested chaos, wretchedness or some similar context to their contemporaries. They dressed as monks and elected a madman as their abbot, who ruled the men from a theatrical stage. The Brothelynghamites caused much trouble in the city and its environs, regularly emerging from their base‚Äîwhich may have been some form of medieval theatre‚Äîand terrorising the populace of Exeter. Bearing their 'Abbot' aloft before them, they kidnapped locals whom they held for ransom and extortion, although it is likely that they saw themselves as theatrical players rather than criminals. The Bishop of Exeter, John Grandisson, issued instructions to his agents in Chudleigh to investigate, condemn and excommunicate the order, explicitly for their disobedience and debauchery. As one of the few such gangs known to modern historians, the order of Brothelyngham is considered historiographically significant for what it implicitly suggests of anticlerical activities and attitudes in England during this period. The name was probably a play on the Order of Sempringham, which was the target of contemporary gossip and rumour on account of enclosing both monks and nuns on the same premises. Background The order of Brothelyngham was a pseudo-religious order created in Exeter in 1348 for the purpose of satirising the clergy, with no less antipathy for the fact that it was said to have been non-violent. Such \\"fool societies\\" were rare in England, argues the scholar E. K. Chambers, and the Order of Brothelyngham is one of the few known to historians. Historian G. G. Coulton has noted that \\"medieval buffoons often parodied ecclesiastical titles\\", for example, the Boy Bishop, and ecclesiastical parodies were favoured for their societies (such as the Abbey of Cokaygne). They were an early expression of what became known later as Soci√©t√©s Joyeuses, also known as an \\"Abbey of Misrule\\"‚Äîparticularly, comments the medievalist Katja Gvozdeva, with its emphasis on \\"carnivalesque rituals\\". Riotousness in Exeter Exeter around 200 years later The Brothelynham gang was composed, as were English monasteries during the period, solely of men. On repeated, regular occasions, the gang disturbed the peace of the city with assaults and riots. On 11 June that year John Grandisson, the Bishop of Exeter, writing from Chudleigh, instructed his chief agents in Exeter‚Äîthe dean, the archdeacon, and the rector of Exeter Cathedral‚Äîto investigate the order and its members, whom he referred to as \\"malign men\\". They were instructed to condemn the order the following Sunday by means of proclamations in Exeter Cathedral and all the other churches and chapels of the city. They were to emphasise that those who disobeyed would not only be excommunicated but met with physical force, as the bishop could‚Äîand would‚Äîcall upon the assistance of the city militia. Grandisson believed that their \\"order, or rather error\\", as he phrased it, were comparable to \\"thorns and thistles\\" growing in the field of religion, which needed to be cut away so as to prevent the Church being \\"marred or disordered\\". The leader of the Order‚Äîwhom the members idolised‚Äîwas a known \\"lunatic and raver\\"; he was appointed the Order's abbot. He enthroned and carried around on a mock-episcopal chair: his followers, in a similar vein, wore monks' habits and used horns to fanfare their abbot, who ruled them as from a theatrical stage, an imitation of the bishop's dias. However, the bishop's use of the word theatre‚Äîtheatrum‚Äîneeds analysis, says the historian R. P. Chope, as Exeter possessed no such building in this period. The Brothelyngham monks paraded their abbot around the streets of Exeter on something akin to a litter, and, with their abbot enthroned above them, they proceeded to beat up and rob such citizens as they encountered. The medievalist Derek Brewer has argued that, to modern historians and commentators, \\"such sport is as much folklore as drama\\", but the members of the order seem to have considered themselves actors rather than villains. To the Church, though, they were a criminal gang who‚Äîexpanding their operations from the city‚Äîinvaded local towns and villages, where, says Chambers, they \\"beset in a great company the streets and places\\", many of them on horse. They then extorted money from the inhabitants when they met them. They also kidnapped many people, both the religious and laity, from whom they would demand ransoms. Grandisson noted that, although the gang called this ludus,‚Äî\\"under colour and veil of a game, or rather a farce\\", he says‚Äîsimply, \\"it was sheer rapine\\". They may well have been debauched in their behaviour, suggests Gvozdeva, and a contemporary record describes them as \\"a pestilent sect, guilty of great excesses\\" in the city. They were certainly disobedient, and either of which would be sufficient to ensure the bishop's ire. They appear not to have heeded the bishop's edicts, for he subsequently excommunicated the order, calling the men \\"a threat to religion, the King and the Church\\": \\"not least\\", comments Luxford, \\"to the monks of Cowick and St Nicholas's and the nuns of Polsloe\\". =Name= Although the order claimed to be \\"of Brothelyngham\\", this was a fiction‚Äîthere was no such place. However, the name was not without implication and would have had meaning to contemporaries. They would have understood the word to have meant brethelyng, brethel or brothel, meaning 'good for nothing', 'chaotic' 'wretched' or 'foul', rather than a bawdy house. The Victorian antiquary Francis Charles Hingeston-Randolph, who edited Gradisson's Registrum, suggested that it is possible that the title was bestowed upon the gang by the bishop himself, in his indignation that people so worthless would \\"guilty laugh Holy Religion\\", as he put it. Hingeston-Randolph also understood the Brothelynghamites to be more in the manner of a dissenting sect of the Church than a criminal gang. He commented, \\"I must confess that I cannot understand this. There was no such Order, and I believe that there was no such place\\". The name Brothelyngham was probably a satirical nod towards Sempringham Priory, which in the Middle Ages was also known humorously as Simplingham. The scholar Ian Mortimer suggests that the Premonstratensian monastery of Sempringham was an obvious target for popular satire, as it was the only abbey in the country which housed both monks and nuns under the same roof: \\"sniggering in some secular quarters [was] inevitable\\". Later events In 1351, in a similar outbreak of anti-clerical fake monasticism in the area, another group of pseudo-monks‚Äîdescribing themselves as an \\"order of hermits\\"‚Äîoccurred in Townstal. The men \\"claimed power by a special papal privilege to hear confession and offer the sacraments\\" without Grandisson's permission, or, indeed, any theological training whatsoever. Exeter and its theatre would seem to have been a focus for sociopathic behaviour, and in 1353 Grandisson issued an order to close down a performance called Ludum Noxium, a satire against the city's cloth- dressing (textile finishing) industry, which was causing disturbance. Performed by their rivals the leather sellers, Grandisson condemned their play as being composed \\"in contumely and approbrium\\" (i.e., in insulting language and showing scornful contempt). Historiography The historiographical significance for historians, says Gvozdeva, is not that the gang wanted to be proper monks, have an abbot or be part of a mendicant order, but that they took upon themselves the appearance and, in their eyes, the attitudes of one. The medievalist Julian Luxford has described it illustrating the extent of ill-feeling felt by the general population towards the perceived \\"abbatial greed and luxurious living\\" they suspected the religeuse of commonly indulging in against their Rule. Luxford has argued that for the modern historian, the significance of the order is what their own expressed beliefs reveal of their own‚Äîand likely more general‚Äîviews of the priesthood: that, for example, \\"monks and nuns blindly followed leaders, were idolatrous, avaricious, even luxurious (thus 'Brothelyngham‚Äô)\\". \\"The insinuation of this satire about grasping abbots\\", says the historian Martin Heale, \\"is hard to mistake\\". In her study of French late-medieval theatre, Gvozdeva has suggested that the order of Brothelyngham \\"demonstrates particularly well the ambiguous relationship between the play, ritual and theatre\\", noting the theatrical nature of the order's activities: the members celebrate the investiture of their abbot with horns, it takes place takes place on trestles (in theatro) and his character is clearly intended to be a burlesque.

Its organ from 1984 makes it also a concert venue, where international organists such as Olivier Latry have performed.  History  View from other bank of the Rhine The present Gothic building was begun in the 13th century, replacing an earlier Romanesque basilica. The choir was built first, around 1270, possibly by craftspeople who also worked at the Cologne Cathedral. After an interruption, the main nave was built from around 1304. A second nave was begun in 1398. The steeple was erected on the foundation of a watch tower from Roman times. The front to the West was remodelled by an entrance hall around 1480. A fire destroyed the roof of the church and the steeple in 1554, repairs were done by 1576 and 1578 respectively. The parish was part of the Diocese of Mainz until the Diocese of Limburg was founded. In 2002, it became part of the Rhine Gorge UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Features  High altar The church's high altar is from 1483. The monochrome carved wooden altar was attributed to the workshop of Master Hans (Bilger) from Worms, but this is not confirmed, and comparison to other works by him raises doubts. The altar is the highest and first monochrome carved altar in Germany. The church features choir benches from the end of the 13th century with carvings of figures, a Gothic tabernacle from the 15th century. Many of the church's valuable religious art works were sold in the 19th century by parson Geiger to finance a renovation; remaining pieces include a Piet√† from ca. 1400 and a baptismal font from 1464. Two altars in the aisles are from the shop of Hans Steinlein. = Organ = The organ The present organ was completed in 1984, built by . The organ has 43 stops, three manuals and pedal.

Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

The species is known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington State, United States. The species was first described from fossil leaves found in the Klondike Mountain Formation. Rhus boothillensis likely hybridized with the other Klondike Mountain formation sumac species Rhus garwellii, Rhus malloryi, and Rhus republicensis. Distribution and paleoenvironment Rhus boothillensis is known from specimens which are recovered from an outcrop of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic. The Klondike Mountain Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer‚Äìbroadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm. Taxonomy The species was described from a type specimen, the holotype leaf, number SR 09-30-07, and a group of five paratype specimens. The type series specimens are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the Stonerose Interpretive Center in Republic, Washington. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Soon Flynn and Kathleen Pigg of Arizona State University with Melanie DeVore of Georgia College and State University. They published their 2019 type description for R. boothillensis in the International Journal of Plant Sciences. The etymology of the chosen specific name boothillensis is a reference to the \\"Boot Hill\\" dig site at which 30 years of public diggers have collected fossils. In addition to Rhus boothillensis Flynn et al also provided descriptions of the coeval species Rhus garwellii and Rhus republicensis and a gave a redescription of Rhus malloryi in the 2019 paper. They noted that the Klondike Mountain Formation preserves a number of Rhus specimens which appear to be hybrids of the named species. Description R. boothillensis leaves are pinnately compound on an at least long petiole, with the full length of the rachis unknown. The subopposite leaflets attach to the rachis between wide wings that bracket the stems midvein. The leaflets have a petiolule unlike R. malloryi and R. republicensis which both have sessile leaflets. The leaflets are elliptical in outline, tapering from the wide middle to the asymmetrical base and pointed apex. They have a width of and a length to width ratio of up to 4.2:1. The midveins of the leaflets are thicker at the base and narrow from base to the leaflet apex, with smaller secondary veins branching off the midvein at acute angles. The secondaries are branch from the midvein alternately and change to being subopposite near the leaflet tip, and run straight to slightly curved towards the leaflet edges. The secondary veins branch once near the leaflet margin and may either enter a tooth or sinus, or branch again before entering a tooth or sinus. On occasion a vein branch may form a loop upwards and joint to the next secondary vein apically. The teeth are rounded on their tips with convex basal and apical sides running towards variable sinuses. The leafy wings of the rachis do not show any obvious vein structure, unlike R. republicensis.

He was previously served in the Chamber of Deputies from 1999 to 2019 and was mayor of S√£o Borja from 1993 1996. Personal life Heinze was born to Darcy Volnier Heinze and Cecy Therezinha Seckler. Of German descent, he is married to Sandra Maria Batista Heinze. He is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil. Political career Heinze voted in favor of the impeachment motion of then- president Dilma Rousseff. Heinze voted for a similar corruption investigation into Rousseff's successor Michel Temer. He voted in favor of the 2017 Brazilian labor reforms. Along with Paulo Paim, Heinze was elected to the federal senate from the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the 2018 Brazilian general election. Heinze is known in Brazil for his strong advocacy of the right to bear arms, which has been a central theme in his election campaigns. Controversy In a public hearing held in the municipality of Vicente Dutra in November 2013, Heinze said that \\"quilombolas, Indians, gays, lesbians\\" are \\"everything that is not good.\\" In February 2014 these comments were published in the national newspapers, although Heinze stood by his words and said that he meant what he said. He also said that he supported forming a private militia. On 7 December 2013 Heinze was the speaker at an event in Campo Grande about passing legislation making it legal to organize militia to protect settlements from native peoples. In his speech Heinze criticized Gilberto Carvalho, saying that his office was a \\"nest of Indians, blacks, landless people, gays, and lesbians\\". Heinze later claimed his comments were made in the heat of the moment. As a result of these comments the international indigenous rights NGO Survival International dubbed Heinze the \\"racist of the year.\\" References Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rio Grande do Sul Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian Lutherans Category:Brazilian engineers Category:Progressistas politicians Category:Members of the Federal Senate Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil) from Rio Grande do Sul Category:Mayors of places in Brazil Category:Gun rights advocates ","title":"Luis Carlos Heinze"},{"id":"61239355","text":"with text of James 1:10-12 Textual variants in the Epistle of James are the subject of the study called textual criticism of the New Testament.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

Research  Krampe's research interests include peace and conflict research, environmental and climate security, as well as international security. In his current research he studies how climate change impacts the effectiveness of peacebuilding, showing that \\"Eight of the ten countries hosting the most multilateral peace operations personnel in 2018 are located in areas highly exposed to climate change.\\" Krampe led one of the first studies explicitly looking at the impact of climate change on the success of United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM). The study shows that \\"The impacts of climate change have hindered UNSOM in its work to provide peace and security in Somalia and in its efforts to establish functioning governance and judicial systems.\\" In February 2020 the findings of the study informed the UN Security Council discussions on Somalia. Krampe is furthermore known for his research on post-conflict management of natural resources and environmental peacebuilding, focusing among others on peacebuilding potential of micro-hydropower development Nepal, as well as water supply management in Kosovo and East Timor. Theoretically, Krampe contributed to environmental peacebuilding by suggesting two dominant research perspectives: the cooperation perspective, driven by the potential of environmental cooperation to contribute to peace through spillover effects. This perspective focuses primarily on the interstate level and often on conflict prevention rather than post-conflict peacebuilding. In contrast, the resource risk perspective recognises resource-induced instability, especially after intrastate conflicts, and stresses the need to mitigate these risks to sustain the absence of violence (negative peace), through facilitating environmental cooperation.[7]  Career  Krampe received his PhD from Uppsala University in 2016. Since 2017 he is working in the climate change and risk programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).https://www.sipri.org/about/bios/dr-florian-krampe He has been Visiting Research Fellow at the Pufendorf Institute of Advanced Studies, Lund University and a student fellow at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO). Since 2016, Krampe is an Affiliated Researcher at the Research School for International Water Cooperation at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University. Krampe has published in Global Environmental Politics and The Lancet Global Health as well as Cooperation and Conflict. Krampe's expertise on climate security and environmental peacebuilding has informed intergovernmental organizations and policy actors. He has engaged among others with UN Environment, the African Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), as well as the German Federal Foreign Office and the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Krampe's research has received coverage by major global news outlets, including Deutsche Welle, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Hindustan Times, and CNBC Africa.

A co-production between HBO and Keshet Studios, this limited series is based on true events and focuses on re- telling the story of the kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir. The ten-episode series premiered on August 12, 2019, on HBO. Cast *Shlomi Elkabetz as Simon * Jony Arbid as Hussein Abu Khdeir * Adam Gabay as Avishay Elbaz * Or Ben-Melech as Yosef Haim Ben-David * Ruba Blal Asfour as Suha Abu Khdeir * Eyal Shikartzi as Yinon Edri * Lior Ashkenazi as State Attorney deputy Uri Korb * Jacob Cohen as Rabbi Shalom Ben-David * Ram Masarweh as Mohammed Abu Khdeir https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/08/hbo-our-boys- israeli-palestinian-writers * Shadi Mar'i as Eyad Abu Khdeir  Premise  The series begins with the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers at the hands of Palestinian militant group Hamas. This then prompts a retaliation, which involves the kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir (Masarweh). Three Jews carry out the attack, an adult and his two young relatives. Aside from the grief of the victims' families, the series also follows the investigation of Khdeir's murder and the tension that emerges among Jewish and the Arab community after the incident. Episodes Production In October 2016, it was reported that HBO was creating a series on the 2014 kidnapping of 3 Israeli teens with Keshet International. The series was filmed on location in Israel and directed by Israeli filmmaker Joseph Cedar and Palestinian writer and director Tawfik Abu Wael, who also co-created the series alongside showrunner Hagai Levi. Reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating with an average score of 7/10, based on 12 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Challenging and thoughtful, Our Boys explores a real-world tragedy with grace and compassion.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 79 out of 100 based on eight critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". 120 bereaved Israeli families sent a letter to HBO protesting the series, claiming that the show largely glosses over the murder of the three Israeli teens, and that there is a systemic difference in the societal treatment and acceptance of terrorism between Israelis and Palestinians. They demanded that HBO clarify that Palestinian terrorism is much more prevalent than Jewish terrorism. HBO declined to comply with the request. Awards and nominations The series won 14 Israeli Academy Awardshttps://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/our-boys- wins-big-at-israeli-academy-of-film-and-television-awards-626333 including Best Drama Series Award, Best Actor for Johnny Arbid, Best Actress for Ruba Blal Asfour, Best Photography for Yaron Scharf, plus Best Direction and Best Screenplay for Hagai Levi, Joseph Cedar and Tawfik Abu Wael. Our Boys has also received nominations in the Entertainment category of the 2020 Peabody Awardshttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/peabody-awards- nominations-2020-list-full-1289403 and in the Foreign language category of the 2020 Multi-Ethnicity in Communications (NAMIC) Vision Awards. Controversies The critical issue that the series depicts sparked an emotional stir in the Palestinian Territories, and received extensive backlash from Israel. The story of a teenager, Muhammad Abu Khdeir, who was killed in 2014 brought back painful memories of the Palestinians and his family. Abu Khdeir's mother, Suha, said that the series brought her back to the day her son was kidnapped. \\"I wish I could reach into the screen and grab hold of my son,\\" she said. On the other hand, critics argued that the series is skewing reality and denting Israel's image. Yair Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu's son, wrote on Twitter, \\"The series tells the whole world how the Israelis and Jews are cruel and bloodthirsty murderers, and how the Palestinians are badly done by and oppressed.\\" Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the series \\"antisemitic\\" and called to boycott its co-producing Israeli channel 12. His criticism of the series was accompanied by other remarks towards the network after Netanyahu tried to stop its news department from airing leaked quotes from a legal investigation of his own suspected corruption, earlier the same day.

RE/flex offers full Unicode support, indentation anchors, word boundaries, lazy quantifiers (non-greedy, lazy repeats), and performance tuning options. RE/flex accepts Flex lexer specifications and offers options to generate scanners for Bison parsers. RE/flex includes a fast C++ regular expression library.  History  The RE/flex project was designed and implemented by professor Robert van Engelen in 2016 and released in 2017 as free open source. The software evolved with several contributions made by others. The RE/flex tool generates lexical analyzers based on regular expression (\\"regex\\") libraries, instead of fixed DFA tables generated by traditional lexical analyzer generators.  Lexer specification  The RE/flex lexical analyzer generator accepts a lexer specification as input. The RE/flex specification syntax is more expressive than traditional Flex lexer specification syntax, and may include indentation anchors, word boundaries, lazy quantifiers (non-greedy, lazy repeats), and new actions such as \`wstr()\` to retrieve Unicode wide-string matches. A lexer specification is of the form: Definitions %% Rules %% User Code The Definitions section includes declarations and customization options, followed by name-pattern pairs to define names for regular expression patterns. Named patterns may be referenced in other patterns by embracing them in \`{\` and \`}\`. The following example defines two names for two patterns, where the second pattern \`number\` uses the previously named pattern \`digit\`: %top{ #include // strtol() } %class{ public: int value; // yyFlexLexer class public member } %init{ value = 0; // yyFlexLexer initializations } %option flex digit [0-9] number {digit}+ The Rules section defines pattern-action pairs. The following example defines a rule to translate a number to the lexer class integer \`value\` member: {number} value = strtol(yytext, NULL, 10); \\\\s // skip white space . throw *yytext; The User Code section typically defines C/C++ functions, for example a \`main\` program: int main() { yyFlexLexer lexer; try { while (lexer.yylex() != 0) std::cout << \\"number=\\" << lexer.value << std::endl; } catch (int ch) { std::cerr << \\"Error: unknown character code \\" << ch << std::endl; } } The \`yyFlexLexer\` class is generated by RE/flex as instructed by the \`%option flex\` directive in the lexer specification. The generated \`lex.yy.cpp\` source code contains the algorithm for lexical analysis, which is linked with the \`libreflex\` library.  Source code output  The generated algorithm for lexical analysis is based on the concept that any regular expression engine can in principle be used to tokenize input into tokens: given a set of regular expression patterns p_i for i = 1,\\\\ldots,n, a regular expression of the form \`\\"(p_1)(p_2)...(p_n)\\"\` with alternations may be specified to match and tokenize the input. In this way, the group capture index of a matching pattern p_i that is returned by the regular expression matcher identifies the pattern p_i that matched the input text partially and continuously after the previous match. This approach makes it possible for any regex library that supports group captures to be utilized as a matcher. However, note that all groupings of the form \`(X)\` in patterns must be converted to non-capturing groups of the form \`(?:X)\` to avoid any unwanted group capturing within sub-expressions. The following RE/flex-generated \`yyFlexLexer\` class \`yylex\` method repeatedly invokes the matcher's \`scan\` (continuous partial matching) operation to tokenize input: int yyFlexLexer::yylex() { if (!has_matcher()) matcher(\\"(p1)(p2)...(pn)\\"); // new matcher engine for regex pattern (p1)(p2)...(pn) while (true) { switch (matcher().scan()) // scan and match next token, get capture index { case 0: // no match if (... EOF reached ...) return 0; output(matcher().input()); // echo the current input character break; case 1: // pattern p1 matched ... // Action for pattern p1 break; case 2: // pattern p2 matched ... // Action for pattern p2 break; ... // and so on for patterns up to pn } } } If none of the patterns match and the end-of-file (EOF) is not reached, the so-called \\"default rule\\" is invoked. The default rule echo's the current input character and advances the scanner to the next character in the input. The regular expression pattern \`\\"(p_1)(p_2)...(p_n)\\"\` is produced by RE/flex from a lexer specification with rules of pattern-action pairs: %% p1 Action for pattern p1 p2 Action for pattern p2 ... pn Action for pattern pn %% From this specification, RE/flex generates the aforementioned \`yyFlexLexer\` class with the \`yylex()\` method that executes actions corresponding to the patterns matched in the input. The generated \`yyFlexLexer\` class is used in a C++ application, such as a parser, to tokenize the input into the integer-valued tokens returned by the actions in the lexer specification. For example: std::ifstream ifs(filename, std::ios::in); yyFlexLexer lexer(ifs); int token; while ((token = lexer.yylex()) != 0) std::cout << \\"token = \\" << token << std::endl; ifs.close(); Note that \`yylex()\` returns an integer value when an action executes \`return token_value;\`. Otherwise, \`yylex()\` does not return a value and continues scanning the input, which is often used by rules that ignore input such as comments. This example tokenizes a file. A lexical analyzer often serves as a tokenizer for a parser generated by a parser generator such as Bison.  Compatibility  RE/flex is compatible with Flex specifications when \`%option flex\` is used. This generates a \`yyFlexLexer\` class with \`yylex()\` method. RE/flex is also compatible with Bison using a range of RE/flex options for complete coverage of Bison options and features. By contrast to Flex, RE/flex scanners are thread-safe by default on work with reentrant Bison parsers.  Unicode support  RE/flex supports Unicode regular expression patterns in lexer specifications and automatically tokenizes UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 input files. Code pages may be specified to tokenize input files encoded in ISO/IEC 8859 1 to 16, Windows-1250 to Windows-1258, CP-437, CP-850, CP-858, MacRoman, KOI-8, EBCDIC, and so on. Normalization to UTF-8 is automatically performed by internal incremental buffering for (partial) pattern matching with Unicode regular expression patterns.  Indent, nodent, and dedent matching  RE/flex integrates indent and dedent matching directly in the regular expression syntax with new \`\\\\i\` and \`\\\\j\` anchors. These indentation anchors detect changes of line indentation in the input. This allows many practical scenarios to be covered to tokenize programming languages with indented block structures. For example, the following lexer specification detects and reports indentation changes: %% ^[ \\\\t]+ std::cout << \\" \\"; // nodent: text is aligned to current indent margin ^[ \\\\t]*\\\\i std::cout << \\"> \\"; // indent: matched with \\\\i ^[ \\\\t]*\\\\j std::cout << \\"< \\"; // dedent: matched with \\\\j \\\\j std::cout << \\"< \\"; // dedent: for each extra level dedented %%  Lazy quantifiers  Lazy quantifiers may be associated with repeats in RE/flex regular expression patterns to simplify the expressions using non-greedy repeats, when applicable. Normally matching is \\"greedy\\", meaning that the longest pattern is matched. For example, the pattern \`a.*b\` with the greedy \`*\` repeat matches \`aab\`, but also matches \`abab\` because \`.*\` matches any characters except newline and \`abab\` is longer than \`ab\`. Using a lazy quantifier \`?\` for the lazy repeat \`*?\`, pattern \`a.*?b\` matches \`ab\` but not \`abab\`. As a practical application of lazy quantifiers, consider matching C/C++ multiline comments of the form \`/*...*/\`. The lexer specification pattern \\"/*\\"(. )*?\\"*/\\" with lazy repeat \`*?\` matches multiline comments. Without lazy repeats the pattern \\"/*\\"([^*](\\\\\\\\*+[^*/]))*\\\\\\\\*+\\"/\\" should be used (note that quotation of the form \`\\"...\\"\` is allowed in lexer specifications only, this construct is comparable to the \`\\\\Q...\\\\E\` quotations supported by most regex libraries.)  Performance  RE/flex offers a choice of regular expression pattern matchers: RE/flex regex and Boost.Regex. The RE/flex regex engine is based on a DFA and usually has a time complexity of O(n) in the length of the input. Boost.Regex offers a richer regular expression pattern syntax, but is slower due to its NFA-based matching algorithm. By default RE/flex generates DFA tables to speed up the matcher's \`scan\` operation. A faster DFA for pattern matching is generated with the \`--fast\` option. This DFA is expressed in direct code instead of in tables. For example, the following coded DFA for pattern \`\\\\w+\` runs very efficiently to match words: void reflex_code_FSM(reflex::Matcher& m) { int c1; m.FSM_INIT(c1); S0: c1 = m.FSM_CHAR(); if (97 <= c1 && c1 <= 122) goto S5; if (c1  95) goto S5; if (65 <= c1 && c1 <= 90) goto S5; if (48 <= c1 && c1 <= 57) goto S5; return m.FSM_HALT(c1); S5: m.FSM_TAKE(1); c1 = m.FSM_CHAR(); if (97 <= c1 && c1 <= 122) goto S5; if (c1  95) goto S5; if (65 <= c1 && c1 <= 90) goto S5; if (48 <= c1 && c1 <= 57) goto S5; return m.FSM_HALT(c1); } Performance can be analyzed for optimization using the RE/flex built-in profiler. The profiler instruments the generated source code. When the scanner terminates, the profiler reports the number of times a rule is matched and the cumulative time consumed by the matching rule. Profiling includes the time spent in the parser when the rule returns control to the parser. This allows fine-tuning the performance of the generated scanners and parsers. First, the lexer rules that are hot spots, i.e. a computationally expensive, are detected. Then, effective optimization should focus on optimizing these expensive rules and the parser.

It consists of a one-mile paved multi use trail for walking and casual biking. Future plans call for creation of a boat launch for paddled vessels such as canoes and kayaks. The trail is connected with the regional Circuit Trails initiative, a network of trails across multiple parks in the Greater Philadelphia region that connect southern New Jersey to Pennsylvania. The park is a member of Alliance for Watershed Education of the Delaware River which actively promotes the understanding and value of the Delaware River watershed. This is an urban park that is part of the revitalization of the Camden waterfront. The tract was previously filled with derelict buildings and seedy establishments. Gateway Park is one of a number of parks in the Camden area that are contributing to the revitalization of the Camden waterfront which also includes the recently opened Cramer Hill Preserve, Petty's Island nature preserve and Coopers Poynt Waterfront park among others. Gateway Park is owned by Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority (CCMUA) and is managed by New Jersey Conservation Foundation.  History  The area for Gateway Park was previously populated with gas stations, seedy bars, motels and illicit activity. In March 1999, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman announced the Gateway Project to clean up the blighted area and present a more appealing gateway to Camden and New Jersey. This was in preparation for the 2000 republican national convention in Philadelphia and the anticipated flux of visitors who would be traveling past this location to their hotels in the suburbs. The Delaware River Port Authority bought the land and removed the unsightly properties and planted grass and laid down an asphalt walking path. Although the park was established in 2000, the land remained vacant and closed due to environmental issues for about 11 years before pressure from local advocacy groups resulted in the Delaware River Port Authority cleaning up the area to ready it for the promised public park. Ownership of the land transferred from Delaware River Port Authority to Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority (CCMUA) who in turn partnered with New Jersey Conservation Foundation to manage the park. Gateway Park opened to the public in March 2019.

While attending the USMA, Dickson played for the football team and earned his lifelong nickname of \\"Monk\\" as he disliked mandatory chapel. Dickson graduated from West Point in 1918 and was assigned to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. He was then sent to Russia as part of the American Expeditionary Force, Siberia to rescue stranded Czech soldiers. In 1920, Dickson gave up his first lieutenant's commission to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering. Military career He returned to active duty in October 1940, working in intelligence. Dickson primarily worked under Omar Bradley, commander of the First United States Army, as Bradley's chief of intelligence in North Africa. When Vichy collaborator Fran√ßois Darlan was captured in Algiers in November 1942, Dickson ordered him arrested. While serving in North Africa, Dickson was wounded in the ankle during a reconnaissance mission. Due to his many warnings about Erwin Rommel's encroaching tanks, he soon developed a reputation among his superiors for being an \\"alarmist\\" and a \\"raconteur\\". However, as chief of intelligence, Dickson was one of the few officers who had direct access to Ultra intelligence reports from Bletchley Park. When Bradley was promoted to commander of Twelfth Army Group in August 1944, Dickson became the chief intelligence officer of his replacement, Courtney Hodges. His reputation was damaged in September 1944 when he incorrectly reported that the SS was dissolving. In November 1944, both Dickson and British Army officer Kenneth Strong predicted an imminent German attack. On December 10, 1944, Dickson submitted \\"G-2 Intelligence Estimate No. 37\\", a report which warned that the German military was likely preparing to launch a counteroffensive towards the west. Dickson's report was largely ignored by his superiors due to their desire to not mar the approaching Christmas season. On December 14, Dickson reiterated his warning, stating that he believed the Germans would launch their attack in the Ardennes. He also requested that the Allies bomb nearby rail lines used by the Germans, but the Air Force Combat Command's Carl Spaatz denied his request. Prior to the counteroffensive, on-the-ground intelligence from Office of Strategic Services operatives behind the German lines was largely unavailable; Dickson had previously reassigned the First Army's OSS contingent. After delivering his reports, Dickson went on leave in Paris to celebrate his birthday. While he was in Paris, the Germans launched their attack on December 16 and the Battle of the Bulge commenced. Dickson quickly returned to the front where he continued gathering intelligence to assist the Allied troops. After the counteroffensive was successfully repelled, Dickson moved east with the First Army as they invaded Germany. Dickson left the Army on November 19, 1945. Personal life Dickson was married twice. He had one daughter with his first wife. His second wife was actress and singer Eleanor Shaler (married 1937). The couple had two children, William and Colin. In popular culture Henry Fonda portrayed a fictionalized version of Dickson in the 1965 film Battle of the Bulge.

He was the chief disciple and Dharma heir of famed Japanese Rinzai master Hakuin Ekaku (1685-1786) and was a major figure in the revival of the Rinzai school in eighteenth century Japan.T≈çrei, Taibi Shaku (1996), The Discourse on the Inexhaustible Lamp of the Zen School, C.E.

Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture. He is also known as the author of an influential text on Zen practice called \\"The Undying Lamp of Zen\\" (Sh≈´mon mujint≈ç ron), which is his magnum opus and presents the comprehensive system of Rinzai Zen as it existed at the time of Hakuin.Cleary, Thomas (2012), The Zen Reader, Shambhala Publications, p. 150.Cleary, Thomas (2010). The Undying Lamp of Zen: The Testament of Zen Master Torei, Shambhala Publications, p. viii.  Overview  Calligraphy of \\"Mu\\" by T≈çrei T≈çrei born in Kazaki, Shiga prefecture. When he was 5 years old, he met the respected Zen master Kogetsu Zenzai (1667-1751). This inspired him to begin his studies at a local monastery at the age of 9.McDaniel, Richard Bryan (2013). Zen Masters of Japan. The Second Step East . Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle Publishing, p. 300. When he was 17 he went to Daik≈ç-ji in Kyushu, where he was ordained as a Buddhist monk by Kogetsu Zenzai. Under the direction of Kogetsu, T≈çrei achieved his first kensh≈ç experience. After this experience, he set out on a pilgrimage to various Japanese monasteries. In 1743, Kogetsu suggested that he should visit Sh≈çin-ji, where T≈çrei was to meet the great Rinzai master Hakuin Ekaku and study Zen with him. T≈çrei stayed with Hakuin until he received a message from home about his mother's illness. He looked after her for two years until her death. After his mother's death, he went to a small hermitage in Kyoto, where he undertook a very rigorous and ascetic training, which ended with a deep experience of realization. However, as a result of practicing in cold conditions he developed of tuberculosis. Unsure if he would survive, he decided to write the text Sh≈´mon mujint≈ç ron (The inexhaustible lamp of Zen). He was thirty years old at the time. After he was finished, his health had improved. He sent the text to Hakuin who wrote back saying that it was an excellent introduction to Zen practice.McDaniel, Richard Bryan (2013). Zen Masters of Japan. The Second Step East . Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle Publishing, p. 302. The work presents the Zen path according to the Rinzai tradition of Hakuin and attempts to promote the unity of all Buddhist schools under the Ekayana (One Vehicle) view of Zen. He work also attempts to reconcile Zen Buddhism with Confucianism, Shintoism and Taoism. After his health improved, T≈çrei began a teaching career that would last for 40 years. He received Hakuin's robe and thus became his principle Dharma heir. He also worked alongside Hakuin to develop a koan study curriculum which remains in use today.McDaniel, Richard Bryan (2013). Zen Masters of Japan. The Second Step East . Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle Publishing, p. 306. After Hakuin‚Äôs death, T≈çrei retired to Ryutaku-ji and he remained there for twenty years overseeing its restoration. Towards the end of his life T≈çrei returned to a small temple in his hometown, where he died in 1792.McDaniel, Richard Bryan (2013). Zen Masters of Japan. The Second Step East .

He worked for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and then for NASA, and from 1975 to 1986 was the head of Equal Employment Opportunity at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He is credited with setting up training programs that allowed hundreds of African Americans to get the training necessary for positions and promotions at NASA in Huntsville, when Alabama was segregated and African Americans were denied those opportunities. To that purpose he also helped found a Computer Science program at his alma mater, Alabama A&M; University, a historically black university, where he headed the Computer Science program while on loan from NASA. In 1981 he was awarded the Philip A. Hart Award for his \\"significant contribution toward improving urban and working environments\\". Foster was also a community activist, and helped revive Triana, Alabama, a small majority-African American community near Huntsville; he was instrumental in the community regaining its charter, was a plaintiff in lawsuits filed over DDT pollution in Triana, and for two decades served as its mayor. Biography Clyde Foster was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 21, 1931, as the sixth child of twelve. He attended A. H. Parker High School, and the experience of living as an African American in segregated Birmingham made him realize he needed to get away; for that reason he attended Alabama A&M; University (a historically black university in the north of the state), where he received his BS degree in Mathematics and Chemistry in 1954. After serving two years in the United States Army, he moved to Selma, Alabama, and worked as a science teacher in Dallas County, Alabama, from 1956 to 1957. Foster left Selma and became a mathematician technician at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as part of a team that did calculations for rockets. ABMA became part of NASA in 1958, and in 1960, he and a group of colleagues were transferred to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, which had just been founded. He was assigned a position as a mathematician and instructor in the Computation Laboratory. Around that time Foster was considering leaving, but President John F. Kennedy's announcement that the new administration would charge NASA to go to the Moon made him stay. Foster worked regularly as a recruiter, trying to attract black workers to Marshall. The problem, both for hiring new workers and promoting current workers at NASA, was that training was required, and while NASA itself, as a federal entity, did not segregate, its location in a segregated state meant that employees and future employees who were African-American could not attend the kinds of training programs they needed in order to be hired or promoted, since those were held in public facilities, which were segregated (such as ballrooms of hotels that allowed whites only). Soon after he joined NASA he was asked to train a white colleague to become his boss, at a time when the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama was demanding change. Foster complained to his boss and refused the assignment, and then demanded that NASA start a program to train black workers. In the end, NASA agreed and started a training program in collaboration with Alabama A&M; University. That the program in a way continued segregation was of secondary concern to Foster. At the end of the 1960s he persuaded Wernher von Braun, who had worked in Nazi Germany's rocket development program and later headed the Marshall Center, to support him in setting up a Computer Science program at Alabama A&M.; The university initially was not interested, being more focused on more traditional training in nursing, education, and farming, besides civil engineering. Foster persisted, and in 1968 he became the director of Alabama A&M;'s Computer Science Department (until 1970), and established the program's undergraduate degree; NASA paid his salary for those two years. In 1972, Foster joined the Equal Opportunity Office at Marshall, as a staff officer, and in 1975 he became the office's director. His job was to ensure that all the Center's operations and its contractors provided equal opportunity. He retired in 1986. In this capacity, and through the establishment of training programs, he helped hundreds of African-Americans become employed by NASA. Foster died on March 6, 2017. Other activities Foster was mayor of Triana, Alabama, a settlement of less than a hundred African-American families near Huntsville. The town had collapsed after the re-routing of a railroad to bypass it. Foster came to know the community after he met his future wife Dorothy in college; she lived in Triana, and he moved there after coming to work for NASA. Eight years after moving there, he managed to sway a probate judge to revive the municipality, having discovered that its municipal charter had never actually been dissolved and that Alabama law allowed such still-chartered municipalities to be revived. The judge subsequently named Foster mayor, and appointed a city council. A feature article in Ebony credited Foster with reviving the town, which he hoped would share in the development book prompted in part by NASA. He was mayor for twenty years, from 1964 until September 1984. He also served on the state's Commission on Higher Education, on an appointment made in 1974 by Alabama Governor George C. Wallace. With his to-be life-long friends Alonzo Toney and George Malone, in 1972 he co-founded Triana Industries, an electronics manufacturer with himself as president and 28 employees. Toney was the company vice-president and also the operations manager of the Alabama A&M Computer Services Center, and in 1984 later succeeded Foster as mayor of Triana. Malone was the general manager of Triana Industries. In 1981 Foster was awarded the Philip A. Hart Award for his \\"significant contribution toward improving urban and working environments\\". He was one of the plaintiffs in the 1980s lawsuits filed against Olin Corporation over DDT pollution in Triana.

She was responsible for the growth of philanthropic organizations focused on helping women and children in the first half of the 19th century, many of which were highly successful and trained thousands of students.  Early life  Joanna Graham Bethune was born to Isabella and Dr. John Graham at Fort Niagara on February 1, 1770 in Canada. After Dr. Graham's death in 1773, Bethune moved with her family to Scotland, where she was raised by her mother.Benson 138. Bethune attended school at Paisley and Edinburgh until she was thirteen years old when a friend of her mother paid for her to attend a French school in Rotterdam for two years. After studying to become a teacher, she moved with her family once again to New York where she became a teacher at her mother's school at the age of 19.Becker 328.  Personal life  Bethune was a deeply religious Christian, having been a member of the Cedar Street Presbyterian Church. She took her religious duties so seriously as to reject the proposal of a man who criticized her for \\"excessive\\" church attendance. Under her mother's suggestion she married a Scottish merchant named Divie Bethune, a man who at first was broke upon entering New York but over time gained considerable wealth. Like Joanna, Divie was also a devout Christian, and the two were married after Mrs. Graham's suggestion. After her marriage Bethune turned her focus to charity work. She had helped her mother start the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children which was her earliest work as a philanthropist.Gilman 59. With her husband's financial backing she was able to start her own organizations for helping needy children.Becker 329. Divie continued to encourage and back Joanna up in her pursuit to create and run charities and schools throughout their marriage. The couple had six children together,Miller 46. three of whom lived to adulthood and were named Jessie, Isabella, and George.Benson 139. Before her death, Mrs. Graham asked her daughter to focus her efforts on helping children and to \\"leave the work with widows to others\\".Becker 332. Divie died on September 18, 1824,Townsend 22. and Joanna died on July 29, 1860.Becker 333.  Organizations founded and their achievements  = Orphan Asylum Society = After seeing the poor conditions and standards in the almshouses that children were often sent to, Bethune suggested the idea of creating a shelter to nurture and educate children. With her husband's support and financial backing, she helped found the Orphan Asylum Society, with its own standards of taking care of children. The major goal of the Society was to provide a safe, clean living environment for the orphans and to educate them to be ready to work hard to contribute to society as adults.Becker 330. The Society was highly successful in training orphaned children for jobs and it had a positive response from the public. The New York State gave financial aid to the society and led it to becoming a prime example for charitable organizations, inspiring the creation of other charities.Becker 331. = Infant School Society = In July 1827, Bethune opened New York's first infant school. She became the supervisor of the Infant School Society and worked to teach younger children. = Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children = Bethune helped her mother open and run this organization though her mother later told to her to focus on children instead of widows. = Federal Union Society For the Promotion of Sabbath Schools = Divie inspired his wife to gather other women to form a system of Sunday schools modeled after the ones in England after being turned down by local ministers. Behtune said \\"My dear wife, there is no use in waiting for the men; do you gather a few ladies of different denominations, and begin the work yourselves\\". The Federal Union Society For the Promotion of Sabbath Schools was established and Bethune became the administrator. This Society was successful just like the Orphan Asylum Society had been; producing twenty-one schools with over eight thousand students. Later on the New York Sunday School Union (a union made up of men) integrated the Society and Bethune eventually lost her position as the leader. = Society for the Promotion of Industry Among the Poor = In 1814 Bethune initiated the Society for the Promotion of Industry Among the Poor to give work to people suffering from the struggles brought on by the War of 1812. The Society gave jobs to 500 women.

Set during the 25th century BC on a prehistoric South America, players assume the role of a warrior commanding his dinosaur companion as he enters a tournament held by the current titular king in order to become the next ruler while facing matches against other rivals. Its gameplay consists of one-on-one fights, with a main three-button configuration, featuring special moves and combo techniques. Produced under the working title \\"Project D-Rex\\", Dino Rex was created by most of the same team behind Gun Frontier and Metal Black, including director Takatsuna Senba and was originally intended to be a shoot 'em up game but it was instead retooled into a fighting title due to the success of games like Capcom's 1991 Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. It is notable for using stop motion animation for each of its dinosaur fighters, predating Atari Games' 1994 Primal Rage two years prior. Initially launched for the arcades, it was later re-released only in Japan under the compilation for PlayStation 2 titled Taito Memories II J≈çkan on 25 January 2007. Dino Rex has been met with negative reception from reviewers since its release, who criticized aspects such as the visuals, controls and difficulty.  Gameplay  Arcade version screenshot. Dino Rex is a fighting game featuring digitized sprites similar to Primal Rage and Reikai D≈çshi, where the player fights against other opponents in one-on- one matches and the fighter who manages to deplete the health bar of the opponent wins the first bout and the first person to win two bouts becomes the winner of the match. Each round is timed and if both fighters still have health remaining when time expires, the fighter with more health wins the round. After winning a number of matches, players are induced into a dream sequence that acts as a bonus stage, where the main objective is to decimate a city in the present time. When playing solo, players assume the role of a warrior, can choose from six playable dinosaurs and fight against computer- controlled fighters, with each one having their own special moves that are performed by entering button commands while moving the joystick. If all of the opponents are defeated, the player will be able to fight against the titular king in order to become the next ruler. A notable feature is the ability to restore health by holding up. Another notable gameplay feature is the power meter, which can be increased three times in a row to perform combos. If the player loses two bouts in a row, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Synopsis  = Plot = Dino Rex begins in the present day, where archaeologists unearthed clay figures of a man riding a dinosaur on ruins located in South America, indicating that both man and dinosaurs coexisted together in a world controlled by Amazones where men from multiple tribes fought for a queen once a year, with one of them proving his dinosaur companion to be much stronger than those from other opponents that he managed to obtain the queen and eventually become the titular king. Players assume the role of a warrior commanding his dinosaur companion as he enters a tournament held by the current king in order to become the next ruler by facing other rivals before arriving at the Auy√°n-tepui for the last match. = Dinosaurs = * Allosaurus * Ceratosaurus * Tyrannosaurus * Triceratops * Pachycephalosaurus * Stygimoloch  Development and release  Dino Rex was created by most of the same team behind Gun Frontier and Metal Black at Taito, including director Takatsuna Senba and was originally intended to be a helicopter-themed shoot 'em up game, however due to the success of games like Street Fighter II: The World Warrior from Capcom, the project was retooled into a fighting title instead under the working name \\"Project D-Rex\\". Senba and his team made use of hand-drawn animations and graphics, as well as crafted model figures of the dinosaur fighters that were then filmed through the process of stop motion animation, preceding Primal Rage by Atari Games two years prior.

Johnson, starring Scott Adkins, Craig Fairbrass, and Thomas Turgoose. The film follows Cain Burgess, a prisoner who escapes police custody after his mother's death and visits a private bar, holding its members hostage as he starts revealing his past and what led to him becoming a violent fighter. Avengement was released on 24 May 2019 on VOD and in selected theatres. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the action sequences and Adkins' performance. In 2020, a special edition was released, containing an uncut version of the film. Plot Prisoner Cain Burgess is being escorted by police to a hospital where he learns of his mother's death. After seeing her corpse, he fights off the cops and escapes their custody. He then visits a private bar, entering it after attacking the bouncers. While having his drink, he overhears one of the patrons named Tune describe how an unknown assailant killed a fellow gangster named Rook. Cain intervenes with his laughter, only to invite the wrath of Tune, his fellow patrons and Bez, the bartender. Claiming himself to be a friend of Lincoln, the owner of the bar, he tells everyone he'd walk away after finishing his drink, but gets into a brawl, acquires a double-barreled shotgun and holds everyone hostage. Soon, Lincoln's lieutenant Hyde arrives, recognizes Cain as Lincoln's brother and is also held hostage. One of the patrons trying to intervene is shot in the kneecap by Cain, who blames Hyde and Lincoln for his condition. Cain then starts narrating what caused him to become a violent fighter in prison. It is revealed that Cain used to be a skilled but quick-tempered martial artist who caused Lincoln, a loan shark, and several gangsters to lose substantial amounts of money every time he wins. Seeking to invest in a legitimate business, Cain comes to Lincoln for financial help, and is pulled into the world of crime when he is asked to rob a mark who has retrieved a package from one of Lincoln's gangsters, in exchange for money. Cain succeeds in stealing the package from a middle-aged woman who pursues him and gets killed in an accident during the chase. Cain is arrested and charged with manslaughter. Detective O'Hara explains that Lincoln's scam baits marks into acting as a bagman to forgive their debts. Lincoln arranges for someone to steal the bag, causing the mark to owe Lincoln even more money than before. When Cain refuses to cooperate with the police, a corrupt cop, Sgt. Evans, beats him up. Despite his clean record, Cain is sentenced to England's most violent prison where he gets into several fights and sustains severe injuries to his teeth and face. Despite fighting in self-defense, his sentence is repeatedly extended and this prompts him to become a cold-blooded killer in order to survive. After several years, one of his attackers reveal Lincoln has put a large bounty on his head. O'Hara, who has since learned about the bounty, once again asks Cain to give up his brother. Cain agrees on the condition that he be allowed to visit his dying mother at a hospital. They are too late, and Cain misses his chance but escapes custody after violently beating the police officers who delayed his visit. By night, Lincoln arrives and is similarly threatened by Cain. Lincoln appeals to Cain's better nature, not realizing the changes he has been forced to undergo. Hyde mocks Cain and insults the people they conned. Enraged at his flippant attitude at destroying so many lives, including his own, Cain shoots and kills Hyde in front of the others. Realizing that Cain has changed, Lincoln drops his pretenses and admits to ordering a hit. Cain angrily says that he never spoke to the police and that Sgt. Evans admitted to spreading the false rumor before Cain killed him. Although surprised at the viciousness of Cain's vengeance, Lincoln says he never even cared whether it was true; the real reason he ordered the hit on Cain was because he lost respect either way from just the rumor, which Lincoln couldn't abide. After proving that he has emptied Lincoln's bank account, Cain announces that he will now kill Lincoln, and offers to let everyone else leave. Tune leaves, but the rest are killed in the ensuing fight. Lincoln vows to recover, and, with all the guns emptied, attacks Cain with a knife. After killing him, Cain leaves behind Bez, stumbles out of the bar and collapses on a bench. In his office, Detective O'Hara discovers that Lincoln's bank account has been divided amongst his victims by Cain.

Johnson and Scott Adkins. Johnson's script was inspired by a 1962 samurai film called Harakiri by director Masaki Kobayashi. Adkins had been looking for a film project based in the United Kingdom and Johnson selected Avengement, one of his older scripts. Stu Small was brought in to rewrite the dialogue and tailor it to Adkins. Stu extensively rewrote the script, and updated older parts of the script. Shortly before filming began Johnson watched a documentary on crime in the UK and used it to add true crime elements to the story. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 82% based on reviews from 19 critics, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Avengement compensates for a lack of narrative originality with thrilling sequences of violent, bone-crunching action, elevated by Scott Adkins' brutally intense performance.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 63% based on reviews from 5 critics. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"Director Jesse V. Johnson sprinkles in enough cruel twists of fate and melancholy-laced flashbacks to prevent Avengement from becoming just another disposable exercise in action sadism on a budget. The real credit, though, goes to Adkins, who one of these days will hopefully get called up to the Hollywood big leagues and wind up surprising a lot of people ‚Äî and grin while he‚Äôs doing it.\\" Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Avengement features a good balance of colorfully profane British gangster-speak and intense, explicitly gory punch-outs.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"Portraying his most complex character to date, Adkins delivers a ferocious turn that proves visceral in its emotional as well as physical intensity.\\" References External links * Category:2019 films Category:2019 action films Category:British action films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:British films about revenge Category:Films about criminals Category:Films about brothers Category:Films set in England Category:British prison films ","title":"Avengement"},{"id":"61240058","text":"Paymaster-Captain Basil Frederick Hood (20 September 1886 ‚Äì 10 January 1941) was a senior officer in the Royal Navy.Obituary in The Times, Paymaster Captain B.F.

History Archeological research on the substructures over the past 70 years has revealed evidence of new structures, predating the palace by two centries.https://www.mgst.net/dioklecijanovi-podrumi/ These early Imperial Period walls are not yet fully understood. There is also an extensive network of water wells (later used in Middle Ages). During the later Roman empire, the function of the cellars was partly to elevate the Emperor's chambers on the floor above, but they were also the storage area for foodstuffs and wine for the Palace.https://www.total-croatia-news.com/tourist-sites/10190-sites-in- split-the-cellars-of-diocletians-palace Actually, a remnant of a large press, which was used in the wine production is still visible, and on display today. Being structurally a faithful replica of the chambers above, they enable a faithful reconstruction of the way the Emperor's chambers may have looked during the first stage of the palace. The surface area of the cellars is about an eighth of the entire palace. The cellars also contained a nymphaeum and a marble table (mensa) from the Emperor's dining room. In the early Middle Ages, as refugees made their homes behind the safety of the palace walls, a part of the underground complex was used as a residential area. Remains of this adaptation specific housing conditions during the Middle Ages are seen in the yard (15A). In one of the halls, wine and oil were produced as the remains of an ancient oil and wine press (turnjaƒçica) were found (remaining exhibited in the same spot to this day). Later the cellars were turned into a water storage facility. The old monastery and church of St. Klare, was located above the eastern section of the cellars. It is suggested that the eastern section of the cellars partially collapsed during this time, and resulting in the destruction of the monastery. In time, the cellars were almost forgotten, being filled in with waste material from the upper floors. However awareness of them (in Split at least) seems to have lasted, the old Split name for the substructures is \\"Grote\\" and seems the locals came to view them as a place to fear and respect, as popular belief had it they had been the dungeons where the Emperor Diocletian tortured Christians during his Persecutions. However, some more affluent Splinchians who had houses above them sometimes brock through their vaults and redesigned them into their own storerooms and basement spaces. In the 19th century, work began, to excavate, drain and clear the collapsed sections of the Cellars, by architect and conservationist Vicko Andriƒá, the first Split and Croatian conservationist. The work continued through 1950's when the basement's western halls were open to the public in 1959, while those of the eastern part, with the completion of extensive restoration and conservation, works only completed and opened to the public in 1996. Today the cellars are accessible through the Bronze Gate, or through a staircase from the Peristyle. The Western part of the basement has been preserved in its entirety and is almost completely accessible for sightseeing, used as an attractive fair and exhibition space. The Eastern part has collapsed, most likely during Middle Age, however, it has since been excavated and a large part is also accessible. Description The cellars entrance starts/terminates at the Cardo maximus within the palace, approaching from the peristyle and the Porta Aenea. The massive barrel-vaulted cellars are shaped in the construction of the Palace in a downward-facing position to level the southern, residential part of the Palace with other parts of the Palace. Their spaces have a variety of forms: basilic, central, central - cross, rectangular, etc. The walls served them as the basis of Imperial dwelling buildings above them, and their forms of space probably coincided with the shape of those buildings that disappeared by molding houses and streets of Split in the Middle Ages.

It resulted in the coronation of the Duke of Saxony Lothair of Supplinburg as the King of the Romans by the Archbishop of Mainz, Adalbert on 13 September in Aachen.  Sources  The events during the election are preserved in most detail in the Narratio de electione Lotharii Saxoniae ducis in regem Romanorum (Account of the Election of Lothair of Saxony as King of the Romans), which was written by an unknown eye-witness, probably a monk at G√∂ttweig Abbey, where the manuscript of the text was found. The manuscript was produced in the middle of the 12th century and thus at least twenty-five years after the events it describes. The detailed content of the account and the author's unawareness of the conflict between Lothair and the Staufen brothers Frederick II and Conrad III indicates that the original text was written before the end of 1125 and that the surviving manuscript must be a copy of it.Heinz Stoob, \\"Zur K√∂nigswahl Lothars von Sachsen im Jahre 1125,\\" Historische Forschungen f√ºr Walter Schlesinger, edited by Helmut Beumann, K√∂ln/Wien 1974, p. 444. Further accounts of events during the election are provided by the Orderic Vitalis and Otto of Freising.  Background  Grave of Henry V in the cathedral of Speyer. Archbishop Adalbert, advisor of the last Salian emperor Henry V, came into opposition to him during the Investiture Controversy by 1112 at the latest and made contact with the Saxon dukes who were opponents of Henry.Wolfgang Petke, Kanzlei, Kapelle und K√∂nigliche Kurie unter Lothar III. (1125‚Äì1137), Beihefte zu J. F. B√∂hmer, Regesta Imperii. Bd. 5, K√∂ln/Wien 1985, p. 273. Adalbert was imprisoned for three years and then continued his opposition to Henry V until he was compensated by the Emperor in the Concordat of Worms in 1122. Lothair remained an open enemy of the Salians and the Staufens.Wolfgang Petke, Kanzlei, Kapelle und K√∂nigliche Kurie unter Lothar III. (1125‚Äì1137), Beihefte zu J. F. B√∂hmer, Regesta Imperii. Bd. 5, K√∂ln/Wien 1985, pp. 278‚Äì279. Henry V died on 23 May 1125. His will left his personal property to his nephew Duke Frederick II von Staufen of Swabia, but placed the Imperial regalia in the care of his wife Empress Matilda at Trifels Castle until an imperial election could be held.Otto von Freising, Gesta Frederici seu rectius cronica / Die Taten Friedrichs oder richtiger Cronica, edited by Franz-Josef Schmale, 2nd edition, Darmstadt 1965, p. 156; Ekkehard von Aura, Frutolfi et Ekkehardi chronica necnon anonymi chronica imperatorum / Frutolfs und Ekkehards Chroniken und die anonyme Kaiserchronik, translated and edited by Franz-Josef Schmale and Irene Schmale-Ott, Darmstadt 1972, p. 374. As Archchancellor and highest-ranking prince of the Empire, Archbishop Adalbert I was in charge of preparing and presiding over the election. At Henry's funeral, which probably took place in Speyer in June, the anti-Salian attitude of Adalbert became clear. He desired a free election in which Duke Frederick II's succession would not be a foregone conclusion. Otto von Freising and Ordericus Vitalis report that Adalbert took the Imperial regalia from Matilda in preparation for the Imperial election.Otto von Freising, Gesta Frederici seu rectius cronica / Die Taten Friedrichs oder richtiger Cronica, edited by Franz-Josef Schmale, 2nd edition, Darmstadt 1965, p. 156; Ordericus Vitalis, The ecclesiastical history of Orderdic Vitalis. Books XI, XII and XIII, edited by Marjorie Chibnall, Oxford 1978, pp. 360/362.  Candidates  Image of Frederick in the Chronica sancti Pantaleonis The electoral system chosen by Adalbert was a recent innovation, first used in the election of the Abbot of Zwiefalten Abbey in 1095, which was called the Electio per compromissum (Election through compromise), in which there would be ten candidates from each of the provinces of Bavaria, Swabia, Franconia, and Saxony and they would all have to reach an agreement on a single candidate.Narratio de electione Lotharii Saxoniae ducis in regem Romanorum, edited by Wilhelm Wattenbach, MGH. SS XII, Hannover 1856, p. 510. The forty electors obviously could not agree, but three candidates were put forward: * Frederick II, Duke of Swabia, * Lothair III, Duke of Saxony, and * Leopold III, Margrave of Austria Otto von Freising records a fourth candidate, Charles I, Count of Flanders, who rejected the offer.Otto von Freising, Chronica sive historia de duabus civitatibus / Chronik oder die Geschichte der zwei Staaten, hrsg. von Walther Lammers, 3. unv. Aufl., Darmstadt 1974, p. 528. Frederick, as nephew, supporter and personal heir of the last Salian emperor could claim the strongest right to the throne and was considered the favourite. But the powerful Duke Lothair had significant support, as a long-term opponent of the Salian emperors' hostile policy toward the spiritual princes of the empire. Leopold of Austria was also linked to the Salian dynasty, since his wife Agnes of Waiblingen was a daughter of Henry IV, and he enjoyed the support of the southern German clergy.Ulrich Schmidt, K√∂nigswahl und Thronfolge im 12. Jahrhundert, K√∂ln/Wien 1987, p. 43.  Course of the election  Portrait of Lothair in the Codex Eberhardi, Fulda monastery 1150/60 Frederick, who was encamped outside the city of Mainz, did not immediately appear at the electoral assembly. After the three candidates had been named, Adalbert went to Lothair and Leopold to ask if either of them was willing to recognise one of the other candidates as king. Both agreed and simultaneously announced their renunciation of their candidature.Narratio de electione Lotharii Saxoniae ducis in regem Romanorum, edited by Wilhelm Wattenbach, MGH. SS XII, Hannover 1856, p. 510. In this way, they showed their humility and demonstrated that they were worthy of being elected as king.Ludwig Vones, \\"Der gescheiterte K√∂nigsmacher. Erzbischof Adalbert I. von Mainz und die Wahl von 1125,\\" Historisches Jahrbuch 115 (1995), pp. 101‚Äì102. According to the Narratio, Frederick believed that as a result of this announcement by the other two candidates, he was the only candidate remaining. The following day he entered the city victoriously, expecting to be elected by the assembled princes. After Frederick's arrival, Adalbert repeated the question he had asked the previous day to each candidate, but when he came to Frederick he also asked whether he was willing to renounce the designation of a successor in order to enable free elections in future. Frederick left this question unanswered and went back to his camp to consult with his associates, thereby resigning as a candidate. Subsequently, Lothair's followers riotously proclaimed him king and called on the inhabitants of the city who were assembled outside to celebrate the new king. Although many of the Bavarian princes protested at the elevation of Lothair to the kingship without an election and were demanding that an actual vote take place, Adalbert barred the doors to prevent the people of Mainz from acclaiming Lothair and to prevent the Bavarian princes from holding the vote. Then one of the Papal legates in attendance called for quiet and the Bavarian bishops declared that they could not reach a decision without Henry the Black, their Duke, who had left the assembly at the same time as Frederick II. Perhaps three days later,Ulrich Nonn, \\"Gebl√ºtsrecht, Wahlrecht, K√∂nigswahl: Die Wahl Lothars von Supplinburg 1125,\\" Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht 44 (1993), p. 156. the electors gathered once more and Lothair was elected king by the princes, including Henry the Black, who was present this time.Narratio de electione Lotharii Saxoniae ducis in regem Romanorum, edited by Wilhelm Wattenbach, MGH. SS XII, Hannover 1856, pp. 510‚Äì511. The princes then performed homage to the new king. Frederick II finally did homage two days later and Archbishop Frederick of Cologne crowned Lothair in Aachen on 13 September. Conflict had already broken out between the king and Frederick II by the end of the year.Bernd Schneidm√ºller, \\"1125 ‚Äì Unruhe als politische Kraft im mittelalterlichen Reich,\\" in Staufer & Welfen.

During the course of a professional musical career which spanned over three decades, he performed as the principal flute with several leading orchestral ensembles including the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York City. Early life and studies Nicholas Laucella was born Nicola Laucella in the town of Nusco, in the Avellino province of Italy just outside Naples. He emigrated to the United States with his family in 1895 and settled in Corona, Queens, New York. His early studies on the flute began in Italy and continued for an additional eight years after his arrival in America. During this time he also pursued professional studies in music theory, harmony, and musical composition. Laucella's primary mentor on the flute was the German soloist Carl Wehner, who served as the principal flute at the New York Philharmonic from 1892 until 1900 and as a solo flautist at the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra (1885‚Äì1886). Musical career As a young man, Laucella first performed with an orchestra at the Eden Mus√©e amusement center in New York City, which showcased musical concerts, public presentations of paintings, and motion pictures. Laucella's professional career took shape in the early 1900s when he was recruited by the Italian operatic composer Pietro Mascagni to serve as his principal flute during a concert tour in America and Canada. After returning to New York City, Laucella continued his studies on the flute with Wehner for several years. Eden Mus√©e By 1904, Laucella left New York City to accept a position playing with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra under the Austrian conductor Emil Paur. Laucella remained on staff with the orchestra for three years until 1907. During this time he also continued his musical studies under Paur's direction. After returning to New York City, Laucella was appointed to the position of principal flute at the New York Philharmonic under the musical direction of Gustav Mahler in 1909. Mahler / 1909 ‚àí 2011 New York Philharmonic He served in this capacity until 1911 and continued to perform with the orchestra until the completion of the 1918‚Äì1919 season. In addition to performing as an orchestral flautist, Laucella composed several orchestral works during this period, including Sunday at the Village (1914), Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and English Horn (1914), Prelude and Temple Dance (1915), and Whitehouse ‚Äì Impressions of Norfolk (1917). Laucella premiered his Whitehouse - Impressions of Norfolk at the annual Litchfield County Norfolk Music Festival in Norfolk, Connecticut in 1917. The composition embodies Laucella's impressions of the festival's events and was dedicated to the gracious patrons of the festival Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stoeckel, whose residence was mentioned in the title of the work. Laucella utilized a recurring theme in the chimes throughout the work in tribute to the village's Congregational Church. Critics described the composition as a rich tapestry of musical textures and The New York Times praised Laucella's fondness for Italian tunefulness. Critics at The New York Tribune described his music as both graceful and melodic. In 1911, Laucella appeared under the musical direction of the Czech conductor Josef Str√°nsk√Ω in the premiere of his symphonic poem Consalvo. Laucella dedicated his score to Str√°nsk√Ω, who became the new conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1911. The premiere of the composition was reviewed in The New Music Review, which applauded Laucella as a composer of a concise musical work with unusual promise. During this time Laucella achieved additional notoriety as a concert accompanist to the Spanish coloratura soprano Maria Barrientos during a concert tour in Worcester, Massachusetts. He also received recognition for his collaboration with the conductor Joseph Knecht and the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1916. His opera Mokanna was completed circa 1915. It incorporates a libretto by Enrico Golisciani and is based on the poem Lalla- Rookh by Thomas Moore.\\"The New York Philharmonic ‚Äì Program notes for January 1915 ‚Äì Nicola Laucella's Prelude and Temple Dance from his opera Mokanna\\" on archives.nyphil.org Based on these successful appointments, Laucella acquired the position of principal flute at the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in 1919 under the musical direction of Artur Bodanzky. He continued to serve with this orchestra under the musical direction of Tullio Serafin until 1935. During his fifteen-year tenure with the Metropolitan Opera, Laucella accompanied several operatic soloists, including Giovanni Martinelli, Lawrence Tibbett, and Giuseppe De Luca.Principal Musicians of the Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera, Biography of Nicholas Laucella on stokowski.org =Recordings= Laucella's musical talents extended beyond the operatic concert hall. During the 1920s he recorded several works for the Victor label which included arrangements by the Peruvian composer Daniel Alom√≠a Robles. As a member of the Trio Italiano ensemble, he also recorded several songs arranged for piano, guitar, flute, mandolin, and baritone. In 1930, he collaborated with the Italian Baritone Giuseppe De Luca in a recording of the flute obligato from the \\"Serenade\\" scene in the opera I gioielli della Madonna for Victor. =Death= Metropolitan Opera 1905 Laucella died on April 3, 1952.

History  = Early history = The design of the flag is thought to have derived from the arms of the ancient Welsh ruler Gwaithfoed of Ceredigion, which depicted a black lion on a field of gold. The earliest source relating to the flag can be found in John Guillim's 1611 work A Display of Heraldry which described a black lion on a yellow background belonging to ‚ÄúGwaythe Voyde, sometime Lord of Cardigan in Wales‚Äù. A similar reference to the design is noted in 1878 in The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales by Sir Bernard Burke. A black lion on a yellow field is also featured on a monument to Lewis Pryse, grand-father of Pryse Pryse, at St. Padarn's Church, Llanbadarn Fawr, on the outskirts of Aberystwyth. The relationship between the black lion on a yellow field and the influential Pryse family led to a greater adoption of the flag in the surrounding area. For example, a pub in Aberystwyth has been named 'The Black Lion' since 1851. An extract from the 1894 work of Arthur Charles Fox-Davies and M. E. B. Crookes, The Book of Public Arms, describes the county of Ceredigion as possessing no official arms, yet states that the local population of Aberystwyth recognise the \\"lion rampant regardant\\" as being the arms of the town. = Modern history = The significance of the lion rampant regardant to Ceredigion led to its inclusion as the sinister supporter alongside the red dragon of Wales on the coat of arms of Aberystwyth, awarded in 1961. The sable lion rampant regardant on an or field also featured at the 1969 investiture of Prince Charles at Caernarfon Castle. With the symbol firmly entrenched in the society and culture of Ceredigion, its inclusion in the arms awarded to Cardiganshire County Council and later to its successor Ceredigion County Council was a natural choice. However, the colours were reversed as to not usurpe the Pryse's family insignia. The administration of Dyfed also included the reverse colours of the symbol on their coat of arms to symbolise the inclusion of Ceredigion within its territory. By the late 20th century, the adoption of the reversed colours of the symbol allowed for it to be distinguished from the arms of Pryse family and had come to represent the county in its own right. The yellow lion on a black field can be found flying in settlements throughout Ceredigion, and has been used by multiple establishments in the county, such as Aberystwyth Rugby Club and Ysgol Penglais School. Yet, as of 2019 the flag has not officially been recognised as the flag of Ceredigion by the Flag Institute.  Design  The flag depicts a lion 'rampant regardant' (looking backwards) or on a field sable.

She was the first Chilean woman to earn a doctorate in education, obtained at Columbia University in 1930. Biography Irma Salas was born in Santiago on 11 March 1903, the daughter of educator and Luisa Silva Molina. She followed in her father's footsteps, becoming a noted academic administrator. She was also an advocate for women's rights and education. She died on 28 April 1987. Teaching career Salas entered the of the University of Chile, where she qualified as Professor of English in 1924. In 1927 she was sent by the government to complete her studies in the United States, where she received her doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1930. She was the first Chilean woman to earn this degree. Her thesis was titled The socionomic composition of the high school population in Chile. When she returned home, she joined the faculty of the Pedagogical Institute. She became one of the main promoters of pedagogical experimentation, taking part in the creation of the and serving as its director until 1943. There she implemented the educational principles of John Dewey. After leaving the school in 1945, she was appointed president of the commission for the renovation of the secondary school system, in charge of reformulating and rethinking Chilean secondary education. The commission proposed the creation of more experimental lyceums, beginning with six, then extending the reform to the rest. In 1953 President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo put a stop to the reform, so it was limited to the first seven schools. However, some elements of this reform, such as course councils, student centers, and chief teachers, were adopted by the Chilean secondary school system. In 1946 Salas assumed leadership of the Department of Education of the University of Chile's Faculty of Philosophy and Education. One of her professional goals was the expansion of the university to the regions of Chile. In 1960, under rector Juan G√≥mez Millas, Irma Salas implemented a program of university colleges, within the University of Chile, that offered short courses of study, in Temuco, La Serena, Osorno, Antofagasta, and other cities. In 1981 these would become public autonomous universities. Work for women's rights In 1931, just after the fall of Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, Salas participated in the creation of the Association of University Women, within which she served as secretary of the first board of directors. The organization, which sought to extend and improve the cultural, economic, civic, and social opportunities of professional women and raise the living conditions of women in general, was driven mainly by Amanda Labarca, with Ernestina P√©rez as president and Labarca and lawyer Elena Caffarena as vice-presidents. In 1946 Salas reported, during the celebration of International Women's Day in the , as a member of the Association of University Women, on the Women's Congress, held in Paris in 1945. In her speech she stated that \\"women had participated actively in the war effort, which had given them a new self-awareness and respect,\\" and that they had learned \\"to convert the principles of democracy into reality for women\\". Honors In 1953 Salas was appointed a UNESCO permanent specialist in education. In 1983 she received the Andr√©s Bello Inter-American Prize for Education, presented by the Organization of American States. The jury recognized The University of Chile awarded her the title of doctor honoris causa in 1981. An elementary school, Escuela Irma Salas Silva, was named in her honor in Conc√≥n.

Dana showed promise early in her life as a gifted painter, studying at acclaimed art schools and learning under masters in the style of impressionism. Her artwork and legacy, which went relatively unnoticed during her lifetime, has gained greater recognition in the decades following her death. Early life and training Fra Broadwell was born on November 26, 1874 to Julia and John Broadwell in Terre Haute, Indiana. Three years after Fra's birth, Julia Broadwell divorced John Broadwell and relocated with her daughter to Rockville, Indiana, where Fra lived until she was 16 years old. It was in Rockville that Julia Broadwell met and married James Dinwiddie, who became Fra's stepfather and supporter of her dreams as an artist. Fra Dana was then sent to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1890 to study painting at the Cincinnati Art Academy with Joseph H. Sharp. From 1896 to 1900, Dana studied under acclaimed artist William Merritt Chase in New York City at the prestigious Chase School and the New York School of Art. During her years working with Chase, Dana left an undeniable impression on her mentor, as evidenced in his Portrait of Mrs. Dana. Later, she studied art in Paris under Alfred Maurer and Mary Cassatt. Following James Dinwiddie's death in 1890, Dana's mother remarried to James' brother, William Colfax Dinwiddie, and relocated to Dayton, Wyoming. Dana made her second trip to Wyoming to visit her family in 1893, around which time she met her future husband: cattle rancher, Edwin Lester Dana. Marriage Fra and Edwin married July 1, 1896. The couple lived on the 2A Ranch in Big Horn County, Montana, on the Crow Indian Reservation, just over the state line from Parkman, Wyoming until moving to Great Falls, Montana in 1937. Edwin Dana had been a cattle rancher most of his life, buying his own Hereford cattle herd for $150 in 1887. By 1918, the Danas ranch was home to one of the largest Hereford cattle herds in the United States on a ranch of 400,000 acres. Along with her art, Fra helped Edwin with ranch work while also serving as his secretary and bookkeeper for the business. Although at times feeling confined to the demands of ranch life, Fra Dana continued traveling across the world to continue an informal education and experience the high culture that she had grown accustomed to in her youth. Sometimes she would be accompanied with her husband but, more often than not, Fra would travel the world on her own in a time when it was uncommon for married women to travel alone. Later years Following a mental breakdown in 1911 while on her own in New York City, Dana's physical and mental health began to decline. After this period, Edwin began traveling with her on more occasions, but her health seemed to stabilize for a period. In 1937, she moved to Great Falls, Montana while her husband remained ranching at their second ranch in Cascade County, Montana, roughly 50 miles apart. Fra Dana began to grow frail with what turned out to be cancer. Edwin Dana died in Great Falls on December 14, 1946 at the age of 82. At the end of her life, Fra Dana willed many of her personal artworks and those in her collection to the University of Montana. Fra Dana died December 1, 1948, in Great Falls, Montana, at the age of 74. Fra's life and artwork, although relatively obscure during her lifetime, garnered greater recognition in the final few years of her life and following her death.

She gained a Bachelor in Design from Massey University, New Zealand, in 1999 and, following a move to Australia, earned a Master of Fine Arts from the National Art School, Sydney, in 2014. Between 2008‚Äì12 she was Project Coordinator at MAY‚ÄôS ‚Äì The May Lane Street Art Project, Sydney. Her academic teaching career included positions as Lecturer in Fine Art Printmaking at the National Art School, Sydney between 2010‚Äì15, and Lecturer in Printmedia at the Sydney College of the Arts between 2011‚Äì12 and from 2015‚Äì19. Wendy Murray was a consultant researcher in Geography and Urban Studies at the University of Western Sydney during 2013‚Äì14.Wendy Murray ‚Äì Artist and Arts Educator (website), www.wendymurray.com.au Work as Mini Graff The streets and inhabitants of Sydney's urban fringe provide the content and impetus for her work. Mini Graff stenciled and printed images onto a variety of media (walls, boards, vinyl, paper, rarely canvas) which strongly relate to the given environment and community, transforming an anonymous repetitive urban landscape into a unique and personal aesthetic experience. Parody, humor and social commentary are common themes in Graff's work ‚Äì notions that are translated into experiments with scale in public space ‚Äì from discrete interventions to large-scale installations. Graff has participated in several public art projects including Sydney Art and About, plus coordinated and presented numerous printmaking workshops to various audience groups including high school students, tertiary institutions and public art galleries. Graff's recent Suburban Roadhouse series explores concepts of trademark and ownership in public/domestic space. Mini Graff is featured in the video for Deepchild's song \\"Blackness of the Sea\\".Blackness of the Sea = Techniques = Mini Graff's primary medium is handcut stencils transferred with aerosol paint or daubed with sponges. Her installations range from single colour, single stencil works to multiple stencils and colours incorporating 3D elements such as handcut butterflies, plastic figures of people and model houses. Depending on the nature and exposure of the site, Mini Graff also pre- prints onto paper, stickers and wallpaper, and hangs them in the place of painted stencils. Mini Graff's recent work has expanded into exploring colour and abstract patterns using brightly coloured adhesive vinyl strips to draw pedestrians' attention to common street structures. Her work demonstrates how a simple treatment applied to an object rendered invisible by familiarity, such as a sign post, can return it to our awareness.

Playing career He loved to play football from an early age, and when he was nine years old, he was spotted by local regional legend Velimir Sombolac who brought him to FK Kozara Gradi≈°ka where he was incorporated into the youth team. Raca would successfully climb all age levels making his debut for the first team at the age of 17. His first highlight came in 1994 when coach Borƒçe Sredojeviƒá under extremely harsh circumstances managed to create an ideal synergy of youth and experience and made Raca win his first major title, the 1993‚Äì94 Republika Srpska Cup. This drew attention from other major regional clubs towards these players.Sa≈°a Raca: Djecu treba vaspitavati da budu ljudi at pravdabl.com/, 2-4-2016, 8-7-2019 Two years later, Raca received a call from maximally ambitious FK Obiliƒá, a club at the time owned by ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænjatoviƒá Arkan who had decided to turn a lower-league club in a succession of promotions to a national champion in record time. However, although Raca did move to Serbia, he signed with another top-league club, FK Mladost Apatin. His performance during the year and a half in Apatin did not pass unnoticed with Raca being rumoured to move to giants Red Star and Partizan Belgrade. Circumstances make Raca join FK Zemun, a stable club with plenty of tradition. By his own words, it ended being the best decision as he had the chance to be at the club when a great group of players were together and were all lucky to have been coached by names such as Mile Tomiƒá, Ivan ƒåabrinoviƒá, Milan Milanoviƒá, Bogiƒá Bogieviƒá, ƒåedo ƒêoinƒçeviƒá, and others. Raca played over 100 official games for Zemun. After two years in Zemun some foreign clubs had shown interest in signing him, mostly Europeans, but Raca turned totally to the opposite direction after Serbian coach Ljupko Petroviƒá convinced him to join him in Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua. Chinese football was already rising at that time when Raca signed a one-year contract which was further extended one more year. Raca happily accepted since coincidentally the departure of coach Petroviƒá in between seasons had brought another Serbian coach, also well known, Ilija Petkoviƒá. What Raca found most impressive in China is that all games had between 30 and 70 thousand spectators. When the two-year contract expired. Raca returned to Serbia and rejoined FK Zemun.Sasa Raca at dekisa.tripod.com (many errors, used just for stats of that season) However, after only a six months, he received a call from Svetozar ≈†apuriƒá who was coaching Ethnikos Achna in Cyprus and wanted him in his team. After a good season, he received an offer from APOEL FC coached back then by Ivica Jovanoviƒá. However, after a good start, Raca suffered a serious knee-injury which demanded 3 surgeries and a year out of action. This was devastating for Raca which despite following strictly the medical recommendations to fully recover as soon as possible, once recovered he declined some offers he had as doctors were clear claiming any further injury could have a heavy impact on his life. Feeling homesick, Raca returns to Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and helps his original club, Kozara, which was going through some rough times. Without risking too much physically, it is his technique, experience, and leadership attitude that were useful to the club to impose some discipline in the squad. Raca still played actively for two full seasons with Kozara before deciding to retire for good. Immediately after retiring he accepted to stay with the club and became sports director. However, different ideas and concepts between him and the club board made Raca resign after only 6 months, and he then started his own project, football school called FK Stars.

The service launched on May 27, 2020. HBO Max is based on WarnerMedia's HBO premium TV service and includes all of its programming, plus a range of additional original programming and library content from all parts of WarnerMedia, as well as third-party content providers from which WarnerMedia bought streaming rights. According to AT&T;, HBO Max had garnered 4.1 million activated subscribers by the end of June 2020, 1.1 million of whom get free access through HBO pay TV subscriptions; there are at least 21 million additional HBO pay TV customers whose subscriptions make them eligible for free access to HBO Max but who had not activated the service by that time. History On October 10, 2018, WarnerMedia announced that it would launch an over-the-top streaming service in late 2019, featuring content from its entertainment brands. The original plan for the service called for three tiers with a late 2019 launch. Randall L. Stephenson, chairman and CEO of WarnerMedia's parent, AT&T; indicated in mid-May 2019 that it would use the HBO brand and would tie into cable operators as HBO cable subscribers would have access to the streaming service. A beta was expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 and full launch in first quarter 2020 at the time. Otter Media was transferred in May 2019 to WarnerMedia Entertainment from Warner Bros. to take over the streaming service as Brad Bentley, executive vice president and general manager of the direct-to-consumer development exited the post after six months. Andy Forssell transferred from being chief operating officer of Otter to replace Bentley as executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter CEO Tony Goncalves, who would lead development. On July 9, 2019, WarnerMedia announced that the service would be known as HBO Max, and would launch in spring 2020, while Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine and Greg Berlanti were signed to production deals for the service. (The \\"Max\\" moniker is shared with HBO's sister linear pay TV service Cinemax, which has alternately identified by its suffix name since the mid-1980s and used it prominently in its branding from 2008 to 2011.) On October 29, 2019, it was announced that HBO Max would officially launch in May 2020. On January 8, 2020, AT&T; announced that Audience, a channel exclusive to subscribers of AT&T-owned; TV providers such as DirecTV with some original programming, would be sunset on May 22, eventually transitioning to a barker channel for HBO Max. Warner Bros. and HBO Max announced the Warner Max film label on February 5, 2020, which would produce eight to ten mid-budget movies per year for the streaming service starting in 2020. On April 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced HBO Max's launch date as May 27. Management HBO Max was formed under WarnerMedia's Entertainment division, then headed by Robert Greenblatt. Kevin Reilly, president of WarnerMedia Entertainment Networks which includes most of the company's ad-supported entertainment channels such as TBS, TNT, and TruTV, was also given the role of as chief content officer of HBO Max with responsibility for HBO Max-exclusive original programming and library content. Andy Forssell was named the service's executive vice president and general manager while still reporting to Otter Media CEO Tony Goncalves, who leads development. Casey Bloys, programming president of HBO, retained oversight of the core HBO service but was not initially involved with Max-exclusive programming. On August 7, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a major restructuring under new president Jason Kilar, which he described as \\"leaning into this great moment of change\\" towards direct-to-consumer services. As a result, Greenblatt and Reilly both left the company, and WarnerMedia Entertainment was dissolved, with programming operations combined with Warner Bros. in a new Studios and Networks group under that studio's CEO Ann Sarnoff. Bloys was given full programming oversight of HBO and HBO Max, as well as Reilly's other previous responsibilities, reporting to Sarnoff. Forssell became the head of a new HBO Max operating business unit, reporting directly to Kilar. Content WarnerMedia indicated that the service would have 10,000 hours of content at- launch, including first-run and library content from the namesake HBO (including its original series, documentaries, and specials), and content from the company's other brands and networks. WarnerMedia stated that the service would have over 2,000 films available at-launch, including HBO's existing pay television rights that are sourced from studios including sister company Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures, and 20th Century Studios (the latter two have respective output deals with HBO until 2022; films from 20th Century will likely move to Disney+ and Hulu once its output deal expire, while future rights to Universal films are still up for negotiation despite the launch of Peacock). As with HBO's existing streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now (but as opposed to its platforms on Apple TV Channels and Amazon Video Channels), HBO Max is not expected to include feeds of HBO's linear cable channels, nor is it expected to include any content (including original programming) from Cinemax, which will concurrently wind down its original programming efforts as WarnerMedia reallocates its programming investments towards HBO Max. (Cinemax shares its film content with the linear HBO channel, and therefore the majority of films in the combined library will be on both services in different windows, but films will not necessarily be available on both HBO Max and Cinemax at the same time.) AT&T; chairman and CEO Randall L. Stephenson has not ruled out adding live content from Turner Sports in the future (such as the NBA on TNT, Major League Baseball on TBS, and NCAA March Madness). = Content providers = First and third party content providers for HBO Max.

Original episodic content is released weekly, eschewing the \\"binge\\" format made popular by Netflix. Kevin Reilly stated this was to ensure that originals would remain in the spotlight for extended periods, by letting said shows \\"breathe\\" as opposed to \\"fading quickly after a binge and burn\\". He also noted that the weekly schedule helped to drive the success of past HBO shows like Succession and Chernobyl which they co-produced with Sky UK, and became hits precisely due to their staying power. On February 5, 2020, Warner Bros. announced that it would form a new label known as Warner Max to produce 8 to 10 mid-budget films for the service annually. A slate of 31 original series were planned for its first year, with plans to expand to 50 for its next year, but production timelines may have been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. HBO Max also has podcasts about the films and TV series on the service. =Syndication= New Warner Bros. Television-produced series that have premiered on The CW since the 2019‚Äì20 season (beginning with Batwoman and Katy Keene (which was cancelled in July 2020)) will have their past seasons placed on HBO Max a month before the newest season premieres on TV (streaming rights to existing series remains with Netflix under an existing deal). On July 9, 2019, HBO Max acquired the U.S. streaming rights to Friends in a $425 million deal, and on September 17, 2019, acquired the U.S. streaming rights to The Big Bang Theory, as part of a deal that also extends TBS's off-network rights to the series through 2028. =Acquired rights= Outside of WarnerMedia, the service also offers titles from The Criterion Collection, and has a long-term partnership with BBC Studios (which HBO had previously partnered with to create His Dark Materials). Over 700 episodes of BBC content are slated to be available on the service at launch, including the first 11 seasons of the 2005 Doctor Who revival, as well as future seasons twelve through fourteen, and a variety of other shows including The Honourable Woman, Luther, Top Gear, and the original British version of The Office. Additionally, future shows by BBC Studios will be co-produced with HBO Max. HBO also extended their existing partnership with Sesame Workshop, while moving said content to the front of the HBO Max brand. Select episodes from all fifty seasons of Sesame Street (dating back to 1969) are available to stream on the service for the first time ever. Additionally, future seasons of Sesame Street will stream exclusively on HBO Max, alongside Esme & Roy, and several new spin-offs starting with The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo, Mecha Builders, and The Monster at the End of This Story. HBO Max has acquired the streaming rights to several Comedy Central series, including South Park, Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens, South Side, and The Other Two; with the latter two becoming Max Original series. =Animation= Western The service also features many hubs for animated programming, drawing largely from the libraries of Warner Bros. Animation (including the Looney Tunes franchise and Hanna-Barbera productions) and Cartoon Network, along with Adult Swim. Original animated series (including the Adventure Time epilogue specials Adventure Time: Distant Lands, Jellystone!, Looney Tunes Cartoons, a continuation of Infinity Train and Summer Camp Island, and a reboot of The Boondocks produced by Sony Pictures Animation) for both network sections were also announced for HBO Max, and the service beat out competitors to acquire exclusive domestic streaming rights to Trey Parker and Matt Stone's South Park and its next three seasons, in a shared deal with ViacomCBS's Comedy Central (which Warner used to own a half ownership share of Comedy Central from 1991 to 2003) for $500 million (with new episodes being added 24 hours after their premiere on Comedy Central) Anime Crunchyroll provides a growing selection of anime content for the service, curated every quarter, starting with seventeen anime. This includes Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Kill la Kill, Berserk, Your Lie in April, Re:Zero ‚àí Starting Life in Another World, Rurouni Kenshin, and the internally produced In/Spectre. In addition, Death Note and Hunter √ó Hunter are on the platform within the first year of the service. Death Note, as well as the first five episodes of Tower of God, were added on June 19, 2020 while Hunter X Hunter was added on June 23, 2020. The service is also the first U.S. service to hold streaming rights to the films of Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli, via its North American distributor GKIDS. Studio Ghibli films such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro and more became available on the service at launch. Fellow Otter Media company Rooster Teeth also contributes content, with season two of Gen:Lock to be a timed exclusive for HBO Max. =Post-launch= All eight films in the Harry Potter series were available to stream on the service on launch day, despite earlier reports indicating that the films, although produced by Warner Bros., would not be available due to a prior broadcast rights agreement with NBCUniversal. It was later announced that the films would be removed on August 25 and made available on NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock. On May 29, 2020, HBO Max acquired the exclusive streaming rights to The Big Bang Theory spin-off Young Sheldon. On June 9, 2020, Gone with the Wind was temporarily removed from HBO Max's library amid the George Floyd protests, following an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times by 12 Years a Slave screenwriter John Ridley. On June 25, 2020, the film returned in its original form with, as suggested by Ridley, a new introduction by Turner Classic Movies host Jacqueline Stewart discussing the film's treatments of the American Civil War, the Reconstruction era, and American slavery of African people. On June 27, 2020, it was revealed that DC Universe original Harley Quinn will stream its first two seasons on HBO Max. On June 29, 2020, HBO Max secured the exclusive streaming rights of the Oprah Winfrey Network series David Makes Man. On September 18, 2020, it was announced that all DC Universe content would be migrating to HBO Max, including original shows like Titans and Young Justice, which will have their newest seasons air exclusively on the service. In addition, both Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn have been renewed for third seasons exclusively for the service. Distribution =United States= The majority of active subscribers to either HBO Now or the HBO pay TV service (which includes HBO Go) at time of launch can access HBO Max for no extra charge, with all three services generally sharing the same price point of $14.99 per month. However, this transition is contingent on the customer's current provider or biller having signed a new distribution agreement for HBO Max with WarnerMedia. For certain distributors that are members of the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), access to HBO Max will be rolled out later in 2020. In announcing HBO Max, WarnerMedia immediately confirmed that HBO subscribers on AT&T-owned; platforms (including AT&T; TV, DirecTV, U-verse, and AT&T; Mobility) will receive HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. AT&T; customers who are subscribed to their highest-tiered internet, TV and wireless plans will also receive HBO Max for free, while those on lower-tiered plans will get a free trial ranging from one month to one year. Existing HBO Now subscribers billed directly by HBO were also migrated to HBO Max on-launch at no additional charge. On April 27, 2020, an agreement was announced for HBO Now subscribers via Apple (both in-app subscriptions and Apple TV Channels) to be migrated to HBO Max. Content from HBO Max will be listed in the Apple TV app along with there being a dedicated HBO Max hub in the app. On Apple TV devices, HBO Max is available to the regular fourth generation Apple TV and fifth generation Apple TV 4K; earlier versions which do not support third- party app download are not supported. WarnerMedia subsequently negotiated with other pay TV providers for similar arrangements. On February 20, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a distribution deal with YouTube TV that would allow members to add HBO and Cinemax, while also being able to include HBO Max as an add-on. On April 15, 2020, WarnerMedia announced a similar deal with Charter Spectrum (which acquired Warner's former cable division that was spun off in 2009, in May 2016) to give access to HBO Max for HBO subscribers via their TV Everywhere credentials. A similar agreement was announced with Hulu on May 1 for most existing subscribers via Hulu + Live TV, as well as being available as an add-on to all other plans on the service. On May 20, 2020, it was announced that WarnerMedia had made distribution deals with Altice USA, Cox Communications, Xbox, Samsung, PlayStation, Verizon Communications and the NCTC. An agreement with Comcast (Xfinity) was announced a few hours after the platform's launch. The two most prominent platforms without agreements to carry HBO Max are Amazon (maker of the Fire TV) and Roku, which together are estimated to control 70% of the U.S. streaming player market. On May 13, 2020, John Stankey, CEO of AT&T;, revealed to Variety that Amazon was very unlikely to become a launch partner for HBO Max; the parties have remained at an impasse following the launch, reportedly due to a disagreement about whether Amazon can host the additional Max programming directly on its Prime Video Channels platform as it does for HBO currently. The dispute with Roku is reported to hinge on carriage commissions and advertising sales on the future ad-supported tier. With both of these companies' devices, non-Max HBO content remains available as usual through the companies' respective channels platforms and/or through HBO Now. Dish Network was also erroneously mentioned as a holdout in some media reports; HBO has not been available at all from Dish since late 2018 due to a separate dispute. HBO Max does not support 4K, HDR, or Dolby Atmos, but are planned as \\"part of the HBO Max product roadmap\\". There is also no support for audio description for those with visual impairments. There are plans for HBO Max to introduce an ad-supported tier by 2021. =International= Localized versions of HBO Max are scheduled to launch in 2021 in Latin America and the parts of Europe, such as Spain and the Nordics, where HBO already directly operates premium TV or streaming services. In the interim, some HBO Max original programs will be available on WarnerMedia's existing international platforms, also including HBO Asia. In other countries, HBO programming is licensed to third-party networks and streaming services under long-term deals; many of these services, like HBO and its owner AT&T;, are owned by major pay TV service providers in their respective markets. WarnerMedia said in late 2019 that it planned to continue HBO's existing international licensing partnerships for the time being. However, as part of the WarnerMedia further restructuring announced in August 2020, WarnerMedia president Jason Kilar said HBO Max would be expanding its scope globally, without elaborating on specific new plans or timelines. Many HBO Max programs are also available in Canada through Bell Media (operator of HBO Canada and online streaming service Crave), and in Australia through Foxtel (operator of Fox Showcase and the Binge streaming service). Both Bell and Foxtel reached expanded agreements with WarnerMedia shortly before HBO Max's launch, extending their rights to HBO main-channel programming and adding most HBO Max original series produced directly by WarnerMedia, and in Foxtel's case certain WarnerMedia library series including Friends. Programs produced by third-party studios are negotiated separately; for example, rights to Love Life (produced by Lionsgate) are also held by Crave in Canada, but by Stan in Australia. Many of HBO Max's family-oriented and animated series were acquired in Canada by Corus for their Teletoon and Treehouse networks in 2020. This only applies to certain programming produced by Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios, and Sesame Workshop for which Corus had existing agreements prior to the launch of HBO Max. Meanwhile, Sky (now owned by AT&T; rival Comcast, and operator of channels including Sky Atlantic and the Now TV streaming platform) holds rights to HBO main-channel programming in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, the Republic of Ireland and Italy through 2024. Sky's most recent deal includes provisions for future HBO Max co-productions, but not necessarily other Max Originals. In all parts of Africa the South African streaming service Showmax made a several year deal with HBO to be the exclusive home of all HBO content on the continent. In France, where HBO original programming is available on OCS, St√©phane Richard, CEO of Orange, revealed in February 2020 that there will be discussions with WarnerMedia regarding HBO Max programs following the end of its current agreements with HBO in 2022. However, since then, OCS has acquired French rights to some HBO Max original programs on a case-by-case basis, including Search Party and Love Life, while others including Raised by Wolves will instead air on WarnerMedia- owned Warner TV. Reception HBO Max received mixed reception from media observers on launch. The range of available content was generally well received, but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO's other since-deprecated streaming platforms, HBO Go and HBO Now, and the service's higher subscription price compared to other newly-launched streaming platforms like Disney+. AT&T; announced in July 2020 that HBO Max had nominally achieved 26.6 million subscribers after its first month of operation, including 23.6 million wholesale customers, primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge. However, only 4.1 million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date. The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment, particularly in light of Disney+ having reached 10 million subscribers within a day of launch; The New York Times's media critic Ben Smith wrote that WarnerMedia had \\"badly botched\\" the launch. However, AT&T; executives contended that it had been a \\"flawless launch\\" citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max (36.3 million, vs. 34.6 million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of 2019), while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps. Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base, and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO's pre-existing deals (such as those with Amazon and Roku).

The West End is an area of the city of Davenport, Iowa, and is boarded by both W. 9th street, W. 8th Street, N. Marquette Street, the Mississippi River, and I-280. Its main streets are Rockingham Road, Telegraph Road, N. Division Street, and N. Marquette St. The area is also known to be \\"West Davenport\\". History The West End and its history traces back with the War of 1812 in which both the Sauks were fighting the British on what would be known as Credit Island, making the area to be first known.Major Taylors battle, March 23, 2015. IllinoisGenealogy.com Retrieved July 9, 2019 Then, on September 4‚Äì5, 1814, another Credit Island occurred with Major Zachary Taylor being the commander of the U.S. with the Indians' commander being Black Hawk, and in the end only one was killed, making the location to be a historic site for visitors. In 1832, Chief Keokuk signed a treaty to end the Black Hawk War, along with General Winfield Scott, while Antoine LeClaire, a Native himself with French descent, served as Translator. When Davenport was established in 1836 by Antoine LeClaire and named after his good friend Colonel George Davenport, the West End was also established. In 1890, the state's very first crematory happened in the nearby cemetery to Tri-City, designed by Architect Fritz Clausen, who made it in a style called \\"Richardsonian Romanesque\\". Clausen is Davenport's single most important Architect in its history. The first cremation at the place was truly a dead large sheep. Through-out the late 1800s and early 1900s, murders and suicides occurred. One such case, in which a woman by the name of Maggie Durley, was murdered by her husband, an African-American named William. Durley dumped his wife's body onto the area's rural parts, and confessed it was punishment for her., June 28, 1904 Retrieved June 28, 2019 Another case involved with a couple who both committed suicide by jumping into the Mississippi river over at Credit island. By the 1930s, the notorious period known as the \\"Great Depression\\" began to affect the West End area of Davenport, at the time called the Rockingham Township, with severe sickness, hunger, and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area. Eventually, through county and municipal government, the federal Civil Works Administration gave employment to thousands of men. More than 200 jobs were created by the construction of Lock and Dam 15 project within 1932.Svendsen, p. 153 Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936. On January 22, 1958, the old Rockingham Township loss its battle with Davenport to try to become seat of the Scott County and ultimately became part of Davenport, along with the surrounding rural area of Telegraph, W. River Drive, Rockingham Road, and S. Concord Street. At some point in 1970, Keota Avenue, below to Rockingham, was flooded. Demographics The West End's demographics is mostly White with a less percentage of African-Americans and Native Americans, with a fairly amount of those who are of Hispanic or Latino descent. The area is known within its city of having the highest amount of those who are poor to the point of being in Poverty and are uneducated since the Great Depression, either having GEDs or having no College education. Education The area consists of two Elementary Schools, Hayes and Monroe and one Intermediate school, Smart, which are a part of the Davenport Community School District. A local Community center on S. Concord Street, which is straight off of Rockingham, called Roosevelt used to be an K-6 elementary school while as then known as \\"Rockingham\\" but was changed to what it called now in 1945, as a K‚Äì3 school, and it was not until the 1997‚Äì98 schoolyear that it was closed officially and turned into a community center.= Landmarks The historic places include Credit Island, Tri-City Jewish Cemetery, the Putnam Museum, and the House at 2123 W. Second Street. The West End is also home to one of Davenport's oldest church, St. Mary's Catholic Church on 516 Fillmore St. The most well-liked Restaurant in the area is Nally's Kitchen on Rockingham close to Division, a Mexican restaurant that serves authentic Mexican food and Nally's even made its way to be on a Spanish newspaper called Hola America!.

History  The horse was admitted to Saint-Cyr in 1936. The captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque (the future Marshal Leclerc), then instructor at Saint-Cyr, participated in the military training of Iris XVI. Renowned for his difficult character, Iris XVI did not fail to disconcert his riders. Captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque owed his limp and cane to a fall from Iris XVI's back, resulting in a fractured tibia, with lifelong sequelae. This part of the history of Iris XVI remains unverifiable, due to its age. Iris XVI had become an excellent racehorse, particularly in the steeple-chase on Maisons-Laffitte racecourses. He was not ridden in the race by captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque because he was too tall and heavy. When captain Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque was deployed to Africa, the horse continued his racing career with Captain Jean Fanneau de La Horie, with whom he gained notoriety in Nazi Germany. Iris XVI was not mobilized during the Second World War, because of his notoriety or unsuitability. = Act of resistance = On June 14, 1940, Saint-Cyr was captured by the Germans. One of the German commanders asked to see the horse that had beaten him in a past race, one of his soldiers went to look for him. Iris XVI gave the soldier a violent blow with his hoof.

Marshal Leclerc de Hautecloque is said to have commented on the case by stating \\"He was as patriotic as his master.\\"  Description  Iris XVI is described as a chestnut or roan horse, very lively, with a bad character.

The interior of the church was largely renovated in the Neoclassical style in the 19th century. The church was listed as a historic structure by the National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute in 1938. History The Convent of Our Lady of the Exile was the first female convent in Brazil. Nuns of the Order of Saint Clare, the counterpart to the Franciscan order, arrived in Salvador in 1677 from the Convent of Santa Clara of √âvora, Portugal. Construction of the convent began in 1681 on the site of a small residence of the Clares. It was largely constructed due to the donation of a large fortune of Dona Ant√¥nia de G√≥is, a member of the order. Location The church and convent, now surrounded by dense residential neighborhoods, was established outside of the walls of the city of Salvador. It was located on second range of hills on the outskirts of the city and overlooked the Tororo Dyke (Dique de Tororo). The church and convent are located in close proximity to the Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne. Structure The Church and Convent of Our Lady of the Exile was built around two courtyards. Its belvedere, the first in Salvador, is typical of convents in Portugal in the 17th and 18th centuries. The complex was completed over approximately a century. Its tower was completed in the early 18th century, and is \\"crowned by one of the first and most beautiful domes in Salvador.\\" The church has a single nave, chancel, a lower choir, and upper choir. The altar has elements from the 18th century, notably 18th-century images Saint Clare and Saint Francis. Similarly to many churches in Salvador of the 19th century, its Baroque wood carvings were replaced with those of Neoclassical design.

Built in 1865 as a private residence by Edwin S. Noble (1838‚Äì1922), it was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site on April 24, 1979. Since 1949, the Island House has served as a public library within the Elk Rapids District Library. The island The Island House is centered on an island at the mouth of the Elk River leading to Grand Traverse Bay in Lake Michigan. The island itself has no official name. The Elk River flows for only a short distance at 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from its source at Elk Lake, but in that short distance, the river had numerous rapids through a seven-foot (2.1 m) drop in elevation. The island currently encompasses four acres (1.6 ha) and peaks at about 25 feet (7.6 m) above the surface. Edwin Noble radically transformed the island by covering it with clay and loam, as well as planting numerous trees. The island would soon be nicknamed \\"The Isle of Pines\\" due to the large number of trees on the island. Noble also constructed a small bridge to connect it to the mainland. The rapids were eliminated when the Elk Rapids Hydroelectric Dam was constructed in 1917, and it remains in operation. Today, the island is owned by the Village of Elk Rapids and remains open to the public as part of the Elk Rapids Harbor. It now contains several paved roads and bridges, boat launch and numerous docks, large parking lot, and park facilities. History In 1855, the Noble family moved from downstate in Washtenaw County. Henry Noble, along with business partner Wirt Dexter, began purchasing large areas of land in Elk Rapids for their growing company. The Noble-Dexter Company, which was involved primarily in pig iron smelting, became the largest employer in Elk Rapids. The company also expanded into lumbering, chemical production, and flour production. By 1882, the company evolved into the Elk Rapids Iron Company and became one of the largest iron companies in the state. In 1865, Henry's older brother Edwin moved to Elk Rapids from Dexter to work for the company and eventually gained partial control of the firm. Henry Noble and Wirt Dexter owned the small island, and Edwin wanted to build his home in this prime location. Edwin Noble constructed the small house in 1865, and it underwent numerous additions as Noble's family and wealth expanded. Rooms were added for servants, and the house eventually consisted of four bedrooms, parlor, dining room, and two bathrooms. The island was one of the most expensive and luxurious properties in Elk Rapids and was nicknamed the \\"Island of Nobility\\" due to its hosting of lavish parties and lively entertainment. The swift-moving rapids surrounding the island were perfect for powering numerous sawmills operated by the company, and the main blast furnace was not too far away. After suffering severe injuries from a boating accident in 1892, Edwin Noble was unable to work and lost controlling interest of the Elk Rapids Iron Company. Forced into financial hardships, he sold the house in 1903 to the new owners of the company from Grand Rapids. The house began to serve as a vacationing home for the company's business associates. When the nearby forests depleted and better smelting processes came about, the Elk Rapids Iron Company became obsolete and closed down around 1918. In 1926, the house became the property of Wirt Dexter's widow Josephine and eventually to their daughter Katharine McCormick, who never actually lived in the house. In 1948, Katharine deeded the island and the house to the Village of Elk Rapids. It was then used as a rental vacation home for meetings and small parties by other residents of Elk Village. The Island House Library State historic marker along River Street In 1949, the property was converted for use as a library within the Elk Rapids District Library. The library system is used to serve the residents of the village and the surrounding townships of Elk Rapids, Milton, and Torch Lake. On April 24, 1979, Elk Rapids received notification that the Island House was selected for inclusion on the state's listing as a Michigan State Historic Site. The building received a plaque, and a historic marker was erected nearby off the island on River Street in 1989. The long-defunct Elk Rapids Iron Company, which today consists of only a small ruin of the original blast furnace near the Island House, was dedicated as a Michigan State Historic Site earlier in 1973. The Island House is one of four properties on the list of Michigan State Historic Sites in Antrim County, which also includes the Elk Rapids Iron Company Informational Site (ruins of the blast furnace), Elk Rapids Township Hall, and the Hughes House‚Äîthe latter two are listed also on the National Register of Historic Places‚Äîbut the Island House is only listed on the state level. =Proposed expansion= In 2014, the library received a $400,000 donation in a will from local resident Charles Heffer, who requested that it be used to expand and improve the library system. This tremendous donation began the discussion of updating and expanding the Island House Library. Proposals were submitted, and in early 2017, Elk Rapids District Library was granted permission to build a large addition to the Island House Library, which would include the addition of a second floor and nearly double the size of the existing structure‚Äîif not completely replace the aging structure and significantly alter the island's scenic environment. Despite the property's historic nature, state historic preservation officials approved the request. Local residents objected to altering the historic structure, and protest signs reading \\"Preserve Our Island House and Property\\" began appearing around Elk Rapids. At a village council meeting in November 2017, the council voted 4‚Äì3 against the proposed additions to the 151-year-old Island House Library and requested a smaller expansion plan be submitted to appease both sides of the debate. Opponents feared that significant alterations and expansions to the original structure might forfeit the property's historical designation. The library's director, Nannette Miller, supported the proposal and sees it as a way to expand the library's capacity and its usefulness to neighboring communities. Other proponents of the expansion project believe the existing Island House Library is too small to adequately serve the surrounding communities. In September 2018, the village council of Elk Rapids voted 6‚Äì1 to approve the proposal for a 6,300 ft¬≤ (583 m¬≤) expansion to the Island House Library. Despite objections from many residents, the estimated $3.2 million project gained the approval of the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office to ensure the property does not lose its historic designation. The expansion project will significantly alter the library but will include numerous restorations to the historical elements of the structure. The project will be funded by donations. As of February 2019, $1 million has been raised. Organizers must collect $3.4 million before construction can begin, and the final cost of the expansion project has been listed at $4.7‚Äì5.0 million. Public taxes will not be used for the project, and no precise timeline has been set.

Description Eucalyptus frenchiana is a mallet that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth light grey over cream bark that is shed in ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth have slightly glossy light green leaves that are a paler colour on one side, egg-shaped and petiolate. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped, the same glossy green on both sides, long and wide and petiolate. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of three on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are long and wide, the hypanthium cup-shaped and the operculum hemispherical with prominent longitudinal ribs. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, conical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near to rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus frenchiana was first formally described in 2009 by Dean Nicolle from a specimen he collected with Malcolm French west of Coolgardie, and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (frenchiana) honours French for his assistance in the preparation of the Nuytsia paper. Distribution and habitat This mallet grows in mallet-mallee woodland near Lake Johnston in the Coolgardie biogeographic region. Conservation status Eucalyptus frenchiana is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

It was found in the Gruhalde Member of the Klettgau Formation. It was an early member of Neotheropoda with affinities to Dilophosaurus and Averostra. The new genus and species Notatesseraeraptor frickensis was named by Marion Zahner and colleagues in 2019. Since 1961, at the clay pit of Gruhalde, exploited by Tonwerke Keller, numerous fossils of Plateosaurus have been found. At a somewhat higher layer, in the spring of 2006, amateur paleontologist Michael Fisher discovered the postcranial skeleton of a small theropod. In 2009, the skull was secured. The fossils were unearthed and prepared by Ben Pabst and team. Initially the skeleton was provisionally referred to Coelophysidae.

The only problem is that the parents do not understand the attraction of the youth. The parents of the child themselves, work in the field of robotics, and dream of the fact that someday their son will follow in their footsteps. Taking into account that Mitya is still a youth and needs support, only his parents do not give him this support. But the guy could never even think about the fact that the robot could support him, and he would do it, would become his best friend and mentor. With a new hero named Robo, Mitya met unexpectedly under strange circumstances. As it turned out, the parents of Mitya, created this iron miracle, and had the marking A-112. But the engineers didn‚Äôt like something in the workshop where it was created, and they decided to write off the robot, only now Mitya does not want to give it away, and constantly protects it from everyone and hides it. From now on, this fun and friendly couple will have a bunch of adventures together, of which there will be dangerous ones.

Premise The Mushroom Kingdom is being invaded by a horde of viruses of various colors. To save the Kingdom, Mario, Princess Peach, and Bowser must don lab coats and defeat the viruses by destroying them with capsules of the same color as the viruses. Along the way, they are joined by other characters from the Mario franchise‚Äîincluding Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, Toadette, Bowser Jr., Ludwig von Koopa, Wendy O. Koopa, Waluigi, Wario, Princess Daisy, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Rosalina, Luma, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Baby Rosalina, Kamek, Dry Bowser, Larry Koopa, Roy Koopa, Nabbit, Goomba Tower, Lakitu, Koopa Troopa, Dolphin, Baby Wario, 8-Bit Dr. Mario, and Lemmy Koopa ‚Äîas they complete puzzles spanning multiple worlds across the Kingdom. Gameplay In Dr. Mario World, and similar to prior Dr. Mario games, the player removes viruses from the screen by matching their colors with that of a pill capsule. The player orients a single pill capsule against an array of viruses and obstacles. As the pill begins to drift upwards, the player can rotate and horizontally move the pill such that, when settled, the pill's color will match at least two similarly colored viruses in a vertical or horizontal direction. The level is complete when all viruses are removed. The player is able to float multiple pills at once and even drag pills through obstacles to specific positions as long as the pill feasibly fits. Later levels add additional elements, such as shielded viruses and destructible blocks to complicate the removal of viruses. Other levels have additional requirements for completion, such as extracting hidden coins from blocks. Upon filling a \\"skill meter\\", the player can activate a special ability once or twice in each level. Different special abilities are associated with the game's playable characters. For example, Dr. Mario can remove the entire bottom row on the game screen, Dr. Yoshi removes three on-screen items at random, and Dr. Peach can remove a full column. The player can also purchase power-ups through real-money microtransactions to instantaneously fill the skill meter. At the time of launch, ten playable characters are available, with Dr. Mario as the default character. Following the completion of the first five stages, the player may choose to continue using Dr. Mario, or they may elect to switch to either Dr. Peach or Dr. Bowser. Players are also given the option to enlist \\"assistants\\" that provide the player with benefits during gameplay; for example, Pokey grants the player a 10% chance of earning an additional 3 seconds in timed stages, and Koopa Troopa grants 50 bonus points for each remaining capsule at the conclusion of a stage. Additional doctors and assistants are acquired at random using either coins accumulated during gameplay or diamonds purchased with real-world currency. Similar to other mobile match-three games, such as Candy Crush, the game is monetized through timers, currencies, and purchasable digital items. For example, the player uses \\"hearts\\" to play a level, which replenish over time. The player can use coins and diamonds to purchase new characters/abilities, power-ups, and bonus pill capsules. The player receives coins for completing daily activities. Diamonds packs are purchased in exchange for real-world money through the app store. The game has a simple single-player campaign and a \\"versus\\" multiplayer mode. Dr. Mario World requires a constant Internet connection. Development The game was released for Android and iOS mobile platforms in 59 territories on July 9, 2019. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Polygon reported not feeling forced to spend real money through the game's monetization mechanics. Within the first three days of the game's launch, Dr. Mario World had over two million downloads and 100,000 spent.https://sensortower.com/blog/dr-mario-world- first-72-hours Notes References Further reading  External links * Category:2019 video games Category:Nintendo games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Match 3 games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in South Korea Category:Nintendo Entertainment Planning & Development games Category:Mario puzzle games Category:Dr. Mario games ","title":"Dr. Mario World"},{"id":"61241532","text":"Al-Shafuniyah () also spelled Al-Shifuniyah and Shafuniyeh, is a Syrian village located in Markaz Rif Dimashq, Douma District .

Fastran models accelerations and retardation and other variable amplitude loading effects in crack growth using a crack closure model. The program uses a strip yield model of the crack tip that was first proposed by D. S. Dugdale to calculate the size of the plastic zone ahead of a crack tip. A series of elastic-perfectly plastic strips (originally 30 strips were used) that model the region both ahead and behind the crack tip is used to keep track of the plasticity produced at the crack tip. As the crack grows, the strips are cut and leave a region of raised plastic material in the crack wake that prevents the complete closure of a crack. This profile of the crack is used to calculate the stress intensity factor level K_\\\\text{op} at which the crack tip is fully open. The effective stress intensity factor range is then : \\\\Delta K_\\\\text{eff} = K_\\\\text{max} - \\\\text{max}(K_\\\\text{op}, K_\\\\text{min}) which allows the rate of growth for the loading cycle to be obtained from the crack growth equation. The rate of crack growth is then calculated from : {da \\\\over dN} = f(\\\\Delta K_\\\\text{eff})  History  Fastran was written in the 1980's by James C. Newman while at NASA and is an acronym derived from NASA FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS. Crack closure was first observed by Wolf Elber as propping open a crack tip resulting in a reduction of the full stress intensity range or crack tip driving force. It was assumed this was due to plasticity at the crack tip preventing the fracture surfaces from fully closing. A similar program CORPUS was also developed around the same time by A. U. de Koning. FASTRAN is written in the Fortran programming language.  Features  = Geometry factors = The geometry factor \\\\beta relates the far-field stresses to the region near the crack tip. Many standard geometry factors are supplied in the program. These scaling factors allow the calculation of the stress intensity factor from the applied loading sequence using : K = \\\\beta \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi a} where \\\\sigma is the applied far field stress and a is the crack length. The loading sequence is given as a file of sequential turning points that represent the loading sequence. This in combination with a load factor is used to supply the far-field stress of the given geometry. The load sequence is converted into a series of individual load cycles by a method known as rainflow on the fly which is a modified form of the standard rainflow-counting algorithm. The closure model has also been used to explain the increase rate of growth seen with small cracks known as the small crack effect. = Crack growth equations = Fastran has a variety of crack growth equations built in along with piece wise linear equations that can be read from file.  Theory  This model allows the calculation of the stress ratio R or mean stress effect that gives rise to the increased rate of crack growth at higher stress ratios. Experiments have shown the crack is typically open at R>0.7. In addition the model is able to predict retardation due to overloads which increase the plastic material in the wake of the crack. It also explains the acceleration due to underloads where the crack growth rate increases following an underload which compresses the crack faces together and reduced the degree of interference lowering K_\\\\text{op}. The onset of plasticity is given by the flow stress whose value typically lies mid-way between the yield and ultimate stresses. The flow stress scaling parameter \\\\alpha is used to adjust the flow stress to the degree of restraint experienced at the crack tip. This value reflects the stress state at the crack tip and typically lies between a value of \\\\pi for plane stress and 2\\\\pi for plane strain. The parameter is also used as an adjustment variable to correct the rate of crack to match test data.  Limitations  Plasticity will be greater in regions of plane stress but Fastran only models the crack as a 2d cross section.  Usage  Fastran has been used in the research community and for maintaining the safe life of aircraft as the C-130 used by the USAF, RAF and RAAF.

The story is set in a Christmas-time Saint Petersburg, the Russian Empire at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, among ice-covered rivers and canals of the capital seethe with festive activities. Matvey is a young man from a poor lamplighter, fate brings two people together on the holiday streets to be the silver skates, who once met an aristocrat girl named Alisa is an intellectual from a noble family. Since then, the heroes together follow their dreams, based on the novel of the same name. The main roles will be played by the pairs Fedor Fedotov and Sofya Priss, the film also starred Aleksei Guskov, Yuri Kolokolnikov, Severija Janusauskaite, Kirill Zaytsev and Yuri Borisov. Principal photography lasted from February winter to May spring 2019, and took place in Saint Petersburg, in the palaces of the Grand prince, taking place at Sadovaya Street in the Saint Michael's Castle, as well as on the frozen rivers and canals of the Northern Capital, in the town of Kronstadt, Gatchina and Vsevolozhsk of the Leningrad Oblast, Russia.  Plot  The film takes place in 1899 in St. Petersburg, where absolutely different people meet: the father and son of an ordinary lamplighter, Matvey, who has silver skates, and a daughter of a dignitary named Alisa, who is fond of the world of science. They will help each other realize their dreams...  Cast  * Fedor Fedotov as Matvey (English: Matthew) * Sofya Priss as Alisa (English: Alice) * Aleksei Guskov as Nikolay Nikolaevich (English: Nikolai Nikolaevitch) * Yuri Kolokolnikov as Grand prince * Severija Janusauskaite as Severina * as Prince Arkadiy Trubetskoy * as Aleks (English: Alex) * as Margo (English: Margot) * Timofey Tribuntsev as Pyotr (English: Petr) * Sergey Koltakov as Dmitri Mendeleev * Denis Lavant as Fourier * Cathy Belton as Miss Jackson * Vasiliy Kopeikin as Mukha (English: Muha) * Mikhail Shelomentsev as Graf * Bato Shoinjonov as the Yakut guy Chingiz * Yan Reshetnikov as a footman Production The director of the picture was the debutant of the full meter Michael Lockshin, a famous clip maker and director of advertising. =Casting= The main roles in the film are debutants - actors Fedor Fedotov and Sofya \\"Sonia\\" Priss from St. Petersburg. The company on the screen are the masters and actor of the star: Aleksei Guskov, Yuri Kolokolnikov, Severija Janusauskaite, Kirill Zaytsev, Yuriy Borisov, Aleksandra Revenko, Timofey Tribuntsev, Sergey Koltakov, and also stars of European cinema Denis Lavant and Cathy Belton. All the actors who had to skate for the role underwent serious training. Fedor Fedotov was a little more fortunate than his colleagues: he had been playing hockey from the age of three, but for the film the actor had to master a completely different, non-hockey, skating style, which took three months of intensive training. Almost all the stunts in the film were performed by Fedor himself. =Filming= Fountain House in classicism style on the Fontanka Embankment as a filming location for Alisa's family house. The shooting location for the film set began on February 4, 2019, a snowy day in the Leningrad Oblast. Most of the filming took place on the frozen rivers of the Moyka, Kryukov Canal and Griboyedov Canal in St. Petersburg, in which the cinema has never been filmed in such a volume in the entire history! The film crew built and decorated ice fairs and skating rinks, and when spring began to come into its own, a large-scale decoration of the frozen Moyka River was built in the pavilion to shoot action scenes on ice. = Post-production = The computer graphics for the project will be handled by Alexander Gorokhov's CGF visual effects studio. The volume of graphics will be impressive, because the events of the film unfold at the turn of the century, on the eve of 1900, in winter New Year's Eve in St. Petersburg. Release After being postponed by six months, The Silver Skates premiered on the opening night of the 42nd Moscow International Film Festival. The film is scheduled to receive a wide screen release in December 2020.

Introduced and featured most prominently on The Flash, the character is based on the DC Comics villain of the same name and is portrayed by actors Tom Cavanagh and Matt Letscher. Letscher plays Thawne's original likeness, while Cavanagh portrays the character in the form of Harrison Wells. Both actors' performance have been praised by critics and fans.  Storylines  = The Flash = In season one, Harrison Wells is introduced as the director of S.T.A.R. Labs, Central City on Earth-1. He activates a particle accelerator which explodes, allowing dark matter energy released to transform various people, including Barry Allen, into metahumans. Months later, Wells has become a recluse and a pariah of Central City while he and his assistants Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow help Barry as the Flash; Wells pushes Barry to run faster to increase abilities as a speedster by taking down metahuman criminals. Unknown to the rest of the team, Wells is faking paralysis and has a hidden futuristic time vault within S.T.A.R. Labs, from which he conducts surveillance on his co-workers. He demonstrates a desire to keep Barry safe from harm, and murders Simon Stagg for seeking to exploit the Flash's powers. He ultimately appears as a tachyon-enhanced speedster who is dubbed the \\"Reverse-Flash\\", and bests Barry in combat. \\"Wells\\" is later revealed to be Eobard Thawne, the Flash's archenemy from the 22nd century and a descendant of police officer Eddie Thawne. Traveling to the 21st century to erase the Flash from history by murdering Nora Allen and framing Henry Allen, Thawne is left stranded with his Speed Force connection severed so he killed the real Wells and assumed his identity. As Wells, he then founded S.T.A.R. Labs and created the particle accelerator to turn Barry into the Flash, hoping to use Barry's pure Speed Force connection to return home. After being exposed and later captured by Barry with help from Oliver Queen, Ronnie Raymond and Martin Stein, Thawne offers Barry a chance to travel back in time to save the Allen family in exchange for a time machine to return to the 22nd century. Barry ultimately refuses and destroys Thawne's machine. The two speedsters then fight, with Thawne prevailing until Eddie shoots himself, seemingly erasing Thawne from existence. In subsequent seasons, Thawne makes sporadic appearances. In season two, a flash drive containing Thawne's will as Wells bequeathes S.T.A.R. Labs to Barry and a video-recorded confession to Nora's murder which allowed for Henry's exoneration. Barry later travels back in time to season one's timeframe to obtain Thawne's help with tachyon equipment. In season three, Barry saves Nora from Thawne's true form who is locked up in a prison. After the Flashpoint timeline's dangers, Barry realizes the mistake and releases Thawne to kill Nora again hoping the timeline will revert to normal. In season four, Thawne is revealed to clearly know of and admired Clifford DeVoe. In season five, Thawne ‚Äì still with the appearance of Wells ‚Äì is revealed to be the secret mentor of Nora West-Allen, Barry's and Iris West-Allen's future daughter. Imprisoned in Iron Heights in 2049 under a death sentence and routinely tortured by a corrupt prison guard, he professes to Nora that he helps to ensure a better legacy for himself than simply being known only as an evil speedster. Nora first approached Thawne for his help in capturing Godspeed after Nora's own speed powers are discovered, and believed him to be the only person to be trust after learning that Iris deliberately suppressed Nora's powers. Thawne agreed to train Nora in the use of speed, revealing Barry's identity. It was Thawne's suggestion that Nora help Barry with DeVoe's crashing satellite, and the pair routinely keep in touch through Nora's journal. Barry ultimately returns Nora to 2049 after learning of Nora's connection with Thawne and goes to confront Thawne personally. Thawne asks Barry not to hold the secrecy against Nora as a condemned man's final request. Thawne later reveals to Nora the existence of a negative Speed Force, one that allows time travel without alerting other speedsters, which Nora is unable to access until being enraged by the assumption of no longer being loved by Barry much to Thawne's consternation. Witnessing Thawne's interaction with Nora, Iris relates to Barry that Thawne, although clearly manipulating Nora, also displays an almost paternal concern and seems to genuinely care. However, it is later revealed that Thawne's powers were negated by Cicada's dagger, and that the whole reason he mentored Nora for traveling to the past was to destroy the dagger and free himself. After the dagger is destroyed, Thawne is freed moments before his execution. He briefly fights Nora and Barry before Team Flash gets distracted when Nora began to be erased from existence. After the two ran away to enter the Negative Speed Force at Thawne's fervent suggestion, Thawne makes his escape. In the sixth season, Thawne is turned into a being of negative tachyons fused with Nash Wells following the Crisis. Over the course of several months, Thawne is able to assert control. However, as he had yet to regain his speed, Team Flash catches and imprisons him at S.T.A.R. Labs. After he slowly regains his connection to the Negative Speed Force, Team Flash builds a device to \\"exorcise\\" him. Despite his best efforts, Thawne is defeated once more and expelled from Nash's body. As an energy being however, he is not killed; only left without a body to possess. = Legends of Tomorrow = After escaping the Flashpoint timeline, Thawne's true form appears on season two traveling through time. Due to his own nullified state of existence being an aberration, he was hunted by the Black Flash, forcing him to seek out the Spear of Destiny in order to restore his natural existence. Unable to find the object and outrun the enforcer at the same time, Thawne formed a supervillain alliance, intending for his 'allies' to help him search for various items that will lead him to the Spear when he can't remain in one point in time without being caught by the Black Flash. Thawne and his co-conspirators eventually retrieve the Spear of Destiny, which they use to rewrite reality to their whims. Despite initially succeeding, his plan was foiled by the Legends travelling back in time and de-powering the object, causing Thawne to be vaporized by the Black Flash, being restored to the timeline and his original events as Wells. = Crossovers =  Crisis On Earth-X  During the crossover, Thawne is revealed to be an ally of the Nazi-dominated Earth-X leaders Dark Arrow and Overgirl. Claiming to have resumed the appearance of Wells \\"for old times' sake\\", Thawne implies to Barry that he survived his erasure from existence due to time travel vagaries. He assists Dark Arrow in saving Overgirl's life, along with their intent to invade Earth-1. During the final battle, Barry defeats Thawne but spares his life, and Thawne departs while his allies are killed.  Elseworlds  During the second part of the crossover, Barry and Oliver are hit with hallucination gas in which the two fight each other; at this time, Oliver sees the face of Thawne and Barry sees the face of Malcolm Merlyn.  Concept and creation  On February 10, 2014, Tom Cavanagh was set to join The Flash as Harrison Wells. The producers of the show said the following about the character: 'There's obviously more that meets the eye when you see Harrison Wells. ... His motivations are a big mystery, and tracking that through has been a very interesting ride with Mr. Cavanagh.' In episode 15 of the series, Cavanagh was revealed to playing Eobard Thawne. The writers did not want to call him Eobard Thawne from the pilot because, according to co-creator Andrew Kreisberg, 'it's not like a movie where you watch it and the story is over. It's a TV show where after every week you can research the name Eobard Thawne and you can tell where the story is going. That's why we didn't go that path.' Two episodes later featured the debut of Matt Letscher in the role, which shocked viewers. The executive producers had not planned this twist from the start, with Kreisberg saying, 'We were talking about, 'well what if Wells wasn't Wells? What if he stole Wells' body?' While Cavanagh would continue playing Thawne on The Flash, Letscher subsequently went on to portray a time- displaced version of the character in season two of Legends of Tomorrow.  Character development  = Characterization = Cavanagh has stated many times that he enjoys playing the character of Eobard Thawne as the character is interesting, complex and challenging to portray. When speaking with the Television Academy he had this to say about playing Thawne: 'The Reverse Flash has what I like to a call timeless way of speaking. He doesn't use colloquialisms from 2016, he's a little more formal, and he takes joy in destroying people. He has a larger perspective because he comes from 100-plus years in the future and has seen it all. It's easy to play a character like that. He's the arch in arch-villain.' He also sat down with Rolling Stone to discuss his supervillain voice in which he said: \\"If you're doing it right, you can be charismatic, you can win people over, and you can have so much fun. You build a cage and then you just rattle that cage more than the leading guy can a lot.\\" Kreisberg insisted that Thawne was not evil because his fatherly affection for Cisco was genuine, and \\"he has a reason for doing what he's doing and he has an agenda and he thinks of himself as the hero ... bad people are capable of incredible amounts of kindness and generosity\\". = Costume = When asked by the Television Academy about wearing the Reverse-Flash suit, Cavanagh replied with \\"That‚Äôs a lot of what acting is. Often times, you‚Äôre tapping into the things you did as a youth. You pretended. A lot of us pretended to be Batman, to be our favorite super-hero. A lot of times, you pretended to have the power of imagination at your side. And the first time you put it on, the cameras are rolling, and off you go at superspeed. I‚Äôve gotten to do some great, great thrilling stunts in the suit. It is a dream come true. I understand that it‚Äôs a job, and I‚Äôm getting paid, but the second that a director yells, ‚ÄúAction‚Äù, all that disappears, and you're a guy in a supersuit. It's extremely thrilling. I‚Äôve said before that I wish that anyone who is a legitimate comic book fan could have this opportunity. It really feels like a privilege.\\" Cavanagh also said \\"I benefited from all the trial and error that went into that. ‚Ä¶ I think they did a marvelous job with the suit, I‚Äôm always very flattered and honored to put it on,\\" when speaking with Access Hollywood.  Reception  = Critical response = The critical response to Cavanagh's version of the character has been sky-high since his debut. The American business magazine Forbes praised Cavanagh for his role in The Flash season 1 with Erik Kain stating \\"Tom Cavanagh is uncanny, a perfect fit for the ominous yet likable villain.

It will be located on the LIRR Main Line. It is being developed as part of the redevelopment of Belmont Park, which includes the new UBS Arena for the New York Islanders.  History  Plans for the station were first announced in July 2019 by New York governor Andrew Cuomo. New York Arena Partners, the main party behind the Belmont Park redevelopment, will pay $97 million of the estimated $105 million cost, with the balance being paid by the state. The eastbound platform will open first, in 2021, followed by the westbound platform in late 2022. When completed, it would be the first completely new LIRR station since 1976, when the now-dismantled Southampton Campus station opened. It would be served by Hempstead Branch trains at all times. The project is seen as vital to the Belmont Park redevelopment. Though the Elmont station will serve a portion of Elmont that does not currently have full-time train service, opponents of UBS Arena have claimed that the station plans conceal the real motivation behind building the arena. The LIRR anticipates that the new Elmont station would not be expected to generate new commuter ridership but would instead result in a shift of existing riders living in Bellerose Terrace and Elmont that currently use other stations. With the operation of the Elmont station, existing levels of commuter service would be maintained to other LIRR stations (e.g., Queens Village, Bellerose, Floral Park) and the addition of the Elmont station would not be anticipated to result in an impact to commuter service. Station layout (planned) This station will have two 12-car-long side platforms, both of which will be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Unlike the Belmont Park station directly to the south, it will be able to serve Main Line trains from both the west and east. The station will also include platform canopies, LED signs, benches, USB charging ports, bike racks, and art. Parking will be available at an existing 2,860-space parking lot, with 150 spaces specifically for commuters. Outside the station, an electric shuttle bus service will take passengers to the Belmont Park development. The station would be located directly east of the overpass across the Cross Island Parkway. The location of the station will give platform access on the Bellerose Terrace side via an overpass. Though designated the Elmont Station, the location of the proposed station is to the nearest residence in Elmont. All residents of the Nassau County portion of Bellerose, many in the Queens portion of Bellerose and many Floral Park residents will live closer to this station than anyone in Elmont. The main entrance and dedicated parking for commuters is on the existing Belmont Park property in the northwestern corner of Elmont. Direct road access to the commuter lot will be via the Cross Island Parkway entrance and exit to and from the Belmont Park property.

Wi-Fi for subway passengers is a standard service provided in the majority of large cities worldwide such as Hong-Kong, London, New York, St. Petersburg, Singapore, Tokyo, and Toronto. Delivering high-speed Wi-Fi on underground trains is more complex and requires two radio networks: one which delivers the signal to tunnels and trains (a Trackside Network or TSN), and a Wi-Fi network on board the trains to enable passenger connectivity. Wi-Fi connectivity currently operates on underground trains in Moscow and St. Petersburg (Russia)., Seoul (Korea), Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Shanghai (China). The first known subway system to install onboard Wi-Fi was the Seoul Metro in 2009. The trackside network was based on WiMAX or WiBro (IEEE 802.16m). Trains were connected to the TSN at a speed of about 30Mbit/s and the Wi-Fi service was provided only to Korean Telecom (KT) subscribers over a private Wi-Fi network. Later, in 2017, it was announced that the network would be renovated to deliver high-speed Wi-Fi to the general public. High-speed free public onboard Wi-Fi was first introduced by MaximaTelecom in the Moscow Metro in 2013. By the end of 2014, all 12 metro lines were equipped with a 5 GHz TSN delivering up to 150Mbit/s per train with an average of 80Mbit/s. The last known deployment was in Guangzhou in 2018, which reportedly features over 400Mbit/s speed per train. The fastest onboard network in the world was built in the St. Petersburg metro. It features up to 500Mbit/s speed per train and was built by MaximaTelecom at the end of 2017. Available technologies Wi-Fi on subway trains is typically based on cellular (WiMAX, 3G or LTE) radio networks or private trackside networks in the 5 GHz band. Among these two alternatives, LTE and 5 GHz TSN are the only technologies used in contemporary installations. There are no reported cases of implementing LTE coverage specifically to deliver passenger Wi-Fi, since LTE itself is sufficient to enable passenger connectivity on moving trains. LTE coverage with leaking cable antennas is also far more expensive than a TSN, costing $100K-500K per km of track (in systems with separated tracks for two directions) compared with $50K-100K per km of track for a TSN, based on reported investments in these networks worldwide. Therefore, public Wi-Fi on trains can be delivered using existing LTE coverage in tunnels or separately deployed private TSN's. To deliver onboard Wi-Fi, in addition to ensuring radio coverage in tunnels, the operator has to equip the head cars with radio devices to capture the signal from the tunnels, to install Wi-Fi access points in all train cars and to deploy a wired local-area network (LAN) on board. =LTE-based Wi-Fi= For LTE-based Wi-Fi, LTE routers are commonly installed on both head cars (actually, the head car and the end car). In order to deliver high-speed Wi- Fi, LTE routers must ensure the LTE aggregation functionality, which bonds two or more LTE data channels into one logical channel having a stable (without dead spots) and robust connection up to 150Mbit/s in off-peak hours. The main issue here is that LTE networks share their throughput between trains and passengers using LTE on board. During rush hours, LTE networks can be overloaded leading the Wi-Fi service to become unavailable. At least, the throughput can't be guaranteed. The main advantage of LTE-based Wi-Fi is the relatively low investment required ‚Äì only the trains need to be equipped. Another benefit ‚Äì the train operator can introduce the service without any involvement by the subway operator if they are different companies. But this can be the case only if multi-operator LTE coverage is already in place. LTE- aggregation routers and integrated user experience solutions are offered by multiple companies including leaders such as iComera, Nomad Digital, Klass Telecom and Passengera. =TSN-based Wi-Fi= TSN-based Wi-Fi is the only reasonable method for guaranteeing reliable, high-speed connectivity for passengers. The TSN itself can be used for multiple applications from passenger connectivity to IoT applications and Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). To configure a TSN, a core packet network must be installed across the track. TSN base stations usually operate in unlicensed 5GHz Wi-Fi bands, though other similar bands can be used depending on local regulations. The base stations are installed 250-900m apart and are connected to the core network through fiber or RJ45 ports. Since the leading solutions by FluidMesh and RADWIN are based on Wi-Fi chipsets, the supported features are relatively similar. However, both use specific proprietary management algorithms to ensure stable hand-over and to increase the average throughput. To enable connectivity on trains, mobile units or base stations generally should be installed in each head/end car. Since the operating frequency is high, the best way to ensure performance is to install ‚Äòshark‚Äô antennas on top of train cars. Another way is to install flat panel antennas inside the cabin, though contemporary trains usually have metalized glass windows which prevent a 5 GHz signal from passing through at a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Leading 5 GHz TSN solutions are based on IEEE 802.11ac (WiFi 5) chips and feature more than 800 Mbit/s peak aggregated UL+DL physical throughput with two spatial streams. However, real life throughput is much lower. Achieving actual L2/L3 800 Mbit/s peak throughput in tunnels is only possible with 3 or 4 spatial streams. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to effectively utilize more than two independent streams in subway environment due to physical constraints of radio signal propagation in tunnels. Investment and monetization models for TSN Since LTE-based Wi-Fi is usually a supplemental service provided by a transport operator or a cellular carrier, the common funding model here is direct investment without any monetization. TSN provides more opportunities for monetization ‚Äì from passenger Wi-Fi with dramatically better performance than existing LTE networks to IoT services with guaranteed performance for transport operators (CCTV with online access, TV broadcasting, telemetry, CBTC, infotainment, etc.). Therefore, there are cases where private external investments were made into TSN-based passenger Wi-Fi projects such as the Moscow and St. Petersburg metros by Maxima References Category:Wi-Fi Category:Underground rapid transit systems ","title":"Passenger Wi-Fi on subway trains"},{"id":"61241993","text":"Mission () is a 1961 Soviet drama film directed by Yuri Yegorov.–ù–∞–∑–≤–∞–Ω—ã –≤—Ä–µ–º—è –∏ –º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –æ—Ç–ø–µ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–æ–Ω –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥–∏—è –§—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞–°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫ ¬´–°–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞¬ª. –ö–∞–∫–∏–º –º—ã –∑–∞–ø–æ–º–Ω–∏–ª–∏ –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥–∏—è –§—Ä–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞  Plot  The film tells about the engineer-designer of agricultural machinery, who suddenly finds out that the tractor that he invented does not work, and he goes to help the collective farmers.–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞  Cast  * Oleg Efremov–ú–û–°–ö–í–ò–ß–ê–ú –ü–û–ö–ê–ñ–£–¢ –§–ò–õ–¨–ú–´ –° –û–õ–ï–ì–û–ú –ï–§–†–ï–ú–û–í–´–ú * Dodo Abashidze * Svetlana Karpinskaya * Valeri Malyshev * Gennadi Frolov * Olga Lysenko * Aleksey Mironov * Ivan Lapikov * Mariya Andrianova * Yevgeny Vesnik * Emmanuil Geller–ö–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞ (1961) Full Cast & Crew  References   External links  * Category:1961 films Category:Russian-language films Category:Soviet films ","title":"Mission (film)"},{"id":"61242000","text":"Bogue Culley is a stream in the U.S. state of Mississippi.

The vessel was launched as Vesterlide but was renamed early in 1917 after the Cunard Line bought the vessel from their Norwegian owners. The freighter was torpedoed and sunk in January 1918 with a loss of two men. Design and construction In late 1915 Lauritz Kloster of Stavanger, who at the time was operating four small vessels in the Baltic, decided to expand their operations into trans-Atlantic trade. In February 1916 a contract was prepared between the Norwegian firm, A/S Klosters Rederi, on one side and Northwest Steel Co. and Willamette Iron & Steel Works on the other, to build two vessels of approximately 8,800 deadweight, and signed in early April of the same year. Vesterlide was laid down on 27 July 1916 at the Northwest Steel newly built shipyard on the south side of Portland, and launched on 31 March 1917 (yard number 1), with Miss Marion Virginia Bowles, daughter of J. R. Bowles, the president of Northwest Steel Co., being the sponsor. As the ship was the first steel freighter to be built in Portland, the launching ceremony was open to the public, and was attended by a large number of common folk as well as local dignitaries. As Vesterlide was launched, two hawsers holding her bow failed and the freighter lunged into water travelling approximately half a mile across the Willamette River and smashing into sternwheeler hitting her amidships and opening a wide hole in her. Three people on board the wheeler were injured as they jumped over board. Ruth sank after approximately 45 minutes, but was later raised, repaired and returned to service. The ship was a two-deck three-island steamer with machinery amidships, and was equipped with all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from four main and one small hatches. The vessel also had electrical lights installed along the decks. While the vessels were still under construction, A/S Klosters Rederi made a decision to divest of two of them due to delays in delivery and uncertainties related to ongoing World War I. As British were attempting to replenish huge losses suffered by their Merchant marine during the course of the war, the Norwegians were eventually approached by the Cunard Line. On 26 February 1917 Vesterlide and her sister ship Vesterlen, also being built by Northwest Steel, were sold for approximately 4,300,000. On 10 April 1917 it was announced that all new Cunard vessel names would be prefixed by the word \\"War\\" and Vesterlide was officially rechristened War Baron. Initially, the freighter was slated to leave for her trials on 5 July but due to the need to erect a gun platform her departure was delayed until 9 July, when War Baron left the shipyard for Tacoma. After successful completion of sea trials War Baron returned to Tacoma to load cargo and was handed over to the Cunard Line officials on July 14. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . War Baron was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 8,800. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single Curtis turbine rated at 508 nhp, double- reduction geared to a single screw propeller that moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel. Operational history While still under construction the vessel was inspected by the 13th Naval District on 29 June 1917 and assigned the Navy ID # 1641. She was not taken over for U.S. Navy service and remained under British control until the end of her career. Following delivery to Cunard Line the ship loaded cargo of lumber and general merchandise at various ports of the Pacific Northwest and departed Port Townsend on 3 August 1917 to Esquimalt. There she was to receive her sealed orders, which her captain had to open when the vessel was past Cape Flattery. She eventually arrived in England at the end of October 1917 via San Pedro and the Panama Canal. Upon arrival in England War Baron was taken over by the Shipping Controller with intention of being used to transport ammunition and provisions and was armed. The vessel remained in Southampton until early January 1918. On 5 January 1918 War Baron was on a passage from Southampton to Barry for coaling. At approximately 16:45 local time while about northeast of the Godrevy Lighthouse, she was suddenly struck amidships by a torpedo launched by German submarine . An explosion ripped a huge hole in the steamer's hull, and she began quickly to fill up. Lifeboats were launched and all but two seamen aboard the freighter were able to abandon the sinking ship either in lifeboats or by jumping overboard. As the attack took place so close to the shore, the whole incident was witnessed and wireless call for help was immediately dispatched. Several Navy vessels arrived a couple of hours later and all survivors were soon safely landed ashore.

He was a member of the New Haven County Medical Association.Yale Alumni Weekly, 1911. In 1923, The New International Encyclopedia's entry for vegetarianism noted that \\"Buttner described a vegetarian as one who does not habitually make use of flesh food, in contradistinction to the habitual meat eater.\\"The New International Encyclopedia, Volume 23.

A Fleshless Diet. A List of Books and References to Periodicals in the Seattle Public Library. p. 18 Buttner wrote that \\"It is not illogical for vegetarians to use milk and eggs, as these animal products are distinctly less toxic than meat and also less likely to be disease-laden. They are obtained with a minimum of suffering on the part of the animals which furnish them to us.\\"Buttner, J. L. (1912). Vegetarianism. Journal of the American Medical Association 58 (22): 1705. A review in the American Physical Education Review, praised the book for compiling useful dietetic research but commented that it failed to show scientific discretion in the selected material. A review in the Journal of the American Medical Association recommended the book as a reference work whether or not one accepts Buttner's conclusions. A review in the Medical Standard, noted that the book was a \\"piece of special pleading for the propaganda which it is designed to promote [‚Ä¶] We may say this, however, for Dr. Buttner, that he has managed to present a much more rational and scientific case in behalf of a vegetable diet than most of those who have heretofore made the attempt.\\" A negative review of the book in The Medical Era suggested that \\"Dr Buttner has correlated the usual arguments in favor of a vegetable diet, but has failed to show any scientific basis for the conclusions which he draws.\\"Anonymous.

A review in the Yale Medical Journal concluded that \\"we do not agree that the total abstinence from flesh foods will produce the beneficial results that he maintains.\\" It was positively reviewed in the Life and Health magazine as \\"so carefully written that it is worthy of consideration.\\" The American Journal of Clinical Medicine also positively reviewed the book as a \\"very reasonable and believable argument against the use of meat.\\" Selected publications *A Fleshless Diet: Vegetarianism as a Rational Dietary (New York, 1910) *An Author's Defence of His Book on Vegetarianism (Yale Alumni Weekly, 1910) *Vegetarianism (New York Medical Journal, 1911) *Vegetarianism (Journal of the American Medical Association, 1912) *Correspondence: Early Man and Meat Diet (Journal of the American Medical Association, 1916) See also *Ovo-lacto vegetarianism References Category:1876 births Category:20th-century American physicians Category:American food writers Category:American health and wellness writers Category:American nutritionists Category:Vegetarianism activists Category:Yale School of Medicine alumni Category:Year of death missing ","title":"J.

The Fraternal Brotherhood was one of the many fraternal and mutual aid organizations that arose in the United States during the golden age of fraternalism. Unlike most such societies in that era, it accepted men and women as members on an equal footing. In March 1914, Emma R. Neidig was elected as its Supreme President, the first woman to head such a mixed-gender fraternal organization. Neidig had been Supreme Vice President of the organization since 1898, two years after its founding in 1896 in Los Angeles, California. The group was largely a mutual insurance society, described by the Los Angeles Herald in 1908 as \\"one of the most popular and trustworthy orders in the country\\" with \\"about 40,000 members\\" and with offices on Figueroa Street at the corner of Lincoln in Los Angeles. Still, during its years as the Fraternal Brotherhood, it had many of the trappings of a lodge or secret society. There were 23,720 benefit members and 711 social members in 280 lodges in 1923. Each lodge had a chaplain. There was also a juvenile department for children of members. The Brotherhood had a secret ritual, passwords, grips and signs.Preuss, Arthur A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies St. Louis, B. Herder Book Co. 1924, p.129. Although they were active in fourteen U.S. states in 1908 and eighteen in 1923, the bulk of their business was in California. According to the California Insurance Commissioner, in 1924 the organization had assets of $1,304,372.10 and paid $459,411.90 in benefits, the bulk of that being death claims ($204,938.05) and old age benefits ($189,315.40), but also including $27,194.46 in permanent disability claims and $33,595.90 in sick and accident claims (the remaining $4,368.09 being certificate and reissue fees). The organization merged with the Iowa-based Homesteaders Life Association in 1931, becoming the Golden West Life Insurance Association. In 1948 it was renamed as the Homesteader‚Äôs Life Company. Homesteaders Life Association had similar origins as a fraternal and mutual insurance organization, the Homesteaders, also admitting men and women on an equal footing. Founded in 1906 by two officers who were forced to resign from the Brotherhood of American Yeomen, in 1923 it had transformed from a fraternal organization to just a mutual insurance group.

History The group was established on 20 February 2013 by Ahrar al-Sham with local fighters from Raqqa to help keep a local image and legitimize the rebel offensive with locals in the Raqqa governorate against the Syrian government, which composed of many outsiders from the region, prior to the battle to take the city from the government and its allies. The group was also established with the purpose to act as Ahrar al-Sham's law enforcement in the city, and to help implement Islamic law and to administer areas taken from the government. On 5 March 2013, the group assumed responsibility for Raqqa, and helped in forming ties between other allied armed factions and the locals of the city. On 19 April 2013, Liwa Umana al-Raqqa published a video of the group distributing food and aid to locals.https://web.archive.org/watch?v=zFdt8_qjf-M During the group's presence in Raqqa they enforced Sharia and cooperated with Sharia courts in Raqqa and brought offenders to these courts to be penalized and prosecuted. One offender was reportedly beaten by members on the group on order from a Sharia court the group was working with. The group‚Äôs commander detailed that the group worked closely with Jabhat al-Nusra and held an alliance with them. The group later came into conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant along with other rebel groups based in Raqqa, including the Jihad in the Path of God Brigade, and Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, eventually coming together in an alliance with the armed branch of the Kurdish PYD party, the People's Protection Units (YPG).

It is the 7th highest peak of the Okanogan Range, which is a sub-range of the North Cascades.Okanogan Range Peakbagger.com The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Lago, to the east, and Osceola Peak stands west. The mountain has a steep north face, but the south slope is covered in scree which allows a nontechnical climbing ascent. Precipitation runoff from Mount Carru drains north into Lease Creek which is a tributary of the Pasayten River, or south into Eureka Creek, which is part of the Methow River drainage basin. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology Carru, north aspect The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is native to east Brazil, where it grows in a variety of habitats, including moist forest, dunes and coastal rocks. Description Hatiora cylindrica is closely related to Hatiora salicornioides, and has been included within that species. Like H. salicornioides, it is a leafless perennial with many branched green stems made up of individual segments. These are strictly cylindrical as opposed to bottle-shaped in H. salicornioides. Its flowers, borne at the end of the stems, have many yellow to orange petals and open quite widely. They are followed by white fruits. Taxonomy Hatiora cylindrica was first described by Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Rose in 1923. It has not always been viewed as a separate species, being included in H. salicornioides as either the form or the variety cylindrica. Molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed its placement in the genus and in the tribe Rhipsalideae, and also shown that it is closely related to H. salicornioides (which may include some other distinct species). Distribution and habitat Hatiora cylindrica is native to Bahia in Northeast Brazil, and Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro in Southeast Brazil. It may also be present in Esp√≠rito Santo, also in Southeast Brazil. It is found from sea level to elevations of . It grows as an epiphyte, in the ground and probably as a lithophyte in a variety of habitats, including humid forests, sand dunes and coastal rocks. Conservation When assessed in 2010, it was considered to be endangered. It occurred in five localities, only one of which was protected. The main threat was a decline in its habitat caused by deforestation as a result of expanding tourism, agriculture and development.

Originally built between 1801‚Äì1806 by George Burn, it was partially destroyed in the Muckle Spate of 1829, with two of its arches being washed away. Archibald Simpson repaired the bridge in 1831 with a single timber span, which was reconstructed in cast iron in 1853. The bridge is designated a Category A listed building. Description The Old Spey Bridge crosses the River Spey at Fochabers, between the parishes of Bellie and Speymouth. The present structure has three spans, all supported by segmental arches. The two arches at the eastern end, surviving from when the bridge was built, are of ashlar, with large oculi in the rubble-built spandrels between them, and with tooled ashlar cutwaters. The western arch, built to replace two arches that were destroyed in a flood, is of cast iron, supported by three ribs, with lattice grids connecting supporting the roadway to the arch, and is known as the longest cast iron span of its kind in Scotland. A modern metal balustrade runs along the length of the bridge. The bridge is no longer open to road traffic, but is accessible to pedestrians. History Records show that a ferry, known as the boat of bog, crossed the at or around this location since at least the mid-Thirteenth Century. The first bridge at the location, carrying the road from Aberdeen to Inverness, was designed and built by George Burn, working with his brother James, between 1801‚Äì1806; Thomas Telford had also submitted a design for the structure, but this was rejected. The bridge lost its two western arches in a major flooding event, known as the Muckle Spate, in 1829, which saw most of the bridges in Moray washed away. The 5th Duke of Gordon commissioned Archibald Simpson to repair the structure between 1831‚Äì1832; this was done with single span supported by a timber arch. In 1853 the timber arch was reconstructed in cast iron by James Hoby & Co. A road deck was built by James Abernethy & Co in 1912. The carriage was widened in the 1960s, when it carried the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness, but was bypassed around 1970 by a new steel and concrete bridge a short distance downstream, and retained as a footbridge. The bridge was designated a Category B listed building in 1971; it was upgraded to Category A in 1988.

For 18 days, Saudi Arabia denied Khashoggi had died in the consulate, before indicating a team of Saudi agents had overstepped their orders to capture him when a struggle ensued leading to his death. Turkey said it believes the killing was premeditated and approved by the Saudi government, and sought extradition of the suspects. The United States president, Donald Trump, expressed support for Saudi government reserving judgment about culpability. This created a bipartisan uproar in Congress, shaking the foundations of the close American- Saudi relationship with calls for suspension of military sales. Most countries without a direct tie to Saudi Arabia called for a transparent investigation and condemned the killing. Countries with direct ties characterize the aftermath as a media campaign against Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia When the news of disappearance of Khashoggi broke out Saudi Arabia claimed he had left the consulate and denied having any knowledge about his fate. Turkish media published evidence suggesting that Khashoggi never came out of the consulate. Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the case. The international community called for more clarity on the case from Saudi authorities. Meanwhile, the Turkish authorities kept leaking facts from the ongoing investigation of the case that refuted Saudi claims. Saudi Arabia was placed under an unprecedented economic and political pressure from the international community to disclose the facts on this case. On 19 October, the Saudi officials admitted Khashoggi died inside the consulate due to strangulation after an argument and fistfight. Saudi Arabian foreign minister called it a \\"rogue operation\\" and on 25 October the Saudi prosecutor stated that Turkish-supplied evidence indicates the suspects acted with premeditated intention. =Initial denial of involvement= On 3 October, Saudi officials claimed Khashoggi had left the consulate alive, and that he was neither in the consulate nor in Saudi custody. The Saudis denied having any knowledge of his fate. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman claimed Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after the visit. On 8 October, Prince Khalid bin Salman, brother of the Crown Prince and Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., published a letter stating that Khashoggi went missing after leaving the consulate. The English-language Arab News on 10 October 2018 reported that Prince Khalid \\"condemns 'malicious leaks and grim rumors' surrounding Khashoggi disappearance\\" and that \\"the reports that suggest that Jamal Khashoggi went missing in the Consulate in Istanbul or that the Kingdom's authorities have detained him or killed him are absolutely false, and baseless\\". Saudi Arabia threatened to retaliate \\"if it is [targeted by] any action\\". Turki Aldakhil, the head of Al Arabiya, the Saudi-owned pan- Arab news network based in Dubai, wrote that \\"If President Trump was angered by $80 oil, nobody should rule out the price jumping to $100 and $200 a barrel or maybe double that figure.\\" However, the Saudi embassy in Washington said Al Dakhil didn't represent the official position of Saudi Arabia, and Khalid A. Al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said his country \\"will continue to be a responsible actor and keep oil markets stable\\". Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. On 16 October 2018, Saudi Crown Prince met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss the Khashoggi case Saudi Arabia's Office of Public Prosecution tweeted that \\"producing rumors or fake news [that Saudi Arabia's government was involved in the disappearance of Khashoggi] that would affect the public order or public security or sending or resending it via social media or any technical means\\" is punishable \\"by five years and a fine of 3 million riyals\\". Twitter has suspended a number of bot accounts that appeared to be spreading pro-Saudi tweets about the disappearance of Khashoggi. Saudi owned channel, Al Arabiya claimed that reports of Khashoggi's disappearance inside the Saudi consulate have been pushed by Qatar. According to the Saudi daily newspaper Okaz, Qatar has a \\"50 percent ownership of the [Washington] Post and has influence over its editorial direction\\". Saudi daily newspaper Al Yaum has claimed that members of the alleged death squad were, in fact, tourists. The New York Times reported that on 16 October, Saudi Arabia transferred $100 million to the American government, purportedly for its stabilization efforts in Syria, on the same day U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh for the discussion on Khashoggi with the Saudi king, the crown prince, and the foreign minister. Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition against ISIL, dismissed any connection between the events and had expected the payment in the fall. Saudi Arabia had pledged the money in August without confirming any timelines, and it was unclear to one anonymous official if the payment would ever be made. The Washington Post reported that Saudi Arabia has historically made financial largesse to countries with the aim of gaining support for its foreign policy objectives. =Arrests= On 19 October, Washington Post reported that Saudi Arabia has arrested 18 people related to the case without naming them. It has maintained its position denying the involvement of Prince bin Salman or King Salman. Saudi Arabia dismissed five officials of senior rank due to their alleged involvement with the case, including bin Salman's court advisor Saud al-Qahtani, and Ahmad Asiri, the deputy chief of the Saudi intelligence service Maj. Gen. Mohammed bin Saleh al-Rumaih who served as the assistant head of the General Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Abdullah bin Khalifa al-Shaya, the head of General Intelligence for Human Resources; and Gen. Rashad bin Hamed al- Mohammad, the director of the General Directorate of Security and Protection were also fired. The official Saudi Press Agency reported the prosecutor's statement that, based on the preliminary investigation, suspects were found to have traveled to Istanbul to meet Khashoggi, since he had shown an interest in returning to Saudi Arabia. Further discussion with Khashoggi, \\"developed in a negative way... led to a fight and a quarrel between some of them and the citizen... The brawl aggravated to lead to his death and their attempt to conceal and cover what happened.. \\" On 9 November Prince Turki al-Faisal, KSA's ex-intelligence chief said the kingdom would \\"never accept\\" an international investigation into Khashoggi's murder. On 10 November, Reuters reported quoting intelligence sources that there was no indication of the arrest of any suspect. Eleven people have been put on trial, with five to be facing death sentences. Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb and Ahmed al-Asiri, the deputy chief of intelligence, are believed to be among them, as well as Salah Muhammed al-Tubaigy, who along with several others accused, has entered a not guilty plea. Saif Saad al-Qahtani seems not to be on trial. In May 2019, Khashoggi's fianc√©e Hatice Cengiz pleaded with the US and other Western nations to punish Saudi Arabia through sanctions and an international investigation. She said the Saudi authorities had not returned the remains of Khashoggi's body till date, thereby denying him \\"the dignified burial and funeral that he deserves\\". =Admission of involvement= On 20 October, after 18 days of the denial of any involvement with Khashoggi's disappearance, the Saudi government admitted that he had died in the consulate. The Saudi government had issued a press statement after the \\"preliminary investigations\\" by the public prosecution office in Saudi Arabia. It stated that the investigations had \\"revealed that the discussions that took place between [Khashoggi] and the persons who met him... at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul led to a brawl and a fist fight\\". This led to his death followed by the attempts to conceal the evidence. On 20 October, an anonymous official added that 15 Saudi officials had been sent to confront Khashoggi, that a confrontation occurred when he saw them, which resulted in him trying to flee, causing a fight that ended with him being strangled or choked, and a cover-up of the death. No evidence was provided at the time to support this explanation of events, and no information was given regarding the whereabouts of Khashoggi's body. Five high-ranking officials have been removed from their posts, including Saudi royal court advisor Saud al-Qahtani and deputy intelligence chief Ahmad Asiri, and altogether 18 Saudis have been detained in the kingdom. The Saudi government said that it would need another month to investigate the death. On 21 October, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, during an interview with Fox News, for the first time used the term \\"murder\\" for the death of Khashoggi. He stated that individuals acted outside the scope of their authority in a \\"rogue operation\\". According to him, it was a tremendous mistake, and further attempts to cover it up compounded it. He added that Prince Mohammed knew nothing of any plan to kill Khashoggi and that the whereabouts of his body remained a mystery. He assured Khashoggi's family that those responsible would be held accountable. Reuters reported that an anonymous government official provided further detail on the death. He said Khashoggi was allegedly threatened with drugging and kidnapping by Maher Mutreb, resisted and was restrained with a chokehold, which killed him. Mustafa Madani then left through the back door of the consulate dressed in Khashoggi's clothes, with his eyeglasses, with his Apple watch and a fake beard to deceive any observers. Khashoggi's body was rolled up in a carpet and given to a \\"local cooperator\\" for disposal. When questioned about Khashoggi's alleged torture and decapitation, the official said preliminary findings did not suggest that happened. The official provided Saudi documents indicating the operation was part of a wider initiative to bring expatriate dissidents home. The original plan was to keep Khashoggi in an Istanbul safe house for a period where he would be persuaded to return home or eventually released, and Mutreb had overstepped by threatening a kidnapping. The team then filed a false report indicating they let Khashoggi leave after he warned of Turkish police interference. On 25 October, Saudi General Attorney Saud al-Mujeb (ar) said information received from joint working team of Saudi and Turkish investigators \\"indicates that the suspects in the incident had committed their act with a premeditated intention\\". On 6 November, Al-Jazeera quoted a Turkish official saying that Turkey was informed by Saudi Arabia that it will pay \\"diya\\" (financial compensation for murder or bodily harm, under Islamic law) to Khashoggi's sons and fianc√©e. In April 2019, it was reported the four Khashoggi children were given houses believed to be worth up to $4m each, and monthly payments of around $10,000 by Saudis Arabia. On 20 November Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said claims by the CIA's assessment that crown prince Mohammed gave the order to kill Khashoggi are false: \\"The leadership of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques (the king) and the crown prince, is a red line, and we will not permit attempts to harm or undermine them\\". =Changes to the Royal Court= After the Khashoggi assassination, multiple reports indicate that the Saudi regime underwent its worst crisis since the September 11 attacks and the entire House of Saud emerged weakened as a result. The international outrage added pressure to the already divided royal court over Prince Mohammed's rapid ascension to power. On 30 October, former interior minister Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who was seen by academics as a figure of special gravitas and as a critic of his nephew Crown Prince Mohammed, returned from his exile to Riyadh with a private security detail provided by US and UK officials and reassurances for safe passage from the king. He had been living in London for the last six years. According to multiple reports, Prince Ahmed's return was considered the most significant development in the royal family since the assassination and did suggest the Saudi royal family may be trying to internally restructure the dynasty. Saudi dissident, Prince Khaled bin Farhan, said that if the senior princes Ahmed and Muqrin were to unite ranks, then \\"99 percent of the members of the royal family, the security services and the army would stand behind them\\" and could restore the reputation of the family, which has been damaged by King Salman's \\"irrational, erratic and stupid\\" rule. Saudi sources reported Mohammed bin Salman \\"Destroyed the institutional pillars of nearly a century of Al Saud rule: the family, the clerics, the tribes and the merchant families\\" which they considered as \\"destabilizing\\". On 3 November, Crown Prince Mohammed released Khalid bin Talal, the younger brother of Alwaleed bin Talal, after almost a year in prison, which according to Middle East Eye, was an effort to mitigate the effect of his uncle's return. He had refused to make concessions to be referred to a court of law. Their father Prince Talal had been pressing since the 1960s to turn KSA into a constitutional monarchy. Madawi al-Rasheed, professor at the Middle East Centre at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and \\"an important Saudi intellectual in exile\\", wrote: \\"Princes are the only conduit by which the United States knows how to deal with Saudi Arabia, and no normal diplomatic measures exist for holding a rogue prince accountable.\\" According to Reuters, princes from various branches of the Al Saud family opposed the king's favorite son and campaigned to prevent crown prince Mohammed from becoming king. The succession to the throne in KSA is decided by the Allegiance Council, a body where each branch of the ruling family selects the heir they consider fittest to lead. =Social media campaign= According to Saudi women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif, Saudi authorities effectively prevented Saudi citizens from seeing the hashtag #JamalKhashoggi or hashtags containing the word \\"Jamal\\" by swamping Saudi social media, for the first two weeks following Khashoggi's assassination, with the hashtags #Kidnapping_Ant_and_Cockroach and #Aljamal_Jamal_Alrouh. Al-Sharif stated that by late October 2018, the Arabic equivalent of \\"I am Arab and Mohammed bin Salman represents me\\" had become the third-highest trending hashtag worldwide. Al-Sharif interpreted the situation by stating that \\"it became evident to me that we had lost these social media platforms to the dictators.\\" Turkey Protest in front of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan demanded that the Saudi government provide proof for their claims that Khashoggi left the consulate alive, something that police CCTV did not capture. Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program, told Business Insider that \\"The staccato nature of the Turkish response suggests that they were prepared to offer the Saudis a way out of the crisis at least provide them with an off-ramp but given the Saudi response or lack of it, the authorities continue to share more and more details.\\" The politician Numan Kurtulmu≈ü, of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said that \\"it's not possible for the Saudi administration to wiggle itself out of this crime if it's confirmed.\\" On 23 October, President Erdoƒüan spoke for the first time in public about the assassination of Khashoggi. It was a long-awaited speech to the Turkish Parliament. Erdoƒüan gave a minute depiction of the crime from the Turkish point of view, from the minute Khashoggi entered the consulate on 2 October. He rejected the Saudi claim of an \\"accidental killing\\" and stated that Turkey has strong leads to prove it was a \\"premeditated political murder\\" and a \\"ferocious murder\\". Erdoƒüan also made it clear that for him the matter was not settled with the arrest of 18 Saudis, 3 of whom were staff at the Istanbul Consulate: \\"To blame such a case on some security and intelligence officials would not satisfy us or the international community\\", he said. He also added the 18 arrested Saudis would have to be tried in Istanbul. He did not doubt the sincerity of King Salman. In his speech, Erdoƒüan did not once mention the crown prince, who is suspected of ordering the murder. His speech demonstrated that the crisis with Riyadh was far from over. On 26 October, the prosecutor's office in Istanbul submitted an extradition request for the eighteen suspects in the case. President Erdogan asked Saudis to disclose the location of the dead body. He also argued that the suspects should face trial in Turkey. Foreign minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu told reporters that he wanted to know where Khashoggi's body is: \\"There is a crime here, but there is also a humanitarian situation, the family wants to know and they want to perform their last duty\\", referring to the family and friends hopes to bury Khashoggi's body. On 31 October, a Turkish prosecutor reportedly said that Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate building, and that his body was dismembered and disposed of. This was the first such accusation by a Turkish official. His body may have been dissolved in acid, according to Turkish officials. On 10 November Erdogan stated that the audio recordings related to the killing were given to Britain, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia and the United States to maintain the pressure from the international community on Saudi Arabia. SBS reported that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan \\"has been relentless in his pursuit of Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside their consulate in Istanbul. But inside his own country, Erdogan's has used a similar approach to attack local journalists and critics\\", part of a massive purge against Erdoƒüan's perceived enemies. According to Mustafa Kuleli, general secretary of the Journalists Union of Turkey, \\"Journalist organizations in Turkey are trying to cope with colossal problems with very few professionals: thousands of trials against members, news organizations shut down, unemployment, poor working conditions. We are every day in the courts supporting journalists. I understand why time could not be devoted to the Khashoggi case.\\" On 24 January 2019 Turkey announced that it would launch an international investigation in Khashoggi's murder and accused the United States of a cover up. The inquirity is to be led by Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. United States President Donald Trump expressed concern about the fate of Khashoggi, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Saudi Arabia \\"to support a thorough investigation of Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance and to be transparent about the results of that investigation\\". After speaking to the Saudi king by phone, Trump said that Salman \\"denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened... The denial was very, very strong. It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?\\" On 16 October, Trump dispatched Pompeo to Riyadh to meet with King Salman, where he \\"reiterated U.S. concern over Khashoggi's disappearance\\", while also thanking the king for his \\"commitment to a thorough, transparent investigation\\". The reported killing created a bipartisan uproar in Congress, shaking the foundations of the close American-Saudi relationship with calls for suspension of military sales. Senior Republican senator Lindsey Graham's reaction was stern, as he said \\"there would be hell to pay\\" if Saudi is involved in the murder of Khashoggi. He further added, \\"If they're this brazen, it shows contempt. Contempt for everything we stand for, contempt for the relationship.\\" Chris Murphy, a junior Democratic senator, wrote that if the reports are true \\"it should represent a fundamental break in our relationship with Saudi Arabia.\\" Murphy also called for at least a temporary halt in military support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. The United States Congress can block or modify an arms sale. Former ambassador to Saudi Arabia Robert Jordan said on 12 October that he is \\"95 percent certain\\" that Saudi Arabia killed Jamal Khashoggi. Riyadh summit: On 20 May 2017, President Donald Trump signed the United States‚ÄìSaudi Arabia arms deal. Senator Rand Paul said that he would attempt to force a vote on blocking future arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter to Trump over Khashoggi's disappearance. Signed by the entire Committee other than Senator Paul who prepared his own letter, it \\"instructs the administration to determine whether Khashoggi was indeed kidnapped, tortured, or murdered by the Saudi government and, as the Global Magnitsky Act requires, to respond within 120 days with a determination of sanctions against individuals who may have been responsible\\". Senator Bernie Sanders denounced the Trump administration, saying that \\"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman feels emboldened by the Trump administration's unquestioning support.\\" Trump told journalists: \\"I know [Senators] are talking about different kinds of sanctions, but [the Saudis] are spending $110 billion on military equipment and on things that create jobs for this country.\\" Trump, in responding specifically to the Senate's attempt to block the Saudi arms deal, stated that the blocking of such a deal \\"would not be acceptable to me\\".Trump reluctant to punish Saudis over reporter CNN. By \\"Inside Politics\\" reporting section. 13 October 2018. Retrieved 13 October 2018. While opposing trade sanctions, Trump remained open to the possibility of other forms of what he described as the \\"severe punishment\\" of Saudi Arabia. Senator Richard Blumenthal stated: \\"All American businesses and nonprofit organizations should review and re-evaluate their relationships with Saudi Arabia in light of the ... murder, which seemingly could not have been done without knowledge at the highest levels of its government.\\" In the wake of Khashoggi's murder, universities and think tanks faced renewed scrutiny over their close ties to KSA. In March 2018 UC Berkeley, Harvard University, Yale Law School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab, one of the university's most famous laboratories, had accepted a visit from crown prince Mohammad bin Salman. At MIT Media Lab he was shown demos of war-related technologies like autonomous robots which are used for military purposes, made by a company called Boston Dynamics, which is an MIT affiliate. The visits to MIT and Harvard were not widely publicized or accompanied by public events, and the visit was held in spite of protests and petitions demanding its cancellation. In light of the visits and subsequent assassination of Khashoggi, student newspapers called for the schools to cut ties with the Saudi Government. MIT's president L. Rafael Reif has previously defended their relationship with the Saudi government, pointing to a Saudi fellowship which has brought 27 Saudi women PhDs to the school and arguing that \\"not engaging neither creates nor encourages significant positive change\\". The Brookings Institution chose to terminate their sole research grant with the Saudi government on 12 October 12. Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice wrote in The New York Times on 29 October that \\"As this litany of lunacy shows, Prince Mohammed is not and can no longer be viewed as a reliable or rational partner of the United States and our allies.\\" She demanded: \\"We need to stop privileging Jared Kushner's relationship with the crown prince, and finally fill the vacant ambassadorship to the kingdom, to engage with a broader range of senior Saudi officials. President Trump's inexplicable infatuation with Prince Mohammed must end, and he must recalibrate American policy so that it serves our national interests not his personal interests or those of the crown prince.\\" In Washington, a petition launched to rename the section of New Hampshire Avenue where the Saudi embassy is located as \\"Jamal Khashoggi Way\\". After a memorial service for Jamal Khashoggi in London on 29 October 2018, his long-time friend Nihad Awad and head of Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), urged to begin petitions in every city where Riyadh has a diplomatic mission. In a phone call with Crown Prince Mohammed on 11 November, Secretary of State Pompeo ‚Ä≥emphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Khashoggi accountable, and that Saudi Arabia must do the same‚Ä≥. = Nuclear proliferation = In the letter to President Trump on 31 October a group of Republican senators urged a halt on selling US nuclear power equipment to Saudi Arabia. They wrote they have long had reservations about selling nuclear technology and stressed that the Saudis have balked a 123 agreements a civilian nuclear agreement setting non-proliferation standards to prevent the country from building a nuclear weapon by setting limits on uranium enrichment, as well the reprocessing of spent fuels. The senators called for KSA to accept the \\"Gold Standard\\" for nuclear non-proliferaton enshrined in US agreements, especially in light of President Trump's efforts to block Iran's path to a weapon. In an CBS interview in March 2018, Crown Prince Mohammed made clear that even if the KSA were not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, the Saudi adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is conditional and could change suddenly. Henry Sokolski, head of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, deliberated \\"any negotiations regarding a US-Saudi nuclear cooperation agreement should be halted. If the Trump administration refuses to do this, Congress should make clear, as part of its broader response to the Khashoggi killing, that any agreement submitted for review will be blocked.\\" 16 days after Khashoggi was assassinated the Trump administration granted the first authorizations to US-companies to share sensitive nuclear power information with Saudi Arabia. After repeated requests, the US Department of Energy informed the Senate in June 2019 that, of a total of seven permits for nuclear technical expertise transfers. An authorization approval occurred 18 February 2019. In the past, 810 authorizations had been made available for the public to view at department headquarters. US-Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine called the timing of the approvals \\"shocking\\" and said it adds to a \\"disturbing pattern of behavior\\" of the administration's policy on Saudi Arabia. Kaine stated: \\"There is something going on where Saudi Arabia gets just a complete free pass that no other nation in the world gets from this administration. I don't know why that it is but I think we have to dig into it and figure it out. I want to dig into the companies that get the nuclear approval. I think we need to do more work to explore their financial ties to the Trump family.\\" =Visit by Secretary of State Pompeo= According to CNN, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during his visit to Saudi Arabia had told Mohammad Bin Salman that \\"his future as king depends on his handling of Khashoggi's suspected murder.\\" Pompeo stressed that time is short and went on to tell him \\"bluntly that if they don't, the US will have to deal with this\\", and \\"will take action because the world will demand it and that President Trump's hand will be forced by the global pressure\\". On 15 October The Washington Post reported that U.S. pressure on Trump has been bipartisan. Trump said on 19 October that he \\"would prefer if there was going to be some form of sanction\\", adding that \\"we don't use as retribution canceling $110 billion worth of work, which means 600,000 jobs.\\" According to the New York Times, Jamal Khashoggi's disappearance comes \\"at a fraught moment for the Trump administration, which is expected to reimpose harsh sanctions against Iran on November 5, with the intent of cutting off all Iranian oil exports. But to make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing... and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.\\" =Response of President Trump after confirmation of killing= Commenting on the Saudi explanation that Khashoggi died inside the consulate after a fight, Trump said he considered it credible and called the official statement a \\"good first step\\". Several Republican senators, including Marco Rubio, Lindsay Graham, Bob Corker, and Rand Paul, have demanded a definitive response from the Trump administration towards Saudi Arabia, with the Trump administration yet remaining unwilling to impose any specific sanctions on the country.GOP senators urge consequences for Saudi Arabia, as Trump warns against rush to judgment Fox News Channel.

In response to Trump's apparent faith in the most recently revised official Saudi version of the killing, The Washington Post CEO Fred Ryan said, \\"The Saudis cannot be allowed to fabricate a face-saving solution to an atrocity that appears to have been directed by the highest levels of their government.\\" In a 20 October interview with the Washington Post, Trump said about changes in the Saudi statements: \\"Obviously there's been deception and there's been lies\\", but he had not seen any evidence confirming the involvement of the Crown prince so far. When asked about his ways and possibility of sanctions on Saudi Arabia, Trump did not answer stating it was too early. On 21 October, Trump affirmed to reporters in the White House that he was \\"not satisfied\\" with Saudi Arabia's explanation, criticising their requested one month to investigate the situation themselves. He said he had \\"people over in Saudi Arabia now. We have top intelligence people in Turkey, and we're going to see what we have. I'll know a lot tomorrow.\\" However, he was hesitant to cancel the arms sale deal with Saudi Arabia. CNN reported that, according to sources, CIA director Gina Haspel was traveling to Turkey that day in relation to the Turkish Khashoggi investigation. When asked about this report the CIA did not offer comment. That day when questioned by reporters at the oval office, Trump said of the Saudis' actions after Khashoggi's death that \\"They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly, and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups. They had the worst-cover up ever\\". In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that Mohammad bin Salman may have been behind Khashoggi's death. US officials have stated that the killing could not have been done without having the authorization of Prince bin Salman who is the de facto ruler. According to anonymous US officials, the CIA has concluded that Mohammed bin Salman ordered the assassination; the conclusion is based on multiple sources, including a phone call in which Khalid bin Salman, brother of Mohammed bin Salman and Saudi Ambassador to the U.S., assured Khashoggi would be safe go to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to retrieve the documents for the marriage. A Saudi Embassy spokeswoman stated \\"the claims in this purported assessment are false\\" and Khalid bin Salman denied talking to Khashoggi by phone or suggesting that he should to go to Turkey. On 13 November 2018, President Trump announced the nomination of retired Army Gen. John Abizaid as U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, a post that was vacant for nearly two years. =Sanctions on Saudi individuals= On 23 October, Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the US was taking action against 21 Saudi individuals they believed were involved in Khashoggi's death, who will have their visas revoked or will be made ineligible for one. He also said he talked to the Treasury Department about the applicability of sanctions against those involved. CNBC Politics. By Kevin Breuninger. CNBC. 23 October 2018. Retrieved 23 October 2018. On 15 November, The US treasury department declared that it has imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials who it said had \\"targeted and brutally killed\\" Khashoggi, who lived and worked in the US, and that these 17 individuals \\"must face consequences for their actions\\". The list of sanctioned included Qahtani, Mutreb, and Alotaibi. The declaration stated \\"Saud al-Qahtani is a senior official of the Government of Saudi Arabia who was part of the planning and execution of the operation that led to the killing... This operation was coordinated and executed by his subordinate Maher Mutreb... The Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where Mr. Khashoggi was killed, was overseen by Consul General Mohammed Alotaibi.\\" =CIA assessment= On 16 November 2018, a CIA assessment was leaked to the media that with \\"high confidence\\" crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination. Regardless, President Trump continued to disregard his own CIA assessment.\\"Trump: CIA 'Didn't Conclude' Saudi Crown Prince Ordered Khashoggi Death: President Disagrees with His Own Intelligence Agency After a Report Said It Had Assessed Mohammed bin Salman Did Order the Murder\\". The Guardian, 22 November 2018 Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, who was briefed by the CIA on the assessment stated that President Trump was lying about the CIA findings. Under mounting pressure from lawmakers who wanted action against KSA, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in a rare closed briefing addressing the Senate, declared there was no direct evidence linking the crown prince to the Khashoggi's assassination. Many lawmakers were furious that CIA Director Gina Haspel, the only Trump cabinet member who listened to the audio recordings of the assassination in Istanbul, did not participate in the briefing, as they had requested. After a small group of bipartisan senators were briefed by CIA Director Haspel on 4 December 2018, their takeaway was dramatically different from that of the administration. Even leading Republican senators distanced themselves from President Trump and stated they are certain that Mohammed bin Salman indeed ordered the assassination. Bob Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign relations committee, affirmed immediately after the Haspel briefing: \\"I have zero question in my mind that the crown prince ordered the killing, monitored the killing, knew exactly what was happening. If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. Guilty. So the question is, 'What do we do about that?'\\". Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of President Trump, emerged from the Haspel briefing more convinced than ever that Mohammed bin Salman was \\"complicit\\". He told reporters on Capitol Hill that \\"there's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw\\", in reference to the medical device the Saudi kill team allegedly used to dismember Khashoggi. He acknowledged: \\"The crown prince is a wrecking ball. I think he's complicit in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi to the highest level possible. I think his behavior before the Khashoggi murder was beyond disturbing. And I cannot see him being a reliable partner to the United States. If the Saudi government is going to be in the hands of this man for a long time to come, I find it very difficult to be able to do business because I think he's crazy, I think he is dangerous.\\" A former Saudi intelligence chief and senior member of the Saudi royal family Prince, Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, dismissed the CIA's finding that Khashoggi's murder was ordered directly by Mohammed bin Salman, saying that \\"The CIA has been proved wrong before. Just to mention the invasion of Iraq for example. The CIA is not necessarily the best measure of creditable intelligence reporting or intelligence assessment.\\" United Nations On 18 October 2018 at a press conference at the United Nations four major human rights groups demanded an independent UN investigation into Khashoggi's assassination. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Amnesty International (AI), Human Rights Watch (HRW), and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) called on Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres to appoint an investigator. The UN team should be allowed full access to any sites and allowed to interview witnesses or suspects without interference. KSA should immediately waive diplomatic protections and Turkey should turn over all evidence in its possession, including audio and visual records that Turkish officials have claimed reveal Khashoggi's murder. AI's head of the New York office, Sherine Tadros, pointed to Saudi Arabia's human rights record: \\"This incident didn't happen in a vacuum. Jamal Khashoggi is not one case that is an anomaly. It happened in a context of an increased crackdown on dissent since June 2017 when the crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman took his position.\\" CPJ's Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney said at the press conference: \\"This sends an incredibly chilling signal to journalists around the world that their lives don't matter and that states can have you murdered with impunity.\\" \\"UN involvement is the best guarantee against a Saudi whitewash or attempts by other governments to sweep the issue under the carpet to preserve lucrative business ties with Riyadh.\\" Louis Charbonneau, the UN Director at HRW, said: \\"If in fact it's true, that the most senior members of the Saudi government were behind the execution and dismemberment of Mr. Khashoggi, then we don't want the culprits investigating themselves.\\" \\"Only the UN has the credibility and independence required to expose the masterminds behind Khashoggi's enforced disappearance and to hold them accountable.\\" Christophe Deloire, Secretary-General of RSF, wrote: \\"Any attempt to get rid of the pressure on Saudi Arabia and to accept a compromise policy would result in giving a 'license to kill' to a Kingdom that puts in jail, lashes, kidnaps and even kills journalists who dare to investigate and launch debates\\". Amnesty, the CPJ, HRW and RSF stated that the Saudi-Turkish investigation group will be unable to make progress in the face of KSA's denials of any involvement. On 19 October 2018 Secretary-General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres stated that the confirmation of the death of prominent dissident journalist has \\"deeply troubled\\" him. An official statement said \\"The Secretary-General is deeply troubled by the confirmation of the death of Jamal Khashoggi. He extends his condolences to Mr. Khashoggi's family and friends. ... The Secretary-General stresses the need for a prompt, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Khashoggi's death and full accountability for those responsible\\". Between 28 January and 3 February 2019 UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, who is leading an international human rights inquiry into the murder, visited Turkey. The preliminary report on the inquiry, published on 7 February, concluded that Khashoggi \\"was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the State of Saudi Arabia\\". The full report, released on 19 June, further affirmed these conclusions, also tying the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, to the assassination.\\"'Credible evidence' ties Saudi prince to Khashoggi murder, UN expert says,\\" The Times of Israel, 19 June 2019. Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that he has \\"real concerns\\" about the disappearance of Khashoggi. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland \\"reaffirmed (Canada's) commitment to defending freedom of expression and protection of the free press\\" and raised the issue directly with her Saudi counterpart, calling for \\"a thorough, credible and transparent investigation into the serious allegations about Mr. Kashoggi's disappearance.\\" She added that \\"Canada remains very troubled by (his) disappearance.\\" On 22 October, after preliminary findings of the Saudi investigation emerged, Global Affairs Canada said \\"The explanations offered to date lack consistency and credibility.\\" It reiterated Canada's condemnation of the killing and condolence to the family and urged investigators to work with Turkey toward justice. When asked about a pending sale of 742 Light Armoured Vehicles to Saudi Arabia in light of Khashoggi's death and the Yemeni war during question period in Parliament on 22 October, Trudeau said: \\"We have frozen export permits before when we had concerns about their potential misuse and we will not hesitate to do so again.\\" The contract, with London, Ontario's General Dynamics Land Systems Canada, is estimated at $15 billion. However, Canada will be respecting the export permits that have already been issued. Canadian ministers and embassy staff had skipped attending the business summit in Riyadh due to the incident. At the request of Prime Minister Trudeau spy chief David Vigneault departed for Turkey to work on the investigation. Vigneault, the director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, listened to the recording of the Turkish authorities of Khashoggi's assassination and upon his return provided a briefings to Trudeau as well as other Canadian officials. ;Joint statement * On 24 October, Trudeau had a telephonic conversation with German Chancellor Merkel after which they released a joint statement reaffirming \\"their shared commitment to freedom of the press\\". Both leaders \\"strongly agreed on the need for transparency and accountability for those who committed this act\\". The foreign ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) nations called for a thorough and credible investigation, saying Saudi Arabia must ensure such an incident could never happen again. Europe *: On 13 October, the European Union requested a detailed investigation of the incident. On 20 October the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini issued a formal statement saying: \\"The emerging circumstances of Jamal Khashoggi's death are deeply troubling, including the shocking violation of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and particularly Article 55 ... Therefore the European Union, like its partners, insists on the need for continued thorough, credible and transparent investigation, shedding proper clarity on the circumstances of the killing and ensuring full accountability of all those responsible for it.\\" *: Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl described the case as \\"profoundly shocking\\" and an unprecedented violation of the law and said that the European Union should halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia. * requested a detailed investigation of the incident on 13 October. On 26 October, French president Emmanuel Macron declared that he did not want to reconsider weapon sells to Riyad, stating \\"It will be pure demagogy to stop selling weapons\\" to Riyad as a response to the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. *: Observers have lashed out at Trump for refusing to punish the Saudis. Norbert R√∂ttgen, chairman of the German parliamentary foreign affairs committee, criticized Donald Trump's comments: \\"The decisive factor now is the behaviour of the U.S. president, who basically told the crown prince, we are giving you free rein as long as you buy enough weapons and other things from us.\\" :Germany described the Saudi explanation as \\"inadequate\\", and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas questioned if weapons should be sold to Saudi Arabia by countries. On 21 October, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected the Saudi statement that confirmed the killing and called for transparency and accountability in the case. She stated that Germany will not export arms to Saudi Arabia until the questions related to the case are resolved, and the persons responsible in the case are held accountable. On 25 October Chancellor Merkel condemned in a telephone call with the Saudi King Salman the killing of Khashoggi \\"in the strongest terms\\" and demanded \\"to ensure a swiftly, transparent and credible investigation\\". With regard to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, Merkel called on Saudi Arabia to do everything in its power to effectively facilitate access to humanitarian aid. Leading Greens politician Ska Keller said: \\"EU countries must not continue to turn a blind eye to the serious human rights violations committed by the Saudi government.\\" On 19 November 2018 Germany halted even those arms sales to the KSA, that were previously approved. *: Due to political divisions, Norway reached a consensus that the Saudi explanation was \\"ridiculous\\". In the beginning of November, Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide had summoned the Saudi ambassador to protest the assassination of Khashoggi. After a week, on 9 November, Norway became the second country after Germany to stop the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia, over the \\"recent developments\\" in Saudi Arabia and situation in Yemen. *: Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia \\"cannot start deteriorating relations\\" with Saudi Arabia because \\"it did not know what really happened\\" and \\"the journalist that disappeared lived in the US. In this sense, of course, the US holds a certain responsibility over what happened to him.\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia hopes the results of the joint Turkish-Saudi investigation will be made public. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that Russia's official position was set out by President Putin. The Saudi royal family's statement condemning the incident and stating that the royal family was not involved makes everything else a matter of investigation. He also stated that there is no reason not to believe the statement. The Russian envoys to Indonesia and the United Kingdom stated the US' and UK' response to the disappearance of Khashoggi demonstrates London's and Washington's double standards toward Russia and other countries. *: Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez defended the decision to continue arms sales to Saudi Arabia and insisted on his government's \\"responsibility\\" to protect jobs in the arms industry. The foreign ministry said it was also \\"upset\\" by the statements of Saudi Arabia regarding the killing of Khashoggi, according to a written statement from Spain's Ankara Embassy on Monday. The statement said the perpetrators of the incident should pay the price of it before justice \\"after a wide-scoped and transparent investigation\\" and also offers their condolences to Khashoggi's family. Podemos party and Catalan pro-independence parties criticized links between Spanish royal family and Saudi Arabia. *: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met the Saudi ambassador and warned Saudi Arabia that the long-term friendship between the UK and Saudi Arabia depends on \\"shared values\\". Hunt rejected calls to end weapons sales, saying: \\"There are jobs in the UK ... at stake so when it comes to the issue of arms sales we have our procedures.\\" The Labour Party's Shadow First Secretary of State, Emily Thornberry, criticized Theresa May's government's response to Khashoggi's disappearance as 'too little, too late'. Thornberry was critical of UK-Saudi relations, saying: \\"Imagine how this government would have reacted if either Russia or Iran had abducted ‚Äì and in all likelihood murdered ‚Äì one of their dissident journalists within the sovereign territory of another country.\\" :The Labour Party's leader Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade Barry Gardiner called for the suspension of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia. :The British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt paid an official visit to KSA and called for its cooperation with a \\"credible\\" investigation into Khashoggi's killing. Corbyn also called for an international investigation into the murder of Khashoggi and Saudi's war crimes in Yemen. Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable said: \\"This situation gets murkier and murkier. The Government should have already suspended arms export licences to Saudi Arabia given the outrages in Yemen. This reinforces the argument for loosening the bonds to the regime.\\" :On 19 October diplomat and former chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), John Sawers, told the BBC that all the evidence suggested crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind the death of Khashoggi, and that the theory that rogue elements in the Saudi military were responsible was \\"blatant fiction\\". He stated he did not believe the crown prince Mohammed would have acted in the way he did unless he believed he had been given \\"licence\\" to do so by the US administration of Donald Trump: \\"I think President Trump and his ministerial team are waking up to just how dangerous it is to have people acting with a sense that they have impunity in their relationship with the United States.\\" :British foreign minister Hunt, spoke to his Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir, on 21 October to convey the British view that the explanation provided was not entirely credible. On 23 October 2018 Hunt wrote he was \\"deeply concerned\\" to hear Erdoƒüan's describe Khashoggi's murder as \\"premeditated\\": \\"The world is still waiting for answers\\". :On 30 September 2019 an edition of the BBC's Panorama programme investigated the case and included interviews with some of the few people who had listened to covert recordings from inside the diplomatic building. ;Joint statements *: On 21 October responding to the statement from Saudi Arabia confirming the death of Khashoggi in a fist fight, France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement expressing shock and condemning the killing of Khashoggi, saying there is an \\"urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened\\". The statement mentioned the Saudi explanation of the events and added: \\"There remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened... beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible.\\" :On 19 November 2018 the Schengen zone, which includes most EU countries and non-EU members Norway and Switzerland, with the UK imposed travel bans on 18 Saudi nationals allegedly implicated in Khashoggi's assassination.  Arab world Al Jazeera reported on 13 October that \\"the Arab world stays silent... there's been no official reaction from any Arab government, and hardly any condemnation from Arab media.\\" Another news outlet, Middle East Eye, reported on 15 October that \\"Largely silent until Sunday, Arab leaders come out publicly in support of the kingdom after US President Donald Trump threatens 'severe punishment'.\\" * Arab League: On 14 October, the Arab League denounced any political pressure applied on Saudi Arabia and stated in an official response \\"It is totally unacceptable, in the context of relations between countries, to wave economic sanctions as a policy or tool to achieve political goals.\\" *: The foreign ministry released a statement that Saudi Arabia is \\"the essential foundation for the security and stability of the Arab and Islamic worlds and the solid foundation and strong pillar of stability in the region\\". *: Ahmed Hafidh, a foreign ministry spokesman, said that \\"Egypt reaffirms its support for the kingdom in its efforts and positions dealing with this event.\\" *: The Republic of Djibouti expressed its full solidarity with the brotherly Kingdom and condemned the media campaign against Saudi Arabia. *: Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who himself was in 2017 allegedly kidnapped and forced to resign in Saudi Arabia,Lebanon's Hariri visits UAE as home crisis escalates, Reuters, \\"[Saad Hariri's] resignation has thrust Lebanon back into the frontline of the regional rivalry that pits a mostly Sunni bloc led by Saudi Arabia and allied Gulf monarchies against Shi'ite Iran and its allies.\\" said in a statement that he stood in solidarity with Saudi Arabia \\"in the face of the campaigns targeting it\\". According to Rami George Khouri, a professor of journalism at the American University of Beirut, \\"The case of Jamal Khashoggi, unfortunately, is only the tip of the iceberg... it would only be the most dramatic example of a trend that has been ongoing for at least 30 to 40 years, but which has escalated under [Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman]\\". ** Hezbollah: Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech: \\"I tell the Saudi rulers that now is the right time to take a bold and brave stance and stop the war on Yemen... The international cover for their war on Yemen has started to crumble, especially after Khashoggi incident.

And that's why I'm saying [the Khashoggi case] is a wake-up call for everyone.\\" Protest in Tunis against the visit of Mohammed bin Salman, 26 November 2018 *: On 26 and 27 November 2018, amid Mohammed bin Salman's first trip abroad after he was accused of ordering the assassination of Khashoggi, he encountered public anger while his visit in Tunis. Protests were accompanied by statements from Tunisian unions and a dozen civil society groups decrying crown prince Mohammed's visit as an \\"attack on the principles\\" of the Arab Spring that bought democracy and freedom of expression to Tunisia. Since the Arab Spring movement began in late 2010 in Tunisia, which unseated entrenched rulers in the region, Tunisia had undergone a democratic transition and is one of the few Arab countries to allow demonstrations. These were the first protests in the Arab world against Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. :Activists had tried to have a court bar him from entering Tunisia. At the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists headquarters a giant banner depicted a cartoon of Mohammed bin Salman with a chainsaw and inscription reading \\"No to the desecration of Tunisia, the land of the revolution\\".
