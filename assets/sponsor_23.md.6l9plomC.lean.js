Originally built in 1868, it was remodelled in a Neoclassical style by Enric Sagnier between 1906 and 1911. The house forms part of a row of buildings known as the Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (or Mansana de la Disc√≤rdia, the \\"Block of Discord\\"). The Illa de la Disc√≤rdia derives its name from its clashing architectural styles, and while the block is best known for its Modernista architecture (most notably Antoni Gaud√≠'s Casa Batll√≥ of 1906), the more sober Neoclassical style of Casa Mulleras contrasts sharply with its more opulent neighbours. History The Ramon Comas house was originally built by Pau Martorell in 1868. In 1906 it was acquired by Ramon Mulleras who commissioned Enric Sagnier to renovate the facade. While Sagnier's architectural portfolio included buildings designed in a variety of styles, including Gothic Revival and the Modernista style, he redesigned Casa Mulleras in a Neoclassical style, completing his work in 1911. Despite its relatively restrained design in comparison to the neighbouring properties, Casa Mulleras incorporates some eclectic features derived from Rococo architecture such as the gallery and the balconies.

The first volumes in the series were published by Scarecrow Press from 1967 and were organised by country and continent, but the series has since expanded into a wide range of cultural and political topics. The dictionaries are arranged using a common structure and most have a single author. They seek to provide the historical context for current events. Background Scarecrow Press was founded by Ralph R. Shaw in 1950 to show that scholarly books could be published on a tight budget. One of its editors described it as a \\"bare-bones, quick-turnaround publisher which produced books for librarians and scholars. There were no book jackets, the covers were fairly ordinary, and the typesetting was not justified.\\" History The first books in the Historical Dictionary series were Latin American country volumes published in 1967. African and Asian countries followed in the 1970s, and lastly, European and Oceanic countries. Later the series expanded into areas such as culture,Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema, Review by Roger Macy, The Japan Society. Retrieved 12 June 2019. religion, and political philosophy. There is a complementary series of Area Bibliographies. Most of the dictionaries have a single author, a practice described as \\"highly unusual\\" in dictionary compilation, and Jon Woronoff, editor of the Asian series, has described the difficulty of finding suitable authors for some of the smaller countries, which meant that the African series, for instance, took 25 years to complete. Once published, however, the volumes on the difficult countries potentially had more impact than those for which similar works already existed. The Scarecrow Press imprint was subsequently owned by Grolier and is now owned by Rowman & Littlefield. Selected volumes in the series are available in paperback as \\"A to Z Guides\\".The A to Z Guide Series. Rowman & Littlefield. Retrieved 12 June 2019. Content The dictionaries tend to follow a uniform format of a chronology, introduction, the historical dictionary, and a bibliography with supplementary material such as maps, abbreviations, place name changes, or notes on language according to the subject. The main section is the historical dictionary which covers events, people and places, and additional topics appropriate to the subject. The bibliographies are organised by subject and may range from 50 to 100 pages. Jon Woronoff has described the philosophy of the series as being to focus on current events with the historical content in the books limited to that necessary to understand those events. Other historical material is relegated to separate volumes on ancient history.\\"The 'Asian Historical Dictionary' Series\\", Jon Woronoff, IIAS Newsletter, No. 7 (Winter 1996). Criticism In his 1980 review article of the African volumes, David C. Tambo noted that the Historical Dictionaries had been subject to an unusually high level of criticism for a reference series. While librarians had lauded the works for filling a long-standing gap in the scholarly literature, academics complained about poor editorial choices, uneven quality, and a lack of factual accuracy. These failings were described as particularly regrettable where the volume covered a niche area for which a competing volume might never be produced. Tambo attributed the unevenness in quality to the practice of the publishers of using a single author for each volume, who often was not an historian, possibly in an attempt to save money. He concluded that although there was a need to collate this sort of material in one place, the African volumes reviewed had not met that need.\\"Review: African Historical Dictionaries in Perspective\\" by David C.

She lives and works in Birsfelden near Basel.  Life  Growing up in Basel, she came into contact with art at an early age (Museums in Basel, Art Basel). During college, she took drawing classes at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung Basel (Basel School of Design). From 1979 to 1983 she studied at the University of Art and Design (Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung und Kunst Basel) in Basel. In addition to her main studies, she attended lectures on film history, which she completed with the exhibition Architektur f√ºr die Nacht ‚Äì Kino-Architektur 1990 in the Swiss Architecture Museum.Rosa Lachenmeier and Werner Jehle: Architektur f√ºr die Nacht ‚Äì Kino- Architektur, ed. Swiss Architecture Museum (exhibition catalog), Basel 1990, . From 1985 to 2018 she taught as a lecturer at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung Basel. Since 1985 she has participated as a visual artist in exhibitions and art fairs. From 1993 regular stays and exhibitions in Amsterdam.  Work  In her art work, Rosa Lachenmeier mainly combines painting and photography, setting new accents in the fields of collage.Roland Nachtig√§ller, Burkhard Leismann (Hrsg.): Ruhe-St√∂rung ‚Äì Streifz√ºge durch die Welten der Collage. Kunstmuseum Ahlen und MARTa Herford, 2013, p. 197. Immediately after her studies, she explored the possibilities of using everyday objects such as vinyl records, plates or shirts as image carrier for her paintings. With her screen objects in the late 1980s, she reflected on media conditions of our time and with the focus on a global view on the earth she asked questions about our constantly changing perception.Robert Schiess: Rosa Lachenmeier ‚Äì Weltbilder. BookART, Basel 1992. p. 5‚Äì13. In the 1990s, she devoted herself to the artist's book as the bearer of an artistic concept, sometimes as a dialogue of word and image, sometimes as a visual sequence of pictorial metamorphoses. These artist's books are distributed by Printed Matter, Inc.Printed Matter bookstore at Dia: We ship Books around the World.

Galerie M√§der, Basel 2009, , p. 9‚Äì12. In doing so, she arranges groups of paintings of different formats over and over again, depending on the architectural circumstances. Another focus is on groups of works dedicated to individual cities.Heinz Stahlhut, Patrick Marcolli: Rosa Lachenmeier ...and then we take Berlin. Galerie M√§der, Basel 2014, . On her forays, she captures her impressions with the camera at different times of day and night from different perspectives, so that there are always new perspectives. This results in condensed, cinematic compositions of photography and painting.  Exhibitions  = Special Location = In the Special Location series, Rosa Lachenmeier shows her works in exceptional locations such as the interior of a bridge in Cologne (Subkulinaria, 2008) or in the historic ship named Willi (since 2015).Nana Badenberg, Roswitha Frey: Magic ‚Äì Rosa Lachenmeier, Kunst im Schiff Willi, Basler Rheinhafen, August 2015.

She was awarded the European Geosciences Union Plinius Medal in 2018 and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2019 Birthday Honours.  Early life and education  Cloke studied geography at the University of Bristol where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1999 and a PhD in 2003. Cloke worked at the Joint Research Centre on the European Flood Awareness System.  Research and career  Cloke joined the Department of Geography at King's College London. She was part of the Europeanizing Flood Forecasting program, which looked at flood forecasting and management in the European Union. She joined the University of Reading in 2012, where she is a Professor of Hydrology. Cloke co-directs the Water@Reading group, which concentrates on water science, policy and societal impacts. She is the Director of the Natural Environment Research Council programme Flooding from Intense Rainfall. She is interested in flood forecasting and risk management, leading the project TENDERLY (Towards END-to End flood forecasting and a tool for ReaL-time catchment susceptibilitY). She works with the Met Office, Environmental Agency and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Cloke's Global Flood Awareness System is a partnership between the European Commission and the ECMWF, and provides hydrological monitoring and forecasting that is independent of political boundaries. She was also involved with the Natural Environment Research Council projects Susceptibility of catchments to INTense RAinfall and flooding (SINATRA) and Improving Predictions of Drought for User Decision-Making (IMPETUS). Cloke believes that climate change will make flooding more probable and that we should start to take precautions to protect homes and livelihoods. Cloke's research helps policymakers make better decisions about flood preparation. She has discussed the problems with the United Kingdom's flood defence systems. She called for the National Flood Resilience Review to evaluate how flood risks are likely to change in different locations across the United Kingdom. She is supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme. In 2019 Cloke created IMPREXive, a game that allowed players to control flood forecasting during a deluge. The information provided to the players is not always correct; and decisions must be made to keep cities safe.

Colonial Caricature of gambling, showing a number of men ‚Äî and one woman ‚Äî at an early roulette table, ca. 1800. Games of chance came to the British-American colonies with the first settlers. Attitudes toward gambling varied greatly from community to community, but there were no large-scale restrictions on the practice at the time. By the 1680s, an emerging upper class in Virginia cemented their economic status through an iron grip on gambling in horse racing. Heavy betters demonstrated their courage and skill while promoting a sense of shared values and consciousness among the social elite. This group of wealthy Virginian landowners made elaborate rules, established by formal codes that dictated how much to bet, and marginalized the role of the non-elite. They developed a code of honor regarding acquisitiveness, individualism, materialism, personal relationships, and the right to be rulers. Not until the mid-18th century, when Baptists and Methodists denounced gambling as sinful, was there any challenge to the social, political, and economic dominance of this Virginian over-class.Timothy H. Breen, \\"Horses and gentlemen: The cultural significance of gambling among the gentry of Virginia.\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1977): 239-257. online Historian Neal Millikan found approximately 392 lotteries that were held in the 13 colonies using newspaper advertisements in the colonial era. Lotteries were used not only as a form of entertainment but as a source of revenue to help fund each of the original 13 colonies. The financiers of Jamestown, Virginia funded lotteries to raise money to support their colony. These lotteries often featured instant winners. In 1769, a restriction was placed on lotteries by the British Crown and became one of many issues that fueled tensions between the Colonies and Britain before the American Revolution. Early national trends A Sunday cock-fighting event in early New Orleans. Lotteries continued to be used at the state and federal level in pre- revolutionary America. New Orleans emerged as the nation's leading gambling center. A wave of hostility against the sinfulness of gambling emerged in the religious revivals that comprised the Second Great Awakening and the Third Great Awakening. Moralists concentrated on state legislatures, passing laws to restrict gambling, pleasure halls, horse racing, and violations of the Sabbath (working on Sundays). Despite the attempted restrictions, gambling houses grew in popularity in various communities across the colonies. Local judge Jacob Rush told men \\"that not all sports were banned, only those associated with gambling. Unadulterated amusement was permissible\\". Rush continued to condemn gambling as immoral, because \\"it tyrannises the people beyond their control, reducing them to poverty and wretchedness. The mind is deeply contaminated, and sentiments, the most hostile to its final peace and happiness, are harbored and indulged.\\"J. Thomas Jable, \\"Aspects of Moral Reform in Early Nineteenth-Century Pennsylvania.\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 102.3 (1978): 344-363. pp 346-47. Gambling was made illegal and forced to relocate to safe havens such as New Orleans or on riverboats where the captain was the only law in force. Anti-gambling movements shut down the lotteries. As railroads replaced riverboat travel, other venues were closed. The increasing pressure of legal prohibitions on gambling created risks and opportunities for illegal operations. Frontier From 1848 to 1855, the California Gold Rush attracted ambitious young prospectors from around the world, to prospect for gold and gamble away were two sides of their manliness.Christopher Herbert, \\"' Life's Prizes Are by Labor Got': Risk, Reward, and White Manliness in the California Gold Rush.\\" Pacific Historical Review 80.3 (2011): 339-368. online By the 1850s, the influx of aspiring prospectors had made San Francisco a world-famous city. San Francisco had overtaken New Orleans as the gambling capital of the US. However, as respectability set in, California gradually strengthened its laws and its policing of gambling; the games went underground. Gambling was popular on the frontier during the settlement of the West; nearly everyone participated in games of chance. Towns at the end of the cattle trails such as Deadwood, South Dakota or Dodge City, Kansas, and major railway hubs such as Kansas City and Denver were famous for their many lavish gambling houses. Frontier gamblers had become the local elite. At the top of the line, riverboat gamblers dressed smartly, wore expensive jewelry, and exuded refined respectability. Late 19th century Horse racing was an expensive hobby for the very rich, especially in the South, but the Civil War destroyed the affluence it rested upon. The sport made a come back in the Northeast, under the leadership of elite jockey clubs that operated the most prestigious racetracks. As a spectator sport, the races attracted an affluent audience, as well as struggling, working-class gamblers. The racetracks closely controlled the situation to prevent fraud and keep the sport honest. Off-track, bookmakers relied upon communication systems such as the telegraph and a system of runners which attracted a much wider audience. However, the bookmakers paid off the odds that were set honestly at the racetrack.Steven Riess, \\"The Cyclical History of Horse Racing: The USA's Oldest and (Sometimes) Most Popular Spectator Sport\\" International Journal of the History of Sport (2014) 31#1 pp 29-54 =Chicago= In Chicago, like other rapidly growing industrial centers with large immigrant and migrant working-class neighborhoods, gambling was a major issue, and in some contexts a vice. The city's wealthy urban elite had private clubs and closely supervised horse racing tracks. The workers, who discovered freedom and independence in gambling, discovered a world apart from their closely supervised factory jobs. They gambled to validate the risk- taking aspect of masculinity, betting heavily on dice, card games, policy, and cockfights. Already by the 1850s, hundreds of saloons offered gambling opportunities, including off-track betting on the horses.See Christopher Thale, \\"Gambling\\" Encyclopedia of Chicago (2004)Richard C. Lindberg, Chicago by Gaslight: A History of Chicago's Netherworld: 1880-1920 (2005) excerpt Historian Mark Holler, argues that organized crime provided upward mobility to ambitious people in poverty-stricken non-white communities. The high-income, high-visibility vice lords and racketeers built their careers and profits in these low-income neighborhoods, often branching into local politics to protect their domains.Mark H. Haller, \\"Organized Crime in Urban Society: Chicago in the Twentieth Century\\" Journal of Social History (1971) 5#2 pp. 210-234 Online For example, in 1868‚Äì1888, Chicago linchpin, Michael C. McDonald‚Äî\\"The Gambler King of Clark Street\\"‚Äîkept numerous Democratic machine politicians on expense accounting to protect his gambling empire and keep the reformers at bay. In larger cities, the exploitation, inherent in illegal gambling and prostitution, was restricted to geographically-segregated red-light districts. The business owners, both legitimate and illicit, were pressured into making scheduled payments to corrupt police and politicians, which they disguised as a licensing expense. The informal rates became standardized, for example, in Chicago in 1912, in ranges of $20 a month for a cheap brothel to $1000 a month for luxurious bordellos. Reformist elements never accepted the segregated vice districts and they wanted them all permanently shut down. In large cities, an influential system of racketeers and a vicious clique of vice lords was economically, socially and politically powerful enough to keep the reformers and upright law-enforcement at bay. Finally, around 1900‚Äì1910, the reformers with the support of law enforcement and legislative backing, grew politically strong enough to shut down the destructive system of vice and the survivors went underground.Perry Duis, The Saloon: Public Drinking in Chicago and Boston, 1880-1920 (1983) pp 230-73. 20th century =Numbers racket= Segregated neighborhoods in larger cities starting in the late 19th century were the scene of numerous underground \\"numbers games\\", typically controlled by criminals who paid off the local police, they operated out of inconspicuous \\"policy shops\\" usually a saloon, where bettors chose numbers. In 1875, a report of a select committee of the New York State Assembly stated that \\"the lowest, meanest, worst form ... [that] gambling takes in the city of New York, is what is known as policy playing\\". The game was also popular in Italian neighborhoods known as the Italian lottery, and it was known in Cuban communities as bolita (\\"little ball\\"). Holice and Debbie, Our Police Protectors: History of New York Police Chapter 13, Part 1 . Accessed on 4/2/2005 In the early 20th century, the game was associated with big-city slums and could be played for pennies. The bookies would even extend credit, and there were no deductions for taxes. also online free to borrow Illegal gambling, which had the same organizers and support systems as illegal liquors in the 1920s, lead to powerful criminal syndicates in most large cities.John Burnham, Bad Habits (1993) pp 63-66 =Reformers= Reformers led by the evangelical (Protestant) Christian movement, succeeded in passing state laws that closed nearly all the race tracks by 1917. However, slot machines, gambling houses, betting parlors, and policy games flourished, just as illegal alcohol did during Prohibition. The Prohibition of most forms of alcohol, was an important reform for changes in social terms and health terms in America, but in the 1920s, due to the passing of anti-prohibition legislation, much of their influence was discredited. Horse-racing made their comeback in the 1920s, as state Governments legalized on-track betting as a popular source for state revenue and legalized off-track betting regained its popularity.Riess, \\"The Cyclical History of Horse Racing.\\" The Great Depression saw the legalization of some forms of gambling such as bingo in some cities to allow churches and charities to raise money, but most gambling remained illegal. In the 1930s, 21 states opened race tracks.Schwartz, Cutting The Wire pp 26‚Äì27. =Localities= Some cities such as Miami, the \\"Free State of Galveston in Texas,\\" and Hot Springs, Arkansas, became regional gambling centers, attracting gamblers from more prudish rural areas. New York City At the turn-of-the-century in 1900, gambling was illegal but widespread in New York City. The favorite activities included games of chance such as cards, dice and numbers, and betting on sports events, chiefly horse racing. In the upper class, gambling was handled discreetly in the expensive private clubs, the most famous of which was operated by Richard Canfield, who operated the Saratoga Club. Prominent players included Reggie Vanderbilt and John Bet-a- Million Gates. The chief competitor to Canfield was the \\"Bronze Door,\\" operated 1891‚Äì1917, by a syndicate of gamblers closely linked to the Democratic machine represented by Tammany Hall. These elite establishments were illegal and paid off the police and politicians as needed. The working- class was served by hundreds of neighbourhood gambling parlours, featuring faro card games, and the omnipresent policy shops where poor folks could bet a few pennies on the daily numbers, and be quickly paid off so they could gamble again. Betting on horse racing was allowed only at the tracks themselves, where the controls were tight. The most famous venue was Belmont Park, a complex of five racecourses, a 12,000 seat grandstand, and multiple stables, centred around a lavish clubhouse. Middle-class gamblers could frequent the city's race tracks, but the centre of middle-class moral gravity was strongly opposed to all forms of gambling. The reform movements were strongest in the 1890s. It was led by men such as the Reverend Charles H. Parkhurst, the leading Presbyterian pastor and president of the New York Society for the Prevention of Crime;Warren Sloat, A Battle for the Soul of New York: Tammany Hall, Police Corruption, Vice and Reverend Charles Parkhurst's Crusade Against Them,1892-1895 (2002) review reform mayor William L. Strong, and his police commissioner Theodore Roosevelt. Reformers passed laws in the state legislature against any emerging gambling venue. Such laws were enforced and most of the small towns and rural areas, but not in New York's larger cities, where political machines controlled the police and the courts.Mike Wallace, Greater Gotham: A history of New York City from 1898 to 1919 (Oxford U, 2017), pp 615-618 Another common gambling activity during this period was betting on political elections. Betting on United States presidential elections from around 1868 to 1940 was practiced on a large scale, centered on New York city, which conducted an estimated half of the activity. The money spent on election betting even occasionally exceeded trading done on the stock exchanges of Wall Street. The odds from the betting markets were often used as a way to predict the outcome of an election. Election betting generally declined leading up to the second world war, due to a combination of factors, including increased legal restrictions, being crowded out by horse betting, and the rise of scientific polling like Gallup, which correctly predicted the outcome of the 1940 election. Saratoga Springs After 1870, Saratoga Springs became the nation's top upscale resort relying on natural mineral springs, horse racing, gambling, and luxury hotels. World War II imposed severe travel restrictions which financially ruined the tourist industry. Since 1970, there has been a revival with a renovated racetrack, a 28-day exclusive racing season, a new interstate, winter sports emphasis, and an influx of young professionals.Janet Nyberg Paraschos, \\"Saratoga Springs\\" American Preservation (1978) 2#1 pp 59-72. Cleveland Horse racing has a long history in Cleveland, as elites by the 1860s, worked to keep gamblers and criminals at bay.See \\"Horse Racing\\" Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History The Mayfield Road Mob, based in the Little Italy district, became a powerful local crime syndicate in the 1920s and 1930s, through bootlegging and illegal gambling. Local gangsters worked deals with the Jewish-Cleveland Syndicate, which operated laundries, casinos, and nightclubs. Both groups profited from illegal gambling, bookmaking, loan sharking, and labor rackets in northern Ohio.See \\"Mayfield Rd. Mob Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History The \\"Harvard Club\\" (named after its Harvard street location in the Cleveland suburbs) operated in 1930‚Äì41, as one of the largest gambling operations attracting customers from his far as New York and Chicago. It moved to different locations on Harvard Street, which accommodated 500‚Äì1,000 gamblers who came to shoot craps and to play the slot machines, roulette, and all-night poker. It defied numerous raids until it was finally shut down by Frank Lausche in 1941.\\"Harvard Club\\" Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History online Eliot Ness, after building a crime- fighting national reputation in Chicago, took on Cleveland, 1934‚Äì1942. He tried to suppressed labor-union protection rackets, illegal liquor suppliers, and gambling, but his reputation suffered.See \\"Ness, Eliot\\" Encyclopedia Of Cleveland History =Legalisation in states= The Las Vegas Strip became the nation's casino capital. To overcome the Great Depression, Nevada legalised gambling as a way to bring economic relief. In 1931, Nevada legalised most forms of gambling when Assembly Bill 98 was signed into law, providing a source of revenue for the state. Interest in development in the state was slow at first, as the state itself had a limited population. After 1945, enforcement of gambling laws became more strict in most places and the resort town of Las Vegas became an attractive target for investment by crime figures such as New York's Bugsy Siegel. The town rapidly developed during the 1950s, dooming some illegal gambling venues such as Galveston. Thanks to cheap air travel and auto access from California, Nevada, and Las Vegas, in particular, it became the centre of gambling in the U.S. In the 1960s, Howard Hughes and other legitimate investors purchased many of the most important hotels and casinos in the city, gradually eliminating the city's connections to organizes crime.Nicholas Pileggi, Casino: The Rise and Fall of the Mob in Las Vegas (2001). Southern Maryland became popular for its slot machines which operated legally there between 1949 (1943 in some places) and 1968. In 1977, New Jersey legalized gambling in Atlantic City. The city rapidly grew into a significant tourist destination, briefly revitalising what was previously largely a run- down slum community. In 1979, the Seminole tribe opened the first reservation- based commercial gambling beginning a trend that would be followed by other reservations.Johansen, Bruce. The Praeger Handbook on Contemporary Issues in Native America, Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2007. Gradually, lotteries and some types of parimutuel betting were legalised in other areas of the country. In the 1990s, riverboat casinos were legalised in Louisiana and Illinois in addition to other states. In 1996, Michigan legalised gambling in the city of Detroit, creating an economic centre for potential casino growth. In an attempt to curb the ill effects of the rapid rise in gambling on sporting events, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. This act was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018, because the court deemed it was unconstitutional for the federal government to prohibit states from legalised it under state law. In the early 21st century, Internet gambling grew rapidly in popularity worldwide Global Internet gambling reaching US$34 billion in 2011. This is higher than worldwide movie box office revenues and represents 9% of the international gambling market. However, interstate and international transactions remained illegal under the Federal Wire Act of 1961, with additional penalties added by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.

The fire began when a worker used a blowtorch to warm asphalt shingles that were being applied to a facade. He left before checking that all spots had cooled, and a three-alarm fire broke out. Nine firefighters and a Los Angeles County sheriffs' deputy sustained minor injuries. The fire was completely extinguished after 24 hours. Universal Pictures claimed that the fire destroyed a three-acre () portion of the Universal backlot, including the attraction King Kong Encounter and 40,000 to 50,000 archived digital video and film copies. A 2019 New York Times Magazine expos√© asserted that the fire also destroyed 118,000 to 175,000 audio master tapes belonging to Universal Music Group (UMG). This included original recordings belonging to some of the best-selling artists worldwide. UMG initially disputed the story, but CEO Lucian Grainge later confirmed that there had been a significant loss of musical archives. Fire On June 1, 2008, a three-alarm fire broke out on Universal Studios Lot, the backlot of Universal Studios. The fire started when a worker was using a blowtorch to warm asphalt shingles being applied to a facade. The Los Angeles County Fire Department reported that Brownstone Street, New York Street, New England Street, the King Kong attraction, some structures that make up Courthouse Square, and the Video Vault, which contained duplicates of Universal's film library, had burned down. Aerial news footage captured the Courthouse building surviving its third fire, with only the west side slightly charred. Over 516 firefighters responded, as well as two helicopters dropping water. Nine firefighters and a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy sustained minor injuries. The fire took at least 12 hours to extinguish, in part because of the low water pressure due to the low capacity of Universal's pipes; firefighters had to tap streams and lakes. Universal executives initially claimed the fire destroyed 40,000 to 50,000 archived digital video and film copies of Universal movies and TV shows, some almost a century old, and including the films Knocked Up and Atonement, the NBC series Law & Order, The Office, and Miami Vice, and the CBS series I Love Lucy. Universal president Ron Meyer told the media that \\"nothing irreplaceable was lost\\" and that the company had duplicates of everything destroyed. Several days after the fire, it was reported that the King Kong attraction would be replaced by a new attraction. However, Universal reverted to its original plan, basing the new attraction, King Kong: 360 3-D, on the 2005 King Kong film. 2019 New York Times report In 2019, The New York Times Magazine published an investigative article by music journalist Jody Rosen which disclosed that the damage was far more serious than the studio had claimed. The fire destroyed Building 6197, a warehouse adjoining the King Kong attraction. In addition to more videos, it housed a huge archive of analog audio master tapes belonging to Universal Music Group (UMG). The collection included the master tape catalogues of many labels acquired by UMG, including Chess, Decca, MCA, Geffen, Interscope, A&M;, Impulse!, and their subsidiary labels. Estimates of the individual items lost range from 118,000 to 175,000 album and 45 rpm single master tapes, phonograph master discs, lacquers and acetates, as well as all the documentation contained in the tape boxes. Many tapes contained unreleased recordings such as outtakes, alternative versions of released material, and instrumental \\"submaster\\" multitracks created for dubbing and mixdown. Randy Aronson, manager of the vault at the time, estimates that the masters of as many as 500,000 individual tracks were lost. Among the possible losses were the entire AVI Records catalog, all of Decca's masters from the 1930s to the 1950s, most of the original Chess masters which included artists such as Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, as well as most of John Coltrane's master tapes from his later career on Impulse! Records. On Twitter, Rosen stated that the Coltrane masters were among the most checked-out Impulse! items in the vault, and a source had told him that the masters for A Love Supreme were likely elsewhere during the fire. On June 25, Rosen wrote a follow-up article, listing at least 700 additional artists named in internal UMG documents as possibly affected. Rosen wrote that it was impossible to determine which recordings had been destroyed, or how much of an artist's discography had been affected. For example, Rosen said it was difficult to confirm whether the Neil Young recordings listed in the documents were the original master tapes of the albums he recorded for Geffen Records in the 1980s, or session outtakes from those records. Rosen tweeted that the documents also listed several Broadway cast recordings among the tapes destroyed. Additionally, several non-musical audio recordings were reported as destroyed, including the original recording of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1968 \\"Remaining Awake During a Great Revolution\\" speech. =Artists' responses= Bryan Adams, Semisonic drummer Jacob Slichter, and Counting Crows singer Adam Duritz said they had been told that UMG had misplaced their tapes. Richard Carpenter told the Times he had been informed about the destruction of his tapes by a UMG employee while he was working on a reissue, and only after Carpenter had made multiple, persistent inquiries. Following the publication of Rosen's articles, several affected musicians posted reactions on social media, with some noting specific tapes that may have been lost. For instance, singer-songwriter Jill Sobule said she had lost two masters in the fire, including tapes for an unreleased album produced by Joe Jackson. On June 21, 2019, five plaintiffs‚Äîsinger-songwriter Steve Earle, the estates of the late Tupac Shakur and Tom Petty, and the bands Hole and Soundgarden‚Äîfiled a class action lawsuit in federal court against UMG. In their complaint, the plaintiffs claim UMG never told artists about the effects of the fire and had breached their contracts by failing to properly secure its master tape collection. They further allege that UMG did not share insurance or legal payouts received as a result of the fire. The lawsuit also alleges that Universal had compiled a master inventory list of master tapes that had been destroyed. The plaintiffs seek to recover half of any insurance payments UMG received from the fire, and half of any losses that were not covered by those settlements. An uninvolved industry attorney told Billboard that the case concerned property rights, as in whether UMG or the artists owned the master tapes. On July 17, Universal moved to dismiss the class action lawsuit. On August 16, 2019, Hole dropped out of the class action lawsuit after UMG assured them that the band's masters were not affected by the fire. Slightly over a month later, UMG also claimed that Shakur, Earle, and Petty did not lose their masters in the fire, and that an investigation with Soundgarden was still ongoing. Five days later, Universal demanded Soundgarden drop the suit, which the label had also moved to dismiss, citing documentary proof that the label had informed the band about the lost masters in 2015 and accusing their lawyer of \\"[failing] to conduct pre-suit diligence in your rush to be the first to file.\\" The surviving band members declined. \\"Their arbitrary deadlines have zero force or effect\\", Howard King, their attorney, told Rolling Stone. \\"Until UMG reveals what it collected for their litigation claims to extensive damage to master recordings, we cannot accept their belated claim that no damages were actually suffered.‚Äù Universal's dismissal motion also publicly confirmed that master tapes for Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger album had been destroyed in the fire, and that members of the group had been made aware of the destruction in 2015 while they were working on a remaster of the album that was eventually completed with a backup safety copy. In December 2019, district court judge John Kronstadt ruled that Universal must hand over discovery evidence, and denied the label's request to postpone the delivery. In March 2020, Soundgarden and the Shakur estate dropped out of the class action against UMG. On March 23, Steve Earle also dropped out, leaving Tom Petty's widow as the only remaining plaintiff.https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and- management/9342053/steve-earle-drops-claims-against-universal- music-2008-backlot-fire The lawsuit was dismissed by Kronstadt on April 6, 2020. =UMG response= UMG disputed the New York Times article, saying it contained \\"numerous inaccuracies\\" and \\"fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets\\", but was unable to disclose details due to \\"constraints\\". In a Billboard interview, UMG archivist Patrick Kraus said that several Impulse! Records, John Coltrane, Muddy Waters, Ahmad Jamal, Nashboro Records, and Chess Records masters survived the fire and were still in Universal's archive. Rosen responded in his June 25 piece, noting that some of the masters that Kraus had mentioned may have survived the fire because they were being used for remastering projects at the time, or were not the primary source master. Aronson also confirmed to Rosen that the vast majority of items in the vault at the time of the fire were original, primary source master recordings. In an email to staff following the publication of Rosen's story, Lucian Grainge confirmed that UMG had suffered a serious loss of archival material. Grainge wrote, \\"While I've been somewhat relieved by early reports from our team that many of the assertions and subsequent speculation are not accurate, one thing is clear: the loss of even a single piece of archived material is heartbreaking.\\" He wrote that it was \\"completely unacceptable\\" that their artists did not know the details and pledged to deliver \\"answers\\". On June 26, Kraus issued a memo to staff which detailed UMG's plan to determine which assets had been affected. A month after the story broke, Kraus issued an internal note to Universal staff, which claimed that only 22 original master recordings by five artists were lost in the fire, and backup copies had been found for each lost master. He added that UMG has been fielding requests from over 200 artists and their representatives. Kraus said his team had reviewed over 26,000 assets by 30 artists. From that sample, 424 assets (including 349 audio recordings) might have been lost due to the fire. On November 4, 2019, a lawyer representing Universal claimed the artists would receive no compensation. A February 2020 court filing by UMG confirmed that master tapes from at least 19 artists had been damaged or destroyed in the fire. The artists whom UMG confirmed as affected are: Bryan Adams, And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, David Baerwald, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Peter Frampton, Jimmy Eat World, Elton John, Michael McDonald, Nirvana, Les Paul, R.E.M., Slayer, Sonic Youth, Soundgarden, the Surfaris, Suzanne Vega, White Zombie, and Y&T.; List of artists affected, according to The New York Times According to The New York Times Magazine, artists whose original master recordings were destroyed in whole or part in the 2008 fire include: * 38 Special * 50 Cent * Colonel Abrams * Johnny Ace * Bryan Adams * Nat Adderley * Aerosmith * Rhett Akins * Manny Albam * Lorez Alexandria * Gary Allan * Red Allen * Steve Allen * Ames Brothers * Gene Ammons * Bill Anderson * John Anderson * The Andrews Sisters * Lee Andrews & the Hearts * Paul Anka * Adam Ant * Toni Arden * Joan Armatrading * Louis Armstrong * Asia * Asleep at the Wheel * Audioslave * Patti Austin * Average White Band * Albert Ayler * Hoyt Axton * Burt Bacharach * Joan Baez * Razzy Bailey * Chet Baker * Florence Ballard * Hank Ballard * Gato Barbieri * Baja Marimba Band * The Banana Splits * Len Barry * Count Basie * Fontella Bass * The Beat Farmers * Sidney Bechet * Beck * Captain Beefheart * Archie Bell & the Drells * Vincent Bell * Bell Biv DeVoe * Louie Bellson * David Benoit * George Benson * Berlin * Elmer Bernstein * Chuck Berry * Nuno Bettencourt * Stephen Bishop * Blackstreet * Art Blakey * Hal Blaine * Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland * The Blind Boys of Alabama * Mary J.

Restaurant menus often omit detailed descriptions of a house wine's country of origin, winery or grape varietal, listing it simply as \\"house red\\" or \\"house white\\", depending on the wine's style. Some restaurants offer more specific categories of house wines, such as a \\"house chardonnay\\", or a \\"house merlot\\". Production and sale House wines generally rotate, with restaurants typically transitioning from one kind to another based on availability or season. House wines are typically wines that a restaurant feels will appeal to a large proportion of its clientele, determined either by its past success as a normal entry on the wine list or because the wine is easy to drink and pairs well with a significant amount of menu items. House wines are often bought in bulk by restaurants, enabling the restaurants to further lower their prices. While house wines are still usually offered by the glass, many restaurants also offer them by the carafe or bottle.  Historical trends  Historically, house wine was usually poor quality, possibly \\"jug wine\\" derived from a second pressing of the grapes,Henry Front, \\"Grapes & Grain\\", Orange Coast Magazine (January 1979), p. 95. and sold by the glass, promoted by a restaurant primarily on the basis of the wine's low cost. A 1979 article asserted that \\"so called 'fine' restaurants, those serving the haute cuisine or those considered posh or plush, will not carry a house wine\\". In the 21st century, due to a general rise in the availability of high quality wine, house wines have improved in quality in restaurants in the United States, and frequently may be produced by or for a specific restaurant, although house wines will still usually be on the cheaper end of the wine list for any given restaurant.

It is the sequel to the 1985 Family Computer game Star Luster, which was Namco's first original game for home consoles. In the game, the player controls one of seven ships in their mission to wipe out an alien race threatening the galaxy. Gameplay revolves around clearing missions to progress further, such as destroying a certain fleet of enemies or protecting a space station from enemy fire. The game is part of the fictional United Galaxy Space Force universe, which combines many earlier Namco games into a flowing timeline. Much of the game's playable ships and enemies are based on those from other Namco games such as Galaga and Bosconian. Upon release, Star Ixiom received mixed reviews - while many applauded its visuals and controls, it was criticized for its simplicity and lack of variety in missions, with several outlets unfavorably comparing it to Colony Wars. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing the player shooting down an enemy. Star Ixiom is a space combat simulator video game. The player selects one of seven different star ships, each equipped with different weapons and abilities, to fight off an alien race known as the ‚ÄúUnknown Intelligent Mechanized Species‚Äù (UIMS) and other extraterrestrial races.Star Ixiom instruction manual. Namco Ltd. Retrieved 9 September 1999. The player is given the option to select one of seven star ships, each based on other Namco video games - these include the GAIA from the original Star Luster, the Galaxip from Galaxian, and the Geosword from Starblade. Each craft has their own unique weapon load outs and abilities, such as a faster firing rate or movement speed. The player can also switch between a first and third-person view. The game is split across three different game modes - \\"Training\\", which helps the player learn the controls and in-game mechanics, \\"Command\\", an upgraded Training mode with more enemy formations, and \\"Conquest\\", the main focus that adds missions. Missions include destroying a fleet of enemies or protecting a base from being wiped out. All three game modes will allow the player to access a map screen, displaying the placement of enemies, bases and the player's current location - the player can select any of these locations to immediately warp there. Like the original Star Luster, the player has a limited amount of energy, which will drain as the player fires at enemies and warps to other locations. Fuel can be fully replenished by traveling to space stations found throughout the game. Once the meter fully drains, the game will be over and the player will need to continue from their last save point. In the Conquest mode, the player can acquire items and upgrades for their ship by completing missions, which can increase the strength of the ship, firing rate, or give them access to a new weapon, including a tractor beam from Gaplus. Development and release The graphical style of Star Ixiom is based on the one found in the Sharp X68000 version of Star Luster. Star Ixiom was directed by Yuichiro Sadahiro, known for his work on the Tales series and Katamari Damacy. It is the sequel to Star Luster, an older Namco game released for the Family Computer in 1985 that has since been ported to several other platforms. The game was billed as a \\"simulation and shooting\\" title, meant to signify the usage of elements from both tactical role-playing games and space combat simulations. It is set within Namco's United Galaxy Space Force (UGSF) saga, a fictional universe that ties together many of their space shooting games into one cohesive timeline. The development team focused on modernizing the gameplay in Star Luster while still keeping the mechanics and ideas that made the original popular intact. Its graphical style was designed after the one used in both the Sharp X68000 conversion of Star Luster and the PlayStation game Starblade Alpha. Characters and starships from the Xevious series were intended to appear in the game, but were cut at the last minute. The fictional word \\"Ixiom\\" in the game's title means \\"eternal truth\\". Namco announced Star Ixiom in January 1999; no comment was made on an international release. It was presented at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show in March, alongside Namco's own Dragon Valor and Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere. The game was released in Japan on September 9, 1999. A European release followed a year later. Famitsu released a guidebook to coincide with its release, detailing its world, gameplay and characters. A soundtrack album, Star Ixiom/Original Soundtrack, was released on December 18, 1999. Reception Star Ixiom received a mixed reception, with many criticizing its simplicity and lack of variety in missions. German magazine Video Games labeled its presentation ‚Äúextremely boring‚Äù, although would complement its simplistic controls, while Mega Fun disliked its lack of variety and bland storyline, unfavorable comparing it to Colony Wars. Swedish publication Super PLAY stated the game was too easy, only recommending it to players overwhelmed with games like Colony Wars. In a more positive light, Next Generation highly praised its graphics and atmosphere, stating they ‚Äúoffer a convincing illusion of speed and scale‚Äù, while also applauding its depth and innovation. They also complimented its multiple game modes and ease of access to newer players. Consoles Plus, while calling it a ‚Äúless serious‚Äù game than Colony Wars, appreciated the game's presentation and originality, alongside its role-playing game elements and cinematic cutscenes.

During an ongoing pep rally at the high school, Christian, a new student, spots Roxanne and asks about her, while Cyrus hacks into the school system and disgraces a football jock sending a nude picture to Roxanne. Cyrus is later caught and is given detention in the computer lab. Brownie confronts him about telling Roxy, his longtime crush, how he feels, but Cyrus is insistent on not letting her know how he feels because of his nose. Brownie advises him not to worry about his nose since no one else cares. However, even if he tries to hide behind his bold exterior, Cyrus feels self- conscious about his nose and cares a great deal what other people think. Roxy calls almost immediately and thanks Cyrus for what he did, then asks that they meet up the next day. She says she wants to tell him something super important.

Authorities suspect he was not from Alberta, but most likely worked as a migrant worker.  Discovery  Sam was found wearing a blue Levi shirt with snap buttons, a gray t-shirt, blue jeans, and imitation Wallabee shoes. His decomposed body was wrapped in a yellow bed sheet and tied up with a nylon rope. Sam was found by a local couple scavenging their abandoned property for a septic tank pump. After seeing his leg bobbing in their old septic tank, they alerted the Tofield Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment. Two officers came to the scene to recover Sam's body, where they spent an hour emptying the 1.8 meter deep septic tank with empty ice cream pails. = Autopsy = A medical examiner in Edmonton determined Sam to be of European Canadian descent. His bones and teeth suggested he suffered from an unspecified illness at five years old. Sam's cause of death was two gunshots to the head and chest, although it was possible there could have been more if any of the bullets did not reach his skeleton. Before his death, Sam had been tortured; he had been beaten, tied up, burned with a small butane torch and cigarettes, and sexually mutilated with farm shears. The sexual mutilation was so severe that the medical examiner took several months to positively identify him as a male. Based on the burn marks on his shirt sleeves, Sam could have been tied to a bed while tortured. After Sam's death, he had been covered in quicklime, most likely in an attempt to quicken decomposition.  Investigation  Due to a lack of evidence in the septic tank, Sam was most likely murdered elsewhere and the septic tank was only a dumpsite. Sam's murderers are believed to have known him, due to how viciously he had been killed. It is also suspected Sam's murderers were Tofield locals or were familiar with the area, due to the location of Sam's dumpsite being on a rural property. Sam's body has been exhumed from his unmarked grave in an Edmonton cemetery twice. In 1979, Sam's remains were flown out to Clyde Snow and Betty Gatliff, Forensic anthropologist and medical illustrator at the Federal Aviation Administration in Oklahoma who had been creating 3D facial composites from skulls since 1967. Along with creating a facial composite for Sam, the two could tell by measuring his hands that he was right-handed. Snow believed Sam to be of Indigenous origin and around 35 years old, contradicting the RCMP's belief of Sam being a European Canadian and between 26 and 32. Sam was exhumed and reconstructed for the second time in 2000 by Cyril Chan, who was with the Edmonton medical examiner's office at the time. = Aftermath = The 1,200 residents of Tofield at the time were horrified to hear of Sam's murder. Farmers checked their own septic tanks for bodies and business owners worried that Sam's murderers could have been regular customers. Many speculated Sam had been sexually mutilated due to committing a sex crime or being unfaithful in a relationship. Ed Lammerts, one of the officers who helped recover Sam's body, has since retired. He believes Sam will never be identified, despite sending X-rays of Sam's teeth to 800 Albertan dentists coupled with publishing them in dental magazines, and spending $1,000,000 CAD on the case.

The passport can be used to verify nationality and identity, and is issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Citizenship of South Korea is granted to qualifying individuals under the South Korean Nationality Act and its fifteen amendments. Citizenship status reflects the rights, duties, and identity of individuals in relation to the South Korean state. There are elements of the jus sanguinis principle of citizenship acquisition in South Korean nationality law, as citizenship inheritance is possible for those with a blood relationship to ethnic Koreans. However, the stringency of this standard has been complicated by politics, the effects of globalization, as well as historical patterns of migration. Maintaining the balance between the supposed homogeneity of South Korean society and the discourse of progress has proven somewhat tenuous. Despite this, the pliability of citizenship policies in recent years seems to indicate a larger trend that welcomes the addition of select foreigners. The unique history of Korea, including its division and colonization, have impacted the context in which citizenship is interpreted. Because of this, the year that the South Korean state was established has figured prominently in determining the legitimacy of South Korean nationality, as there was no such thing until 1948. South Korean identity has been formed in reaction to violence and occupation, and the legislative approach to determining who is worthy of belonging has reflected this. Those who are included and excluded from the benefits of citizenship reflect not just the relations between people living in South Korea, but also the South Korean state's relationship to outsiders more broadly.  Terminology  Citizens, or members of the South Korean state, are often referred to through the discourse of kungmin. This term was inherited by Koreans from the Japanese, whose concept of kokumin is a translation of the German staatsvolk. Kokumin is characterized by philosophies of loyalty to the state and its leader as opposed to sovereignty over a state by an ethnic group (as in the German staatsvolk). Because of its etymological roots, there has been a persistent tension between notions of duty and rights for kungmin. Citizenship (siminkwon) and nationality (kukchok) may be referred to interchangeably in the South Korean context due to a blurriness between these concepts both in legislation and culture.  History  = 1948-1997: Post-Republic of Korea = From the point that the South Korean state was established in 1948 until the late 1990s, the primary means of acquiring South Korean citizenship was based on paternal lineage‚Äîany child born to a Korean father was granted citizenship. This tradition is based on the principle of jus sanguinis a patre. In 1997, the Republic of Korea Nationality Law Amendment extended the qualifications for Korean citizenship so that any child born to a Korean parent may acquire South Korean nationality at birth, regardless of the parent's sex. This amendment sought to address the problem of gender inequality in the previous Nationality Law, a concession that the Kim Young- Sam administration planned to reach parity with international standards and bolster transnational relations. Following the allowance of non-gendered citizenship inheritance from parents, new barriers were put in place in the aim of limiting foreigners‚Äô acquisition of South Korean citizenship. Naturalization through marriage, which was once granted automatically to foreign wives of Korean men, was given stricter criteria. Through an additional amendment to the Nationality Law in 1997, applicants for naturalization on the basis of marriage to a South Korean citizen would first need to establish residency for two years. = 1998-2007: Reactions to expanding citizenship = Between 1998 and 2004, there were a series of limitations put on citizenship rights and naturalization in an effort to allay public opinion regarding the many privileges of South Korean citizenship afforded to overseas Koreans and other foreigners. In 2005, Military Service Law was extended to require service by all male citizens, regardless of whether they were permanent residents in another country. To be released from military obligation, Korean men were required to renounce their South Korean citizenship. However, many concessions have since been made in service of advancing the economic interests of South Korea. In 2007, legislation was introduced to allow high-skilled foreigners to obtain D-10 visas. Prior to this, foreigners were required to secure employment in South Korea to be deemed eligible for a visa. = 2010-2018: The contemporary global era = In 2010, a new amendment offered South Korean citizenship to talented foreigners, regardless of ethnic background, without the residency requirements for those seeking naturalization through marriage. Similarly, between 2011 and 2016, several amendments were made that would allow South Korean citizens to maintain multiple citizenships‚Äìa dispensation which was expressly prohibited in the years prior. Despite the absence of ethnic requirements in recent nationality law amendments, opportunities for flexible citizenship tend to attract affluent and highly educated foreigners and Korean Americans. Those seeking naturalization through marriage tend to be women and ethnic minorities. In this way, eligibility for South Korean citizenship remains fraught along ethnic, gender, and class lines. Because international standards for human rights directly impact domestic politics, the political practicality of offering citizenship rights to migrants is growing steadily. Advocacy groups representing the interests of undocumented people continue to push for the protection and dignity of migrants under the state. However, this sentiment is not universal as nativism is on the rise in South Korea‚Äìthis has been attributed to the erosion of citizens' rights in the name of market fundamentalism.  Nationality Law  The Constitution of South Korea entrusts the National Assembly with the responsibility of establishing laws which govern citizenship. The Nationality Act of 1948 was the first piece of legislation enacted by the National Assembly which established the boundaries for acquisition of South Korean citizenship. Since its enactment, the Nationality Act has since been amended fifteen times. = Act on Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Koreans of 1999 = In 1999, the Act on Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Koreans officially established the relationship of overseas Koreans (chaeoe tongp‚Äôo) to the South Korean State in legal terms. This law virtually granted dual citizenship rights‚Äîto work, to stay in the country for a prolonged period, to own property‚Äîto certain groups of diasporic Koreans, such as those residing in Japan and Korean Americans. While this Act appears to indicate an openness to the inclusion of overseas Koreans generally, over fifty percent of this population was initially excluded from receiving the benefits of South Korean citizenship. This was due to criteria in the law which deemed the nationalities of many Korean Chinese and Korean Russians unverifiable. The heritage and identities of those whose ancestors migrated away from Korea prior to the establishment of the South Korean state in 1948 were regarded as particularly precarious. The provision in the original version of this law which excluded some overseas Koreans was considered controversial both in South Korea and around the world, which resulted in the Constitutional Court ordering the revision of the act in accordance with the ‚Äúequality principle‚Äù of the South Korean Constitution. Of course, even as problematic verbiage in the Overseas Korean Act was discarded in 2004, there remain practical issues associated with this law that continue to limit certain overseas Koreans‚Äô South Korean citizenship rights.  Controversies  Scholars have argued that citizenship is not a fixed status that can be achieved, but rather an ongoing project that changes over time. Because of this tension between notions of stability and fluidity, the concept of citizenship is a site of struggle. South Korea's struggles with recognizing and classifying who should qualify for citizenship reflect both the plasticity of national identities and geographical boundaries. Because exclusivity and exclusion are inherently tied to notions of citizenship, this means that not only are migrants shaped by their reception in a new polity, but citizens too are shaped by determinations of belonging. To this extent, citizens and non- citizens are thought to be formed through a mutually constitutive process in reaction to the policies of the state.

Gameplay has players exploring dungeon areas selected from a world map, fighting enemies in real-time combat with spirit weapons called Daemons while shifting between the world of the living and an afterlife referred to as the \\"Beyond\\". Oninaki is set in a world where the doctrine of reincarnation is enforced by figures called Watchers, who assist in the passing of souls and fight monsters born of regret. The player controls the Watcher Kagachi as he confronts a shrouded figure called the Night Devil. As his journey continues, Kagachi uncovers hidden truths surrounding the cycle of reincarnation and his own past life. Concept work began in 2016 during the last stages of Lost Sphears development. Takashi Tokita, noted for his work on Chrono Trigger, came on board as a creative producer and pushed writer Hirotaka Inaba's story in a darker direction than his earlier work. The gameplay and graphics were also changed, becoming more action-focused and cinematic. The music was composed by Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Mariam Abounnasr of Procyon Studio. The game has received mixed reviews from critics upon release, with praise going to its mature setting and art design, though several criticised its story delivery and gameplay. Gameplay alt=A three quarters view from overhead of a combat scene between the protagonist and several enemies. There is a radar map in the lower right, a percentage gauge in the lower left, and in the upper left a health bar as well as a level indicator. The enemies are in shades of black, the surroundings are in shades of earthy brown, and the heroes blade glows blue, having just caused a burst of neon blue light, indicating an attack has just occurred. Oninaki is an action role-playing game where players take on the role of the Watcher Kagachi, who battles monsters called the Fallen while exploring the game world through two planes; the Living World and the afterlife world known as the \\"Beyond\\". Players view environments from an isometric angle, with Kagachi exploring dungeon environments completing both story-based and optional quests. Standard enemies roam the dungeon environments, attacking Kagachi on sight, while many areas end with a boss encounter. During exploration and combat, Kagachi can find Healing Salves which restore health, upgrade artifacts, and grant new weapons. During combat in the Beyond, Kagachi gives and takes more damage. In the Beyond, the environment shifts, allowing for new routes to open or allowing access to teleport points for travelling between different areas. Players must explore both worlds in order to progress through the game, with areas that must be first explored in the world of the living, otherwise Kagachi must navigate a black void in the Beyond and can be killed in one hit by enemies. By defeating Fallen, Kagachi earns experience points which raise his basic statistics. Kagachi battles the Fallen using Daemons, spirits manifesting as weapons. Starting off with a basic sword Daemon, Kagachi gains more Daemons as the story progresses. Each Daemon comes with a different weapon type, such as scythes, axes and spears. Daemons have different weapon-based skills, mapped to four different control buttons, each with a cooldown timer after use. Using a Daemon increases an affinity meter; reaching 100% raises Kagachi's attack power, while going above 150% begins decreasing his defence. When at 100% and above, Kagachi can trigger an empowered state. Using a Daemon in combat earns Soul Stones which unlock that Daemon's skill tree; unlocks include new combat abilities which are equipped to three of the four buttons, stat increases, and small cutscenes related to the Daemon's narrative. Using skills repeatedly unlocks bonuses for that attack. New weapons found during exploration and combat can be equipped to Daemons, with these weapons having slots for upgrade gems, which increase weapons stats. Synopsis Kagachi is a Watcher, a person charged with defending the Cycle of Reincarnation, killing monsters formed from regret with spirit weapons called Daemons and helping spirits pass into their next life by any means necessary. Kagachi works closely with both Kushi, his adopted father, and Mayura, Kushi‚Äôs daughter, operating from the world's only city Szaka. In the aftermath of a mission against a cult rebelling against the Cycle of Reincarnation, Kagachi meets a girl who does not remember who she is, and so he names her Linne. She is being hunted by the Night Devil, a powerful spirit who hounds Kagachi and gives aid to the cult in undermining the current monarch Lobelia. Lobelia and her son Leo instruct the Watchers to focus on destroying the cult over their other duties, causing friction within the Watchers. During one mission against the cult, Mayura is killed and Kagachi helps free her spirit. The Night Devil confronts Kagachi several times, possessing Watchers with his hatred and eventually using Kushi as his host. Kushi incites a rebellion, with the people demanding spiritual equality with the elite surrounding Lobelia. Kagachi tries to reason with the mob, but they attack and force him to kill them. As Kagachi confronts Lobelia, Kushi appears and reveals that Lobelia usurped the throne after having the last true sovereign Sara executed. Kushi attacks, but Leo protects Lobelia at the cost of his life. Kagachi then defeats Kushi, learning as he dies that the Night Devil is a Daemon filled with hatred that wants to end the world. Lobelia further reveals that the true sovereign was key to preserving the world, and a terrible force has been preparing itself since she ended the bloodline. Kagachi finds the Night Devil: Kagachi then learns that the Night Devil is a fragment of Kagachi from a previous life when Kagachi was named Soju, the banished brother of the true sovereign. After defeating the Night Devil and absorbing him, Kagachi kills himself to quell his hatred. Linne, transforming into an adult form, prays for Kagachi to make a new future as a monster emerges from underground to destroy the world. Awakening as Soju in the past, Kagachi pieces together his history; raised by an assassin's guild, Soju acted as a precursor to the Watchers as he carried out the last wishes of lingering spirits. After one such mission, he was killed. Meeting Sara, he realises that \\"Linne\\" was her spirit. Sara explains that the sovereign must keep the Oni, a manifestation of the despair humans discard during reincarnation, from awakening; the monster seen awakening in Kagachi's last life was the Oni. They go to the First Pillar, an ancient magical landmark, and view murals of humans defeating the Oni and Sara's ancestress establishing Szaka, with the Oni sleeping under it. Journeying into the palace and entering the pool of despair at its heart, Kagachi experiences the hopes of those who fought the Oni in ancient times as he escapes; during this time he sees Szaka, called here the Wailing Land where the Oni sleeps. The Oni is revealed to have created the Cycle of Reincarnation to nourish itself with despair, heralded and nurtured by a human avatar called the Oni Priestess; with each awakening and defeat, the Oni destroyed a little more of the world, until only a portion of it remains. Its next awakening will destroy the world, also leading to the Oni's demise without humans to feed it. Kagachi confronts Sara, the current Oni Priestess, and she asks him to decide the world's fate. Kagachi can choose to accept the Oni's awakening and the world's end, or fight Sara. Defeating Sara, he then destroys the awakened Oni. Kagachi then chooses to either kill himself or watch over the world from the Beyond. Development Discussions and concept work for Oninaki began in 2017, during the last stages of development for Lost Sphear. Oninaki was the last of three titles conceptually planned by Tokyo RPG Factory when it was founded to work on I Am Setsuna (2016). The basic plan was for a game built on the resources of the previous two games. A notable addition to the staff was Takashi Tokita, who had gained fame for his work on Chrono Trigger, Live A Live and Parasite Eve. Having previously provided creative input for the battle systems of its earlier titles, Tokita decided that this time he wanted a deeper creative role. Tokita was a general overseer for the project as creative producer, as well as helping create the basic world view and scenario. Main producer Ryutaro Sasaki, who had a supporting role in the company's earlier titles, supervised the gameplay and technical side of production. Atsushi Hashimoto returned as director from Lost Sphear and I Am Setsuna, as did scenario writer Hirotaka Inaba. Tokita's aim for the narrative was to return to his long-held principles of using games to tell a narrative only games could tell, as well as pushing narrative boundaries in terms of theme and tone. One of the things Tokita pushed for was breaking away from the convention that Square Enix role-playing games had to fit within a certain age range. While Inaba was worried, Tokita encouraged him to include far more mature or disturbing content than either Lost Sphear or I Am Setsuna. The game's main motif was life and death, drawing inspiration from many Eastern philosophies that incorporated the concept of reincarnation. The team wanted players to see the story and revisit their own views on the subject. The team crafted the narrative so it would disturb people who experienced it. While the story was dark, the team wanted players to feel rather than see it, so there was no gore or graphic violence and many of the \\"shocking\\" moments are implied rather than shown. Despite the story's dark tones, the team actively worked to avoid a high age recommendation that would bar younger players. The Daemons' backstories helped communicate the narrative's somber tone. The world's faith and its related imagery drew from real-world rituals for the dead such as the Bon Festival. Following the globe- spanning adventure of Lost Sphear, Inaba wanted to write a story on a small scale similar to Vagrant Story. In the game's Japanese release, multiple linguistic writing systems were employed, including kanji, hiragana, and katakana. This mixed use of writing styles was well received in early game concepts as certain scripts are considered more evocative and descriptive than others in Japan. This innovative approach to game writing was retained in the Japanese release. The game's Japanese title, Oni no Naku Kuni, emerged during early discussions about potential titles. A key influence was the concept of \\"demon\\", which was present from an early stage. Once the concept and title were decided, the scenario writing proceeded quickly. Its title translates directly from Japanese as \\"Country Where the Ogre Cries\\". Kagachi's name had several meanings; the word is an alternative word for the Hozuki flower used during the Bon Festival, a homonym for \\"snake\\" which is a common symbol of reincarnation, and when written a certain way included the character for \\"Oni\\". All of these tied into the game's themes. The game's earliest concepts included the continued use of the turn-based combat system, with Kagachi fighting alone to protect the young Linne. Tokita wanted the studio's games pushing for reinvention, something he compared to the drastic gameplay changes between Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II, which later led to the SaGa series. There was internal opposition to the change at first, but Hashimoto brought the staff round to the idea. Hashimoto was also exhausted with the turn-based system. Hashimoto wanted the ability for Kagachi to switch jobs, a term referring to schools of skills characters can learn such as magician or warrior. Hashimoto also wanted the character to be able to switch between jobs in real-time, which contributed to the shift from turn-based to action-based gameplay. The shift between the real world and the Beyond started as a joke about moving between the worlds of I Am Setsuna and Lost Sphear, but eventually became one of the founding elements of Oninaki. The game's dualistic story themes were derived from this style of shifting gameplay. Sasaki was initially aiming for a 20-hour experience, but Tokita pushed for a longer campaign, so it was eventually extended to past 30 hours. The Daemon system, compared by Hashimoto to the job system of Final Fantasy V, was designed so players would not end up hitting roadblocks because some boss enemies were weak to job types the player had not focused on. A notable Daemon cut during development was a human-monster hybrid who used tarot cards in combat. The weapon drop system was inspired by item drops in Kid Icarus: Uprising, a game on which Hashimoto worked. An important element was keeping the gameplay accessible to casual players. alt=The front of a Shinto Shrine, colored gold and brown, with a golden overhang to the front doors. There are carvings both above and to the sides of the main doors. The sky is overcast and dark. While earlier Tokyo RPG Studio titles had used their graphics to evoke nostalgia, the team opted to use those same graphics to create an original worldview. The artistic style of the game blended Western photorealism with a stylised appearance drawn from traditional Japanese paintings. The character designs and key visuals were drawn by Japanese artist Taiki. Hashimoto credited Taiki's designs with reinforcing the unique art style of the world. A number of other artists contributed to the project. Background designer Oga Takeshi drew from several Eastern cities when creating Ehir Palace and the world's capital Szaka. Several monuments drew specifically from Buddhist and Shinto shrine designs. The game's monsters, designed by Morinaga Koji, were based on the concept of them once being normal humans. One design was based on a recurring monster type used in previous Tokyo RPG Factory games. The Japanese calligraphic logo was designed by Tomonori Kogawa, noted for his work on Space Runaway Ideon and Aura Battler Dunbine. Tokita asked for Kogawa based on his skill at brushwork. Kogawa was surprised by the request, but agreed to design the logo. While he was asked to write out words, the final product was compared by Tokita to a full illustration. Since its foundation, Tokyo RPG Factory had drawn inspiration from the Japanese phrase Setsugekka (Snow Moon Flowers) when choosing the visual themes for each planned game; I Am Setsuna used snow, Lost Sphear used the moon, and for Oninaki the team used flowers as the main visual motif. =Music= The music was composed and arranged by Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Mariam Abounnasr of Procyon Studio. Both Tsuchiya and Abounnasr were notable for their work on Another Eden. Tsuchiya wrote the main theme \\"Oninaki\\" based around the game's theme of reincarnation. Abounnasr adapted the main theme several times as a leitmotif, incorporating it into the themes \\"Sadness\\" and \\"Kagachi\\", and also into battle themes. A later musical motive, used in the track \\"Blood Flow\\", had to be used with caution as it potentially spoiled a key plot detail. \\"Oninaki\\" portrayed the surface reality, while \\"Blood Flow\\" was written as an alternate main theme and symbolised its hidden truths. This contrast was compared to that between the main theme of Star Wars as the motif of the villain Darth Vader. The area themes were difficult to write for Tsuchiya, as they only played when first entering a region and never repeated, a rare approach in RPGs. They also adopted an atmospheric musical style more common in Western games and media, watching Discovery Channel documentaries to see how the music was used to reinforce what happened on-screen. Tsuchiya wrote Linne's titular theme first around sadness, then as he got to know her better later in development incorporated hopeful elements into the piece. Sara's theme was originally going to use Linne's musical motif, but the team decided it was not working so she instead incorporated elements of \\"Blood Flow\\". A soundtrack album was released on September 11, 2019 in Japan, published by Square Enix's music label. The album won in the \\"Best Album ‚Äî Soundtrack CD\\" category during Video Game Music Online's 2019 music awards. Release The game was first announced in February 2019 for a Q2/Q3 release the same year in North America, Europe, and Japan for the Nintendo Switch, the PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Windows. The date was eventually announced as August 22; the date was first confirmed for Japan, then as its worldwide release. It was principally released as a digital exclusive, with the Japanese edition coming with several store-exclusive pre-order bonuses. A limited physical release for Switch and PS4 was also produced as a Square Enix store exclusive. While it received a CERO B rating (appropriate for ages twelve and up) in Japan due to a lack of bloody violence, other regions gave it higher ratings due to its dark themes and storyline. A complete guide was released alongside the game in Japan, including full walkthrough instructions and a short story written by Inaba which retold the game's events from the perspective of side characters. This was planned for the main scenario, but clashed with the narrative flow and so was reworked in a written story. The simultaneous release was challenging for the team, creating a pressure that Tokita compared to the hardware limitations he had to face when Chrono Trigger and Parasite Eve were being developed. The script was localized by Alexander O. Smith and a team from his translation company Kajiya Productions. Many of the localized terms were chosen as they were the closest English parallel to the concepts, although staff felt the Japanese names may have given different impressions when directly translated. The marketing staff thought the Japanese title Oni no Naku Kuni would be too long and complex for many Western players to remember. Giving themselves a four-syllable limit, the team created the title Oninaki. A demo of the game, featuring the opening hour of its story and a mid-game dungeon area, was released in July 2019. Players could carry over their saved story progress into the main game. While the demo was released too close to the full game's launch for any substantial changes, the team did make minor adjustments based on feedback from players. These included control fixes and toning down Kagachi's vocalizations during attacks. Reception Reviewers for Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu were generally positive, with their main complaints being complex terminology, stiff character movement, and inventory limitations. Eurogamers Malindy Hetfeld found several concepts worth exploring, but said the game \\"comes across as loveless\\" due to other areas appearing lackluster in execution. Joe Juba, writing for Game Informer, enjoyed playing through Oninaki while citing several elements that undermined the experience for him. T.J. Hafer of IGN called Oninaki a \\"a gorgeous, distinctive, entertaining RPG\\", with his only negative views being on combat pace and the story delivery. Despite mixed reviews, the game was nominated for \\"Game, Original Role Playing\\" at the NAVGTR Awards. Heidi Kemps of GameSpot was particularly negative, focusing on the slow pace and clunky mechanics in the gameplay and a lack of energy in the narrative. By contrast, Nintendo World Reports Jordan Rudek gave it a positive review, praising the developers for their efforts and lauding its themes and mechanics despite disliking the ending and noting pacing issues. Mitch Vogel, writing for Nintendo Life, shared several opinions with Hafer and citing Oninaki as a sign of Tokyo RPG Factory's maturation in game design and quality. RPGFans Alana Hagues was disappointed with the game overall due to its gameplay shortfalls and narrative, a feeling magnified by her wish to enjoy her time. Journalists generally agreed that the game's dark setting and theme of how people coped with death was intriguing, but faulted the writing as either long-winded or poor. The gameplay met with a mixed response; some praised it, others found it boring, but a common complaint was a lack of variety over the course of the game. The Daemon system and its customization were praised, but many felt it lacked depth and several Daemons were underwhelming. The graphics and music, despite a few critics citing a lack of variety in the former and sparse use for the latter, were generally praised as strong points. A general consensus was that the game features strong ideas, but suffered from poor execution and a lack of polish.

Mainland China resumed using its own ships to carry out sea transportation and shipping between its north and south ports. In 1949, after the cross-strait split and the PRC participating in the Korean war, the ROC with support of the US government began military blockades of the Taiwan strait. This was part of the Guanbi policy. The PRC, unable to launch a military counterattack, could only hire foreign ships to carry out shipping, thus disrupting the shipping of its own ships between the northern and southern ports on the Chinese mainland. In May 1966, premier Zhou Enlai of the State council approved the report of the Ministry of Communications on opening the North-South route. On 25 April 1968, the Liming (ÈªéÊòéËΩÆ, The Dawn) made the following voyage: [add image / map] # It first sailed south from Guangdong Zhanjiang, entering the Sulu sea from the Balabac strait. # It entered the Pacific Ocean along the northern coast of Mindanao through the Surigao strait, San Bernardino strait # It then turned northeast towards the Japanese coast and entered the East China Sea through the Dayu strait. # On 8 May the Liming arrived Qingdao port, traveling 4533 nautical miles. # Between June 2‚Äì14, it made its return to Zhanjiang via the reverse route. From September 22 to October 4, the Jiujiang (‰πùÊ±ü, Ninth river), belonging to the Guangdong Ocean shipping company took the same route. On October 22, Zhou Enlai officially approved the opening of the North-South route. In February 1972 Nixon visited China, signaling a d√©tente in US-China relations. In October, the Wuzhishan () sailed from Hainan Basuo port () to the Dalian port, greatly shortening the North-South route. In July 1974, the Yangmingshan () sailed from Zhanjiang port to Qingdao, shortening the route even further. However, because mainland ships cannot typically pass through the Taiwan strait, the South-North route for a long time had to detour around the Pacific. Only in 1979 did shipping resume across the Taiwan strait.

He also played first-grade rugby league for North Sydney. Biography Born in the Whitsundays town of Collinsville, Lowth played club rugby for Brisbane-based club GPS. In 1953, Lowth and a GPS teammate appeared under assumed names for the American All-Stars, a touring rugby league team for the United States. When Queensland rugby officials found out he was banned and subsequently moved to Melbourne. While in Melbourne, Lowth continued to play rugby union and became a Victorian state representative. During this time he also trialled with Australian rules football club Richmond. By 1957 he had moved to Sydney, where he played rugby union for Manly. He attempted to compete in trials that year for the national team but was deemed to be ineligible after being recognised by Australian Rugby Union chairman Tom McCormack while playing in Sydney. The ban was eventually revoked and in 1958 he toured New Zealand and featured in the first Bledisloe Cup test match in Wellington, as a replacement flanker for John Thornett. In the 1960 NSWRFL season he made four first-grade rugby league appearances for North Sydney, playing as a second-row forward.

This has caused an increase in deportation from South Korea as many foreign undocumented workers, specifically migrant workers, in South Korea are the most vulnerable to deportations. Reasons The lack of economic stability plays a factor in whether foreign workers are deported as evidenced with the 1997 Asian financial crisis.Asian Migration Policy: South, Southeast and East Asia. Edited by Md. Mizanur Rahman and Akm Ahsan Ullah. If certain conditions are not met under the Employment Permit System, then the foreign worker would be considered illegal. In addition, the following reasons are for one to get deported: terrorist allegations, supporting or praising North Korea, and not having legal status in South Korea.\\"American set to be deported from South Korea for pro-North views.\\" Retrieved 11 May 2019.Legal Reform in South Korea. Edited by Tom Ginsburg. In January 2015, Korean-American Shin Eun-mi was deported to California due to praising North Korea's wine, leading many conservatives to accuse her of siding with North Korea. Consequences Migrant workers in South Korea do not receive any sort of payment if they have a deportation order. Even if an employer owes them a certain amount of money, that employer is not forced under South Korean law to pay them. Migrant workers =Migrant trade unions= Migrant trade unions are organizations that band migrant workers to fight against wage inequality and discrimination in the workplace. In 2008, Migrant Trade Union leaders Torna Limbu and Abdus Sabur were deported for unspecified actions. Outside forces appealed the deportation, but the South Korean government deported the leaders before anything could be done.

It elected representatives to Cardiff Town Council, Cardiff County Borough Council and the post-1974 Cardiff City Council. The ward ceased to exist in 1983. Description and background A \\"South\\" ward was created (one of four) in Cardiff at the end of the eighteenth century, to elect constables for the town. Two wards, \\"North\\" and \\"South\\", elected councillors to the first Cardiff Borough Council, on 31 December 1835. (the wards would have related to the town's two parishes, of St John's and St Mary's). Before the electoral reforms of the 20th century, councillors were elected by burgesses i.e. ratepaying property owners in the ward. The South ward covered the southern part of Cardiff, including Butetown and Cardiff Docks. When the new ward boundaries for the County Borough Council were being agreed in 1890, it was proposed the ward was renamed \\"Exchange\\", after the Exchange Building in the heart of the business district. However, this was rejected and the name \\"South\\" retained. After 1890 the ward was bordered to the north by the Great Western Railway line (and the Central ward), to the east by the Bute West Dock (and the Adamsdown ward), to the west was the River Taff (and Grangetown). After World War II the ward was altered to include the southern part of Grangetown. Cardiff City Council 1973-1983 In 1973 elections were held for the new Cardiff City Council district authority. The South ward elected three councillors to the authority, in 1973, 1976 and 1979, before ward boundary (and name) changes brought the South ward's existence to an end in 1983. The South ward elected three councillors, all Labour. In 1983, two of the South councillors, Bowen and Smith, were elected as councillors in the neighbouring Grangetown ward. Cardiff South was the comparable ward to South Glamorgan County Council between 1973 and 1985. In 1985 Cardiff South's councillor, Peter Perkins, was elected to represent the new ward of The Marl. Both the South and Cardiff South wards were represented by Labour Party councillors. Cllr Philip Dunleavy, who led Cardiff City Council during the 1970s, was a representative for both wards. South was replaced by the Butetown ward. Cardiff County Borough Council 1889-1974 Wards of Cardiff, 1890 In July 1890, following the creation of Cardiff County Borough Council, South remained as one of the ten new electoral wards created in the county borough. A by-election, took place on 23 September 1889 in the South ward to replace Mr J. A. le Boulanger, who had died. The by-election was only five weeks before the first full council election of the new county borough. John Jenkins, president of Cardiff Trades Council was put up as a Liberal-Labour candidate, against the Conservative contender, James Tucker. The polling station was at the South Church Street Boards School in Butetown. Tucker won the election with 52% of the vote, the first Conservative representation in the ward since before 1886. By 1890, the ward's three councillors were Mr Tucker and two Liberals, Mr F. J. Beavan and Mr T. Morel. At the 1890 Cardiff elections Cllr Beavan lost to the Conservative, Mr J. H. Cory (a ship-owner). Cory left immediately after the results without making a speech. The Cardiff Times described how Beavan, \\"one of the most industrious servants of the ratepayers\\", had secured the working class vote but has sustained a \\"determined attack\\" from the Conservatives and the non-resident voters of the ward (entitled to vote because of ownership of offices and businesses in the area). Cardiff Town Council 1836-1889 \\"South\\" was one of two Cardiff wards to the new elected council in 1836. Councillors took turns to 'retire' for re- election, on a three-yearly cycle. By the 1870s there were four wards in the town (North, South, East and West). The November 1873 elections saw the two 'retiring' councillors, Mr Thompson and Mr North, not stand for re-election. They had been councillors for three years and were agents of Cardiff's major landowner, Lord Bute. They had been elected in \\"the most desparate Municipal contest on record\\", with ratepayers being given no alternative but to vote for their master's candidates. There was a feeling this tactic wouldn't work again. The subsequent election was won by Mr J. Winstone Snr and Mr Rees Jones.

The following day, the song was made available on most major digital streaming sites through Sargent House. The Armed announced they had signed with the label coinciding with the release of \\"Ft.

The single's cover art features Frank Carter of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes.  Unauthorized vocal samples  As the song's title suggests, \\"Ft. Frank Turner\\" features vocals from English folk punk musician Frank Turner. Early news reports about the song's release erroneously reported Turner was not present on the track. However, later that day, Turner posted to his social media accounts that he recognized his vocal tracks as originating from an unused and unfinished demo from a recording session with Kurt Ballou from eight years prior, and he did not authorize use of the tracks for \\"Ft.

In a tongue-in-cheek Facebook post announcing the new single, The Armed acknowledged the song was \\"riddled with uncleared samples.\\" About the unauthorized vocal tracks, Turner said, \\"I was not at any point aware this was happening, don't know the band personally (though I am a casual fan), and didn't clear this.\\" Concluding Turner's Twitter thread, he said that he had reached out to all parties involved in the creation and release of the single, but none of them were responding to his inquiries. The band's media representatives have given differing responses to journalists' requests for comment regarding the controversy. When Pitchfork reached out, their reps pointed the publication to the American photographer and appropriation artist Sherrie Levine. When Stereogum reached out, The Armed trolled the publication by pretending to confuse Frank Turner with Frank Carter. The band replied, \\"It saddens us to hear that he's upset about the song. We've been big fans of Gallows for a long time.\\"  Music video  The music video for \\"Ft. Frank Turner\\" was directed by Tony Wolski and co-produced by Joe Gall. The video's story centers around a convenience store clerk wearing a ghillie suit who is trying to close up shop, but can't because of two loitering customers. He ditches his post at the store to go skateboarding, but his friend (who is also wearing a ghillie suit) is struck in a hit-and-run accident.

Early life and education Busa was born on December 16, 1994 in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte, Philippines. He is one of the six children of Lore Busa and Liza Tupaz. As a child, Busa grew up in a household filled with jazz and soul music and began singing at 5 during family gatherings, though his parents discouraged him from pursuing music as a career. In 2011, Busa obtained his bachelor's degree in hotel, restaurant and institutional management at De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde. Career In 2015, Busa joined To the Top, GMA Network's talent search for their newest boy band, where he made it to the grand finals. He received another opportunity with the company and had an acting contract with them for two years that did not include singing; he felt as if he were \\"left in the dark.\\" Sometime after the competition, comedian Arnell Ignacio discovered one of Busa's karaoke videos on Facebook and began mentoring him at a time that he had become discouraged with the loss and without support from his parents. In 2016, Busa played the role of Mocha, a guest character in GMA Network's TV series entitled Sa Piling ni Nanay starring Mark Herras, Katrina Halili and Yasmien Kurdi. Busa's story of early discouragement and mentorship resurfaced when he auditioned for an international singing competition entitled Bolt of Talent, catching Michael Bolton's attention with its similarity to his own story. Busa went on to win as the grand champion. The finale was held in Malaysia. In 2019, Busa auditioned for Idol Philippines (the third incarnation of Philippine franchise of Idol) on ABS-CBN, where he sang \\"What You Won't Do For Love\\" by Bobby Caldwell.

Menstrual waste is largely ignored in schools in developing countries, despite it being a significant problem. Menstruation can be a barrier to education for many girls, as a lack of effective sanitary products restricts girls' involvement in educational and social activities. Menstrual Hygiene Day creates an occasion for publicizing information about menstrual hygiene management issues in the media. The day offers an opportunity to actively advocate for the integration of menstrual hygiene management into global, national and local policies and programmes.  Terminology  An accepted definition of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) is: * \\"Women and adolescent girls use a clean material to absorb or collect menstrual blood, and this material can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of menstruation. * MHM also includes using soap and water for washing the body as required; and having access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials.\\"UNICEF, Columbia University (2012). WASH in Schools - Empowers Girls' Education - Proceedings of Menstrual Hygiene Management in Schools Virtual Conferences. UNICEF and Columbia University, USA, p. 2 The \\"value chain\\" related to menstrual hygiene management includes four aspects: awareness, access, use as well as waste management. The term ‚Äúmenstrual health‚Äù is broader than menstrual hygiene. It encompasses both the menstrual hygiene management practices and the broader systemic factors that link menstruation with health, well-being, gender, education, equity, empowerment, and human rights (in particular the human right to water and sanitation).Keith, B. (2016). Girls‚Äô and women‚Äôs right to menstrual health: Evidence and opportunities - Outlook on reproductive health. PATH, Seattle, USA, UNICEF now (since 2019) uses the term MHH for \\"menstrual health and hygiene\\". These systematic factors include accurate and timely knowledge, available, safe, and affordable materials, informed and comfortable professionals, referral and access to health services, sanitation and washing facilities, positive social norms, safe and hygienic disposal and advocacy and policy.  Challenges  Celebration of Menstrual Hygiene Day in Amra Padatik, India Menstrual hygiene management can be particularly challenging for girls and women in developing countries, where clean water and toilet facilities are often inadequate. In addition, traditional cultures make it difficult to discuss menstruation openly. This limits women's and adolescent girls‚Äô access to relevant and important information about the normal functions of their own body. This directly affects their health, education and dignity. Access to information can be considered a human right. Currently there are about 3.73 billion women in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 52% , or 1.9 billion, of those women are of reproductive age, thus menstruating (WHO,2018).World Health Organization. (2018).

In 2016, Loughnan, Libbet C., Rob Bain, Rosemary Rop, Marni Sommer, and Tom Slaymaker.Loughnan, Libbet C., Rob Bain, Rosemary Rop, Marni Sommer, and Tom Slaymaker. \\"What Can Existing Data on Water and Sanitation Tell Us About Menstrual Hygiene Management?\\" Waterlines 35.3 (2016): 228-44. Web. discussed findings by the Water Supply and Sanitation Council (WSSCC) having estimated that daily 300 million women are menstruating. On average, according to the WSSCC, a women will spend about 3,500 days during her life menstruating. Many young girls and women of menstruating age live in poor socio-economic environments. WIlber, Torondel,Hameed, Mahon and Kuper (2019) state that 663 million people lack basic access to safe water, and 2.4 billion people lack adequate access to basic sanitary conditions. For women and girls, the lack of safe, accessible water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is particularly troubling during menstruation and childbirth. According to data collected and reported on, Loughnan (2017)Loughnan, Libbet. (2017, April ,17). Retrieved from: https://blogs.worldbank.org/water/lack-access- toilet-and-handwashing- materials-hits-women-and-girls-hardest-especially-when points out that half a billion (or 13%) of women lacked a place to defecate, have little to no privacy for menstrual hygiene management, and 3/4 of those lacked access to soap and water. In a 2014 study conducted in India, the researchers found that as many as 42% of women who participated in the study did not know about sanitary pads or from where in their anatomy menstruation originated. \\"Most of them were scared or worried on first menstruation.\\" Worldwide, in 2018, one in three women does not have access to a working toilet at all. Menstrual hygiene management issues have been ignored by professionals in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector, and in the health and education sectors, too.House, S., Mahon, T., Cavill, S. (2012). Menstrual hygiene matters - A resource for improving menstrual hygiene around the world. Wateraid, UK, p.8School toilets for girls in Tanzania, if they exist, often have no facilities to dispose of pads. = Health and psycho-social aspects = Poor MHM may affect the reproductive tract, but the specific infections, the strength of effect, and the route of transmission remain unclear. In India, a majority of girls are at risk for reproductive tract infections (RTI) because of poor MHM and RTI can lead to various disabilities if not treated early on. Reproductive tract infections are the cause of 30‚Äì50% of prenatal infection. Due to prejudices surrounding the issue, some women in India do not eat or take showers during their menstruation. Girls' self-image may be negatively impacted by adverse attitudes towards menstruation. = Sanitation facilities at schools = The onset of menstruation is challenging for school-aged girls in low-income settings. Impacts can include school absenteeism, missed class time, reduced participation, teasing, fear and shame, and risky adaptive behaviours. Further challenges that menstruating school girls face are a lack of knowledge, communication, and practical guidance prior to menarche and during menstruation; inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities; and ineffective or unavailable menstrual management materials. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, girls can miss up to 5 days of school a month or drop out entirely due to insufficient access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and menstrual hygiene products. Improving access to WASH facilities can actually increase girls' attendance at school. A program for school sanitation in Bangladesh increased girls' enrollment at school by 11%. Menstrual waste is largely ignored in schools in developing countries, despite it being a significant problem. Girls' access to water and sanitation at school is only available at 47% and 46% of all schools globally. Often, school toilets for girls (if they even exist) are missing bins for menstrual waste collection with the result that pads may be spread all around the school compound area.Kjell√©n, M., Pensulo, C., Nordqvist, P., Fogde, M. (2012). Global review of sanitation systems trends and interactions with menstrual management practices - Report for the menstrual management and sanitation systems project. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Stockholm, Sweden, p. 25 This pollutes the environment and also causes embarrassment for the school girls. In the United States, among other countries, girls who are unable to afford feminine hygiene products may miss school in order \\"to avoid the embarrassment of staining their clothes.\\" =Access to materials= In low- income countries, girls‚Äô choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms.UNESCO (2014). Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management - Good Policy and Practice in health Education - Booklet 9. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris, France, p. 32 A lack of affordable hygiene products means inadequate, unhygienic alternatives are used, which can present a serious health risk.African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC). Experiences and Problems with Menstruation Among Poor Women and Schoolgirls in Nairobi. In: Policy Brief No. 20. Nairobi, Kenya: APHRC, 2010.Obiria M. Kenyan students could solve sanitary problem with banana-fibre pad. The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/26/kenyan-girls- sanitary-problem-banana-fibre-pad. 26 Sep 2014. Menstrual cups offer a long- term solution compared to some other feminine hygiene products because they do not need to be replaced monthly. The quality of the material also makes them a reliable and healthy menstrual hygiene solution, as long as there is access to clean water for washing them. Girls and women in the workplace often miss work because they don't have access to sanitary materials and places of employment in some countries don't provide resources for women or even have \\"proper toilets.\\" Women in Bangladesh who work in factories have reported that due to the cost of sanitary products for menstruation which they could not afford, they have resorted to using \\"factory-floor rags in place of pads and tampons, leading to dangerous infections and missed work.\\" Menstruation can be a barrier to education for many girls, as a lack of effective sanitary products restricts girls' involvement in educational and social activities. Often they do not attend school due to fear of leaking, shame or embarrassment, period pain or inadequate sanitation facilities that do not allow them to wash or change in privacy. This applies mainly to schoolgirls from low-income families, since disposable hygiene products are a monthly expense that many females simply cannot afford. Adequate sanitation facilities and access to menstrual hygiene products are just one part of the solution to menstrual taboos that impede women's progress in many developing countries. Knowledge is critical for girls to feel comfortable with menstruation and to gain a positive awareness of their bodies.Kirk, J.; Sommer, M. (2006): Menstruation and Body Awareness. Linking Girls Health With Girls Education . Royal Tropical Institute (KIT), Amsterdam  U.S. and UK  Many low-income and/or homeless girls and women in the inner cities of the United States cannot afford sanitary supplies. Food banks in New York report that feminine hygiene products are in high demand. Homeless women in the United States may face the challenge of not being able to shower or use the communal toilet in homeless shelters as often as they need to in cases where there are restrictions on toilet usage. In New York, proposals to help lower income women access menstrual sanitary supplies includes proposals to remove the sales tax on feminine hygiene products and \\"distributing free tampons in public schools.\\" Sales tax are levied on menstrual supplies in 36 states. On May 1, 2018 The National Diaper Bank Network, which provides millions of diapers to poor and low income parents and advocates for policy change around basic needs, launched the Alliance for Period Supplies and began distributing free period products through allied organizations across the U.S. Homeless women in other industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom, face problems affording tampons and sanitary napkins. =Disposal of used materials= A review in 2018 found that disposal of menstrual waste is often neglected in sanitation systems. This leads to improper disposal and negative impacts on users, the sanitation systems and the environment. = Taboos = Despite the fact that menstruation is a healthy biological process, it is approached with hesitance and misinformation because of deeply-rooted cultural taboos surrounding menstruation. Cultural, religious and traditional beliefs ‚Äî particularly in developing countries ‚Äî can lead to restrictions that women or girls face during their period. In some societies, women do not wash their bodies, shower or bathe during menstruation. They may not be allowed to use water sources during menstruation. Even if they have access to toilets, they might not use them because of the fear of staining the toilet bowls (in the case of dry toilets or flush toilets where the flush is not powerful). This impairs the use of menstrual cups compared to pads as the cups are normally emptied into toilets. Expanding the discussion to include consideration of waste management is part of the attempt to \\"normalize\\" conversations about menstruation.  Approaches for improvements  MHM in schools should not be a stand-alone programme but should be integrated with existing programmes on WASH in schools, school health and nutrition programmes, puberty education programmes, and emergencies. In rural Bolivia a menstrual hygiene management game was developed for school girls, that stimulated detailed responses, and diversified participatory activities in focus group discussions. The board game helped to ease girls‚Äô discomfort discussing menstruation.

It began forming in August 1941, in the Central Asian Military District. It was first assigned to Southwestern Front but on its arrival it was seen to be far from combat-ready and so was moved north to the Moscow area for further training. It was finally assigned to the 3rd Shock Army in Kalinin Front and took part in the battle for the Kholm Pocket. Following this the division was moved to 1st Shock Army and took part in the dismal fighting for the Demyansk salient until it was finally evacuated by the German forces in March, 1943. The division moved on into the gradual advance across the Baltic states through 1943 and 1944, winning a battle honor along the way, until February, 1945, when it was transferred with its 93rd Rifle Corps to 1st Ukrainian Front as part of 59th Army. In the last weeks of the war the 391st was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its service in Upper Silesia, and ended the war advancing on Prague, but despite its distinguished record it was selected as one of the many divisions to be disbanded during the summer of 1945. Formation The 391st began forming on August 19, 1941 at Alma-Ata in the Central Asia Military District,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 81, states the division formed in September. Its order of battle was as follows: * 1024th Rifle Regiment * 1278th Rifle Regiment * 1280th Rifle Regiment * 951st Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Dmitrii Anatolevich Kovalenko was assigned to command of the division on August 28, and he would remain in command until March 8, 1942. In September the division's personnel were noted as being mostly Kazakh.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 These men had practically no time to train before they were ordered to the front. They arrived in the Volga Military District in mid-November and the division was briefly assigned to the 61st Army that was forming there, but instead of sending the raw unit into combat with that Army it was reassigned to the Moscow Defence Zone for more than a month of working-up.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 107-08Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 14 Battles of Kholm and Demyansk As part of the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive on January 23, 1942 the 33rd Rifle Division of 3rd Shock Army tenuously encircled the German forces defending the town of Kholm. Throughout January 24-26 the German Battlegroup Scherer barely held against constant Soviet attacks, but the two sides were at roughly the same strength so no decisive results could be obtained. On January 31 the 391st was released from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and began moving towards the pocket, which it reached in the second week of February along with the 146th Tank Battalion (two T-34s and 11 T-60s), the 44th Artillery Regiment (76mm guns) and three BM-8 multiple rocket launchers. There were now about 23,000 Soviet troops besieging about 4,500 German troops.Robert Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43: The frozen fortress, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2012, Kindle ed. The GPU building in Kholm near the end of the siegeOn February 13 Soviet artillery and aerial bombing struck the town heavily. The 1278th Rifle Regiment with tank support attacked the southwest sector held by Jagdcommando 8 without success, but the 82nd Regiment of the 33rd Division, backed by Lend-Lease Matilda II tanks, penetrated the main defensive line of the 386th Infantry Regiment, making a large dent in the Kholm perimeter and bringing Scherer's headquarters under direct fire. Attacks continued near the break-in point for five more days but the German regiment was finally able to seal off the breach. The additional artillery now allowed the Soviet forces to neutralize the airfield, forcing the German airlift to rely entirely on gliders and air drops. On the morning of February 21 the commander of 3rd Shock, Lt. Gen. M. A. Purkayev, began a new push with forces of the newly arrived 2nd Guards Rifle Corps, which attacked towards Dubrova, where a German artillery grouping had been firing in support of the pocket. Three days later the replenished 33rd and 391st Divisions attacked the southeast side of Kholm while the fresh 37th Rifle Brigade struck in the north, finally bringing the encirclement under simultaneous concentric attacks. Although Soviet tanks and infantry reached the GPU building, they could not capture it.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. By early March the German XXXIX Army Corps had managed to assemble something less than two divisions for a relief attack which failed due to worsening weather and stiff Soviet resistance. On March 9 Col. Andrei Kuzmich Kudryashov took command of the division from Colonel Kovalenko. The spring thaw arrived in early April, melting the German defenses built of ice and snow and exposing their forces to mortar and sniper fire, while 3rd Shock launched repeated unsuccessful attacks between April 2 and 18. In the end German assault guns broke the siege on May 5.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. Prior to this, in late April the 391st was transferred to the nearby 1st Shock Army of Northwestern Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 81 This Army faced the south side of the newly-formed \\"Ramushevo corridor\\" that had restored tenuous land communications with the previously encircled German II Army Corps at Demyansk.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. =Demyansk Pocket= On May 3 the Front made its first attempt to cut the 4km-wide corridor; 1st Shock attacked from the south while 11th Army struck from the north. The attempt was a failure although artillery fire prevented the German supply columns from using the road most of the time.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. On May 16, Col. Aleksei Stepanovich Frolov replaced Colonel Kudryashov in command; he was in turn replaced by Col. Pyotr Mitrofanovich Paramonov on July 2. The second attempt to sever the corridor began at 1400 hours on July 17. The 391st, now in the 1st Guards Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 121 formed one of the assault groups of 1st Shock Army, along with the 14th and 37th Rifle Brigades. Following a 90-minute artillery bombardment which barely scratched the German positions the attack went in and walked straight into carefully prepared engagement areas which quickly tore the shock groups to shreds. The Soviet artillery had insufficient stocks of shells and the attack degenerated into a battle of attrition and collapsed a week later having gained about a thousand metres of ground.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. A new offensive began on August 10 with the 391st again forming an assault group for 1st Shock, along with the 130th and 364th Rifle Divisions and the 37th Brigade, backed by 30 tanks. There was only enough artillery ammunition for a 10-minute bombardment which failed to dent the German defenses. Again these groups were badly shot up. On the next day Colonel Paramonov left his command of the division, being replaced on the 14th by Lt. Col. Vasilii Fedorovich Marchuk. In the course of the fighting the commander of 1st Guards Corps, Maj. Gen. N. D. Zakhvataev, was wounded. By August 21 the offensive had to be halted due to heavy casualties and insufficient supply of shells. While the corridor was again disrupted by Soviet artillery, no more than a few hundred metres of ground had been gained. The 391st was spared further action in another offensive in September. Following this, on September 27 the German 16th Army launched Operation Michael in an attempt to drive back or even destroy the 1st Guards Corps in a salient it held south of the corridor. Supported by artillery and airstrikes the Germans surrounded and overwhelmed one regiment of the 7th Guards Rifle Division within hours. After a six-day fight the east side of the salient was smashed in, and after a regrouping the west side was struck on October 7. With 1st Shock on the verge of a crushing defeat, the salient was evacuated.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. In the midst of this, on October 10 Maj. Gen. Maksim Evseevich Kozyr took command of the division. Soviet positions at Demyansk, spring 1943. The 391st was in the 1st Shock Army sector south of the Ramushevo corridorBy November 1 the 391st was a separate division in 1st Shock Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 209 The Soviet forces around Demyansk were intended to play a role in the second Soviet winter offensive, which also included Operation Uranus and Operation Mars, if only to tie down German forces that could be more usefully employed elsewhere. Yet another attack on the corridor began on the night of November 23/24, this time focused on its eastern end, but the division played no major role in it.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 100-01 The Demyansk pocket had always been partially supplied by air, and following the encirclement of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad those air assets were much more required to the south. Too late to make a difference, on January 31, 1943, Hitler authorized the evacuation of the salient.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. In the aftermath of Operation Iskra, which had restored land communications with Leningrad, Marshal Georgy Zhukov planned a further operation, Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda, intended to completely end the siege of that city and destroy Army Group North. Northwestern Front's role in the offensive would once again be the elimination of the Demyansk pocket. At the same time the German command was planning its Operation Ziethen, the phased withdrawal from the salient. 1st Shock Army's part in the offensive was to begin on February 19. It was regrouped westward to attack the south side of the mouth of the corridor and was reinforced with four tank regiments, two artillery divisions, two Guards Mortar divisions, and two aviation corps. The 391st and 7th Guards formed a secondary shock group to launch an attack on a 5km sector from Shotovo to Viazki, with the objective of taking the village of Ramushevo. In the event, nothing went as planned. In mid-month intense cold was replaced by continuous rain with reinforcements and supplies becoming bogged down. Ziethen began on February 17 and immediately began freeing up German troops to form reserves. 1st Shock's attack had to be postponed until February 26 by which time it was facing three German divisions instead of one. The assault troops managed to gain from 1 - 3km with great difficulty, and a further effort the next day was stopped in its tracks. In the midst of the carnage medical sledge-dog teams were used to evacuate wounded from the battlefield. The division's Medical Assistant Tartkov moved 98 men to aid posts, for which he was awarded the Order of Lenin.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp. 415-25 General Kozyr was moved to command of the 7th Guards on March 11, being replaced by Maj. Gen. Nikolai Pavlovich Anisimov. Kozyr would go on to become a Hero of the Soviet Union before being killed in action in April, 1945. The 391st and the 3rd Guards Airborne Divisions were by now so decimated in the fighting that they were replaced in the front line by the 6th and 9th Guards Airborne Divisions.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp. 434, 504 The division remained for most of the year in 1st Shock Army, by October under the 90th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 244 On October 16 General Anisimov was reassigned to the training establishment, being replaced by Col. Anton Demyanovich Timoshenko, who would remain in command for the duration. In November, when Northwestern Front was disbanded, the division was briefly moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command before being assigned to 2nd Baltic Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 108 Into the Baltic States As of December 1 the 391st was in the Front reserves,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 301 but by the start of 1944 it had been assigned to the 97th Rifle Corps of 6th Guards Army. Later in January it had been reassigned yet again, now serving as a separate division in 22nd Army of the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 10, 38 The Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive began on January 14 but in its early stages primarily involved the attacks by Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts against the German 18th Army. By mid-February the 16th Army found itself in a deep salient leaving it vulnerable to a joint offensive by 2nd Baltic and Leningrad Fronts. Planning for the Staraya Russa-Novorzhev Offensive began on February 17; however, Army Group North was by now acutely aware of the danger and began its own action on the same day, beginning with a withdrawal from Staraya Russa. On the 19th the 22nd Army began its pursuit of the German II Corps. During this advance Kholm was finally liberated on February 21. On the night of February 24/25 joint forces of the 22nd and 1st Shock Armies captured Dedovichi. The exploitation continued the next day as the 391st attacked the 15th Latvian SS Division, forcing it to withdraw and destroying the small German garrison at Chikhachyovo.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 396-99 In the last days of the month the division moved back to the 1st Shock Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 67 but in the face of increasing German resistance that Army went over to the defense in early March after an advance of nearly 180km.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, p. 400 =Baltic Offensive= German POWs march through Rezekne, 1944In June the 391st was moved back to the 3rd Shock Army as a separate division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 188 At the start of the summer campaign it was facing the defenses of the Panther Line, southeast of Idritsa.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 9 Pushing past these and into the Baltic states the division was finally awarded a battle honor for its part in the liberation of Rezekne, Latvia:Shortly afterwards the division was subordinated to the 93rd Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 108 By September 1 the 93rd Corps had been transferred to the 42nd Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 249 and was approaching Krustpils by mid-month.

S. Konev, presented his plan for subsequent operations. Upon the arrival of the Front's main group of forces in the Neisse area the 59th and 60th Armies were to develop the attack from the bridgehead north of Ratibor to the west and southwest. Ultimately this operation would encircle and destroy the German group of forces in the Oppeln salient. 59th Army would launch its main attack along the left flank with the 93rd and 115th Rifle Corps and the 7th Guards Mechanized Corps in the general direction of Kostenthal and Zultz. 93rd Corps would have just the 98th Division in the first echelon. The 391st would be committed on the second day with the objective of reaching a line from Ober Glogau to Deutsch Rasselwitz to Stundorf.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 469, 477 The offensive on the 59th and 60th Army's sector began at 0850 hours on March 15 following an 80-minute artillery preparation and went largely according to plan although more slowly than expected. The main German defense zone was broken through on a 12km front and advanced 6 - 8km during the day. Bad weather prevented air support before noon, and the advancing forces also had to repel ten counterattacks. In response Marshal Konev ordered that the advance continue through the night. During the day on March 16 the 59th Army managed to advance another 3 - 9km, and the 93rd Rifle and 7th Guards Mechanized Corps cleared the entire depth of the German defenses and set the stage for the success of the attack over the next two days. By the end of March 17 the two corps had reached the line Tomas - Schenau - Kittledorf while the 115th Corps covered against flank attacks from the north. By noon on the next day the 93rd and 7th Guards forced the Hotzenplotz River and began to pursue the remnants of the defeated German forces. During the day the 59th Army linked up with the 21st Army, encircling the 20th SS, 168th and 344th Infantry Divisions, part of the 18th SS Panzergrenadier Division, and several independent regiments and battalions in the area southwest of Oppeln.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 503-04, 506-09 With the encirclement completed the 93rd Corps was tasked with preventing the encircled grouping from breaking out to the southwest. The 391st and the 26th Guards Mechanized Brigade of 7th Guards Corps were ordered to securely hold the line Neustadt - Kunzendorf - Kreschendorf in order to prevent a breakthrough by German forces into the encirclement from the south. On March 19 up to a battalion of encircled infantry, supported by tanks and assault guns, attacked the left flank of the division in the Hozenplotz area but this, along with a larger attack against other elements of the Corps, was quickly recognized as a feint to disguise the actual direction of the planned breakout, which was in the 21st Army's sector. All these efforts were beaten back, as was a break-in attempt by the Hermann G√∂ring Panzer Division towards Steinau. At the same time the remaining encircling forces attacked into the pocket to break up and liquidate the defenders. By March 20 this task was largely completed, with total German casualties of 30,000 killed, 15,000 prisoners, 21 aircraft, 57 tanks and assault guns and 464 guns of various calibers. On March 21 the 59th Army resumed its advance in the direction of J√§gerndorf which it reached but did not take on March 31. Due to the toll of casualties during the offensive and inadequate supplies of ammunition, the Army was ordered to go over to the defense.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, pp. 510-14, 519-20 Postwar On April 26 the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in the capture of Oppeln in Upper Silesia. Beginning on May 6 it advanced with its Corps and Army in the Prague offensive, and took part in the final encirclement of Army Group Center.

It opened in October 1972 to replace the underused Cincinnati Union Terminal, and closed in July 1991 when Amtrak moved service back to the restored Union Terminal. History The Cardinal at the station in 1989 The abandoned station in 2005 Cincinnati Union Terminal, opened in 1933, was among the newest big-city stations in the United States. Once serving 216 trains per day, it was reduced to just two routes‚Äìthe James Whitcomb Riley to Chicago and the George Washington to Washington and Newport News‚Äìwhen Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail service on May 1, 1971. The underused station cost Amtrak $4 million per year to run. Additionally, on July 12, 1971, the Riley and George Washington merged into a single long-distance Chicago-Washington train, with the eastbound train known as the George Washington and the westbound train known as the James Whitcomb Riley. However, the two trains had been inherited from different railroads‚Äìthe Riley from Penn Central (formerly New York Central), the George from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (C&O;). This forced a half-hour delay to use a balloon loop north of Union Terminal to face the train in the correct direction. The two total trains, which between them saw fewer than 30 boardings and alightings per day, were nowhere near enough to justify such a large station. On October 29, 1972, Amtrak opened a new, smaller station on the south side of the River Road highway viaduct, about southwest of Union Terminal and west of downtown Cincinnati. The first station custom-built for Amtrak, it cost $270,000 but was expected to save the company $500,000 in operating costs. It was located on the ex-New York Central line between Cincinnati and Indianapolis used by the Riley/George, and thus avoided the need for the slow loop turnaround. However, on October 6, 1973, Amtrak rerouted the Riley/George off deteriorating ex-NYC track in Indiana, moving it instead to ex-Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) trackage between Indianapolis and Cincinnati. Because the PRR approached Cincinnati from the east rather than the west, a long and complex backup move was necessary for trains to reach River Road station. On May 19, 1974, the George Washington name was dropped, and the James Whitcomb Riley name was applied in both directions. On August 1, 1974, Amtrak rerouted the Riley off Penn Central trackage altogether, switching it to C&O; trackage between Chicago and Cincinnati. However, the C&O; approached Cincinnati from the north and a backup move was still required. The Chicago-Norfolk Mountaineer began service via Cincinnati on March 24, 1975, followed by the Cincinnati-Washington, D.C. Shenandoah on October 31, 1976. On October 30, 1977, the Riley was renamed as the Cardinal. Yet another reroute of the Cardinal - this one between Cincinnati and Cottage Grove, Indiana on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on July 17, 1978 - still required a backup move to serve River Road station. The Mountaineer was discontinued on June 1, 1977. The Shenandoah and Cardinal were both discontinued on September 30, 1981 amid budget cuts, briefly ending rail service to Cincinnati. However, the Cardinal was restored on January 8, 1982. Union Terminal was remodeled as the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal in 1990. The remodel enabled Amtrak to return to Union Terminal on July 29, 1991, eliminating the backup move to River Road station. River Road station was ultimately demolished in 2010 when the adjacent Waldvogel Viaduct was realigned. Attributes The station had a modern design and 1,500 square feet. It was small, with a 25-seat air conditioned waiting room. It also included a ticket counter, restrooms, a crew room, and a parking lot for 30 cars. The building itself cost $90,000. The station and its parking lot were designed so that both could be enlarged if traffic increased.

An English language translation by Adam Cullen was published in 2015. The novel centers on a group of writers, musicians, and scholars in Estonia before, during, and after that nation's independence from the Soviet Union. The title refers to The Cave, a semi-exclusive underground bar in Tallinn where the principal characters gather to drink and debate over the course of several decades.  Plot and summary  \\"The Cavemen Chronicle\\" explores recent Estonian history, from the era of Soviet repression to Estonian independence and beyond, through the eyes of a group of intellectuals whose stories intersect and diverge and whose lives, in the narrator's words, \\"expressed the age.\\" The novel is divided into four main chronological sections: * \\"The Old Age,\\" set in the 1960s and 1970s and chronicling the childhood and early adulthood of the protagonists. * \\"The Middle Ages,\\" set in the 1980s and introducing The Cave, the underground pub where the major characters and many minor ones gather on a regular basis to discuss their lives, debate philosophy, and comment on the state of the world. * \\"The New Era,\\" a short section centered around the creation of the Independent Republic of Estonia between 1988 and 1991. * \\"The Newest Age,\\" spanning the 1990s and early 2000s, as the characters adjust to a life in which freedom of expression is celebrated but economic security has been greatly reduced. Major characters include: * Teedu T√§rn, a university lecturer who early on decides that working within the Soviet system is the best course and, with the coming of independence, must grapple with that choice. * Mati T√µusum√§gi, a magazine editor who delights in publishing subversive ideas disguised as cultural commentary, is expelled from the university, and eventually becomes a leader of the Estonian independence movement. * Juhan \\"Juku\\" Raudtuvi, the book's narrator, a Persian translator who ends up working as a gossip columnist. * Klaus, an artist, poet, and actor who eventually becomes famous as a musician and independence advocate. * Manglus, a charismatic, hard-partying artist who rises to become Minister of Culture in the new republic. * Pekka, a Finnish poet who works as a tour guide and gives the Estonians a glimpse of the economic pressures of a market economy. * Illimar, an autistic savant whose correspondence with Juku over several decades reflects his descent into dementia. By the end of the novel, several characters have died and others still struggle to adapt to a world where their Soviet-era identities have been subsumed by a new state, a market economy, and constant technological change. As Mutt stated in a 2018 interview: \\"Back in the Soviet era everyone knew who you were, they knew your face. It was an age with no mass media, and to be a writer was to be a celebrity in an age of no celebrity. ... The numbers for some of the books I published in the 1980s were astonishing‚Äî40,000 copies sold, a million people or more reading my work. But I'm still suspicious of these numbers, which seemed unlikely then and, frankly, impossible to conceive of today.\\"  Historical references  \\"The Cavemen Chronicle\\" is set firmly within the historical context of the last half-century in Estonia, but major events of the period are often mentioned briefly, if at all. One exception is the Estonian Song Festival of September 1988 (the novel places the event in August), which comprises much of the third section of the book. The event, organized by opponents of the Soviet occupation, attracted more than 100,000 people to the Song Festival Grounds outside Tallinn, where traditional and patriotic Estonian songs were performed in defiance of Soviet prohibitions. The moment is considered one of the landmarks of civil disobedience during the Baltics uprising. In the novel, however, the event is used in part for comedic effect, as the principal characters spend several pages debating whether to go to the festival grounds and perhaps witness history in the making, or alternatively to stay away, continue drinking, and merely lie to everyone later by claiming they had, in fact, been at the event. Some reviews have suggested that Mutt's novel is highly autobiographical and that many of the characters are based on real-life individuals. At least one, Estonian author and theater director Mati Unt, appears as himself. The Cave, the tavern around which most of the book's plot revolves, is based on an actual underground nightclub in Tallinn, the KuKu Club.  Awards  \\"The Cavemen Chronicle\\" won the Virumaa Literature Prize for the best historical novel in 2013.

Famous for clean sandy beaches and mineral springs in its many small lakes, Dzharylhach is the largest island in the Black Sea. Portions of the park have been protected nature reserves for almost 100 years, as the area is an environmentally sensitive representative of north Black Sea Coast nature habitat. Administratively, the park is in the Skadovsk District of Kherson Oblast. Topography Dzharylhach Island is a long, thin line of sand and shoals, running west-to-east in the bay between the Crimean Peninsula to the south, and the mainland to the north. At times of low water, the shoals can become exposed to join the island as a spit of the mainland. The coastal waters are very shallow, typically less than 1 meter. The characteristic salty soil of the island is called solonetz. The bay is part of the Ramsar Wetland of International Importance Climate and ecoregion The official climate designation for the Dzharylhak area is Humid continental climate - hot summer sub-type (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfa), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a hot summer (at least four months averaging over , at least one of which is over . The average temperature in January is , and floating ice may appear in the bay for 1‚Äì5 days. Average temperature in July is , in the middle of a hot summer season that typical lasts for 5 months. Winds of 6‚Äì12 m/s are observed an average of 223 days per year; absolute calm is very rare. Flora and fauna The plants on the island are specialized for the environment, and include psammophytes (plants that grow in loose and shifting sand), halophytes (plants adapted to saline habitats), reed-beds in fresh and saline wetlands, the representative flora of coastal meadows and seaside steppe, and synanthropes (wild plants associated with proximity to humans, in this case tree and shrub plantations). Over 500 species of vascular plants, in 72 families are recorded in the terrestrial borders of the park. Wild Mouflon, a vulnerable species of wild sheep, in the park There are over 80 species of invertebrates in the park. Because the area contains many shallow coastal flats with protective thickets, it is famous for crayfish, crabs, and fish. The bay itself is known for mussels and fish. Wild animals include deer, boar, and Mouflon (a type of wild sheep). Public use Park management sponsors educational programs for children and school groups, as well as public- awareness activities and ecological tours.

Up to 1.5 million civilians lived in the city, sparking concerns among various organizations of a large humanitarian crisis. Lise Grande, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, stated, \\"In a worst-case scenario, we're literally looking at the single largest humanitarian operation in the world in 2016.\\" Save the Children warned that massive civilian bloodshed was likely, unless safe routes were authorized to let civilians flee. The U.S. government has accused ISIL of using civilians as human shields.  Human rights abuses  = ISIL abuses, abductions and atrocities = Fears that civilians could be used as human shields by ISIL were realized as it was confirmed the group had been abducting civilians from villages for this purpose, which received widespread condemnation from human rights groups and the United Nations Security Council. ISIL has reportedly threatened to execute civilians trying to flee. Snipers, landmines, toxic weapons and trenches were preventing people from attempting to escape. Iraqi officials, via radio broadcasts and leaflets dropped over the city, warned civilians to stay in their homes. Leaflets advised residents of various precautions to take including instructions to tape over their windows to protect from flying glass and to disconnect gas pipes. Shortly after the battle began, news surfaced of ISIL kidnapping and executing civilians in Mosul. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis stated that ISIL was using civilians as human shields and holding people against their will in the city. The International Business Times reported that ISIL has forced boys from Mosul as young as 12 to fight for them, and that ISIL had trained the children to \\"behead prisoners and make suicide bombs\\". An Iraqi intelligence source stated on 21 October that ISIL executed 284 men and boys abducted from Mosul for the purpose of using them as human shields. The civilians were shot and put in a mass grave. A United Nations official said the UN is \\"gravely worried\\" about the fate of 200 families from Somalia and 350 families from Najafia who were abducted Monday by ISIL, who could be used as human shields. UN sources stated that four people died from inhaling toxic fumes after ISIL set fire to the Al-Mishraq Chemical Factory on 23 October. On 26 October, CNN reported that ISIL has been carrying out \\"retribution killings\\" of civilians as revenge for others welcoming Iraqi and Peshmerga troops in villages restored under government control. According to Ravina Shamdasani, of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, ISIL executed 232 people near Mosul in late October for defying its orders and had taken tens of thousands of people to use as human shields against advancing Iraqi forces. She claimed that ISIL \\"executed 42 civilians in Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul. Also on Wednesday, ISIL executed 190 former Iraqi Security Forces for refusing to join them, in the Al Ghazlani base near Mosul.\\" Iraqi forces evacuated more than 1,000 civilians from the front lines surrounding Mosul on 26 October, moving them to the Khazir region. Civilians on the southern front had reported that their relatives had been taken by retreating ISIL fighters to be used as human shields. In October 2016, Iraqi government launched a military operation in Mosul to recapture the city from ISIL. Based on reports provided by the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, more than a million residents in Mosul are at risk and many of them were killed or used as human shields against the advance of Iraqi army. Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor warns that Iraqi government and international forces have to put an end to the humanitarian crisis in Mosul and provide its residents with their basic needs. ISIL has driven some of Mosul's residents out of their neighborhoods while others were prevented from fleeing to the regions controlled by Iraqi army. Human rights are violated by both ISIL, which drove about 550 families from the villages of As-Semalyya and An-Nejafyya, and Iraqi troops which captured 1,500 civilians from mosques and schools in the Dybka refugee camp. On 21 October 2016, another human rights violation committed by Iraqi army and police as they arrested almost hundreds of civilians and executing some villagers in the south of Mosul claiming that they are hosting ISIL militias. On the same day, Iraqi airstrikes targeted a funeral in Kirkuk province causing death of 20 people and injuring dozens others. Mosul's population reached to 1.5 million people, including 600,000 children who are besieged by ISIL militias and suffering from the shortage of food, water, electricity and medical care. ISIL militias monopolize the local hospitals in Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to treat only its supporters and members. About 690 families have been evacuated from the Makhmoor District east of Mosul and Al-Hemdanyya District to the Al- Hood camp. On 31 October, a member of the Nineveh Provincial Council stated that ISIL executed 300 civilians and former security members in the village of Moshairefa, north of Mosul. They had been imprisoned and accused of collaborating with the government. Mosul Eye reported on 3 November that mortar strikes killed five civilians in Mosul. Two roadside bombs struck a convoy of civilians fleeing Hawija on 4 November as the families were being taken to the town of Al-Alam. At least 18 people were killed, a police officer said. On 7 November, the Iraqi War Media Office announced that the bodies of estimated 300 people were found in a mass grave at the agriculture college in Hamam al-Alil, south of Mosul. Many had been decapitated. Iraqi forces made the discovery after noticing the smell. Abdul Rahman al-Waggaa, a member of the Nineveh provincial council, said ISIL had used the college as \\"a killing field.\\" The Iraqi War Media Office said there would be an investigation into the murders: \\"Inside the building of the Faculty of Agriculture there is a new crime: the presence of 100 beheaded bodies of citizens killed by terrorists, and a special team will be sent to inspect this heinous crime,\\" the office said in a statement. The United Nations reported on 8 November that ISIL had abducted 295 former Iraqi Security Forces members and 1,500 families from Hamam al-Alil, forcing them to retreat with the militants into Mosul. On 9 November, it was reported that ISIL killed at least 20 civilians after accusing them of being spies. Five crucified bodies were displayed at a traffic intersection, while others were left hanging from traffic signals and electricity poles. Civilians who had fled the city in the previous few days reported that ISIL was using suicide bombs to attack residents in addition to Iraqi forces. BBC News reported on 11 November that ISIL executed 40 civilians in Mosul after accusing them of being spies. One man was killed for defying the ban on mobile phone use. They were shot and their bodies displayed around the city. The U.N. Office of Human Rights provided new details that ISIL is using chemical weapons and has stockpiled \\"large quantities\\" of ammonia and sulfur. \\"We can only speculate how they intend to use this,\\" U.N. spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. \\"We are simply raising the alarm that this is happening, that this is being stockpiled.\\" On 17 November, Iraqi forces found two more mass graves near Hamam Alil, containing at least 250 bodies. One of the graves was inside a well. \\"We believe the well contains more than 200 bodies. ISIS used this mass grave to kill and dump people over the past two years,\\" Iraqi Federal Police Commander Brig. Gen. Faris Radhi Abbas told CNN. In late February 2017, Iraqi forces uncovered the largest known mass grave dug by ISIL at the \\"Khafsa Sinkhole\\" near Mosul, containing the bodies of 4,000 Iraqi government personnel. They had been killed by ISIL shortly after the Fall of Mosul in June 2014. According to the United Nations, ISIL killed at least 163 civilians on 1 June 2017 in the al-Shira neighbourhood to prevent them from fleeing western Mosul. On 3 July 2017, forensic medicine doctors recovered 74 dead bodies that were likely to be killed by ISIL for trying to flee on the streets in al-Zanjili district, northwest of the city. On 24 July 2017, a mass grave containing sixty bodies, was discovered in western Mosul, with 44 of them belongs to security agents of the Nineveh police. Iraqi Cap. Ahmed al-Obaidi said the body showed signs of torture, and some which seemed to have been shot in the heads. On 2 November 2017, UN assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) published a report on liberation of Mosul and concluded that ISIL members should face \\"international crimes\\" charges. = Allegations against anti-ISIL forces = The presence with Iraqi forces of several militias with histories of human rights abuses was criticized; Human Rights Watch called for Shia militias from the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) not to enter Mosul, following allegations of abuse of Sunni Muslims in anti-ISIL operations in Fallujah, Tikrit and Amirli. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi later stated that only the Iraqi army and the Iraqi national police would enter the city itself. On 21 October, International Business Times reported that \\"disturbing and graphic footage posted to social media allegedly shows Iraqi security forces torturing and interrogating young children for information about ISIL as they attempt to retake Mosul from the Islamic State terror group.\\" On 11 November, the multiple news outlets including Al Arabiya, Daily Mirror and Middle East Monitor reported about a leaked video of the Iraqi Special Forces allegedly murdering an Iraqi Sunni child by running him over with an M1 Abrams tank. The boy, identified as Muhammad Ali Al-Hadidi, was dragged through the desert and shot before the tank was run over him. The men in the video were identified as Shia militiamen and yelled sectarian slurs at the child as well asking the cameraman to film them doing it. The video caused outrage on social media, with Arab users of social media using the hashtag #CrushedByATank (). The soldiers were wearing the insignia of the Iraqi Special Forces. On 19 January, Iraqi forces summarily executed three civilians who they later claimed were IS suspects. The Middle East Monitor claimed Iraqi Shia Groups of targeting Sunni Arabs \\"in a possible genocide\\", and claimed that \\"Sunni Arabs are being targeted for ethnic cleansing by Iraqi Christians\\". However, Middle East Monitor was the sole origin of the report. On 17 March, a U.S.-led coalition airstrike in Mosul killed more than 200 civilians.\\"Coalition says it hit Mosul site where civilians died \\". Al Jazeera. 26 March 2017.\\"US admits it conducted Mosul air strike 'at location' where '200' civilians died \\". The Independent. 26 March 2017. Amnesty International's senior investigator on crisis response said: \\"The high civilian toll suggests that coalition forces leading the offensive in Mosul have failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.\\"\\"Iraq: Civilians killed by airstrikes in their homes after they were told not to flee Mosul \\". Amnesty International. 28 March 2017. On 12 July, after the Iraqi Government's declaration of victory, a video posted online by the Mosul Eye blog showing a man suspected to be an ISIL fighter was being held in a building and then dragged by soldiers across an open area to a ledge above a drop of at least 30 feet, where another body lied motionless. A second video also showed a man in Iraqi Army fatigues gunning down an unarmed man kneeling in front of a car. The Iraqi government later said they were investigating the footage. An estimate in mid-July 2017 by Kurdish intelligence put the total number of civilian casualties at 40,000. The largest portion of this loss of life is attributable to the unyielding artillery bombardment by Iraqi government forces ‚Äì in particular, units of the Iraqi federal police ‚Äì of west Mosul. Killings by ISIL and air strikes were two other significant sources of civilian deaths. On 19 July, Human Rights Watch published a report stating that Iraqi forces extrajudicial killings, torture and unlawful detention in the final phase of the battle and details the discovery of the corpses of 17 men, executed in an empty building in west Mosul, on 17 July. On 27 July, Human Rights Watch urged the US government to suspend all support for the Iraqi Army's 16th Division after members of the 16th Division lead four naked men, suspected to be ISIL fighters, down an alleyway, after which they heard multiple gunshots. One of the observers saw the bodies of a number of naked men lying in a doorway, one of whom appeared to have been handcuffed and had a rope tied around his legs. The UN report on 2 November 2017, also urged Iraqi authorities to \\"investigate alleged violations and human rights abuses\\" by Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and associated forces during the military operation. = Use of chemical weapons = The World Health Organization stated on 4 March 2017 that twelve people were being treated in Erbil for possible exposure to chemical weapons in Mosul. The WHO said that they had enabled \\"an emergency response plan to safely treat men, women and children who may be exposed to the highly toxic chemical[s]\\" and were preparing for more patients with exposure to these agents. According to the UN, four patients show \\"severe signs associated with exposure to a blister agent\\", which they were exposed to on the eastern side of the city.\\"Alleged Mosul chemical attack mounts to war crime\\" , via aljazeera.com.

She served as a lighthouse keeper for 41 years, including a 29-year stint at the Little Traverse Light.  Early life  Williams (n√©e Whitney) was born on Mackinac Island, Michigan, on June 24, 1844. By the time she was four years old, her family had moved to Beaver Island where her father, a carpenter, worked for the Mormon leader \\"King\\" James Strang. In 1852, after being pressured to convert, the Whitney family fled to Charlevoix and then to Traverse City. After Strang was assassinated and the Mormons were forced out, the Whitney family returned to Beaver Island in 1857 where Williams met and married Clement Van Riper, a cooper from Detroit, in 1860. Van Riper began teaching in the nearby Anishinaabe community on Garden Island, where Williams assisted her husband and taught gardening techniques.  Career  In 1869, Van Riper was appointed keeper of the Beaver Island Harbor Light after the prior keeper, Peter McKinley, resigned due to poor health. However, Van Riper was also often in poor health and Williams assisted her husband by cleaning and polishing the Fresnel lens. During a stormy night in 1872, Van Riper rowed out to help rescue a sinking ship but never returned. The duty fell on Williams to keep the light burning in the lighthouse during the three-day storm and she was left \\"weak from sorrow.\\" A few weeks after her husband's death she was officially appointed keeper of the Beaver Island Harbor Light during a time when few women were ever appointed and lighthouse keeping was thought of as a man's job due to the physical labor and investment of time. She found the responsibility daunting but \\"longed to do something for humanity's sake\\" and seemed to view tending the light as both a calling and comfort. In 1875, Williams remarried‚Äîto photographer Daniel Williams‚Äîand eventually requested a transfer to a lighthouse on the mainland. In September 1884, she was transferred to the newly constructed Little Traverse Light at Harbor Springs. Williams excelled at her work and later won an award for best- kept light on the Great Lakes. By 1897, she was one of only four female lighthouse keepers on the Great Lakes, down from about 30 in 1851, due to the position becoming a political appointment and thus a way to repay campaign favors. In 1905, Williams published an autobiography entitled A Child of the Sea and My Life Among Mormons.  Later life  Williams retired in 1913 and moved to Charlevoix with her husband where they spent 25 years in quiet retirement. Williams died, 12 hours after her husband, on January 23, 1938.  Legacy  Williams is one of America's longest-serving lighthouse keepers with 41 years of service. Her autobiography continues to provide insight into women's experiences in the Great Lakes region and remains in print. A children's book, Elizabeth Whitney Williams and The Little Traverse Light, is based upon Williams' life.

Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the eastern aspect of the mountain rises from sea level at Blackstone Bay in Prince William Sound. The peak's nearest higher peak is Isthmus Peak, to the south, and nearby Bard Peak lies northeast. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1959 by the United States Geological Survey. The 1959 first ascent party of Keith Hart, Ted Barrett, and Mat Nitsch suggested the name as a tribute to the Carpathian Mountains back in Mat's homeland which at the time was behind the Iron Curtain, with the intention to create a symbol of freedom. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Carpathian Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports the Skookum Glacier on the west side, Portage Glacier to the north, and the Spencer Glacier on its south and east aspects.

Paul Hunter. Hunter gives an account of the many non-fictional sources that led to the rise of the English novel, many of them non-literary. Overview Hunter argues that to understand the eighteenth-century English novel, we must understand the \\"pasts and traditions\\" from which the novel emerged, including journalism, occasional meditations, the related genres of Wonder books and Providence books, private diaries, didactic works, and travel narratives. Hunter gives a detailed history of the nature of these various types of works that helped foster the rise of the novel, and he explains the roles of writers, booksellers, and other people who ushered the English novel into existence. Reception Before Novels was highly praised in the academic press, where it was widely reviewed. Bridget Fowler in The British Journal of Sociology wrote, \\"If, as Hunter claims, the novel's imaginative form transcends its source, his research on the precise nature of that source is highly illuminating.\\" Fowler went on to say that Hunter \\"makes such a good case for the important consequences of the role of the collective consciousness in the consumption of popular writing and novels, and especially its decisive impact in the initial dispute with the Augustans. His conclusion, then, is compelling. Rather than the work of a humanist elite, he asserts that it was 'the energies of popular culture (which) arrested the literary tradition from its conservative guardians'.\\" Julia V. Douthwaite, writing in Harvard Book Review, hailed Before Novels as \\"a masterful attempt to synthesize the social, religious and economic forces which characterized English culture.... Hunter emphasizes the links between canonical \\"Literature\\" and the texts of popular culture‚Äînewspaper advice columns, vocational how-to books, personal diaries, and Protestant pedagogical tracts. He argues that the novels of Swift, Fielding and Richardson address the same hopes, fears and anxieties previously addressed by these second-rate \\"paraliterary\\" texts.\\" Mark Spilka in Novel: A Forum on Fiction called Before Novels \\"a long-awaited magnum opus from a wise, honorable, sophisticated, and amazingly informed expounder of the novel's rise and of the newly exciting age which made it possible. Though not as revolutionary as Watt's classic study, Hunter's multivalent, standard-setting volume will serve handsomely as its critical and cultural equivalent for our own exciting times.\\" D. E. Richardson in The Sewanee Review was laudatory in his review: \\"Hunter campaigns, on behalf of the New Historicism, against what he calls traditional literary history. His tone is fervent and adversarial, as if it were morally imperative for the reader to adopt his critical perspectives. Since something very important seems to be at stake, the reader would like Hunter to provide a theoretical statement of the issues that divide old and new literary history, but instead the reader has to deduce it. What emerges in Hunter's book as the New Historicism is the project of placing literary works in their historical context in an engag√© politically progressivist way. Texts are to be read as scenes of social conflict and the New Historicist critic is to advocate the progressive side.\\" Margaret Anne Doody, writing in the South Atlantic Review, observed that \\"[t]he strength of Before Novels lies in its treatment of what is usually offered merely as \\"background\\" to studies of the novel in general or to the study of particular novels. There is nothing here of much interest on any one novel or novelist. Despite Hunter's initial claim to have read numbers of the novels of the period, he does not offer us many examples aside from the best-known works of major authors. We get references to Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders, Tom Jones, Clarissa‚Äîbut little real reference to or quotations from other fictional works by other writers.\\" Jeffrey Smitten, discussing the book in The Review of English Studies, stated that \\"there is little question that Hunter has written a superb book‚Äîone that will exert a major impact on the study of the origins of the novel and of eighteenth-century literature generally. He has effected a Copernican revolution by shifting the centre of energy in the period from the conservative tradition of Dryden, Swift, and Pope to the inventive, dynamic, and ultimately one consisting of figures that the Augustans feared and loathed‚Äîthe likes of Dunton, Cibber, Manly, and Defoe. We are in many ways more the descendants of the latter tradition than the former, and Hunter's excellent book enables us to move beyond the traditional canon to begin to explore the implications of a parentage that has been too easily denied.\\" Frank McConnell, reviewing Before Novels alongside Alvin Kernan's The Death of Literature in The Wilson Quarterly, wrote that \\"Hunter's depiction of the newly enfranchised 18th-century audiences would not make a bad description of the novelty-mad, tradition-ignoring, postmodern television mutants whom Kernan et al. regard as the pallbearers of 'humanism's long dream of learning.' It is ironic that Hunter, by far the more donnish of the two critics, should be the one to remind us that the barbarians at the gates are really only our children.\\" References Sources  Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"Before Novels"},{"id":"61028447","text":"Albert Fearing Hayden (May 5, 1865 ‚Äì April 21, 1962) was an American judge who presided over the sentencing of people arrested during the May Day riots of 1919.

May Day riots of 1919 The May Day riots of 1919 were a series of violent demonstrations that occurred throughout Cleveland, Ohio on May 1 (May Day), 1919. The riots occurred during the May Day parade organized by Socialist leader Charles Ruthenberg, of local trade unionists, socialists, communists, and anarchists to protest against the conviction of Eugene V. Debs. One of those arrested during the riots was William James Sidis. Sidis had graduated from Harvard University at the age of 15. Judge Albert F. Hayden in the Roxbury Municipal Court presided over his case. During the testimony Sidis was quoted as saying that he is a Socialist, a believer in the soviet form of government, that he believed in evolution, that he does not believe in a god, that his god is evolution, and that he believes in our form of government to the extent of the Declaration of Independence. Sidis and 11 other persons who were arrested during the May Day riots in Roxbury were given jail sentences, the so-called Harvard prodigy getting a year and a half. During sentencing Hayden raged against the perceived foreign threat behind the riots, \\" foreigners who think they can get away with their doctrines in this country ‚Ä¶ if I could have my way I would send them and their families back to the country from which they came.\\" 1919 United States anarchist bombings The 1919 United States anarchist bombings were a series of bombings and attempted bombings carried out by the Italian anarchist followers of Luigi Galleani from April through June 1919.

The Hayden family was on vacation at the time and only the Judge's son Malcolm Hayden was in town. The bomb which exploded just before midnight on June 2, 1919, nearly destroyed the home. The son while walking home saw a car speed away and then the explosion. Death Hayden died on April 21, 1962, at Jordan Hospital in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Darnton maps the \\"forbidden sector\\" of eighteenth-century French literature, using archival records that showed the popularity of forbidden books including pornography, utopian literature, and a popular genre of slanderous political works. Overview Darnton traces the channels of the eighteenth-century French underground book trade using archival records preserved from the Soci√©t√© Typographique de Neuch√¢tel, a publisher and wholesaler that supplied books and pamphlets to the French market from the Swiss principality of Neuch√¢tel. Darnton discusses the nature of the forbidden works, the reasons for their popularity, and the role they played in French literary, social, and political life. The forbidden works included pornographic novels, utopian works, and the genre of political slander. Darnton's text includes numerous charts and illustrations that support his argument. Darnton concludes his essay by speculating about the role the dissemination of these forbidden texts may have played in setting the stage for the French Revolution. Reception The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France was widely reviewed in the academic press. Mark Curran, writing in The Historical Journal, praised Darnton, saying \\"Robert Darnton's contributions to the fields of pre-revolutionary French history, book history, sociology, the history of ideas and, more recently, digital humanities have been profound and inspirational.\\" Curren went on to summarize the reasons for the book's importance. \\"Robert Darnton's acclaimed 1995 work on the late eighteenth-century illegal book trade, The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, has become one of the most cited and studied texts in its field. The culmination of thirty years' archival reflection, it roots Darnton's previous case-study-driven articles and monographs in a wide- ranging empirical survey of the order books of the Swiss printer-booksellers, the Soci√©t√© Typographique Neuch√§tel. It claims to offer readers a picture of what illegal books went into bookshops everywhere in pre-revolutionary France.\\" Jack R. Censer in The American Historical Review gave the book high praise. \\"Superbly and boldly written, this book is an important statement by a very eminent scholar,\\" Censer wrote. \\"[M]any basic issues are delineated and debated with exceptional grace and clarity; much valuable information is presented; specialists and non-specialists will profit by viewing and evaluating it.\\" Katherine Gantz in The Antioch Review described the book's merits as follows: \\"Darnton's provocative work looks beyond the canon, to a potent, yet rarely studied source of cultural information: the issues and interests contained in books banned by the Old Regime, but actively circulated in the illegal book market. Blasphemous philosophical tracts, pornographic novels, and anti-monarchist political essays all contributed to this body of forbidden literature.\\" Gantz concluded: \\"Darnton's deft approach to his subject combines the rigors of historical research with a useful materialist analysis of the publishing trade.\\" Malcolm Cook in The Modern Language Review wrote that \\"without his pioneering work over a period of about twenty-five years, our knowledge of the book trade in the final years of the ancien regime would be little indeed.\\" Cook went on to say, \\"Darnton claims that his objective is 'understanding the demand for forbidden books and the means of transmitting and satisfying it.' There is no doubt, in my opinion, that this objective is achieved.\\" Jeremy D. Popkin in The Journal of Modern History, noting the importance of Darnton's earlier work on the same topic, expressed reservations about Darnton's achievement in Forbidden Best-Sellers. \\"The print culture of eighteenth-century France was too extensive and too diverse to allow us to single out any one element as decisive in causing the Revolution. Few scholars have done as much over the years to alert us to the extent of that diversity as Robert Darnton. Forbidden Best-Sellers, rather than extending and synthesizing his earlier work, seems to turn its back on Darnton's own most original insights and the findings that other scholars inspired by his work have come to.\\" John Lough in Romanische Forschungen concluded \\"One may greatly admire Darnton's brilliant researches into the underground book trade without being able to accept some of the conclusions which he draws from them.\\" See also * French Revolution * Utopian and dystopian fiction * Libertine novel References Sources  Category:1996 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France"},{"id":"61028497","text":"Libertine Enlightenment: Sex, Liberty and Licence in the Eighteenth Century is a 2003 book edited by Peter Cryle and Lisa O'Connell.

I find this timely.\\" Michael McKeon, writing in Studies in English Literature praised the book for its eclectic approach: \\"Libertine Enlightenment ... mixes methods of criticism, moving back and forth between theoretical synthesis, textual analysis, and biographical story- telling, the latter two predominating. What unites these styles of procedure is a fairly common thickness of circumstantial detail, briefly immersing the reader in a world and a demimonde that seem only rather more strange than they do familiar McKeon went on to say: > Cryle and O'Connell's aim is to get away from the focus less on thinkers > than on conventionally 'great' thinkers, and in sympathy with this aim they > also would replace the idea of the 'Enlightenment' by the idea of 'multiple > enlightenments.' However, this endorsement of the multiple over the > monolithic is quickly qualified by the further thought that 'libertine > enlightenment(s?)' might do as well as any single term to capture the > totality, so long as we understand that 'libertinism‚Äîthe self-aware, > philosophically oriented practice of more or less sexualized freedom‚Äîmerges > into libertinage‚Äîthe vernacular, dissident freedoms of everyday life.' Adam Rounce in The Cambridge Quarterly commented on the misleading title of the book: \\"this essay collection inverts the old-fashioned idea of hiding erotica under a dull and pious title, so that politics and liberty get equal attention with sex.\\" Rounce did offer qualified praise for the book, stating that despite its unevenness, \\"the best parts ... would stand very well on their own, while some of the others would benefit from less rigidity.\\" Kevin L. Cope, writing in Eighteenth-Century Life, reviewed Libertine Enlightenment alongside Sophie Carter's Purchasing Power: Representing Prostitution in Eighteenth-Century English Popular Print Culture and Frances Ferguson's Pornography, the Theory. Cope called Libertine Enlightenment \\"most ambitious and successful of the three ... Libertine Enlightenment ... expands the standard concept of the place of Enlightenment.\\" However, Cope found Libertine Enlightenment, as well as the two other books under review, diminished by a certain timidity in addressing their topics: \\"All three of these books suffer from a pervasive nervousness, whether a highly professional concern to please the aging power-brokers of our profession or a quiet tension about taking up the tawdry side of life as one‚Äôs topic in a 'tenure' book or an affected trembling about the injustices of sex in the exploitative city or some other form of hypertrophic worry. These books remind readers that the long eighteenth century may well be larger than our wits (or our lusts) and that its seeming preoccupation with sexuality may only symptomatize its vivacity.\\" See also * Libertine novel References Sources  * Category:Books about literature Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Books about literary theory ","title":"Libertine Enlightenment"},{"id":"61028508","text":"The 1930 St. Xavier Musketeers football team was an American football team that represented Xavier University as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) during the 1930 college football season.

Life and work  His father was an acupuncturist. He completed his primary education at the Tokyo \\"British School\\". His artistic education began at a private school in Tokyo operated by Kawakami T≈çgai, then he took lessons at the Technical Fine Arts School (now the Tokyo Institute of Technology), operated by the Ministry of Industry. There, he came under the influence of the Italian artist, Antonio Fontanesi, head of the painting classes, who was instrumental in introducing Western style painting to Japan. During his military service, he also studied watercolor painting with the French artist, under the auspices of the Ministry of the Army. Two of his younger brothers pursued military careers. When Fontanesi returned to Italy in 1878, Koyama was dissatisfied with his replacement and left the school. Together with some friends, he founded the \\"Association of the Eleventh\\" (ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊ¨°‰ºö), so called because that was the eleventh year of the Meiji era.

Each of the candidates for this grueling selection process are given a 'withdrawal at own request' form to exit the program at a time of their choosing, and the form is carried in their pocket during training.

History  = Russian Eastern Orthodoxy in the region = After the visit of Metropolitan Kirill (Gundyaev) of Smolensk and Kaliningrad to Malaysia and Singapore in 2003, the development of Russian Orthodox communities in these countries begun. In 2009, Bishop Sergius (Chashin) noted: \\"Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia, while still Chairman of the Department for External Church Relations, visited many countries of Southeast Asia a few years ago: Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and others. During this trip, he repeatedly met with our compatriots. Each time they asked him to create Eastern Orthodox communities where they could gather and pray. Metropolitan Kirill understood perfectly well how important it was to not forget and support Russians living outside their home country in every possible way. But, apparently, the time has not yet come at that time. It was unclear what to do first and what to do next\\" On October 12, 2007, the newly formed parish in honor of the Assumption of the Mother of God in Singapore was accepted into the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church entrusted archpastoral care of the parish to Bishop Sergius (Chashin) of Ussuriysk, vicar of the Vladivostok diocese. Since 2009, the clergy of the Assumption parish in Singapore began to celebrate regular services in the premises of the Russian Center for Science and Culture in Kuala Lumpur. In 2012, the parish of the Russian Orthodox Church, named after Archangel Michael moved to its permanent place in the center of the Malaysian capital. On December 26, 2012, by the decision of the Holy Synod, Bishop Sergius was entrusted with the archpastoral care of that parish. On November 13, 2018 in Singapore, a solemn ceremony was held for the laying of the first foundation stone of the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin which will be built on the territory of the Russian Cultural Center. = Creation within the PESEA = On December 28, 2018, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church formed the Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia (PESEA), with its headquarter in Singapore. Archbishop Sergius (Chashin), was appointed as primate of the newly created Exarchate, with the title \\"of Singapore and South-East Asia\\" On 7 January 2019, he was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan in connection with the latter's appointment as exarch. The newly established PESEA was not divided into dioceses until February 2019 and therefore de facto was until February 2019 a single diocese. On February 26, 2019, the Holy Synod of the ROC formed the diocese of Singapore within the Republic of Singapore, the Republic of Indonesia and Malaysia, 3 other dioceses of the PESEA were also created. On 2 November 2019, the clergy of the Indonesian mission of the ROCOR, formerly part of the ROCOR Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, decided to come under the unified spiritual leadership of the Diocese of Singapore due to the lack of ROCOR diocesan structures in Indonesia and on the basis of pastoral considerations.

Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the southern aspect of the mountain rises from the sea-level Harriman Fiord of Prince William Sound. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1910 by the United States Geological Survey, probably after conservationist John Muir (1838-1914) who visited the Alaska area four times, including as a member of the 1899 Harriman Alaska expedition that explored this immediate area.

They were wrestlers from King Rajnarayan Roy (1756-1770) and were from an impoverished family. During that time, there was no treatment for cholera so when the infection spread through the area, both Hinu and Dinu fell ill. They prayed to the Goddess Kali (also called Goddess of war) and asked for healing, promising to worship her. After several days, the two brothers became fully cured. However, they could not afford to make a temple or make arrangements for worship. The two brothers were from the Bagdi community. Traditionally the Bagdi were hunters and gatherers. They were also one of the most prominent warrior clans in old British India. During the British rule in India, many bands of Bagdis participated in criminal activities and consequently declared criminal tribes by the British. The two brothers Hinu and Dinu committed robberies to serve their ‚ÄòManat‚Äô (oath). As a memorial, there are now formal robbery practices that take place before the worship. As the first worship was held in the field of ‚ÄòBegunbari‚Äô (Brinjle garden), it is called the Kali Puja of ‚ÄòBegunbari‚Äô. Now the entire village is called ‚ÄòBegunbari‚Äô https://rupeshsamanta.blogspot.com/2018/06/50-years-old-begunbari- kali-puja.html Architecture A replica of the Dakshineswar Kali Temple was built after the original temple was destroyed.

It is a cultural festival commemorated by all Ashantis though the cultural events take place at Kumawu. The festival is used in commemorating the bravery and self-sacrificial spirit of their great ancestor, Nana Tweneboa Kodua (I) who is purported to have offered his life to be sacrificed to assist the Ashantis in defeating the Gyamans who were their criminal overloads.  Historical background  The festival is commemorated to mark the historical event that happened in the lives of the Ashanti Kingdom during the reign of Otumfuo Osei Tutu I. Oral tradition among the people of Kumawu has been that the Gyamans who were the overloads of the Ashantis kept on harassing them, forcefully taking their lands, farms, wives and other properties. As a result, the first Ashanti King, Otumfuo Osei Tutu I made a giant effort in uniting the seven Akan clans to fight for their freedom from the Gyamans. After a spiritual inquiry from the Akan deities and ancestors by the then spiritual leader and counsellor for Otumfuo Osei Tutu I, Okomfo Anokye, it was revealed that the Ashantis could gain victory over the Gyamans only after one of the chiefs sacrifice his life. Out of great patriotism and courage, Nana Tweneboa Kodua I willingly stood up and told the Ashanti king that he was prepared to die to aid the newly formed Ashanti kingdom to gain their independence from the Gyamans. After the sacrificial death of Nana Tweneboa Kodua I, the Ashanti army gained victory over the Gyamans as it was spiritually prophesized by Okomfo Anokye. His death being considered as the spiritual strength for the liberation of the Ashanti kingdom from the Gyamans, the King of Ashanti, Otumfuo Osei Tutu I ordered that every year, a festival should be celebrated to remember this great deed of Nana Tweneboa Kodua I. More importantly, the festival is used to educate society members the need to demonstrate patriotism, courage, and selfless spirit required for the development of the Ghanaian society.  Observance  In the eve of the festival, special propitiatory are performed on the blackened stools that are believed to repositories for the souls of all the deceased Ashanti kings kept in the Nkonyafie. Also, sacrifices are performed at particular spots in the Bomfobiri wildlife sanctuary and waterfalls where the Kumawu ancestors are believed to reside. These sacrifices are performed to inform the ancestors of the festival to be commemorated and more significantly to beckon for their spiritual guidance, assistance and presence for a successful festival observance. After the pacification and propitiatory rites to the ancestors are performed, a contest of bravery is held at the chief's palace or at any designated area where the festival durbar is held. A big cow is slaughtered. The dead cow is placed in an open arena where the festival durbar is been held amidst thousand of Kumawu residents, people from neighbouring Ashanti towns and villages as well as visitors. A path is created that leads to where the slaughtered cow lies where courageous individuals are made to cut a piece of the animal and run with it to a designated spot amidst several beatings from the crowd holding whips. If an individual is able to cut a part of the slaughtered cow and is able to send it to the designated spot despite the beatings, he is judged as courageous and brave. He takes possession of the cut cow meat and is awarded by the Kumawu chief. Other contests such as food contests, dancing and singing competitions, beauty pageant as well as environmental cleansing and tree planting activities are carried out during the festival commemoration.

The year-end issues have been published every January since 1986, adopting the current \\"Rewind\\" title in 1997. Each year-end issue has included an annual critics' poll, collating critics' ballots into a list of the year's best releases. The polls survey writers affiliated with the magazine. Across its history, critics' polls in The Wire have tended to reflect the magazine's eclectic, avant-garde sensibility and coverage of experimental music across a broad variety of genres. The magazine's first few polls were limited to selecting the best jazz LP of the year, in accordance with its original focus on jazz music. As the magazine's coverage expanded it began incorporating other lists of the best albums in selected non-jazz genres, but kept the jazz poll at the centre. In 1990 the magazine had its first all-genre poll, and the following year the main poll opened to include albums from any musical genre. Beginning in 2011, the main poll expanded to encompass not only albums, but any musical release of any length in any conceivable format. Nevertheless, the poll has typically continued to emphasise releases from the album format above all others. History The American avant-garde jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman topped The Wires poll in two consecutive years. =1985‚Äì1991: jazz era= American jazz pianist Cecil Taylor (pictured at right) placed first in the 1988 poll and, in 1990, received a \\"special accolade\\" for a box set that would have otherwise topped the poll. In 1991, German electronic group Kraftwerk topped the magazine's first all-genre poll. The early polls were limited to jazz albums, mirroring the magazine's focus at that time, but the purview gradually expanded; by 1990, the main jazz list was published alongside lists for blues, Latin music, \\"composition\\" (i.e., classical music) and \\"suspect rock\\" (i.e., experimental rock). The magazine published an all-genre poll for the first time in 1991, a so-called \\"open vote 'beyond' category\\" that was still subordinate to the \\"main\\" list of jazz and improvised releases. The Mix, a remix album by German electronic group Kraftwerk, was the first release to top an all-genre poll. =1992‚Äì2010: Record of the Year= Arrested Development topped the critics' poll in 1992, the first year that the magazine placed an all-genre list ahead of its jazz list. With three albums named Record of the Year, English musician Robert Wyatt has topped The Wires poll more than any other artist. Two-time poll-topper Bj√∂rk (pictured), an Icelandic musician, is one of the only artists from outside the Anglosphere to win the poll. The others are Kraftwerk and Mouse on Mars, both from Germany. American rock band Sonic Youth topped the magazine's poll twice. In 1992, The Wire stopped privileging its jazz poll and instead began to designate its all- genre poll as its primary year-end list. The blurb accompanying that year's poll announced that the \\"main chart takes the form of an all-inclusive, open- ended category‚Äîcontributors were asked to vote for their favourite records across all genres, from jazz to Techno, opera to Africa, metal to Minimalism.\\" The magazine continued to publish genre-specific lists, including for jazz. In 1993, The Wire started calling its all-genre poll the \\"Record of the Year\\". =2011‚Äìpresent: Release of the Year= American musician James Ferraro's Far Side Virtual was the first winner of the expanded \\"Release of the Year\\" poll. In 2011, The Wire switched the name of its annual critics' poll from Records of the Year to Releases of the Year. The change meant that critics could cast votes for \\"any self-contained audio entity, be it a vinyl LP, 12\\" EP, cassette, CD, download, mixtape, etc.\\" Editor-in-chief Tony Herrington explained the reasoning and observed how it had changed critics' submissions: The cover design for the 2017 Rewind‚Äîpublished January 2018, issue number 407‚Äîwas a work of interactive audiovisual art. Using a custom augmented reality app, a smart device's camera would show the abstract magazine cover as a three-dimensional, with accompanying audio. The project was cited in the 2019 book The Fundamentals of Graphic Design as \\"an immersive and dynamic experience perfectly reflecting the publication's long-running championing of experimental approaches to making and performing music.\\" Critics' polls { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Artist ! scope=\\"col\\"  Album ! scope=\\"col\\"  Musical genre ! scope=\\"col\\"  Nation ! scope=\\"col\\"  Poll name ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1985  Decode Yourself  Avant-garde jazz  rowspan=\\"8\\" align=\\"center\\"  US  rowspan=\\"2\\"  align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1986  Song X  Avant-garde jazz  align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1987  In All Languages  Avant-garde jazz  rowspan=\\"2\\"  align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1988  Live in Bologna  Avant-garde jazz  align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1989  Ming's Samba  Avant-garde jazz  align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  1990  Time on My Hands  Avant-garde jazz  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\"  Cecil Taylor in Berlin '88  Avant-garde jazz -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  1991  Lost and Found  Avant-garde jazz  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\"-style=\\"height:3.5em;\\"  Kraftwerk  Electronic  align=\\"center\\"  DEU -style=\\"height:3.5em;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1992  Arrested Development  3 Years, 5 Months and 2 Days in the Life Of...

Life Brisson was born in a small agricultural village in Qu√©bec in 1946. All his education was received in the ecclesiastically administered and staffed schools, seminaries, and universities of Qu√©bec. At the end of the sixties he joined the general movement of Qu√©bec students to Paris, where he undertook a thesis on the Timaeus of Plato, under the direction of Cl√©mence Ramnoux at Paris X Nanterre. During 1971-1972 he was a visiting scholar at Balliol College, Oxford. His studies include several years of Sanskrit. Upon the completion of his Ph.D. thesis, and through the support of Jean P√©pin, who shared his interest in the ancient treatment of myth, Brisson was attached to the CNRS in 1974.

Life and art  Born in Odessa, Ukraine. After completing middle school Skoptsov proceeded to work as a metalworker. At the same time Skoptsov started drawing and illustrating. He served in the USSR Airforce and at the conclusion of his military service attempted to enter into arts major programs in Odessa and Moscow. During his attempt at formal education, Konstantin discovered that the subject matter requirements imposed by the Communist Party contradicted with his artistic vision and personal beliefs. He therefore abandoned his efforts towards a college degree and instead joined the growing underground movement of young and politically independent artists. His first public exhibitions started in 1976, mostly in the apartment galleries hosted by private art collectors, accessible by invitation only. Today, his works are displayed throughout the world, in major galleries and museums. In 2000 Skoptsov was introduced to his future mentor, Temistokl Vyrsta, a renowned French abstractionist. This relationship had marked an important milestone in the artist's career as he became a representative of the French Art Association Fenix and established a large presence in Paris, in collaboration with the art project Paris School of Ukrainian Painting. In 2004, Skoptsov received a recognition award by Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John for his illustrations to Henri de R√©gnier. Concurrently he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Russian-Italian Academy Ferroni for illustrations to Dante Alighieri, as well as an essay on Giotto di Bondone's frescoes at the La Basilica di San Francesco d'Assisi. Skoptsov develops and promotes his signature Semantic Realism style and uses a variety of media for his artistic inspirations, from canvas and paper to natural leather. He considers such Masters of drawing and painting as Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Hieronymus Bosch to be an inspiration and predecessors of Semantic Realism. Based on his own interviews and similarity in themes and style, he is frequently referred to as \\"Bosch From Odessa\\" by the Ukrainian media. Currently, Konstantin Skoptsov lives and works in his home city of Odessa, continuing collaborations with international galleries and museums.  Quotes  * About Drawing and Painting: ‚ÄúLine expresses everything permanent, while color ‚Äì transient. The line, reigning this world, determines everything ‚Äì it is a solely abstract symbol: Line reflect both character of the subject and unity of narrative. Line defines the whole atmosphere and fixates your feelings. Reality here can only serve as a starting point for Art to travel to the place where Idea dwells ‚ÄúClothed in sensual form‚Äù. * About Underground: ‚ÄúTrue art was and always will be an outsider, staying beyond the limits of the aquarium of art life and always remote from the crafty art feeder. It is the ‚Äúsalt‚Äù, without it art becomes bland, it is the ‚Äúcut‚Äù of the diamond, and as defined by Jean Cocteau, reflects artistic aristocracy. Only when we look at the pieces created by such artists as Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Modigliani, cast out by contemporaries, we see deeply into fundamental reasoning of art‚Äù.  Quotes about him  * By Russian Art Critic Stanislav Aidenyan: \\"His [Konstantin Skoptsov's] name is among the most talented graphic artists in Odessa. Konstantin is an artist and a poet, though also is known to be a kind of a philosopher, a thinker who encourages submerging into the subconscious mind.

After adjusting for inflation, average published tuition at public (4-year, in-state) and private non-profit universities has increased by 178% and 98%, respectively, from the 1990‚Äì91 school year to 2017‚Äì18. Net Price (tuition less aid received) has also grown, but to a much smaller degree, as most universities have increased their \\"discount rate\\" by offering more in student aid. After adjusting for inflation, average net price at public and private universities has increased by 77% and 17%, respectively, over the same time frame. A report in The Economist criticized American universities for generally losing sight of how to contain costs. Analyst Jeffrey Selingo in The Chronicle of Higher Education blamed rising costs on unnecessary amenities such as private residence rooms, luxury dining facilities, climbing walls, and sometimes even so-called lazy rivers similar to ones found in amusement parks.NPR Staff, interview with Jeffrey J. Selingo, with David Greene, May 8, 2013, With Gorgeous Dorms But Little Cash, Colleges Must Adapt, Accessed May 9, 2013 Amenities such as a lazy river at a dorm at the University of North Florida are reputed to be driving up costs for undergraduate education. Another issue is the rising cost of textbooks. There are textbook exchanges for students who will accept a used text at a lower price. Lower priced alternatives offered by Flat World Knowledge are now available but have yet to make a significant impact on overall textbook prices. One explanation posits that tuition increases simply reflect the increasing costs of producing higher education due to its high dependence upon skilled labor. According to the theory of the Baumol effect, a general economic trend is that productivity in service industries has lagged that in goods-producing industries, and the increase in higher education costs is simply a reflection of this phenomenon. Some universities describe being caught in a dilemma where they are pressured to offer broader curricula and improve facilities to attract new students on one hand, but on the other hand these universities must raise tuition to compensate for state spending cuts and rising expenses. Annual undergraduate tuition varies widely from state to state, and many additional fees apply. Listed tuition prices generally reflect the upper bound that a student may be charged for tuition. In many cases, the \\"list price\\" of tuition ‚Äì that is, the tuition rate broadcast on a particular institution's marketing platforms ‚Äì may turn out to be different from the actual (or net) tuition charged per student. A student that has applied for institution-based funding will know his or her net tuition upon receipt of a financial aid package. Since tuition does not take into account other expenses such as the cost of living, books, supplies and other expenses, such additional amounts can cause the overall cost of college to exceed the tuition rate multiplied by the number of courses the student is planning to take. In 2009, average annual tuition at a public university (for residents of the state) was $7,020. Tuition for public school students from outside the state is generally comparable to private school prices, although students can often qualify for state residency after their first year. Private schools are typically much higher, although prices vary widely from \\"no-frills\\" private schools to highly specialized technical institutes. Depending upon the type of school and program, annual graduate program tuition can vary from $15,000 to as high as $50,000. Note that these prices do not include living expenses (rent, room/board, etc.) or additional fees that schools add on such as \\"activities fees\\" or health insurance. These fees, especially room and board, can range from $6,000 to $12,000 per academic year (assuming a single student without children).\\"Tuition Levels Rise but Many Students Pay Significantly Less than Published Rates\\" . The College Board (2003). URL accessed on June 20, 2005 Such fees are not at all government-regulated, allowing a theoretically enormous increase each year. While tuition is monitored to some degree in legislatures and is often publicly discussed, fees on the side are frequently overlooked in public opinion and regulatory policies. Although tuition costs have risen, the rising costs have had little effect on transfer rates and overall enrollment. In a study on effects of rising tuition costs, analysis revealed that the rising costs of colleges have \\"weak or no effects\\" on enrollment. Rising tuition costs have not deterred enrollment \\"as long as students believe the potential return of a college education is much greater than the cost\\". Study comparing college revenue per student by tuition and state funding in 2008 dollars.\\"Trends in College Spending 1998‚Äì2008 \\" Delta Cost Project. College costs are rising while state appropriations for aid are shrinking. This has led to debate over funding at both the state and local levels. From 2002 to 2004 alone, tuition rates at public schools increased by just over 14%, largely due to dwindling state funding. A more moderate increase of 6% occurred over the same period for private schools. Between 1982 and 2007, college tuition and fees rose three times as fast as median family income, in constant dollars. In the 2012 fiscal year, state and local financing declined to $81.2 billion, a drop in funding compared to record-high funding in 2008 of $88 billion in a pre-recession economy. To combat costs colleges have hired adjunct professors to teach. In 2008 these teachers cost about $1,800 per 3-credit class as opposed to $8,000 per class for a tenured professor. Two-thirds of college instructors were adjuncts, according to one estimate; a second estimate from NBC News in 2013 was that 76% of college professors were in \\"low-paying, part-time jobs or insecure, non-tenure positions,\\" often lacking health insurance.Barbara Raab, Senior Producer, NBC News, April 9, 2013 Meet your new professor: Transient, poorly paid, Accessed April 9, 2013 There are differences of opinion on whether these adjuncts teach more or less effectively than regular tenured or tenure-track professors. There is some suspicion that student evaluation of adjuncts, along with doubts on the part of teachers about subsequent continued employment, can lead to grade inflation. Princeton sociologists Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford published a book-length study of admissions that found that an upper-middle-class white applicant was three times as likely to be admitted to an American college as a lower-class white with similar qualification. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has cited this as an example of how U.S. universities can exacerbate wealth inequality. A 2006 report by Future of Children, a collaboration of Princeton and the Brookings Institution, concluded that \\"the current process of admission to, enrollment in, and graduation from colleges and universities contributes to economic inequality as measured by income and wealth.\\"The Role of Higher Education in Social Mobility . Robert Haveman and Timothy Smeeding. Opportunity in America Volume 16 Number 2 Fall 2006 According to Suzanne Mettler of Cornell, government policy towards higher education has an effect of deepening inequality and disadvantaging students from the lower classes.Seth Freed Wessler, May 16, 2014, NBC News, Great Unequalizer: Is Higher-Education Policy Making Inequality Worse?, Accessed May 19, 2014 Athletics have been increasingly subsidized by tuition. Fewer than one in eight of the 202 NCAA Division I colleges netted more money than they spent on athletics between 2005 and 2010. At the few money-making schools, football and sometimes basketball sales support the school's other athletic programs. Athletes, on average, cost six times what it cost to educate the non-athlete. Spending per student varied from $10,012 to $19,225; while the spending per athlete varied from $41,796 to $163,931. = Issues related to financial aid = The portion of state budget funding spent on higher education decreased by 40% from 1978 to 2011, while most tuition fees significantly increased over the same period. Between 2000 and 2010, the cost of tuition and room and board at public universities increased by 37%. There is a misconception that there was no similar increase in financial aid to help cover the costs of tuition. This is incorrect. In 1965, $558 million was available for financial aid. In 2005 more than $129 billion was available. As college costs have risen, so has the amount of money available to finance a college education. However, the proportion of gift aid and self-help funding has shifted: loans and work make up a larger percentage of aid packages. During the early 1980s, higher education funding shifted from reliance on state and federal government funding to more family contributions and student loans. Pell Grants, which were created to offset the cost of college for low-income students, started funding more middle-class students, stretching the funds thinner for everyone. During the mid-1990s 34% of the cost for college was covered by the maximum offered Pell Grant, compared to 84% during the 1970s. During Clinton's presidency, funding for higher education focused on creating tax benefits tied to attending college. These policies put less emphasis on developing grants to allow students to attend college. Some argued that this approach did not adequately provide aid to those students most in need. There was also a fear that tax deductions or credits would drive up tuition costs. The federal government also began funding fewer grant programs and more loan programs, leaving students with higher amounts of debt. In 2003, almost 70% of federal student aid awarded was student loans, which was a much higher percentage than just a decade prior. the National Center for Education Statistics reported that during the 2007‚Äì08 school year, 66% of degree recipients borrowed money to complete their degree; 36% of these graduates had to borrow from state or private sources, averaging total loan amounts of $13,900; 95% of these loans were private. On average, a student borrowed $24,700 during the 2007‚Äì08 school year. One estimate of total debt of all ex-students in 2011 was $1 trillion. The economic troubles of the recent decade left higher education funding shifted toward other needs because higher education institutions can gain extra funds through raising tuition and private donations. Policy changes in higher education funding raise questions about the impact on student performance and access to higher education. Early studies focused on social integration and a person's individual attributes as the factors for degree completion. More recent studies have begun to look at larger factors including state funding and financial support. It has been found that providing need-based aid proved to increase degree completion in 48 states. There has also been a positive correlation between providing merit- based aid and degree completion. As the level to qualify for state need-based aid is lowered, the probability of persistence increases. Low-income families now must pay more to attend college, making it harder for them to attain higher education. In 1980, low-income families used 13% of their income to pay for one year of college. In 2000, this proportion grew to 25 percent of their income, while high-income families used less than 5% of their income. Fully understanding how need and merit (non-need) aid is determined is critical to ensure greater access to higher education. It is clear that at both private and public colleges and universities family income has a major impact on need- based financial aid. As colleges and universities compete for students, the demarcation between merit-based aid and need-based aid is less clear. While there has been a traditional distinction between need-based and merit-based funding, recent trends indicate that these two categories are more blurred than their labels would suggest. Research confirms that merit-based financial aid often takes into account student need and vice versa. Controversy has also risen regarding performance-based funding. Performance-based funding is a system in which the state's higher education budget is allocated to institutions by several measures to best determine allocation of funds. This system has been criticized due to the complexity of the measurements as well as the resulting changed environment and goals of campuses. Many have criticized performance-funding, noting an overemphasis of test scores without consideration of other possible measures. A 2006 report by Michael S. McPherson and Morton Owen Schapiro indicated that financial aid to students in the 1990s held the strongest correlation with student SAT scores. The report was conducted in the interest of looking directly at the relationship between financial aid grants and various factors, with specific focus on the variables of family income level and SAT scores and minor focus on personal variables, such as race and gender. The reason these factors were given greater consideration was that, according to McPherson and Schapiro, the information was readily available and led to a more meaningful comparison across students than variables like high school GPA. The report also made clear that it ignored the distinctions that universities make between \\"need-based\\" and \\"merit-based\\" aid. McPherson and Schapiro argued, \\"Although it is commonplace to track the importance of merit as opposed to need-based aid based on the responses given by college and university administrators on survey forms, we have argued that the distinction between 'need-based' and 'non-need-based' student grants is a slippery one.\\"Schapiro, Morton and Michael S. McPherson. 2006. \\"Watch What We Do (and Not What We Say).\\" In College Access: Opportunity or Privilege?, edited by McPherson, M.S. & Schapiro, M.O., 49‚Äì73. New York: The College Board The findings in the report indicated that \\"the principle of awarding financial aid strictly in relation to ability to pay is becoming an increasingly less important factor in the distribution of aid in America's private colleges and universities.\\" Some low-income students have to work and study at the same time. This may adversely impact their performance in school. Most discussions on how higher education funding is determined have focused on the economic and demographic influences; however, according to a 2010 study on the relationship between politics and state funding, political factors influence higher education funding. First, as the number of interest groups for higher education in a state grows, so does the amount of money given to higher education. Second, states with a more liberal political ideology give more funding to higher education. Third, governors with more control over the state budget tend to award less money to higher education. Fourth, a more professional state legislature correlates with more funding for higher education. (Professional in here refers to a legislature that acts much as the U.S. Congress does in that members have many staff members and spend more time in session.) Fifth, the more diverse a state population becomes, the less support there will be for higher education funding. = When college does not pay off = One view is that college students go to college to develop skills for a lucrative career. In 2018, however, more than half of institutions left the majority of their students earning less than $28,000‚Äîthe typical salary of a high school graduate. Schools with limited job placement programs, career counseling, and internships are more likely to have limited returns. Paying for college can hurt retirement outcomes for parents of college students. In a Barron's article titled \\"How Your Kids Can Ruin Your Retirement ‚Äî and How to Make Sure They Don't\\", Reshma Kapadia offers advice to parents on how they can ensure that higher education for their children does not result in diminished retirement quality. According to a 2019 Fed survey, \\"two-thirds of graduates with a bachelor's degree or more believed that their educational investment had paid off financially, but only 3 in 10 of those who started but did not complete a degree shared this view.\\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190523b.htm = For-profit schools = From 1972 to 2009, there was rapid growth of for- profit schools. Government funding in 1972 and government deregulation in 1998 fueled a dramatic rise in for-profit college enrollment. Government oversight and scrutiny since 2010 as well as competition from non-profit and public education has led to a dramatic decrease in enrollment. At its peak, The University of Phoenix was the largest U.S. for-profit college, with an enrollment of more than 500,000 students nationwide. Other large institutions included Devry University, ITT Technical Institute, the Art Institutes, Kaplan University, Ashford University, Colorado Technical Institute, Ashford University, Strayer University, Lincoln Tech, and Walden University. Altogether, at their peak, for-profit colleges enrolled about 11% of the students but created approximately 47% of all the student loan defaults. Critics of for-profit colleges have pointed to the heavy dependence on federal loans and grants to students, the low student completion rate, and the inability of the majority of graduates to pay their student loans because they failed to secure high-paying jobs.John Lauerman and Esm√© E. Deprez, \\"Apollo, Education Shares Plunge on Enrollment Outlook\\" Bloomberg October 14, 2010 The National Center for Education Statistics reported a 52% rate of default on student loans at for-profit colleges. = Student loan debt = The amount of debt that students have after graduation has become a major concern, especially given the weak job market after 2008.\\"The Decline of the 'Great Equalizer'\\" Reuters, December 19, 2012\\"For Poor, Leap to College Often Ends in a Hard Fall\\" New York Times, December 22, 2012 Nearly all loans are financed by the federal government at an artificially low rate, but students sometimes obtain private loans (which generally have higher interest rates and start accumulating interest immediately). Several studies and news reports have detailed the effects of student loan debt on reducing first time home buying and child bearing‚Äîand ultimately slowing down the U.S. economy. Some students have turned to prostitution to avoid college debt. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education announced stricter eligibility rules for federal financing of loans to student at for-profit schools, which were experiencing higher default rates. Student loans totaled more than $1.3 trillion, averaging $25,000 each for 40 million debtors. The debtors average age was 33. Forty percent of the debt was owed by people 40 or older. In a 2017 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, the researchers found that 27% of all student loans resulted in default within 12 years. Children in poor families were particularly vulnerable, still maintaining an average balance that was 91% of the original loan. In 2018, a poll by Lake Research Partners and Chesapeake Beach Consulting found \\"an overwhelming concern among voters regarding the level of student debt.\\" The most visible student loan resistance groups in the U.S. are the Debt Collective, Strike Debt, and Student Loan Justice.

Wilson is an evolutionary and computational biologist and assistant professor at Arizona State University who studies the evolution of sex chromosomes.  Personal life and education  Wilson was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and lived there until she was five, then moving to Garland, Texas, then Tempe, Arizona, then to Syracuse, Nebraska. She graduated from Syracuse High School in Nebraska and received her B.S. in Medical Mathematics with Honors in May 2005 from Creighton University under Lance Nielsen. She received her Ph.D. in integrative biology at Pennsylvania State University under her thesis advisor Kateryna Makova in 2011. She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship under Rasmus Nielsen at UC Berkeley in 2014. She was professionally known as Melissa A. Wilson Sayres from 2010 until her divorce from Scott Sayres, a physical chemist, in 2019. Together they have one daughter.  Career  Wilson is an assistant professor of genomics, evolution, and bioinformatics at Arizona State University. There she is PI of the Sex Chromosome Lab, where she studies genome evolution, mutation rate variation, and population history. One finding of her lab is that crossing over between the X and Y chromosomes occurs in some regions of the chromosomes more often than was previously thought. Another discovery is that the Y chromosome is not decreasing in size, which contradicts previously publicised claims that the Y chromosome might disappear. She also discovered evidence of a Y chromosome population bottleneck in human history. Wilson hypothesised that a possible explanation for this was partially cultural, saying \\"‚ÄúInstead of ‚Äòsurvival of the fittest‚Äô in a biological sense, the accumulation of wealth and power may have increased the reproductive success of a limited number of ‚Äòsocially fit‚Äô males and their sons.‚Äù The lab uses the Gila monster as a model organism to understand the evolution of sex chromosomes. As part of her research, she started a crowdfunding campaign which successfully raised over $10,000 to sequence the Gila monster's DNA. She has referred to the animals as \\"cool\\" and \\"lovable.\\" Wilson holds one patent for tumor treatments, and is the developer of several software packages, including XYalign, for accurately aligning sex chromosomes, and TumorSim, for simulating tumor heterogeneity.  Science communication  Wilson is active in public outreach. She is a regular on the ASU \\"Ask a Scientist\\" podcast and has been interviewed by the New York Times, The Atlantic, Smithsonian Magazine, and the Pacific Standard, among others, as an expert on genetics. She has also publicly spoken out against the use of science to justify white supremacy and transphobia, and against the maltreatment of victims of sexual assault.

It was the first time that a private property was taken by eminent domain by the City of New York for use as a shelter for the homeless. The City's action followed a rent dispute between the owner of the building and the City, which leased three of the upper floors of the building that were operated as the Kenton Hotel to house approximately 200 homeless men. Following condemnation by the City, the building became a flophouse before being taken over by Project Renewal as the Kenton Hall Men's Shelter and used as a shelter for homeless men on methadone maintenance. It was named after a radio show, The Great Gildersleeve. Bands who performed at The Great Gildersleeves included The J. Geils Band, Molly Hatchett, Elvis Costello, Hall & Oates, Elvin Bishop, Iggy Pop, Anthrax, Beastie Boys, Public Image Ltd, Sonic Youth, and Blue Angel (featuring Cyndi Lauper).

Early years  Haim Victor Gerson was born on 1 August 1896 in Southport, Lancashire, the son of a fabric merchant.Spartacus Educational Publishers - Victor Gerson =World War I= He joined the British army at the declaration of war and was sent to the Western Front In France and took part in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, he went to Paris where he was a dealer in fine rugs and carpets. He married and had a son, however in the 1930s his wife died and his son was killed in a traffic accident. He then married Giliana Balmaceda, a Chilean-born actress. = World War II = On 18 June 1940 at the signing of the armistice, the couple escaped to England where both joined the Special Operations Executive.The National Archives : HS 9/575/4 - Haim Victor GERSON In May 1941 Balmaceda was the first female SOE agent to be sent to occupied France. She went to Vichy and collected information and administrative documents used in occupied France, such as ration cards, which could be reproduced in London for use by agents on clandestine missions in France.F Section SOE: The Story of the Buckmaster Network. Marcel Ruby, Pen and Sword, 26 Sep 1988 First mission On the night of the 6/7 September 1941 he was parachuted from a Whitley bomber, along with five other agents and landed near the Le Cerisier farm of Auguste Chantraine, Mayor of Tendu. He travelled to Lyon and Marseille, where he assessed the possibility of organising subversive networks in cities. In October, he avoided arrest in Marseille as he was wary of the voice that gave him an appointment by phone, did not go there. He quickly left France and returned to London where he reported on his conclusions on the French willingness to resist the German occupation. Second mission He was sent back in the field to set up a safe escape route through France into Spain. Monument commemorating the landing of Capt. Peter Churchill from HMS Unbroken at Cap d'Antibes on 21 April 1942 In Operation DELAY II Peter Churchill‚Äôs mission was to land four SOE agents on the French Riviera by submarine. On 26 February 1942 Churchill flew from Bristol to Gibraltar with two radio operators, Isidore Newman ¬´Julien¬ª for the URCHIN network and Edward Zeff ¬´Matthieu¬ª for the SPRUCE network, where they were joined by Marcel Clech ¬´Bastien¬ª, radio operator for the AUTOGIRO network, and Victor Gerson ¬´Ren√©¬ª, an SOE agent on a special mission to organise the VIC Escape Line.

Churchill then returned to the submarine and dropped off Clech and Gerson by canoe at Pointe d‚ÄôAgay near Fr√©jus Gerson and Clech went to Lyon where they met Virginia Hall. Gerson gradually built up an escape network to Spain with Lazarus Rachline and Georges Levin, with Th√©r√®se Mitrani in Lyon, Ren√© Feraggi in Marseille, and Jacques Mitterrand in Paris. He also installed groups in Perpignan and Montpellier. He entrusted Rachline to plan for the exfiltration of the eleven agents of the section F from Mauzac, and they escaped successfully on 16 July 1942 and returned in England. On 19/20 August 1943 Gerson returned by plane to England,Hugh Verity, We landed by Moonlight, 2004. and on 14 September returned to France in a Hudson bomber piloted by Henri D√©ricourt. = Operating rules = Gerson imposed strict rules on his members within the VIC escape line: Despite the circuit being penetrated three times by the Gestapo in June and October 1943 and January 1944, in which some members were arrested, the group was able to continue its activities. Gerson was arrested once while travelling on a train between Paris and Lyons, however his cover story was so convincing he was soon released. During the war he was infiltrated into France six times.

Cast   Release  Desi's Looking for a New Girl premiered at the 2000 San Francisco Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.  Reception  Variety critic Dennis Harvey panned the film. He wrote that while the milieu of the film ‚Äì the Latina lesbian culture of San Francisco's Mission District ‚Äì is potentially interesting, the film itself is \\"uneventful and padded even at 68 slim minutes\\" and that it fails \\"to develop any narrative or characters to draw us in.\\" The review in the Chicago Reader was equally harsh, calling the film a \\"long-winded [and] technically clumsy comedy.\\" Reviewer Ted Shen also viewed the film as a missed opportunity for a worthwhile glimpse into the Latina lesbian dating scene. The Curves magazine review, on the other hand, calls the film \\"a fun and uniquely told story of life after a long-term relationship ends.\\" Reviewer Lauren Shiro called the love and support between the characters \\"palpable\\" and \\"very endearing\\", and opined that the storytelling sweeps the viewer in, making \\"you feel very much like a part of the story.\\" The film has been cited in several books and academic papers on Latina and lesbian Latina cultural representation.

The Kokuka Courageous, flagged in Panama and operated by a company based in Japan, and Front Altair, flagged in Marshall Islands and operated by a company based in Norway, were attacked, allegedly with limpet mines or flying objects, sustaining fire damage. American and Iranian military personnel responded and rescued crew members. The attacks took place a month after the similar May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident and on the same day the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe in Iran. Abe was acting as an intermediary between American President Donald Trump and Iranian supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Amid heightened tension between Iran and the United States, the United States blamed Iran for the attacks. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom supported the United States' accusation. Germany has stated that there is \\"strong evidence\\" that Iran was responsible for the attacks, while Japan has asked for more proof of Iran's culpability. Iran denied the accusation, blaming the United States for spreading disinformation and warmongering. In response to the incident, the United States announced on 17 June the deployment of 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East. Background The incident occurred when tensions were high among Iran, the United States, and Saudi Arabia. On 8 May 2018, the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran, reinstating sanctions against their nuclear program and starting a \\"maximum-pressure campaign\\" on Iran. In response, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz to international shipping, which could have a marked effect on the global oil market. The strait is a choke-point through which some 17.2 million barrels are transported each day, nearly 20 percent of global oil consumption. Iran's oil production has hit a historic low as a result of sanctions; yet Saudi Arabia maintained supplies, leaving prices reasonably stable. According to the BBC, U.S. sanctions against Iran \\"have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\\" U.S. President Donald Trump offered to hold talks with Iran regarding their nuclear program and said he was willing to make a deal to remove sanctions and help fix their economy. However, he did not rule out the possibility of a military conflict with Iran. Iran stated that the United States must first return to the nuclear deal before starting any new negotiations. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Iraq started a \\"Tanker War\\" in the Persian Gulf in 1981. Iran started to fight back in 1984 when Iraq ramped up its attacks on Iranian tankers. In 1987 the U.S. launched Operation Earnest Will to protect Kuwaiti tankers against Iranian attacks. On 5 May 2019, National Security Advisor John R. Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the carrier strike group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to \\"send a clear and unmistakable message\\" to Iran following intelligence reports of an Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. On 10 May 2019, The Pentagon announced the deployment of and a battery of Patriot missiles to join their military forces in the Gulf of Oman region. The June 2019 Gulf of Oman incident occurred approximately one month after the May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident, after which an international investigation concluded that four oil tankers from Norway, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates had been targeted through a sophisticated operation placing limpet mines perpetrated by a \\"state actor\\". U.S. intelligence blamed the attacks on Iran, which increased tensions. The two oil tankers damaged in this incident were Front Altair, owned by a Norwegian company, and the Japan-based Kokuka Courageous. The tankers were carrying petroleum products from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Front Altair was carrying naphtha from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and was traveling from Ruwais in the United Arab Emirates to Taiwan. Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol from Jubail, Saudi Arabia and Mesaieed, Qatar, and was headed to Singapore. The incident occurred during a two-day diplomatic visit by Japan's Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe to Iran. Abe was carrying a note from Donald Trump to the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who rejected exchanging messages with Trump, stating \\"I do not see Trump as worthy of any message exchange, and I do not have any reply for him, now or in future\\". According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the targeted ships were carrying \\"Japan-related\\" cargo. Incident U.S. Navy sailors provide aid to the crew of Kokuka Courageous onboard On 13 June 2019, Front Altair and Kokuka Courageous were both transiting the Gulf of Oman heading southeast in international waters. According to the U.S. Navy, a distress call from Front Altair was received at 03:12 GMT (06:12 local time) following an explosion. Eight minutes later, a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone arrived at the site of Front Altair, observing the ship on fire. According to a U.S. official, Iranian vessels were observed by the American drone to approach the two merchant ships. According to the U.S. military, at 03:45 GMT (06:45 local time), a modified SA-7 surface to air missile was fired at the American drone, missing its target. Subsequent to the incident with the drone, an explosion occurred on Kokuka Courageous. According to the U.S. Navy, a distress call from Kokuka Courageous was received at 04:00 GMT (07:00 local time). CPC Corporation, which was contracting Front Altair, reported that it may have been hit by a torpedo at around 04:00 GMT on 13 June. The hull of Kokuka Courageous was reportedly breached above the waterline on the starboard side. Both ships caught fire, but Frontline and Kokuka Sangyo (affiliated to Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company), the respective owners of the two vessels, reported that all crew members from both ships had successfully evacuated. Iranian News Agency (IRNA) initially reported that Front Altair had sunk, but the statement was later denied by a Frontline spokesman. Other reports suggested that the attacks may have involved limpet mines. Iran reported that they had rescued all 44 crew members of both vessels and taken them to Iran. However, the U.S. Navy responded to assist both vessels after the attack and reported having rescued some of the crew. U.S. officials said that the guided missile destroyer rescued 21 crew members from a tugboat that had rescued them from the burning Kokuka Courageous tanker. A Dutch vessel en route to Dubai rescued 21 people, mostly Filipinos, from Kokuka Courageous. This was confirmed by the Dutch shipping company Acta Marine. The 23 crew of Front Altair were first rescued by a nearby South Korean vessel, Hyundai Dubai. The South Korean Hyundai Merchant Marine Company confirmed the rescue and said the vessel later handed over the rescued crew members to an Iranian rescue boat. According to US intelligence reports, shortly after the crews were evacuated, Iranian military boats surrounded the rescue ships and told them to hand over the mariners into their custody. One of the civilian rescue ships eventually complied with this request. The crew of 23 people of the Frontline's Front Altair was transferred to an Iranian navy vessel and disembarked at a local Iranian port, later being transferred to Bandar Abbas. Neither oil tanker was sunk in the attack, despite significant damage. The U.S. Navy later sent another destroyer, , to the location of the incident. Aftermath After the incident, Kokuka Courageous was towed to the port of Kalba in the United Arab Emirates. Dutch firm Boskalis was appointed to salvage both Kokuka Courageous and Front Altair. On 15 June, the crew of Front Altair arrived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on an Iran Air flight from Bandar Abbas, Iran. Robert Hvide Macleod, CEO of Frontline Management said \\"Everyone has been very well cared for in Iran, and everyone is in good shape\\". Kokuka Courageouss 21 crew members were returned to the vessel by the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet after being rescued. Front Altair was towed to the port of Khorfakkan in the United Arab Emirates. Both Kokuka Courageous and Front Altair will have their cargoes unloaded and will be assessed for damages by a specialist team. On 20 June 2019 Iran shot down an American surveillance drone in the Gulf of Oman. Conspiracy theories have been spread regarding the incident. Investigation U.S. Central Command allegedly showing an IRGC patrol boat removing an unexploded limpet mine from Kokuka Courageous Magnet attached to the side of Kokuka Courageous, allegedly left over from the removed limpet mine U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on the day of the incident that Iran was responsible for the attack. He based this assessment on \\"intelligence, the weapons used, the expertise needed\\" and \\"recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping\\". The New York Times reported that experts believe that Iran would carry out such an attack to hit back at the United States while maintaining enough ambiguity to avoid a direct counterattack. The Iranian government, in response, denied any and all responsibility and criticized the accusation. Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan remarked that the U.S. wanted to \\"build international consensus to this international problem\\", partly by declassifying and releasing intelligence. On 13 June, the U.S. military released a video which it said shows members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from the side of Kokuka Courageous at 4.10pm local time. The patrol boat shown in the video matched the model and dimensions of patrol boats used by the Navy of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with an identical chevron pattern, center console, and anti-aircraft gun. Iran called the U.S. accusations that it attacked the ships baseless. On 14 June, the head of the company that owns Kokuka Courageous, Yutaka Katada, stated that the crew members \\"are saying that they were hit by a flying object. They saw it with their own eyes.\\" Then, \\"some crew witnessed a second shot\\". He said he believed the incident could not have been a torpedo attack, because the ship was hit above the waterline, and that he was more likely to believe a penetrating bullet hit it than a mine. He clarified this was \\"just an assumption or a guess.\\" Also on 14 June, the Tasnim News Agency reported that Hormozgan Province's port director stated that early investigations indicated that the fires broke out due to technical reasons and that there is no proof that an external object hit either ship. Iran's United Nations mission issued a statement wherein it called on the United States and its regional allies to \\"put an end to mischievous plots and false flag operations in the region.\\" Analyst Fran√ßois Heisbourg stated \\"There's a lot of suspicion in Europe about American motives. The maritime milieu is especially susceptible to manipulation ‚Äì remember the Gulf of Tonkin.\\" Analyst Anthony Cordesman raised \\"the possibility that ISIS (Daesh) carried out the attack as trigger to turn two enemies ‚Äì the United States and Iran ‚Äì against each other. Or you're watching Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates create an incident that they could then use to increase the pressure on Iran.\\" On 17 June, the Pentagon released new images which, according to it, were taken from an MH-60R Navy surveillance helicopter of the aftermath of alleged Iranian attack on tankers in the Gulf of Oman. They again allegedly showed IRGC members removing an unexploded limpet mine.  Reactions  = Political =  Iran  IRGC Navy, with its distinctive chevron pattern and center console. After news of the incident, the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted \\"Suspicious doesn't begin to describe what likely transpired this morning.\\" He described the attacks as a move by \\"the B-team\\" to sabotage diplomacy. Iran's United Nations mission issued a statement wherein it called on the United States and its regional allies to \\"put an end to mischievous plots and false flag operations in the region.\\" Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani said that the United States may have carried out false flag operations against the oil tankers. On 18 June, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said on live television that \\"Iran will not wage war against any nation. Those facing us are a group of politicians with little experience.\\" Iran's mission to the United Nations responded to the U.S. accusation by saying that the Iranian government \\"categorically rejects\\" the U.S. claim that it was responsible for the attacks and condemned it \\"in the strongest possible terms\\".  United States  The United States identified this particular type of limpet mine, called \\"Iranian Indigenous Extra-Large Limpet Mine,\\" as being used in the attack. U.S. officials have blamed the attacks on Iran, with United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stating that the U.S. \\"would defend its forces and interests in the region\\". Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir agreed with Pompeo, saying \\"Iran has a history of doing this.\\" During an interview with Fox News, Trump further asserted the blame on Iran, calling the country \\"a nation of terror\\". Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders called for the incident to be \\"fully investigated\\" while adding that a war with Iran \\"would be an unmitigated disaster for the United States, Iran, the region and the world.‚ÄùSanders Warns Trump That War With Iran Would Be a 'Disaster' Fellow senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren echoed Sanders saying she was ‚Äúvery concerned about a slide towards war with Iran‚Äù. On 17 June, Maariv reported that diplomatic sources at the United Nations Headquarters revealed to the newspaper an American plan to carry out a tactical assault against Iran ‚Äì namely, aerial bombardment of an Iranian facility related to its nuclear program. That evening, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the deployment of 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East as a defensive response to the incident.  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated that they share the U.S. government's assessment that Iran is to blame for two attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, with British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling Iran's alleged actions \\"deeply unwise\\". The office released another statement that \\"It is almost certain that a branch of the Iranian military ‚Äì the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ‚Äì attacked the two tankers on 13 June. No other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible.\\" Hunt said \\"our starting point is obviously to believe our U.S. allies\\" and the UK \\"will be making our own assessment soberly and carefully\\". He accused Iran of orchestrating the May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident, stating \\"The Emirati-led investigation of the 12 May attack on four oil tankers near the port of Fujairah concluded that it was conducted by a sophisticated state actor. We are confident that Iran bears responsibility for that attack.\\" The position on the June incident was challenged on Twitter by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who questioned the existence of \\"credible evidence\\" and cautioned against fueling a war with rhetoric, an objection Hunt called \\"pathetic and predictable\\", before rhetorically questioning Corbyn's patriotism. Other countries Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud blamed Iran for the attacks. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih urged a \\"swift and decisive response\\" to the incident. Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir expressed support for the U.S. position, saying that \\"Iran has a history of doing this\\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that \\"the world needs to back the US\\" in the incident. The German government urged \\"a spiral of escalation must be avoided\\". Responding to the video released by the US Central Command, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas remarked that \\"to make a final assessment, this is not enough for me\\". Later, Chancellor Angela Merkel stated there was \\"strong evidence\\" that Iran was behind the attacks, adding \\"we must do everything to solve the conflict with Iran in a peaceful way\\".Merkel Sees ‚ÄòStrong Evidence‚Äô Iran Attacked Gulf Oil Tankers The Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero said: \\"We do think that there is room for finding a way for peace and stability in the world\\". Meanwhile, Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, said: \\"I believe that the main task of foreign ministers is to avoid war... you really shouldn't make the mistake of believing that you can solve a problem in the Middle East with weapons\\". Pekka Haavisto, his Finnish counterpart stated there should be \\"a proper investigation [to put] all the facts on the table and then we can look what really has happened, who is behind this\\". General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chinese President Xi Jinping told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani during an SCO meeting that China would promote ties with Iran regardless of developments from the incident. State councillor and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi asked for all parties involved to \\"not open a Pandora's box\\". Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned \\"against hasty conclusions, against attempts to lay the blame at the door of those we don't like\\". On 14 June 2019 Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Marie Eriksen S√∏reide while expressing concern said \\"On the Norwegian side, we await the final results of the investigation\\" and \\"We encourage all actors to show restraint and avoid actions that contribute to further escalation\\" The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes the attacks increase the tension in the area. The Norwegian Maritime Directorate has gone out to warn five Norwegian ships that are in the Gulf of Oman. On 15 June 2019, Prime Minister of Japan Shinz≈ç Abe \\"resolutely denounced\\" the attacks on both ships, though he did not point to any one country. His statement came following a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump. After reviewing the video evidence, a source close to Abe said \\"These are not definite proof that it's Iran\\" behind the attacks, and \\"even if it's the United States that makes the assertion, we cannot simply say we believe it\\".  Other organizations  The United Nations Security Council met on 13 June in a closed door meeting with a briefing by US acting Ambassador regarding Washington's assessment that Iran was responsible for the suspected attack on two tankers in the strategic sea lane. Paulo d'Amico, the chairman of the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, expressed concerns for the safety of other vessels in the region and their crews. As a result of the incident, shipping through the Strait has slowed, due to concerns of further damage. The Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit called on the United Nations Security Council to take action against those responsible and maintain maritime security. After meeting with UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres at UN headquarters in New York on 14 June, Aboul Gheit also stated ‚ÄúWe believe that responsibilities need to be clearly defined... The facts will be revealed, I am sure, it‚Äôs only a matter of time.‚Äù Amid U.S. accusations of Iran's involvement in the attack, Abuol Gheit said \\"My call to my Iranian and I call them Iranian brothers: Be careful and reverse course because you‚Äôre pushing everybody towards a confrontation that no one would be safe if it happens.\\" = Economic = Following a month-long decrease, the price of oil initially increased by 4% after the incident, then settled to an increase of 2%. The increase in oil prices has been attributed to uncertainty regarding the supply of oil, due to reduced shipping in the Strait of Hormuz as a result of this incident. On 17 June, the price of oil returned to its previous decreasing trend, falling by 1.7%. The price of insurance for cargo ships has also risen in response to the event, which could increase oil prices. Bloomberg reported that the war risk insurance premium for the Persian Gulf which had already increased following the May incidents ‚Äì jumped from US$50,000 to US$185,000 for supertankers.

The game is played by Google's Chrome web browser on a PC, or with the Google Earth app on iOS and Android devices.

Some of the team's background in game development led to game-related pitches. Noting that Google Earth had been used to host guided tours and geo quizzes, they felt it would be an ideal tool to house a geography game, and Creative Engineer JK Kafalas pitched Carmen Sandiego due to an affection for the series growing up. The team began working on a demo in the Summer of 2017. They taught themselves Keyhole Markup Language, and pulled some graphics from YouTube Let's Plays of the Super Nintendo edition. The demo received an \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" responsive from Google Earth staff, who agreed to pursue it.

He was born in 1865 in Elche, Valencia, and studied architecture in Barcelona, graduating in 1892. Developing his style in shadow of prominent Catalan architects such as Lluis Domenech i Montaner, Coquillat established himself as a noted proponent of the Modernista style in Catalunya. Most of his work is centred in Barcelona and San Justo Desvern. Coquillat collaborated with other architects, such as Arnald Calvet i Peyronill on the market in Sarri√† market and the Villa Conchita, and with Juli Marial i Tey on the Sant Miquel Tower in La Garriga. Between 1903 and 1905 he carried out restoration work on the Basilica of Santa Mar√≠a in his hometown of Elche. In 1906, Coquillat collaborated with architect V√≠ctor Beltr√≠ on a commission from the Maestre P√©rez mining family to build Casa Maestre on Plaza de San Francisco in Cartagena. The facade of this strikingly ornate Moderniste house bears prominent Neo-Rococo features. One of Coquillat's most noted buildings was the Hotel del Hist√≥geno Llopis on the Paseo de Rosales, Madrid, a project for the pharmaceuticals entrepreneur Adolfo Llopis Castelado. The hotel was built 1912-1914 in the Catalan Modernist style, and was highly acclaimed by his contemporaries. The building was heavily ornamented and featured a prominent loggia and balustrades, and was topped with an ornate cupola. The hotel was demolished in the 1970s. In 1915, Coquillat was commissioned to remodel the facade of the Casa Bonet in the fashionable Eixample district of Barcelona. Neighbouring houses on this block had been remodelled in a variety of clashing styles of the Modernista movement, giving the row of houses the nickname the Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (Mansana de la Disc√≤rdia). Coquillat moved away from the outlandish forms of Modernisme and chose instead to style the facade along relatively conservative Italianate Neo-Baroque lines. In contrast to the neighbouring Casa Amatller (Cadafalch, 1900) and Casa Batll√≥ (Gaud√≠, 1904), Coquillat's Casa Bonet is generally overlooked.

It is located at the Institut Laue‚ÄìLangevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France. The experiment started operating and taking data in November 2016.  Detector  = Measuring Principle = Figure 2: Comparison of the different spectra at 10 m and 12 m distance to the reactor. The black line shows the case without oscillation into sterile neutrinos while the blue and red show the case including the oscillation into a light sterile neutrino The STEREO detector is placed at a distance of 10 m away from the research reactor at the ILL. The research reactor has a thermal power of 58 MW. STEREO is supposed to measure the neutrino flux and spectrum near the reactor. To be able to detect the neutrinos radiated from the reactor, the detector is filled up with 1800 litres of organic liquid scintillator which is doped with gadolinium. Inside the scintillator neutrinos are captured via the process of inverse beta decay :\\\\overline{ u}_e + p \\\\rightarrow n + e^+ In this process a positron is produced. When the positron moves through the scintillator a light signal is produced, which is detected by the 48 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) placed at the top of the detector cells. The capturing of the neutron which is also produced during the inverse beta decay produces a second coincidence signal. The expected distance between the oscillation maximum and minimum of light sterile neutrinos is about 2 m. To see the oscillation the detector is divided into 6 separate detector cells, which each measure the energy spectrum of the detected neutrinos. By comparing the measured spectra a possible oscillation could be discovered (see Figure 2). The STEREO experiment detects \\\\sim400 neutrinos per day. = Detector Shielding = Neutrinos only interact weakly. Therefore, neutrino detectors such as STEREO need to be very sensitive and need a good shielding from additional background signals to be able to detect neutrinos precisely. To achieve this high sensitivity the 6 inner detector cells are surrounded by a liquid scintillator (without gadolinium) which acts as a \\"Gamma-Catcher\\" detecting in- and outgoing gamma radiation. This significantly increases the detection efficiency as well as the energy resolution of the detector. A cherenkov detector filled with water is placed on top of the detector to detect cosmic muons which are produced in the atmosphere and would otherwise act as a large background source. To shield the detector from radioactive sources coming from surrounding experiments it is surrounded and shielded by many layers (65 t) of mostly lead and polyethylene but also iron, steel and B_4C.  Motivation  Figure 3: The reactor- antineutrino-anomaly (RAA) Although neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that is quite well understood today, there are still some experimental observations that question the completeness of our understanding. The most prominent of these observations is the so-called reactor-antineutrino-anomaly (RAA) (see Figure 3). A number of short baseline reactor-neutrino experiments have measured a significantly lower anti-electron-neutrino (\\\\overline{ u}_e) flux compared to the theoretical predictions (2{,}7\\\\sigma deviation). Further experimental anomalies are the unexpected appearance of \\\\overline{ u}_e in a short-baseline \\\\overline{ u}_\\\\mu-beam (LSND anomaly) as well as the disappearance of u_e at short distances during the calibration phase of the GALLEX and SAGE experiments known as the gallium neutrino anomaly. These anomalies could signify that our understanding of neutrino oscillations is not yet complete and that neutrinos oscillate into another 4th neutrino species. However measurements of the decay width of the Z-Boson at the Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider (LEP) exclude the existence of a light 4th \\"active\\" (i.e. interacting via the weak force) neutrino. Hence the oscillation into additional light \\"sterile\\" neutrinos is considered as a possible explanation of the observed anomalies. In addition sterile neutrinos appear in many prominent extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics like e.g. in the seesaw type 1 mechanism.  Results (December 2019)  Figure 4: Exclusion contour drawn by the latest STEREO data in the plane of the amplitude of the oscillation towards an hypothetical 4th neutrino (horizontal axis) and the frequency of this oscillation (vertical axis). The blue area shows the expected exclusion coverage at the available statistical precision which would be obtained if all STEREO observables correspond exactly to the expectations without a 4th neutrino. The red area is the actual exclusion contour based on the measured data resulting in statistical fluctuations around the blue limit. All points inside the red contour are excluded with at least 90% confidence level. This result rejects a large part of the domain of existence of the 4th neutrino predicted from the reactor neutrino anomaly (indicated by the black contours). Initial results were released in 2018 exploiting a dataset of 66 days of reactor turned on. Most of the parameter space that could account for the RAA was excluded at a 90% confidence level. Updated results in December 2019 are based on \\\\sim65500 detected neutrinos (combined phase 1 and 2, 179 days of reactor-on data). Using the current data the region of exclusion is further extended (see figure 4).

McHugh and roughly 10 soldiers disembarked. As soon as they exited the landing craft, it was destroyed by a German shell. McHugh had been assigned to carry a tripod for a machine gun, however the soldier carrying the machine gun was killed in action so McHugh began crawling up the beach without a weapon. He spent the day in the sand avoiding German gunfire. Referring to his own experience on D-day, McHugh said, \\"It's hell day, it really is a hell day. Scared stiff, petrified and running like hell‚Ä¶ It was a lot of bodies around, I didn't want to be one of them.‚Äù His experience has been cited as emblematic of the dire experiences and vanishing memories of D-Day vets.

The conflict started during the process of the granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (2018-2019) and continued after the reception of the tomos (official decree) of autocephaly of the OCU (January 2019). The conflict involves Filaret (primate of the UOC-KP which merged into the OCU) along with his supporters, and Metropolitan Epiphanius (primate of the OCU) along with his supporters - as well as the bishops of the Ecumenical Patriarchate - who advocate a different model of church management.This conflict resulted in the departure of Filaret, along with two bishops and a dozen priests, from the OCU on 20 June 2019 after a Local Council convened by Filaret. Filaret and those who left with him returned to an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate.  Filaret's demands  = Diaspora, Holy synod, primate role = There were numerous things with which Filaret did not agree in the OCU. Filaret wanted: # To reorganize the Holy synod of the OCU by having 12 permanent appointed members of the holy synod instead of 3. # To lead the OCU together with the primate, Epiphanius, and claims it was agreed so before the unification council. # That the OCU be able to take care of the Ukrainian Orthodox diaspora. # That the OCU be able to make its own myrrh. # That the Ecumenical Patriarchate should not have a say in the internal conflict of the OCU. = OCU's name = Filaret told members of the media department of the dissolved Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) to convey the message that the OCU was not a new church and that the tomos of autocephaly was given to the UOC-KP. Filaret also instructed them to \\"eradicate\\" the name \\"Orthodox Church of Ukraine\\" because The Orthodox Church in Ukraine' means that this is not the ruling Church, but only one of the Churches in Ukraine ... And we are the ruling Church in Ukraine.\\" This discussion between Filaret and the members was recorded and the pro-Moscow anonymous Union of Orthodox Journalists shared the recording on its website on 23 January 2019. On 23 January 2019, Filaret declared in an interview given to the Federal News Agency that the OCU should be called \\"Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\". He says the origin of the name of the OCU is due to the fact that \\"there is an Orthodox church in Constantinople, and then they go [the exarchates dependent on Phanar]: the Orthodox Church in America, Canada, Europe, Australia - and the Orthodox Church in Ukraine\\". Filaret declared the OCU \\"should be called as all churches are called, and not be led by the Greeks\\". We want to be an autocephalous church ‚Äî just like all other Orthodox churches, no more and no less. We do not want neither more nor less. And we are grateful to Constantinople for the fact that Patriarch Bartholomew gave us a tomos of autocephaly, he has undergone much for this. But, having received a tomos of autocephaly, we must be an autocephalous church.sign=Filaretsource=}}Professor also supported Filaret, saying that \\"under no condition should we use the Orthodox Church in Ukraine or of Ukraine in press. Only the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and only with the possessive case.\\"  Rising tensions  = Deal at the unification council = On 15 December 2018, the hierarchs of the UAOC decided to dissolve the UAOC, and the hierarchs of the UOC-KP decided to dissolve the UOC-KP. This was done because on the same day the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Kyiv Patriarchate, and some members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were going to merge to form the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) after a unification council. The unification council elected Epiphanius as its primate. On 22 December 2018, Filaret declared that if he had run for the role of primate of the OCU at the unification council, Ukraine would never have got a tomos. On 20 January 2019, Filaret declared, concerning Epiphany: \\"I supported him and fought for his candidacy, because among all the young bishops I see him as the most worthy to be the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.\\" Filaret explained on 15 May 2019 in an appeal the conditions of the council. According to Filaret, the agreement reached at the unification council was as follows: \\"the primate is responsible for the external representation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and the patriarch is responsible for the internal church life in Ukraine, but in cooperation with the primate. The primate shall do nothing in the church without the consent of the patriarch. The patriarch chairs the meetings of the Holy Synod and the UOC meetings for the sake of preserving unity, its growth, and affirmation.\\" Filaret considers this agreement has not been fulfilled. This deal was confirmed by . However it is denied by . Filaret also said he was asked by the Ecumenical Patriarch not to put forward his (Filaret) candidacy at the council, and that , who chaired the council, asked him not to wear the koukoulion; Filaret was also asked to nominate any bishop for the post of primate. Filaret agreed to the demands and said he chose \\"humiliation\\" in order for the church to get the tomos. = After the unification council = Filaret was given the title of the \\"honorary patriarch\\" of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine after the council. Volodymyr Burega, Professor and Vice- Rector of the Kyiv Theological Academy, explains this title in this way: \\"in December [2018], no one wanted to aggravate relationships with Patriarch Philaret, since holding the council and receiving the Tomos were at stake. That is why the council, which took place on December 15, did not clarify the new status of Patriarch Filaret. After the unification council of the OCU, they stated that Filaret was henceforth \\"honorary patriarch\\", but what this phrase meant was difficult to understand. Indeed, such status is not stipulated in the Charter of the OCU, adopted on December 15.\\" On 16 December 2018, during a divine liturgy in which he came wearing the headgear of a patriarch, during his homily, Filaret declared he was still patriarch: \\"The Patriarch remains for life and, together with the Primate, governs the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\". After the mass, he was acclaimed by the hierarchs of the church as \\"great vladyka and father Filaret, the holiest patriarch of Kyiv and all Ukraine-Rus and sacred archimandrite of the Holy Dormition Kyiv- Pechersk Lavra\\". = After receiving the tomos = According to Epiphanius, a conflict had already started on 6 January after the tomos was received. The first meeting of the Holy synod of the OCU was very tense. Moreover, Filaret demanded for the members of the synod not be appointed according to the statute and the tomos of autocephaly of the OCU, but for members of the former Holy synod of the UOC-KP be appointed instead. In the end, the members of the holy synod were appointed following the statute and tomos. On 15 March 2019, Filaret declared that at the next local synod the OCU should change its charter, saying: \\"The most important thing is to change the number of permanent members of the Synod. We need not three of them but many more, like 12.\\" On 3 April, of the OCU wrote a text in which he said there was an attempt by the young bishops of the OCU to overthrow Filaret.  Beginning of risks of schism  = Filaret's St Macarius celebration = On 8 May 2019, Filaret sent invitations to former UOC-KP bishops for a meeting to celebrate St Macarius on May 13‚Äì14, but did not send an invitation to Epiphanius. On 9 May, Filaret declared the UOC-KP still existed: \\"the Kyiv Patriarchate has not been liquidated. It is not liquidated. They want to present the situation as if it was liquidated. The Kyiv Patriarchate can be liquidated by the one who created it\\". On 10 May, Filaret sent an invitation to Epipnanius; Filaret said he did not send an invitation to Epiphanius because since Epiphanius' election (five months) Epiphanius has not celebrated divine liturgy alongside with Filaret. The Ecumenical Patriarchate told BBC Ukraine about the situation when asked to comment: \\"This is terrible!\\" Filaret also stated to 1+1: \\"There is a patriarch, since there is a patriarch, it means there is a patriarchate, there is the Kyiv Patriarchate, and therefore it is not necessary to return the patriarchate, it is and must be\\". Asked by TCH if he admits that such actions could lead to a split in the church, Filaret said: \\"I admit, but we will create a single church - the Kyiv Patriarchate, necessarily.\\" Epiphanius gave an interview \\"connected with the rumors that Patriarch Emeritus Filaret wants to convene a Local Council in the beginning of summer with a view to change the Charter of the OCU and reassume the patriarchal status\\". In this interview, Epiphanius said that changing the charter of the OCU could mean a loss of the tomos, he also wrote on his Facebook page: \\"the return to the previous structure of the Kyiv Patriarchate means returning to isolation, loss of tomos and all the achievements of church independence.\\" On 13 May, Filaret admitted a split is possible inside the OCU. The Assembly of bishops to revise the tomos needs either to be convoked by the primate (Epiphanius), the Holy Synod of the OCU, or 1/3 of the total of the bishops of the OCU. Filaret maybe aimed for the third option. BBC Ukraine said that Filaret could possibly count on the support of , who had been forced by Filaret to give up his candidacy at the unification council, and is very influential within the OCU. The assembly of 14‚Äì15 May was seen as the first stage to revise the charter, as a \\"parade of forces\\" to see how many bishops would support revising the charter. However, only 4 bishops came, and Mykhayil did not come. Mykhayil was in Vinnitsia to help Metropolitan Simeon. During Filaret's sermon on 14 May he said: \\"We will continue to fight for a single local Orthodox Church, independent of Moscow, or from Constantinople\\". Still on 14 May, a rally to support the unity of the OCU took place outside of Filaret's residence; the rally had been organized by the public organization Corps of Defenders of the Revolution of Dignity. On the same day, in an interview given to Interfax- Ukraine, Epiphanius said there was \\"no schism\\". = Filaret's appeal = On 14 May 2019, Filaret published an appeal. In his appeal he said the OCU faced \\"separation, diarchy, which can lead to sad consequences\\". He added: He also said in his appeal that the Kyiv Patriarchate \\"was and will be\\", Filaret also said that giving up the status of patriarchate was a demand of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in order for the Ecumenical Patriarchate to grant a tomos to a Metropolis which was part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Filaret said that therefore \\"giving up on the status of patriarchy was purely situational\\". Moreover, Filaret also said that at the next meeting of the Holy Synod of the OCU, said synod would arrange Filaret's retirement, and that \\"Moscow is satisfied with the state of affairs in the UOC (OCU). What they could not achieve through various efforts, they are now achieving through the actions of the OCU head.\\" On the same day he made a press conference, in which he said: On an interview published on 15 May, said there will be no split and that Filaret's holy synod reforms were not supported. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew told BBC Ukraine on 15 May that there was no patriarch of Kyiv because \\"there never was\\". During the same press conference, he said: \\"I do not believe that Tomos will be withdrawn because the withdrawal of Tomos will strike at the Ecumenical Patriarchate itself.\\" Concerning the holding of the Local Council of the OCU, which Filaret, accor wants to convene to change the Charter of the OCU and then proclaim the Patriarchate, Filaret said it depended on the Synod of the OCU: \\"When the Synod will be determined, then it will be.\\" At the same time, Filaret did not specify how many OCU bishops supported such an idea: \\"I am not interested in how many bishops support me in this.\\" 15 May, wrote on his Facebook page: \\"In his appeal, Metropolitan Filaret refers to the arrangements that he claims to have guaranteed his participation in the administration of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine after receiving the Tomos of autocephaly, suggesting that Metropolitan Epiphanius would renounce most of his powers in favor of the \\"honorary patriarch.\\" However, it was reported that no such decisions were known to exist during the unification council that took place on December 15, 2018. Neither Metropolitan Filaret, nor Metropolitan Epiphanius, nor President Petro Poroshenko did inform the Council about such agreements.\\" On 16 May, Advisor of the then-President Poroshenko gave an interview in which he said that if the conditions set out in the tomos were not violated, said tomos would not be taken away. On 16 May, Epiphanius gave an interview to BBC Ukraine. In it, he said that the OCU will never go back to the old model of governance Filaret wants, and that there was no other mecanism to convey a council besides the primate or the holy synod. In the same interview, Epiphanius announced that the next Holy Synod meeting of the OCU would be on 24 May. On 17 May, \\"[t]he press service of the Kyiv Metropolis of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (OCU) gave an official clarification regarding the status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate. The document states that on December 15, 2018, the UOC-KP terminated its independent activity and all its fullness became part of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, according to the decision of its own Local Council.\\" On 17 May, of the OCU came out in support for Filaret. On 22 May, Filaret assured a delegation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate that he was supporting Epiphanius. Makariy declared in an interview published on 23 May that neither the UAOC nor the UOC-KP had been dissolved: \\"Some government officials spoke incorrectly when they publicly declared that the Kyiv Patriarchate was liquidated.\\" He explained that Philaret submitted only copies of documents, not the originals necessary in order to liquidate the UOC-KP. Macarius added: \\"When I was asked to hand over the documents for liquidation, I replied that until I see the originals from the other side, I will not turn in mine.\\" = Holy synod of the OCU = On 24 May, the meeting of the holy synod of the OCU was held. During the meeting, hundreds of people, mostly elderly, were near from where the meeting was taking place to show their support to Filaret by waving banners and shouting slogans. According to Epiphanius, Filaret did not sign to follow the OCU charter of 15 December 2018, while all the other members of the holy synod did, and during the synod Filaret said the UOC-KP still existed. He also said that all members of the holy synod had tried to tell Filaret that \\"de jure and de facto there is no Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate\\". After the meeting of the holy synod, Filaret declared: \\"The decisions of the Synod, if they do not contradict the canons and the interests of the Ukrainian church, will be fulfilled, and if they do harm to the Ukrainian church, I will not fulfill them,\\" and \\"I will defend the Kyiv Patriarchate to the end!\\" On 24 May, Filaret said they \\"didn't know what was written\\" on the tomos until the unification council was done; Filaret added: \\"We accept the tomos and thank for it. But we accept the part where we are recognized as an autocephalous church.\\" On 25 May, Filaret went to the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery where he congratulated Epiphanius for his name day and said: \\"Our main task is to unite all Orthodoxy of Ukraine into a single Local Orthodox Church. If we achieve this, it will mean that Ukraine is invincible because it has a solid foundation\\". On the same day, Filaret gave interview in which he said that the 24 May holy synod was \\"aimed at the destruction of the Kyiv Patriarchate\\" and that \\"[n]ow there is an influence on our primate of these pro-Moscow forces that have entered. And their task is to destroy the Kyiv Patriarchate.\\" On 25 May, of the Ecumenical Patriarchate answered allegations from Filaret by saying that \\"All the accusations that [the OCU's] Primate is surrounded by some pro-Russian forces is a myth. Metropolitan Epifaniy is a young and powerful person that we support together with all Ukrainians.\\" = Suspension of the rector of the Kyiv Theological Academy = On 28 May, Filaret uissued a document with the forms and the seal of the Kyiv Patriarchate to suspend , priest and rector of the . Oleksandr was at that time considered as Epiphanius' right arm. Kyiv was at the time Filaret's diocese - except the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery - according to the decision of the 5 February 2019 holy synod of the OCU. On 29 May, Epiphanius issued a document stipulation that after 30 January 2019, all documents \\"on behalf of the religious association of the UOC-KP, which ceased its activities\\" are invalid, and that until the next holy synod the parish of Oleksandr Trifimlyuk would be directly subordinated to Epiphanius. On the same day, Filaret immediately responded by sending a letter to Epiphanius, saying the latter violated canon law by welcoming clergy from the Kyiv diocese (diocese which belongs to the jurisdiction of Filaret) into his (Epiphanius) jurisdiction. On 31 May, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew made an address to the , in which Bartholomew said: \\"As for Filaret, he was restored to his episcopal dignity as former Metropolitan of Kyiv. The so-called 'Patriarchate of Kyiv' does not exist and never existed\\". On 1 June 2019, Bishop of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine said on his Facebook page that, according to calls he received from priest-rectors of the churches of Kyiv, Filaret asked all his priests of Kyiv to come at his residence on Monday 3 June 2019 at 11 o' clock. The callers said Filaret would force them to sign an oath to the Kyiv Patriarchate and to Filaret as Patriarch. Bishop Adrian said he advised the priests to decide themselves whether they want to follow Filaret or not. On 3 June 2019, an assembly of priests took place at Filaret's residence in Kyiv. Allegedly, they were asked not to talk about what happened during the meeting and did not sign any document; almost all priests of Kyiv came to the meeting. One priest who came to the meeting said they discussed convening a local council. On 4 June, the OCU released on its Youtube channel a video of Filaret dissolving the KP. On 5 June, some of Filaret's declarations at the 3 June meeting were revealed by TSN. Filaret said:On 5 June, the press service of the Kyiv Patriarchate, \\"[i]n connection with the mass media dissemination of a great deal of distorted news\\", released a statement explaining why the Kyiv Patriarchate still exists, acknowledging the documents of the KP's dissolution. In an interview extract of Epiphanius by Ukrinform published on 5 June, Epiphanius said concerning convening a local council: \\"A few months ago, we held a Unification Local Orthodox Council at which we almost unanimously adopted the Charter of this Church. There is no urgent need to convene [another Local Council] now.\\"  Kyiv Patriarchate Forum, announcement of the KP Local Council  On 7 June, the UOC-KP accounced a forum of intellectuals would take place on 11 June; the title of the forum was \\"For the Ukrainian Orthodox Church! For the Kyiv Patriarchate!\\" According to the RISU, this forum is an act which \\"obvious[ly]\\" falls within the scenario of reinstating the Kyiv Patriarchate. On 11 June, before the beginning of the forum, Filaret clarified that he will convene a council of the Kyiv Patriarchate on 20 June 2019: \\"We are convening the Local Council which will not uphold the decision of the Council held on December 15, 2018. It means it is not mandatory for us. This will show that the Kyiv Patriarchate has existed, still exists and will continue to exist. We have scheduled the Council for June 20.\\" Filaret said during the forum: \\"We do not accept this Tomos because we did not know the contents of the Tomos we were granted. Had we known its content, we would not have voted for autocephaly on December 15. For we don't have to rush from one dependence to another. The Moscow Patriarchate serves the interests of Moscow, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine serves the Greeks. And who will serve Ukraine?\\" Filaret also said Epiphanius was \\"a servant of the Ecumenical Patriarch. He put the Greek as a vicar bishop so that he could observe and hand over information to the Ecumenical Patriarch to give instructions through him of what to do.\\" In an interview given the same day to Glavcom, Filaret said the main reason why Epiphanius was trying to liquidate the UOC-KP was in order for him (Epiphanius) to take the UOC-KP's money. Filaret explained that he had been told by Poroshenko that he (Filaret) would be leading the OCU \\"just as you did it before, while Epiphany would represent the Church on the outside\\". Filaret also stated that the OCU was not independent for three reasons: first and foremost because the OCU cannot make its own myrrh (\\"the Church that does not have such a right is not independent\\" he says), second because it cannot have dioceses outside of Ukraine, and thirdly because it agrees that the Ecumenical Patriarchate can solve problems which arise within the OCU. In another interview given the same day to the TV channel Present Time, Filaret reaffirmed that he disagreed with those three points (myrrh, diaspora and appeal to the Ecumenical Patriarchate). According to the UOC-KP, two students of the who had gone to the 11 June Kyiv Patriarchate Forum have been expelled from said academy on 11 June \\"for participating in activities aimed at causing a split of a single local Orthodox Church of Ukraine\\". = Filaret concerning the tomos and the OCU = On 12 June, in an interview with Ukrainian Radio, Filaret said: Filaret also said concerning the future of the UOC-KP: \\"At first it will be small, but this Kyiv Patriarchate is certain to grow again to become a large one. Because the Ukrainian people demand an independent church.\\" He also declared that the OCU was \\"a purely formal association.\\" Filaret also said the UOC-KP Local Council of 20 June would be legal and that the Kyiv Patriarchate continued to exist. = Warning from the OCU, invitations to the Local Council = On 14 June, Epiphanius officially warned Filaret that the latter had not rights to convene a Local council of the UOC- KP. Epiphanius wrote: \\"The voluntary and non-statutory conduct of an assembly of a group of unauthorized persons -- such assembly being referred to as the Council -- will constitute the church split and the secession of organizers and participants of such meetings from the Orthodox Church of Ukraine with all canonical and legal consequences\\". Epiphanius also wrote the Kyiv Patriarchate had ceased to exist on 15 December 2018. On the same day, Epiphanius said in an interview that the Kyiv Patriarchate had been dissolved and that now Filaret \\"can only talk about the creation of a new structure with the old name\\". On 14 June, Filaret sent invitations for the Local Council of the UOC- KP. On 18 June, Epiphanius said the OCU would render its judgement concerning Filaret's council at the end of June and the Filaret's council would be \\"a meeting with no canonical status.\\" On the same day, the OCU asked military chaplains not to take part in Filaret's council. On 19 June, of the OCU announced that on 20 June a forum on the importance of the unity of the Ukrainian Orthodox church would take place.  Filaret's Local Council  = Local Council = On 20 June 2019, the Local Council took place, at the St. Volodymyr's Cathedral. Only two bisops came: and his vicar, bishop who head parishes of the UOC-KP in Russia and Moldova. A dozen priests also came at the council. In the same day the Patriarch Emeritus of Kyiv, Filaret (Denysenko) consecrated as bishops two priests that have been expelled from the Ukrainian autocephalous church: the Archimandrite Andriy (Marutsak) and the Hieromonk Ilya (Zelensky). The holy service took place in the Kyiv‚Äôs Saint Sophia's Cathedral and had as its co-consecrators the Metropolitan of Belgorod, Joasaph (Shibaev), and the Bishop of Valujsk, Petr (Moskalev). The latter was expelled from the autocephalous Church. Since the Ukrainian autocephalous Church \\"is approved by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church\\", the consecration of two priests expelled by the autocephalous Church has been seen as a patriarchal schism. The Local Council approved a resolution saying the council abrogated the decisions of the unification council. The resolution also stated that \\"[t]he UOC-KP continues to be the owner of all funds, all property (movable and immovable) purchased [with] its own money or transferred to it by state authorities or local government bodies\\". The resolution also said that the tomos of autocephaly of the OCU placed the OCU in dependence of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The resolution also stated that the council thanked Patriarch Bartholomew \\"for his attempts to resolve the Ukrainian church problem,\\" but emphasized that they disagreed with the text of the Tomos. The Local Council also elected two new bishops. The document also reaffirmed that Filaret was the head of the UOC-KP, elected \\"for life [...] on October 20‚Äì22, 1995\\". Filaret declared on the same day: \\"Ukraine will have the Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine that has a tomos - [...] a limited tomos subordinating it to the Ecumenical Patriarchate - and there will be a third independent church - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate.\\" He added that if the OCU wanted to unite with the UOC-KP, nobody would be against it. On 21 June, Filaret asked Ukrainian Interior Minister Askan Avakov to protect the faithful and the property of the Kyiv Patriarchate from the \\"illegal actions of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine\\"; Filaret gave the examples of the St. Feodosiya's monastery and the Uspensky shrine which he claims have been captured by the OCU. = Reaction of the OCU = On 20 June 2019, the OCU declared in an official communiqu√© concerning Filaret's council: \\"The assembly that gathered today at Flilaret‚Äôs personal will has neither legal nor canonical effects for the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. This is not a split, a small part of the OCU branched out into a new structure and named it the UOC-Kyiv Patriarchate, but it is not the UOC-KP and cannot be it. This assembly cannot question the validity of the Tomos or the authority of the OCU. The only consequence of this action is that Filaret will no longer have any powers in the OCU.\\" On 24 June, the Holy synod of the OCU met. Before the council began, when asked by the BBC if a radical decision concerning Filaret's excommunication would be made, Epiphanius said: \\"No. We will not be like the Moscow church and pass such decisions.\\" The Holy synod decided that, taking into account the 20 June Local council convened by Filaret as well as \\"the special past merits before the Ukrainian Orthodox Church\\", Filaret would remain a bishop of the OCU. However, the Holy synod decided that the diocese of Kyiv would be thenceforth headed by Epiphanius and not by Filaret. The Holy Synod decided to expel and , who had attended the 20 June Local Council, from the OCU. The Synod also declared that the UOC-KP and the UAOC had completely united into the OCU. On 25 June, Filaret declared: \\"We remain a church independent of Moscow or from Constantinople. We have our own charter and continue to exist in Ukraine as the independent Ukrainian Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate, and separated from the OCU.\\" In July 2019, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew said the path Filaret had taken was wrong. On 5 December 2019, the Holy Synod of the OCU decided concerning how Filaret will be treated after the UOC-KP will have been liquidated. The Holy synod decided that Filaret had \\"the right for a life-long stay and use for his activity a complex of buildings at the city of Kyiv, Pushkinskaya Street, 36.\\", \\"[...] a life-long right to worship [i.e. hold liturgies] at the Volodymyr Cathedral of Kyiv\\", and that \\"[t]he life-long material maintenance of the Honorary Patriarch Filaret and the financing of a religious organization in the form of a mission shall be made by deductions from the Volodymyr Cathedral of the city of Kyiv and voluntary donations.\\" The synod also emphasized that the opinion that the OCU \\"wants to throw Patriarch Filaret out\\" was not true and unjustifiably provoked misunderstandings among believers and the public. On the same day, in an interview to BBC Ukraine, Epiphanius said: \\"Bishop Filaret remains the Bishop of the OCU until now. If you have noticed, during the Holy Synod, his place awaits until now. He is self-isolated, has a small number of supporters who surround him, but we believe he will change his mind and will continue to be with us.\\" Epiphanius added: \\"[Filaret] overestimated his capabilities because he had high support from the people according to sociological polls. Bishop Filaret, even during the meetings of the Holy Synod, told us that \\"if you do not listen to me and obey my instructions, I will go out, call on the people, and the people and the clergy will definitely support me\\"\\". On 28 December, the OCU officially stated that Filaret was a \\"retired bishop\\" with \\"no canonical or statutory rights to convene and hold church meetings, to elect and ordain bishops.\\" The OCU added that \\"on the basis of Canon 4 of the Second Ecumenical Council [...] all acts committed by the Honorary Patriarch Filaret contrary to the canons and the Statute of the Church are void. [...] [E]very person declared 'bishop' in an illicit way by the Honorary Patriarch Filaret and 'appointed', in particular, to a see where there is already a licit bishop, is not a bishop\\".  Suspension of Filaret from the OCU's Holy Synod  On 4 February 2020, the synod of the OCU decided that Filaret remained part of the episcopate of the OCU, but that he had lost the canonical responsibility and rights associated with the governance of his diocese. The synod also decided to strip Filaret of his place at the Holy Synod of the OCU. The Holy Synod of the OCU also stated that the bishops consecrated by Filaret had no valid holy order. The press service of the UOC-KP said the decision to remove Filaret from the Holy Synod of the OCU was non-canonical since he was already the primate of the UOC-KP. The press release added that a similar decision to declare Filaret's ordination null and void had also been taken by the Moscow Patriarchate and that after the Moscow Patriarchate's \\"ban\\", the overwhelming majority of the OCU, including its primate, had been consecrated by Filaret and other archpastors.  Filaret's followers  In December 2019, according to the Department of Religions and Nationalities of Ukraine, 10 to 15 parishes wanted to be under the jurisdiction of Patriarch Filaret. On 3 February 2020, the bishop and the diocese of East Moldova of the OCU left the OCU and asked to join the UOC-KP.

It has a drainage basin of . The river is formed from the confluence of the Dranse d'Entremont and the Dranse de Bagnes at the village of Sembrancher. Further upriver the Dranse d'Entremont splits into the Dranse d'Entremont and the Dranse de Ferret. History In 57/56 BC Julius Caesar sent Servius Galba with the Twelfth Legion and some cavalry to open the Great St Bernard Pass. The legion fought the Veragri at the village of Octodurus along the Drance river and drove them across the river before establishing a camp near the river. The Seduni and Veragri attacked the legion camp a few days later in the Battle of Octodurus. In 1349 a wooden toll bridge and dam are mentioned near La B√¢tiaz village (now part of Martigny). In 1595 the river flooded and destroyed a chapel in La B√¢tiaz and damage in Bagnes. In 1818 a glacial dam gave way below Gi√©tro Glacier releasing of water into the river, killing 44 people and destroying many structures along the river. The last covered bridge in use in Valais today was built in 1829 to replace a bridge over the Drance which was destroyed in the 1818 flood. On 26 July 2006 the Drance flooded destroying a section of railway track and derailing a St. Bernard Express train. All 34 passengers and the conductor of the train were uninjured. The floods also forced several thousand to evacuate in Martigny and other villages along the river. Geography The Drance river is an alpine river mostly fed by glacial runoff. High in the Alps it is fed by numerous small streams that run down the surrounding mountains. The river flows into the Rhone river near the village of Martigny. About upriver at Sembrancher, the river splits into the Dranse d'Entremont and the Dranse de Bagnes. Continuing upstream past Sembrancher the Dranse d'Entremont rises to the south. At Orsi√®res it splits into the Dranse d'Entremont and the Dranse de Ferret. The Dranse d'Entremont passes through Lac des Toules before reaching its source near the Great St Bernard Pass. The Dranse de Ferret continues south until it reaches the Lacs de Fen√™tre on the western slope of the Pointe de Dr√¥ne. The Dranse de Bagnes rises to the east and then south east, passing through Lac de Mauvoisin, before reaching its source at the Brenay Glacier.

Stott worked in the cotton industry in Bury, and he became active in his trade union, the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers, becoming its assistant general secretary by 1930. The Beamers were affiliated to the United Textile Factory Workers' Association (UTFWA), and this organisation sponsored him as a Labour Party in Heywood and Radcliffe at the 1931 UK general election. The Manchester Guardian described him as a \\"powerful free trade candidate\\", but he was not elected. William C. Robinson, secretary of the Beamers, died in 1931, and Stott was elected as his successor. In 1934, he persuaded the UTFWA to adopt a new policy of support for the socialisation of the Lancashire cotton industry, and in 1935, he used this backing to gain the support of the Trades Union Congress. His increased profile led him to win election as vice president of the UTFWA, and also to the management committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions. By 1939, Stott was eager to obtain a higher level role in trade unionism. The post of general secretary of the International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations became available, and he won the role. World War II broke out, and so the role remained low profile until it was over. He then led the reconstruction of the federation, bringing together the various surviving or re-established unions of textile workers. Stott retired in 1949, and suffered poor health for several years before his death, in 1957.

The system was mainly made up of Gorizont II class satellites. The number of satellites planned and launched is a subject of debate. According to the CIA, 11 satellites were planned, but other sources have quoted 10 and 7 satellites. The system was never top secret, and the Soviet Union voluntarily released information about the system. According to declassified CIA documents, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, Statsionar 1 in 1975, 5 years behind schedule, and planned to deploy the last satellite in the Statsionar system in 1980. The CIA studied the system, and concluded that Statsionar was not being created as a counter to the INTELSAT system, and would not have any effect on American satellite communications. The CIA also concluded that Statsionar was behind the capabilities of INTELSAT by at least 5 years, and that the system would have trouble meeting even its own, comparatively low operation standards. Statsionar was used to send commands from Soviet leadership to field units. However, the main purpose of Statsionar was to broadcast television channels and for other non-military purposes. The Soviet Union first made plans for the Statsionar program in 1969. Intersputnik, the Soviet equivalent to INTELSAT used Statsionar for some of its communications purposes, but after enough satellites in the Intersputnik system had been launched, Stationar was no longer used.

Baldwin had ventured to Atlanta as a literary reporter on assignment by Playboy magazine, which by then had published a considerable catalog by black writers, such as Alex Haley and James Farmer, offering social commentary. Walter Lowe, the magazine's first black editor, had proposed this assignment to Baldwin. The resulting book's epigraph draws from Hebrews 11:1.  Background  Baldwin's collection of work had made him a prominent social critic. While researching the Atlanta Child Murders, he encounters Camille Bell, the mother of a 15-year-old, named Jo-Jo Bell, killed in this period. Camille Bell created a Committee to Stop Children's Murders, which advocated for the affected families. According to Derrick Bell, who wrote the foreword in the book's 1995 edition, the earlier outcry had revealed the need for Baldwin to write an essay that ‚Äúeschews a search for clues and, instead, undertakes an exploration for truths.‚Äù[3]  Summary  = Race Relations = The investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders was overseen by then police commissioner Lee Brown. Fear was heightened around the city and people grew anxious and more concerned as time passed. Lee held several city meetings during this time period hoping to calm public fear and reinstate public trust in the police to find the murderer. Lee brought together a task force of more than 100 personnel from Atlanta's own police force and nearby, governing law-enforcement agencies. During the tenure of Brown as Atlanta's police commissioner, efforts rose to diversify Atlanta's police force, which at the time was only 20% African- American officers. The same Atlanta police force in the late 1940s hired its first African-American police officers; however, it stripped them of enforcing all laws; for instance, black officers were not allowed to arrest white people. Baldwin remarks not only on the relationship between the African- American community and the police, but specifically, the relationship between said community and African-American police-officers. Some of Atlanta's black officers were Baldwin's guides while reporting in the city, which allowed for Baldwin to observe the officers reactions to the community's view of the black police force. Baldwin compares the relationship between the police and the community in Atlanta to that of his hometown, Harlem. In Harlem, the black officers understood the community distrusted them but Baldwin remarks that it did not matter, and compares this to Atlanta's black officers, who received the same sentiment from their own community, but Baldwin writes, \\"the knowledge seemed to sting.\\" = A City Too Busy to Care = On June 21, 1981, Wayne Williams was arrested on the murders of Nathaniel Cater and Jimmy Payne. Commencing on January 6, 1982, the trial was overseen by judge Clarence Cooper. Baldwin gives readers backstory on Cooper, and explains that the then district attorney, Lewis Slaton, both guided prosecutions and aided development of Atlanta's black legal workers. Baldwin ponders Wayne Williams's upbringing, stresses that Williams was never legally accused of 28 murders, and eventually concludes that Williams \\"must be added to the list of Atlanta's slaughtered black children.\\"(3) Baldwin discusses that judge Cooper was born in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb, whereby Cooper could potentially say, \\"I'm from Atlanta. I'm not from Georgia.\\" Baldwin mentions the original analogy about Harlem: \\"I'm from Harlem. I'm not from New York.\\" Baldwin asserts the clarity of the claim while stating that both cities are not nations. Baldwin references his own personal interactions with friends in Atlanta who assume the same identity of belonging to a city outside of the nation it belongs to. Baldwin discusses how Atlanta had originated as a railroad town named Terminus. In the 1980s, Atlanta hosted one of the \\"world's busiest\\" airports. Baldwin remarks on the success of Atlanta as a commercial hub to highlight what the city placed importance on being \\"The City Too Busy To Hate.\\" Baldwin's critical analysis on the Atlanta Child Murders sparked substantial interest and intrigue surrounding the case. Many citizens began to demand reform for missing child cases in Atlanta after further supporting evidence from the murders were shared with the general public. In 1991, Journal Constitution released the composite list of names and ages of the victims. Within the two month investigative period, Wayne Williams was convicted and tried for the Atlanta Child Murders after being connected to two of the victims. Subsequently, he was immediately indited and sentenced to life, despite his two victims being adults. However, over the years there has been significant backlash over the sole involvement of Williams. Many citizens have speculated other theories concerning the Atlanta Child Murders based on circumstantial evidence, including involvement of the KKK, convicted pedophiles, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CIA. In 2019, after a news report on the Atlanta Child Murders, a considerable amount of new evidence surfaced from testimonies that created a new wave of interest from Atlanta's mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms. = The Committee to Stop Children's Murders = Camille Bell was a young mother to a 9 year old boy named Yusuf Bell. Yusuf‚Äôs body was found in a crawlspace in an abandoned elementary school that had been empty for over five years. When Bell contacted police about the investigation of her son‚Äôs death, she was ignored. Bell and a number of mothers formed a \\"support group\\" that soon became the Committee to Stop Children‚Äôs Murders. This committee sought to determine the culprit behind the Atlanta Child Murders. By the time the committee was formed in May 1980, eight children had been murdered and their killer remained at large. Baldwin praised Bell for her extensive knowledge of the murders, but mentioned that, out of respect, he did not interview Bell. The Committee to Stop Children's Murders began collecting funds to help the parents of the murdered children continue their venture. But Georgia charged them of having \\"violated Georgia law as concerned charitable solicitations.\\"  Critical reception  In the 1985 New York Times review, John Flemming gives a brief synopsis of the Child Murders. He acknowledges Baldwin's account of the grotesque nature of not only the murders themselves, but the state of race relations in America. Flemming writes about Baldwin's sentiment where during his investigations and research he felt like a stranger in the city of Atlanta. His repeated mention of Baldwin's assessment of Wayne Williams's trial reflects a major part of his essay, where Baldwin acknowledges Williams's behavior as abnormal, but he still believed the trial to be a focus of skepticism. In Richard Schur's review of Baldwin's work, he ties the essay's publication date in the 1980s as part of a collective effort by intellectuals and activists to criticize the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's legal strategy in garnering freedom and equality for African-Americans. Schur canvases Baldwin's disposition concerning the failure of legal activists to realize that eradicating legal, racist doctrines were insufficient in rehabilitating the lives of African Americans. Moreover, Schur states that Baldwin believed evaluating the evidence during the Civil Rights Movement would have been more practical than eradicating racist laws, which would have been able to dissolve conditioning taking place between courts, judges and juries.

Biography  = First years = First-born of Francesco Ranieri, a State official, and of Maria Luisa Conzo, Antonio Ranieri was born in Naples (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) on 8 September 1806. A liberal since adolescence, and suspected of belonging to the Carbonari, Antonio Ranieri was forced to leave Naples in 1827 and settle in Florence (Grand Duchy of Tuscany), a city open to political refugees, the following year. In Florence he met important intellectuals and writers such as Pietro Giordani, Alessandro Poerio, Giovan Pietro Vieusseux, Pietro Colletta, Giuseppe Ricciardi and, above all, he met Giacomo Leopardi for the first time. In Bologna (Papal States), he was briefly a pupil of the famed hyperpolyglot Cardinal Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti, then moved to Paris, where he met Antoine Destutt de Tracy and Lafayette. = Friendship with Giacomo Leopardi = In 1830 he traveled throughout Europe, finally returning to Italy to begin a seven-years cohabitation with Leopardi, until the latter's death. This cohabitation, which was also the subject of rumors,Letter 859, 05/01/1833: \\"[...] My poor Ranieri! If the people mock you because of me, it comforts me at least that they certainly mock me too because of you [...].\\" Leopardi 2010, p. 1427. was the central moment in Ranieri's life and made him famous as the \\"guardian\\" of the last years of the genius of Recanati. Leopardi's deep affection for Ranieri transpires from certain letters he wrote to him during a brief moment of separation (Ranieri being in Naples, Leopardi in Florence), for example:Leopardi 2010, p. 1429. Marble bust of Leopardi, by Michele Tripisciano (1898). After staying in Rome and Florence to follow Ranieri's mistress, actress Maddalena Pelzet, he and Leopardi met the noblewoman Fanny Targioni Tozzetti (1801 ‚Äì 1889), whom both loved: Ranieri with success, Leopardi not. In 1833, Ranieri moved to Naples with Leopardi. Ranieri did not find a good welcome in his hometown, due to the controversial cohabitation with Leopardi and the unconventionality of the latter's thought. Nevertheless, he dedicated himself to historiography (Storia del Regno di Napoli, 1835) and literature (Ginevra o l‚Äôorfana della Nunziata, 1839), being favored by the association with Leopardi and close to his thought. His writings, marked by anti-clericalism, attacks on institutions and Italian patriotism, caused him troubles with censorship. = Leopardi's death and burial controversies = To defend himself from the cholera epidemic (see 1826‚Äì1837 cholera pandemic), in 1836 Ranieri moved with Leopardi to Torre del Greco (Naples), in a friend's country house. Ranieri in old age. On 14 June 1837, when they returned to Naples, Leopardi died of heart dropsy, as Ranieri reportedRanieri 1995, p. 109. ‚Äì even if there is a strong suspicion that the poet died of cholera, and that Ranieri lied in order to hide a less decorous death. Together with his sister Paolina, Ranieri assisted the poet to the end and, as he himself reported in his memoirs and his letters to Monaldo Leopardi,Ranieri 1995, pp. 92, 103‚Äì119. prevented the remains from being thrown into a mass grave (as well as the strict hygiene rules required due to the epidemic), having him buried first, and clandestinely, in the crypt, then in the atrium of the Church of S. Vitale in Fuorigrotta, a quarter of Naples.Ranieri 1995, pp. 92, 103, 137. Nevertheless, Ranieri's story had immediately appeared full of contradictions and many doubts arose about what he had declared, also because his versions were many and different depending on the interlocutor, making one suspect that the poet's body was ended up in the mass graves of the Fontanelle Cemetery, or in the Cemetery of the 366 Fossae in Naples (such was the fate, in those days, of famous people like Niccol√≤ Zingarelli), or even hidden in the Neapolitan house where the death had occurred, and that Ranieri had staged an empty coffin funeral, with the participation of his own brothers and a corrupt priest. Ranieri continued to state that the bones were in the atrium of the Church of S. Vitale and that the burial certificate was a forgery written by the priest in order to circumvent the law on burials in times of epidemic. However, it is proved that Ranieri lied in other cases: for example, he long maintained that he did not know where the 4,000 pages of Leopardi's Zibaldone di pensieri were: they were finally found in his house. On 21 July 1900 the official reconnaissance of Leopardi's remains was carried out and in the coffin ‚Äì too small to contain the skeleton of a man with double hump ‚Äì only fragments of bones (including ribs, vertebrae bearing signs of deformity) were found, and a whole left femur, perhaps too long for a person of short stature as Leopardi was, and another broken femur), a heeled shoe and some rags, while there was no trace of the skull and the rest of the skeleton. = Later years = Forty years after Leopardi's death, Ranieri published the work that consecrated his fame to this day, Sette anni di sodalizio con Giacomo Leopardi (1880), a memoir followed by bitter controversies over the author's self-congratulation, the overabundance of details unfavorable to the poet's memory and the absence of reflections on his intellectual greatness.Ranieri 1995, p. 8. However, though inaccurate and inappropriate in some descriptions, he offered a testimony of the biographical events of the two friends. In 1861, Ranieri was elected as a Deputy to the Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy, being repeatedly confirmed until 1881. On 16 November 1882, he became a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy. He died in Portici (Naples) on 4 January 1888.

It belonged to the family Odobenidae, the only extant species of which is the walrus. Members of the genus Prototaria are believed to be the most basal imagotariine pinnipeds. Unlike their closest living relative, the walrus, members of Prototaria were primarily piscivorous carnivores.  Description  Prototaria were more similar in appearance to modern fur seals and sea lions than walruses. They did not have long tusks as walruses do, and were more slender. Fossils ascribed to Prototaria exhibit some autapomorphies, including: a large antorbital process and orbit, and a relatively narrow intertemporal region of the skull. P. planicephala has a wider rostrum than P. primigena as well as more specialized cheek teeth and a flatter tympanic bulla.  Taxonomy  The type species of Prototaria is P. primigena.

During a campus placement, one of the interviewers, Mr. Parthasarathy rejects Raju, highlighting the latter's neurotic personality. Raju is dejected and his father vows to transform him into a trendy guy. To that end, his parents prepare him a list of activities he has to do before graduating. Consequently Raju befriends delinquent students and Shruthi once more loves him, however he is conflicted about cheating all of them just to get a job. To complete the final activity, that is getting Shruthi to propose Raju, his parents plan a fake birthday party for him. However, some delinquents, jealous of Raju, engineer an unfavorable situation which leads to conflicts. Afterwards, they expose the schemes of Raju's parents, and Raju falls out of favour. Disillusioned by the series of events, Raju realises that friendship and love are not syllabus, but sentiments that should not be toyed with. He sheds his image and decides to travel alone for a while, exploring the world around him. One day, while relaxing near a river, Raju witnesses a young boy commit suicide. Raju rushes the boy to the hospital but the latter dies en route. The boy's suicide note states that he was interested in cricket but everyone around him pushed him to study against his will. Raju confronts the school principal and has an altercation with him, which garners media attention. In the end, Raju states that education is not a business and the lessons of life are extremely important. Raju returns and reconciles with his friends. He turns down Parthasarathy's job offer, but thanks him for inspiring him. Many years later, Raju and Shruthi are married. He watches a man pointing at a company campus and telling his son to achieve the first rank, so that he may earn a place there. Raju approaches the boy and tells him that while hard work may earn him a job, following his heart will earn him an entire business. The father tells Raju to not say such things, but Raju points out that he owns the company in front of him.

It is marked by a long conspicuous fault scarp but the fault extends beyond the ends of this scarp. The Meers fault is part of a group of faults that lie between the Anadarko Basin and the Wichita Mountains. While the fault was active during the Permian-Cambrian, movement possibly accompanied by earthquakes took place during the Holocene and formed the fault scarp, with one earthquake occurring less than 2,000 years ago. There is currently no seismicity on the fault but it is considered an earthquake hazard.  Appearance  Map of faults in Oklahoma, with the Wichita Fault highlighted The Meers Fault runs along the northern side of Meers Valley through Comanche County and Kiowa County and close to Caddo County in an east-southeast to north-northwest direction. Towns close to the fault are Cooperton, Meers, Apache, Fort Sill, Treasure Island and Elgin; Oklahoma State Highway 19, Oklahoma State Highway 115, Oklahoma State Highway 58 and U.S. Route 281 cross the fault and Oklahoma State Highway 44 might do so as well. The fault scarp is located on private land; the southeastern part runs through farmland and the northwestern part runs through hilly terrain. The Meers fault is a reverse fault (at first it was interpreted to be a normal fault) with a straight path despite a variable topography; it probably does take the form of a broad dislocation rather than of a plane and its expression varies depending on the substrate rock. Underground, the fault may be over long. It dips first northeastward but deeper it becomes either vertical or down-to-the-southwest, but certainly steep at depth. One interpretation is that the Meers fault is a \\"back-thrust\\" that dips northwards. Unlike many other faults, there is no evidence of segmentation in the Meers fault. A conspicuous high and ‚Äì long fault scarp just north of the Wichita Mountains is noticeable on Google Earth; it has formed on the Holocene part of the fault and continues southeastwards in the form of more subtle scarps although it may not exactly coincide with the path of the fault. Because the scarp is not present along the entire length of the fault, it is subdivided in a southeastern section in Comanche County and a northwestern section in Kiowa County, with only the southeastern section featuring a scarp. The scarp marks the Holocene section of the fault. The Meers fault is the only Mid-Continent fault scarp and has been called the \\"finest\\" such scarp east of the Rocky Mountains. In low sun-angle photography additional scarps and splays can be observed. The erosion/sedimentation patterns and the path of drainages such as Canyon Creek may have been influenced by movement along the fault, and topographic ridges are offset. Finally ductile folding, vegetation and landform variations have also been recognized on the Meers fault. In some rock formations faulting has mainly led to warping, instead of brittle displacements and in several sites evidence of faulting appears to be concealed by floodplain sedimentation. The fault separates Cambrian-Proterozoic igneous rocks from thick Cambrian-Ordovician age carbonates to the northeast. The igneous rocks belong to the Amarillo- Wichita uplift and are much more magnetic than the carbonates; this has been used to trace the fault with aeromagnetic techniques although the igneous rocks also reduce its visibility in reflection seismology studies. The nature of the surrounding rocks also influences the expression of the Meers fault, as it has a more pronounced scarp in erosion-resistant rock units. = Geological context = Geological cross section across the Wichita Mountains The Meers fault is among the most prominent tectonic structures in the region. Other faults in the area are the Blue Creek Canyon fault which is connected to the Meers fault at its northwestern end, the Broxton Fault Complex northeast and the Mountain View fault to the north which intersects with and is also connected to the Meers fault. Additional faults in the region are the Cement, the Cordell and the Duncan-Criner faults. All these faults lie in the area of the Frontal Wichita fault system, which is located between the Anadarko Basin to the north and the Amarillo-Wichita uplift to the south and separates the two. The fault system, which also includes the Meers fault as its southern margin, was active during the Mississippian to Permian, generating a total offset of about . The development of the Meers fault may have been influenced by the South Oklahoma aulacogen. Both the Wichita Mountains thrust and possibly a second fault are linked with the Meers fault, which is the only fault in the Wichita fault system with Holocene activity.  Geologic history  The Meers fault has been in existence for most of the Phanerozoic. It may have begun as a rift margin fault in the Proterozoic-Cambrian associated with the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen but its maximum activity took place during the Mississippian and Permian when the Wichita Mountains and the Slick Hills were offset along it by about and the Meers Valley formed along the fault. More fault movements occurred in the Permian and the Pleistocene although there are no post-Permian rock formations in the area that could allow an estimation of post-Paleozoic movements. However, Pleistocene sediments and Holocene alluvium have been offset, indicating fault movement during this time. Recent research has suggested that the whole fault may be of Quaternary age with little activity during the Pennsylvanian. During the history of the fault considerable uplift took place on its southern side while the recent movement has generated an opposite movement. = Holocene activity = Two to four earthquakes occurred during the Holocene in the last 6,000 years, one of which occurred 1,100‚Äì1,300 years ago and the other 2,000‚Äì2,900 years ago. The dates have been obtained through radiocarbon dating on soil in trenches dug in the fault scarp and of offset alluvium deposits. Additional faulting appears to have occurred over 12,000 years ago, but evidence thereof was partly eroded away during a time of a wetter climate and prior to the Holocene the fault might have been inactive for 100,000‚Äì130,000 years. The slip rate has been estimated to be , which is typical for intraplate faults. The Meers fault is the only fault on Oklahoma which has generated a rupture on the surface, resulting in about of vertical offset over a long distance. It is possible that the fault rupture was limited by geological structures that occur at the northwestern end of the Meers fault where it splays out. The possibility that faulting continued for another along its northwestern end is equivocal with some evidence indicating that recent faulting was limited to Comanche County; research published in 2019 indicates that the northwestern segment did not move during the 1,200 BP earthquake but was active in the 3,400‚Äì2,900 BP event. The underground rupture on the other hand might reach a length of . Reconstructions of the intensity of the Holocene earthquakes indicates magnitudes of with possibly similar intensities, with the terrain north of the fault being shifted upwards and leftwards relative to the terrain to its south; this latter movement and the position of the Meers fault are consistent with the tectonic stress pattern of North America which favours movement along the Meers fault. The ratio of the horizontal to vertical motion is about 1.3‚Äì1.5 or about 2:1 although the amount of horizontal movement on the fault is controversial. Alternatively, the fault movement could have occurred through aseismic creep as there is little evidence of strong ground shaking in the area as well as evidence against strong ground motion although the soils found close to the fault trace show evidence of fast movement. In general, the movement direction of the Meers fault is contentious. = Present-day status = The Meers fault presently is largely aseismic, with no earthquakes recorded along its Holocene trace or any evidence of aseismic creep although minor seismicity has been recorded and a earthquake close to Lawton in 1998 is close to the southeastern end of the Meers fault. Likewise, seismicity is scarce in the wider region and photographic analysis has shown little evidence of recent fault movement in other faults of the Wichita fault system.  Seismological context and threats  The region is part of the stable continent and away from plate boundaries and other tectonically active areas. Earthquakes in Oklahoma have been observed in the areas of the southern Oklahoma aulacogen and of the Amarillo-Wichita uplift; in southwestern Oklahoma they are rare and of moderate intensity. In the wider area around the Meers fault such as in the Texas Panhandle, the Arbuckle Mountains and around Enola, Arkansas there is evidence of recent seismic and fault activity which may be part of a larger seismic zone. The activity of the Meers fault and other seismicity has been related to a continent-spanning fault zone and there might be a relation to the Brevard Zone in Atlanta as well. Judging earthquake hazards in the central and eastern United States is made hard by the scarcity of geological evidence of seismicity, the long timespans between earthquakes and the shortness of the historical record thereof. In addition, earthquakes are often only weakly correlated to geological structures such as faults. Assessing the hazard potential for the Meers fault suffers from similar problems but it is considered the largest seismic hazard source of the central United States as it has the potential to cause large earthquakes and earthquakes in the central United States usually affect much larger regions than those of the western United States. In particular, it indicates that the Mid-Continent is not free of earthquakes and that the absence of recent seismicity does not rule out the presence of active faults. Other regional faults such as the Washita Valley fault which runs parallel to the Meers fault may also be capable of causing earthquakes. Earthquake hazard map published in 2014 The USGS national hazard map states that the Meers fault has a recurrence interval of 4,500 years but estimates range from 100,000 years to 1,300 years. The fault may generate strong earthquakes in the future; earthquakes with magnitudes might be possible on the Meers fault and an earthquake similar to the Holocene ones would be felt over large parts of the continent, including Oklahoma and Texas, with intensities comparable to these of the 1886 Charleston earthquake and 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes.  Naming and research history  The fault was discovered during field work in the 1930s‚Äì1940s and is named after the town of Meers; previously it was known as the \\"Thomas fault\\" after a ranch named George Thomas Ranch and then as the \\"Meers Valley fault\\". The scarp was described as a Permian fault scarp before Holocene activity was discovered and made known by Gilbert 1983 and Donovan et al. 1983. The discovery of Holocene activity at the Meers fault was a surprise to scientists and attracted the attention of geologists after two publications in 1983 highlighted the young movements on this fault; it is the best researched fault east of Colorado.

It was written by Kaz and Mr. Lawrence, and was directed by Sherm Cohen, Dave Cunningham, and Adam Paloian. Additionally, Brian Morante and Fred Osmond served as storyboard directors, while Michelle Bryan, Alan Smart, and Tom Yasumi served as animation directors, and Jonas Morgenstein directed the live-action segments. The special, produced as part of the show's twelfth season, originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on July 12, 2019, celebrating the series' twentieth anniversary. The television series follows the adventures of SpongeBob SquarePants (voiced by Tom Kenny) in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In the special, the citizens of Bikini Bottom plan a surprise birthday party for SpongeBob, while he and Patrick Star (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) tour the surface world and come across their real-life selves. The live-action portions of the special also feature several guest stars including Kel Mitchell, Jack Griffo, Daniella Perkins, and David Hasselhoff, the latter of whom starred as himself in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. The special is dedicated to the memory of SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died from complications of ALS in 2018. Upon release, it received generally positive reviews. Plot In Encino, California, Patchy the Pirate is attempting to start his boat to get to Bikini Bottom to give SpongeBob his birthday present. Potty the Parrot points out that the boat is out of fuel, so Patchy decides to walk to his destination instead. Down in Bikini Bottom, Gary the Snail awakens SpongeBob and gifts him a special jellyfish net. Meanwhile, at Patrick's rock, Sandy Cheeks has gathered Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Mrs. Puff, Sheldon Plankton, Bubble Bass, and an old man to go over the plans for SpongeBob's surprise birthday party. Patrick is tasked with taking SpongeBob on a sightseeing tour while the rest decorate SpongeBob's house for his party. Patrick walks to SpongeBob's house while Plankton hides in his pocket so he can grab SpongeBob's keys. The aquarium-style bus for the tour arrives on schedule and both SpongeBob and Patrick get onboard. The bus's tour guide, Rube, announces that they will be visiting the surface land. They arrive on land with a little help from the French Narrator's submarine. When they arrive on the beach, the tour guide gives incorrect information about the creatures who inhabit the area. They soon come to a bean-sponsored party hosted by a wild mascot (Kel Mitchell). At SpongeBob's house, the others, now joined by Squidward Tentacles, are arguing over the party's theme. Sandy, the peacekeeper, decides they each should divide the house into each of their separate themes, with Mr. Krabs coming up with a Krusty Krab-themed party, Mrs. Puff with a boating school theme, Plankton with a torture theme, Bubble Bass with a Mermaid Man theme, Squidward with a theme based around himself, and Sandy with a karate theme. The party goes into full swing, but chaos soon approaches and begins to tear SpongeBob's house apart. Back on the surface, the tour makes stops at a park (narrowly avoiding an on-course collision with Patchy and Potty) and an office building. The office workers leave for a lunch break, leading the tourists to the Trusty Slab restaurant. Inside the restaurant, the tourists encounter their human counterparts, including an indecisive customer (played by Patrick's voice actor Bill Fagerbakke), the grumpy cashier Manward (played by Squidward's voice actor Rodger Bumpass), the penny-pinching boss Mr. Slabs (played by Mr. Krabs' voice actor Clancy Brown), an impatient astronaut (played by Sandy's voice actress Carolyn Lawrence), and the energetic fry cook JimBob (played by SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny). JimBob mistakes SpongeBob for some cheese for his Slabby Patty and puts him into a burger. Patrick rescues him, leaving the Slabby Patty without a patty. Shortly after, the restaurant is robbed by a business competitor named Charleston (played by Plankton's voice actor Mr. Lawrence). He is foiled by Mr. Slabs and sent flying toward the dumpster. The tourists leave and encounter a pet store that sells fish. A cheerful lady (played by Pearl's voice actress Lori Alan) mistakes the bus for an aquarium and takes it inside, where she puts it on the shelf. Things appear to be bleak, but Patrick comes up with the idea to push the bus over the side. They escape the store, taking some of the store's fish with them. As they get back to the beach, the bus accidentally runs over Hasselhoff's foot. Hasselhoff blames Patchy, who uses the bean-sponsored contest's bean cannon to reach Bikini Atoll. Once they reach the ocean, they free the fish from the aquarium and they return to Bikini Bottom. Upon exiting the bus, SpongeBob asks Rube for the birthday song that he asked throughout the special. Before they can sing, Rube leans forward and accidentally hits the pedal, and the bus drives away. Patrick opens SpongeBob's door to see that the house is a mess, but he is oblivious to this. SpongeBob finally arrives at his surprise party to find everyone fast asleep. Just then, a giant box falls from out of the sky. SpongeBob opens it and finds Patchy's disembodied head. Patchy leads the cast in a birthday-themed version of the show's theme song with a montage of celebrities wishing SpongeBob a happy birthday including David Hasselhoff, Kel Mitchell, JoJo Siwa, Tiffany Haddish, Thomas F. Wilson, Sigourney Weaver, Heidi Klum, Kal Penn, Lana Condor (replaced by John Goodman in alternate airings), Jason Sudeikis, RuPaul, Vernon Davis, Rob Gronkowski, the cast of the SpongeBob SquarePants musical, and Gilbert Gottfried. As the song finishes, Patrick asks SpongeBob how old he is, only for SpongeBob to be interrupted by TV static with SpongeBob blowing his nose like a flute (as he did in the series' opening sequence). Broadcast and reception =Viewership= SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout premiered on July 12, 2019 simultaneously across Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, and TeenNick. The three-network premiere was collectively viewed by 2.2 million people in the United States, and it posted year-to-year gains for the network across multiple demographics, most notably, Kids 2-11 (3.3/797K, +57%). The special's premiere date is notable for taking place five days before the 20th anniversary of the series's official premiere, which took place on July 17, 1999. It aired in other territories on July 12 and July 13, 2019, Tom Kenny's 57th birthday.

Also into Kannada language as Gattimela in Zee Kannada  Plot  Abhimanyu and Samyukta meet in an automobile accident and instantly hate each other, but conspire to help Abhimanyu's brother Harshan who has fallen in love with Samyukta's sister Sapthathi, although Sapthathi is engaged to a man called Ramesh Babu because of her parents' insistence. Sapthathi and Harshan fall in love after seeing each other at Sapthathi's cousin brother's wedding (Aromal) and Harshan's sister's wedding (Madhuri). Avanthika, who is Sapthathi's cousin and Aromal's sister gets jealous of this because she dislikes a poor girl like Sapthathi marrying a rich man like Harshan. Following a series of misunderstandings, Sapthathi's marriage to Ramesh Babu is called off and the new match proposed. Sapthathi's parents agree but Harshan's mom Sharmila insists that Abhimanyu marry first as the eldest son. Though he is a woman hater with no interest in marriage, Abhi says he will marry his employee, Nithya. Samyukta learns that Sharmila has ill intentions and Sharmila threatens to have Sapthathi killed if Samyukta doesn't stop the marriage. Samyukta is suspicious when Nithya disappears, but it turns out that Abhi was never serious about the marriage and paid Nithya to pretend. Abhimanyu's relatives suggest that he marry Samyukta and he asks her to refuse his proposal before their families. However, she accepts it so that her sister can get married and they are soon married, as are Harshan and Sapthathi. Both couples move into the family home, though Abhimanyu and Samyukta continue to quarrel. Sharmila consults an astrologer and convinces Sapthathi that there is a threat to Harshan's life, and tell Sapthathi that she must not consummate their marriage for 6 months, which was Subatra and Avanthika's plan to distance the couple. Sapthathi makes excuses to postpone the consummation of their marriage to save Harshan, and the couple faces ongoing interference from his relatives. Samyukta later learns that the astrologer is a cheat but when she tells Sapthathi she doesn't believe her stating that Sharmila, Jyothirmayi and Avanthika would never do such a thing. Avanthika moves into the home in a scheme of Sharmila's, and she tries to come between Harshan and Sapthathi. Samyukta warns Sapthathi that Avanthika is a fake but Avanthika acts like she has changed so Sapthathi does not heed Samyukta's advice but trusts Avanthika, who helps to frame Samyukta for the theft of family heirlooms, and then plans a trick on Samyukta who calls the police and Avanthika forces Sapthathi to tell the police that Samyukta has a mental illness. Abhi becomes slightly sympathetic and seems to grow closer to Samyukta. However, he gives her divorce papers on his birthday. Samyukta challenges him to give her a year to make him fall in love with her, which he accepts. Abhi's pregnant sister Madhuri moves into the household and becomes an ally to Samyukta. In a complicated plot they put pressure on Sharmila,by putting things in Sapthathi's drink to make her sick, which helps them fake a pregnancy for Sapthathi. When the pregnancy is confirmed by two doctors Samyukta and Madhuri is called, Sapthathi gets worried because she has not consummated her marriage yet. Sharmila shouts at her thinking that she did consummate. Avanthika, Jyothirmayi and Sharmila are thinking of a plan when Samyukta calls Sapthathi and makes her listen to them talking about their schemes. Sapthathi confronts them for their underhanded behaviour. Samyukta's old college friend Sruthi begins working for Abhi's business. They conspire to make Abhi jealous by faking calls to Samyukta from a man named Indrajith. Shruthi eventually impersonates Indrajith and visits the home, but Abhi gives Shruthi/Indrajith his blessing to marry Samyukta. Indrajith/Shruthi instead challenges Abhi to three tasks to test whether he loves Samyukta. Abhi, however, fails in all 3 tests and confesses his love for Samyukta. He then witnesses an attack on Samyukta by a man employed by Sharmila .Abhimanyu files an FIR and the police get the truth out of Samyukta's attacker. However, the police blackmail Sharmila for money and she agrees to hand over the money. Her secret is kept safe. Sharmila hatch many plans to separate Abhimanyu and Samyukta. But Samyukta wins every time and gets very much closer to Abhi. When Samvrutha, Samyukta's sister learns about Samyukta's divorce through her friend Sarath who is also Samyukta and Abhi's divorce lawyer and love interest of Samvrutha they both plan to make Abhimanyu and Samyukta close. As a part of their plan, they arrange for an outing for the couple but it is postponed by Sharmila. In A turn of events, it is also revealed that Harshan and Sarath were college buddies and had once promised that their respective wives should be sisters. Meanwhile, Samyukta's family move into Abhimanyu's house as their house has been conquered by their owner's son which is a plan of Sharmila to make them stay here and humiliate them which will result in Samyukta leaving the house. Meanwhile, Sapthathi and Harshan consummate their marriage thanks to helping of Samyukta and Sapthathi becomes pregnant. Later Sarath and his friend doubt whether Samvrutha loves Sarath and make a drama which makes Samvrutha and Sarath confess their love. As Abhimanyu's and Samyukta's marriage happened in a rush, Abhi and Samyukta's family plans another wedding for them. Sharmila kidnaps Samvrutha and Sarath on eve of the wedding to frame them of eloping. But Abhi finds out about their kidnap and rushed to rescue them but he is also kidnapped by the goons. Samyukta finds this on the day of marriage and rescues Abhi, Samvrutha, Sarath with the help of ranbir and police. Meanwhile, Samyukta's father comes to know about evil plans of Sharmila and her mother and threatens them that he will reveal the truth. Sharmila kills him which is witnessed by Sarayu but her aide prevents Sarayu from shouting for help. Everybody starts asking for Samyukta, Abhimanyu, Samvrutha and there comes a letter stating that Samvrutha has eloped with Sarath (letter written by Sharmila) and Sharmila makes Yatheendran's death as a suicide owing to the elopement of his third daughter which makes everyone believe including Samyukta. Sarayu later manages to flee from the clutches of Sharmila's hired goon but is knocked down to temporary paralysis.

Ethics dumping can occur intentionally when researchers knowingly side-step restrictive regulatory regimes to undertake research abroad that would be prohibited in their home setting. It can also occur unintentionally, especially in the context of international research, if researchers lack the knowledge or ethics awareness to undertake studies appropriately in unfamiliar settings.  History  The term 'ethics dumping' originated with a call for funding in the European Union Horizon 2020 framework program. In December 2013, funding stream GARRI.6.2014 invited proposals to reduce the risk of ethics dumping, defined as ‚Äúthe exportation of research practices that would not be accepted in Europe on ethical grounds‚Äù.Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-2015 (2015) 16. Science with and for Society. Revised. European Commission Decision C (2015)2453 of 17 April 2015. The European Commission describes ethics dumping within Horizon 2020 as follows: \\"Due to the progressive globalisation of research activities, the risk is higher that research with sensitive ethical issues is conducted by European organisations outside the EU in a way that would not be accepted in Europe from an ethical point of view. This exportation of these non-compliant research practices is called ethics dumping\\". In 2015, a proposal from the TRUST consortium was selected by peer reviewers from a range of proposals submitted to GARRI.6.2014 to tackle the problem of ethics dumping. The primary output from the TRUST project work to reduce the risk of ethics dumping was a new code of ethics: the Global Code of Conduct for Research in Resource-Poor Settings (see below).  Examples  The following are some examples of different types of ethics dumping. * Choosing a location or population for research, which is unlikely to benefit in full, or at all, from the research, for instance: Avian influenza research involving Indonesian human blood samples, when Indonesians were unlikely to benefit from the resulting vaccines. * Imposing burdens and risks on research participants who are unlikely to benefit themselves, for instance: Ebola virus research undertaken in a resource-poor setting that had no incidence of Ebola, and amongst vulnerable populations who were unlikely to obtain access to the resulting products and services. * Exporting valuable materials abroad without benefit sharing, for instance: Export of biological samples from South Africa ‚Äúto developed countries occurs frequently‚Äù and whilst research ‚Äúparticipants were supportive of providing samples for research, serious concerns were voiced about future use, benefit sharing and export of samples‚Äù. * Undertaking medical research where the control group is only offered placebo even though an effective alternative is available, for instance: Three clinical trials on cervical cancer in India contributed to the deaths of 254 women in the control group as ‚Äúknown and effective methods of screening for cervical cancer were ‚Ä¶ withheld from 141,000 women in areas where it was known to be of high incidence and prevalence‚Äù. * Undertaking research without ethics approval, for instance: Failure to obtain ethical approval for research in Nepal or effort to obtain retrospective ethical approval in Liberia when the publication of research results was otherwise blocked. * Refusing to accept research participants‚Äô rights, for instance: Refusal by an overseas company conducting a Chinese clinical trial to pay financial compensation for harm incurred as a result of taking part in medical research. * Culturally inappropriate conduct of researchers, for instance: ‚ÄúResearchers took photographs of individuals in their homes, of breastfeeding mothers, or of underage children, whilst ignoring our social customs and norms. Bribes or other advantages were offered‚Äù.San Code of Research Ethics (2017) developed by the South African San Council, the South African San Institute and the TRUST consortium, see: Callaway, E. (2017) South Africa‚Äôs San people issue ethics code to scientists, Nature News, 20 March 2017. 14 San Code of Research Ethics.  The Global Code of Conduct for Research in Resource-Poor Settings  The main initiative to counter ethics dumping is the Global Code of Conduct for Research in Resource-Poor Settings. This was developed by the multinational TRUST project team of ethicists, researchers, policy makers, research funders, industry personnel, medics, and representatives from communities who had extensive experience of being exploited in research. For example, Andries Steenkamp, a revered San Leader (1960-2016) and member of the TRUST consortium, expressed the need for a code of ethics. \\"We get given consent forms and documents, often in a hurry. We sign because we need the money and then end up with regret. It feels like a form of abuse. They want something from us and they know how to get it. Because of our socio-economic conditions, we will always be vulnerable to those from the North. A code of ethics is needed\\". The resultant code consists of 23 short articles (stipulations), that are designed to address risks for ethics dumping, and framed around a new moral framework (fairness, respect, care and honesty). The ethics code applies across all research disciplines from biology to zoology and aims to establish equitable partnerships in research. In 2018 it was adopted by the European Commission as a mandatory reference document for applicants to Europe‚Äôs biggest research fund: Horizon 2020 and the forthcoming Horizon Europe, to ensure its impact on the practice of ethics dumping. This code of conduct is mandatory for researchers applying for these funding streams and who plan to undertake research activities in low and middle-income countries.

The series is produced by American company DreamWorks Animation Television and animated by South Korean studio Mir. The series follows a girl called Kipo Oak, who is searching for her father after being forced to flee from her burrow, and must explore the post-apocalyptic surface world ruled by mutated animals to find him. Along the way she befriends human survivors Wolf and Benson, and the mutant animals Dave and Mandu. The series has been critically acclaimed for its design, characterization, music, worldbuilding, voice acting, and diversity. The series is particularly notable for its representation of LGBT and characters of color. The show's three seasons, each ten episodes long, were released in 2020. Season 1 was released on January 14, season 2 on June 12, 2020, and season 3 on October 12. Synopsis Kipo Oak, a thirteen-year-old girl, is searching for her father after being forced to flee from her underground city. To do so, she travels through an overgrown post-apocalyptic urban wasteland called \\"Las Vistas\\", ruled by sapient mutant animals (\\"mutes\\"), together with her new friends Wolf, Mandu, Benson and Dave. Sechrist compared the series to The Wizard of Oz, \\"but instead of ruby slippers [Kipo] has Converse on\\". In the first season, Kipo is separated from her father Lio after their burrow is attacked by a \\"mega monkey\\", a colossal, mutated spider monkey. Traversing through Las Vistas, she meets and befriends Wolf, a cold and hardened girl who has been surviving on her own after her adoptive wolf family turned on her, the upbeat Benson and his insect companion Dave, and the pig Mandu. Together, they set out to find the burrow Lio and the rest of Kipo's community fled to after their first one was destroyed. As the five journey along they make many mute allies and enemies, including the tyrant Scarlemagne, who intends to create a human army with his mind-controlling pheromones. Kipo also starts to experience strange physical mutations that give her mute-like abilities. In the second season, Kipo seeks to rescue her people after they are captured by Scarlemagne, and also discover the origin of her mute powers. Kipo learns she was experimented with mute DNA by her parents before her birth, turning her into a half-human, half-jaguar hybrid. She also learns about Scarlemagne's tragic past and his ties to her family, and that her mother Song, previously thought to be deceased, is actually the mega monkey who destroyed her burrow, mutated as a side effect from her pregnancy with Kipo and mind-controlled by the manipulative Dr. Emilia. Kipo starts to lose control of her abilities, putting her at risk of transforming into a mega jaguar permanently, but she is able to regain control with the help of her friends and family. She defeats Scarlemagne and frees Song from her mind control, but meanwhile Dr. Emilia has turned most of Kipo's people over to her cause of reverting mutes back into normal animals so human civilization can rise again. In the third season, Kipo creates the \\"Human Mute Ultimate Friendship Alliance\\" to thwart Dr. Emilia, but struggles to make humans and mutes work together. Emilia manages to create an anti-mute cure with Kipo's DNA, and it is with this cure that Kipo turns her mother human again. Ultimately, Kipo succeeds in making peace between mutes and humans. With her plans foiled and unwilling to accept change, Emilia turns herself into a mega mute to kill Kipo and her friends, but she is defeated with Scarlemagne's help, who sacrifices himself to save Kipo. Five years later, Kipo happily lives on the surface where humans and mutes finally co-exist in harmony. Development The series was first announced at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2019. It is based on Sechrist's 2015 webcomic Kipo. Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts was created by Radford Sechrist, previously a storyboard artist for Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and later director on the Ben 10: Omniverse. The series has five writers in addition to showrunner Sechrist and executive producer Bill Wolkoff. They worked in two teams, each comprising a director and three board artists. The animation is made by Studio Mir in South Korea using traditional animation methods. About sixty people worked on the series at DreamWorks, and about fifty-five at Studio Mir.

Episodes =Season 1= =Season 2= =Season 3= Reception The first two seasons of Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts have a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes. At io9, Beth Elderkin described Kipo as a \\"must-watch\\", writing that it joined the likes of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Gravity Falls and Steven Universe as a series with a broad appeal to many age groups, and highlighting its music and art design. At Collider, Dave Trumbore noted Kipos similarity to other recent female-led animated portal fantasy series such as Amphibia and The Owl House, and described it as a \\"classic in the making\\" that drew on cultural touchstones such as Fallout, The Warriors, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Planet of the Apes and Alice in Wonderland. Writing for Polygon, Petrana Radulovic appreciated that beneath a standard fantasy exploration quest, the series is a \\"vibrant mosaic, with a unique world, multidimensional character relationships, and a deeper underlying plot\\" about the tensions between mutes and humans. She also noted that Benson was the first character to have an explicit coming out as gay in an all-ages animation series, and that the understated manner of the scene, in episode 6, made it all the more noteworthy. Charles Pulliam-Moore at io9 likewise wrote that the series's \\"casual queerness is fantastic\\" because Benson's orientation is not treated as a plot point to complicate Kipo's feelings for him, but, \\"with a distinct matter-of-factness\\", as just one aspect of his character.

It is home to the Europe-Latin America Programme, offering students the opportunity to study the countries of the Iberian Peninsula and South America. Founded in 2001, it inaugurated its new home in a medieval former convent, renamed Coll√®ge Ali√©nor, in January 2019. History The campus was created in 2001, as one of the first decentralised campuses, along with Nancy and Dijon, of the Paris Institute of Political Studies. The campus moved to the renovated seventeenth-century H√¥tel Chaboureau, property of the University of Poitiers, in 2004. Initially, the H√¥tel Chaboureau welcomed around 120 students. However, following considerable growth, Sciences Po acquired a new site located on rue Jean-Jaur√®s, which was inaugurated in January 2019. This will allow the campus to increase its capacity to around 250 students. The site, a medieval Jacobite convent, dating back to the thirteenth century, was renamed Coll√®ge Ali√©nor as a tribute to Eleanor of Aquitaine. It has a long history as a centre of learning, having been chosen as the seat of the University of Poitiers by Pope Eugene IV in the fifteenth century, and more recently having served as one of the campuses of the √âcole sup√©rieure de commerce et management, who vacated the site in 2018. Studies The Poitiers Campus prepares students for the prestigious Bachelor of Arts (BA) in the Social Sciences and Humanities, a multidisciplinary programme common to all students of the Sciences Po Undergraduate College, regardless of their campus. The curriculum provides students with academic and methodological foundations in economics, history, humanities, law, political science, and sociology. Students continue with advanced study of the disciplines through a multidisciplinary perspective while diving into coursework related to their multidisciplinary major of choice: Economy & Society, Political Humanities, or Politics & Government. The particularity of the Poitiers Campus is the specialisation on South America, Spain and Portugal. The programme offers the opportunity to focus on the political, geopolitical and economic issues of Latin America, in a comparative perspective with the European Union, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. Students explore Latin America's history and contemporary questions such as democratic issues, how economies are integrating into the globalised economy, urban development, and regional and continental integration. The programme is taught mainly in French, with some courses in English, Spanish and optionally in Portuguese. Sciences Po has integrated a civic learning programme as part of the undergraduate studies. This helps students make the direct link between civic issues covered in class and their personal engagement to giving back to society through participation in activities hosted by the university or initiatives in the public, private, or non-profit sectors. During their third year, students are required to complete their studies abroad in a partner university. The Poitiers Campus also offers a dual degree programme with University College London, as well as partnership programmes with the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo, Torcuato di Tella University, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. The Campus also organises an annual winter school for its students, either in Spain or in Portugal. Student life Accommodating around 200 students, almost 60% of whom are international students of over 30 nationalities (mainly from Latin America and Spain), the campus benefits from a large cultural diversity. The Campus is situated in the historic university town of Poitiers, home to one of the oldest universities in Europe (founded in 1431), and with a student population that makes up a quarter of the total number of inhabitants. Many sporting and cultural events enrich student life both within the university and in the town itself.

It is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in South-East Asia.  History  = Eastern Orthodoxy in the region = Since the mid-1990s, a large number of immigrants from the former Soviet Union came to Thailand. At that time, there was no Orthodox parishes in the entire territory of the Kingdom. As recalled about the beginning of his service in the Kingdom, Archimandrite Oleg (Cherepanin) said: \\"this was the end of the 1990s; then in Thailand came Russians to engage business. In Russia back then it was very hard, and in Thailand it was possible to live well. But we had no churches in the vast expanses of the South-East ‚Äî from Russia to Australia [...] There was only one Orthodox Church in Hong Kong, and it was not under the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. The opening of the parish in Thailand is an initiative of Russians who lived in this country.\\" In response to numerous appeals of Russian Orthodox believers, mostly citizens of the former USSR countries, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on December 28, 1999 decided to open the Nicholas parish in Bangkok. By the same decision, the first rector of the newly formed parish was appointed: hegumen Oleg (Cherepanin). On December 27, 2001, having considered the activities of St. Nicholas parish in Bangkok, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decided to open a Representative Office of the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) in the Kingdom of Thailand. Hegumen Oleg (Cherepanin) was chosen to be the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Thailand, he was also blessed to carry out spiritual care of Orthodox believers in the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The mission carried out control and administrative supervision and spiritual care of Orthodox parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Thailand, the Cambodia and the Laos, and determined the General concept of the development of Orthodoxy in these countries on the basis of instructions and directions of the authorities of the Russian Orthodox Church. = Russian Orthodox Church in Thailand = After the registration of the Russian Orthodox Church in Thailand in 2008, it became possible to open parishes throughout the country, which became 10 by 2018, and for all of them permanent churches were built. In addition, a Theological College was built and opened on the island of Phuket to train clergy from the native people of South-East Asia who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. Three parishes in Cambodia were established, with permanent churches were built for two of them. Attempts were made to begin missionary work in Laos. On 21 October 2016, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church established the Patriarchal deanery within the Kingdom of Thailand, appointing Archimandrite Oleg (Cherepanin) as Dean of these parishes. At the same time, parishes in Cambodia and Laos, fell under the jurisdiction of Bishop Sergius (Chashin) of Solnechnogorsk. = Creation of the PESEA = 28 December 2018 Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church established the Patriarchal Exarchate in South- East Asia (PESEA) with Sergius (Chashin) as its primate. On February 26, 2019, the Holy Synod abolished the Deanery of the Moscow Patriarchate parishes in Thailand and established the Diocese of Thailand comprising the Kingdom of Thailand, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.

John Kourkouas (or ŒöœÅŒøŒ∫œåŒ±œÇ, Krokoas in Symeon the Logothete, George the Monk, and others) is the first known member of the Kourkouas family.. The family name is Armenian, being a Hellenization of the name \\"Gurgen\\", and they hailed from Dokeia (modern Tokat) in the Armeniac Theme. John Kourkouas was the commander (domestikos) of the elite regiment of the Hikanatoi, and led a conspiracy against Emperor Basil I the Macedonian (). No fewer than 66 members of the Senate and aristocracy were involved, including the commander of the imperial bodyguard, the Hetaireia, and prominent noblemen. The conspirators intended to strike on the Feast of the Annunciation, but the conspiracy was betrayed by Kourkouas' chamberlain. The emperor conducted a public trial of the conspirators in the Hippodrome of Constantinople, condemning them to beatings and forcible tonsure; the hairs left were burned. Then the emperor led the festive procession for the Feast of the Annunciation, forcing the conspirators to march behind him naked. They were then banished and their possessions confiscated. The sources differ on the exact dating of the affair, with Theophanes Continuatus and John Skylitzes (who follows Continuatus) placing it around 877/78, but modern scholars place it in 886. Skylitzes even gives the leader of the conspiracy the name Romanos instead of John, but the other chronicles are clear in attributing these events to John. Skylitzes' account may be a confusion from the name of John's son (possibly also the name of his father). John was the namesake grandfather of the distinguished 10th-century general John Kourkouas.

K. Goodwin) (born 9 January 1951) is a spiritual and occult teacher, sidereal astrologer, and author guiding a small number of students. In 1972, he joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in Madison, Wisconsin. After the disappearance of the founder of the Hare Krishna movement, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, he was one of the first reformers who battled against the \\"ISKCON\\" zonal acharyas in 1978 and 1979. He is co-founder of the Vaishnava Foundation, and, working out of the United States, remains an exponent of devotional teaching, opposing all the deviations that emerged within the Hare Krishna movement after the demise of its Founder-Acharya A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Biography Born in early 1951, he was immediately put up for adoption and raised in Glenview, Illinois, as well as Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by foster parents. He became sports editor of The Daily Cardinal while majoring in journalism at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the early 1970s. Joining the Hare Krishna movement in February, 1972, he received Harer Nama initiation from his guru, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in September, 1972 at the rural ISKCON compound just outside Moundsville, West Virginia and was given the spiritual name of Kailasa Candra dasa (hereinafter, Kailasa). He secured brahminical initiation in July, 1974, while serving at the Evanston, Illinois temple. In the 1970s, Kailasa ran Midwest college preaching programs throughout Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana.Kailasa Candra dasa in 1980'sAfter the disappearance of the founder of the Hare Krishna movement, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, he was one of the first reformers who had battled against the \\"ISKCON\\" zonal acharyas in Vrindaban, India, in 1978 and 1979. Asked by the leader of that reform group, Kailasa was the devotee who compiled a lengthy position paper against the zonal acharya system. He was one of the first members to be excommunicated from the now changed \\"ISKCON\\" movement, and, in the 1979 \\"ISKCON\\" GBC resolution, all the \\"ISKCON\\" centers were warned about his activities. In the late spring of 1985, Kailasa was contacted by Sulochan dasa, who was in need of an editor for his tracts that were meant to be combined into an eventual book. Kailasa traveled with him throughout America in the fellow's converted van during the summer and early autumn of that year, completing editing that for his godbrother. In May 1986, at the behalf of one of the ‚ÄúISKCON‚Äù zonals, Kailasa's friend Sulochan was assassinated in Los Angeles while in his van. In January, 1988, Kailasa co- founded The Vaishnava Foundation in Sacramento, California. He is the author of over one hundred articles published on the Vaishnava Foundation's websites, along with thirty video presentations. Philosophy / Thought In Western Vaishnava circles, Kailasa is known as a staunch critic of corruption that emerged after his spiritual master's departure. In the following quote, he depicts the importance of exposing such deviations: \\"Based in no small measure upon deductions rooted in Prabhupada's teachings, this document will work to concentrate the mind. The big lies will be broken down. Once you are awakened from their intoxicating influence, the dismantling of the bogus philosophies underpinning them will inexorably proceed via the domino effect. The psychic shackles will fall off, and you will experience a natural freedom of mind and intelligence conducive to the development of genuine Krishna consciousness.\\" Bibliography = Publications = Vyasa Puja Homage (ISKCON Honolulu), 1975 Vyasa Puja Homage (ISKCON Honolulu), 1976 ‚ÄúOn the Measure of Our Conviction‚Äù treatise, 1980 ‚ÄúGuru is Never Appointed‚Äù tract, 1981 ‚ÄúOverall Considerations of the Bona Fide Spiritual Master‚Äù tract, 1981 ‚ÄúShastric Considerations Concerning the Monitor Guru‚Äù tract, 1981 ‚ÄúThe Appointment That Never Was‚Äù tract, 1981 ‚ÄúThe Spiritual Master Never Deviates from Shastra‚Äù tract,1981 ‚ÄúWhen You Hear Someone Say in the Following Way‚Äù tract, 1981 \\"On Sufficient Guidance\\" treatise, 1992 \\"The Positive Alternative\\" treatise, 1992 \\"The Proof Of One Tooth\\" treatise, 1998 \\"How The Impersonal Philosophy Can Stand?\\" treatise, 1998 \\"Myth of The 'Final Order'\\" treatise, 1998 \\"A Closer Look at Siksa-Guru\\" treatise, 2007 \\"To Expose the New Theory\\" treatise, 2008 \\"Srila Prabhupada Was Makara Lagna\\" treatise, 2009 \\"To Expose the New Theory\\" treatise, 2009 \\"GBC: The Gods Who Failed\\" treatise, 2010 \\"Boon-dog-ill: Beyond \\"ISKCON\\" Triumphalism\\" treatise, 2010 \\"A Closer Look at Siksa-Guru\\" treatise, 2011 = Books = Reclaiming the Lost Tarot, (book), 2009; Advanced Primer of Sidereal Astrology, (book), 2009; Messages From Nostradamus Revealed, (book), 2009; Buddhi-yoga and System Ouspensky, (book), 2009; Tattva-viveka, (Sanskrit book), translation into English, 2011; Beyond Institutional Gurus, Initiations, And Party Men, (book), 2019; = Editing work = Bryant, Steve: _The Guru Business_ (self-published book) Editor, 1985 References/Notes External links *https://www.therealexplanation.org *https://www.returntosquareone.com *https://www.vfoutreach.com Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:American Hare Krishnas Category:American male writers Category:American astrologers Category:American spiritual teachers Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st-century American writers ","title":"Kailasa Candra dasa"},{"id":"61036519","text":"Tapestries is a collection of Magic: The Gathering short stories published by Wizards of the Coast in 1995.

Singer's goal was \\"to unite accuracy and even literalness with due regard to English idiom, and to the simplicity of style and diction which befits the language of prayer\\". The siddur became popular not only due to the quality of its translation, and its relatively compact size, but also because the Montefiore family paid for its production, allowing it to be sold for one shilling.

Actes Sud published the novel, Mathieu's second. An English translation by William Rodarmor was published by Hodder & Stoughton and Other Press in April 2020. The novel portrays the lives of teenagers and adolescents in peri-urban areas of eastern France in the 1990s, and deals with the consequences of deindustrialization. The novel received positive reviews from the literary press. It received the Prix Goncourt on November 7, 2018.  Writing and development Mathieu explored deindustrialization in the east of France in his first book, the hardboiled novel Aux animaux la guerre, published by Actes Sud through their ‚ÄúActes Noir‚Äù imprint. Mathieu chose to engage further with this topic for his second novel, although focusing on children born near the end of the 1970s, who were teenagers in the 1990s.Nicolas Blondeau, ¬´ Depuis le Goncourt, j‚Äôapprends √† dire non ! ¬ª, Le Progr√®s, 10 d√©cembre 2018.Michel Pourcelot, ¬´ Leurs enfants apr√®s eux : en passant par la Lorraine sinistr√©e ¬ª, site de Force ouvri√®re, 2 d√©cembre 2018.

Tantardini worked as an apprentice blacksmith under his older brother before he enlisted in the Italian armed forces after World War I broke out in Europe. He served in the front lines but the German forces captured him and moved him from camp to camp before he and some others managed to escape their captors. He resumed his work after his return to his home province but soon set himself on entering the missions, after reading old magazines that detailed the work missionaries did. He entered PIME in 1921 and a short while later in 1922 was sent to the Burmese missions where he would spend the next seven decades. Tantardini became beloved in the missions and travelled either on foot or horseback to reach the various missions, with some located in the jungles or mountains. He became known as the \\"Blacksmith of God\\" for his work as a blacksmith in the local communities but also did work as an electrician or carpenter in order to cater to the needs of the mission communities. He toned down his work after he turned 85 when his superiors asked him to retire and he spent this time continuing to visit at a less frequent rate and reciting rosaries often in his free time. His death in 1991 prompted calls for his beatification in 1994. Initial steps to activate the cause came following this before the cause launched in mid-2000; he became titled as a Servant of God as a result. The cause culminated on 11 June 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Tantardini had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. Life Felice Tantardini was born on 28 June 1898 in Introbio in the Como province as the sixth of eight children to Battista Tantardini and Maria Magni. His parents were devout and would recite the rosary each evening together with their children. His brothers included Giuseppe and Primo and a sister was named Anna. He finished third grade twice in order to improve his basic education and in 1908 started to work as an apprentice blacksmith under his older brother Giuseppe in his workshop. In 1911 his father died in a tragic accident ‚Äì a flashflood that overran his electrician workshop that had been built on the bank of the Troggia Waterfall. Tantardini later recalled that his father's bones were not found until 1914. In 1915 he began work at the Ansaldo Power Plant in Genova. He enlisted in the Italian armed forces after World War I broke out in Europe and was exempted from active service since he worked in a corporation that was war-supporting and contributed to the Italian war effort. The Italian defeat at Caporetto on 24 October 1917 saw him recalled and after two months of training he was sent to the front lines in January 1918. But just 48 hours later the German soldiers captured him and 60 others and led them to Vittorio Veneto where he was assigned to work on the railroads. He suffered from hunger and the cold weather that affected his health. He was relocated often from one concentration camp to another until he managed to escape his captors; he was sent to Udine and Gorizia before being sent to Belgrade in Serbia. During his time as a prisoner of war he slept on the ground and had two meals consisting of beetroots cooked in water, with transgressions prompting a whipping for prisoners who angered the guards. He planned his escape in December 1918 alongside four others, crawling through a drainage channel before reaching Greece and then returning home. In June 1919 he arrived home via a ship to Taranto and a train ride to Lecco. He spent just over two weeks recovering before being sent for three months to take the Greek island of Kalymnos . He returned to his home province and to his work as a blacksmith, and then as an electrician with the Camisolo Mine Limited corporation. During this time he began to read copies of The Catholic Missions detailing the work undertaken in the missions, after his little sister Anna kept them aside just for him. This matured in his mind the desire to enter the missions himself. He began dreaming about the missions at the time his boss thought about having him wed one of his three daughters. His mother supported his decision but warned him to make sure that his choice was genuine and not just a passing phase. On 20 September 1921 he entered the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions in Milan and on 24 June 1922 received the religious garb (from the Superior General Father Giuseppe Armanasco) before receiving the mission crucifix on 15 August (received alongside ten others with Fr. Vincenzo Marcuzzi and Br. Sandro Perico going with him to the missions). Ten months after having entered PIME he was sent to the Burmese missions as a religious brother. He departed from Venice on 2 September 1922 and after two weeks of travelling spent time in Bombay in India. From there he went to Calcutta, Rangoon, and then to Toungoo by train.  Burmese missions  This began what would be seven decades working in the Burmese missions. Tantardini was enthusiastic about being able to contribute to the local communities and also being able to contribute to proclaiming the Gospel. He sometimes was asked to do catechesis for children and older people, though he was better known for working with anvil and hammer as a blacksmith, and became known as the \\"Blacksmith of God\\". He also did work from time to time with lepers. The Blessed Clemente Vismara ‚Äì whom Tantardini knew ‚Äì once said that \\"Brother Felice's weakness is the pipe\\", for he was known to smoke with the pipe more often than not. In Leikth√≤, Burma, in 1924 he was struck with severe abdominal pains but the nearest hospital in Toungoo was over 30 miles from where he was. The single possible method for taking him there was on a shoulder stretcher and as he was loaded on it he insisted on going to the chapel to the altar dedicated to the Blessed Mother to ask for her intercession. He ended up getting out of the stretcher with his pain gone and threw his cane down exclaiming that she had healed him. The people called this event a miracle. During the Japanese bombings after their invasion during World War II, he almost died several times but would tend to the people affected during this time despite his own fear at the bombings. He returned to his homeland only once, April 1956 to January 1957, in order to rest and regain his strength. While there he learnt the girl his old boss wanted him to marry had died without having ever married. He visited Rome where he first met his niece, then a novice in a convent. On 1 May 1956 he travelled to Saint Peter's Basilica to see Pope Pius XII at a public event alongside two priest companions, and also visited several Roman churches. From Rome he went to Milan to see his siblings and was ill in Milan for a brief time. Upon his return to Burma he was first assigned to the Toungoo mission but moved from mission to mission whenever and wherever he was called to do his work. He travelled long distances often on foot or horseback under the hot sun or in torrential downpours and he sometimes came across guerilla groups, or even wild beasts and animals such as snakes and tigers. He became noted for his constant efforts to improve the lives of local communities: he constructed churches and convents as well as schools and orphanages. Tantardini also oversaw the construction of hospitals and bridges to help improve the local infrastructure. He did work too as a carpenter or plumber and also did farming and orchard gardening while also working as a bricklayer. In 1973 the Italian Government awarded him the title \\"Master of Labor\\" due to his \\"contributing to honoring Italian work abroad\\". His superiors ‚Äì including Bishop Giovanni Battista Gobbato (also from PIME) ‚Äì asked Tantardini to retire after he turned 85 since his superiors believed he was pushing himself too much and was growing too frail. It was during this retirement period that his bishop asked him to write about his own life. He did so, recounting his works in the missions and how he coped during the Japanese invasion and bombings during World War II, while also writing about the struggles between the different ethnic groups. His retirement did not see him cease working for he continued to help people in local communities. The priest Father Mariano once said that Tantardini was \\"enthusiastic about his work, and his infectious enthusiasm about the work on hand would become contagious and affect all those who worked with him\\". Mariano also referred to Tantardini as \\"serene\\", and as one who could sometimes be seen \\"joking around\\" with others. Tantardini died on 23 March 1991; he had been ill for some time and in his final months could no longer stand. His remains were buried in the garden of the disabled center Holy Infant Jesus in the Payaphyu suburb. His tomb became a place for pilgrimage after his death with miracles reported at the tomb. Beatification process His death prompted insistent calls for a beatification process to be activated in 1994, and initial steps were taken in the time after to ensure the cause could be opened. Further steps were taken in 1999. The cause was introduced on 23 May 2000 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat (no objections to the cause) edict and titled Tantardini as a Servant of God. The diocesan process for the cause was inaugurated in the Taunggyi archdiocese under Archbishop Matthias U Shwe on 2 August 2001 who also closed it sometime later. The documentation and witness testimonies (gathered from people in Taunggyi and Milan) were sent to the C.C.S. in Rome for additional assessment; the C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 28 January 2005 as having adhered to their rules for conducting diocesan processes. The postulator (the officials leading and coordinating the cause) compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2011 for evaluation. In June 2016 the PIME Superior General Father Ferruccio Brambillasca met with the then-C.C.S. Prefect Cardinal Angelo Amato to discuss the current state of the cause. Amato sent him a letter not long after telling Brambillasca that the Positio would be examined in the first half of 2018. The nine theologians issued their unanimous approval of the cause on 22 May 2018. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members approved the cause sometime later. Tantardini became titled as Venerable on 11 June 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged the fact that Tantardini had practiced heroic virtue throughout his life. The first postulator for the cause was Fr. Piero Ghetto (until his death in 2018) and the current postulator since 2018 is the PIME priest Giovanni Musi.

Active for over 40 years, he is noted for his work with the American Museum of Natural History, the Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the Boston Museum of Science. American Wapiti family group, with a background by Wilson, at the American Museum of Natural History. Life and career James Perry Wilson was born in Newark, New Jersey, the youngest of six children only three of which lived into adulthood. Wilson attended Newark public schools. Even though he began painting early in his life, he never took formal painting classes, instead learning painting techniques from a family friend. Wilson attended Columbia University, graduating with an architecture degree in 1914Columbia University Architecture School Annual, 1914. Thereafter he found work as a draftsman and designer for the architectural firm, Bertram Goodhue Associates\\"\\"Biographical Data on James Perry Wilson\\", AMNH Archives. Wilson‚Äôs training as an architect influenced his diorama painting technique; he focused on careful observation of source material, illusionistic representation of three dimensions, and mathematical precision. The Great Depression brought Wilson‚Äôs architecture career to an end in 1932. In 1933 he met an employee of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), who encouraged him to show his landscape paintings to the director of diorama construction, James L. ClarkMacClintock, Dorcas,\\"James Perry Wilson and the Art of Background Painting,\\" Discovery Magazine, Vol 12 No. 1, 1976. Clark was interested at once, but asked for the opinion of the diorama painter, William R. Leigh, who approved of Wilson's work. James Perry Wilson, unpublished interview with Rudolph Freund and Rudolph Zallinger at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, circa 1958, AMNH Archives and Manuscripts. Wilson was subsequently hired in 1934 as an apprentice diorama painter at the AMNH \\"Biographical Data on James Perry Wilson\\", AMNH Archives. Wilson began working in the African Hall under Leigh's supervision, though Leigh severed his connection with the museum shortly thereafter, leaving Wilson responsible for subsequent dioramas. Wilson painted a total of eleven backgrounds in the African Hall of the American Museum of Natural History before moving to the North American Mammal Hall, where he painted several dioramas and established a reputation as a talented artist among the museum‚Äôs administration. During World War II, diorama work slowed at the AMNH. Wilson was given an 18-month leave of absence from 1944 to 1945 to paint three dioramas for the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History\\"\\"Biographical Data on James Perry Wilson\\", AMNH Archives. He returned to full time work at the AMNH in 1946. From 1943 to 1955, Wilson wrote and illustrated a monthly astronomy article for a young adult audience in Junior Natural History Magazine, published by the AMNH and for the science series, ‚Äô‚ÄôThe World We Live in‚Äô‚Äô, published by ‚Äô‚ÄôLife Magazine‚Äô‚Äô. Later career and death In 1957, after painting thirty-eight dioramas at the AMNH, Wilson relocated to New Haven, Connecticut to paint four more dioramas for the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and one diorama at the White Memorial Foundation's nature center in Litchfield, Connecticut. The Canadian Museum of Nature hired him in 1963 through 1965 to paint four Canadian bird dioramas. The background shell of the Point Pelee diorama was taken off display and stored in the early 1990s. It was given to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 2010. A new foreground was constructed before it was installed at the Peabody. Wilson worked at the Boston Museum of Science from 1966 to 1975. There, he painted six small New England dioramas and one miniature dinosaur diorama. He was welcomed as an artist in residence by the director, Bradford Washburn and the exhibit staff. Wilson painted a total of 57 dioramas over a 42-year career in museums. He died in August, 1976. Style and technique Wilson relied on substantial reference material when designing and painting a diorama background. He collected reference photographs from the specific locations he intended to depict, in addition to painted color references. When asked why he didn't use photographs exclusively, he replied, \\"Because you can't rely on photographs, even the best color film, to record the color exactly as the eye sees it. Color film tends to increase contrast. So I use my field paintings as an over-all check.\\"\\"Interview\\" Wilson sought to remove the artist's subjective emotional interpretation by letting his many references guide his brush. He transformed the prevailing subjective practice of oil painting by aligning painting aesthetics with science‚Äôs fact-based intentions for the dioramas. Wilson sought to make the artist transparent. In his own words derived from Latin, ars celare artem, (\\"art conceals art\\"). His work is characterized by a desire to imitate nature so closely that his work is seen as depicting actuality. His colleague, Ray deLucia recalled \\"the look on his face when someone questioned an effect he had included in a background painting. It was not a look of anger but more of disbelief that his conclusion should be doubted.\\" Ray deLucia, letter to Dorcas MacClintock September 16, 1976MacClintock, Dorcas, \\"James Perry Wilson and the Art of Background Painting\\" Personal life Wilson was a lifelong bachelor. The prominent bird artist, Louis Agassiz Fuertes (1874-1927), was Wilson's first cousin.Hillouse, Margaret, 1924, The Descendants of Rev. James Hillhouse, New York, Tobias A. Wright, pp. 290-291.

Basil was the son of the magistros Romanos Skleros, a son of the rebel general Bardas Skleros who became a close advisor to Emperor Basil II ().. He married with Pulcheria, a sister of the future emperor Romanos III Argyros (). The couple had a daughter, who already during the reign of Basil II married another future emperor, Constantine IX Monomachos ().. Basil himself is first mentioned during the reign of Constantine VIII (), when he held the rank of patrikios.. During this time, he came into conflict with Presian, the governor of the Bucellarian Theme, that escalated to the point that they exchanged blows. Emperor Constantine banished both men to the Princes' Islands: one of them to the island of Plate, the other to Oxeia. Skleros was accused of planning to flee, and was blinded as a result; according to John Skylitzes, Presian narrowly escaped the same fate himself, but was released instead. When Romanos III came to the throne, however, Basil was rehabilitated and promoted to magistros. According to one view, he was further promoted to vestes and given the post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme. At some point, he also appears to have conspired against his brother- in-law, as both he and his wife were banished from Constantinople by Romanos. The arrogance of Basil Skleros and his relatives, who ruled their estates almost as independent lords, is severely criticized in the Peira of the contemporary legal scholar Eustathios Rhomaios.

The aircraft's designation refers to eight lift fans, no tilt rotors and one tractor propeller. It is being designed as one electric VTOL proposal for Uber Elevate. Design and development The design uses wings as it provides greater speed and range over wingless designs, plus the ability to take off and land on a runway, if required. The aircraft features a cantilever high- wing, a five-seat, enclosed cabin under a bubble canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear, eight vertical electric lift motors powering shrouded fans mounted in two underwing pods and a single electric motor engine in a tail- mounted tractor configuration. It will be capable of flying on six of the eight lift fans. The design incorporates fly-by-wire controls and will be capable of autonomous flight (flight without a pilot) from delivery. The design incorporates the ability to see-and-avoid other aircraft and emphasizes a low noise signature for acceptance in urban areas. The design used in-house designed batteries, with four of varying designs to avoid design flaws. It also used energy-absorbing seats and seat belts. Also each of the eight lift fans operates at a different rpm and therefore frequency to reduce noise pitch peaking. The aircraft will have a range of at a cruising speed of or more.

The UK government is defeated by 432 votes to 202. * 12 March: The Second meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement with the UK government is defeated again by 391 votes to 242. * 14 March: The UK Government motion passes 412 to 202 to extend the Article 50 period. * 20 March: Theresa May requests the EU extend the Article 50 period until 30 June 2019. * 21 March: The European Council offers to extend the Article 50 period until 22 May 2019 if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by 29 March 2019 but, if it does not, then the UK has until 12 April 2019 to indicate a way forward. The extension is formally agreed the following day. * 29 March: The original end of the Article 50 period and the original planned date for Brexit. Third vote on the Withdrawal Agreement after being separated from the Political Declaration. UK Government defeated again by 344 votes to 286. * 5 April: Theresa May requests for a second time that the EU extend the Article 50 period until 30 June 2019. * 10 April: The European Council grants another extension to the Article 50 period to 31 October 2019, or the first day of the month after that in which the Withdrawal Agreement is passed, whichever comes first. If the UK does not hold European Parliament elections in May 2019 (it did) it will leave on 1 June 2019. * 23 May: The UK holds elections to the European Parliament which sees, on the one hand, the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage being the largest party winning 29 seats and, on the other hand, parties advocating a new referendum securing 37 seats and obtaining 55.5 percent of the vote. The largest of these was the strongly anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats led by Vince Cable coming second with 16 seats, ahead of the more ambiguous Labour Party on 10. The Conservatives fell to 4 seats on 8.8 percent, the biggest ever defeat of a governing party in a UK- wide election. * 24 May: Theresa May announces that she will resign as Conservative Party leader, effective 7 June, due to being unable to get her Brexit plans through parliament and several votes of no-confidence, continuing as prime minister while a Conservative leadership contest takes place. * 18 July: MPs approve, with a majority of 41, an amendment to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 that blocks suspension of Parliament between 9 October and 18 December, unless a new Northern Ireland Executive is formed. * 24 July: Boris Johnson accepts the Queen's invitation to form a government and becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the third since the referendum. * 25 July: Both Houses of Parliament go into summer recess on 25 July until 3 September. * 28 August: Boris Johnson announces his intention to prorogue Parliament in September. The Queen would deliver a speech from the throne on 14 October to begin a new session. This was controversial because it would limit the time for Parliament to pass legislation ahead of the Article 50 deadline of 31 October. The Queen approved the timetable at a meeting of the Privy Council at Balmoral. * 3 September: A motion for an emergency debate to pass a bill that would rule out a unilateral no-deal Brexit by forcing the Government to get parliamentary approval for either a withdrawal agreement or a no-deal Brexit. This motion, to allow the debate for the following day, passed by 328 to 301. 21 Conservative MPs voted for the motion. * 4 September: The Benn Bill passed second reading by 329 to 300; a 22nd Conservative, Caroline Spelman, voted against the Government position. Later the same day, MPs rejected Johnson's motion to call an October general election by a vote of 298 to 56, which failed to achieve the two-thirds Commons majority needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Labour MPs abstained from the vote. * 9 September: The Government again loses an attempt to call an election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Dominic Grieve's humble address, requiring key Cabinet Office figures to publicise private messages about the prorogation of parliament, is passed by the House of Commons. Speaker John Bercow announces his intention to resign as Speaker of the House of Commons on or before 31 October. The Benn Bill receives Royal Assent and becomes the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Parliament is prorogued until 14 October 2019. Party conference season begins, with anticipation building around a general election. * 24 September: The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom rules unanimously that Boris Johnson's decision to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament was unlawful, and that the prorogation itself is therefore null and of no effect. * 25 September: Parliament is recalled. * 2 October: The government publishes a white paper outlining a new plan to replace the Irish backstop, involving regulatory alignment across the island of Ireland but retaining a customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. A further, shorter, prorogation is announced from 8to 14 October. * 7 October: The Outer House of the Court of Session in Edinburgh dismisses a case brought by petitioners, including Joanna Cherry, seeking a court order compelling Boris Johnson to write the letter requesting an extension that could be required by the Benn Act, in view of statements by Johnson and his representatives which it was said indicate that they might attempt to circumvent the Act. The Court accepted an assurance to it by the government's lawyers that Johnson would write the required letter. The Court also dismissed a request for an order preventing the government from frustrating the Benn Act, for example by asking another EU member state to veto a requested Brexit extension, after the government's lawyers undertook to the Court that no such action would be taken. There is to be an appeal to the Inner House of the Court of Session. Separately in the Inner House, the petitioners request a ruling that, if such a letter comes to be required and Johnson fails to write it, the Court will write the letter itselfan unusual procedure that is available only in Scotland. * 9 October: The Inner House delays its decision until 21 October, stating: \\"Until the time for sending the letter has arrived, the PM has not acted unlawfully, whatever he and his officials are reported to have said privately or in public. The situation remains fluid. Over the next two weeks, circumstances will inevitably change.\\" * 14 October: Parliament returns for the Queen's Speech. * 17 October: The UK and European Commission agree on a revised withdrawal agreement containing a new protocol on Northern Ireland. The European Council endorses the deal. * 19 October: A special Saturday sitting of Parliament is held to debate the revised withdrawal agreement. The prime minister moves approval of that agreement. MPs first pass, by 322 to 306, Sir Oliver Letwin's amendment to the motion, delaying consideration of the agreement until the legislation to implement it has been passed; the motion is then carried as amended, implementing Letwin's delay. This delay activates the Benn Act, requiring the prime minister immediately to write to the European Council with a request for an extension of withdrawal until 31 January 2020. * 19 October: Prime minister Boris Johnson sends two letters to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk: one, which is stated to be from the UK prime minister but is not signed, refers to the requirements of the Benn Act and requests an extension until 31 January 2020; the other, signed personally by Johnson and copied to all Council members, states that it is his own belief that a delay would be a mistake and requests support from the president and Council members for his continuing efforts to ensure withdrawal without an extension. The letters are delivered by the British permanent representative in Brussels, together with a cover note signed by himself which affirms that the first letter complies with the Benn Act.Letters and note: unsigned letter and cover note; signed letter. * 21 October: The Speaker refuses the government's request for a new vote on the withdrawal proposal, applying the convention that a motion that is the same \\"in substance\\" as an earlier one cannot be brought back during the course of a single parliamentary session. * 21 October: In the Inner House of the Court of Session, the petitioners concede that Johnson has fulfilled the requirement of the Benn Act that he write seeking an extension, but contend that his second letter negates the first. The Court refuses the government's request to dismiss the case, deciding that the case should remain before the court \\"until it is clear that the obligations under [the Benn Act] have been complied with in full\\". On 7 October, government lawyers had undertaken to the Outer House that Johnson will abide by all requirements of the Act. These include responding to the EU's reaction to his letter. Any breach of that undertaking could place Johnson in contempt of the Court. * 21 October: The government introduces in the Commons the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill with the title: \\"A Bill to Implement, and make other provision in connection with, the agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union which sets out the arrangements for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU\\". * 22 October: The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is approved (second reading) by 329 votes to 299, but the accompanying \\"programme motion\\", to get all stages of the bill completed in three days and thus before 31 October, is defeated by 322 votes to 308 after MPs object that this would not allow time for adequate consideration. In Brussels, EU Council president Donald Tusk says he will recommend to the Council that it approve the UK's request for an extension. * 24 October: Prime Minister Boris Johnson asks Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to support on 28 October a government motion for a general election on 12 December (in order to achieve the two- thirds majority required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act). Corbyn continues to insist that a no-deal Brexit must first be \\"off the table\\". * 25 October: Following a meeting of the European Commission, a spokesperson says that \\"the EU 27 have agreed to the principle of an extension and work will now continue in the coming days\\", and that they plan to decide on the date without an emergency summit. * 28 October: European Council agrees to extend the Brexit deadline until 31 January 2020the third extension. * 28 October: Government motion for an election on 12 December is defeated by 299 to 70, short of the two-thirds majority required by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, after most Labour MPs abstain. Government withdraws the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill and states an intention to introduce on 29 October \\"a short bill for an election on 12 December\\". * 28 October The Liberal Democrats and the SNP announce support for an early election and propose their own one page bill for an election on 9 December. * 29 October: Government introduces the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019: ::(1) An early parliamentary general election is to take place on 12 December 2019 in consequence of the passing of this Act. ::(2) That day is to be treated as a polling day appointed under section 2(7) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. :This measure would circumvent the Fixed-term Parliaments Act without amending it. :The Labour leadership supports the bill in principle, satisfied that the extension to 31 January (now confirmed) has taken the prospect of a no-deal Brexit \\"off the table\\". A government attempt to prevent non-government amendments fails and an amendment from opposition parties to alter the date to 9 December is defeated. Amendments from opposition parties to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 and to allow resident EU nationals to vote are ruled out by the Deputy Speaker (chairing) as not within the \\"scope\\" of the bill; the government had threatened to withdraw the bill if they were allowed. MPs pass the bill unamended by 438 votes to 20, with more than 100 Labour members abstaining and 11 voting against. * 30‚Äì31 October: The Early Parliamentary General Election Bill is passed unamended by the House of Lords and, upon receiving royal assent the following day, becomes law as the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019. * 6 November: Parliament dissolved. * 12 December: General election held in which the Conservative Party gain an 80-seat majority in parliament. * 20 December: The Withdrawal Agreement passed its second reading in the House of Commons in a 358‚Äì234 vote.  2020  President of the European Parliament David Sassoli signs the Withdrawal Agreement on 29 January 2020 * 22 January: the Withdrawal Agreement Bill proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson passed the UK parliament after several amendments proposed by the House of Lords were rejected by the House of Commons in a vote of 342‚Äì254. The Lords later decided not to propose further amendments, thereby allowing passage of the bill to the Queen to receive royal assent. * 23 January: the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 received royal assent. * 23 January: The constitutional committee in the European Parliament backs the withdrawal agreement, setting the expectation that it would be approved by the entire parliament. * 24 January: Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, and PM Boris Johnson sign the withdrawal agreement. Von der Leyen and Michel signed the agreement in the Europa Building in Brussels and then sent the agreement in a diplomatic bag to 10 Downing Street in London for Johnson to sign the agreement. * 28 January: Chris Pincher becomes the last UK Minister to attend an EU meeting in Brussels when he was present at the General Affairs Council. * 29 January: The European Parliament gives its consent to the Council of the European Union to conclude the withdrawal agreement by 621 votes to 49. This also was the final time that MEPs from the United Kingdom sat in the European Parliament. * 30 January: The Council of the European Union concludes ratification of the withdrawal agreement.Press send for Brexit: EU seals UK withdrawal by email, The New York Times, 30 January 2020.

These urinals consist of seven ornamentally decorated, green-painted cast iron wall segments, arranged onto an octagonal floor plan, provide standing room for seven men, and the eighth side is the entrance. The roof is crowned by an eight-sided ventilation hood. In front of the entrance, there is a privacy screen of at least three segments. The design for these urinals came from the city councillor Carl Theodor Rospatt in 1878. In 1920 there were about 142 of these urinals in Greater Berlin, and today about a dozen preserved specimens can be found. History The predecessor of this design, whose formation was prompted by the then police chief Guido von Madai in the early 1870s and had to give way to the Caf√© Achteck, had the colloquial name \\"Madai-Tempel\\". The emerging competition in 1889 was a rounder, but still octagonal, model from the entrepreneurial group Asten and Hirschberg, known locally as \\"Rotunde\\" because of the similarity to a rotunda. The first two Rospatt-type plants were erected in 1879 on Weddingplatz and Arminiusplatz. The officially named Waidmannslust-type soon took over the neighbouring regions of Berlin. Initially, public toilets were male-only, and it was only around the year 1900 that there were women's toilets in public.Sch√∂ner sp√ºlen. Wohin auch der Kaiser zu Fu√ü ging: Eine Stadtf√ºhrerin erz√§hlt die Geschichte der Berliner Toiletten. In: Zeit Online, 7. Oktober 2010. The design from 1878 continued to be manufactured into the 1900s, for instance, the Cafe Achteck at Stephanplatz in Stephankiez was erected in 1899. By 1900, there were at least a hundred across Berlin. Until 1997, all facilities were the responsibility of Berliner Stadtreinigung, and since then the street furniture supplier Wall AG. Since the early 1990s, some copies have been renovated and are back in operation, including, since 2000, the unit at Stephanplatz. The historically appropriate restoration of a Caf√© Achteck cost about 250,000 DM. Some of the facilities have been rebuilt differently, with separate male and female modern-style toilets set up within the old ironworks. There are now only about a dozen remaining, as well as two much larger rectangular examples. The large rectangular example at Schlesisches Tor U-Bahn station has been repurposed as a hamburger bar.

Before meeting with Joseph Smith, Caswall was already aware of the psalter's contents and intended to use the request as a means of exposing Joseph as a fraud.  History  Henry Caswall wrote a book titled Three Days in Nauvoo (also called The City of the Mormons) in which he gives an account of presenting Joseph Smith with an old Greek psalter to translate. Caswall was aware of Smith's claims about the translation of The Book of Mormon from Reformed Egyptian and the Book of Abraham from Egyptian Papyri and wanted to test the truthfulness of these works. The Greek psalter's contents were well established prior to the meeting and contained a common Greek translation of the Psalms. After looking the manuscript over, Joseph Smith identified the manuscript as being a Dictionary of Egyptian Hieroglyphics and pointed to the capitalized letters saying that they were hieroglyphics followed by their meanings in Reformed Egyptian. Caswall went on to claim that this was evidence of Smith's position as a fraud. A local newspaper, The Warsaw Message, also mentioned the event and stated that multiple supporters of Smith were also present during the event. Smith was originally reluctant to look over the manuscript but after he claimed its connection to Egyptian hieroglyphics the room was in \\"great astonish\\". After the excitement in the room began to cool down, Caswall revealed that the contents of the manuscript was nothing more than a common Greek psalter. Smith then \\"stepped out\\" of the room.  Criticism of the event  Joseph Smith may have had enough knowledge of the Greek language to avoid an incorrect identification of the Greek psalter. On November 20, 1835, Oliver Cowdery gifted Smith a Hebrew and Greek Lexicon. Smith also reported that he spent time studying the Greek language at home which would have been prior to his encounter with Henry Caswall.

The three approaches defined by the model include scaling through replication or cloning (the ‚ÄúX axis‚Äù), scaling through segmentation along service boundaries or dissimilar components (the ‚ÄúY axis‚Äù) and segmentation or partitioning along similar components (the ‚ÄúZ axis‚Äù). History The model was first published in a book in the first edition of The Art of Scalability. December 15th, 2009. The authors claim first publishing of the model online in 2007 in their company blog. Subsequent versions of the model were published in the first edition of Scalability Rules in 2011, the second edition of The Art of Scalability in 2015 and the second edition of Scalability Rules in 2016. Model overview The X axis of the model describes scaling a technology solution through multiple instances of the same component through cloning of a service or replication of a data set. Web and application servers performing the same function may exist behind a load balancer for scaling a solution. Data persistence systems such as a database may be replicated for higher transaction throughput. The Y axis of the model describes scaling a technology solution by separating a monolithic application into services using action words (verbs), or separating ‚Äúdissimilar‚Äù things. Data may be separated by nouns. Services should have the data upon which they act separated and isolated to that service. The Z axis of the cube describes scaling a technology solution by separating components along ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù boundaries. Such separations may be done on a geographic basis, along customer identity numbers, etc. X axis X axis scaling is the most commonly used approach and tends to be the easiest to implement. Although potentially costly, the speed at which it can be implemented and start alleviating issues tends to offset the cost. The X Axis tends to be a simple copy of a service that is then load balanced to either help with spikes in traffic or server outages. The costs can start to become overwhelming, particularly when dealing with the persistence tier. =Pros of X axis scaling= *Intellectually easy *Scales transactions well *Quick to implement =Cons of X axis scaling= *Cost (multiple database copies) *Does not address caching *Does not address organizational scale Y axis Y axis scaling starts to break away chunks of monolithic code bases and creates separate services, or sometimes microservices. This separation creates clearly defined lanes for not only responsibility and accountability, but also for fault isolation. If one service fails, it should only bring down itself and not other services. =Pros of Y axis scaling= *Allows for organizational scale *Scales transactions well *Fault isolation *Increases cache hit rate =Cons of Y axis scaling= *Intellectually hard *Takes time to implement Z axis Z axis scaling is usually looking at similar use cases of data. Whether that be geographic in nature or how customers use your website, or even just a random modulus of your customer dataset. The Z Axis breaks customers into sequestered sections to benefit response time and to help eliminate issues if a particular region or section should go down. =Pros of Z axis scaling= *Intellectually easy *Scales transactions well *Can provide fault isolation *Can improve response times =Cons of Z axis scaling= *Takes time to implement *Does not address organizational scale *Requires increased automation to reduce systems overhead References Category:Computer architecture Category:Computational resources Category:Computer systems Category:Engineering concepts ","title":"Scale cube"},{"id":"61037931","text":"Penstemon multiflorus is a species of plant in the family Plantaginaceae.

It was launched in June 2017 following the success of Electioncast, a podcast that had covered that year's general election. Originally aired on radio, it was announced in June 2019 that Brexitcast had been commissioned as a television programme for BBC One. It was the first BBC podcast to be commissioned for television. The first televised edition of Brexitcast aired on BBC One and the BBC News channel on 12 September 2019, and was later briefly accompanied by the daily Electioncast which returned as a daily podcast for the duration of the 2019 general election. In January 2020 it was announced that Brexitcast would be renamed Newscast after the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union on 31 January. The final edition of Brexitcast was released on 30 January 2020. The first edition of Newscast aired on 6 February. Online, episodes of Brexitcast had amassed cumulative 8 million downloads by September 2019 and over 18 million by January 2020, and its first edition on BBC One attracted over a million viewers. It has received mixed reviews from critics, with a reviewer for The New Statesman praising it for its impartiality, and The Guardian for its presenters' adeptness at explaining the subject matter. However, some have been more critical, particularly of the television version, which a reviewer for The Glasgow Herald described as dull. Overview Recorded on a weekly basis, the show takes a look at issues relating to Brexit, the term for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining the subject to listeners in an informative but light-hearted fashion. The series styles itself as providing its audience with \\"geeky Brexit gossip\\". The podcast is presented by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Europe editor Katya Adler, Europe correspondent Adam Fleming, and political correspondent Chris Mason. In addition to the weekly recordings, the team have also recorded special editions of the podcast to tie-in with specific events, and on topics requested by viewers who seek further information on a specific subject. Kuenssberg has said of these editions, \\"Because of the way that you can use social media now?...they know when we are taping and so we can say, 'What do you want to know?‚Äô Other times, people will request an episode and we‚Äôll be, like, ‚ÄòOh God, have we got time to do it?'\\". The televised edition is recorded on the day of broadcast, before being transmitted later that evening. It is aired on the BBC News Channel at 9.30pm, before being repeated on BBC One at 11.35pm. The programme is edited and broadcast within two hours of the end of its recording. History =Electioncast= Prior to Brexitcast, a similar podcast titled Electioncast was launched in 2017 to cover that year's general election. It returned again at the start of the campaign for the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Presented by the Brexitcast team, Electioncast aired on the BBC News Channel at 21:30 as well as in the same podcast feed as Brexitcast every weekday for the duration of the election, except for Thursdays when Brexitcast aired as normal. =Podcast= Brexitcast was launched in June 2017 as a podcast, replacing Electioncast which had started on 8 May 2017 to cover the 2017 general election. It is available to download from the BBC Sounds app and also aired on BBC Radio 5 Live. The first episode of Brexitcast was released on 19 June 2017 after the conclusion of the election. On 5 December 2018 the Brexitcast team of presenters appeared on BBC One's The One Show to answer Brexit-related questions from the audience ahead of a planned vote in the House of Commons. In May 2019, Brexitcast was the recipient of the Listeners‚Äô Choice Award at the British Podcast Awards. =Television series= On 13 June 2019, the BBC announced that it would be produced as a television programme for BBC One, launching in September. Brexitcast airs in a late-night Thursday slot after Question Time, and replaced This Week, which ended after sixteen years on air following presenter Andrew Neil's decision to leave the series. It was also confirmed that Brexitcast would continue to be available as a downloadable podcast, with extra editions recorded to coincide with significant events. Brexitcast is the first BBC podcast to be commissioned as a television programme, and follows other podcasts such as The Ricky Gervais Show and My Dad Wrote a Porno in making the transition to screen. The first televised edition of Brexitcast was aired on 12 September 2019, debuting firstly on the BBC News Channel at 9.30, before being shown on BBC One at 11.35pm. The first edition was watched by an average one million viewers. On 10 October, the journalist and musician Rhodri Marsden appeared as a guest on the programme where he debuted tracks from his Brexit-inspired disco concept album The Hustle. It then appeared on the iTunes UK Album Chart, where it quickly began to outsell ABBA Gold. In November 2019, a discussion on Brexitcast about \\"shitposting\\" attracted some media comment after Kuenssberg gave an incorrect description of the term. On 23 January 2020 it was announced that Brexitcast would be renamed Newscast following the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union on 31 January. The edition aired on 30 January, the day before the UK's exit, was recorded before a live audience at London's BBC Radio Theatre. The final edition of Brexitcast, recorded as a podcast for radio and titled \\"Over and Out!\\", was released on 1 February 2020. The first edition of Newscast aired on 6 February, and while continuing to discuss Brexit, also focused on other events such as the 2020 Irish general election. Reception At the time of its BBC One launch, the Brexitcast podcast had been downloaded over eight million times, and the Financial Times reported that it regularly topped both the weekly podcast and iTunes charts, particularly editions recorded after significant events in the Brexit process. By the end of January 2020 it had received eighteen million downloads. Writing about Brexitcast for The New Statesman in March 2018, Antonia Quirke described its style as \\"fairly relaxed\\" and commented on its impartiality: \\"Probably the best thing about Brexitcast is that there isn‚Äôt a great deal of lamenting going on\\". Prospect magazine named the podcast among the best podcasts for June 2019, describing it as \\"a funny, up-to-the-minute and behind-the-scenes guide to Brexit from the BBC‚Äôs political correspondents\\". Charlotte Runcie, writing in the Daily Telegraph, described Brexitcast as \\"excellent...funny, well-informed and refreshingly sane\\", but questioned whether the format would transfer successfully to television. The i newspaper included it in a list of podcasts to \\"help guide you through Brexit and beyond\\". The television version has received a mixed reaction from critics. Following the broadcast of the first television edition of Brexitcast, Alison Rowat of the Glasgow Herald questioned the logic of creating a TV version, which she described as \\"watching four people sitting in a row. Very dull\\", and she compared it unfavourably with the podcast version, concluding \\"a quick check on the podcast version of the TV show on Sounds showed Brexitcast was still better in sound than in vision\\". Joel Golby of The Guardian has emphasized the show's nerdish nature, describing Brexitcast as \\"TV for people who can recite their credit score from memory\\", and he was largely positive in his review of its content: \\"While it isn‚Äôt pretty, it is clever: an informed conversation about the day‚Äôs politics by people who do that smart-person snicker instead of an actual real laugh\\".

Career  Some of Schullers writings ‚Äì notably those about Freddie King, Buster Smith, and Lightnin' Hopkins ‚Äì have been cited in academic and encyclopedic publications. According to a Buddy magazine staff editor, Schuller provided blues pianist Boston Smith (n√© Boston Beverly Smith; 1907‚Äì1989) (Buster Smith's brother) with an epitaph worthy of his achievements. He also was an update editor of the 2002 revised edition of MusicHound Blues: The Essential Album Guide (Schirmer Trade Books / Omnibus Press). At the time of his death, he had been writing a book, Scorning All Borders, covering 30 years of writing about Texas jazz and blues artists.  Early years  Schuller was born in Salem, Ohio, to Frederick Kane Schuller (1908‚Äì1956) and Mary Louise Layden (maiden; 1912‚Äì2005). Tim's father, who had been a newspaper journalist, died when he was seven. As a teenager, Tim attended Salem High School, graduating in 1967. During his senior year, he was the feature editor of the Salem Quaker, his high school newspaper. Tim went on to study at Kent State University at Salem, but did not graduate. In Ohio, Schuller had worked as a musician (playing guitar), a factory worker, and a stringer reporter. Schuller then moved to Chicago with his childhood friend from Salem, Tom \\"Mot\\" Dutko (n√© Thomas Lawrence Dutko; 1949‚Äì2017), a blues drummer. Who went on to record with Little Al Thomas and the Crazy Horse Band, Billy Branch, and Eddie Shaw. In Chicago, Schuller played with Robert Lockwood Jr. and John Brim. Dutko also played drums for Big Walter Horton, Sunnyland Slim, Homesick James, Jimmy Walker, Erwin Helfer, and Eddie Taylor. Schuller moved to Dallas around 1977 and briefly embarked in the record business. In 1977, he was worked at Peaches Records & Tapes at Cole and Fitzhugh Avenues, Dallas. Ken E. Shimamoto (born 1957), a music journalist in Dallas worked there with him. In 1980, Schuller was assistant manager at Sound Town at the Valley View Mall in Dallas. Over the next 35 years, Schuller contributed to the following newspapers, periodicals, and records: Periodicals and newspapers # Guitar Player, Living Blues, Blues Access # The Met (Dallas' arts & entertainment weekly) # Southwest Blues # DownBeat # Buddy magazine # Texas Jazz # Juke Blues # Coda # Crazy Music (the journal of the Australian Blues Society) # D Magazine # Dallas Morning News, # Dallas Observer # Texas Observer # Contemporary Keyboard # Texas Highways # Akron Beacon Journal Discography # Lucky Seven Records # Black Top # Trix # Wolf Records (de) (Vienna, Austria) # Bullseye Blues # Fedora Records # Blind Pig # TKO Magnum Music # Blue Moon # Continental Blue Heaven (distributed by Harmonia Mundi) # Cannonball Records (nl) 29110 # AudioQuest Music # TopCat Records # Mayhem Records # JSP  Affiliations  * In 1987, Schuller ‚Äì with Chuck Nevitt (n√© Charles Franklin Nevitt; 1956‚Äì2015) (record collector), Brian \\"Hash Brown\\" Calway (n√© Brian Everett Calway; born 1955) (blues musician) ‚Äì founded the Dallas Blues Society.

She is best known for her memoir on Albert Einstein, her friend and teacher while studying at the University of Berlin. Biography =Early life= Esther Polianowsky was born in Zhytomyr to an observant Jewish timber merchant. In 1917, she was accepted to the Kiev University to study mathematics. As civil war and anti-Semitic pogroms spread across the Russian Empire, however, her father forbade her from leaving alone for Kiev. Polianowsky fought in the Ukrainian national resistance during the Russian Civil War, thereupon escaping to Mandatory Palestine in January 1920 to join a group of pioneer agricultural workers. She succeeded in securing travel documents for her widowed mother and four siblings, and paid a team of Polish foresters to lead them to the Polish border in secret. From there, Esther guided them to Palestine. =Education= The Cavendish Laboratory in 1927 Despite the volatile situation for Jews in Germany, Esther and her sister Fania elected to relocate to Berlin in the summer of 1922 to resume their education. Polianowsky's application to the University of Berlin was sponsored by Albert Einstein, whose recommendation gained her admission to the Faculty of Physics, in spite of her not having completed an entrance examination. While his pupil, Polianowsky developed a personal relationship with Einstein. He encouraged her writing after reading her article in the Frankfurter Zeitung recalling the murderous pogroms in Zhytomyr by Petliura's Cossacks during Orthodox Christmas of 1918. As the Nazi Party rose to prominence in Germany, Polianowsky was encouraged by Einstein to leave the country after graduation. He provided her with a recommendation to pursue doctoral work at the Cavendish Laboratory under Sir Ernest Rutherford. Her scholarship, funded by Jewish philanthropist Redcliffe Salaman, was conditioned on her later going to Israel to teach. Although this plan did not come to fruition, she grew close to the Salaman family and married Redcliffe's eldest son Myer, a pathologist. Polianowsky left the Cavendish in the summer of 1928, her PhD incomplete, to devote her life to her family. =Early career= At the suggestion of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Esther began writing fiction for an English audience. She published her first novel, Two Silver Roubles, in 1932, only six years after arriving in England knowing only Russian, German, and Hebrew. From 1940, Myer and Esther Salaman shared a large home in Cambridge with their close friends Frances and Francis Cornford, along with their respective children. When Myer joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1943, Esther and her children stayed on with the Cornfords. That same year, she and Frances together published a anthology of poems from the Russian, which included biographies of Kruykov, Pushkin, Blok, and Akhmatova. The two families often retreated to Ringstead, Norfolk, where the Cornfords maintained a cottage attached to the Darwin family's six-storey Hunstanton Mill, constructed in 1850. From 1936 the Mill served as a debating retreat for the Theoretical Biology Club, a group of organicists and theoretical biologists that included John D. Bernal, Max Black, J. B. S. Haldane, Dorothy and Joseph Needham, Karl Popper, C. H. Waddington, Bertold Wiesner, Joseph H. Woodger, and Dorothy Wrinch. In 1956, Frances Cornford sold the property to the Salamans. Salaman's reminiscences of Einstein were broadcast on the BBC Third Programme in 1955, and her second novel, The Fertile Plain, was published in 1956. =Later life= In 1948, Myer Salaman was hired as Director of the Cancer Research Department at the London Hospital Medical College and the family moved to London. Esther Salaman's later works include A Collection of Moments (1970), a study of involuntary memory, and The Great Confession (1973), which explores the use of memory by Aksakov, De Quincey, Tolstoy and Proust. She published memoirs of Albert Einstein and Paul Dirac in Encounter in 1979 and 1986 respectively. She died on 9 November 1995 at the age of 95.

La censure a fait son retour au paysNet Lawyer from Russia: ¬´Censorship Actually has Returned to the Country¬ª  JNews, June 17, 2014. In June 2015, when we start talking out loud about the application of censorship by the government in Russia, Izvestia publishes an article of the Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky, entitled \\"Who does not feed his culture, will go to feed the foreign army \\". At the head of the article, the Minister of Culture declares that the state must not only subsidize culture, but also follow the content created through these subsidies, and systematically encourage only projects that reflect the values of the conservative majority of the world. population. Medinski emphasizes the negative effect in Russia of political censorship and considers that the role of the bureaucracy is to guarantee the financial, administrative and legal viability of the rules according to which the state does not limit the artist in his creation, but controls if its production is not offensive to citizens. As an instructive example, the minister cited the dismissal of the director of the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater Boris Mesdritch, after the scandal of Timofei Kuliabin's staging of Richard Wagner's opera Tannh√§user (opera). The fact is that Russia has put in place a special procedure for productions and productions that are inscribed or withdrawn from the state budget accounts, and the fact is also that the State orders works on theme, says Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the President of Russia. Reacting to these ministerial directives, director Andrei Zvyagintsev said in October 2016 that: \\"Orderly officials castrate artistic creation\\". The laureate of the Venice Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival call Peskov's principles of public art market rules, which means that officials spend state money on films and performances in the interests of the public. of the state itself. With this conception, Dmitry Peskov forgets it is not their money available to its officials, but taxpayers' money.Le mauvais r√™ve des commandes de l'√âtat.

He describes these phenomena as a return to Russia of the infamous censorship of Stalin's time in the USSR. There are people in Russia who say they are offended and try to tell the artists what to do. This is reflected by the popular artist of the USSR Oleg Tabakov. About this public censorship he notes that \\"these people got the idea that if the government does not censor, then they have to control the art themselves\\". Tabakov is convinced that the methods of these spies of censorship do not create the conditions for the appearance of an appropriate art. The censorship of Russian creativity against Raikin, Zviaginsev and Tabakov was also condemned by Vladimir Vladimirovich Pozner, Yevgeny Mironov (actor) and Sergey Bezrukov. The problems related to the arrival of censorship and the moralization of artistic creation were discussed in November 2016, at a meeting of theater directors, at the Deputy Director of the Administration of the President of Russia, Sergei Kirienko. Among the statements of support for censorship media attention has focused on the provocative statements of biker Aleksandr Zaldostanov and those of Ramzan Kadyrov at the head of Chechnya. The idea that Zaldostanov wants to pass is that freedom is only a scheming of the spirit of evil: \\"The devil always wants to try by freedom! But under the guise of this freedom Raikin wants to turn the country into a sewage dump. He is supported by Kadyrov unhappy that \\"a certain caste arrogates to itself the right to offend the religious feelings of tens of millions of Orthodox and Muslims by stating that in art everything is allowed\\". On August 1, 2014, the bloggers law came into effect, which, even after the adoption of another text, makes it possible to apply prison sentences for extreme cases. The Freedom House organization ranks Russia in countries where the internet is not free. According to this organization, the situation of the Russian Internet (Rounet) tends to worsen in the area of censorship. The main restrictions on the Internet in the Russian Federation are related to anti-terrorism measures. Censorship monitors and blocks, where appropriate, LGBT communications, Donbass-related topics, extra-parliamentary political opposition, nationalist-oriented messages, and child pornography. All over Russia, according to the same organization, blockages of unwanted sites occur, destruction of their content, pressure from political and economic authorities on online publications, or even cyberattacks against independent media31. About 60% of Russians believe that censorship is essential, but only 25% of respondents for personal websites and publications, according to the Levada Analytical Center. The number of supporters of censorship on the internet tends to grow in Russia In November 2016, the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinski said that in Russia there is no form of censorship and that the discussions on this issue come from the financial, family, creativity of prominent people in the culture Russian. On 2 December 2016, at a joint meeting of the Council for Culture and Arts and the Council for the Russian Language, President Vladimir Putin states that \\"the principle of the freedom of artistic creation is absolutely immutable\\". He considers that \\"attempts to interrupt performances and exhibitions are totally unacceptable and he guarantees that force will remain in the law to prevent such acts\\". At the same time, Putin reminds artists that there is a border between the offending epate and the artistic activity. Censorship on television The level of political censorship of the television is very high, considers the cinema critic Evguena Petrovskaya. Television does not cover the mass protests of December 2011 in a timely manner and only communicates them after one week35. On Russian television, there is no political satire (satire is an important sign of democracy) because power does not accept that on television. This is what caused the problems of the NTV (Russia) after presenting a doll in the image of Putin in a show of the style Guignols info. On 25 November 2010, during the award ceremony of the Vladislav Listiev Prize, presenter Leonid Parfyonov analyzed the situation of censorship on TV in Russia. According to Parfyonov, criticism of senior state officials has become impossible, and the authorities are only represented in the funeral tradition. Or you have to talk about them for good or nothing. Media attention has also turned to censorship of private facts related to film production by federal television channels. In June 2013 the director, screenwriter Nikolai Dostal (Ru) sends an open letter to the director general of the Pan-Russian State TV and Radio Company VGTRK Oleg Dobrodeev (Ru), about the broadcast of his film The Disciplinary Battalion (Chtrafbat) on \\"Rossiya 1\\". According to Dostal, throughout his film words were roughly deleted even in a prisoner prison song. Several sexual scenes have been cut. Dostal points out that all cases of disrespect for the film's author are not recorded and that he feels bitterness and shame in the face of such coarse, petty and hypocritical censorship. Director Vladimir Mirsoev also faced censorship. The second channel bought the movie The man who knew everything, in which he participated as director and co-producer. During the broadcast, the key phrase I am your bitch was needed to understand the plot, but it was removed and no one asked for permission. Mirsoev considers censorship on television comes from the direction of the chain. According to the director, the special services also monitor television and the artistic truth seems a very hard notion to accept by these people. Filmmakers have to take their side of censorship, as their only real chance to break through and make money is to sell their film to the federal channel. In July 2013, Rossiya 24 deputy editor Alexander Orlov claimed that he had been fired for publishing social media support for opponent Alexei Navalny. In December 2016, presenter Konstantin Syomin said that cuts had been made by Petersburg TV-5 of the epic film Liberation, for political and ideological reasons. Among these cuts, some concerned the evocation of Joseph Stalin in a positive light. Cinema censorship One of the first cases of censorship in the history of Russian cinema in the Russian Federation is the protest by the Russian Orthodox Church against the broadcast, on May 30, 1997, by the NTV television deeply believing and Catholic director, Martin Scorsese, The Last Temptation of Christ. At the request of the Orthodox Church, the broadcast has been postponed for several months, finally taking place on November 9, 1997. As part of the broadcast, Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow holds a press conference in Moscow under the influence anger. A brochure The Antichrist in Moscow, devoted entirely to the diffusion of the film and the events related to it, is distributed. The film is described as the most blasphemous film created in the last decade. The magnitude of unprecedented blasphemy, the pamphlet says, is proven by the tens of millions of people who are affected by the film. During the 2012 expert appraisal, experts from the Russian Institute of Culture, however, found nothing in Scorsese's film that could be criticized. A new wave of censorship is emerging, which is linked to the policy led by the Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinski, from his appointment to this post in 2012. The film critic, former director of the Guild of film critics, Russian filmmaker Viktor Matisen is provided as an example of refusal to broadcast for censorship the movie Clip of the director Ma√Ø Miloche and the film Order of forgetting of the director Hussein Erkenov, but also the requirements of modification of the scenario of the project of Alexander Mindadze Gentil Hans, dear Piotr (–ú–∏–ª—ã–π –ì–∞–Ω—Å, –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–π –ü–µ—Ç—Ä), considered as a factual modification of the constitutional rules on censorship. Adopted in 2014, the law prohibiting the use of uncensored (obscene) language is applicable in cinemas and is interpreted as an introduction to censorship in Russia. According to these new requirements, director and director Valeria Ga√Ø Germanica's film Yes and Yes (\\"–î–∞ –∏ –¥–∞\\") saw its dialogues changed to become law-abiding, while the non-standard vocabulary was part of the artistic conception of melodrama and was dictated by the content and logic of the developed subject. In November 2014, the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation refused to fund the Artdokfest International Documentary Film Festival. His reasons are based on the fact that the festival's president, director Vitali Manski, would be, according to the minister, an opponent of the state from a political point of view. Minister Medinski said he would not be funding the festival for as long as he was minister of culture. On the other hand, in October 2016, there was the premiere of the film Twenty-eight Panfilovs (in), whose scenario is based on the story of the exploits of the twenty-eight Panfilovs, a holy Soviet legend of the Second World War. The Ministry of Culture financially supported this project. On November 4, 2016, the film went on the channel Rossiya 1. The first screenshot of the patriotic novel The wall, from the pen of Minister Vladimir Medinski himself, was also funded by the Ministry of Culture. In 2016, representatives of the Tsarist Cross public movement shared their thoughts on the film Matilda by director Aleksei Outchitel on Tsar Nicholas II's relationship with ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska. According to them, this is an anti-Russian and anti-religious provocation in the field of culture. Following a request from the Duma of the Russian Federation Natalia Poklonskaya addressed to the Prosecutor General, the film was examined, but no offense was found. In January 2018, the Franco- British comedy, The Death of Stalin, was the subject of a cancellation of the distribution right by the Ministry of Culture because, in the words of the President of the Public Council near the Ministry of the Yuri Poliakov culture, the film showed traces of ideological struggle54. The RBK Group, the experts, the artists and the politicians have considered the withdrawal of the distribution rights of this film the day before its release in theaters as a purely ideological and politic intervention on the part of the Minister of Culture. Minister Medinski, meanwhile, said that the people of the previous generation, but not only them, can consider this film as \\"an insulting mockery of Soviet society, of the USSR military and victims of Stalinism \\".

On October 2012, at the contemporary Erarta Museum in St. Petersburg, a solo scene of Lolita from Vladimir Nabokov's novel was interrupted. The artist Leonid Mozgovoy, who played the role, other actors and organizers were threatened with retaliation by the indignant Cossacks of St. Petersburg. They also sent angry letters to the media. The activists demanded the ban of this blasphemous spectacle which, in their opinion, \\"falls under the application of the legislation on propaganda on homosexuality and pedophilia\\" . In November 2013, orthodox activists interrupted the play An Ideal Husband at the Anton Chekhov Art Theater, demanding that this sacrilege be stopped. This scandal is the work of an activist at the Moscow Mission Center named Daniel, a certain Dmitri Tsorionov Enteo, who claims to find sodomy and blasphemy on the stage of this theater. In July 2015, a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church, the rector of Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University, Dmitry Smirnov, and a group of Orthodox activists of more than 100 people organized a rally during the celebration. of the 20th anniversary of the radio station Rain Money in Moscow. After appearing on stage, they attacked the director, closed the equipment and interrupted the anniversary concert, claiming that the music disturbed the prayer while the nearest church was one kilometer away from the radio station. In July 2016, in St. Petersburg, modest and puritanical citizens demanded that the nakedness of the copy of Michelangelo's statue of David be hidden with a cap62. In 2016, the most important events were the removal of the repertoire of the Tannh√§user opera at the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater; the interruption in Omsk of the performance of the rock show Jesus Christ Superstar; the interruption of Khorovod (La ronde) by Polish director Piotr Chalchi after a play by the Austrian playwright Arthur Chlinder after the intervention of the Omsk63 eparchy, the examination by the prosecutor of the show All shades of the blue of the Satiricon Theater founded by Konstantin Raikin \\", concluded the qualification of diversion of minors. We can also mention the closure in Moscow, at the Center of the Lumi√®re brothers, an exhibition of the American photographer Jock Sturges Without embarrassment, exposing photos of girls and girls in the context of living in naturist community. Photo frames were sprinkled with urine and carvings were broken. Reacting to the censorship of the work Jesus Christ Superstar, because of the intolerance of part of the Orthodox public and his clergy to the interpretation of the image of the Savior, on November 1, 2016, the Russian Orthodox Church called to allow the display of this rock show Jesus Christ Superstar. By its very nature this work has no dogmatic or canonical authority but instead attracts people in churches where it is possible to discuss and reflect on whether this work can be accepted or not and why on the basis of Holy Scripture Censorship in literature In November 2013, the media reported that when prosecutors checked the literature in the Stavropol libraries, they found books in school libraries that had nothing to do with the educational mission of the school. They were books on mysticism, eroticism and horror. The Senior Deputy Prosecutor of Stavropol Krai (Kurbangali Charipov), monitoring the enforcement of juvenile laws, discovered 215 violations of the law on the protection of children and on harmful information. He demanded the withdrawal of the works of Sergei Yesenin and Vladimir Nabokov. After this information was published in the media, the Prosecutor General of Russia denied that such an inspection took place, but he dismissed the prosecutor of Stavropol Sharipov. On June 13, 2014, the teachers' edition, entitled September 1st, declared that it was no longer publishing for political reasons. \\"Civil liberties have been steadily decreasing, while the school is increasingly being run in inhuman conditions\\" File:Sergey Yesenin 2.jpgSergei Yesenin in 1919 File:Sue Lyon Tony Rome 1967.jpgSue Lyon ; Sue Lyon in Tony Rome, 1967 Internet censorship Before 2009, the Internet remained relatively free in Russia but reached only 27% of the population.
