History Constructed on the site of the Governors‚Äô residence during the Spanish occupation of Gibraltar, the library was officially opened in 1804 by the Duke of Kent. In 1823 the library's fees were \\"100 hard dollars\\" which was paid by the 150 proprietors of the \\"Commercial Library\\". Each proprietor was entitled to borrow one large or three smaller books or an entire set of a novel for one to two weeks. In exchange they had to also pay 16 dollars per year. This was a commercial affair and membership of the library could be bought or sold. The thirteen members of the committee were elected annually and the library was to be open seven days a week with both winter and summer hours. The library served as the headquarters and archive service of the Gibraltar Chronicle, the world's second oldest English language newspaper. The Library was established for and by the officers of the Garrison of Gibraltar. It has remained a private entity run by a Trust for over two hundred yearsGibraltar Garrison Library Minute Books and 200th Anniversary Commemorative Booklet, 2004 up until, September 2011, at which point the Library was transferred to the Government of Gibraltar. Description The Garrison is a library of 45,000 books, including many rare volumes. This library exists to hold the collection which includes good coverage of the subjects of culture and travel. The library was started to occupy officers stationed in Gibraltar. It has an excellent local history collection. Many lithographs and art prints are held here and many of the furnishings have interesting historical backgrounds. In 2006 the editorial offices of the Gibraltar Chronicle moved to new premises in Watergate House, and the print works relocated in 2007 to New Harbours. The Chronicle's archive currently remains at the Garrison Library, as does the records of the more recent Panorama newspaper. The dragon tree in the library's front garden is thought to date from the Spanish occupation when the plant was introduced to Gibraltar by mariners who brought the seeds from the Canary Islands.

It has a land area of 142.59 km¬≤ (55.053 sq mi) and a population of 6,822 as of the 2000 census. Washington State Ferries serves Friday Harbor, which is San Juan Island's major population center, the San Juan County seat, and the only incorporated town in the islands.  History  The name \\"San Juan\\" originates from the 1791 expedition of Francisco de Eliza, who named the archipelago Isla y Archipi√©lago de San Juan to honor his patron sponsor, Juan Vicente de G√ºemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. One of the officers under Eliza's command, Gonzalo L√≥pez de Haro, was the first European to discover San Juan Island. During the Wilkes Expedition, American explorer Charles Wilkes renamed the island Rodgers Island; the Spanish name remained on British nautical charts and over time became the island's official name. The island saw seasonal use for salmon fishing. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) established the first permanent, non-native settlement on the island on December 13, 1853, with the intention of creating a sheep farm. The island was also occupied by Native Americans, many of whom arrived seasonally for fishing. Both the British and Americans asserted control of the island. A small force of American soldiers was sent to the island over concern for this issue and with Native American raids on American settlers. The territorial dispute over this island and the rest of the San Juan Islands heightened when an American settler shot an HBC pig, starting the Pig War in 1859. The dispute was finally resolved in favor of the Americans in 1872. Island life San Juan Island has a number of weekly newspapers, and two online daily news sites: the San Juan Islander and the Island Guardian, . The Island is dotted with numerous farms, and is a tourist-driven economy. The island hosts two substantial marinas, one in Friday Harbor, the other in Roche Harbor. One often sees tall ships and large yachts in the marinas. The Island has a hospital, the Peace Health Peace Island Medical Center. Transportation to the Island is by boat, Washington State Ferries, seaplane or by conventional aircraft. If traveling by seaplane, Friday Harbor is serviced by Northwest Seaplanes and Kenmore Air, both longtime operators in the area. The Friday Harbor Airport is on the outskirt of town. Outside of Friday Harbor, the only major commercial establishment resort is the village of Roche Harbor, located on the northwest side of the island. San Juan Island NHP English Camp San Juan Island NHP American Camp Other landmarks are the old English and American Camps at opposite ends of the island, which together comprise the San Juan Island National Historical Park, which commemorates the 1859 Pig War. Interpretive centers and reconstructed buildings, formal gardens, etc. recall the history of early European settlement in the area. Friday Harbor ferry landing The University of Washington runs Friday Harbor Laboratories, a marine research lab and campusFriday Harbor Labs outside Friday Harbor. The campus has been extant since 1909 and has dormitories, a food service, and classrooms for holding lectures. San Juan Island is considered a \\"small town\\" community, in that it is relatively quiet rural living with little distractions or incidents aside from tourism. One notable resident would be Lisa \\"Ivory\\" Moretti, a retired female professional wrestler of World Wrestling Entertainment fame. Miel Bredouw, comedian, former Vine star and current Host/Co-Creator of podcast Punch Up the Jam, grew up on the island. It has a number of attractions including The Whale Museum; a contemporary Art Museum building completed in 2015; the San Juan Community Theatre; the Sculpture Park (near Roche Harbor); the San Juan Historical Museum; and Lime Kiln Point State Park where visitors can watch orca pods swim by. Lime Kiln Park is so named because it housed a lime kiln and is home to the historic Lime Kiln Light. Camping is also available around the island. Lime Kiln Lighthouse Friday Harbor Schools Public schools are operated by the San Juan Island School District #149. It operates four schools: Friday Harbor Elementary School, Friday Harbor Middle School, Friday Harbor High School, Griffin Bay Schools (alternative high school, parent-partner home school program, online courses, and virtual school), and Stuart Island School (K-8). There are also two privately operated schools.Schools in Jan Juan Island, retrieved 2012-04-03 Ecology The waters surrounding San Juan Island are home to a variety of species including red sea urchins and pinto abalone. Though no commercial fishing of abalone has ever been allowed in this area, recreational fishing of abalone was outlawed in 1994. The National Marine Fisheries Service listed pinto abalone as a Species of Concern in 2004.  Attractions  There are a few small, family-run aquaculture farms in the San Juan Islands including Westcott Bay Shellfish Co, where visitors can buy oysters, clams and mussels and see shellfish farming operations.

Early life He was born Anthony Gimigliano in New York City. His father, Antonio, was a machine operator, factory worker and a nonpolitical anarchist. Gregor served as a volunteer in the U.S. Army. He attended and graduated in 1952 from Columbia University and thereafter served as a high school social science teacher while working for his advanced degrees. Prior to founding the IAAEE, he published several articles on race science and syndicalism for Oswald Mosley's The European and Corrado Gini‚Äôs Genus. Gregor's first article in the latter was a defense of Gini's theories, and the two subsequently became friends and collaborators until Gini's death in 1965. Eugenics and philosophy In 1959, Gregor joined with Robert E. Kuttner to found the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics (IAAEE), where Gregor acted as secretary. According to Gregor, the organization was founded to restore \\"an intellectual climate in the U.S., and throughout the Western World, which would permit a free and open discussion of racial ... problems.\\" The organization was funded by segregationist Wickliffe Draper to oppose the civil rights movement.Tucker, William H. (2002). Our Source of Funds: The Campaign against Civil Rights. in The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund. University of Illinois Press, As part of this group, Gregor was also an assistant editor of, and contributor to, Mankind Quarterly, the organization's journal. During this period he undertook anthropological field studies of aboriginal people in Central Australia, and similar studies in South Africa and in the southern United States. In 1960, he obtained employment as a philosophy instructor at Washington College, and in 1961 he received his doctorate at Columbia as an Irwin Edman Scholar and with Distinction in History after his dissertation on Giovanni Gentile. Gregor became assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Hawaii from 1961 to 1964. He became an associate professor of philosophy at the universities of Kentucky and Texas between 1964 and 1967. Gregor joined the Political Science Department at the University of California at Berkeley in 1967 where he remained until his retirement. Study of fascism Gregor was part of a movement of scholars in the 1960s who rejected the traditional interpretation of fascism as an ideologically empty, reactionary, antimodern dead end. He claimed Italian Fascism owed a major debt to European ideological currents in sociology and political theory. Gregor described fascism as a coherent and serious theory of state and society, and argued that it played a revolutionary and modernizing role in European history. His theory of generic fascism portrayed it as a form of \\"developmental dictatorship.\\" \\"Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship\\" (pub. 1980; republished 2008) by A. James Gregor, p. xii. Since the 1970s, Gregor spent most of his academic research on the study of fascism and it is for this that he is best known. In 1969, he published The Ideology of Fascism: The Rationale of Totalitarianism; in 1974, he wrote The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics. Since then he published other works on the subject, such as Mussolini's Intellectuals, The Search for Neofascism, and Marxism, Fascism, and Totalitarianism. Gregor argued that scholars do not agree on the definition of fascism, stating in 1997 that \\"Almost every specialist has his own interpretation.\\"A. James Gregor, Interpretations of Fascism (1997) p 19. He argued that Marxist movements of the 20th century discarded Marx and Engels and instead adopted theoretical categories and political methods much like those of Mussolini.Gregor, The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics (1974). In The Faces of Janus (2000) Gregor asserted that the original \\"Fascists were almost all Marxists‚Äîserious theorists who had long been identified with Italy's intelligentsia of the Left.\\"Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century (2000), p. 20. In Young Mussolini (1979), Gregor describes Fascism as \\"a variant of classical Marxism.\\"Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism (1979), p. xi. According to Gregor, many revolutionary movements have assumed features of paradigmatic Fascism, but none are its duplicate. He said that post-Maoist China displays many of its traits. He denied that paradigmatic Fascism can be responsibly identified as a form of right-wing extremism.Gregor, The Search for Neofascism: The Use and Abuse of Social Science (2006). International relations Gregor said that he was committed to the American form of democratic liberalism, as he said that is the most effective system of government and the most likely to endure. In the 1960s, Gregor held numerous workshops and lectures to convince policymakers and academics of the supporting the US role in the Vietnam War. During the 1970s and 1980s Gregor served as an uncompensated adviser to Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos. His 1986 book, The China Connection: U.S. Policy and the People's Republic of China and his 1987 follow-up, Arming the Dragon: U.S. Security Ties with the People's Republic of China, discussed Sino-American relations. In 1989 he wrote In the Shadow of Giants: The Major Powers and the Security of Southeast Asia. Gregor was named to the Oppenheimer Chair of Warfighting Strategy 1996‚Äì1997 at the Marine Corps University in Quantico. Gregor translated some of the works of Italian Fascist philosopher Giovanni Gentile into English, together with a commentary on Gentile's political thought. Until his retirement in 2009, he taught a series of political science courses on revolutionary change, Marxism, and Fascism at UC Berkeley. In 2014, Gregor published Marxism and the Making of China. In 2016, his work, \\"Reflections on Italian Fascism\\" was published in an English and Italian edition. His present project is an analytic study of the transformative revolution that shaped the twentieth century. In 2014, Princeton University Press incorporated his volumes, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, and The Fascist Persuasion in Radical Politics, among the books in their \\"Princeton Legacy Library.\\" Academic evaluations Gregor was made a national Guggenheim Fellow; a Senior Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Social Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; H. L Oppenheimer Professor at the Marine Corps University, Quantico, Virginia; and a Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Gregor wrote an influential early comprehensive survey of existing theoretical models of fascism.Roger Griffin, \\"Old Hat, New Bird,\\" Review of Politics (2000), 62: 844‚Äì847 . According to Andreas Umland in The American Historical Review, \\"A. James Gregor has, for half a century, been one of the major makers and shapers of the discipline of comparative fascism.\\"See review by Andreas Umland in The American Historical Review (2013) 118(3) p. 1484. . Andrew Muldoon in Canadian Journal of History says, \\"Over a long and distinguished career A. James Gregor has advanced some controversial interpretations of political ideologies. In particular, he holds that the Italian Fascist regime is best understood as a \\"developmental dictatorship,\\" distinct from Nazism in key ways; a thesis that has proven surprisingly influential since 1945.\\"See review by Sean Kennedy in Canadian Journal of History (2013) 48(3) p. 575. Shortly after Gregor's death an extensive critical survey of his works on Fascism was published as a monograph by social scientist Phillip Becher.Phillip Becher, Faschismusforschung von rechts: A. James Gregor und die ideozentrische Deutung des italienischen Faschismus, K√∂ln: PapyRossa, 2020. However, Gregor's studies remain among the most respected on the subject.

Lanzhou University was one of the first universities entitled to enroll Bachelor Master‚Äôs and Doctoral degree candidates in 1981. Lanzhou University is one of the top ten universities in contributions to academic publications in international journals frequently cited by ongoing research from around the world. History Lanzhou University had formerly been one of China's premier institutions of higher learning with its position as the best university in Northwestern China. Lanzhou University maintains one of China's top ten Ph.D. programs in physics, chemistry, atmospheric sciences and geography and highly ranked programs in information science, biology, botany, mathematics, history, media, ecology and Chinese literature. Lanzhou University Staff Housing Campus Lanzhou University's main campus is a ten- minute walk from Lanzhou Train Station. Parts of the campus are considered aesthetically pleasing, particularly in comparison to the rest of highly industrialized Lanzhou, with a small park and man-made pond. Although the old dormitory buildings were in disrepair, the campus is undergoing an overhaul of its image. New dormitories are being built, with some finished already. Lanzhou University employs instructors from outside China (United States of America, France, New Zealand, Russia and Japan) in foreign languages (e.g. English, French, Russian and Japanese) and in physics, as well as frequently inviting guest lecturers from a variety of fields. It also has a popular Friday gathering within the gardens of the university to allow students to practice their English language skills. Non-university students are generally allowed to attend such gatherings. Primary laboratories Lanzhou University has three primary laboratories and analytical testing facility sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Education and deemed as high importance to the state. Laboratory of Arid Agroecology The laboratory was founded in 1991 under ratification of the Planning Commission of China and engaged in arid agriculture ecology research. The Laboratory of Arid Agroecology is the only lab engaged in arid agriculture ecology research under the Chinese Ministry of Education. The lab has been highly developed on the basis of the authorization to confer bachelor, masters, doctorate and post-doctoral degrees through the financial aid of the World Bank loan. Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry The Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry was one of the first state key laboratories ratified by Planning Commission of China. It was founded in December 1987, open to visiting scholars and scientists from both within China and abroad. It is one primary laboratories to cultivate talents for organic chemistry. The researches of the laboratory focus on organic molecular chemistry of special function, especially in the field of basic research on active organic molecules. Open Laboratory of Applied Magnetism Created in 1993 by the Chinese Ministry of Education, this is an open laboratory conducting research in the field of Applied Magnetism. The lab is chiefly engaged in studies on applications of perpendicular magnetic recording. The laboratory also conducts research and development on new applied magnetic materials which can be used for commercial applications. Mossbauer spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resource spin echo spectroscopy and general magnetic testing media are used to study magnetic materials' microscopic structure and general magnetic behavior. The laboratory is equipped with major facilities including a vibrating sample magnetometer, high pressure mossbauer spectroscope and magnetron sputtering system, along with many others. The lab also serves as a key resource for research in materials science and condensed matter physics. The laboratory has 24 professional researchers and technicians, among who are 4 doctoral advisers. Analytical Testing Center Financed by the first loan issued by the World Bank to develop universities, construction on this center began in 1982. It contains more than 20 major instruments and devices including a High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer, Infrared Spectrometer, X-Ray Quadrupole Diffractometer, Laser Raman Spectrometer, FT-IR Spectrometer, and others. The center is primarily engaged in the determination and analysis of the structure of matter. It also conducts graduate students' experiments which leads to the conferring of Master's and Ph.D. degrees. A testing service is available to the public. Established by the State Technology Superintendency in 1992, it is the approved lab for the inspection of imported and exported chemical and mining products.

Generally, dram shop laws establish the liability of establishments arising out of the sale of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors who subsequently cause death or injury to third parties (those not having a relationship to the business that sold the alcohol) as a result of alcohol- related car crashes and other accidents. The laws are intended to protect the general public from the hazards of serving alcohol to minors and intoxicated patrons. Groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) have advocated for the enforcement and enactment of dram shop laws across the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The earliest dram shop laws date from the 19th century temperance movement. United States Serving alcohol to minors is illegal in all 50 states. Many states impose liability on bars for serving minors who subsequently injure themselves or others, to deter bars from serving alcohol to minors. Thus in states like Texas and New Jersey, minors can sue a drinking establishment for their own injuries sustained while intoxicated. In Texas, this also applies to a minor served alcohol at a residential property. In other states, dram shop liability only extends to serving the \\"habitually intoxicated.\\" The majority of states allow for recovery when the defendant knew (or should have known) the customer was intoxicated. Some states have attempted to address this problem through more exacting tests. Many states impose liability on social hosts as well as commercial establishments. This related area of the law is known as social host liability. Different states' dram shop acts also differ as to whether a person who becomes intoxicated and injures themselves has a cause of action against the establishment that served them. Some states, such as New Jersey, will allow such a cause of action but will instruct the jury to take the intoxicated person's own negligence into account. Other states, such as New York, will not allow a person who injures themselves to bring a lawsuit against the bar that served them, but if that person dies will allow such a person's children to sue the drinking establishment for loss of parental consortium. Illinois Under Illinois' dram shop law, plaintiffs can recover after demonstrating that: #alcohol was sold to the patron by the defendant; #damages were sustained by the plaintiff; #the sale of alcohol was the proximate cause of the intoxication; and #intoxication was at least one cause of the plaintiff's damages. Proximate cause includes the requirement that the dram shop must have been able to foresee that its actions could cause injuries to third parties, but this is true for any establishment that serves (sells) alcohol. One Illinois court allowed a lawsuit against a company that dropped off self-serve barrels of beer at a union picnic. Maryland In the state of Maryland there is no dram shop statute. Maryland only imposes social host liability on adults who knowingly and willfully provide alcohol to minors. Social host liability was recognized by the Maryland Court of Appeals on July 5, 2016, pursuant to ruling that adults should be responsible for the actions of the underage drinkers they host, because those under 21 aren‚Äôt competent to handle the potentially dangerous effects of alcohol. Massachusetts In Massachusetts, the state's highest court has held that a bar could be sued where a patron exhibiting \\"drunk, loud and vulgar\\" behavior was determined to be \\"visibly intoxicated\\". In that case, the evidence showed that the intoxicated patron had been served six or more White Russians by a bar. The patron left the bar, arriving at another bar about fifteen minutes later \\"totally drunk,\\" holding a White Russian. The next bar that he went to refused to serve him. Shortly thereafter, the intoxicated patron lost control of his car, drove on a sidewalk, and killed a pedestrian. Missouri Missouri's dram shop law requires proof that the party demonstrates \\"significantly uncoordinated physical action or significant physical dysfunction.\\" New York To recover damages under the New York state dram shop law, a plaintiff must prove the following: #the plaintiff suffered injury or damages as the result of the actions of an intoxicated individual, #the defendant served alcohol to the intoxicated person who caused the damages or injury, and #the defendant, therefore contributed to the further intoxication of the individual. Texas In Texas, a patron must be so obviously intoxicated that he presents a clear danger to himself and others. Dram shops are able to protect themselves from any claims of liability provided they are able to prove that they require all their employees to attend a TABC-approved ‚Äúseller training program‚Äù and that the employee accused of over-serving an intoxicated individual actually attended the program. If these criteria are met, then any plaintiff seeking to sue the dram shop must prove that the employer either directly or indirectly encouraged said employee to violate the Texas Dram Shop Act in order for there to be liability. This dram shop immunity is called \\"The Safe Harbor.\\" Effectiveness A 1993 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found some reduction in alcohol- related fatalities from the implementation of dram shop laws though it did not control for the special cases of Utah and Nevada, which may have distorted the results. A 2011 survey of eleven studies measuring dram shop acts against alcohol-related harms found strong evidence of the effectiveness of dram shop laws in reducing those harms.

She is one of six writers to win two Newbery Medals, the venerable American Library Association award for the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American children's literature.\\" Konigsburg submitted her first two manuscripts to editor Jean Karl at Atheneum Publishers in 1966, and both were published in 1967: Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth and From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. They made her the only person to be Newbery Medal winner and one of the runners-up in one year. She won again for The View from Saturday in 1997, 29 years later, the longest span between two Newberys awarded to one author. For her contribution as a children's writer Konigsburg was U.S. nominee in 2006 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children's books. Biography Elaine Lobl was born in New York City on February 10, 1930, but grew up in small Pennsylvania towns, the second of three daughters. She was born to two Jewish immigrants who moved from New York City to a mill town in Pennsylvania. She was an avid reader, although reading was only \\"tolerated\\" in her family, \\"not sanctioned like dusting furniture or baking cookies\\". She was high school valedictorian in Farrell, Pennsylvania, where there was no guidance counseling and she never heard of scholarships. To earn money for college, she worked as a bookkeeper at a meat plant, where she met David Konigsburg, the brother of one of the owners. Elaine entered Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and majored in chemistry, with her \\"artistic side ... essentially dormant\\", because she was good at it and the purpose of college was \\"to become a something‚Äîa librarian, a teacher, a chemist, a something\\". She became the first person in her family to earn a degree. After graduating, Elaine married David, who was then a graduate student in psychology. She started graduate school in chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh (1952 to 1954) but they moved to Jacksonville, Florida after he attained his doctorate. She worked as a science teacher at Bartram School for Girls until 1955; became the mother of three children, Paul, Laurie, and Ross (1955 to 1959); began painting at adult education after two children; and planned for the time they would all be in school. Konigsburg took the new direction after the family moved to Port Chester in Greater New York (1962), where she continued art lessons and joined the Art Students League. She began to write in the mornings when her third child started school. Her first published story Jennifer, Hecate was inspired by Laurie's experience as a new girl in Port Chester. Mixed-Up Files was inspired by her children's complaints about a picnic with many amenities of home; she inferred that if they ever ran away \\"[t]hey would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\" Konigsburg learned of those first two books' 1968 Newbery Award and honorable mention during her family's move back from Port Chester to Jacksonville. When she composed her autobiographical statement for The Book of Junior Authors (2000), she lived \\"on the beach in North Florida\\". The pieces of The View From Saturday (1996) had come together when she \\"left my desk and took a walk along the beach\\". As summarized by critic Marah Gubar, \\"For five decades, Konigsburg challenged readers by tackling subjects often avoided in children‚Äôs books, from the undercurrent of hostility that runs through an interracial friendship to the domestic unrest generated by the stirrings of pubescent and parental sexuality... Konigsburg was committed to depicting young people as capable knowers of what goes on in their own minds, homes, and the wider world they inhabit. Bad things happen in her novels when adult characters fail to respect this competence. At the same time, however, Konigsburg emphasizes that all knowledge is perspectival; the particular social position that each of us inhabits shapes what we know and how we come to know it.\\" Along with chapter books, some of which she has illustrated, Konigsburg is the writer and illustrator of three 1990s picture books \\"featuring her own grandchildren\\": Samuel Todd's Book of Great Colors, Samuel Todd's Book of Great Inventions, and Amy Elizabeth Explores Bloomingdale's.Mixed-Up Files, 35th anniversary ed., Afterword. Personal life In 1952, she married David Konigsburg, with whom she had three children, Paul (born 1955), Laurie (born 1956), and Ross (born 1959). As of 2002, she had five grandchildren, Samuel Todd and Amy Elizabeth being the eldest children of Laurie and Ross. Her husband, David Konigsburg, died in 2001. Konigsburg died in Falls Church, Virginia, on April 19, 2013, from complications of a stroke that she had suffered a week prior. Konigsburg was 83. Konigsburg was a longtime resident of Jacksonville and Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Themes Many of Konigsburg's stories feature childhood and adolescent struggles that are easy for school-age readers to understand. Often her characters are striving to find the answers to big questions that will help shape their identities. Many of them are based on her own experiences as a child, the observations she made of children while a teacher, and the experiences or observations of her children. Especially her characters are \\"softly comfortable on the outside and solidly uncomfortable on the inside\\". Teaching at Bartram, she learned that supposed \\"spoiled young women who had it all [actually] had all the creature comforts of the world, but ... were just as uncomfortable inside as I was when I was growing up.\\" Later she realized that her own children were middle-class suburban kids with comforts unlike her own. She has written about \\"their kind of growing up, something that addressed the problems that come about even though you don't have to worry if you wear out your shoes whether your parents can buy you a new pair, something that tackles the basic problems of who am I?\\" She has told Scholastic Teachers, \\"The essential problems remain the same. The kids I write about are asking for the same things I wanted. They want two contradictory things. They want to be the same as everyone else, and they want to be different from everyone else.They want acceptance for both.\\" Works Konigsburg is the author of the following books; those she illustrated are noted (\\"illus. ELK\\"). She said that Father's Arcane Daughter is sometimes her favorite book and Eleanor of Aquitaine is her character that she would most like to meet. Her work has been translated and published in multiple languages, including Korean. * Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth (1967), illus.

Also called site-specific mutagenesis or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, it is used for investigating the structure and biological activity of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules, and for protein engineering. Site-directed mutagenesis is one of the most important laboratory techniques for creating DNA libraries by introducing mutations into DNA sequences. There are numerous methods for achieving site-directed mutagenesis, but with decreasing costs of oligonucleotide synthesis, artificial gene synthesis is now occasionally used as an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis. Since 2013, the development of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, based on a prokaryotic viral defense system, has also allowed for the editing of the genome, and mutagenesis may be performed in vivo with relative ease. History Early attempts at mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagens were non-site- specific, generating random mutations. Analogs of nucleotides and other chemicals were later used to generate localized point mutations, examples of such chemicals are aminopurine, nitrosoguanidine, and bisulfite. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved in 1974 in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann using a nucleotide analogue N4-hydroxycytidine, which induces transition of GC to AT. These methods of mutagenesis, however, are limited by the kind of mutation they can achieve, and they are not as specific as later site-directed mutagenesis methods. In 1971, Clyde Hutchison and Marshall Edgell showed that it is possible to produce mutants with small fragments of phage œïX174 and restriction nucleases. Hutchison later produced with his collaborator Michael Smith in 1978 a more flexible approach to site-directed mutagenesis by using oligonucleotides in a primer extension method with DNA polymerase. For his part in the development of this process, Michael Smith later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in October 1993 with Kary B. Mullis, who invented polymerase chain reaction. Basic mechanism The basic procedure requires the synthesis of a short DNA primer. This synthetic primer contains the desired mutation and is complementary to the template DNA around the mutation site so it can hybridize with the DNA in the gene of interest. The mutation may be a single base change (a point mutation), multiple base changes, deletion, or insertion. The single-strand primer is then extended using a DNA polymerase, which copies the rest of the gene. The gene thus copied contains the mutated site, and is then introduced into a host cell in a vector and cloned. Finally, mutants are selected by DNA sequencing to check that they contain the desired mutation. Approaches The original method using single- primer extension was inefficient due to a low yield of mutants. This resulting mixture contains both the original unmutated template as well as the mutant strand, producing a mixed population of mutant and non-mutant progenies. Furthermore, the template used is methylated while the mutant strand is unmethylated, and the mutants may be counter-selected due to presence of mismatch repair system that favors the methylated template DNA, resulting in fewer mutants. Many approaches have since been developed to improve the efficiency of mutagenesis. A large number of methods are available to effect site-directed mutagenesis, although most of them have rarely been used in laboratories since the early 2000s, as newer techniques allow for simpler and easier ways of introducing site-specific mutation into genes.  Kunkel's method  In 1985, Thomas Kunkel introduced a technique that reduces the need to select for the mutants. The DNA fragment to be mutated is inserted into a phagemid such as M13mp18/19 and is then transformed into an E. coli strain deficient in two enzymes, dUTPase (dut) and uracil deglycosidase (udg). Both enzymes are part of a DNA repair pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant E. coli replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is extracted from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The heteroduplex DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP. The DNA is then transformed into an E. coli strain carrying the wildtype dut and udg genes. Here, the uracil- containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.  Cassette mutagenesis Unlike other methods, cassette mutagenesis need not involve primer extension using DNA polymerase. In this method, a fragment of DNA is synthesized, and then inserted into a plasmid. It involves the cleavage by a restriction enzyme at a site in the plasmid and subsequent ligation of a pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation in the gene of interest to the plasmid. Usually, the restriction enzymes that cut at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide are the same, permitting sticky ends of the plasmid and insert to ligate to one another. This method can generate mutants at close to 100% efficiency, but is limited by the availability of suitable restriction sites flanking the site that is to be mutated. PCR site-directed mutagenesis Depiction of one common way to clone a site-directed mutagenesis library (i.e., using degenerate oligos). The gene of interest is PCRed with oligos that contain a region that is perfectly complementary to the template (blue), and one that differs from the template by one or more nucleotides (red). Many such primers containing degeneracy in the non-complementary region are pooled into the same PCR, resulting in many different PCR products with different mutations in that region (individual mutants shown with different colors below). The limitation of restriction sites in cassette mutagenesis may be overcome using polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide \\"primers\\", such that a larger fragment may be generated, covering two convenient restriction sites. The exponential amplification in PCR produces a fragment containing the desired mutation in sufficient quantity to be separated from the original, unmutated plasmid by gel electrophoresis, which may then be inserted in the original context using standard recombinant molecular biology techniques. There are many variations of the same technique. The simplest method places the mutation site toward one of the ends of the fragment whereby one of two oligonucleotides used for generating the fragment contains the mutation. This involves a single step of PCR, but still has the inherent problem of requiring a suitable restriction site near the mutation site unless a very long primer is used. Other variations, therefore, employ three or four oligonucleotides, two of which may be non-mutagenic oligonucleotides that cover two convenient restriction sites and generate a fragment that can be digested and ligated into a plasmid, whereas the mutagenic oligonucleotide may be complementary to a location within that fragment well away from any convenient restriction site. These methods require multiple steps of PCR so that the final fragment to be ligated can contain the desired mutation. The design process for generating a fragment with the desired mutation and relevant restriction sites can be cumbersome. Software tools like SDM-Assist can simplify the process. Whole plasmid mutagenesis For plasmid manipulations, other site-directed mutagenesis techniques have been supplanted largely by techniques that are highly efficient but relatively simple, easy to use, and commercially available as a kit. An example of these techniques is the Quikchange method, wherein a pair of complementary mutagenic primers are used to amplify the entire plasmid in a thermocycling reaction using a high-fidelity non-strand- displacing DNA polymerase such as pfu polymerase. The reaction generates a nicked, circular DNA. The template DNA must be eliminated by enzymatic digestion with a restriction enzyme such as DpnI, which is specific for methylated DNA. All DNA produced from most Escherichia coli strains would be methylated; the template plasmid that is biosynthesized in E. coli will, therefore, be digested, while the mutated plasmid, which is generated in vitro and is therefore unmethylated, would be left undigested. Note that, in these double-strand plasmid mutagenesis methods, while the thermocycling reaction may be used, the DNA need not be exponentially amplified as in a PCR. Instead, the amplification is linear, and it is therefore inaccurate to describe them as a PCR, since there is no chain reaction. Note that pfu polymerase can become strand-displacing at higher extension temperature (‚â•70 ¬∞C) which can result in the failure of the experiment, therefore the extension reaction should be performed at the recommended temperature of 68 ¬∞C. In some applications, this method has been observed to lead to insertion of multiple copies of primers. A variation of this method, called SPRINP, prevents this artifact and has been used in different types of site directed mutagenesis. Other techniques such as scanning mutagenesis of oligo-directed targets (SMOOT) can semi-randomly combine mutagenic oligonucleotides in plasmid mutagenesis. This technique can create plasmid mutagenesis libraries ranging from single mutations to comprehensive codon mutagenesis across an entire gene.

The method does not require a transposon insertion site, leaves no marker, and its efficiency and simplicity has made it the preferred method for genome editing. Applications Site saturation mutagenesis is a type of site-directed mutagenesis. This image shows the saturation mutagenesis of a single position in a theoretical 10-residue protein. The wild type version of the protein is shown at the top, with M representing the first amino acid methionine, and * representing the termination of translation. All 19 mutants of the isoleucine at position 5 are shown below. Site-directed mutagenesis is used to generate mutations that may produce a rationally designed protein that has improved or special properties (i.e.protein engineering). Investigative tools ‚Äì specific mutations in DNA allow the function and properties of a DNA sequence or a protein to be investigated in a rational approach. Furthermore, single amino-acid changes by site-directed mutagenesis in proteins can help understand the importance of post- translational modifications. For instance changing a particular serine (phosphoacceptor) to an alanine (phospho-non-acceptor) in a substrate protein blocks the attachment of a phosphate group, thereby allows the phosphorylation to be investigated. This approach has been used to uncover the phosphorylation of the protein CBP by the kinase HIPK2 Another comprehensive approach is site saturation mutagenesis where one codon or a set of codons may be substituted with all possible amino acids at the specific positions. Commercial applications ‚Äì Proteins may be engineered to produce mutant forms that are tailored for a specific application. For example, commonly used laundry detergents may contain subtilisin, whose wild-type form has a methionine that can be oxidized by bleach, significantly reducing the activity the protein in the process. This methionine may be replaced by alanine or other residues, making it resistant to oxidation thereby keeping the protein active in the presence of bleach.  Gene synthesis  As the cost of DNA oligonucleotides synthesis falls, artificial synthesis of a complete gene is now a viable method for introducing mutation into gene. This method allows for extensive mutagenesis over multiples sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of gene to optimise it for a particular organism.

Plot summary The main characters of the book are Ashley Patterson, an introverted workaholic, her co-workers, Toni Prescott, an outgoing singer and dancer, shy artist Alette Peters and Ashley's father, Dr. Steven Patterson. The three women do not get along very well, because of their dissimilar natures. Toni and Alette generally maintain a friendship, with Alette a calming influence, but Toni dislikes Ashley and criticizes her harshly. All three have issues with their mothers having told them they'd never amount to anything. Ashley fears that somebody is following her. She finds her house lights turned on when she returns from work, her personal effects in disarray, and someone has written \\"You will die\\" on her mirror with a lipstick. She thinks someone's broken into her house. She requests a police escort, but the next morning, the police officer assigned to this duty is found dead in her apartment. Two other murders have already taken place, with an identical pattern. All the murdered men had been castrated and were having sex before being murdered. Evidence points to the same woman being involved in all three cases. When a gift from one of the murdered men to Toni is found among Ashley's things, she is identified as the killer and arrested. At this point, it is revealed that the three women are three selves of a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder. Ashley's father persuades an attorney friend, David Singer, to represent Ashley. The second half of the novel deals with the trial, complete with endless squabbling between opposing psychiatrists as to whether or not MPD is real. Finally when David introduces Toni, the violent alter of Ashley, the court is convinced that Ashley is innocent. Ashley is committed to an insane asylum and in the course of therapy is introduced to her two \\"alters\\" and relives the horrific events that shattered her mind. She was sexually abused during her childhood, and this made her develop a strong hatred towards men. In the asylum, Ashley is treated for MPD by Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Otto Lewis. Gilbert falls for her and during her crisis, he too feels her pain and wants to comfort her. It is revealed that her father, Dr. Steven, was the one who sexually abused her, causing her to develop Dissociative Identity Disorder resulting in the creation of the alter Toni, and becomes a thing of her mother's detest. While living in Italy during her teenage years, she was once again assaulted by her father, leading to the creation of Alette. The structuring of both the alters is very interesting. The first alter represents her struggle and fear as a helpless child without sexual maturity, and (Toni) develops into a protective one and becomes murderous when encountered with similar conditions.

The name Yeshu is also used in other sources before and after the completion of the Babylonian Talmud. It is also the modern Israeli spelling of Jesus. The identification of Jesus with any number of individuals named Yeshu has numerous problems, as most of the individuals are said to have lived in time periods far detached from that of Jesus; Yeshu the sorcerer is noted for being executed by the Hasmonean government which lost legal authority in 63 BC, Yeshu the student is described being among the Pharisees who returned to Israel from Egypt in 74 BC, and Yeshu ben Pandera/ben Stada's stepfather is noted as speaking with Rabbi Akiva shortly before the rabbi's execution, an event which occurred in c. 134 AD. During the Middle Ages, Ashkenazic Jewish authorities were forced to interpret these passages in relation to the Christian beliefs about Jesus of Nazareth. As historian David Berger observed, However, a probable answer is that rabbinic literature is often not literal but allegorical, thus stories can be made up to conjure a deeper meaning or a secret message that requires insider knowledge to fully understand. In 1240, Nicholas Donin, with the support of Pope Gregory IX, referred to Yeshu narratives to support his accusation that the Jewish community had attacked the virginity of Mary and the divinity of Jesus. In the Disputation of Paris, Yechiel of Paris conceded that one of the Yeshu stories in the Talmud referred to Jesus of Nazareth, but that the other passages referred to other people. In 1372, John of Valladolid, with the support of the Archbishop of Toledo, made a similar accusation against the Jewish community; Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas argued that the Yeshu narratives referred to different people and could not have referred to Jesus of Nazareth. Asher ben Jehiel also asserted that the Yeshu of the Talmud is unrelated to the Christian Jesus.Tosafot HaRosh (Sotah 47a) There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus,Robert E. Van Voorst. Jesus outside the New Testament. 2000 . p. 124. \\"This is likely an inference from the Talmud and other Jewish usage, where Jesus is called Yeshu, and other Jews with the same name are called by the fuller name Yehoshua, \\"Joshua\\"\\" and others who see references to Jesus only in later rabbinic literature. Johann Maier argued that neither the Mishnah nor the two Talmuds refer to Jesus.Johann Maier, Jesus von Nazareth in der talmudischen Uberlieferung (Ertrage der Forschung 82; Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1978) Etymology notes that the spelling Yeshu is found on one ossuary, Rahmani 9, which supports that the name Yeshu was not invented as a way of avoiding pronouncing the name Yeshua or Yehoshua in relation to Jesus, but that it may still be that rabbinical use of Yeshu was intended to distinguish Jesus from rabbis bearing the biblical name \\"Joshua,\\" Yehoshua. Foote and Wheeler considered that the name \\"Yeshu\\" was simply a shortened form of the name \\"Yehoshua\\" or Joshua. Another explanation given is that the name \\"Yeshu\\" is actually an acronym for the formula ('), meaning \\"may his name and memory be obliterated\\". The earliest known example of this theory comes from medieval Toledot Yeshu narratives. This has led to the accusation, first voiced by the anti-Judaist writer Johann Andreas Eisenmenger in his Entdecktes Judenthum, that \\"Yeshu\\" was always such a deliberately insulting term for Jesus. Eisenmenger claimed that Jews believed that they were forbidden to mention names of false gods and instead were commanded to change and defame them and did so with Jesus' name as they considered him a false god. He argued that Jesus' original name was \\"Yeshua\\" and as Jews did not recognize him as saviour (moshia\`) or that he had even saved (hoshia\`) himself, they left out the ayin from the root meaning \\"to save\\". Eisenmenger's book against Judaism was denounced by the Jews as malicious libel, and was the subject of a number of refutations. Early-20th- century writers such as and Klausner assume that references to Yeshu and Yeshu ha Notzri in the Talmud relate to Jesus. Indeed, in the Septuagint and Greek language Jewish texts such as the writings of Josephus and Philo of Alexandria, Jesus is the standard Greek translation of the common Hebrew name Yehoshua (Joshua), Greek having lost the h sound, as well as of the shortened form Yeshua which originated in the Second Temple period. Jesus was also used for the name Hoshea in the Septuagint in one of the three places where it referred to Joshua son of Nun.) The term \\"Yeshu\\" is not undisputedly attested prior to the Talmud and Tosefta, let alone as a Hebrew original for \\"Jesus\\". (In the case of the Jesus of Christianity, Clement of Alexandria and St. Cyril of Jerusalem claimed that the Greek form itself was his original name and that it was not a transliteration of a Hebrew form.)Origin of the Name Jesus Christ in The Catholic Encyclopedia Adolf Neubauer (19th century), aware of the problem but believing the term to be a reference to Jesus, argued that it was a shortened form of Yeshua resulting from the final letter ayin no longer being pronounced.A. Neubauer, Jewish Controversy and the Pugio Fidei, in The Expositor, no. 7, 1888, p. 24) Hugh J. Schonfield argued in a similar fashion that it was the northern pronunciation resulting from a silent ayin.Hugh J. Schonfield, The History of Jewish Christianity, From the First to the Twentieth Century London, Duckworth, 1936 This view was shared by Joachim JeremiasJ. Jeremias, Neutestamentliche Theologie, G√ºtersloh, 1973, vol. I, p. 13 and who argue that it was the Galilean pronunciation. The views of these theological scholars however are contradicted by the studies of Hebrew and Aramaic philologist E. Y. Kutscher, Professor of Hebrew Philology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and member of the Hebrew Language Academy, who noted that the although the ayin became a silent letter it is never dropped from written forms nor is its effect on the preceding vowel lost (the change of the \\"u\\" to the diphthong \\"ua\\") as would have had to occur if Yeshu were derived from Yeshua in such a manner. Kutscher noted moreover that the guttural ayin was still pronounced in most parts of Galilee.E.Y. Kutscher, Studies in Galilean Aramaic, Ramat-Gan, 1976 pp. ?? Talmud and Tosefta Isho or Eesho, the Aramaic name of Jesus The earliest undisputed occurrences of the term Yeshu are found in five anecdotes in the Tosefta (c 200 CE) and Babylonian Talmud (c 500 CE). The anecdotes appear in the Babylonian Talmud during the course of broader discussions on various religious or legal topics. The Venice edition of the Jerusalem Talmud contains the name Yeshu, but the Leiden manuscript has a name deleted, and \\"Yeshu\\" added in a marginal gloss. writes that due to this, Neusner treats the name as a gloss and omitted it from his translation of the Jerusalem Talmud. The Talmudic accounts in detail Yeshu ben Pandera In the Tosefta, Chullin 2:22-24 there are two anecdotes about the min (heretic) named Jacob naming his mentor Yeshu ben Pandera (Yeshu son of Pandera). *Chullin 2:22-23 tells how Rabbi Eleazar ben Damma was bitten by a snake. Jacob came to heal him (according to Lieberman's texthttp://talmud.faithweb.com/images/jnarr6.JPG) \\"on behalf of Yeshu ben Pandera\\". (A variant text of the Tosefta considered by Herford reads \\"Yeshua\\" instead of \\"Yeshu\\". This together with anomalous spellings of Pandera were found by Saul Lieberman who compared early manuscripts, to be erroneous attempts at correction by a copyist unfamiliar with the terms.) The account is also mentioned in corresponding passages of the Jerusalem Talmud (Avodah Zarah 2:2 IV.I) and Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 27b) The name Yeshu is not mentioned in the Hebrew manuscripts of these passages but reference to \\"Jeshu ben Pandira\\" is interpolated by Herford's in his English paraphrasing of the Jerusalem Talmud text. Similarly the Rodkinson translation of the Babylonian Talmud account interpolates \\"with the name of Jesus\\". *Chullin 2:24 tells how Rabbi Eliezer was once arrested and charged with minuth. When the chief judge (hegemon) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he \\"trusted the judge.\\" Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the judge interpreted him to be referring to the judge himself, and freed the Rabbi. The remainder of the account concerns why Rabbi Eliezer was arrested in the first place. Rabbi Akiva suggests that perhaps one of the minim had spoken a word of minuth to him and that it had pleased him. Rabbi Eliezer recalls that this was indeed the case, he had met Jacob of the town of Sakhnin in the streets of Sepphoris who spoke to him a word of minuth in the name of Yeshu ben Pandera, which had pleased him. (A variant reading used by Herford has Pantiri instead of Pandera.) *Avodah Zarah, 16b-17a in the Babylonian Talmud essentially repeats the account of Chullin 2:24 about Rabbi Eliezer and adds additional material. It tells that Jacob quoted Deuteronomy 23:19: \\"You shall not bring the fee of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God in fulfillment of any vow.\\" Jacob says that he was taught this by Yeshu. Jacob then asked Eliezer whether it was permissible to use a whore's money to build a retiring place for the High Priest? (Who spent the whole night preceding the Day of Atonement in the precincts of the Temple, where due provision had to be made for all his conveniences.) When Rabbi Eliezer did not reply, Jacob quoted Micah 1:7, \\"For they were amassed from whores' fees and they shall become whores' fees again.\\" This was the teaching that had pleased Rabbi Eliezer. The surname ben Pandera is not found in the Talmud account. (Rodkinson's translation drawing on the Tosefta account paraphrases the reference to Yeshu having taught Jacob by \\"so taught Jeshu b. Panthyra\\", in this case not translating \\"Yeshu\\" as \\"Jesus\\".) The name is found again in the Midrashic text Kohelet Rabba 10:5 where a healer of the grandson of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is described as being of ben Pandera. The source of this account is Shabbat 14:4-8 and Avodah Zarah 40 in the Jerusalem Talmud, but there ben Pandera is not mentioned. The word Yeshu is however found as a secondary marginal gloss to the first passage in the Leiden manuscript which together with the Midrashic version show that the account was understood to be about a follower of Yeshu ben Pandera. (Herford again takes liberty and adds \\"in the name of Jeshu Pandera\\" to his translation of the Talmud passages despite these words not being in the original text. Sch√§fer similarly provides a paraphrased translation mentioning \\"Jesus son of Pandera\\" which he admittedly has constructed himself by combining the Talmudic and Midrashic texts and the marginal glosses.) Kohelet Rabba also relates the account of Rabbi Eliezer (Kohelet Rabba 1:24) in this case some copies mention Yeshu ben Pandera as in the Tosefta passage but others instead read peloni a placeholder name equivalent to English \\"so-and-so\\". Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the accounts in Chullin and Avodah Zarah reveal an ambivalent relationship between rabbis and Christianity. In his view the tosefta account reveals that at least some Jews believed Christians were true healers, but that the rabbis saw this belief as a major threat. Concerning the Babylonian Talmud account in Avoda Zarah, Dr. Boyarin views Jacob of Sechania as a Christian preacher and understands Rabbi Eliezer's arrest for minuth as an arrest by the Romans for practising Christianity (the text uses the word for heretic). When the Governor (the text uses the word for chief judge) interrogated him, the rabbi answered that he \\"trusted the judge.\\" Boyarin has suggested that this was the Jewish version of the Br'er Rabbit approach to domination, which he contrasts to the strategy of many early Christians, who proclaim their beliefs in spite of the consequences (i.e. martyrdom). Although Rabbi Eliezer was referring to God, the Governor interpreted him to be referring to the Governor himself, and freed the rabbi. According to them the account also reveals that there was greater contact between Christians and Jews in the 2nd century than commonly believed. They view the account of the teaching of Yeshu as an attempt to mock Christianity. According to Dr. Rubenstein, the structure of this teaching, in which a biblical prooftext is used to answer a question about Biblical law, is common to both the rabbis and early Christians. The vulgar content, however, may have been used to parody Christian values. Dr. Boyarin considers the text to be an acknowledgment that rabbis often interacted with Christians, despite their doctrinal antipathy. A medieval account of Jesus, in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera (see translation of the 15th-century Yemenite manuscript: Toledot Yeshu), gives a contemporary view of Jesus and where he is portrayed as an impostor. =Meaning and etymology of Pandera= The meaning and etymology of this name are uncertain. Besides the form Pandera, variations have been found in different Tosefta manuscripts for example Pantiri and Pantera. Saul Lieberman's investigation of Tosefta variations revealed Pandera to be the original form. (Some authors such as Herford spell it Pandira in English.) Celsus in his discourse The True Word gives the name as Panthera in Greek. This name is not known from any graves or inscriptions, but the surname Pantera (a Latin rendering) is known from the 1st-century tombstone of Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera.Marcello Craveri, La vita di Ges√π, Feltrinelli, Milano, 1966 Origen (c. 248 CE) responded to Celsus' claim by saying that Pantheras was the patronymic of Joseph the husband of Mary on account of his father, Jacob, being called Panther. An alternative claim was made in the Teaching of Jacob (634 CE) where Panther is said to be the grandfather of Mary.Hugh Joseph Schonfield, According to the Hebrews, Duckworth, 1937 Friedrich August Nitzsch (1840) suggested that the name may refer to a panther being a lustful animal and thus have the meaning of \\"whore\\", additionally being a pun on parthenos meaning virgin. Herford also considered the Greek pentheros meaning father-in- law, however he dismissed all of these forms including Celsus' Panthera as spurious explanations of the Hebrew Pandera as they do not match phonetically. He noted that Hebrew would have represented the sounds correctly if any of these were the origin. The interpolated form Panthyra appearing in the Rodkinson translation of the Talmud suffers the same problem. Neubauer understand the name to be Pandareus.Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles and Chronological Notes, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1887-1895 The Toledot Yeshu narratives contain elements resembling the story of Pandareus in Greek mythology, namely stealing from a temple and the presence of a bronze animal. Robert Eisler Robert Eisler, Alexander Haggerty Krappe trans., The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist according to Flavius Josephus' recently rediscovered 'Capture of Jerusalem' and other Jewish and Christian sources. The Dial Press, 1931 considered the name to be derived from Pandaros. He also argued that it may not have been a real name but instead as a generic name for a betrayer. He notes that in the Iliad, Pandaros betrays the Greeks and breaks a truce confirmed by solemn oath. He argues that the name came to be used as a generic term for a betrayer and was borrowed by Hebrew. The name is indeed found in Genesis Rabba 50 in the expression qol Pandar (literally \\"voice of Pandaros\\" denoting false promises of a betrayer) used as a derogatory placeholder name for a judge of Sodom. The -a at the end of the form Pandera can be understood to be the Aramaic definite article. Yeshu Ha-Notzri In the surviving pre-censorship Talmud manuscripts, Yeshu is followed by the epithet Ha-Notzri in most occurrences. R. Travers Herford, Joseph Klausner and others translated it as \\"the Nazarene.\\" The term does not appear consistently in the manuscripts and Menachem Meiri (1249 ‚Äì c. 1310) in his commentary on the Talmud Beit HaBechirah regarded it as a late interpolation. Klausner noted objections by other scholars on grammatical and phonetic grounds to the translation of Notzri as \\"Nazarene\\" meaning a person from Nazareth (Hebrew Natzrat), however the etymology of \\"Nazarene\\" is itself uncertain and one possibility is that it is derived from Notzri and did not mean a person from Nazareth.William David Davies, Dale C. Allison, A critical and exegetical commentary on the gospel according to Saint Matthew, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997 In 1180 CE Maimonides in his Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Melachim 11:4 briefly discusses Jesus in a passage later censored by the Church. He uses the name Yeshua for Jesus (an attested equivalent of the name unlike Yeshu) and follows it with HaNotzri showing that regardless of what meaning had been intended in the Talmudic occurrences of this term, Maimonides understood it as an equivalent of Nazarene. Late additions to the Josippon also refer to Jesus as Yeshua HaNotzri but not Yeshu HaNotzri.David Flusser, The Josippon (Josephus Gorionides), The Bialik Institute, Jerusalem, 1978 Yeshu the sorcerer Sanhedrin 43a relates the trial and execution of Yeshu and his five disciples. Here, Yeshu is a sorcerer who has enticed other Jews to apostasy. A herald is sent to call for witnesses in his favour for forty days before his execution. No one comes forth and in the end he is stoned and hanged on the eve of Passover. His five disciples, named Matai, Nekai, Netzer, Buni, and Todah, are then tried. Word play is made on each of their names, and they are executed. It is mentioned that excessive leniency was applied because of Yeshu's influence with the royal government (malkhut). In the Florence manuscript of the Talmud (1177 CE) an addition is made to Sanhedrin 43a saying that Yeshu was hanged on the eve of the Sabbath. Yeshu summoned by Onkelos In Gittin 56b, 57a a story is mentioned in which Onkelos summons up the spirit of a Yeshu who sought to harm Israel. He describes his punishment in the afterlife as boiling in excrement. Yeshu the son who burns his food in public Sanhedrin 103a and Berachot 17b talk about a Yeshu who burns his food in public, possibly a reference to pagan sacrifices. The account is discussing Manasseh the king of Judah infamous for having turned to idolatry and having persecuted the Jews (2 Kings 21). It is part of a larger discussion about three kings and four commoners excluded from paradise. These are also discussed in the Shulkhan Arukh where the son who burns his food is explicitly stated to be Manasseh. Yeshu the student of Joshua ben Perachiah In Sanhedrin 107b and Sotah 47a a Yeshu is mentioned as a student of Joshua ben Perachiah who was sent away for misinterpreting a word that in context should have been understood as referring to the Inn, he instead understood it to mean the innkeeper's wife. His teacher said \\"Here is a nice Inn\\", to which he replied \\"Her eyes are crooked\\", to which his teacher responded \\"Is this what your are occupied in?\\" (This happened during their period of refuge in Egypt during the persecutions of Pharisees 88-76 BCE ordered by Alexander Jann√¶us. The incident is also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud in Chagigah 2:2 but there the person in question is not given any name.) After several returns for forgiveness he mistook Perachiah's signal to wait a moment as a signal of final rejection, and so he turned to idolatry (described by the euphemism \\"worshipping a brick\\"). The story ends by invoking a Mishnaic era teaching that Yeshu practised black magic, deceived and led Israel astray. This quote is seen by some as an explanation in general for the designation Yeshu. According to Dr. Rubenstein, the account in Sanhedrin 107b recognizes the kinship between Christians and Jews, since Jesus is presented as a disciple of a prominent rabbi. But it also reflects and speaks to an anxiety fundamental to Rabbinic Judaism. Prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70, Jews were divided into different sects, each promoting different interpretations of the law. Rabbinic Judaism domesticated and internalized conflicts over the law, while vigorously condemning any sectarianism. In other words, rabbis are encouraged to disagree and argue with one another, but these activities must be carefully contained, or else they could lead to a schism. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus' life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the rabbis. Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2:1-2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary rabbinic value. Ben Pandera and ben Stada Another title found in the Tosefta and Talmud is ben Stada (son of Stada). However, in Shabbat 104b and Sanhedrin 67a in the Babylonian Talmud, a passage is found that some have interpreted as equating ben Pandera with ben Stada. The passage is in the form of a Talmudic debate in which various voices make statements, each refuting the previous statement. In such debates the various statements and their refutations are often of a Midrashic nature, sometimes incorporating subtle humour and should not always be taken at face value. The purpose of the passage is to arrive at a Midrashic meaning for the term Stada. Shabbat 104b relates that a ben Stada brought magic from Egypt in incisions in his flesh. Sanhedrin 67a relates that a ben-Stada was caught by hidden observers and hanged in the town of Lod on the Eve of Passover. The debate then follows. It begins by asking if this was not ben Pandera rather than ben Stada. This is refuted by the claim that it is both, his mother's husband was Stada but her lover was Pandera. This is countered with the claim the husband was Pappos ben Yehuda (a 2nd-century figure elsewhere remembered as having locked up his unfaithful wife and visiting Rabbi Akiva in jail after the Bar-Kokhba revolt) and that the mother was named Stada. This is then refuted by the claim that the mother was named Miriam, the dresser of women's hair, but that she had gone astray from her husband (a Miriam the daughter of Bilgah, is mentioned elsewhere as having had an affair with a Roman soldier). In Aramaic, \\"gone astray\\" is satat da, thus a Midrashic meaning for the term Stada is obtained. Real historical relationships between the figures mentioned cannot be inferred due to the Midrashic nature of the debate. Pappos and Miriam might have been introduced simply as a result of their being remembered in connection with a theme of a woman having gone astray. Ben-Stada is also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud. In Shabbat 12:4 III he is mentioned as having learnt by cutting marks in his flesh. In Sanhedrin 7:12 I he is mentioned as an example of someone caught by hidden observers and subsequently stoned. This information is paralleled in the Tosefta in Shabbat 11:15 and Sanhedrin 10:11 respectively. Interpretation Tannaim and Amoraim The Tannaim and Amoraim who recorded the accounts in the Talmud and Tosefta use the term Yeshu as a designation in Sanhedrin 103a and Berakhot 17b in place of King Manasseh's real name. Sanhedrin 107b uses it for a Hasmonean era individual who in an earlier account (Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:2) is anonymous. In Gittin 56b, 57a it is used for one of three foreign enemies of Israel, the other two being from past and present with Yeshu representing a third not identified with any past or present event. Early Jewish commentators (Rishonim) These accounts of Celsus and the Toledot Yeshu do not form part of Orthodox Jewish interpretation. The only classical Jewish commentator to equate Yeshu with Jesus was the Rishon (early commentator) Abraham Ibn Daud who held the view that the Jesus of Christianity had been derived from the figure of Yeshu the student of ben Perachiah. Ibn Daud was nevertheless aware that such an equation contradicted known chronology but argued that the Gospel accounts were in error.G. Cohen, A critical Edition with a Translation and Notes of the Book of Tradition (Sefer haKabbalah) by Abraham Ibn Daud Other Rishonim, namely Rabbi Jacob ben Meir (Rabbeinu Tam), Nachmanides, and Yechiel of Paris explicitly repudiated the equation of the Yeshu of the Talmud and Jesus. Menachem Meiri observed that the epithet Ha- Notzri attached to Yeshu in many instances was a late gloss. The Church Friar Raymond Martini, in his anti-Jewish polemical treatise Pugio Fidei, began the accusation echoed in numerous subsequent anti-Jewish pamphlets that the Yeshu passages were derogatory accounts of Jesus. In 1554 a papal bull ordered the removal of all references from the Talmud and other Jewish texts deemed offensive and blasphemous to Christians. Thus the Yeshu passages were removed from subsequently published editions of the Talmud and Tosefta.Simon Cohen, Isaac Landman ed. The Universal Jewish encyclopedia: an authoritative and popular presentation of Jews and Judaism since the earliest times, The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia inc., 1941, article Censorship Nevertheless, several church writers would refer to the passages as evidence of Jesus outside the Gospels. Later Jewish commentators (Acharonim) Jehiel Heilprin held that Yeshu the student of Yehoshua ben Perachiah was not Jesus.Jehiel Heilprin, Seder ha-dorot, ed. Le·πøin-Epsh·π≠ein ·πøe-M. ·∏≤alinberg, 1867 Jacob Emden's writings also show an understanding that the Yeshu of the Talmud was not Jesus. Contemporary Orthodox scholars Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz translates \\"Yeshu\\" as \\"Jesus\\" in his translation of the Talmud.Steinsaltz, Adin. The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition. Random House, 1989 Elsewhere he has pointed out that Talmudic passages referring to Jesus had been deleted by the Christian censor.Steinsaltz The essential Talmud - Page 105 2006 \\"Wherever the Talmud makes derogatory reference to Jesus or to Christianity in general, the comment was completely erased, and the name of Christ was systematically removed, even when the reference was not negative.\\" Theosophists and esotericists The interpretation of Yeshu as a proto- Jesus first seen in Abraham ibn Daud's work would be revisited by Egyptologist Gerald Massey in his essay The historical Jesus and Mythical Christ,Gerald Massey, The Historical Jesus and Mythical Christ, Star Publishing Company, Springfield, Mass., 1886 and by G.R.S. Mead in his work Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?.G.R.S. Mead, Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?, Theosophical Publishing Society, London, 1903 The same view was reiterated by Rabbi Avraham Korman.Avraham Korman, Zeramim VeKitot Bayahdut, Tel Aviv, 1927 These views reflect the theosophical stance and criticism of tradition popular at the time but was rejected by later scholars. It has been revived in recent times by Alvar Elleg√•rd.Alvar Elleg√•rd Jesus ‚Äì One Hundred Years Before Christ: A Study In Creative Mythology, London, 1999 Critical scholarship Modern critical scholars debate whether Yeshu does or does not refer to the historical Jesus, a view seen in several 20th-century encyclopedia articles including The Jewish Encyclopedia, Joseph Dan in the Encyclopaedia Judaica (1972, 1997).Encyclopaedia Judaica CD-ROM Edition 1.0 1997, article Jesus and the Encyclopedia Hebraica (Israel). R. Travers based his work on the understanding that the term refers to Jesus, and it was also the understanding of Joseph Klausner. They agree that the accounts offer little independent or accurate historical evidence about Jesus. Herford argues that writers of the Talmud and Tosefta had only vague knowledge of Jesus and embellished the accounts to discredit him while disregarding chronology. Klausner distinguishes between core material in the accounts which he argues are not about Jesus and the references to \\"Yeshu\\" which he sees as additions spuriously associating the accounts with Jesus. Recent scholars in the same vein include Peter Sch√§fer, Recently, some scholars have argued that Yeshu is a literary device, and that the Yeshu stories provide a more complex view of early Rabbinic-Christian interactions. Whereas the Pharisees were one sect among several others in the Second Temple era, the Amoraim and Tannaim sought to establish Rabbinic Judaism as the normative form of Judaism. Like the rabbis, early Christians claimed to be working within Biblical traditions to provide new interpretations of Jewish laws and values. The sometimes blurry boundary between the rabbis and early Christians provided an important site for distinguishing between legitimate debate and heresy. Scholars like Jeffrey Rubenstein and Daniel Boyarin argue that it was through the Yeshu narratives that rabbis confronted this blurry boundary. According to Jeffrey Rubenstein, the account in Sanhedrin 107b recognizes the kinship between Christians and Jews, since Jesus is presented as a disciple of a prominent rabbi. But it also reflects and speaks to an anxiety fundamental to Rabbinic Judaism. Prior to the destruction of the Temple in 70, Jews were divided into different sects, each promoting different interpretations of the law. Rabbinic Judaism domesticated and internalized conflicts over the law, while vigorously condemning any sectarianism. In other words, rabbis are encouraged to disagree and argue with one another, but these activities must be carefully contained, or else they could lead to a schism. Although this story may not present a historically accurate account of Jesus' life, it does use a fiction about Jesus to communicate an important truth about the rabbis (see Jeffrey Rubenstein, Rabbinic Stories). Moreover, Rubenstein sees this story as a rebuke to overly harsh rabbis. Boyarin suggests that the rabbis were well aware of Christian views of the Pharisees and that this story acknowledges the Christian belief that Jesus was forgiving and the Pharisees were not (see Mark 2), while emphasizing forgiveness as a necessary rabbinic value.Jeffrey Rubenstein Rabbinic Stories (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002Daniel Boyarin, Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999 An intermediate view is that of Hyam Maccoby,Judaism on Trial (Littman Library of Jewish Civilisation) who argues that most of these stories were not originally about Jesus, but were incorporated into the Talmud in the belief that they were, as a response to Christian missionary activity. Skeptical writers Dennis McKinsey has challenged the view that the term refers to Jesus at all and argues that Jewish tradition knew of no historical Jesus.Dennis McKinsey, Biblical Errancy, A Reference Guide, Prometheus Books, (2000) Similar views have been expressed by skeptical science writer Frank R. Zindler in his polemical work The Jesus the Jews Never Knew: Sepher Toldoth Yeshu and the Quest of the Historical Jesus in Jewish Sources Frank R. Zindler, The Jesus the Jews Never Knew: Sepher Toldoth Yeshu and the Quest of the Historical Jesus in Jewish Sources, American Atheist Press, 2003 deliberately published outside the realm of Christian and Jewish scholarship. Points on which writers have differed Writers have thus differed on several distinct but closely related questions: *whether Yeshu was intended to mean Jesus or not (e.g. Herford vs Nahmanides) *whether the core material in the accounts regardless of the name was originally about Jesus or not (e.g. Herford vs Klausner) *whether the core material is derivative of Christian accounts of Jesus, a forerunner of such accounts or unrelated (e.g. Herford vs Ibn Daud vs McKinsey) *whether Yeshu is a real name or an acronym (e.g. Flusser vs Kjaer-Hansen) *whether Yeshu is a genuine Hebrew equivalent for the name Jesus, a pun on the name Jesus or unrelated to the name Jesus (e.g. Klausner vs Eisenmenger vs McKinsey) The Toledot Yeshu The Toledot Yeshu are not part of rabbinic literature and are considered neither canonical nor normative. There is no one authoritative Toledot Yeshu story; rather, various medieval versions existed that differ in attitudes towards the central characters and in story details. It is considered unlikely that any one person wrote it, and each version seems to be from a different set of storytellers. In these manuscripts, the name \\"Yeshu\\" is used as designation of the central character. The stories typically understand the name \\"Yeshu\\" to be the acronym ', but justify its usage by claiming that it is wordplay on his real name, Yehoshua (i.e. Joshua, a Hebrew equivalent of \\"Jesus\\"). The story is set in the Hasmonean era, reflecting the setting of the account of Yeshu the student of Yehoshuah ben Perachiah in the Talmud. Due to the Gospel parallels, the Toledot Yeshu narratives are typically viewed as a derogatory account of the life of Jesus resulting from Jewish reaction to persecution by Christians.Morris Goldstein, Jesus in the Jewish Tradition, Macmillan, 1950 Other occurrences The name Yeshu has also been found on the 1st-century CE ossuary of a Yeshua bar Yehoseph, published by E.L. Sukenik in 1931, and catalogued by L.Y. Rahmani in 1994. Although Sukenik considered this the same as the term in the Talmud, he also entertained the possibility that the final letter ayin was left out due to lack of space between the decorations between which it was inscribed. The fully spelled out name Yeshua and the patronymic are also found on the ossuary. Ada Yardeni Textbook of Aramaic, Hebrew and Nabataean documentary texts 2000 \\"(Rahmani 9) Yeshua son of Yehosef\\"Brother of Jesus p59 Hershel Shanks, Ben Witherington - 2004 -\\"One of these, published by Professor E. L. Sukenik of the Hebrew University in 1931 (but purchased by the Palestine Archaeological Museum in 1926), is twice inscribed ‚Äî once simply Yeshu (Jesus) and then Yeshua bar Yehosef,\\" ªAtiqot: 29-30 Israel. Rashut ha-  ªati·∏≥ot - 1996 \\"The name yeshua (Yeshua = Jesus), a derivative of Yehoshua (Joshua), has been found on five ossuaries in the Israel State Collections, yeshu (Yeshu) on one, yehoshua (Yehoshua) on one,..(Rahmani 1994:293-295).\\" Richard Bauckham considers this a legitimate, if rare, form of the name in use at the time, and writes that this ossuary shows that the name Yeshu \\"was not invented by the rabbis as a way of avoiding pronouncing the real name of Jesus of Nazareth‚Ä¶.\\" The name Yeshu has also been found in a fragment of the Jerusalem Talmud from the Cairo Genizah, a depository for holy texts which are not usable due to age, damage or errors. Flusser takes this as evidence of the term being a name; however, the standard text of the Jerusalem Talmud refers to one of the numerous Rabbi Yehoshuas of the Talmud and moreover the fragment has the latter name at other points in the text.L. Ginzberg ed., Yerushalmi Fragments from the Genizah, New York, 1909 Yeshu is also mentioned in Isaac Luria's \\"Book of the Reincarnations\\", chapter 37. Within the long list of Jewish Tzadiks it is written: :◊ë◊ú◊õ◊™◊ö ◊û◊¶◊§◊™ ◊ú◊¶◊ì ◊¶◊§◊ï◊ü ◊ú◊ú◊õ◊™ ◊ê◊ú ◊õ◊§◊® ◊¢◊ô◊ü ◊ñ◊ô◊™◊ï◊ü, ◊ì◊®◊ö ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊ü ◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊©◊ú ◊ó◊®◊ï◊ë, ◊©◊ù ◊ß◊ë◊ï◊® ◊ô◊©\\"◊ï ◊î◊†◊ï◊¶◊®◊ô :On your way from Safed toward the North to the village of Ein al-Zeitun, passing a carob tree, Yeshu Ha-Notzri is buried there. A similar legend was reported by a Spanish monk when he visited Safed in 1555, with the difference in that the place was not where he was buried but where he hid.http://www.zadikim.com/?catID=70766 Use in modern Hebrew as a name for Jesus The term Yeshu was used in Hebrew texts in the Middle Ages then through Rahabi Ezekiel (1750) and Elias Soloweyczyk (1869) who identified Jesus with the character of the Toledoth Yeshu narratives. Likewise Yeshu Ha-Notzri is the modern Hebrew equivalent for \\"Jesus the Nazarene\\" though in Christian texts the spellings Yeshua (i.e. \\"Joshua\\") and Yeshua Ha-Notzri are preferred, as per the Hebrew New Testaments of Franz Delitzsch (BFBS 1875) and Isaac Salkinsohn (TBS 1886). In Israeli Hebrew Yeshu is used for Jesus of Nazareth per Aaron Abraham Kabak's novel \\"On the narrow path\\" Ba-Mishcol Ha-Tsar (1937). As with Bauckham's observation of medieval sources, the name Yeshu is still never applied to any of the other Joshuas in modern Hebrew, and lexicographers such as Reuben Alcalay distinguish Yeshua - \\"Joshua,\\" and Yeshu - \\"Jesus.\\" See also * Jacob the Min * Jesus in the Talmud * Yeshua References Further reading * Steven Bayme, Understanding Jewish History (KTAV), 1997 * Daniel Boyarin, Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999 * Robert Goldenberg, The Nations Know Ye Not: Ancient Jewish Attitudes towards Other Religions New York: New York University Press 1998 * Mark Hirshman, A Rivalry of Genius: Jewish and Christian Biblical Interpretation in Late Antiquity trans.

The vector is used to introduce a specific gene into a target cell, and can commandeer the cell's mechanism for protein synthesis to produce the protein encoded by the gene. Expression vectors are the basic tools in biotechnology for the production of proteins. The vector is engineered to contain regulatory sequences that act as enhancer and promoter regions and lead to efficient transcription of the gene carried on the expression vector.sci.sdsu.edu The goal of a well-designed expression vector is the efficient production of protein, and this may be achieved by the production of significant amount of stable messenger RNA, which can then be translated into protein. The expression of a protein may be tightly controlled, and the protein is only produced in significant quantity when necessary through the use of an inducer, in some systems however the protein may be expressed constitutively. Escherichia coli is commonly used as the host for protein production, but other cell types may also be used. An example of the use of expression vector is the production of insulin, which is used for medical treatments of diabetes. Elements An expression vector has features that any vector may have, such as an origin of replication, a selectable marker, and a suitable site for the insertion of a gene like the multiple cloning site. The cloned gene may be transferred from a specialized cloning vector to an expression vector, although it is possible to clone directly into an expression vector. The cloning process is normally performed in Escherichia coli. Vectors used for protein production in organisms other than E.coli may have, in addition to a suitable origin of replication for its propagation in E. coli, elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism, and these vectors are called shuttle vectors. Elements for expression An expression vector must have elements necessary for gene expression. These may include a promoter, the correct translation initiation sequence such as a ribosomal binding site and start codon, a termination codon, and a transcription termination sequence. There are differences in the machinery for protein synthesis between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, therefore the expression vectors must have the elements for expression that are appropriate for the chosen host. For example, prokaryotes expression vectors would have a Shine-Dalgarno sequence at its translation initiation site for the binding of ribosomes, while eukaryotes expression vectors would contain the Kozak consensus sequence. The promoter initiates the transcription and is therefore the point of control for the expression of the cloned gene. The promoters used in expression vector are normally inducible, meaning that protein synthesis is only initiated when required by the introduction of an inducer such as IPTG. Gene expression however may also be constitutive (i.e. protein is constantly expressed) in some expression vectors. Low level of constitutive protein synthesis may occur even in expression vectors with tightly controlled promoters. Protein tags After the expression of the gene product, it may be necessary to purify the expressed protein; however, separating the protein of interest from the great majority of proteins of the host cell can be a protracted process. To make this purification process easier, a purification tag may be added to the cloned gene. This tag could be histidine (His) tag, other marker peptides, or a fusion partners such as glutathione S-transferase or maltose-binding protein. Some of these fusion partners may also help to increase the solubility of some expressed proteins. Other fusion proteins such as green fluorescent protein may act as a reporter gene for the identification of successful cloned genes, or they may be used to study protein expression in cellular imaging. Others The expression vector is transformed or transfected into the host cell for protein synthesis. Some expression vectors may have elements for transformation or the insertion of DNA into the host chromosome, for example the vir genes for plant transformation, and integrase sites for chromosomal integration . Some vectors may include targeting sequence that may target the expressed protein to a specific location such as the periplasmic space of bacteria. Expression/Production systems Different organisms may be used to express a gene's target protein, and the expression vector used will therefore have elements specific for use in the particular organism. The most commonly used organism for protein production is the bacterium Escherichia coli. However, not all proteins can be successfully expressed in E. coli, or be expressed with the correct form of post-translational modifications such as glycosylations, and other systems may therefore be used. Bacterial An example of a bacterial expression vector is the pGEX-3x plasmid The expression host of choice for the expression of many proteins is Escherichia coli as the production of heterologous protein in E. coli is relatively simple and convenient, as well as being rapid and cheap. A large number of E. coli expression plasmids are also available for a wide variety of needs. Other bacteria used for protein production include Bacillus subtilis. Most heterologous proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli. However, not all proteins formed may be soluble in the cytoplasm, and incorrectly folded proteins formed in cytoplasm can form insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies. Such insoluble proteins will require refolding, which can be an involved process and may not necessarily produce high yield. Proteins which have disulphide bonds are often not able to fold correctly due to the reducing environment in the cytoplasm which prevents such bond formation, and a possible solution is to target the protein to the periplasmic space by the use of an N-terminal signal sequence. Another possibility is to manipulate the redox environment of the cytoplasm. Other more sophisticated systems are also being developed; such systems may allow for the expression of proteins previously thought impossible in E. coli, such as glycosylated proteins. The promoters used for these vector are usually based on the promoter of the lac operon or the T7 promoter, and they are normally regulated by the lac operator. These promoters may also be hybrids of different promoters, for example, the Tac-Promoter is a hybrid of trp and lac promoters. Note that most commonly used lac or lac-derived promoters are based on the lacUV5 mutant which is insensitive to catabolite repression. This mutant allows for expression of protein under the control of the lac promoter when the growth medium contains glucose since glucose would inhibit gene expression if wild- type lac promoter is used. Presence of glucose nevertheless may still be used to reduce background expression through residual inhibition in some systems. Examples of E. coli expression vectors are the pGEX series of vectors where glutathione S-transferase is used as a fusion partner and gene expression is under the control of the tac promoter, and the pET series of vectors which uses a T7 promoter. It is possible to simultaneously express two or more different proteins in E. coli using different plasmids. However, when 2 or more plasmids are used, each plasmid needs to use a different antibiotic selection as well as a different origin of replication, otherwise one of the plasmids may not be stably maintained. Many commonly used plasmids are based on the ColE1 replicon and are therefore incompatible with each other; in order for a ColE1-based plasmid to coexist with another in the same cell, the other would need to be of a different replicon, e.g. a p15A replicon-based plasmid such as the pACYC series of plasmids. Another approach would be to use a single two-cistron vector or design the coding sequences in tandem as a bi- or poly-cistronic construct. Yeast A yeast commonly used for protein production is Pichia pastoris. Examples of yeast expression vector in Pichia are the pPIC series of vectors, and these vectors use the AOX1 promoter which is inducible with methanol. The plasmids may contain elements for insertion of foreign DNA into the yeast genome and signal sequence for the secretion of expressed protein. Proteins with disulphide bonds and glycosylation can be efficiently produced in yeast. Another yeast used for protein production is Kluyveromyces lactis and the gene is expressed, driven by a variant of the strong lactase LAC4 promoter. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is particularly widely used for gene expression studies in yeast, for example in yeast two-hybrid system for the study of protein-protein interaction. The vectors used in yeast two-hybrid system contain fusion partners for two cloned genes that allow the transcription of a reporter gene when there is interaction between the two proteins expressed from the cloned genes. Baculovirus Baculovirus, a rod-shaped virus which infects insect cells, is used as the expression vector in this system. Insect cell lines derived from Lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), such as Spodoptera frugiperda, are used as host. A cell line derived from the cabbage looper is of particular interest, as it has been developed to grow fast and without the expensive serum normally needed to boost cell growth. The shuttle vector is called bacmid, and gene expression is under the control of a strong promoter pPolh. Baculovirus has also been used with mammalian cell lines in the BacMam system. Baculovirus is normally used for production of glycoproteins, although the glycosylations may be different from those found in vertebrates. In general, it is safer to use than mammalian virus as it has a limited host range and does not infect vertebrates without modifications. Plant Many plant expression vectors are based on the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In these expression vectors, DNA to be inserted into plant is cloned into the T-DNA, a stretch of DNA flanked by a 25-bp direct repeat sequence at either end, and which can integrate into the plant genome. The T-DNA also contains the selectable marker. The Agrobacterium provides a mechanism for transformation, integration of into the plant genome, and the promoters for its vir genes may also be used for the cloned genes. Concerns over the transfer of bacterial or viral genetic material into the plant however have led to the development of vectors called intragenic vectors whereby functional equivalents of plant genome are used so that there is no transfer of genetic material from an alien species into the plant. Plant viruses may be used as vectors since the Agrobacterium method does not work for all plants. Examples of plant virus used are the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), potato virus X, and cowpea mosaic virus. The protein may be expressed as a fusion to the coat protein of the virus and is displayed on the surface of assembled viral particles, or as an unfused protein that accumulates within the plant. Expression in plant using plant vectors is often constitutive, and a commonly used constitutive promoter in plant expression vectors is the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Mammalian Mammalian expression vectors offer considerable advantages for the expression of mammalian proteins over bacterial expression systems - proper folding, post- translational modifications, and relevant enzymatic activity. It may also be more desirable than other eukaryotic non-mammalian systems whereby the proteins expressed may not contain the correct glycosylations. It is of particular use in producing membrane-associating proteins that require chaperones for proper folding and stability as well as containing numerous post-translational modifications. The downside, however, is the low yield of product in comparison to prokaryotic vectors as well as the costly nature of the techniques involved. Its complicated technology, and potential contamination with animal viruses of mammalian cell expression have also placed a constraint on its use in large-scale industrial production. Cultured mammalian cell lines such as the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), COS, including human cell lines such as HEK and HeLa may be used to produce protein. Vectors are transfected into the cells and the DNA may be integrated into the genome by homologous recombination in the case of stable transfection, or the cells may be transiently transfected. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include the adenoviral vectors, the pSV and the pCMV series of plasmid vectors, vaccinia and retroviral vectors, as well as baculovirus. The promoters for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and SV40 are commonly used in mammalian expression vectors to drive gene expression. Non-viral promoter, such as the elongation factor (EF)-1 promoter, is also known. Cell-free systems E. coli cell lysate containing the cellular components required for transcription and translation are used in this in vitro method of protein production. The advantage of such system is that protein may be produced much faster than those produced in vivo since it does not require time to culture the cells, but it is also more expensive. Vectors used for E. coli expression can be used in this system although specifically designed vectors for this system are also available. Eukaryotic cell extracts may also be used in other cell-free systems, for example, the wheat germ cell-free expression systems. Mammalian cell-free systems have also been produced. Applications Laboratory use Expression vector in an expression host is now the usual method used in laboratories to produce proteins for research. Most proteins are produced in E. coli, but for glycosylated proteins and those with disulphide bonds, yeast, baculovirus and mammalian systems may be used. Production of peptide and protein pharmaceuticals Most protein pharmaceuticals are now produced through recombinant DNA technology using expression vectors. These peptide and protein pharmaceuticals may be hormones, vaccines, antibiotics, antibodies, and enzymes. The first human recombinant protein used for disease management, insulin, was introduced in 1982. Biotechnology allows these peptide and protein pharmaceuticals, some of which were previously rare or difficult to obtain, to be produced in large quantity. It also reduces the risks of contaminants such as host viruses, toxins and prions. Examples from the past include prion contamination in growth hormone extracted from pituitary glands harvested from human cadavers, which caused Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease in patients receiving treatment for dwarfism, and viral contaminants in clotting factor VIII isolated from human blood that resulted in the transmission of viral diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS. Such risk is reduced or removed completely when the proteins are produced in non-human host cells. Transgenic plant and animals In recent years, expression vectors have been used to introduce specific genes into plants and animals to produce transgenic organisms, for example in agriculture it is used to produce transgenic plants. Expression vectors have been used to introduce a vitamin A precursor, beta-carotene, into rice plants. This product is called golden rice. This process has also been used to introduce a gene into plants that produces an insecticide, called Bacillus thuringiensis toxin or Bt toxin which reduces the need for farmers to apply insecticides since it is produced by the modified organism. In addition expression vectors are used to extend the ripeness of tomatoes by altering the plant so that it produces less of the chemical that causes the tomatoes to rot. There have been controversies over using expression vectors to modify crops due to the fact that there might be unknown health risks, possibilities of companies patenting certain genetically modified food crops, and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, this technique is still being used and heavily researched. Transgenic animals have also been produced to study animal biochemical processes and human diseases, or used to produce pharmaceuticals and other proteins. They may also be engineered to have advantageous or useful traits. Green fluorescent protein is sometimes used as tags which results in animal that can fluoresce, and this have been exploited commercially to produce the fluorescent GloFish. Gene therapy Gene therapy is a promising treatment for a number of diseases where a \\"normal\\" gene carried by the vector is inserted into the genome, to replace an \\"abnormal\\" gene or supplement the expression of particular gene. Viral vectors are generally used but other nonviral methods of delivery are being developed. The treatment is still a risky option due to the viral vector used which can cause ill-effects, for example giving rise to insertional mutation that can result in cancer. However, there have been promising results.

In its most basic, globally recognized form, the periphery of the dial is numbered 1 through 12 indicating the hours in a 12-hour cycle, and a short hour hand makes two revolutions in a day. A long minute hand makes one revolution every hour. The face may also include a second hand, which makes one revolution per minute. The term is less commonly used for the time display on digital clocks and watches. A second type of clock face is the 24-hour analog dial, widely used in military and other organizations that use 24-hour time. This is similar to the 12-hour dial above, except it has hours numbered 1‚Äì24 around the outside, and the hour hand makes only one revolution per day. Some special-purpose clocks, such as timers and sporting event clocks, are designed for measuring periods less than one hour. Clocks can indicate the hour with Roman numerals or Hindu‚ÄìArabic numerals, or with non-numeric indicator marks. The two numbering systems have also been used in combination, with the prior indicating the hour and the latter the minute. Longcase clocks (grandfather clocks) typically use Roman numerals for the hours. Clocks using only Arabic numerals first began to appear in the mid-18th century. The clock face is so familiar that the numbers are often omitted and replaced with unlabeled graduations (marks), particularly in the case of watches. Occasionally, markings of any sort are dispensed with, and the time is read by the angles of the hands. Reading a modern clock face '12:14' in both analog and digital representations. In the analog clock, the minute hand is on \\"14\\" minutes, and the hour hand is moving from \\"12\\" to \\"1\\" - this indicates a time of 12:14. A ship's radio room wall clock during the age of wireless telegraphy showing '10:09' and 36 seconds'. The green and red shaded areas denote 3 minute periods during which radio silence was maintained to facilitate listening for distress calls at 2182 kHz and 500 kHz respectively. Most modern clocks have the numbers 1 through 12 printed at equally spaced intervals around the periphery of the face with the 12 at the top, indicating the hour, and on many models, sixty dots or lines evenly spaced in a ring around the outside of the dial, indicating minutes and seconds. The time is read by observing the placement of several \\"hands\\", which emanate from the centre of the dial: *A short, thick \\"hour\\" hand; *A long, thinner \\"minute\\" hand; *On some models, a very thin \\"second\\" or \\"sweep\\" hand All the hands continuously rotate around the dial in a clockwise direction ‚Äì in the direction of increasing numbers. *The second, or sweep, hand moves relatively quickly, taking a full minute (sixty seconds) to make a complete rotation from 12 to 12. For every rotation of the second hand, the minute hand will move from one minute mark to the next. *The minute hand rotates more slowly around the dial. It takes one hour (sixty minutes) to make a complete rotation from 12 to 12. For every rotation of the minute hand, the hour hand will move from one hour mark to the next. *The hour hand moves slowest of all, taking twelve hours (half a day) to make a complete rotation. It starts from \\"12\\" at midnight, makes one rotation until it is pointing at \\"12\\" again at noon, and then makes another rotation until it is pointing at \\"12\\" again at midnight of the next morning. Historical development 15th-century rotating dial clock face, St. Mary's Church, Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. The word clock derives from the medieval Latin word for \\"bell\\"; clogga, and has cognates in many European languages. Clocks spread to England from the Low Countries, so the English word came from the Middle Low German and Middle Dutch Klocke. The first mechanical clocks, built in 13th-century Europe, were striking clocks: their purpose was to ring bells upon the canonical hours, to call the local community to prayer. These were tower clocks installed in bell towers in public places, to ensure that the bells were audible over a wide area. Soon after these first mechanical clocks were in place people realized that their wheels could be used to drive an indicator on a dial on the outside of the tower, where it could be widely seen. Before the late 14th century, a fixed hand (often a carving literally shaped like a hand) indicated the hour by pointing to numbers on a rotating dial; after this time, the current convention of a rotating hand on a fixed dial was adopted. Minute hands (so named because they indicated the small, or minute, divisions of the hour) only came into regular use around 1690, after the invention of the pendulum and anchor escapement increased the precision of time-telling enough to justify it. In some precision clocks, a third hand, which rotated once a minute, was added in a separate subdial. This was called the \\"second-minute\\" hand (because it measured the secondary minute divisions of the hour), which was shortened to \\"second\\" hand. The convention of the hands moving clockwise evolved in imitation of the sundial. In the Northern hemisphere, where the clock face originated, the shadow of the gnomon on a horizontal sundial moves clockwise during the day. French decimal time French decimal clock (with the 24 standard hours included around the outside) During the French Revolution in 1793, in connection with its Republican calendar, France attempted to introduce a decimal time system. This had 10 decimal hours in the day, 100 decimal minutes per hour, and 100 decimal seconds per minute. Therefore, the decimal hour was more than twice as long (144 min) as the present hour, the decimal minute was slightly longer than the present minute (86 seconds) and the decimal second was slightly shorter (0.86 sec) than the present second. Clocks were manufactured with this alternate face, usually combined with traditional hour markings. However, it did not catch on, and France discontinued the mandatory use of decimal time on 7 April 1795, although some French cities used decimal time until 1801. Stylistic development A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face A simple 24 hour clock showing the approximate position of the sun. Until the last quarter of the 17th century, hour markings were etched into metal faces and the recesses filled with black wax. Subsequently, higher contrast and improved readability was achieved with white enamel plaques painted with black numbers. Initially, the numbers were printed on small, individual plaques mounted on a brass substructure. This was not a stylistic decision, rather enamel production technology had not yet achieved the ability to create large pieces of enamel. The \\"13-piece face\\" was an early attempt to create an entirely white enamel face. As the name suggests, it was composed of 13 enamel plaques: 12 numbered wedges fitted around a circle. The first single-piece enamel faces, not unlike those in production today, began to appear . It is customary for modern advertisements to display clocks and watches set to approximately 10:10 or 1:50, as this V-shaped arrangement roughly makes a smile, imitates a human figure with raised arms, and leaves the watch company's logo unobscured by the hands. In the 1970s, German designer Tian Harlan invented the Chromachron, a wristwatch with a clock face that has no dials but a disc with pie-shaped pattern rotating by the minute over color patterns representing both hours and minutes. Removal of analog clocks In 2018, some United Kingdom schools were replacing analogue clocks in examination halls with digital ones because an increasing number of pupils were unable to read traditional (non-digital) clocks.

In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time. Named by Mih√°ly Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi in 1975, the concept has been widely referred to across a variety of fields (and is particularly well recognized in occupational therapy), though the concept has been claimed to have existed for thousands of years under other names. The flow state shares many characteristics with hyperfocus. However, hyperfocus is not always described in a positive light. Some examples include spending \\"too much\\" time playing video games or watching television and getting side-tracked and pleasurably absorbed by one aspect of an assignment or task to the detriment of the overall assignment. In some cases, hyperfocus can \\"capture\\" a person, perhaps causing them to appear unfocused or to start several projects, but complete few. Other related concepts include trance, hypnosis, hypomania and mindfulness. Components Jeanne Nakamura and Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow: * Intense and focused concentration on the present moment * Merging of action and awareness * A loss of reflective self-consciousness * A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity * A distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered * Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called flow experience. Additionally, psychology writer Kendra Cherry has mentioned three other components that Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi lists as being a part of the flow experience: * Immediate feedback * Feeling the potential to succeed * Feeling so engrossed in the experience, that other needs become negligible Just as with the conditions listed above, these conditions can be independent of one another. Etymology Flow is so named because during Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi's 1975 interviews several people described their \\"flow\\" experiences using the metaphor of a water current carrying them along. History Mihaly Csikszentmih√°lyi and others began researching flow after Csikszentmih√°lyi became fascinated by artists who would essentially get lost in their work. Artists, especially painters, got so immersed in their work that they would disregard their need for food, water and even sleep. The theory of flow came about when Csikszentmih√°lyi tried to understand the phenomenon experienced by these artists. Flow research became prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s, with Csikszentmih√°lyi and his colleagues in Italy still at the forefront. Researchers interested in optimal experiences and emphasizing positive experiences, especially in places such as schools and the business world, also began studying the theory of flow at this time. The cognitive science of flow has been studied under the rubric of effortless attention. Mechanism In any given moment, there is a great deal of information made available to each individual. Psychologists have found that one's mind can attend to only a certain amount of information at a time. According to Csikszentmih√°lyi's 2004 TED talk, that number is about \\"110 bits of information per second\\". That may seem like a lot of information, but simple daily tasks take quite a lot of information. Just decoding speech takes about 60 bits of information per second. That is why when having a conversation one cannot focus as much attention on other things. For the most part (except for basic bodily feelings like hunger and pain, which are innate), people are able to decide what they want to focus their attention on. However, when one is in the flow state, they are completely engrossed with the one task at hand and, without making the conscious decision to do so, lose awareness of all other things: time, people, distractions, and even basic bodily needs. According to Csikszentmih√°lyi, this occurs because all of the attention of the person in the flow state is on the task at hand; there is no more attention to be allocated. The flow state has been described by Csikszentmih√°lyi as the \\"optimal experience\\" in that one gets to a level of high gratification from the experience. Achieving this experience is considered to be personal and \\"depends on the ability\\" of the individual. One's capacity and desire to overcome challenges in order to achieve their ultimate goals not only leads to the optimal experience, but also to a sense of life satisfaction overall. Measurement There are three common ways to measure flow experiences: the flow questionnaire (FQ), the experience sampling method (ESM), and the \\"standardized scales of the componential approach.\\" Flow questionnaire The FQ requires individuals to identify definitions of flow and situations in which they believe that they have experienced flow, followed by a section that asks them to evaluate their personal experiences in these flow-inducing situations. The FQ identifies flow as multiple constructs, therefore allowing the results to be used to estimate differences in the likelihood of experiencing flow across a variety of factors. Another strength of the FQ is that it does not assume that everyone's flow experiences are the same. Because of this, the FQ is the ideal measure for estimating the prevalence of flow. However, the FQ has some weaknesses that more recent methods have set out to address. The FQ does not allow for measurement of the intensity of flow during specific activities. This method also does not measure the influence of the ratio of challenge to skill on the flow state. Experience sampling method The ESM requires individuals to fill out the experience sampling form (ESF) at eight randomly chosen time intervals throughout the day. The purpose of this is to understand subjective experiences by estimating the time intervals that individuals spend in specific states during everyday life. The ESF is made up of 13 categorical items and 29 scaled items. The purpose of the categorical items is to determine the context and motivational aspects of the current actions (these items include: time, location, companionship/desire for companionship, activity being performed, reason for performing activity). Because these questions are open-ended, the answers need to be coded by researchers. This needs to be done carefully so as to avoid any biases in the statistical analysis. The scaled items are intended to measure the levels of a variety of subjective feelings that the individual may be experiencing. The ESM is more complex than the FQ and contributes to the understanding of how flow plays out in a variety of situations, however the possible biases make it a risky choice. Standardized scales Some researchers are not satisfied with the methods mentioned above and have set out to create their own scales. The scales developed by Jackson and Eklund are the most commonly used in research, mainly because they are still consistent with Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi's definition of flow and consider flow as being both a state and a trait. Jackson and Eklund created two scales that have been proven to be psychometrically valid and reliable: the flow state scale-2 (which measures flow as a state) and the dispositional flow scale-2 (designed to measure flow as either a general trait or domain-specific trait). The statistical analysis of the individual results from these scales gives a much more complete understanding of flow than the ESM and the FQ. Conditions A flow state can be entered while performing any activity, although it is most likely to occur when one is wholeheartedly performing a task or activity for intrinsic purposes. Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state.Csikszentmih√°lyi, M., Larson, R., & Prescott, S. (1977). The ecology of adolescent activity and experience. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 6, 281-294.Delle Fave, A., & Bassi, M. (2000). The quality of experience in adolescents' daily lives: Developmental perspectives. Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 126, 347-367. While the activities that induce flow may vary and be multifaceted, Csikszentmih√°lyi asserts that the experience of flow is similar despite the activity.Csikszentmihayli, M. (2000). Happiness, flow, and economic equality. \\"American Psychologist, 55\\" 1163-1164. Flow theory postulates three conditions that have to be met to achieve a flow state: * One must be involved in an activity with a clear set of goals and progress. This adds direction and structure to the task. * The task at hand must have clear and immediate feedback. This helps the person negotiate any changing demands and allows them to adjust their performance to maintain the flow state. * One must have a good balance between the perceived challenges of the task at hand and their own perceived skills. One must have confidence in one's ability to complete the task at hand. However, it was argued that the antecedent factors of flow are interrelated, as a perceived balance between challenges and skills requires that one knows what they have to do (clear goals) and how successful they are in doing it (immediate feedback). Thus, a perceived fit of skills and task demands can be identified as the central precondition of flow experiences.Keller, J., & Landh√§u√üer, A. (2012). The flow model revisited. In S. Engeser (Ed.), Advances in flow research (pp. 51-64). New York: Springer. In 1987, Massimini, Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi and Carli published the eight-channel model of flow shown here.Massimini, F., Csikszentmih√°lyi, M., & Carli, M. (1987). The monitoring of optimal experience: A tool for psychiatric rehabilitation. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 175(9), 545-549. doi:10.1097/00005053-198709000-00006 Antonella Delle Fave, who worked with Fausto Massimini at the University of Milan, now calls this graph the Experience Fluctuation Model.Delle Fave, A., Massimini, F., & Bassi, M. (2011). Psychological selection and optimal experience across cultures: Social empowerment through personal growth (Vol. 2). Springer Science & Business Media. The Experience Fluctuation Model depicts the channels of experience that result from different levels of perceived challenges and perceived skills. This graph illustrates one further aspect of flow: it is more likely to occur when the activity at hand is a higher-than-average challenge (above the center point) and the individual has above-average skills (to the right of the center point). The center of this graph (where the sectors meet) represents one's average levels of challenge and skill across all activities an individual performs during their daily life. The further from the center an experience is, the greater the intensity of that state of being (whether it is flow or anxiety or boredom or relaxation). Several problems of this model have been discussed in literature.Moneta, G. B. (2012). On the measurement and conceptualization of flow. In S. Engeser (Ed.), Advances in flow research (pp. 23-50). New York: Springer. One is that it does not ensure a perceived balance between challenges and skills which is supposed to be the central precondition of flow experiences. Individuals with a low average level of skills and a high average level of challenges (or the other way round) do not necessarily experience a fit between skills and challenges when both are above their individual average.Ellis, G. D., Voelkl, J. E., & Morris, C. (1994). Measurement and analysis issues with explanation of variance in daily experience using the flow model. Journal of Leisure Research, 26, 337. In addition, one study found that low challenge situations which were surpassed by skill were associated with enjoyment, relaxation, and happiness, which, they claim, is contrary to flow theory. Schaffer (2013) proposed seven flow conditions: * Knowing what to do * Knowing how to do it * Knowing how well you are doing * Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved) * High perceived challenges * High perceived skills * Freedom from distractions Schaffer also published a measure, the flow condition questionnaire (FCQ), to measure each of these seven flow conditions for any given task or activity. Challenges to staying Some of the challenges to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being in a state of apathy is characterized when challenges are low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. A state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a state of flow, in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level. Consequently, Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi has said, \\"If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills.\\" The autotelic personality Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi hypothesized that people with several very specific personality traits may be better able to achieve flow more often than the average person. These personality traits include curiosity, persistence, low self-centeredness, and a high rate of performing activities for intrinsic reasons only. People with most of these personality traits are said to have an autotelic personality. The term ‚Äúautotelic‚Äù is acquired from two Greek words, auto, meaning self, and telos meaning goal. Being Autotelic means having a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply to experience it as the main goal. At this point, there is not much research on the autotelic personality, but results of the few studies that have been conducted suggest that indeed some people are more prone to experience flow than others. One researcher (Abuhamdeh, 2000) found that people with an autotelic personality have a greater preference for \\"high-action-opportunity, high-skills situations that stimulate them and encourage growth\\" compared to those without an autotelic personality. It is in such high-challenge, high- skills situations that people are most likely to enter the flow state. Experimental evidence shows that a balance between skills of the individual and demands of the task (compared to boredom and overload) only elicits flow experiences in individuals characterized by an internal locus of controlKeller, J., & Blomann, F. (2008). Locus of control and the flow experience. An experimental analyses. European Journal of Personality, 22, 589-607. or a habitual action orientation.Keller, J., & Bless, H. (2008). Flow and regulatory compatibility: An experimental approach to flow model of intrinsic motivation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 34, 196-209. Several correlational studies found need for achievement to be a personal characteristic that fosters flow experiences.Engeser, S., & Rheinberg, F. (2008). Flow, performance and moderators of challenge-skill balance. Motivation and Emotion, 32, 158-172.Sch√ºler, J. (2007). Arousal of flow experience in a learning setting and its effects on exam performance and affect. Zeitschrift f√ºr P√§dagogische Psychologie, 21, 217-227.Eisenberger, R., Jones, J. R., Stinglhamber, F., Shanock, L., & Randall, A. T. (2005). Flow experiences at work: for high need achievers alone? Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26, 755-775. Group Group flow is notably different from independent flow as it is inherently mutual. Group flow is attainable when the performance unit is a group, such as a team or musical group. When groups cooperate to agree on goals and patterns, social flow, commonly known as group cohesion, is much more likely to occur. If a group still has not entered flow, a team-level challenge may stimulate the group to harmonize.Walker, C. J. (2010). Experiencing flow: Is doing it together better than doing it alone?, \\"The Journal of Positive Psychology, 5,\\" 3-11. Applications Applications suggested by Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi versus other practitioners Only Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi seems to have published suggestions for extrinsic applications of the flow concept, such as design methods for playgrounds to elicit the flow experience. Other practitioners of Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi's flow concept focus on intrinsic applications, such as spirituality, performance improvement, or self-help. His work has also informed the measurement of donor momentum by The New Science of Philanthropy. Education Young child, painting a model In education, the concept of overlearning plays a role in a student's ability to achieve flow. Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi states that overlearning enables the mind to concentrate on visualizing the desired performance as a singular, integrated action instead of a set of actions. Challenging assignments that (slightly) stretch one's skills lead to flow. In the 1950s British cybernetician Gordon Pask designed an adaptive teaching machine called SAKI, an early example of \\"e-learning\\". The machine is discussed in some detail in Stafford Beer's book \\"Cybernetics and Management\\". In the patent application for SAKI (1956), Pask's comments (some of which are included below) indicate an awareness of the pedagogical importance of balancing student competence with didactic challenge, which is quite consistent with flow theory: Around 2000, it came to the attention of Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi that the principles and practices of the Montessori Method of education seemed to purposefully set up continuous flow opportunities and experiences for students. Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi and psychologist Kevin Rathunde embarked on a multi-year study of student experiences in Montessori settings and traditional educational settings. The research supported observations that students achieved flow experiences more frequently in Montessori settings. Music Musicians, especially improvisational soloists, may experience a state of flow while playing their instrument. Research has shown that performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to when they are not in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved. Groups of drummers experience a state of flow when they sense a collective energy that drives the beat, something they refer to as getting into the groove or entrainment. Likewise drummers and bass guitarists often describe a state of flow when they are feeling the downbeat together as being in the pocket. Researchers have measured flow through subscales; challenge- skill balance, merging of action and awareness, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, total concentration, sense of control, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time and autotelic experience. Sports Flow may occur in challenging sports such as eventing. The concept of being in the zone during an athletic performance fits within Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi's description of the flow experience, and theories and applications of being in the zone and its relationship with athletic competitive advantage are topics studied in the field of sport psychology. Timothy Gallwey's influential works on the \\"inner game\\" of sports such as golf and tennis described the mental coaching and attitudes required to \\"get in the zone\\" and fully internalize mastery of the sport. Roy Palmer suggests that \\"being in the zone\\" may also influence movement patterns as better integration of the conscious and subconscious reflex functions improves coordination. Many athletes describe the effortless nature of their performance while achieving personal bests. In many martial arts, the term Bud≈ç is used to describe psychological flow. Mixed martial arts champion and Karate master Lyoto Machida uses meditation techniques before fights to attain mushin, a concept that, by his description, is in all respects equal to flow. The Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, during qualifying for the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, explained: \\"I was already on pole, [...] and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car. And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension. It was like I was in a tunnel.\\" Former 500 GP rider Wayne Gardner talking about his victory at the 1990 Australian Grand Prix on The Unrideables 2 documentary said: During these last five laps I had this sort of above body experience where actually raised up above and I could see myself racing. It was kind of a remote control and it's the weirdest thing I've ever had in my life. [...] After the race Mick [Doohan] and in fact Wayne Rainey said: How the hell did you do that? and I said: I have no idea.' Religion and spirituality In yogic traditions such as Raja Yoga, reference is made to a state of flow in the practice of Samyama, a psychological absorption in the object of meditation. Games and gaming Flow in games and gaming has been linked to the laws of learning as part of the explanation for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective. In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, which is part of the law of readiness. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the law of exercise. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback. The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the law of effect. The intense experiences of being in a state of flow are directly associated with the law of intensity. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the laws of learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow. In games often much can be achieved thematically through an imbalance between challenge level and skill level. Horror games often keep challenges significantly above the player's level of competency in order to foster a continuous feeling of anxiety. Conversely, so called \\"relaxation games\\" keep the level of challenges significantly below the player's competency level, in order to achieve an opposite effect. The video game Flow was designed as part of Jenova Chen's master's thesis for exploring the design decisions that allow players to achieve the flow state, by adjusting the difficulty dynamically during play. It improves performance; calling the phenomenon \\"TV trance\\", a 1981 BYTE article discussed how \\"the best seem to enter a trance where they play but don't pay attention to the details of the game\\". The primary goal of games is to create entertainment through intrinsic motivation, which is related to flow; that is, without intrinsic motivation it is virtually impossible to establish flow.Paul Benjamin Lowry, James Gaskin, Nathan W. Twyman, Bryan Hammer, and Tom L. Roberts (2013). \\"Taking 'fun and games' seriously: Proposing the hedonic- motivation system adoption model (HMSAM),\\" Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS), vol. 14(11), 617‚Äì671. Through the balance of skill and challenge the player's brain is aroused, with attention engaged and motivation high. Thus, the use of flow in games helps foster an enjoyable experience which in turn increases motivation and draws players to continue playing. As such, game designers strive to integrate flow principles into their projects. Overall, the experience of play is fluid and is intrinsically psychologically rewarding independent of scores or in-game successes in the flow state. Design of intrinsically motivated computer systems A simplified modification to flow has been combined with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS- specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoptionHans Van der Heijden (2004) User Acceptance of Hedonic Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, vol. 28(4), pp. 695-704 by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent \\"intrinsic motivations\\" by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that is grounded in the seminal flow literature, yet CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time‚Äîin direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach. Professions and work Developers of computer software reference getting into a flow state as \\"wired in\\", or sometimes as The Zone, hack mode, or operating on software time when developing in an undistracted state. Stock market operators often use the term \\"in the pipe\\" to describe the psychological state of flow when trading during high volume days and market corrections. Professional poker players use the term \\"playing the A-game\\" when referring to the state of highest concentration and strategical awareness, while pool players often call the state being in \\"dead stroke\\". In the workplace Conditions of flow, defined as a state in which challenges and skills are equally matched, play an extremely important role in the workplace. Because flow is associated with achievement, its development could have concrete implications in increasing workplace satisfaction and accomplishment. Flow researchers, such as Csikszentmih√°lyi, believe that certain interventions may be performed to enhance and increase flow in the workplace, through which people would gain 'intrinsic rewards that encourage persistence\\" and provide benefits. In his consultation work, Csikszentmih√°lyi emphasizes finding activities and environments that are conducive to flow, and then identifying and developing personal characteristics to increase experiences of flow. Applying these methods in the workplace, can improve morale by fostering a sense of greater happiness and accomplishment, which may be correlated with increased performance. In his review of Mih√°ly Csikszentmih√°lyi's book \\"Good Business: Leadership, Flow, and the Making of Meaning,\\" Coert Visser introduces the ideas presented by Csikszentmih√°lyi, including \\"good work\\" in which one \\"enjoys doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself.\\" He then provides tools by which managers and employees can create an atmosphere that encourages good work. Some consultants suggest that the experience sampling form (EMS) method be used for individuals and teams in the workplace in order to identify how time is currently being spent, and where focus should be redirected to in order to increase flow experiences. In order to achieve flow, Csikszentmih√°lyi lays out the following three conditions: * Goals are clear * Feedback is immediate * A balance exists between opportunity and capacity Csikszentmih√°lyi argues that with increased experiences of flow, people experience \\"growth towards complexity\\". People flourish as their achievements grow and with that comes development of increasing \\"emotional, cognitive, and social complexity.\\" Creating a workplace atmosphere that allows for flow and growth, Csikszentmih√°lyi argues, can increase the happiness and achievement of employees. An increasingly popular way of promoting greater flow in the workplace is using the \\"serious play\\" facilitation methods. Some commercial organisations have used the concept of flow in building corporate branding and identity for example The Floow Limited which created its company brand from the concept. Barriers There are, however, barriers to achieving flow in the workplace. In his chapter \\"Why Flow Doesn't Happen on the Job,\\" Csikszentmih√°lyi argues the first reason that flow does not occur is that the goals of one's job are not clear. He explains that while some tasks at work may fit into a larger, organization plan, the individual worker may not see where their individual task fits it. Second, limited feedback about one's work can reduce motivation and leaves the employee unaware of whether or not they did a good job. When there is little communication of feedback, an employee may not be assigned tasks that challenge them or seem important, which could potentially prevent an opportunity for flow. In the study \\"Predicting flow at work: Investigating the activities and job characteristics that predict flow states at work\\", Karina Nielsen and Bryan Cleal used a 9-item flow scale to examine predictors of flow at two levels: activity level (such as brainstorming, problem solving, and evaluation) and at a more stable level (such as role clarity, influence, and cognitive demands). They found that activities such as planning, problem solving, and evaluation predicted transient flow states, but that more stable job characteristics were not found to predict flow at work. This study can help us identify which task at work can be cultivated and emphasized in order to help employees experience flow on the job. In her article in Positive Psychology News Daily, Kathryn Britton examines the importance of experiencing flow in the workplace beyond the individual benefits it creates. She writes, \\"Flow isn't just valuable to individuals; it also contributes to organizational goals. For example, frequent experiences of flow at work lead to higher productivity, innovation, and employee development (Csikszentmih√°lyi, 1991, 2004). So finding ways to increase the frequency of flow experiences can be one way for people to work together to increase the effectiveness of their workplaces.\\" Outcomes Positive experiences Books by Csikszentmih√°lyi suggest that enhancing the time spent in flow makes our lives more happy and successful. Flow experiences are predicted to lead to positive affect as well as to better performance.Csikszentmih√°lyi, M. (1997). Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life. New York: Basic Books. For example, delinquent behavior was reduced in adolescents after two years of enhancing flow through activities.Nakamura, J., & Csikszentmih√°lyi, M. (year). \\"The concept of flow.\\" In Handbook of Positive Psychology (89‚Äì105). New York, NY: Oxford University Press. People who have experienced flow, describe the following feelings: # Completely involved in what we are doing ‚Äì focused, concentrated. # A sense of ecstasy ‚Äì of being outside everyday reality. # Great inner clarity ‚Äì knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing. # Knowing that the activity is doable ‚Äì that our skills are adequate to the task. # A sense of serenity ‚Äì no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego. # Timelessness ‚Äì thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute. # Intrinsic motivation ‚Äì whatever produces flow becomes its own reward. However, further empirical evidence is required to substantiate these preliminary indications, as flow researchers continue to explore the problem of how to directly investigate causal consequences of flow experiences using modern scientific instrumentation to observe the neuro-physiological correlates of the flow state.Landh√§u√üer, A., & Keller, J. (2012). \\"Flow and its affective, cognitive, and performance-related consequences.\\" In S. Engeser (Ed.), Advances in Flow Research (pp.65‚Äì86). New York: Springer. Positive affect and life satisfaction Flow is an innately positive experience; it is known to \\"produce intense feelings of enjoyment\\". An experience that is so enjoyable should lead to positive affect and happiness in the long run. Also, Csikszentmih√°lyi stated that happiness is derived from personal development and growth ‚Äì and flow situations permit the experience of personal development. Several studies found that flow experiences and positive affect go hand in hand,Rheinberg, F., Manig, Y., Kliegl, R., Engeser, S., & Vollmeyer, R. (2007).

Zielausrichtung, Flow und Gl√ºcksgef√ºhle [Flow during work but happiness during leisure time: goals, flow-experience, and happiness]. , 51, 105‚Äì115. and that challenges and skills above the individual's average foster positive affect.Clarke, S. G., & Haworth, J. T. (1994). \\"Flow\\" experience in the daily lives of sixth-form college students. British Journal of Psychology, 85, 511‚Äì523.Massimini, F., & Carli, M.

However, the causal processes underlying those relationships remains unclear at present. Performance and learning Flow experiences imply a growth principle. When one is in a flow state, they are working to master the activity at hand. To maintain that flow state, one must seek increasingly greater challenges. Attempting these new, difficult challenges stretches one's skills. One emerges from such a flow experience with a bit of personal growth and great \\"feelings of competence and efficacy\\". By increasing time spent in flow, intrinsic motivation and self- directed learning also increases.Hektner, J.M. & Csikszentmih√°lyi, M. (1996). \\"A longitudinal exploration of flow an intrinsic motivation in adolescents.\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American education research association, New York. Alfred Sloan Foundation. Flow has a documented correlation with high performance in the fields of artistic and scientific creativity,Perry, 1999Sawyer, 1992 teaching,Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi, 1996 learning,Cs√≠kszentmih√°lyi et al., 1993 and sports;Jackson, Thomas, Marsh, & Smethurst, 2002Stein, Kimiecik, Daniels, & Jackson, 1995) Flow has been linked to persistence and achievement in activities while also helping to lower anxiety during various activities and raise self-esteem.Nakamura, J., & Csikszentmih√°lyi, M. (2014). \\"The concept of flow.\\" Handbook of Positive Psychology, 89‚Äì105. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. However, evidence regarding better performance in flow situations is mixed. For sure, the association between the two is a reciprocal one. That is, flow experiences may foster better performance but, on the other hand, good performance makes flow experiences more likely. Results of a longitudinal study in the academic context indicate that the causal effect of flow on performance is only of small magnitude and the strong relationship between the two is driven by an effect of performance on flow. In the long run, flow experiences in a specific activity may lead to higher performance in that activity as flow is positively correlated with a higher subsequent motivation to perform and to perform well. Criticism Csikszentmih√°lyi writes about the dangers of flow himself: > ...enjoyable activities that produce flow have a potentially negative > effect: while they are capable of improving the quality of existence by > creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at which point the > self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then unwilling to > cope with the ambiguities of life. Further, he writes: > The flow experience, like everything else, is not \\"good\\" in an absolute > sense. It is good only in that it has the potential to make life more rich, > intense, and meaningful; it is good because it increases the strengths and > complexity of the self. But whether the consequence of any particular > instance of flow is good in a larger sense needs to be discussed and > evaluated in terms of more inclusive social criteria.

Synopsis Robert Bellamy, an agent of the ONI receives a mission on behalf of NSA: to locate the witnesses of the crash of an experimental meteorological balloon in Switzerland, for which he is only given the date, the place where it happened, and the fact that the witnesses were passengers of a bus tour. He is given an unlimited budget but is told he must work strictly under cover. After he finds the first witness, he discovers that the meteorological balloon was actually an alien spaceship. He tracks the witnesses one by one and reports their names to NSA. Without his knowledge, the names of the witnesses are then communicated to the intelligence organizations of their respective countries, and each of them is assassinated shortly after. These actions are coordinated under the name \\"Operation Doomsday\\", under the leadership of a figure known only as Janus. Robert's personal history is shown through flashbacks: he rose in the military ranks under the mentorship of Admiral Ralph Whittaker, and during a combat flight in Vietnam his plane was taken down, with Whittaker son's dying in the crash and Robert being badly injured. Doctors declare that he has no chance of survival, but a nurse named Susan convinces them to operate on him and encourages him to keep his fighting spirit. He and Susan fall in love after his recovery and marry. Robert is then recruited to become a spy for ONI, but this job takes over his personal life until Susan divorces him and marries a business tycoon named Monte Banks, while Robert isolates himself and dedicates even more to his work. In a conversation with the last witness, he mentions to Robert an additional one, a woman whom he hadn't seen in the bus. When Robert tries to contact the other bus passengers to corroborate this information, he finds out that all of them are dead. He deduces that this is an international effort since they died in different countries, and he also concludes that the final step of the operation would be his own death to eliminate all knowledge about the alien ship. He then goes into hiding right as Janus sends an instruction to kill him. Robert goes for help to Li, one of his friends who lives in Paris. Li explains to him about Operation Doomsday, revealing that aliens have been in communication with the governments of Earth for a while, demanding a stop of industrial pollution to save the Earth's environment, before revealing that he is a member of the operation and shooting Robert. Robert wins the fight and kills him, but he is badly wounded and realizes that he will eventually be killed unless he negotiates. The mysterious last witness is revealed to be an alien that survived the crash of the spaceship and disguised herself as a woman. She contacts Robert through a piece of the spaceship that he got from one of the witnesses, and they arrange to meet back in Switzerland where the ship crashed. Robert also calls NSA and asks to meet Janus there. In the final confrontation, Janus is revealed to be Admiral Whittaker, Robert's mentor. He also confesses that he sabotaged Robert's marriage to keep him at ONI, and eventually decided to have him killed for not being committed enough to his job. Monte Banks is revealed to be part of the Doomsday conspiracy, as he owns many industries that would lose money if they weren't able to pollute. Both are abducted by the aliens, who task Robert with the mission of spreading environmental awareness on Earth. Influence Dan Brown, the author of The Da Vinci Code, named The Doomsday Conspiracy as the book that inspired him to write thriller fiction, citing its \\"simplicity of the prose and efficiency of the storyline\\".The two sources provided here differ on how Sheldon inspired Brown. He indicates on Page 3 of his 2006 witness statement that Sheldon's book was an attention-holding page turner that reminded him how fun it was to read, but the BBC source indicates that he thought he could \\"do better\\" than Sheldon.

It is a former coal mining town. the built-up area had a population 7,945https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W38000018 with the wider urban area even bigger. According to the 2001 census, 75.88% of the population were competent in the Welsh language, compared to roughly 61% in Carmarthenshire as a whole and 21.8% in Wales as a whole. Ammanford is served by the A483 and A474 roads. Ammanford railway station is a stop on the Heart of Wales Line, with trains to Llanelli and Swansea to the south and Shrewsbury to the north. Ammanford is twinned with Breuillet, Essonne.  History  The town of Ammanford is a relatively modern settlement. It was originally known as Cross Inn, named after an inn that was located at a location where a number of roads converged. During the nineteenth century, as a result of the growth of both the tinplate and anthracite coal trades, a village grew around the Cross Inn (which later became known as Ammanford Square). As the settlement expanded, prominent residents came to the view that its name should be changed since there were a number of other places named Cross Inn in Carmarthenshire alone. In 1880, a number of public meetings were held, and in November 1880 it was resolved that the name 'Ammanford' be adopted. The meeting was chaired by Watcyn Wyn. It took several years for the new name to be widely adopted, but the decision of the Great Western Railway to change the name of the Cross Inn station to Ammanford in June 1883 was welcomed by residents and tradesmen. Government Parliamentary Elections Ammanford was part of the Carmarthenshire county constituency until it was divided in 1885 whereupon the town was located in the East Carmarthen constituency which was held until its abolition in 1918 by the Liberal Party. The Labour Party captured Llanelli in 1922 and have held it ever since. The MP from 1936 until 1970 was Jim Griffiths, a native of nearby Betws. However, in 1997, Ammanford was transferred to the new Carmarthen East and Dinefwr seat which was captured in 2001 by Adam Price of Plaid Cymru. Local Government Ammanford was part of Carmarthenshire County Council from 1889 until 1974 and was usually represented by Labour councillors. It became part of Dyfed County Council from 1974 until 1996. Following the abolition of Dyfed it became, once again, part of Carmarthenshire, now a unitary authority. Ammanford Urban District Council was formed in 1903 in consequence of sharp population growth. It was absorbed into Dinefwr Borough Council upon re-organization in 1974. Dinefwr in turn was absorbed into the Carmarthenshire unitary authority in 1996. Ammanford's Town Council has continued as a community council. The community is bordered by the communities of: Llandybie; Betws; and Llanedi, all being in Carmarthenshire. Religion Ammanford is in the ecclesiastical parish of Ammanford and Betws. Ammanford formed part of the ancient parish of Llandybie although the parish church at Betws was much closer to the town. The established church was, however, slow to react to the growth of an urban community. The nonconformist denominations, in contrast, were far more active and Ammanford was an important location as the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival unfolded. Prominent chapels include Ebenezer (Baptist), Gelliamnwydd (Christian Temple) (Congregationalist) and Bethany (Calvinistic Methodist). There is an active Christadelphian community based in the town centre.Ammanford Christadelphians, accessed 25 January 2018  Twentieth century  The Ammanford Anthracite Strike was a riot at Ammanford in 1925 during a strike by anthracite miners who took control of the town by force and violence for 10 days. 200 Glamorgan police were ambushed by strikers at Pontamman Bridge during the so-called 'Battle of Ammanford'.Ammanford Anthracite Strike 1925 Mal Davies Ammanford hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1922 and 1970.

This prinia is a resident breeder in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. Like other prinias, it often holds the tail upright but it is easily told by a smoky grey band across the breast which contrasts with a white throat. The beak is all black while the legs are pink. The tail is graduated as in other prinias and the grey feathers are tipped in white. In the breeding plumage the upperparts are grey while non-breeding birds are pale above with rufous wings and a weak supercilium. It is found in scrub, forest clearings and other open but well vegetated habitats. It can be confused with the rufescent prinia. Taxonomy This species was named by James Franklin as Prinia gracilis in 1831 based on a specimen that he obtained on the Ganges between Calcutta and Benares. It was renamed as Prinia hodgsonii by Edward Blyth in 1844 since the name Sylvia gracilis had been in use for the graceful prinia (described earlier in 1823 by Martin Lichtenstein) clashed when treated in the same genus Prinia. It was also described as Prinia adamsi by Jerdon and as Prinia humilis by Hume. This was placed in a separate genus Franklinia by Blyth and this treatment was followed by Jerdon and by others including Hugh Whistler who separated this species from the genus Prinia and placed it in the genus Franklinia which he considered distinct on the basis of having twelve tail feathers rather than ten and in having distinct breeding and non-breeding plumages. The merging of Prinia and Franklinia was supported by H. G. Deignan. The species has a widespread distribution and populations that show distinct plumages have been described as subspecies: * P. h. hodgsonii Blyth, 1844 \\\\- the nominate subspecies is a resident of the Indian Peninsula from the Gangetic plains to Mysore in the south and extending east to Bangladesh. This loses the breast band in the non-breeding season and moults into grey-olive upperparts. * P. h. rufula Godwin-Austen, 1874 \\\\- is a resident in the Himalayan foothills from lower Swat in Pakistan to Arunachal Pradesh in eastern India. It makes altitudinal movements descending south in winter. This has a tinge of rufous on the flanks and on the upper-body. * P. h. albogularis Walden, 1870 \\\\- of the Western Ghats has the broadest and darkest breast band. * P. h. pectoralis Legge, 1874 \\\\- is resident in the eastern and southeastern part of Sri Lanka. It sports the grey breast-band throughout the year. The band is incomplete in the middle for females. An alternate name of P. h. leggei was proposed due to the idea that it might clash with the name of Malcorus pectoralis but the original name is retained since the other species is placed in a different genus. * P. h. erro Deignan, 1942 \\\\- geographic range from East Myanmar to Thailand and South Indochina. * P. h. confusa Deignan, 1942 \\\\- geographic range from South China to Northeast Laos and N Vietnam. Description Non- breeding nominate subspecies with short supercilium and olive brown upperparts (Hyderabad, India) These long warblers have a longish grey tail with graduated feathers that are tipped in white, they have strong pinkish legs and a short black bill. The eye ring is orange. The sexes look alike in most populations except in P .h. pectoralis of Sri Lanka where the female can be told apart by the incomplete breast band. The underparts are buff white and the grey breast band contrasts with the white throat in the breeding season. They have a rufous wing panel and the upperparts are smoky grey during the breeding season and olive brown in the non-breeding period. Non-breeding birds have a short indistinct white supercilium and often lack the breast band. Young birds are like non-breeding adults but more rufous above. The distinctive greyer endemic race in Sri Lanka, P. h. pectoralis, retains the summer-type plumage all year round. Young birds have a pale lower mandible. The tail feathers are shorter in summer than in the non-breeding winter plumage. Habitat and distribution This skulking passerine bird is typically found in open woodland, scrub jungle, bushes and hedgerows amidst cultivation. Also found in bamboo jungle, mangrove swamps and reeds. P. h. rufula has been observed in patches of sugarcane near Kathmandu valley. It is a common resident of the Indian peninsula. It migrates slightly south during winter. The distribution extends from Himalayan foothills to Southern India and to eastern Indian states Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Assam. The species distribution extends to Pakistan, Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Yunnan province in southern China. Its altitude ranges from plains and goes up to 1000 meters (3280 ft) P. h. hodgsonii and up to 1800 meters (5900 ft) P. h. rufula in Meghalaya. Behavior and ecology The graduated tail with white tips is visible from below (Andhra Pradesh) Like most warblers, grey-breasted prinias are insectivorous. They feeds mainly on insects like ants, small beetles, caterpillars which are found among twigs and foliage of small trees. They also feeds on nectar from blossoms of trees like Erythrina and Bombax and during summer their forehead is sometimes sprinkled with pollen giving them an orange or yellowish head that can lead to mistaken identification. Usually found in pairs or small groups, they sometimes forms parties of five or more (up to twenty) individuals. It jerks its tail as it flits between branches. The breeding season begins with the rains. The male sings from a high perch and also performs aerobatic manoeuvers with rising and falling before diving with song notes. The song is a squeaky series of calls: ' (or '). The nest is a cup of grass placed between leaves that are sewn together with cobwebs and resembles the nest of a common tailorbird but tends to be placed closer to the ground. The typical clutch consists of three or four eggs. The eggs vary in colour and they include glossy blue, pinkish white, greenish-blue or even pure white. They usually have reddish brown speckles at the broad end. Both parents incubate the eggs which hatch after about ten to eleven days. More than one brood may be raised in a season. References Call In breeding season, the male gives a spirited performance from an exposed perch excitedly warbling his squeaky yousee-yousee-yousee-which-which-which song. A conversational call-note, zee zee zee is uttered as the birds move along.

Early life and move to the United States Awad, a Palestinian Christian (a member of the Greek Orthodox Church), was born in 1943 in Jerusalem when it was under the British Mandate. When Awad was five years old, his father was killed during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and he became a refugee in the Old City of Jerusalem. His mother was a pacifist and argued against revenge. He was given the right to Israeli citizenship in 1967 when East Jerusalem was annexed by Israel after the Six-Day War but refused and kept his Jordanian citizenship.Mubarak Awad Was Israel justified in expelling him? Mennonite and Quaker missionaries influenced Awad's views in his youth. In the 1960s he moved to the United States to study at the Mennonite Bluffton University and received a BA in social work and sociology. He went on to obtain an MS in education from Saint Francis University and a PhD in psychology from the International Graduate School of Saint Louis University. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 1978 and settled in a small town in Ohio. Career National Youth Advocate Program Awad was the founder and former president of the National Youth Advocate Program (NYAP) in the United States. The organization developed from the Ohio Youth Advocate Program (OYAP) established by Awad in 1978 with support from the Ohio Youth Commission (now the Department of Youth Services), the state department responsible for finding placements for \\"at risk\\" youth referred to the state from county juvenile courts. As an offshoot of NYAP, he later founded and directed Youth Advocate Program International, headquartered in Washington, DC. According to the website, \\"The Youth Advocate Program International, Inc. (YAP International) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It established its headquarters and advocacy center in Washington, DC in 1996. YAP International's mission is to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the world's youth, giving particular attention to children victimized by conflict, exploitation, and state and personal violence.\\" Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence In 1983 Awad returned to Jerusalem and established the Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence. Before the intifada, Awad published papers and lectured on nonviolence as a technique for resisting the Israeli occupation. He wrote that nonviolence could be used as a means of resistance. The Centre also sponsored a number of nonviolent actions during the early months on the first intifada. Among the tactics employed was the planting of olive trees on proposed Israeli settlements, asking people not to pay taxes and encouraging people to eat and drink Palestinian products. In the Middle East he is often referred to as the Arab Gandhi due to the similarity between his teachings of the power of nonviolence and those of Mahatma Gandhi in India during the British Raj. He believed these tactics could be used to resist the Israeli military occupation. He also drew upon the methodologies of Gene Sharp's trilogy, The Politics of Non-Violence. Using this knowledge and his experience, Awad prepared his own \\"12-page blueprint for passive resistance in the territories,\\" eventually published in the Journal of Palestine Studies. He has translated into Arabic the teachings of Mohatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. In 2015 he asserted that disciplined civil disobedience, involving the tearing up of Israeli ID cards, refusing to obey curfew orders, tearing fences down, and planting trees wherever settlements were being planned were among many non-violent options Palestinian should adopt, standing up for themselves with only their bodies and hearts in order to compel the occupier to \\"choose what kind of people they are\\".Jonathan Cook, \\"Smart Resistance: a Palestinian Call for \\"Unarmed Warfare\\",\\" CounterPunch 12 November 2015 In 1998 Holy Land Trust (HLT) was established out of PCSN and The Journey of the Magi (JOM) by Sami Awad, Mubarak Awad's nephew. Deportation by Israel In 1987, Awad attempted to renew the residency permit he had been issued in 1967. His application was declined and he was ordered to leave the country when his tourist visa expired. Awad claimed, with strong support from U.S. consular officials, that under international conventions Israel did not have the right to expel him from his place of birth and he refused to leave. The Israeli government stayed the deportation order mainly at the insistence of the U.S. In May 1988, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad arrested and expelled. Officials charged that Awad broke Israeli law by inciting \\"civil uprising\\" and helping to write leaflets that advocated civil disobedience that were distributed by the leadership of the First Intifada. No evidence was provided to support the charge and Awad appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The court ruled that he had forfeited his right to residence status in Israel when he became a U.S. citizen and he was deported in June 1988. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's appeal to Shamir to revoke the deportation order was declined. Ian Lustick, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, cited the ruling in Awad's case as one of a number of examples that he argues demonstrate that \\"[t]here has never been an official act that has declared expanded East Jerusalem as having been annexed by the State of Israel.\\"  Criticism  Critics argue that Awad advocated violence under the guise of calling it civil disobedience. In a 1984 article for the Journal of Palestine Studies, Awad stated, \\"for the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza the most effective strategy is nonviolence. This does not apply to the Palestinians living outside. Nor is it a rejection of the concept of armed struggle. This is nothing short of war.\\" Awad called to \\"block roads, prevent communications, cut electricity, telephone, and water lines, prevent the movement of equipment, and in other ways obstruct the government.\\" The article speaks openly about throwing stones. Awad's article called for a campaign of harassment against Israelis and for \\"psychological warfare\\" to \\"demoralize\\" the population. He also called for \\"the destruction of Israeli fences and power lines,\\" according to Time Magazine. Awad has called for Israel to be replaced with Palestine. In a Jerusalem speech to Palestinian students he said \\"the PLO wants the entire Palestine and I agree. Palestine for me is the Galilee, Akko, Ashdod, everything. This is Palestine for me.\\" Dr. Shlomo Riskin called him \\"an articulate wolf in sheep\`s clothing\\" who \\"clearly represents a threat to the lives of Israeli citizens.\\" Israeli diplomat Moshe Arad in a New York Times article decried Awad whom he claimed took American citizenship, in accordance with immigration law, which required that he 'intends to reside permanently in the U.S. and then turned around and claimed to the Israeli Supreme Court that his intention was always to reside in Jerusalem. \\"Nonviolence as merely a convenient tactic... incitement and acts of violence - are these the watchwords of a man truly committed to peace and moderation? No. Western audiences do not hear these Awad views in English. But his local audiences hear them in Arabic,\\" Arad said. Nonviolence International In 1989, Awad founded Nonviolence International, a non- governmental organization in Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Nonviolence International's stated mission is to promote nonviolent action and seek to reduce the use of violence worldwide. Academic career Awad has taught at the American University in Washington, D.C. since the early 1990s. He is an Adjunct Professor in the School of International Service where he teaches classes in the theories and methods of nonviolence.

Life He was the third son of Richard Venn, vicar of St Antholin, Budge Row in London. He was educated at the University of Cambridge from 1742, studying at St John's and Jesus colleges; he graduated B.A. in 1745 and M.A. in 1749. He also played cricket, for All England against Surrey. Venn took orders in 1747, and was elected fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1749. After holding a curacy at Barton, Cambridgeshire, he became curate of both St Matthew, Friday Street, in the City of London, and of West Horsley, Surrey, in 1750. Local clergy already considered him a Methodist (in later terms, an evangelical), since he taught Scripture in his home and the number of communicants at West Horsley increased from twelve to sixty. However, it was only at this time that his beliefs moved from the High Church views of The Whole Duty of Man to the more evangelical position of A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life. In 1754 he became curate of Clapham and was also elected lecturer of St Swithin's, London Stone and St Alban's Wood Street. From 1759 to 1771, Venn was vicar of Huddersfield Parish Church. He found a small group of like-minded Yorkshire clergy: Richard Conyers, William Grimshaw of Haworth, James Stillingfleet (1741‚Äì1826). In 1771 he exchanged to the living of Yelling, Huntingdonshire where he drew as visitors William Faris, Joseph Jowett, Thomas Robinson and Charles Simeon. He died in the rectory, and is commemorated by a plaque over the pulpit of the parish church. Works Venn was well known as the author of The Compleat Duty of Man (London, 1763), a work in which he intended to supplement the teaching embodied in the anonymous Whole Duty of Man from an evangelical perspective. Family Henry Venn's descendants also came to prominence over the succeeding generations. His son John Venn (priest) was one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). His granddaughter, by his daughter Eling, was Charlotte Elliott, writer of numerous hymns, most notably the well-loved Just as I Am. His grandson, also named Henry Venn (10 February 1796 - 13 January 1873), was honorary secretary of the Church Missionary Society from 1841 to 1873. He expounded the basic principles of indigenous Christian missions later addressed and made widespread by the Lausanne Congress of 1974. His great-grandson was the logician and philosopher John Venn, famed for the Venn diagram.

It was previously known as Portsmouth Polytechnic from 1969 until 1992, when it was granted university status through the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It is ranked among the Top 100 universities under 50 in the world. The university offers a range of disciplines, from Pharmacy, International relations and politics, to Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Paleontology, Criminology, Criminal Justice, among others. The University is a member of the University Alliance and The Channel Islands Universities Consortium. Alumni include Tim Peake, Grayson Perry, Simon Armitage and Ben Fogle. History The roots of the University can be traced back to the Portsmouth and Gosport School of Science and Art. which opened in 1870 and was funded by subscription. Technical education (including science-based subjects) later became the responsibility of the local authority, which founded Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute in 1894 to fulfil this function. However, the city required a permanent purpose-built home for technical education and as a consequence Portsmouth Municipal College was constructed on a site behind Portsmouth Guildhall. Portsmouth Municipal College opened in 1908 (the new college replaced Portsmouth Municipal Technical Institute, although many of the staff transferred to the new institution) and the building also incorporated the College of Art, Portsmouth Day Training College for teachers and a public library. The original college building is still in use by the University of Portsmouth and is now known as Park Building. In 1911 two Student Unions were established for male and female students; as early records from the Student Union newspaper The Galleon show. From 1945 to 1960 the college diversified its syllabus adding arts and humanities subjects after World War II, in response to a decline in the need for engineering skills. In 1953 the institution changed its name to Portsmouth College of Technology. The college gained polytechnic status in 1969 and by the late 1980s was one of the largest polytechnics in the UK . On 7 July 1992 the inauguration of the University of Portsmouth was celebrated at a ceremony at Portsmouth Guildhall. As a new university, it could validate its own degrees, under the provision of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. On Friday 4 May 2018, the University of Portsmouth was revealed as the main shirt sponsor of Portsmouth F.C. for the 2018‚Äì19, 2019‚Äì20 and 2020‚Äì21 seasons. Campuses The university is split between the University Quarter, which is centred around the Portsmouth Guildhall area, and the Langstone Campus. Langstone Campus Langstone is the smaller of the two campuses, located in Milton on the eastern edge of Portsea Island. The campus overlooks Langstone Harbour and it is home to the university's sports grounds. It also houses a restaurant for the students and provides accommodation for 565 students in three halls of residence: Queen Elizabeth Queen Mother (QEQM), Trust Hall and Langstone Flats. Langstone Campus used to be home of the University's School of Languages and Area Studies, which has since moved into Park Building in the University Quarter. University Quarter The University Quarter is a collection of university buildings located around the centre of the city. This area contains most of the university's teaching facilities and nearly all of the Student Halls of residence (except the Langstone student village and two halls (Rees Hall and Burrell House) located on Southsea Terrace. The University Library (formerly the Frewen Library) was extended in 2006 at a cost of ¬£11 million. It was opened by the crime writer P. D. James. The University has also recently invested in the Faculty of Science, in particular by renovating the aluminium-clad main building, St Michael's. A new faculty called \\"Creative and Cultural Industries\\" was opened in September 2006. Military Technological College of Oman On 7 June 2013, the University of Portsmouth announced its partnership with the Military Technological College of Oman. This involves the University of Portsmouth providing academic guidance and academic accreditation for the education of 4,200 students with technical roles in armed services and a few civilian employers in the Sultanate of Oman. This has been criticised by the student Amnesty International Society and by Campaign Against the Arms Trade who consider Oman an authoritarian regime, likely to use military capabilities on their own citizens or in regional conflicts.

Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 2 April 2020. ‚Äì April 11, 1983) was a Mexican actress, dancer and singer. With a career spanning more than 50 years, she is regarded as the first major female Latin American crossover star in Hollywood,The Face of Deco: Dolores Del Rio , Screendeco.wordpress.com, May 18, 2012. with an outstanding career in American cinema in the 1920s and 1930s. She was also considered one of the most important female figures in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Del R√≠o is also remembered as one of the most beautiful faces on screen of all time. After being discovered in Mexico, she began her film career in Hollywood in 1925. She had roles on a string of successful films, including Resurrection (1927), Ramona (1928) and Evangeline (1929). Del R√≠o came to be considered a sort of feminine version of Rudolph Valentino, a \\"female Latin Lover\\", in her years during the American \\"silent\\" era. With the advent of sound, she acted in a range of film genres, from contemporary crime melodramas to musical comedies and romantic dramas. Among her most successful films of that decade include Bird of Paradise (1932), Flying Down to Rio (1933) and Madame Du Barry (1934). In the early 1940s, when her Hollywood career began to decline, Del R√≠o returned to Mexico and joined the Mexican film industry, which at that time was at its peak. When Del R√≠o returned to her native country, she became one of the more important stars of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. A series of Mexican films starring Del Rio, are considered classic masterpieces and helped boost Mexican cinema worldwide. Of them stands out the critically acclaimed Mar√≠a Candelaria (1943). Del R√≠o remained active mainly in Mexican films throughout the 1950s. In 1960 she returned to Hollywood. During the next years she appeared in Mexican and American films. From the late 1950s until the early 1970s she also successfully ventured into theater in Mexico and appeared in some American TV series. Del R√≠o is now considered a mythical figure of American and Mexican cinema, and a quintessential representation of the female face of Mexico in the world.DurangoMas: Dolores del R√≠o biography  Early life   Childhood, family and first marriage (1904‚Äì24) Mar√≠a de los Dolores As√∫nsolo y L√≥pez-Negrete was born in Victoria de Durango, Mexico on August 3, 1904, the daughter of Jesus Leonardo As√∫nsolo Jacques, son of wealthy farmers and director of the Bank of Durango, and Antonia L√≥pez- Negrete, belonging to one of the richest families in the country, whose lineage went back to Spain and the viceregal nobility. Her parents were members of the Mexican aristocracy that existed during the Porfiriato (period in the history of Mexico when the dictator Porfirio D√≠az was the president). On her mother's side, she was a cousin of the filmmaker Julio Bracho and of actors Ram√≥n Novarro (one of the \\"Latin Lovers\\" of the silent cinema) and Andrea Palma (another prominent actress of the Mexican cinema). On her father's side, she was a cousin of the Mexican sculptor Ignacio As√∫nsolo and the social activist Mar√≠a As√∫nsolo. Her family lost all its assets during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1920). Durango aristocratic families were threatened by the insurrection that Pancho Villa was leading in the region. The As√∫nsolo family decided to escape. Dolores's father decided to escape to the United States, while she and her mother fled to Mexico City in a train, disguised as peasants. In 1912, the As√∫nsolo family reunited in Mexico City and lived under the protection of then-president Francisco I. Madero, who was a cousin of Antonia. Dolores attended the Coll√®ge Fran√ßais de Saint-Joseph,colegio franc√©s a college run by French nuns and located in Mexico City. In 1919, a then 15-year-old Dolores saw a performance of the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, whose interpretation influenced her to become a dancer. She confirmed her decision later when she witnessed the performances of Antonia Merc√© \\"La Argentina\\" in Mexico City. She then persuaded her mother to allow her to take dance lessons with the respected teacher Felipita Lopez. However, she suffered from great insecurity and felt like an \\"ugly duckling\\". Her mother commissioned the renowned painter Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez (famous painter of the Mexican aristocracy) to paint a portrait of her daughter. The portrait helped her overcome her insecurities. In 1921, aged 17, Dolores was invited by a group of Mexican women to dance in a party to benefit a local hospital. At this party, she met Jaime Mart√≠nez del R√≠o y Vi√±ent, son of a wealthy family. Jaime had been educated in England and had spent some time in Europe. After a two-month courtship, the couple wed on 11 April 1921. Their honeymoon in Europe lasted two years. Jaime maintained close ties with European aristocratic circles. In Spain Dolores danced again in a charity show for wounded soldiers in the battle of Melilla. The monarchs of Spain, Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie, thanked her deeply and the queen gave her a photograph. In 1924, the couple returned to Mexico. They decided to live on Jaime's ranch in Durango, where cotton was the main crop. But after the cotton market suffered a precipitous fall, the couple was on the verge of ruin. At the same time Dolores discovered she was pregnant. Unfortunately, she suffered a miscarriage and her doctor informed her that she should never again become pregnant, at risk of losing her life. The couple decided to settle in Mexico City.  Career   Film debut and early success (1925‚Äì30)  Publicity photo of Dolores del Rio from Stars of the Photoplay In early 1925, Dolores met the American filmmaker Edwin Carewe, an influential director at the First National studio, who was in Mexico for the wedding of actors Bert Lytell and Claire Windsor. Carewe was fascinated by Dolores and managed to be invited to her home by the artist Adolfo Best Maugard. In the evening Dolores danced and her husband accompanied her on the piano. Carewe was determined to have her, so he invited the couple to work in Hollywood. Carewe convinced Jaime, saying he could turn his wife into a movie star. Jaime thought that this proposal was a response to their economic needs. In Hollywood, he could fulfill his old dream of writing screen plays. Breaking with all the canons of Mexican society at that time and against their family's wishes, they journeyed by train to the United States. Del R√≠o was contracted by Carewe as her agent, manager, producer and director. Her name was shortened to \\"Dolores Del Rio\\" (with an incorrect capital \\"D\\" in the word \\"del\\"). Carewe arranged for wide publicity for her with the intention of transforming her into a star of the order of Rudolph Valentino. As part of an advertising campaign, Carewe made a report dedicated to Dolores in the major magazines in Hollywood: She made her film debut in Joanna (1925), directed by Carewe and released that year. In the film del R√≠o plays the role of Carlotta De Silva, a vamp of Spanish-Brazilian origin, but she appeared for only five minutes. While continuing with his advertising campaign for del R√≠o, Carewe placed her with a secondary role in the film High Steppers (1926), starring Mary Astor. Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal Studios, interested in casting del R√≠o to act in the comedy The Whole Town's Talking (also 1926). These films were not big hits, but helped increase her profile with the movie-going public. Del Rio got her first starring role in the comedy Pals First (1926) also directed by Carewe, a lost film.The Library of Congress/FIAF American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:Pals FirstPals First at Arne Andersen's Lost Film Files:lost 1926 First National films Del R√≠o with Victor McLaglen and Edmund Lowe in What Price Glory? (1926) The film director Raoul Walsh called del R√≠o to cast her in the war film What Price Glory? (1926 again). The film was a commercial success, becoming the second highest-grossing title of the year, grossing nearly $2 million in the United States alone. That same year, thanks to the remarkable progress in her career, she was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars of 1926, along with fellow newcomers Joan Crawford, Mary Astor, Janet Gaynor, Fay Wray and others. Carewe, with the support of the United Artists directed and produced Resurrection (1927), based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy. Del R√≠o was selected as the heroine and Rod La Rocque starred as leading man. Due to the success of the film, Fox quickly began shooting The Loves of Carmen (also 1927), also directed by Raoul Walsh. Fox Film called her to star in the film No Other Woman (1928), directed by Lou Tellegen. Del R√≠o in Ramona (1928) When actress Ren√©e Ador√©e began to show symptoms of tuberculosis, del R√≠o was selected for the lead role of the MGM film The Trail of '98 (also 1928), directed by Clarence Brown. The film was a huge success and brought favorable reviews from critics. Around the same time, she was hired by United Artists for the third film version of the successful novel Ramona (also 1928), directed by Carewe. The success of the film was helped by the same name musical theme, written by L. Wolfe Gilbert and recorded by del R√≠o. Ramona was the first United Artists film with synchronized sound. In late 1928, Hollywood was concerned with the conversion to sound films. On 29 March, at Mary Pickford's bungalow, United Artists brought together Pickford, del R√≠o, Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin, Norma Talmadge, Gloria Swanson, John Barrymore, and D. W. Griffith to speak on the radio show The Dodge Brothers Hour to prove they could meet the challenge of talking movies. Del R√≠o surprised the audience by singing \\"Ramona\\" proving to be an actress with skills for sound cinema. Although her career blossomed, her personal life was turbulent. Her marriage to Jaime Mart√≠nez ended in 1928. The differences between the couple emerged after settling in Hollywood. In Mexico she had been the wife of Jaime Martinez del Rio, but in Hollywood Jaime became husband of a movie star. The trauma of a miscarriage added to the marital difficulties and del R√≠o was advised not to have children. After a brief separation, Dolores filed for divorce. Six months later, she received news that Jaime had died in Germany. As if this were not enough, Del R√≠o had to suffer incessant harassment from her discoverer, Edwin Carewe, who did not cease in his attempt to conquer her. Del Rio made her third film with Raoul Walsh, The Red Dance (1928). Her next project was Evangeline (1929) a new production of United Artists also directed by Carewe and inspired by the epic poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The film was accompanied by a theme song written by Al Jolson and Billy Rose and played by del R√≠o. Like Ramona, the film was released with a Vitaphone disc selection of dialogue, music and sound effects.Evangeline (Broadway at the Park Theatre) , IBDb.com; accessed 19 July 2016. Edwin Carewe had ambitions to marry del R√≠o, with the intent that they become a famous Hollywood couple. Carewe prepared his divorce from his wife Mary Atkin and seeded false rumors in campaigns of his films. But during the filming of Evangeline, United Artists convinced del R√≠o to separate herself artistically and professionally from Carewe, who still held an exclusive contract with the actress. In New York, following the successful premiere of Evangeline, del R√≠o declared to the reporters: \\"Mr. Carewe and I are just friends and companions in the art of the cinema. I will not marry Mr. Carewe.\\" Eventually, she canceled her contract with him. Furious, Carewe filed criminal charges against Dolores. Advised by United Artists lawyers, Dolores reached an agreement with Carewe out of court. In spite of this settlement, Carewe started a campaign against her. In order to eclipse her, he filmed a new sound version of Resurrection starring Lupe V√©lez, another popular Mexican film star and alleged rival of del R√≠o. Having finally broken off professionally from Carewe, del R√≠o was prepared for the filming of her first talkie: The Bad One, directed by George Fitzmaurice. The film was released in June 1930 with great success. Critics said that del R√≠o could speak and sing in English with a charming accent. She was a suitable star for the talkies.  Transition to sound and second marriage (1930‚Äì43)  Promotion photo: Dolores del Rio with Everett Marshall in I Live for Love, 1935. Dolores del Rio wears an Orry-Kelly gown. In 1930, del R√≠o met Cedric Gibbons, an art director at Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer and one of the most influential men in Hollywood, at a party at Hearst Castle. The couple began a romance and finally married on August 6, 1930. The del Rio-Gibbons were one of the most famous couples of Hollywood in the early thirties. They organized 'Sunday brunches' in their Art Deco house at 757 Kingman Avenue in Pacific Palisades. Gibbons designed the interiors of the house. Shortly after her marriage, del R√≠o fell seriously ill with a severe kidney infection. The doctors recommended long bed rest. When she regained her health, she was hired exclusively by RKO Pictures. Her first film with the studio was Girl of the Rio (1931), directed by Herbert Brenon. Del R√≠o in Bird of Paradise (1932) Producer David O. Selznick called the filmmaker King Vidor and said: \\"I want del R√≠o and Joel McCrea in a love story in the South Seas. I didn't have much of a story for the film, but be sure that it ends with the young beauty jumping into a volcano.\\" Bird of Paradise (1932) was shot in Hawaii and del R√≠o became a beautiful native. The film premiered on 13 September 1932 in New York, earning rave reviews. Bird of Paradise created a scandal when released due to a scene featuring del R√≠o and McCrea swimming naked. This film was made before the Production Code was strictly enforced, so some degree of nudity in American movies was not unknown. Del R√≠o with Fred Astaire in Flying Down to Rio (1933) As RKO got the result they expected, they quickly decided to have del Rio do another film, a musical comedy directed by Thornton Freeland: Flying Down to Rio (1933). In the film Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers first appeared as dance partners. It featured del R√≠o opposite Fred Astaire in an intricate dance number called Orchids in the Moonlight. In this film, Del Rio became the first major actress to wear a two-piece women's bathing suit onscreen. But after the premiere, RKO were worried about their economic problems and decided not to renew del R√≠o's contract. Jack Warner offered her a starring role in two films for Warner Bros. The first was the musical comedy Wonder Bar (1934), directed by Lloyd Bacon. Busby Berkeley was the choreographer and Al Jolson her co-star. Del R√≠o and Jolson were gradually stealing the show. Del R√≠o's character grew, while the character of Kay Francis, the other female star of the film, was reduced. The film was released in March 1934 and was a success for Warners. Del R√≠o portraying Madame du Barry in Madame Du Barry (1934) Warner began filming Madame Du Barry (also 1934) with del R√≠o as star and William Dieterle as director. Dieterle focused on her beauty with the help of an extraordinary cloakroom designed by Orry Kelly (considered one of the most beautiful and expensive at the time). But Madame Du Barry was a major cause of dispute between the studio and the Hays Code office, primarily because it presented the court of Louis XV as a sex farce centered around del Rio. The film was severely mutilated by censorship and was not the success which had been anticipated. Even so, the film is considered one of the most popular del R√≠o's films in her period in Hollywood cinema. In the same year, del R√≠o, along with Ram√≥n Novarro and Lupe V√©lez, attended a special screening of the Mexican film ¬°Que Viva M√©xico!. The film was directed by Sergei Eisenstein, and was accused of promoting Communism in California with nationalist sentiment and socialist overtones. It was the first time that del R√≠o was accused of being a communist in the United States, a circumstance that would eventually have consequences in her career in the American film industry. Warner called her again to star in another musical comedy called In Caliente (also 1935), where she plays a sultry Mexican dancer who has an affair with the character played by Pat O'Brien. Around the same time, she starred in I Live for Love (also 1935), with Busby Berkeley as a director. The film contained dance numbers and Berkeley focused on her glamour with a sophisticated wardrobe. The last film she made with Warners was The Widow from Monte Carlo (1936), which went unnoticed. International Settlement (1938) With the support of Universal Studios, del R√≠o filmed The Devil's Playground (1937) opposite Chester Morris and Richard Dix. However, despite the popularity of the three stars, the film was a failure. In 1938, she signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to star in two films with George Sanders. In both films, Lancer Spy (1937) and International Settlement (1938), del R√≠o plays the role of a seductive spy. Both films were box-office failures. Del R√≠o in The Man from Dakota (1940) Cedric Gibbons used his influence with MGM and gained for del R√≠o the main female role in the film The Man from Dakota (1940). But despite his position at the studio, Gibbons could never help his wife in his place of work, where the leading figures were Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford and Jean Harlow. Studio executives admired del R√≠o's beauty, but her career did not interest them at a time when Latin stars had few opportunities to shine at the studio. She was put on a list entitled \\"box office poison\\", (along with stars like Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and others). The list was submitted to Los Angeles newspapers by an independent movie theater whose point was that these stars' high salaries and public prominence did not counteract the low ticket sales for their movies. Amid the decline of her career, in 1940 Dolores met actor and filmmaker Orson Welles at a party organized by Darryl Zanuck. The couple felt a mutual attraction and began a discreet affair, which caused the divorce of del R√≠o and Gibbons. While looking for ways to resume her career, del R√≠o accompanied Orson Welles in his shows across the United States, radio and performances at the Mercury Theatre. She was at his side during the filming and controversy of Citizen Kane (1941). The film, considered a masterpiece today, caused a media scandal by directing open criticism against the media magnate William Randolph Hearst, who began to boycott Welles's projects. Del R√≠o and Joseph Cotten in Journey into Fear (1943) At the beginning of 1942, she began work on Journey into Fear (1943) with Norman Foster as director and Welles as producer. Her relationship with Welles, in the midst of the Citizen Kane scandal, somehow affected her, as her character was drastically reduced in the film. Nelson Rockefeller, in charge of the Good Neighbor policy (and also associated with RKO through his family investments), hired Welles to visit South America as an ambassador of goodwill to counter fascist propaganda about Americans. Welles left the film four days later and traveled to Rio de Janeiro on his goodwill tour. Welles, involved in filming the carnival in Rio de Janeiro, behaved promiscuously, and the news came soon to the United States. Offended and outraged, del R√≠o decided to end her relationship with Welles through a telegram that he never answered. Weeks later, her father died in Mexico. Amid these personal and professional crises, she decided to return to Mexico, commenting:  Return to Mexico and continued success (1943‚Äì59)  She had been sought by Mexican film directors since the late 1930s, but economic circumstances were not favorable for the entry of del R√≠o to the Mexican cinema. She was a friend of Mexican artists (such as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo), and maintained ties with Mexican society and cinema. After breaking off her relationship with Welles, del R√≠o returned to Mexico. As soon as she returned to her country, Mexican director Emilio \\"El Indio\\" Fern√°ndez invited her to film Flor silvestre (1943). Fernandez was her great admirer and he was eager to direct her. This was del R√≠o's first Spanish-language film. The film gathers a successful film crew consisting of Fernandez, the cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, the screenwriter Mauricio Magdaleno and del R√≠o and Pedro Armendariz as the stars. Subsequently, they filmed Mar√≠a Candelaria, the first Mexican film to be screened at the Cannes International Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix (now known as the Palme d'Or) becoming the first Latin American film to do so.Festival de Cannes ‚Äì Official Selection 1946 Fern√°ndez has said that he wrote an original version of the plot on 13 napkins while sitting in a restaurant. He was anxious because he was in love with del R√≠o and could not afford to buy her a birthday present. Her third film with Fern√°ndez Las Abandonadas (1944), was a then controversial film where del R√≠o plays a woman who gives up her son and falls into the world of prostitution. She won the Silver Ariel (Mexican Academy Award) as best actress for her role in the film. Bugambilia (1944) was her fourth movie directed by Fern√°ndez. As del Rio did not correspond to the director's love advances, Bugambilia filming became a torture for both and for the rest of the team, who had to endure the mood swings of the director and the constant threats of del R√≠o leaving the film. When the film was completed in January 1945, del R√≠o announced that she would never again work with \\"El Indio\\" Fern√°ndez. Del R√≠o filmed La selva de fuego (1945) directed by Fernando de Fuentes. The script of this film came to her in error, because of a confused messaging. The film had been specially created for Mar√≠a F√©lix, another Mexican movie star of the day. F√©lix meanwhile, received the script for Dizziness (1946), a film originally created for del R√≠o. When the two stars realized the mistake they refused to return the scripts. Del R√≠o was fascinated by playing a different character which also involved her in daring scenes with the Mexican actor Arturo de C√≥rdova. From this time the press began speculating a strong rivalry between del R√≠o and Felix. Del R√≠o plays twin sisters in the film La Otra (1946), under Roberto Gavald√≥n's direction. It inspired the movie Dead Ringer (1964), starring Bette Davis). Del R√≠o by Annemarie Heinrich, c. 1948 In the film The Fugitive (1947), del R√≠o plays an indigenous woman who helps a fugitive priest (Henry Fonda). She was invited by the film director John Ford to play the role in an adaptation of the novel The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene. Emilio Fern√°ndez also served as associate producer and Gabriel Figueroa was the cinematographer. The movie was filmed in Mexico. in the same period, she traveled to Argentina to film Story of a Bad Woman (Historia de una mala mujer, 1948), a film adaptation of the Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, directed by Luis Saslavsky. Del R√≠o accept worked again with Emilio Fern√°ndez and her film team in the film La Malquerida (1949). The film is based on the novel of the Spanish writer Jacinto Benavente. Del R√≠o gained good notices for her portrayal of Raymunda, a woman confronted by her own daughter for the love of a man. The role of her daughter was played by actress Columba Dominguez. Del R√≠o was directed again by Roberto Gavald√≥n in two films: The Little House (La casa chica, 1950) and Desired (Deseada, 1951). That same year, del R√≠o's cousin, activist Maria As√∫nsolo, asked her to sign a document for a \\"conference for the world peace\\". Del R√≠o never imagined that said document would point her out again as a supporter of international communism. On this year she also met the American millionaire Lewis A. Riley in Acapulco. Riley was known in the middle of Hollywood cinema in the forties for being a member of the Hollywood Canteen, an organization created by movie stars to support relief efforts in World War II. At that time Riley was engaged in a torrid affair with Bette Davis. Del Rio and Riley started a romance. Del R√≠o starred in Do√±a Perfecta (1951), based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos. For this work she won her second Silver Ariel Award for Best Actress. Gavald√≥n directed her again in the film El Ni√±o y la Niebla (1953). Her portrayal of an overprotective mother with a mental instability attracted critical acclaim and she was honored with her third Silver Ariel Award. In 1954, del R√≠o was slated to appear as the wife of Spencer Tracy's character in the 20th Century Fox film Broken Lance. The U.S. government denied her permission to work in the United States, accusing her of being sympathetic to international communism. The document signed by her cheering for world peace, as well as her links with figures openly communist (as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were) and her past relationship with Orson Welles, had been interpreted in the United States as sympathy with communism. She was replaced in the film by Katy Jurado. She reacted by sending a letter to the U.S. government, stating: While her situation was being remedied in the United States, del R√≠o accepted the proposal of filming in Spain another adaptation of a novel by Benavente, Se√±ora Ama (1955), directed by her cousin, the filmmaker Julio Bracho. Unfortunately the prevailing censorship in the Spanish cinema caused the film to be seriously truncated during editing. In 1956, her political situation in the United States was resolved. She began to listen with interest to theatrical offerings. Del R√≠o was already thinking that the play Anastacia of Marcelle Maurette, would be a good choice for her debut. To prepare for this new facet of her career, she engaged the services of Stella Adler as her acting coach. Del R√≠o debuted successfully at the theater on the Falmouth Playhouse in Massachusetts on July 6, 1956 and to continue with a tour of seven other theaters throughout New England. She took advantage of her return to the United States and granted an interview to Louella Parsons to make clear her political position: \\"In Mexico we are worried and fighting against communism.\\" In 1957, she was selected as vice president of the jury of the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. She was the first woman to sit on the jury. Mexican filmmaker Ismael Rodr√≠guez brought del R√≠o and Mar√≠a F√©lix together in the film La Cucaracha (1959). The meeting of the two actresses, considered the main female stars of Mexican cinema, was a success at the box office. This same year, she married Lewis Riley in New York after ten years of relationship. They remained together until her death in 1983.  Final roles and return to Hollywood (1960‚Äì78)  Del R√≠o with Elvis Presley in Flaming Star (1960) In 1957, she debuted in television in the role of a Spanish lady in the American television series Schlitz Playhouse of Stars, with Cesar Romero. Del R√≠o and her husband founded their own production company called Producciones Visuales. and they produced numerous theater projects featuring del R√≠o. Mexican writer Salvador Novo became the translator of her plays. Her first production in Mexico City was Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, which she had made as a film in Argentina a decade earlier. She toured Mexico in the play, an enterprise that was both financially and critically successful, and she later took it to Buenos Aires. Others of her successful theater projects were The Road to Rome (1958), Ghosts (1962), Dear Liar: A Comedy of Letters (1963), La Voyante (1964), The Queen and the Rebels (1967) and The Lady of the Camellias (1968). Del R√≠o returned to Hollywood after 18 years. She was hired by Fox to play the role of the mother of Elvis Presley's character in the film Flaming Star (1960), directed by Don Siegel. Del R√≠o in Cheyenne Autumn (1964) She appeared in John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn released in 1964. Her last Mexican film, Casa de Mujeres (1967). Around the same time, the Italian filmmaker Francesco Rosi invited her to be part of the movie More Than a Miracle (also 1967) with Sophia Loren and Omar Sharif. She played Sharif's character's mother. She also appeared in the TV shows The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (1960), the TV movie The Man Who Bought Paradise (1965), I Spy and Branded (1966). In 1968, del R√≠o first performed on Mexican television in an autobiographical documentary narrated by her. Her last appearance on television was in a 1970 episode of Marcus Welby, M.D.. Del Rio's last film appearance was in The Children of Sanchez (1978), directed by Hall Bartlett and starring Anthony Quinn. She made a brief appearance playing the grandmother.  Death  Del R√≠o's grave at Pante√≥n de Dolores in Mexico City In 1978, she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis, and in 1981 she was diagnosed with hepatitis B following a contaminated injection of vitamins. She also suffered from arthritis. In 1982, del R√≠o was admitted to Scripps Hospital, La Jolla, California, where hepatitis led to cirrhosis. On April 11, 1983, Dolores del R√≠o died from liver failure at the age of 78, in Newport Beach, California. It is said that the day she died, an invitation to attend the Oscars was sent to her. After dying, she was cremated and her ashes were moved from the United States to Mexico where they were buried at the Pante√≥n de Dolores in Mexico City, Mexico, specifically on The Rotunda of Illustrious Persons.  Personal life   Public image and personality  A publicity photo of Dolores del R√≠o taken in 1961. Del R√≠o always projected a special elegance with her beauty, more than just a \\"Latin bombshell\\" such as other actresses like Lupe V√©lez. Del Rio's intrinsic elegance was apparent even off-screen. Del R√≠o strongly identified with her Mexican heritage despite her growing fame and her transition to \\"modernity\\". She also felt strongly about being able to play Mexican roles and bemoaned the fact that she was not cast in them. She never relinquished her Mexican citizenship and said in 1929 (at the height of her popularity) that she wanted \\"to play a Mexican woman and show what life in Mexico really is. No one has shown the artistic side ‚Äì nor the social\\". Del R√≠o was considered one of the prototypes of female beauty in the 1930s. In 1933, the American film magazine Photoplay conducted a search for \\"the most perfect female figure in Hollywood\\", using the criteria of doctors, artists and designers as judges. The \\"unanimous choice\\" of these selective arbiters of female beauty was Del R√≠o. The question posed by the search for the magazine and the methodology used to find \\"the most perfect female figure\\" reveal a series of parameters that define femininity and feminine beauty at that particular moment in the US history. Larry Carr (author of the book More Fabulous Faces) said Del R√≠o's appearance in the early 1930s influenced Hollywood. Women imitated her style of dress and makeup. A new kind of beauty occurred, and Del R√≠o was the forerunner. She is also considered the pioneer of the two piece swimsuit. According to Austrian-American filmmaker Josef von Sternberg, stars such as Del R√≠o, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Rita Hayworth helped him to define his concept of the glamour in Hollywood. When Del R√≠o returned to Mexico, she radically changed her image. In Hollywood, she had lost ground to the modernity of the faces. In Mexico, she had the enormous fortune that filmmaker Emilio Fern√°ndez emphasized Mexican indigenous features. She did not come to Mexico as the Hollywood \\"Latin bombshell\\" transforming her makeup to highlight her indigenous features. Del R√≠o defined the change that her appearance suffered in her native country: \\"I took off my furs and diamonds, satin shoes and pearl necklaces; all swapped by the shawl and bare feet.\\" Del R√≠o herself commented on her face and image: \\"Take care of your inner beauty, your spiritual beauty, and that will reflect in your face. We have the face we created over the years. Every bad deed, every bad fault will show on your face. God can give us beauty and genes can give us our features, but whether that beauty remains or changes is determined by our thoughts and deeds.\\" In 1952, she was awarded the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award and was called the \\"best-dressed woman in America\\".  Relationships  Commemorative plaque at the house where del R√≠o lived in Coyoacan, Mexico City. The plaque reads: Here lived from 1943 to 1983 Dolores del R√≠o, eminent Mexican actress, national glory Regardless of her marriages at different times in her life, she was romantically linked with actor Errol Flynn, filmmaker John Farrow, writer Erich Maria Remarque, film producer Archibaldo Burns, and actor Tito Junco. Her relationship with Orson Welles (1939‚Äì1943) ended after four years largely due to his infidelities. Rebecca Welles, the daughter of Welles and Rita Hayworth, expressed her desire to travel to Mexico to meet Dolores. In 1954, Dolores received her at her home in Acapulco. After their meeting, Rebecca said: \\"My father considered Dolores the great love of his life. She is a living legend in the history of my family.\\" According to Rebecca, until the end of his life, Welles felt for del R√≠o a kind of obsession. Del R√≠o with Orson Welles in 1940. Mexican filmmaker Emilio Fern√°ndez was one her admirers. He said that he had appeared as an extra in several films of Dolores in Hollywood just to be near her. The beauty and elegance of del R√≠o had impressed him deeply. Fern√°ndez said: \\"I fell in love with her, but she always ignored me. I adored her... really I adored her.\\" The house of del R√≠o at Coyoac√°n was called \\"La Escondida\\", and she also spent her days in Acapulco. Both homes became a meeting point for personalities like Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Mar√≠a Felix, Merle Oberon, John Wayne, Edgar Neville, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, Nelson Rockefeller, the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, Princess Soraya of Iran and more. There are many anecdotes about her rivalry with Lupe V√©lez. Del R√≠o never understood the quarrel that V√©lez kept with her inquiring to meet her because it hurt to be ridiculed by the Mexican Spitfire. But the prestige of del R√≠o was known and respected, and V√©lez could not ignore this. V√©lez wore spectacular costumes, but never reached del R√≠o's supreme elegance. V√©lez was popular, had many friends and surrendered fans, but never attended the social circle in Hollywood, where del R√≠o was accepted without reservations. V√©lez spoke ill of del R√≠o, but she never mentioned her name in an offensive way. V√©lez evidently resented Del Rio's success during the years in which both met in Hollywood. There was media speculation about a strong rivalry between Del Rio and Mar√≠a F√©lix, another diva of the Mexican Cinema. F√©lix said in her autobiography: \\"With Dolores I don't have any rivalry. On the contrary. We were friends and we always treated each other with great respect. We were completely different. She [was] refined, interesting, soft on the deal, and I'm more energetic, arrogant and bossy\\". F√©lix said in another interview: \\"Dolores del R√≠o was a great lady. She behaved like a princess. A very intelligent and very funny woman. I appreciate her very much and I have great memories of her\\".  Philanthropy and cultural ambassador  American actors Delores Del Rio and Herbert Rawlinson In the late 1950s, she became a main promoter of the Acapulco International Film Review, serving as host on numerous occasions. In 1966, del R√≠o was co-founder of the Society for the Protection of the Artistic Treasures of Mexico with the philanthropist Felipe Garc√≠a Beraza. The society was responsible for protecting buildings, paintings and other works of art and culture in M√©xico. On January 8, 1970, she, in collaboration with other renowned Mexican actresses, founded the union group \\"Rosa Mexicano\\", which provided a day nursery for the children of the members of the Mexican Actor's Guild. Del R√≠o was responsible for various activities to raise funds for the project and she trained in modern teaching techniques. She served as the president from its founding until 1981. After her death, the day nursery adopted the official name of Estancia Infantil Dolores del R√≠o (The Dolores del R√≠o Day Nursery), and today remains in existence. In 1972, she helped found the Cultural Festival Cervantino in Guanajuato. Her deteriorating health led her to cancel two television projects in 1975. The American television series Who'll See the Children? and Mexican telenovela Ven Amigo. In her work in supporting children she became a spokeswoman of the UNICEF in Latin America and records a series of television commercials for the organization. In 1976 she served as president of the jury in the San Sebastian Film Festival. In 1978 the Mexican American Institute of Cultural Relations and the White House gave Dolores a diploma and a silver plaque for her work in cinema as a cultural ambassador of Mexico in the United States. During the ceremony she was remembered as a victim of McCarthyism. At the age of 76, del R√≠o appeared on the stage of the Palace of Fine Arts theater the evening of October 11, 1981 for a tribute at the 25th San Francisco International Film Festival. During the ceremony, filmmakers Francis Ford Coppola, Mervyn LeRoy and George Cukor spoke, with Cukor declaring del Rio the \\"First Lady of American Cinema\\". This was her last known public appearance. In 1982, she was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.  Legacy  A publicity photo of Dolores del R√≠o taken in 1961. Del R√≠o was the first Mexican actress to succeed in Hollywood. The others have been Lupe V√©lez, Katy Jurado, and in recent years Salma Hayek and Lupita Nyong'o. Her career had a great impact on the trajectories of the Latinas in Hollywood who followed her. Stars including Hayek, Jennifer Lopez, Sofia Vergara and Pen√©lope Cruz follow the steps forged by Dolores del R√≠o.  In art and literature  Del R√≠o's portrait by Diego Rivera in the Museum Casa-Estudio Diego Rivera & Frida Kahlo in Mexico City. The physical characteristics of Dolores del R√≠o made her a veneration figure even beyond death. From a young age, del R√≠o had the intelligence to know how to surround herself with personalities of the intellectual environment. The Hollywood myth placed del R√≠o in another area, as she became one of the women related to the renaissance of Mexican culture and customs. The face of Dolores del R√≠o was also the object of veneration for many artists who shaped her image on their canvases. In 1916, when del R√≠o was 11 years old, she was first portrayed by Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, a very popular artist among Mexican high society. In the 1920s, del R√≠o was also embodied in the canvases of Mexican painters Roberto Montenegro and √Ångel Z√°rraga. In 1938, the actress was portrayed by her close friend, the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The portrait was made in New York. It was del R√≠o's favorite portrait and occupied a special place in her home in Mexico. Rivera also captured the image of Dolores in some of his paintings and murals, highlighting La vendedorea de flores, La pollera and La Creacion. In this last mural, located in the Colegio de San Ildefonso, in Mexico City, the actress represents \\"The Justice\\". In 1941, del R√≠o was also portrayed by the famous Mexican muralist Jos√© Clemente Orozco. The portrait was made at the request of Orson Welles. Unfortunately, when the artist painted the portrait he was already losing his sight. del R√≠o said: \\"He painted his tragedy on my face!\\" Although the portrait was not liked by the actress, she had a very important place in her house. Other artists who recorded her image in her paintings were Miguel Covarrubias, Rosa Rolanda, Antonieta Figueroa, Frances Gauner Goshman, Adolfo Best Maugard and John Carroll. In 1970, the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura, the Mexico's Screen Actors Guild, the Humane Society of the Artistic Treasures of Mexico and the Motion Picture Export Association of America paid her a tribute titled Dolores del Rio in the Art in which her main portraits and a sculpture by Francisco Z√∫√±iga were exhibited. In her will, del R√≠o stipulated that all her artworks were donated to the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature of Mexico, for display in various museums in Mexico City, including the National Museum of Art, the Museum of Art Carillo Gil and the Home-Studio of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. Del R√≠o was the model of the statue of Evangeline, the heroine of Longfellow's romantic poem located in St. Martinville, Louisiana. The statue was donated by del R√≠o, who played Evangeline in the 1929 film.Williams, Cecil B. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1964, pp. 155‚Äì56. Poet Salvador Novo wrote her a sonnet and translated all her stage plays. She inspired Jaime Torres Bodet's novel La Estrella de D√≠a (Star of the Day), published in 1933, which chronicles the life of an actress named \\"Piedad\\". Vicente Le√±ero was inspired by del R√≠o to write his book, Se√±ora. Carlos Pellicer also wrote her a poem in 1967. In 1982, del R√≠o and Maria F√©lix were parodied in the novel Orchids in the Moonlight: Mexican Comedy by Carlos Fuentes. Other authors who wrote her poems were Xavier Villaurrutia, Celestino Gorostiza and Pita Amor. Carlos Monsiv√°is and Jorge Ayala Blanco also made her a tribute book on the occasion of the Ibero-American Film Festival of Huelva, in 1983. The book contains an essay by Monsiv√°is entitled Responsibilities of a face. Vicente Le√±ero also pays tribute to the book Se√±ora. After her death, her photo archive was given to the Center for the Study of History of Mexico CARSO by Lewis Riley.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian- speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the Indigenous people of the Saint John River valley and its tributaries, and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first \\"foreign\\" Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States. Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000,000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland. Name The people call themselves W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik after the W…ôlast…ôkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. W…ôlast…ôkw means \\"Beautiful River.\\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik means \\"People of the Beautiful River,\\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John. Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the MiÍûåkmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people, and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people, who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a MiÍûåkmaq word believed to mean \\"He speaks slowly,\\" or differently by which the MiÍûåkmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but is commonly mistranslated to \\"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\\" Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the MiÍûåkmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the MiÍûåkmaq people before the W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Mal√©cite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound. History Maliseet Territory 17th century At the time of European encounter, the W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting. Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Mal√©cite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions where some W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Mal√©cite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu. Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering, and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.  Colonial wars  As both the French and English increased the number of their settlers in North America, their competition grew for control of the fur trade and physical territory. In addition, wars were carried out that reflected war in Europe. The lucrative eastern fur trade faltered with the general unrest, as French and English hostilities concentrated in the region between Qu√©bec and Port-Royal. Increasing sporadic fighting and raiding also took place on the lower Saint John River. In this period, Mal√©cite women took over a larger share of the economic burden and began to farm, raising crops which previously had been grown only south of Mal√©cite territory. Men continued to hunt, though with limited success. They became useful allies to the French as support against the English. For a short period during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Mal√©cite warriors were engaged frequently in armed conflict, becoming virtually a military organization.  18th century  With the gradual cessation of hostilities in the first quarter of the 18th century, and with the beaver supply severely diminished, fur trading declined. There was little possibility for the Maliseet to return to their traditional ways of life. Their style of seasonal, shifting agriculture on the river was curtailed by the encroachment of European settlers. All the while, the land was becoming well known to wealthy elites, who took advantage of the quality hunting and sport-fishing spots scattered throughout the province. They took all the farmland along the Saint John River, which was previously occupied by the Maliseet, displacing many Aboriginal people from more than a million and a half acres of prime land. 19th century The Maliseet practiced some traditional crafts as late as the 19th century, especially building wigwams and birchbark canoes. They had made changes during the previous two centuries while acquiring European metal cutting tools and containers, muskets and alcohol, foods and clothing. In making wood, bark or basketry items, or in guiding, trapping and hunting, the Maliseet identified as engaging in \\"Indian work.\\" The Europeans developed potato farming in Maine and New Brunswick, which created a new market and demand for Maliseet baskets and containers. Other Maliseet worked in pulp mills, construction, nursing, teaching and business. With evidence that many Maliseet suffered widespread hunger and were wandering, government officials established the first Indian reserves at The Brothers, Oromocto, Fredericton, Kingsclear, Woodstock, Tobique, Madawaska (pre-1800s), and Cacouna. Silas Tertius Rand was a linguist missionary who translated some Bible Selections into Maliseet which were published in 1863 and then the Gospel of John in 1870. 20th century The Maliseet of New Brunswick struggled with problems of unemployment and poverty common to Indigenous people elsewhere in Canada, but they have evolved a sophisticated system of decision making and resource allocation, especially at Tobique. They support community enterprises in economic development, scouting and sports. Some are successful in middle and higher education and have important trade and professional standings; individuals and families are prominent in Indigenous and women's rights; and others serve in provincial and federal native organizations, in government and in community development. There were 4659 registered Maliseet in 1996. Culture The customs and language of the Maliseet are very similar to those of the neighbouring Passamaquoddy (Peskotomuhkati). They are also close to those of the Algonquian-speaking MiÍûåkmaq and Penobscot peoples. The W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik differed from the MiÍûåkmaq by pursuing a partial agrarian economy. They also overlapped territory with neighbouring peoples. The W…ôlast…ôkwewiyik and Passamaquoddy languages are similar enough that linguists consider them slightly different dialects of the same language. Typically they are not differentiated for study. Two traditional Maliseet songs, a dance song and a love song, were collected by Natalie Curtis and published in 1907. As transcribed by Curtis, the love song demonstrates a meter cycle of seven bars and switches between major and minor tonality. Many other songs were recorded by anthropologist William H. Mechling, whose wax cylinder recordings of Maliseet songs are held by the Canadian Museum of History.\\"Jeremy Dutcher's Innovative 'Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa' Is Really About the Future\\". Exclaim!, April 16, 2018. Many of these songs were lost to the community, as the pressures to assimilate into mainstream Canadian culture led the Maliseet people to stop passing their songs on to youth; in the 2010s, however, Maliseet musician Jeremy Dutcher undertook a project of listening to the wax cylinder recordings and reviving the songs. His album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa was released in 2018, and won the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.\\"Jeremy Dutcher Wins 2018 Polaris Music Prize\\". Exclaim!, September 17, 2018. Current situation Today, within New Brunswick, there are approximately 7,700 Maliseet with status in the Madawaska, Tobique, Woodstock, Kingsclear, Saint Mary's and Oromocto First Nations. There are also 1700 in the Houlton Band in Maine, and 1200 in the Viger First Nation in Quebec. The Brothers is a reserve made up of two islands in the Kennebecasis River; they are uninhabited but available for hunting and fishing. About 650 native speakers of Maliseet remain, and about 500 of Passamaquoddy, living on both sides of the border between New Brunswick and Maine. Most are older, although some young people have begun studying and preserving the language. An active program of scholarship on the Maliseet- Passamaquoddy language takes place at the Mi'kmaq - Maliseet Institute at the University of New Brunswick, in collaboration with the native speakers. David Francis Sr., a Passamaquoddy elder living in Sipayik, Maine, has been an important resource for the program. The Institute has the goal of helping Native American students master their native languages. The linguist Philip LeSourd has done extensive research on the language. The Houlton Band of Maliseet was invited to take a nonvoting seat in the Maine Legislature, starting with the 126th Legislature in 2013. Henry John Bear a treaty rights educator, tribal lawyer, fisherman and forester, was elected by his people to this seat. There have been centuries of intermarriage between the Maliseet and European colonists and settlers. Surnames associated with Maliseet ancestry include: Denis, Sabattis, Gabriel, Saulis, Atwin, Launi√®re, Athanase, Nicholas, Bri√®re, Bear, Ginnish, Solis, Vaillancourt, Wallace, Paul, Polchies, Tomah, Sappier, Perley, Aubin, Francis, Sacobie, Nash, Meuse.

It imposed a patriarchal idea of descent and identity on peoples who traditionally had matrilineal kinship systems, whereby children belonged to the mother's people and took their social status from her family. Nicholas was instrumental in bringing the case before the United Nations Human Rights Commission and lobbying for the 1985 legislation which reinstated some rights of First Nation women and their children in Canada via Bill C31 (1985).

The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelet count and enlargement of the liver and spleen, and is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow. Manifestations may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders or bone lesions that may be painful, severe neurological complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelet count, and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy. The disease is caused by a recessive mutation in the GBA gene located on chromosome 1 and affects both males and females. About one in 100 people in the United States are carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is one in 450. Gaucher's disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases. It is a form of sphingolipidosis (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids. The disease is named after the French physician Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882. Signs and symptoms * Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly: the size of the spleen can be 1500‚Äì3000 g, as opposed to the normal size of 50‚Äì200 g. Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture. * Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with an increased risk of infection and bleeding). * Cirrhosis of the liver is rare. * Severe pain associated with joints and bones occurs, frequently presenting in hips and knees. * Neurological symptoms occur only in some types of Gaucher's (see below): * Type I: impaired olfaction and cognition * Type II: serious convulsions, hypertonia, intellectual disability, and apnea * Type III: muscle twitches known as myoclonus, convulsions, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia * Parkinson's disease is recognized as being more common in Gaucher's disease patients and their heterozygous carrier relatives. * Osteoporosis: 75% of patients develop visible bony abnormalities due to the accumulated glucosylceramide. A deformity of the distal femur in the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask is commonly described. * Yellowish-brown skin pigmentation Genetics The three types of Gaucher's disease are autosomal recessive. Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers, the chance of the disease is one in four, or 25%, with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of mutations. Each type has been linked to particular mutations. In all, about 80 known GBA gene mutations are grouped into three main types: * Type I (N370S homozygote), the most common, also called the \\"non-neuropathic\\" type occurs mainly in Ashkenazi Jews, at 100 times the occurrence in the general populace. The median age at diagnosis is 28 years of age, and life expectancy is mildly decreased. * Type II (one or two alleles L444P) is characterized by neurological problems in small children. The enzyme is hardly released into the lysosomes. Prognosis is poor: most die before the age of three. * Type III (also one or two copies of L444P, possibly delayed by protective polymorphisms) occurs in Swedish patients from the Norrbotten region. This group develops the disease somewhat later, but most die before their 30th birthday. The Gaucher-causing mutations may have entered the Ashkenazi Jewish gene pool in the early Middle Ages (48‚Äì55 generations ago). Pathophysiology The disease is caused by a defect in housekeeping gene for lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta- glucosidase, , ) on the first chromosome (1q22). The enzyme is a 55.6-kilodalton, 497-amino acid-long protein that catalyses the breakdown of glucocerebroside, a cell membrane constituent of red and white blood cells. In Gaucher disease, the enzyme is unable to function correctly and glucocerebroside accumulates. The macrophages that clear these cells are unable to eliminate the waste product, which accumulates in fibrils, and turn into 'Gaucher cells', which appear on light microscopy to resemble crumpled-up paper. The exact mechanism of neurotoxicity is not understood, but it is thought to involve a reaction to glucosylsphingosine. Different mutations in the GBA (beta-glucosidase) gene determine the remaining activity of the enzyme. In type I, there is some residual activity of the enzyme, accounting for the lack of neuropathology in this type. Although there is some correlation between genotype and phenotype, neither the amount of stored lipids, nor the residual enzyme activity correlates well with disease symptoms. This circumstance has called for alternative explanations accounting for disease symptoms including * jamming of the endo/lysosomal system * ER stress * altered lipid composition of membranes throughout the cell, including the plasma membrane, and consequent changes in the dynamic and signaling properties of the cell membrane * inflammation caused by cytokine secretion as a result of sphingolipid accumulation, and neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine, a neurotoxin Heterozygotes for particular acid beta-glucosidase mutations carry about a five-fold risk of developing Parkinson's disease, making this the most common known genetic risk factor for Parkinson's. Cancer risk may be increased, particularly myeloma. This is thought to be due to accumulation of glucosylceramide and complex glycosphingolipids. The role of inflammatory processes in Gaucher disease is poorly elucidated. However, sphingolipids are known to participate in inflammation and apoptosis, and markers of macrophage activation are elevated in people with Gaucher disease. These markers include angiotensin-converting enzyme, cathepsin S, chitotriosidase, and CCL18 in the blood plasma; and tumor necrosis factor alpha in splenic Gaucher cells (engorged macrophages). Diagnosis Micrograph showing crinkled paper macrophages in the marrow space in a case of Gaucher disease, H&E; stain. Gaucher disease is suggested based on the overall clinical picture. Initial laboratory testing may include enzyme testing. As a result, lower than 15% of mean normal activity is considered to be diagnostic. Decreased enzyme levels will often be confirmed by genetic testing. Numerous different mutations occur; sequencing of the beta-glucosidase gene is sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is available and is useful when a known genetic risk factor is present. A diagnosis can also be implied by biochemical abnormalities such as high alkaline phosphatase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and immunoglobulin levels, or by cell analysis showing \\"crinkled paper\\" cytoplasm and glycolipid-laden macrophages. Some lysosomal enzymes are elevated, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase, and a human chitinase, chitotriosidase. This latter enzyme has proved to be very useful for monitoring Gaucher's disease activity in response to treatment, and may reflect the severity of the disease Classification Gaucher's disease (GD) has four common clinical subtypes. These subtypes have come under some criticism for not taking account of the full spectrum of observable symptoms (the phenotypes ). Also, compound heterozygous variations occur which considerably increase the complexity of predicting disease course. GD type I (non-neuropathic) is the most common and least severe form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together hepatosplenomegaly) are common; the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically, but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients. GD type II (acute infantile neuropathic) typically begins within 6 months of birth and has an incidence rate around one 1 in 100,000 live births. Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, extensive and progressive brain damage, eye movement disorders, spasticity, seizures, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow. Affected children usually die by age two. GD type III (chronic neuropathic) can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood, and occurs in about one in 100,000 live births. It is characterized by slowly progressive, but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or type II version. Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, blood disorders including anemia, and respiratory problems. Patients often live into their early teen years and adulthood. Treatment For those with type-I and most type-III, enzyme replacement treatment with intravenous recombinant glucocerebrosidase can decrease liver and spleen size, reduce skeletal abnormalities, and reverse other manifestations. This treatment costs about US$200,000 annually for a single person and should be continued for life. The rarity of the disease means dose-finding studies have been difficult to conduct, so controversy remains over the optimal dose and dosing frequency. Due to the low incidence, this has become an orphan drug in many countries, meaning a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population. The first drug for Gaucher's was alglucerase (Ceredase), which was a version of glucocerebrosidase that was harvested from human placental tissue and then modified with enzymes.

Eliglustat (Cerdelga) (approved in 2014) is also a small molecule. The compound is believed to work by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase. Epidemiology The National Gaucher Foundation (United States) states the incidence of Gaucher's disease is about one in 20,000 live births.Gaucher Disease at National Gaucher Foundation. Retrieved June 2012 Around one in 100 people in the general US population is a carrier for type I Gaucher's disease, giving a prevalence of one in 40,000. Among Ashkenazi Jews, the rate of carriers is considerably higher, at roughly one in 15. Type II Gaucher's disease shows no particular preference for any ethnic group. Type III Gaucher's disease is especially common in the population of the northern Swedish region of Norrbotten, where the incidence of the disease is one in 50,000. History The disease was first recognized by the French doctor Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882 and lent his name to the condition. In 1902, its mode of inheritance was discovered by Nathan Brill. The neuronal damage associated with the disease was discovered in the 1920s, and the biochemical basis for the disease was elucidated in the 1960s by Roscoe Brady. The first effective treatment for the disease, the drug alglucerase (Ceredase), was approved by the FDA in April 1991. An improved drug, imiglucerase (Cerezyme), was approved by the FDA in May 1994 and has replaced the use of Ceredase. October is National Gaucher's Disease Awareness Month in the United States.

Life and work Russell was born in Guildford, Surrey, the son of John Russell Snr., book and print seller and four times mayor of the town; his father was something of an artist, and drew and published two views of Guildford. Russell was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and soon showed a strong inclination for art. He trained under Francis Cotes RA (of Cavendish Square, London), one of the pioneers of English pastel painting, and, like Cotes, was an admirer of the pastel drawings of Rosalba Carriera whose methods influenced his technique of \\"sweetening\\". At the age of 19 he converted to Methodism, which was the cause of tension with his family and with his teacher; he made no secret of his strong evangelical leanings and would attempt to preach and convert at every opportunity. Russell set up his own studio, in London, in 1767. He made the acquaintance of the notorious Dr. William Dodd, whose portrait he painted in 1768.Portrait of William Dodd. npg.org.uk He was introduced to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to give up painting and attend her Methodist ministers' training college at Trevecca in Wales. On 5 February 1770, he married Hannah Faden, daughter of a Charing Cross print and map seller, whom he had converted. They lived at No. 7 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, where he had moved in 1770. Russell's work caused him to travel extensively around Britain. In 1772, he wrote Elements of Painting with Crayons, by which time he had won premiums for his drawings from the Society of Arts in 1759 and 1760, and entered the Royal Academy school of art in 1770, winning its gold medal for figure drawing the same year. He exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1768 and showed 330 works at the Academy between 1769 until and his death. Portrait of George Whitefield In 1770, Russell painted Methodist minister, George Whitefield (engraved by James Watson) and the future philanthropist, William Wilberforce, then only eleven years old.William Wilberforce. npg.org.uk In 1771, he exhibited a portrait in oils of Charles Wesley at the Royal Academy and, in 1772, painted Selina, Countess of Huntingdon in pastel.Countess of Huntingdon (engraving). npg.org.uk This was a symbolic picture, and was lost on its voyage out; but it was engraved, and he later also painted her in oils. Also in that year he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. The following year, 1773, he painted John Wesley (engraved by Bland). In 1788, after a long wait, Russell was elected a royal academician, in the same year painting a portrait of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. In 1789, he was commissioned to portray the royal physician Francis Willis. The results obviously pleased the monarch as, in 1790, he was appointed Crayon (pastel) Painter to King George III, Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales (both of whom Russell also painted) and the Duke of York. With such royal patronage, he developed a large and fashionable clientele. The Face of the Moon (1793‚Äì1797), Russell's pastel drawing of a gibbous moon. \\"He showed the moon at seventeen or eighteen days, but in doing so added an oblique ‚Äì and impossible ‚Äì source of illumination. Under the resulting raking light all the variations of the moon's surface are thrown into greater relief.\\" Russell was a man of deep religious beliefs, a devout follower of George Whitefield. He began an elaborate introspective diary in John Byrom's shorthand in 1766 and continued it to the time of his death. In it, he recorded his own mental condition and religious exercises, and occasionally information concerning his sitters. Though his religion appears to have become less militant after his marriage, his diary bears witness to his anxiety with regard to his spiritual welfare. Not only would he not work on Sunday, but he would allow no one to enter his painting-room. He was afraid to go out to dinner on account of the loose and blasphemous conversation which he might hear. He was on good terms with Sir Joshua Reynolds, with whom he dined at the academy, the Dilettanti Society, and the Literary Club (now The Club), but he records that on these or other festive occasions he always left early. He was troubled by ill-health for much of his life, and in 1803 became almost deaf following a bout of cholera. He died in Hull in 1806 after contracting typhus. Russell's work can be viewed at many galleries in the UK and around the world, but the largest collection is held by Guildford House Art Gallery in Guildford. Many of his portraits were engraved by, amongst others, Joseph Collyer, Charles Turner, James Heath, Dean, Bartolozzi and Trotter. Astronomy Russell was interested in astronomy and made, with the assistance of his daughter, a lunar map, which he engraved on two plates which formed a globe showing the visible surface of the Moon ‚Äì it took twenty years to finish. He also invented an apparatus for exhibiting the phenomena of the Moon, which he called \\"Selenographia\\". Russell's large and highly detailed pastel drawing of The Face of the Moon (1793‚Äì1797) is \\"the most faithful early representation of the lunar sphere\\". Some of his best portraits were of the era's acclaimed scientists, such as his friend William Herschel, who he depicted holding a stellar chart showing his discovery of Uranus. It was Herschel who provided the powerful telescope that Russell used for his painstaking lunar observations. Family Of his twelve children (of which four died in infancy), William Russell (1780‚Äì1870), exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1809. The National Portrait Gallery contains a portrait of Judge Sir John Bailey by him.Portraits by William Russell (National Portrait Gallery, London). He was ordained in 1809, and gave up painting. He was forty years rector of Shepperton, Middlesex, and died on 14 September 1870.

Background The first decades of the 20th century saw marked economic and social change in Brazil. With manufacturing on the rise, the central government ‚Äî dominated by the coffee oligarchs and the old order of caf√© com leite and coronelismo ‚Äî came under threat from the political aspirations of new urban groups: professionals, government and white-collar workers, merchants, bankers, and industrialists. In parallel, growing prosperity encouraged a rapid rise of a new working class of Southern and Eastern European immigrants who contributed to the growth of trade unionism, anarchism, and socialism.Brazil: Poppino, Rollie E.; the Land and People: The Land and the People 2nd edition p. 253; Oxford University Press, 1973 ASIN B001P7H4M4 In the post-World War I period, Brazil saw its first wave of general strikes and the establishment of the Communist Party in 1922.Ameringer, Charles D.; Political Parties of the Americas, 1980s to 1990s: Canada, Latin America, and the West Indies p. 123; Greenwood Publishing Group, 1992 A new class of army junior officers () had emerged who were trained to European standards and believed themselves superior to their senior officers. In addition, various senior officers had become identified with the government and political structure, a source of criticism from the tenentes.McCann, Frank D.; Soldiers of the P√°tria: A History of the Brazilian Army, 1889‚Äì1937 p. 261; Stanford University Press, 2004; Meanwhile, the divergence of interests between the coffee oligarchs and the burgeoning, dynamic urban sectors was intensifying. According to Latin American historian Benjamin Keen, the task of transforming society \\"fell to the rapidly growing urban bourgeois groups, and especially to the middle class, which began to voice even more strongly its discontent with the rule of the corrupt rural oligarchies\\". In contrast, despite a wave of general strikes in the post-war years, the labour movement remained small and weak, lacking ties to the peasantry, who constituted the overwhelming majority of the Brazilian population. As a result, rather disparate and disjointed social reform movements cropped up in the 1920s. July 1922: the first revolt The Copacabana Fort garrison in 1922What became known as the tenente movement came to public notice on 5 July 1922 when a group of young Brazilian Army officers began a rebellion against the Old Republic at Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. Sparked initially by the punishment and brief imprisonment of Marshal Hermes da Fonseca by President Epit√°cio Pessoa, the tenentes attempted to prevent Artur da Silva Bernardes (1875-1955) from assuming the presidential office. Tenentes demanded various forms of social modernization, calling for agrarian reform, the formation of co-operatives, and the nationalization of mines. 6 July 1922: The '18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt' on their way to confront army loyalistsTheir early- morning rebellion was taken up by a garrison in S√£o Paulo but not by others; only \\"scattered units around Rio de Janeiro revolted: the Escola Militar, some elements of the First Infantry Regiment and the Battalion of Engineers, and the garrisons of Forts Copacabana and Vigia. However, the remainder of the First Army Division stayed loyal and, with General Setembrino de Carvalho supervising the operations, easily crushed the revolt\\". Twenty-four hours later, just 200 rebels remained when the navy dreadnought Minas Geraes shelled the Copacabana barracks, after which two navy aircraft bombed the barracks in the first use of naval aircraft in combat in Latin America.Scheina, Robert L., Latin America: A Naval History 1810‚Äì1987, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1987, , p. 195. The defenders were driven from their positions. A group known subsequently as the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt were led down Avenida Atl√¢ntica by Ant√¥nio de Siqueira Campos and Eduardo Gomes to confront the army loyalists; the eighteen made a last stand on the beach, where sixteen were killed and two, Gomes and de Siqueira Campos, survived. In the aftermath, the government imposed a state of emergency, 1,000 cadets were expelled from the army school and many officers posted to remote garrisons.Scheina, Robert L.; Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Professional Soldier, 1900‚Äì2001 p. 128; Brassey's, 2003 Paulista Revolt 1924 The Revolta Paulista of 1924 was the second tenentista revolt and the biggest conflict of the city of S√£o Paulo. It began in the early hours of July 5 and ended on July 28, 1924. The revolt was motivated by the discontent of the military with the economic crisis and the concentration of power at the hands of politicians from S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais. Commanded by retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with the participation of several lieutenants, the main objective of the uprising was to depose President Artur Bernardes (considered enemy of the military since the crisis of the false letters). Among the claims was secret ballot, free justice and the introduction of compulsory public education. Raised in the capital of S√£o Paulo on July 5, 1924 (the 2nd anniversary of the 18 Revolt of the Copacabana Fortress, the first tenentista revolt), the revolt occupied the city for 23 days, forcing the president of the state, Carlos de Campos, to flee to the city. district of the Penha, in the east zone of S√£o Paulo, on July 9, after having been bombarded the Palace of the Champs Elys√©es, seat of the S√£o Paulo government at that time. Carlos de Campos was installed in an adapted car at the Guaia√∫na station in Central Brazil, where the federal troops were from Mogi das Cruzes. In the interior of the state of S√£o Paulo happened rebellions in several cities, with seizure of prefectures. The city of S√£o Paulo was bombed by Federal Government aircraft. The loyalist Army (loyal to President Artur Bernardes) used the so-called \\"terrifying bombardment\\", reaching various parts of the city, especially working-class neighborhoods such as Mooca and Br√°s, and the middle class, such as Perdizes. Without military equivalent (artillery or aviation) to confront legalistic troops, the rebels retired to Bauru in the early hours of July 28, where Isidoro Dias Lopes heard news that the legalist army was concentrated in the city of Tr√™s Lagoas, Mato Grosso do Sul. At 10 o'clock on the morning of July 28, Carlos de Campos returned to his office in the Government Palace. Isidoro Dias Lopes and Juarez Tavora then planned an attack on that city. The defeat at Tr√™s Lagoas, however, was the greatest defeat of all this revolt. A third of the revolting troops died, were seriously injured, or were captured. Overthrown, the rioters then marched south to Brazil, where, in the city of Foz do Igua√ßu, in Paran√°, they joined Gaucho officers led by Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes, in what became the greatest guerrilla feat in Brazil until then: the Prestes Column. War bonuses used by the revolutionaries of 1924. The final balance indicates the death of 1,000 people, and 4,000 injured, and an estimated 300,000 temporarily driven into the outskirts of the city. July 1924-February 1927: the second revolt and the Long March of the Prestes Column Two years later, on 5 July 1924, another group of army officers mounted a rebellion in S√£o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. The date was chosen to honour the 1922 rebels; the uprising \\"was better prepared and was intended to bring down the Bernardes government\\". The formal leader was retired General Isidoro Dias Lopes, with others including Eduardo Gomes, Newton Estillac Leal, Jo√£o Cabanas and Miguel Costa. The rebellion began well, with control of S√£o Paulo being secured after the governor and forces loyal to him abandoned the city early on 9 July. The rebels in the city were put under siege by government forces, and prevented from linking up with other uprisings which were breaking out in places such as Bela Vista, Mato Grosso, Aracaju, Sergipe and Manaus. The city was then subjected to a several-week artillery and aerial bombardment, of which civilians bore the brunt. On 26 July, army aircraft dropped leaflets over the city warning the remaining civilians to leave so that loyalist forces would have a free hand against the rebels. \\"Isidoro's various attempts at securing an accord with the government that would at least give the rebels amnesty were rebuffed. The leaders understood that they would be wiped out, along with a good part of the city, if they stayed. On the night of 27 July they staged a careful withdrawal of 3,000 troops on thirteen trains, via the Northwest Railroad, toward Mato Grosso, where they hoped to hook up with sympathetic units\\". This withdrawal was executed so smoothly that it went unnoticed by the government forces until the morning. However, with their route to Mato Grosso blocked, the rebels retired to an area bordering Argentina and Paraguay close to Foz do Igua√ßu. Lu√≠s Carlos PrestesHaving escaped into the interior, and joined by others from Rio Grande do Sul, they began a campaign as a guerrilla force led by Lu√≠s Carlos Prestes and Miguel Costa. They became known as the Prestes Column, and covered some 25,000 kilometres from October 1924 to February 1927 \\"as they roamed through the interior of the country seeking unsuccessfully to promote mass rebellion or at any rate to act as a moral gadfly to the nation's conscience\\". After losing significant numbers to desertion and sickness, escaping encirclement at Palmeira, Rio Grande do Sul in January 1925, making a successful stand at the Igua√ßu Falls in February and \\"after some initial disagreements about strategy, the rebels adopted one that amounted less to a war of movement than a moving 'armed protest demonstration' that would serve as a constant call to action against the hated Bernardes. The idea was not to defeat the forces sent against them, much less the old objective of seizing power in Rio de Janeiro: the objective now was to stay alive, keep the column moving and seemingly invincible. In that, they succeeded as they moved through state after state from Mato Grosso to Maranh√£o and back, before seeking refuge in Bolivia in 1927\\". Regarding the 'Long March', Prestes subsequently wrote that \\"the tactics of swift marches, evasion as far as possible of contact with superior enemy forces and surprise attacks aimed at demoralizing the enemy and capturing arms and ammunition, demonstrated that in Brazilian conditions it was possible to stage a protracted struggle\\". However, years later he was critical of the futility of his own strategy, writing that \\"I also defended the column's march tactics, claiming that they presented opportunities for recruiting new fighters. This, however, was not the case. The farmers sympathised with us for the simple reason that we were against the oppressors, they admired our heroism and devotion, but had no intention (with rare exceptions of some young people) of committing themselves to a struggle in whose success they could not believe\\". Legacy Plaque commemorating the '18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt'The tenente revolts heralded the end of the politics of caf√© com leite and coronelismo and the beginning of social reforms. The actions and ideas that grew out of the revolts inspired other individuals, such as Get√∫lio Vargas, to lead the 1930 revolution against the Brazilian Government and bring down the Old Republic. The impact of the \\"Prestes Column\\" placed insurgents in contact with the rural peasantry of Brazil and the surrounding counrtyside; a contact that made the soldiers aware for the first time, the wretched conditions of their countrymen . \\"The tenentes became the most visible proponents for revolution and helped convince Vargas that the use of force would be necessary\\". Subsequently, with the help of the tenentes, whom he restored to the army, often with significant promotions, Vargas \\"forged a highly personalised dictatorship\\". Prestes, however, \\"proclaimed his opposition to the 1930 coup and formally applied for membership of the Communist Party\\".

Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as CBN-8 in Orange, and has since expanded to cover regional New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Prime7 along with GWN7 national broadcast facilities are based in Canberra, with playout facilities located at MediaHub (within the Sydney suburb of Ingleburn) Australia. Prime Media Group head office/administration is located in Pyrmont, Sydney. History Origins Prime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks ‚Äì Midstate Television in Orange, Dubbo and Griffith; RVN/AMV in Wagga and Albury; and 9-8 Television in Tamworth and Taree. CBN-8 Orange first aired on 17 March 1962, followed by CWN-6 Dubbo on 1 December 1965. The two stations were both licensed to Country Television Services (also the owner of radio station 2GZ in Orange). CWN was a full-time relay of CBN‚Äîthe first Australian television station to relay another. The two stations thus formed the country's first regional television network. Albury launched on 7 September 1964 while RVN-2 Wagga Wagga began broadcasting on 19 June 1964, and MTN-9 Griffith began on 15 December 1965. The two stations merged in 1971 as the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd with the callsign RVN/AMV on air. In northern New South Wales, NEN-9 Tamworth began transmission on 27 September 1965, with a relay in Armidale (NEN-1, later NEN-10) on 15 July 1966. ECN-8 Taree started on 27 May 1966. At one stage, ECN-8 was tied NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (now owned by WIN Corporation), however the two stations split. NEN later merged with ECN as 9-8 Television. Television 6-8-9 As a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced, MTN-9 joined CWN-6 and CBN-8 to form Television 6-8-9 in 1973. Relays were launched in Portland, Lithgow, Mudgee, Cobar, Kandos and Rylstone and Bathurst. In 1981, 6-8-9 changed its name to Midstate Television. Colour television was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 ‚Äì one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date. The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including tennis and rugby. In 1979, a documentary titled Goin' Down The Road, about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a Logie award for an 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station'. Midstate produced a number of local programs, including the Weekend Report, Early Shift, Rural Roundup and Around the Schools. From 1968, CBN was able to access a Postmaster General's Department microwave link for national news bulletins and major events. Aggregation Kooringal in 2008, now occupied by Generosity Church. Midstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987. It was soon merged with Ramcorp's other stations, RVN/AMV and NEN/ECN. In 1988, Midstate Television was renamed Prime Television and began to show increased Seven Network programming in readiness for aggregation. When aggregation took place, Prime began broadcasting to both southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern New South Wales took place in two stages ‚Äì first the Australian Capital Territory and NSW south coast on 31 March 1989, followed by Orange, Dubbo, and Wagga Wagga on 31 December 1989. These changes led to the de-merger of RVN-AMV, with RVN becoming CBN-2. Griffith remained a one-station market, however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes ‚Äì mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year. Although advertising revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network's expansion ‚Äì an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation. After losses of $50 million, it was not until 1993 that the renamed Prime Television Limited posted a profit. Prime Television became the first commercial network in Australia to add a digital on-screen graphic to the network's broadcasts. Starting in the early 90s, the first watermark consisted of the Prime text from the network's former circle logo, and was located at the top right of the screen. The watermark was updated in 2001 to coincide with Prime's new logo, still shown at the top right of the screen. This continued until Prime Television's relaunch as Prime7 in 2011. The watermark is now seen at the bottom right of the screen, like most TV network watermarks. In November 1996, Prime's parent company, Prime Television Limited, purchased the Golden West Network, a merged group of four stations in regional Western Australia; BTW-3 Bunbury, VEW-8 Kalgoorlie, GTW-11 Geraldton and GSW-9 Albany. Western Australia, similar to Griffith and Mildura, remained a one-station commercial market until 1999 when GWN became a Seven Network affiliate, after WIN Television began transmission as an affiliate of both the Nine Network and Network Ten. The network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997, when a number of licences were purchased from United Christian Broadcasters for an estimated $3.6 million. Prime Television New Zealand began broadcasting on 30 August 1998, with a nightly local news program in both Waikato and Christchurch. Prime also expanded into Argentina with the purchase of the Canal 9 network. 2000s Prime Television Broadcast Centre in Watson, Australian Capital Territory The renamed Argentine network Azul Televisi√≥n was sold for $108 million in early 2000 due to lower-than-expected performance. During the same year, Prime benefited greatly from its affiliation with the Seven Network throughout its carriage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The network's relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s, leading to the introduction of 7onPrime promotional branding for Seven Network-produced programs. Local news bulletins for Newcastle, the Gold Coast, Canberra, and Wollongong were axed in 2001 due to falling ratings and the anticipated costs of the switch to digital television. This, and the closure of a number of news bulletins by Southern Cross Broadcasting, prompted the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the adequacy of regional news services The ABA later mandated that stations broadcast a minimum level of local content, based on a points systemtwo points per minute for local news, and one point per minute for other local content, excluding paid advertisements. Prime formed a partnership with the Nine Network (affiliated in Australia to competitor WIN Television), giving its owner, PBL Media the option to purchase a 50% share of Prime Television New Zealand in return for access to original programming, and cross-promotion in PBL's New Zealand magazine titles. Following this, Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming similar to that of the Nine Network. In November 2005, Prime Television New Zealand was purchased by subscription television provider SKY Network Television for $NZ30 million, completed after approval by New Zealand's Commerce Commission in February 2006. Mildura Digital Television, a digital-only station in Mildura began transmissions in 2006 as a joint venture between Prime Television Limited and WIN Corporation. Section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act allowed for the provision of a third station owned by either one or both existing networks. MDT is a direct relay of Ten Melbourne, albeit with local advertising. Prime Television announced on 21 December 2009 that it would start broadcasting 7TWO on 23 December 2009. 2010s On 25 September 2010, Prime began transmission of the new HD digital channel 7mate aimed at men 16‚Äì49. The first program to be broadcast was the drawn 2010 AFL Grand Final. On 15 January 2011, Prime Media Group reported that Prime and GWN were set to rebrand as Prime7 and GWN7 respectively. Their news bulletins had quickly changed their names to Prime7 News and GWN7 News, while 7TWO dropped the \\"Prime\\" logo on the multichannels. Prime and GWN relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 18:00 (6pm).http://www.prime7.com.au In December 2016, Prime7 transferred its playout facilities to MediaHub Australia located within the Sydney suburb of Ingleburn. The facility is a joint venture between public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation and rival regional network WIN Television. Network officials noted that its existing Canberra facilities cannot be upgraded with technological advancements, causing Prime7 to be incapable of relaunching its HD simulcast as well as introducing 7flix to its viewers. On 3 August 2017, 18 months after launching in metropolitan areas, Prime7 announced that it would carry 7flix to its regional stations in northern and southern New South Wales, regional Victoria and Mildura. The channel became available on digital channel 66 in MPEG-4 format. On 15 January 2018, Prime7 quietly relaunched its primary HD service, Prime7 HD, on digital channel 60 in MPEG-4 format. Programming Prime's programming schedule is almost identical to those of Seven Network metropolitan counterparts ATN in Sydney and HSV in Melbourne, with some differences. Since the Prime network's inception it has featured a broad range of original local programming, currently including children's program Possum's Club with Madelaine Collignon and station mascot Prime Possum as well as community service segment Prime7 InfoNet, a series of short updates listing local community events. Prime7's overnight schedule also differs from the Seven Network feed, containing infomercials from Danoz Direct, Home Shopping, and a feed from pay television channel Expo. Past programming from Prime Television has been recognised nationally, with some local productions winning the Logie Award for 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station'. The network has won Logies for Goin' Down The Road (CBN-8, 1979), Naturally (NEN-9/ECN-8, 1984), Stranded (Prime Television, 1993), Rest in Peace (Prime Television, 1994), and No Time For Frailty (Prime Television, 1996). Prime7 News The current Prime7 News logo Prime7 News is the network's local news service. Full bulletins are produced for the towns and surrounding regions originally covered by the stations \\"Midstate 6,8,9 Television\\", Dubbo/Orange, \\"RVN-2/AMV-4\\", Wagga Wagga/Albury and \\"9/8 Television\\" (NEN-9/ECN-8) Tamworth/Taree, prior to the aggregation of regional television services in New South Wales that occurred in the early 1990s. In other areas two-minute news updates are shown at various times of the day. Prime7 News bulletins are presented from Canberra weeknightly at 18:00 (6pm) in the Albury-Wodonga Border, North West, North Coast, Central West and Wagga Wagga broadcast areas. Prime7 News at 6:30 (with Daniel Gibson) (at 18:30) also comes from the Canberra news centre. Availability Prime7 is available in standard definition digital format. Since June 2007 a 1080i high definition simulcast has also been available, replacing the network's former 576p service. Prime7 is viewed mainly through free-to-air terrestrial transmitters, although subscription cable also provided by TransACT and Neighbourhood Cable in the Australian Capital Territory and Ballarat, respectively. Prime7 broadcasts to southern New South Wales through stations based in Orange and Dubbo, northern New South Wales from stations in Tamworth and Taree, Victoria from its Albury-Wodonga-based station AMV, and Mildura via PTV. Prime7 HD Prime7 HD originally launched on 15 October 2007 as a sister to the Seven Network's high definition simulcast, Seven HD. Then-known as Prime HD, it broadcast in 1080i high definition on digital channel 60 on Prime's regional stations NEN Northern New South Wales, CBN Southern New South Wales, AMV Victoria and PTV Mildura. The channel broadcast breakaway programming from 10 December 2007 until 4 October 2009, when it was turned into a straight HD simulcast. Prime HD fully ceased broadcasting on 25 September 2010 with the launch of the HD channel 7mate. Prime7 re-launched their HD simulcast service, now known as Prime7 HD on 15 January 2018. Logos Prime Television became a network in May 1988, with shared logos produced and used across the regional stations, featuring the word Prime Television either above an outlined triangle or rectangle. Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 March 1989, along with the introduction of a green logo featuring the word Prime with the letter i dotted with a stylised globe, introduced in December 1988. This logo was used on its own across the network until 1996, when a new circular logo was introduced in 1990. Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the Golden West Network. Following the 2011 relaunch, a new red logo was introduced which incorporates the Seven Network logo.

Concept The I-SPY books are a series of around forty small volumes that have sold hundreds of thousands of copies each, totalling sales of 25 million worldwide by 2010. Each book in the I-Spy series covers a different subject, such as I-SPY Cars, I-SPY on the Pavement, I-SPY Churches, I-SPY on a Train Journey, and so on. As children spot the objects listed, they record the event in the book and gain points, varying according to how unusual the sight. In the early years of the series, completed books could be sent to Charles Warrell, (known as Big Chief I-SPY) for a feather and order of merit. The children participating in the game were known as The I-SPY Tribe, and by 1953 the I-SPY Tribe had half a million members. History The company was supposedly run by a Red Indian chief called Big Chief I-Spy. The original Big Chief I-Spy was Charles Warrell, a former headmaster who created I-Spy towards the end of his working life. He retired in 1956, but lived until 1995 when he died at the age of 106. After Warrell's retirement his assistant Arnold Cawthrow became the second Big Chief, and served in this role until 1978. For part of this time he also worked as an antiques dealer in Islington. He died in 1993, and is commemorated by a stone plaque placed on the outside of the Boatmen's Rooms, the house where he spent some of his last years in Deal, Kent. The books were originally self-published in 1948I-SPY SPOTTERBOOKS 1948 series, Easy on the Eye. Retrieved on 4 October 2018. by Charles Warrell but, after a brief period when they were published by the Daily Mail (the initial four being At the Circus, Secret Codes, Dogs and In the Country), they were taken over by the News Chronicle newspaper and based in the paper's building in Bouverie Street.I-SPY (Daily Mail; News Chronicle; Michelin; etc.) - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 4 October 2018. The regular I-SPY column, which appeared in the News Chronicle, reverted to the Daily Mail when the News Chronicle ceased publication in 1960, and continued to appear until the late 1980s. The books have had various publishers over the years including the Dickens Press, a company set up to continue the book publishing interests of the News Chronicle, and Polystyle Publications, a publisher of children's comics. The books became very popular, with print runs well into six figures. Big Chief I-Spy had a succession of assistants, usually known as \\"Hawkeye\\". In the early 1970s, this position was held by Ralph Mills. Earlier assistants included Max Heinz and John Tagholm. In the 1980s, following a short-lived third Big Chief, Robin Tucek, David Bellamy replaced Big Chief I-Spy as the person to whom completed books were sent, and the earlier Red Indian connections were quietly dropped. Michelin Travel Publications acquired and published the series from 1991 until 2002 when they effectively ceased publication, there were ad-hoc sales after that date to clear stocks. The series was relaunched by Michelin in December 2009 with 12 new titles, followed by a further 12 in Spring 2010. The Bookseller announced the launch in October 2009 with an interview with Michelin Commercial Director Ian Murray. Murray confirmed that the initial 12 titles would include I Spy Birds, Cars, Trees, On a Car Journey and On a Train Journey. The new I-Spy titles are faithful to the original concept but are fully updated and include all new colour images. The relaunch of the books and subsequent multiple expansions of the title list suggested that their popularity is being enjoyed by a new generation of children. News Chronicle Series I-Spy 6d Series These followed the same basic format as the early spotter books, as well as keeping the concept of a Big Chief I-Spy, but were issued in a more standard portrait format 4\\" by 5\\" (13cm by 10cm). Pocket sized, with thinner covers, each I-Spy title had fifty pages or so of pen drawings and descriptive text. The Daily Mail dropped their involvement after the previous series, and the new look books were launched in conjunction with News Chronicle around 1951. By 1952 the first six of the new titles were in print, with four more planned. The series was in print until 1966, with older titles refreshed every so often and updated. The News Chronicle was taken over by the Daily Mail in 1960 and closed, but the I-SPY books were by now so popular that the Mail decided to re-associate themselves with the publication once more. The covers were redesigned to remove the News Chronicle name, but the Daily Mail logo was only seen inside the books. Around 1963 even this was removed and the titles were simply published by the Dickens Press (who printed the Mail). With all these changes, up to five distinct editions of some titles exist. *1. At the Seaside *2. On the Farm *3. History *4. On a Train Journey *5. Dogs *6. In the Country *7. At the Zoo ‚Äì Animals *8. At the Zoo ‚Äì Birds and Reptiles *9. In the Street *10. On the Road *11.

Churches I-Spy Colour Series A companion range of 1/- books, the I-Spy Colour Series was the same size and actually had the same number of pages as their 6d cousins, but used better, thicker quality paper and some inside pages in full colour. Launched probably in 1952 with the first two titles, the colour series issued two new titles each year for a while. The colour books were all natural history subjects and the aim seems to have been to emulate similar but more expensive offerings from publishers like Ladybird and Observer's. Eight titles were issued with the News Chronicle name, and only with the last did they move into more familiar I-Spy territory with In The Garden. When the News Chronicle closed, four further colour titles followed under the Dickens Press name. These were new editions of titles which had originally appeared in the 6d black and white series but been discontinued. The last title came out in 1963 and the 12 books were never numbered.

Iglesias Enrique Valent√≠n Iglesias Garc√≠a (born 29 March 1930 in Arancedo, Asturias) is an economist of Uruguayan-Spanish dual citizenship. He was once president of the Inter-American Development Bank, an international institution dedicated to furthering economic development in the Western Hemisphere through investment and policy formulation. He was appointed as Special Adviser for Venezuela to Federica Mogherini, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, on 28 May 2019. Biography Enrique was born in Asturias, Spain, in 1930 to Manuel Iglesias and Isabel Garc√≠a. His parents emigrated to Uruguay in 1934 and Enrique was naturalized as a Uruguayan citizen. By university, Iglesias had established an interest in government and economics; in 1953, he graduated from Uruguay's Universidad de la Rep√∫blica with a degree in economics and business administration. After graduation, he went on to private-sector banking, which led to a term as the president of Uruguay's Central Bank (1967-1969). Iglesias held a variety of influential posts before being elected president of the Inter-American Development Bank in 1988. During Iglesias's first and second terms as president, the IDB concluded negotiations for its Seventh (1989) and Eighth (1994) General Increase in Resources. Respectively, these negotiations increased the Bank's ordinary capital by USD $26.5 billion and $101 billion. Iglesias is an honorary member in The Club of Rome, promoting a one world government. He is also a member of the Fondation Chirac's honour committee,Fondation Chirac's honour committee ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace. Political views and controversy Iglesias is a strong proponent of open markets and multilateralism, with a strong interest in energy reform. Under Iglesias' tenure, the IDB has received criticism about its funding of the project. In a report recently leaked by U.S. Amazon lobby group Amazon Watch, Peru's Ministry of Health found that \\"22 indigenous people died after exposure to respiratory illnesses from gas pipeline workers and 30% of the 500-strong Nanti tribe has died since 1995\\". The subject is especially delicate since many of the indigenous people in question have little contact with the developed world and do not possess the antibodies to contagious diseases brought by outsiders. The IDB met in Lima, Peru the week of March 29, 2004 to discuss this and other problems. Post-IDB Career On June 1, 2005, Iglesias announced his resignation from the IDB, effective September 30, 2005. Later in 2005 he became secretary-general of the Ibero-American General Secretariat, a new organization to facilitate cooperation between Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. Enrique Igleasias is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them. He is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

The building became a National Historic Landmark in 1994 and is a contributing property to the Bellevue Avenue Historic District. It is owned and operated by the Preservation Society of Newport County and is open for visits all year. The mansion was built as the Newport summer home of Cornelius Vanderbilt II, a member of the wealthy United States Vanderbilt family, in an architectural style based on the Italian Renaissance. It was designed by renowned architect Richard Morris Hunt with interior decoration by Jules Allard and Sons and Ogden Codman, Jr. The 70-room mansion has a gross area of and of living area on five floors, constructed between 1893 and 1895. The Ochre Point Avenue entrance is marked by sculpted iron gates, and the walkway gates are part of a limestone-and-iron fence that borders the property on all but the ocean side. The footprint of the house covers approximately or 43,000 square feet of the estate on the cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. History The Breakers gate in 1899 Front gates of the Breakers, 2013 Rear view facing sea, 1968 Side view of mansion, 1968 Cornelius Vanderbilt II purchased the grounds in 1885 for $450,000 ($ million today). The previous mansion on the property was owned by Pierre Lorillard IV; it burned on November 25, 1892 and Vanderbilt commissioned famed architect Richard Morris Hunt to rebuild it in splendor. Vanderbilt insisted that the building be made as fireproof as possible, so the structure of the building used steel trusses and no wooden parts. He even required that the boiler be located away from the house in an underground space below the front lawn.Vanderbilt, Arthur T. Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt Perennial: 1989. 185-87. The designers created an interior using marble imported from Italy and Africa, and rare woods and mosaics from countries around the world. It also included architectural elements purchased from chateaux in France, such as the library mantel. Expansion was finally finished in 1892.Vanderbilt, 185-6. The Breakers is the architectural and social archetype of the \\"Gilded Age,\\" a period when members of the Vanderbilt family were among the major industrialists of America.Gannon, Thomas. Newport Mansions: the Gilded Age. Fort Church Publishers, Inc., 1982: p. 8. It was the largest, most opulent house in the Newport area upon its completion in 1895. Vanderbilt died from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by a stroke in 1899 at age 55, leaving The Breakers to his wife Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt. She outlived him by 35 years and died at the age of 89 in 1934. She left The Breakers to her youngest daughter Countess Gladys Sz√©chenyi (1886‚Äì1965), essentially because Gladys lacked American property; in addition, none of her other children were interested in the property, while Gladys had always loved the estate. In 1948, Gladys leased the high-maintenance property to The Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 per year. The Preservation Society bought The Breakers and approximately 90% of its furnishings in 1972 for $365,000 ($ million today) from Countess Sylvia Szapary, Gladys' daughter, although the agreement granted her life tenancy. Upon her death in 1998, The Preservation Society agreed to allow the family to continue to live on the third floor, which is not open to the public. It is now the most-visited attraction in Rhode Island, with approximately 450,000 visitors annually as of 2017.https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode- island/articles/2017-04-10/controversial-project-at-the-breakers-mansion-to- begin-soon Gardens Gardens at The Breakers The pea-gravel driveway is lined with maturing pin oaks and red maples. The trees of The Breakers' grounds act as screens that increase the sense of distance between The Breakers and its Newport neighbors. Among the more unusual imported trees are two examples of the Blue Atlas Cedar, a native of North Africa. Clipped hedges of Japanese yew and Pfitzer juniper line the tree-shaded footpaths that meander about the grounds. Informal plantings of arbor vitae, taxus, Chinese juniper, and dwarf hemlock provide attractive foregrounds for the walls that enclose the formally landscaped terrace. The grounds also contain several varieties of other rare trees, copper and weeping beeches. These were hand- selected by Ernest W. Bowditch, a landscape architect and civil engineer based in the Boston area. Bowditch's original pattern for the south parterre garden was determined from old photographs and laid out in pink and white alyssum and blue ageratum. The wide borders paralleling the wrought iron fence are planted with rhododendron, mountain laurel, dogwoods, and many other flowering shrubs that effectively screen the grounds from street traffic and give visitors a feeling of seclusion. Layout Basement *Laundry *Staff's restrooms First floor The great hall The library Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt II (Alice Claypoole Vanderbilt) and her daughters, Gladys Vanderbilt Sz√©chenyi and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, having tea in the library at The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, 1932 The kitchen Mr. Vanderbilt's bedroom *Entrance foyer *Gentlemen's reception room *Ladies' reception room *Great hall ( √ó √ó ) ‚Äì Over each of the six doors that lead from the Great Hall are limestone figure groups celebrating humanity's progress in art, science, and industry: Galileo, representing science; Dante, representing literature; Apollo, representing the arts; Mercury, representing speed and commerce; Richard Morris Hunt, representing architecture; and Karl Bitter, representing sculpture. *Main staircase *Arcade *Library ‚Äì The library has coffered ceilings painted with a dolphin, symbolic of the sea and hospitality, supported by Circassian walnut paneling impressed with gold leaf in the form of a leather-bound book. Between the ceiling and the gold paneling lies green Spanish leather embossed with gold, which continues into the library from the alcove where the inhabitants played cards. Inside the central library rest two busts; the bronze bust depicts William Henry Vanderbilt II, the oldest child of Cornelius II and Alice, who died of typhoid at the age of 21 while attending Yale University. There is now a library at Yale dedicated to William Henry Vanderbilt II. The second bust, in marble, is of Cornelius Vanderbilt II. The fireplace, taken from a 16th-century French chateau (Arnay-le-Duc, Burgundy), bears the inscription \\"I laugh at great wealth, and never miss it; nothing but wisdom matters in the end.\\" *Music room ‚Äì The room's open interior was used for recitals and dances. Its woodwork and furnishings were designed by Richard Van der Boyen and implemented by Jules Allard and Sons. The room has a gilt coffered ceiling lined with silver and gold, as well as an elliptical ceiling molding which bears the inscription in French of song, music, harmony and melody. Around the edge are the names of well-known composers. The fireplace is of Campan marble and the tables were designed to match. Mr. Vanderbilt was known to play the violin and Mrs. Vanderbilt the piano, which is a Second Empire French mahogany ormolu mounted piano. *Morning room ‚Äì This room, a communal sitting room facing east to admit the morning sun, was used throughout the day, and was designed by the French company head Jules Allard. Placed around the room are platinum-leafed panels illustrated with 8 of the 9 muses. All interior woodwork and furnishings were designed and constructed in France, then shipped to America before assembly. *Lower loggia *Billiards room ‚Äì This room, in the style of ancient Rome, was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and shows his competence in stone works. The great slabs of Cippolino marble from Italy form the walls, while rose alabaster arches provide contrast. Throughout the room there is an assortment of semi-precious stones, forming mosaics of acorns (the Vanderbilt family emblem, intended to show strength and longevity) and billiards balls on the top walls. The Renaissance style mahogany furniture provides further contrast with that of the colored marble. *Dining room ‚Äì The dining room is the house's grandest room and has 12 freestanding rose alabaster Corinthian columns supporting a colossal carved and gilt cornice. Rich in allegory, this room serves as an exemplar of what 19th-century technology could do with Roman ideas and 18th- century inspiration. On the ceiling, the goddess Aurora is depicted bringing in the dawn on a four-horse chariot as Greek figures pose majestically. A 16th-century style table of carved oak seats up to 34. Two Baccarat crystal chandeliers light the room with either gas or electricity, and 18, 22 or 24 carat gold gilt adheres to the wall through rabbit skin glue. *Breakfast room ‚Äì The breakfast room, with its modified Louis XV style paneling and furnishings, was used for family morning meals. The furnishings, colors and gilt, although still extravagant in their use, contrast with the dining room's more lavish decoration.United States Department of the Interior / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form (Rev.8-86)Newport Preservation Society's Breakers Audio Tour *Pantry ‚Äì A central dumbwaiter serves to bring additional china and glassware down from the mezzanine level. The pantry was also used for the storage of the family's table silver; this was brought with the family when they traveled, and stored in a steel vault. An intercom system allows the butler to direct the necessary servants to their needed locations, and each number on the caller corresponds to a number on a room. *Kitchen ‚Äì The kitchen, unlike others in the time period, was situated on the first floor away from the main house to prevent the possibility of fires and cooking smells reaching the main parts of the house. The well-ventilated room supports a cast iron stove, which heats up as a single element through a coal burning stove. The work table is made of zinc, a metal which served as the forerunner to stainless steel; in front of it is a marble mortar used to crush various ingredients. Ice cut from the local ponds kept the side rooms cool where food was stored, and facilitated a colder room for the assembling of confections. The kitchen and baking pantry each have one dumbwaiter that travels to the basement level where groceries were delivered and refuse removed. Second floor *Mr. Vanderbilt's bedroom ‚Äì As with the rest of the second floor, Ogden Codman designed this room, choosing Louis XIV Style. The bed is made of carved walnut finish and the mantel is of rouge royal marble, which hosts a large mirror above to bring more light into the room. There lies much memorabilia of family and friends, though Cornelius Vanderbilt II lived only a year at the Breakers in good health, before dying the following year, 1899, of a stroke. *Mrs. Vanderbilt's bedroom ‚Äì Designed as a perfect oval, Alice Vanderbilt's room accommodates multiple doors, though they are cut into the wall to leave an undisturbed picture of geometric perfection, that connect the bedrooms. Alice had four closets to allow for her possible seven clothing changes per day, and a pager to administer and relegate family needs to the servants. This room also served as her study and had many bookshelves. Additionally, there are discreetly designed corridors that permitted female servants to maintain the laundry and costume needs of the family in a seemingly invisible fashion. *Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt's bedroom ‚Äì Gertrude, daughter of Cornelius II and Alice, was a less conforming character who wished to be loved for her personality rather than her wealth and family, and later found her match in Harry Payne Whitney, and became an artist. Around the room there lie multiple pieces of her art work, including \\"The Engineer\\", which was inspired by her brother during World War I, \\"Laborer\\", and another that commemorates the American Expeditionary Force of World War I. She moved into The Breakers when she was 19. Above her bed is a portrait by Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta of Miss Gertrude Vanderbilt at 5 years old, and beside that, to the left of the bed, is a sketch of her as a young woman. *Upper loggia ‚Äì Serving as an informal living room, the upper loggia faces east, and opens to the Atlantic. During the summer, when needed, the glass doors overlooking the great hall could be opened to allow a breezeway. The walls are painted marble, and the ceiling is designed to depict three canopies that cover the sky. The lawn, designed by James and Ernest Bowdwitch, hosted many parties and was well kept by a gardening staff of 20, who also introduced and maintained various non-indigenous trees. *Guest bedroom ‚Äì This room exemplifies the Louis XVI style through furniture, woodwork and light fixtures, with Neoclassical style abounding in the interior. The wall paneling has never been retouched, though the rest of the room has been restored by the preservation society. *Countess Szechenyi's bedroom ‚Äì Designed by Ogden Codman in 18th-century simple elegance style, this room features an ivory and cream-colored design. *There are also two other rooms located on the second floor, possibly a nursery and a nanny's bedroom. Third floor The third floor contains eight bedrooms and a sitting room decorated in Louis XVI style walnut paneling by Ogden Codman. The north wing of the third-floor quarters were reserved for domestic servants. Using ceilings nearly high, Richard Morris Hunt created two separate third floors to allow a mass aggregation of servant bed chambers. This was because of the configuration of the house, built in Italian Renaissance style, which included a pitched roof. Flat-roofed French classical houses built in the area at the time allowed a concealed wing for staff, whereas the Breakers' design did not permit this feature. A total of 30 bedrooms are located in the two third-floor staff quarters. Three additional bedrooms for the butler, chef, and visiting valet are located on the mezzanine \\"entresol\\" floor, located between the first and second floor just to the rear of the main kitchen. Attic floor The attic floor contained more staff quarters, general storage areas, and the innovative cisterns. One smaller cistern supplied hydraulic pressure for the 1895 Otis elevator, still functioning in the house even though the house was wired for electricity in 1933. Two larger cisterns supplied fresh and salt water to the many bathrooms in the house. Over the grand staircase is a stained glass skylight designed by artist John La Farge. Originally installed in the Vanderbilts' 1 West 57th Street (New York City) townhouse dining room, the skylight was removed in 1894 during an expansion of the house. Materials *Foundation: brick, concrete, and limestone *Trusses: steel *Walls: Indiana limestone *Roof: red terra cotta tile *Wall panels: platinum leaf (eight reliefs of mythological figures only) They used Gold leaf on the design. Mansion wall panels found to be platinum ‚Äì The Boston Globe *Other: marble (plaques), wrought iron (gates and fences) The architect The Breakers is also a definitive expression of Beaux-Arts architecture in American domestic design by one of the country's most influential architects Richard Morris Hunt. The Breakers was Hunt's final project; it is also one of his few surviving works and is valuable for its rarity as well as its architectural excellence. The Breakers made Hunt the \\"dean of American architecture\\", as he was called by his contemporaries,Wiseman, Carter (2000). Twentieth-century American Architecture: The Buildings and Their Makers, p. 30. W. W. Norton & Company. Retrieved April 30, 2014. and helped define the era in American life that Hunt helped to shape. New welcome center controversy A debate developed when The Preservation Society of Newport County made plans to build a new welcome center within the property's garden. The Newport Zoning Board approved the welcome center in January 2015.Preservation Society gets board's approval On January 9, 2017, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled that the Newport Zoning Board of Review was the correct body to determine the permissibility of the project.Providence Journal / January 9, 2017 The Welcome Center opened on June 14, 2018.

Morgan. Set in a future in which interstellar travel is facilitated by transferring consciousnesses between bodies (\\"sleeves\\"), it follows the attempt of Takeshi Kovacs, a former U.N. elite soldier turned private investigator, to investigate a rich man's death. It is followed by the sequels Broken Angels and Woken Furies. The book was adapted as a Netflix television series, also titled Altered Carbon, in 2018. In 2019 a graphic novel was created with Dynamite Comics. Premise In the future, humans have achieved virtual immortality. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their consciousness. If their body dies, their stack can be stored indefinitely. Their stacks can be downloaded into new bodies, or \\"sleeves\\", after death. Roman Catholics do not allow their stacks to be re-sleeved after death, as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics easy targets for murder, since killers know their victim may not be re-sleeved to testify. At the start of the novel, UN Resolution 653 is being debated. This proposition reverses precedent and would allow authorities to temporarily re-sleeve a deceased Catholic woman to testify in a murder trial. Dual-sleeving, or controlling two bodies with one personality, is strictly prohibited by U.N. law. While most people can afford to get resleeved at the end of their lives, they are unable to update their bodies and most go through the full aging process each time, which discourages most from resleeving more than once or twice. Thus, while people can live indefinitely in theory, most choose not to. Only the wealthy are able to acquire replacement bodies on a continual basis. Those who have lived for multiple lifespans are called Meths, a reference to the Biblical figure Methuselah. The very rich are also able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage, which they update regularly. This ensures that even if their stack is destroyed, they can be re-sleeved. People who commit serious crimes are imprisoned \\"on stack\\". Their consciousness is preserved and stored virtually, sometimes for decades, while their body is sold to the highest bidder to be used for re-sleeving another person. Numerous colony planets exist apart from Earth; many were previously inhabited by an extinct alien civilization referred to as the Martians. In order to deal with the challenges of interspace warfare, the U.N. created the Envoys. They are an elite military group with extensive training in re-sleeving and psychological modification, as well as combat. Envoys are so successful and dangerous that they are generally prohibited from holding elected office on any world. Plot summary On the colony planet of Harlan‚Äôs World, Takeshi Kovacs and his partner Sarah Sachilowski, former Envoys who had returned to a life of crime, are killed by a U.N. colonial commando unit. Kovacs is sentenced to a long term in stack storage. On Earth, a Meth named Laurens Bancroft has died in mysterious circumstances in Bay City (formerly San Francisco). The re-sleeved Bancroft has no memories of the previous two days, including his own death. Though police officer Kristin Ortega believes he committed suicide, Bancroft is convinced he was murdered. He hires Kovacs to investigate. Kovacs discovers that Bancroft has been involved with numerous prostitutes, including recent murder victim Elizabeth Elliot. Elizabeth‚Äôs mother Irene was imprisoned for illegally hacking Bancroft‚Äôs memories. Elizabeth's father is too poor to re- sleeve Elizabeth or to free his wife from the stacks. Laurens' wife, Miriam, seduces Kovacs and bribes him to end the investigation. A high-level Russian operative named Kadmin tries to assassinate Kovacs, but fails and is captured. Kovacs investigates the brothel where Elizabeth worked. He learns he is wearing the sleeve of Elias Ryker, a corrupt police officer and Ortega's lover. He is tortured by physicians from the Wei Clinic, who deal in black market sleeve theft. He tells his interrogators that he is an Envoy and they release him. A mysterious woman named Trepp says she will bring Kovacs to Ray, who is behind the clinic‚Äôs operations. Kovacs escapes, destroys the brothel and clinic, and murders the employees in the process. Kovacs and Ortega are injured in an explosion orchestrated by Kadmin, who has escaped police custody. Trepp brings Kovacs to \\"Ray\\", or Reileen Kawahara. Kawahara is a Meth mob boss with whom Kovacs has dealt in the past. He had rejected her offers of partnership, believing her to be cruel and manipulative. Kawahara orders Kovacs to end his investigation, or she will torture Sarah, who is currently in virtual storage. Kovacs and Ortega begin sleeping together and form a partnership. Kovacs agrees to convince Bancroft he committed suicide. His version of the story is as follows. Bancroft contracted the Rawlings virus from a brothel. The Rawlings virus is designed to scramble cortical stacks and prevent re-sleeving, causing permanent death. To prevent it from contaminating his clones, Bancroft committed suicide. Kawahara agreed to procure a copy of the virus for Kovacs. With Kawahara‚Äôs help, he retrieves Irene Elliot from stack, and hires her to implant the Rawlings virus into a brothel. Kovacs learns that Bancroft went to an airship-turned-brothel named Head in the Clouds on the night he died. This establishment is run by Kawahara. Kadmin kidnaps Ortega and threatens to kill her unless Kovacs trades himself for her. Ortega is released, and Kovacs is forced to fight in a duel against Kadmin. Trepp and the police arrive, killing Kadmin. Kovacs destroys Kadmin‚Äôs stack. Kovacs double-sleeves, controlling both Ryker and a second body simultaneously. The copy in Ryker‚Äôs sleeve leaves with Miriam to draw away surveillance. Ortega and Kovacs infiltrate Head in the Clouds. Irene spikes Kawahara‚Äôs personality backup with the Rawlings virus, destroying all of her clones. Kovacs forces a confession from Kawahara. After a Catholic prostitute was murdered at Head in the Clouds, her resurrection would have revealed Kawahara‚Äôs illegal activity. As part of her cover-up, Kawahara framed Ryker for corruption, since he was investigating the murder. She asked Bancroft to help her kill Resolution 653 to prevent the prostitute from testifying, but he refused. Kawahara and Miriam had Bancroft drugged; out of his mind, he killed a prostitute and then killed himself in order to erase the memory out of guilt and self-preservation. With his memories gone, Kawahara‚Äôs involvement could not be traced. Assisted by Trepp, Kovacs blows out the side of the airship. As he falls to the ocean below, he uses a grenade to destroy Kawahara‚Äôs stack, ensuring her permanent death. In the aftermath, Bancroft is cleared by the U.N. for his involvement with Kawahara. The copy of Kovacs that stayed with Miriam is erased, as double sleeving is illegal, but he makes the surviving copy of Kovacs promise to cover up Miriam's involvement. Irene Elliot gets her body back, Elizabeth and Ryker are freed from the stacks, Resolution 653 passes, and Kovacs is freed and returned to Harlan‚Äôs World. Reception Describing the book, Kirkus Reviews said that \\"The body count is high, the gadgetry pure genius, the sex scenes deliriously overwrought, and the worn cynicism thoroughly distasteful: a welcome return to cyberpunk's badass roots.\\" The book won the Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel in 2003. In other media Television A television adaptation was announced in 2016. An initial 10-episode season had been ordered by Netflix. The first season premiered on Netflix on 2 February 2018. Extensive and significant changes to the source material were made in the adaptation. In the series Envoys are presented as having been trained, deployed and led by Quellcrist Falconer as part of a revolution (called \\"the Unsettlement\\") that she leads on Harlan‚Äôs World (Kovacs' home planet). Kovacs is shown as having been trained as an Envoy by, and serving as a revolutionary under, Falconer. The Quellist Revolution is crushed by the Protectorate (the established, inter-planetary government) in an apocalyptic assault. Kovacs, the only survivor, is presented as the last Envoy. In the books, Envoys were and are the elite forces of the Protectorate (which would have been fighting against the revolution); Falconer did lead a revolution but died long before Kovacs was born; Kovacs trained as an Envoy under a different woman; and the Envoy Corps is still very much in use by the Protectorate and remains widely feared, although Kovacs is no longer a member of Corps. The makers of the show have also chosen to expand the roles of many characters, particularly female characters. In the book, the hotel in which Kovacs stays while investigating Bancroft‚Äôs murder is themed after Jimi Hendrix. Since the Hendrix estate does not approve of licensing his image for anything they consider violent, the show instead chose the figure of Edgar Allan Poe and named the hotel The Raven. Film On 8 November 2018, Netflix announced an animated companion film, Altered Carbon: Resleeved, set in the same universe and exploring new elements of the story mythology. On 10 February 2020, it was unveiled that the exclusive Netflix \\"anime featured\\" spin-off would debut on 19 March 2020. The film was directed by Jo Nakajima at Anima; Yoshiyuki Okada designed the characters, Ren Kikuchi supervised the CG animation, and MONACA composed the music. The Japanese cast includes Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Takeshi Kovacs, Rina Satou as Gina, Ayaka Asai as Holly Togram, Jouji Nakata as Ogai, Kenji Yamauchi as Hideki Tanaseda, Kanehira Yamamoto as Shinji, and K≈çji Ishii as Genzo.

The current building was begun in the 14th century and extended until the early 16th century; significant alterations were undertaken in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the addition of the Thistle Chapel. St Giles' is closely associated with many events and figures in Scottish history, including John Knox, who served as the church's minister after the Scottish Reformation.Gordon 1958, p. 31. Likely founded in the 12th century and dedicated to Saint Giles, the church was elevated to collegiate status by Pope Paul II in 1467. In 1559, the church became Protestant with John Knox, the foremost figure of the Scottish Reformation, as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, such as a prison and as a meeting place for the Parliament of Scotland. In 1633, Charles I made St Giles' the cathedral of the newly created Diocese of Edinburgh. Charles' attempt to impose a Scottish Prayer Book in St Giles' on 23 July 1637 caused a riot, which precipitated the formation of the Covenanters and the beginnings of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \\"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\\". St Giles' is one of Scotland's most important medieval parish church buildings. The first church of St Giles' was a small, Romanesque building of which only fragments remain. In the 14th century, this was replaced by the current building, which was enlarged between the late 14th and early 16th centuries. The church was altered between 1829 and 1833 by William Burn and restored between 1872 and 1883 by William Hay with the support of William Chambers. Chambers hoped to make St Giles' a \\"Westminster Abbey for Scotland\\" by enriching the church and adding memorials to notable Scots. Between 1909 and 1911, the Thistle Chapel, designed by Robert Lorimer, was added to the church.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 103-118. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services; the services of the Order of the Thistle take place here. Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites: it attracted over a million visitors in 2018. Name and dedication boss in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel Saint Giles is the patron saint of lepers. Though chiefly associated with the Abbey of Saint-Gilles in modern-day France, he was a popular saint in medieval Great Britain.Farmer 1978, p. 189.Marshall 2009, p. 2. The church was first possessed by the monks of the Order of St Lazarus, who ministered among lepers; if David I or Alexander I is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister Matilda, who founded St Giles in the Fields.Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4. Prior to the Reformation, St Giles' was the only parish church in EdinburghGifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103. and some contemporary writers, such as Jean Froissart, refer simply to the \\"church of Edinburgh\\".Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5. From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \\"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\\".Lees 1889, p. 43. Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \\"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\\".Lees 1889, p. 155. The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \\"Saint Giles' Kirk\\".Lees 1889, p. 204. St Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1689 during periods of episcopacy within the Church of Scotland. Since 1689, the Church of Scotland, as a Presbyterian church, has had no bishops and, therefore, no cathedrals. St Giles' is one of a number of former cathedrals in the Church of Scotland ‚Äì such as Glasgow Cathedral or Dunblane Cathedral ‚Äì that retain their title despite having lost this status. Since the church's initial elevation to cathedral status, the building as a whole has generally been called St Giles' Cathedral, St Giles' Kirk or Church, or simply St Giles'.Lees 1889, p. 205. The title \\"High Kirk\\" is briefly attested during the reign of James VI as referring to the whole building. A 1625 order of the Privy Council of Scotland refers to the Great Kirk congregation, which was then meeting in St Giles', as the \\"High Kirk\\". The title fell out of use until reapplied in the late 18th century to the East (or New) Kirk, the most prominent of the four congregations then meeting in the church.Marshall 2009, p. 110.Dunlop 1988, p. 17. Since 1883, the High Kirk congregation has occupied the entire building.Marshall 2009, pp. 135-136. Location Tolbooth and Luckenbooths on the north of the church and Parliament House in the kirkyard to its south The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland identified St Giles' as \\"the central focus of the Old Town\\".RCAHMS 1951, p. 25. The church occupies a prominent and flat portion of the ridge that leads down from Edinburgh Castle; it sits on the south side of the High Street: the main street of the Old Town and one of the streets that make up the Royal Mile.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 419.Coltart 1936, p. 136. From its initial construction in the 12th century until the 14th century, St Giles' was located near the eastern edge of Edinburgh.Catford 1975, p. 17.Marshall 2009, p. 3. By the time of the construction of the King's Wall in the mid-15th century, the burgh had expanded and St Giles' stood near its central point.Catford 1975, pp. 274-275. In the late medieval and early modern periods, St Giles' was also located at the centre of Edinburgh's civic life: the Tolbooth ‚Äì Edinburgh's administrative centre ‚Äì stood immediately north-west of the church and the Mercat Cross ‚Äì Edinburgh's commercial and symbolic centre ‚Äì stood immediately north-east of it.Harris 1996, pp. 213-214, 605. From the construction of the Tolbooth in the late 14th century until the early 19th century, St Giles' stood in the most constricted point of the High Street with the Luckenbooths and Tolbooth jutting into the High Street immediately north and north-west of the church.Harris 1996, p. 605. A lane known as the Stinkand Style (or Kirk Style) was formed in the narrow space between the Luckenbooths and the north side of the church.Marshall 2009, pp. 30, 110.Harris 1996, p. 586. In this lane, open stalls known as the Krames were set up between the buttresses of the church.Catford 1975, p. 44. St Giles' forms the north side of Parliament Square with the Law Courts on the south side of the Square. The area immediately south of the church was originally the kirkyard, which stretched downhill to the Cowgate.Marshall 2009, p. 30. This was closed to burials in 1561 and handed over to the town council in 1566. From the construction of Parliament House in 1639, the former kirkyard was developed and the Square formed. The west front of St Giles' faces the former Midlothian County Buildings across West Parliament Square.Harris 1996, p. 485. History Early years David I holds a speculative model of the first St Giles' in a 20th-century window. The foundation of St Giles' is usually dated to 1124 and attributed to David I.Marshall 2009, pp. 2-4.McIlwain 1994, p. 4. The parish was likely detached from the older parish of St Cuthbert's.Gray 1940, p. 23. David raised Edinburgh to the status of a burgh and, during his reign, the church and its lands (St Giles' Grange) are first attested, being in the possession of monks of the Order of Saint Lazarus.Lees 1889, p. 2.Marshall 2009, p. 4. Remnants of the destroyed Romanesque church display similarities to the church at Dalmeny, which was built between 1140 and 1166. St Giles' was consecrated by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews on 6 October 1243. As St Giles' is attested almost a century earlier, this was likely a re-consecration to correct the loss of any record of the original consecration.Marshall 2009, p. 6. In 1322 during the First Scottish War of Independence, troops of Edward II of England despoiled Holyrood Abbey and may have attacked St Giles' as well.Marshall 2009, p. 8. Jean Froissart records that, in 1384, Scottish knights and barons met secretly with French envoys in St Giles' and, against the wishes of Robert II, planned a raid into the northern counties of England.Lees 1889, p. 5. Though the raid was a success, Richard II of England took retribution on the Scottish borders and Edinburgh in August 1385 and St Giles' was burned. The scorch marks were reportedly still visible on the pillars of the crossing in the 19th century.Marshall 2009, p. 9. At some point in the 14th century, the 12th century Romanesque St Giles' was replaced by the current Gothic church. At least the crossing and nave had been built by 1387 as, in that year, John Skuyer, John Primrose, and John of Scone were commissioned to add five chapels to the south side of the nave.Marshall 2009, pp. 9-10.Lees 1889, pp. 17-18. In the 1370s, the Lazarite friars supported the King of England and St Giles' reverted to the Scottish crown. In 1393, Robert III granted St Giles' to Scone Abbey in compensation for the expenses incurred by the Abbey in 1390 during the King's coronation and the funeral of his father.Marshall 2009, p. 11.Lees 1889, p. 21. Subsequent records show clerical appointments at St Giles' were made by the monarch, suggesting the church reverted to the crown soon afterwards.Lees 1889, p. 28. Collegiate church In 1419, Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas led an unsuccessful petition to Pope Martin V to elevate St Giles' to collegiate status. Unsuccessful petitions to Rome followed in 1423 and 1429.Marshall 2009, pp. 23-24. The burgh launched another petition for collegiate status in 1466, which was granted by Pope Paul II in February 1467.Marshall 2009, p. 26. The foundation replaced the role of vicar with a provost accompanied by a curate, sixteen canons, a beadle, a minister of the choir, and four choristers.Burleigh 1960, p. 81 Preston Aisle During the period of these petitions, William Preston of Gorton had, with the permission of Charles VII of France, brought from France the arm bone of Saint Giles, an important relic. From the mid-1450s, the Preston Aisle was added to the southern side of the choir to commemorate this benefactor; Preston's eldest male descendants were given the right to carry the relic at the head of the Saint Giles' Day procession every 1 September.Lees 1889, pp. 33-35.Marshall 2009 pp. 15-16. Around 1460, extension of the chancel and the addition thereto of a clerestory were supported by Mary of Guelders, possibly in memory of her husband, James II.Lees 1889, pp. 34-35. In the years following St Giles' elevation to collegiate status, the number of chaplainries and endowments increased greatly and by the Reformation there may have been as many as fifty altars in St Giles'.Lees 1889, p. 48.Marshall 2009, p. 32. In 1470, Pope Paul II further elevated St Giles' status by granting a petition from James III to exempt the church from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of St Andrews.Lees 1889, p. 44. During Gavin Douglas' provostship, St Giles' was central to Scotland's response to national disaster of the Battle of Flodden in 1513. As Edinburgh's men were ordered by the town council to defend the city, its women were ordered to gather in St Giles' to pray for James IV and his army.Lees 1889, p. 69. Requiem Mass for the King and the memorial mass for the dead of the battle were held in St Giles' and Walter Chepman endowed a chapel of the Crucifixion in the lower part of the kirkyard in the King's memory.Marshall 2009, p. 29.Lees 1889, p. 72. The earliest record of Reformed sentiment at St Giles' is in 1535, when Andrew Johnston, one of the chaplains, was forced to leave Scotland on the grounds of heresy.Marshall 2009, p. 42. In October 1555, the town council ceremonially burned English language books, likely Reformers‚Äô texts, outside St Giles'.Marshall 2009, p. 45. The theft from the church of images of the Virgin, St Francis, and the Trinity in 1556 may have been agitation by reformers.Lees 1889, p. 101. In July 1557, the church's statue of its patron, Saint Giles, was stolen and, according to John Knox, drowned in the Nor Loch then burned.Lees 1889, p. 103. For use in that year's Saint Giles' Day procession, the statue was replaced by one borrowed from Edinburgh's Franciscans; though this was also damaged when Protestants disrupted the event.Marshall 2009, pp. 43-44. Reformation Statue of John Knox by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray At the beginning of 1559, with the Scottish Reformation gaining ground, the town council hired soldiers to defend St Giles' from the Reformers; the council also distributed the church's treasures among trusted townsmen for safekeeping.Lees 1889, pp. 107-108. At 3 pm on 29 June 1559 the army of the Lords of the Congregation entered Edinburgh unopposed and, that afternoon, John Knox, the foremost figure of the Reformation in Scotland, first preached in St Giles'.Lees 1889, p. 108.Burleigh 1960, p. 144. The following week, Knox was elected minister of St Giles' and, the week after that, the purging of the church's Roman Catholic furnishings began.Lees 1889, p. 109. Mary of Guise (who was then ruling as regent for her daughter Mary) offered Holyrood Abbey as a place of worship for those who wished to remain in the Roman Catholic faith while St Giles' served Edinburgh's Protestants. Mary of Guise also offered the Lords of the Congregation that the parish church of Edinburgh would, after 10 January 1560, remain in whichever confession proved the most popular among the burgh's inhabitants.Lees 1889, p. 110.Marshall 2009, p. 49. These proposals, however, came to nothing and the Lords of the Congregation signed a truce with the Roman Catholic forces and vacated Edinburgh. Knox, fearing for his life, left the city on 24 July 1559.Lees 1889, p. 112. St Giles', however, remained in Protestant hands. Knox's depute, John Willock, continued to preach even as French soldiers disrupted his sermons and ladders, to be used in the Siege of Leith, were constructed in the church.Lees 1889, p. 114. The events of the Scottish Reformation thereafter briefly turned in favour of the Roman Catholic party: they retook Edinburgh and the French agent Nicolas de Pellev√©, Bishop of Amiens, reconsecrated St Giles' as a Roman Catholic church on 9 November 1559.Lees 1889, pp. 115-116. After the Treaty of Berwick secured the intervention of Elizabeth I of England on the side of the Reformers, they retook Edinburgh. St Giles' once again became a Protestant church on 1 April 1560 and Knox returned to Edinburgh on 23 April 1560.Lees 1889, pp. 117, 119. The Parliament of Scotland legislated that, from 24 August 1560, the Pope had no authority in Scotland.Marshall 2009, p. 50. Workmen, assisted by sailors from the Port of Leith, took nine days to clear stone altars and monuments from the church. Precious items used in pre-Reformation worship were sold.Lees 1889, pp. 118-119. The church was whitewashed, its pillars painted green, and the Ten Commandments and Lord's Prayer painted on the walls.Marshall 2009, p. 52. Seating was installed for children and the burgh's council and incorporations. A pulpit was also installed, likely at the eastern side of the crossing.Marshall 2009, p. 53. In 1561, the kirkyard to the south of the church was closed and most subsequent burials were conducted at Greyfriars Kirkyard.Marshall 2009, p. 61. Church and crown: 1567‚Äì1633 John Knox preaching the funeral sermon of the Regent Moray, depicted in a 19th-century window In 1567, Mary, Queen of Scots was deposed and succeeded by her infant son, James VI, St Giles' was a focal point of the ensuing Marian civil war. After his assassination in January 1570, the Regent Moray, a leading opponent of Mary, Queen of Scots, was interred within the church; John Knox preached at this event. Edinburgh briefly fell to Mary's forces and, in June and July 1572, William Kirkcaldy of Grange stationed soldiers and cannon in the tower.Lees 1889, pp. 156-157. Although his assistant John Craig had remained in Edinburgh during these events, Knox, his health failing, had retired to St Andrews. A deputation from Edinburgh recalled him to St Giles' and there he preached his final sermon on 9 November 1572.Lees 1889, pp. 157-158. Knox died later that month and was buried in the kirkyard in the presence of the Regent Morton.Marshall 2009, p. 68.Burleigh 1960, p. 195. After the Reformation, parts of St Giles' were given over to secular purposes. In 1562 and 1563, the western three bays of the church were partitioned off by a wall to serve as an extension to the Tolbooth: it was used, in this capacity, as a meeting place for the burgh's criminal courts, the Court of Session, and the Parliament of Scotland.Marshall 2009, p. 65. Recalcitrant Roman Catholic clergy (and, later, inveterate sinners) were imprisoned in the room above the north door.Marshall 2009, p. 54. The tower was also used as a prison by the end of the 16th century.Lees 1889, p. 200. The Maiden ‚Äî an early form of guillotine ‚Äî was stored in the church.Coltart 1936, p. 135. The vestry was converted into an office and library for the town clerk and weavers were permitted to set up their looms in the loft.Lees 1889, p. 124. Around 1581, the interior was partitioned into two meeting houses: the chancel became the East (or Little or New) Kirk and the crossing and the remainder of the nave became the Great (or Old) Kirk. These congregations, along with Trinity College Kirk and the Magdalen Chapel, were served by a joint kirk session. In 1598, the upper storey of the Tolbooth partition was converted into the West (or Tolbooth) Kirk.Marshall 2009, p. 69.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 103, 106. During the early majority of James VI, the ministers of St Giles' ‚Äì led by Knox's successor, James Lawson ‚Äì formed, in the words of Cameron Lees, \\"a kind of spiritual conclave with which the state had to reckon before any of its proposals regarding ecclesiastical matters could become law\\".Lees 1889, p. 170. During his attendance at the Great Kirk, James was often harangued in the ministers' sermons and relations between the King and the Reformed clergy deteriorated.Marshall 2009, p. 72. In the face of opposition from St Giles' ministers, James introduced successive laws to establish episcopacy in the Church of Scotland from 1584.Marshall 2009, pp. 74-75. Relations reached their nadir after a tumult at St Giles' on 17 December 1596. The King briefly removed to Linlithgow and the ministers were blamed for inciting the crowd; they fled the city rather than comply with their summons to appear before the King.Lees 1889, pp. 186-187. To weaken the ministers, James made effective, as of April 1598, an order of the town council from 1584 to divide Edinburgh into distinct parishes.Lees 1889, p. 192. In 1620, the Upper Tolbooth congregation vacated St Giles' for the newly established Greyfriars Kirk.Dunlop 1988, p. 75.Steele 1993, p. 4. Cathedral Riot against the introduction of the prayer book James' son and successor, Charles I, first visited St Giles' on 23 June 1633 during his visit to Scotland for his coronation. He arrived at the church unannounced and displaced the reader with clergy who conducted the service according to the rites of the Church of England.Lees 1889, pp. 202-203. On 29 September that year, Charles, responding to a petition from John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St Andrews, elevated St Giles' to the status of a cathedral to serve as the seat of the new Bishop of Edinburgh.Burleigh 1960, pp. 211-212. Work began to remove the internal partition walls and to furnish the interior in the manner of Durham Cathedral.Lees 1889, p. 206. Work on the church was incomplete when, on 23 July 1637, the replacement in St Giles' of Knox's Book of Common Order by a Scottish version of the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer provoked rioting due to the latter's perceived similarities to Roman Catholic ritual. Tradition attests that this riot was started when a market trader named Jenny Geddes threw her stool at the Dean, James Hannay.Marshall 2009, pp. 82-83.Catford, 1975, p. 50. In response to the unrest, services at St Giles' were temporarily suspended.Marshall 2009, p. 84. Marquess of Montrose The events of 23 July 1637 led to the signing of the National Covenant in February 1638, which, in turn, led to the Bishops' Wars, the first conflict of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.Marshall 2009, p. 87. St Giles' again became a Presbyterian church and the partitions were restored.Lees 1889, pp. 219-220. Before 1643, the Preston Aisle was also fitted out as a permanent meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.Lees 1889, p. 222. In autumn 1641, Charles I attended Presbyterian services in the East Kirk under the supervision of its minister, Alexander Henderson, a leading Covenanter. The King had lost the Bishops' Wars and had come to Edinburgh because the Treaty of Ripon compelled him to ratify Acts of the Parliament of Scotland passed during the ascendancy of the Covenanters.Marshall 2009, p. 88. After the Covenanters' loss at the Battle of Dunbar, troops of the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell entered Edinburgh and occupied the East Kirk as a garrison church.Lees 1889, p. 225. General John Lambert and Cromwell himself were among English soldiers who preached in the church and, during the Protectorate, the East Kirk and Tolbooth Kirk were each partitioned in two.Marshall 2009, p. 93.Lees 1889, p. 228. At the Restoration in 1660, the Cromwellian partition was removed from the East Kirk and a new royal loft was installed there.Lees 1889, pp. 230-231. In 1661, the Parliament of Scotland, under Charles II, restored episcopacy and St Giles' became a cathedral again.Lees 1889, p. 231. At Charles' orders, the body of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose ‚Äì a senior supporter of Charles I executed by the Covenanters ‚Äì was re-interred in St Giles'.Marshall 2009, p. 95. The reintroduction of bishops sparked a new period of rebellion and, in the wake of the Battle of Rullion Green in 1666, Covenanters were imprisoned in the former priests' prison above the north door, which, by then, had become known as \\"Haddo's Hole\\" due to the imprisonment there in 1644 of Royalist leader Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo.Lees 1889, p. 239. After the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish bishops remained loyal to James VII.Lees 1889, pp. 243-244. On the advice of William Carstares, who later became minister of the High Kirk, William II supported the abolition of bishops in the Church of Scotland and, in 1689, the Parliament of Scotland restored Presbyterian polity.Lees 1889, p. 247.Burleigh 1960, pp. 261-262.Marshall 2009, p. 98. In response, many ministers and congregants left the Church of Scotland, effectively establishing the independent Scottish Episcopal Church. In Edinburgh alone, eleven meeting houses of this secession sprang up, including the congregation that became Old St Paul's, which was founded when Alexander Rose, the last Bishop of Edinburgh in the established church, led much of his congregation out of St Giles'.Gray 1940, p. 19.Lees 1889, p. 245. Four churches in one: 1689‚Äì1843 General Assembly of 1787, held in the Preston Aisle of St Giles' In 1699, the courtroom in the northern half of the Tolbooth partition was converted into the New North (or Haddo's Hole) Kirk.Marshall 2009, p. 99. At the Union of Scotland and England's Parliaments in 1707, the tune \\"Why Should I Be Sad on my Wedding Day?\\" rang out from St Giles' recently installed carillon.Marshall 2009, p. 101. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, inhabitants of Edinburgh met in St Giles' and agreed to surrender the city to the advancing army of Charles Edward Stuart.Lees 1889, p. 251. From 1758 to 1800, Hugh Blair, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment and religious moderate, served as minister of the High Kirk; his sermons were famous throughout Britain and attracted Robert Burns and Samuel Johnson to the church. Blair's contemporary, Alexander Webster, was a leading evangelical who, from his pulpit in the Tolbooth Kirk, expounded strict Calvinist doctrine.Lees 1889, pp. 255-256, 295.Marshall 2009, p. 105. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Luckenbooths and Tolbooth, which had enclosed the north side of the church, were demolished along with shops built up around the walls of the church.Lees 1889, pp. 258-259. The exposure of the church's exterior revealed its walls were leaning outwards. In 1817, the city council commissioned Archibald Elliot to produce plans for the church's restoration. Elliot's drastic plans proved controversial and, due to a lack of funds, nothing was done with them.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 106.Lees 1889, p. 258. The High Kirk during the visit of George IV in 1822 George IV attended service in the High Kirk during his 1822 visit to Scotland.Lees 1889, p. 259. The publicity of the King's visit created impetus to restore the now- dilapidated building.Lees 1889, pp. 258, 260. With ¬£20,000 supplied by the city council and the government, William Burn was commissioned to lead the restoration.Marshall 2009, p. 112.Lees 1889, p. 265. Burn's initial plans were modest, but, under pressure from the authorities, Burn produced something closer to Elliot's plans.Marshall 2009, pp. 112, 116. Between 1829 and 1833, Burn significantly altered the church: he encased the exterior in ashlar, raised the church's roofline and reduced its footprint. He also added north and west doors and moved the internal partitions to create a church in the nave, a church in the choir, and a meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the southern portion. Between these, the crossing and north transept formed a large vestibule. Burn also removed internal monuments; the General Assembly's meeting place in the Preston Aisle; and the police office and fire engine house, the building's last secular spaces.Lees 1889, pp. 261-264.Marshall 2009, pp. 113-115. Burn's contemporaries were split between those who congratulated him on creating a cleaner, more stable building and those who regretted what had been lost or altered.Marshall 2009, p. 115.Lees 1889, pp. 263-264 In the Victorian era and the first half of the 20th century, Burn's work fell far from favour among commentators.Gray 1940, p. 21.Lees 1889, p. 264. Its critics included Robert Louis Stevenson, who stated: \\"‚Ä¶zealous magistrates and a misguided architect have shorn the design of manhood and left it poor, naked, and pitifully pretentious.\\"Stevenson 1879, p. 10. Since the second half of the 20th century, Burn's work has been recognised as having secured the church from possible collapse.Marshall 2009, p. 116.Gordon 1959, p. 4.Fawcett 1994, p. 186. The High Kirk returned to the choir in 1831. The Tolbooth Kirk returned to the nave in 1832; when they left for a new church on Castlehill in 1843, the nave was occupied by the Haddo's Hole congregation. The General Assembly found its new meeting hall inadequate and met there only once, in 1834; the Old Kirk congregation moved into the space.Marshall 2009, pp. 115-116.Dunlop 1988, p. 20. Victorian era Chambers restoration on 23 May 1883. At the Disruption of 1843, Robert Gordon and James Buchanan, ministers of the High Kirk, left their charges and the established church to join the newly founded Free Church. A significant number of their congregation left with them; as did William King Tweedie, minister of the first charge of the Tolbooth Kirk, and Charles John Brown, minister of Haddo's Hole Kirk.Lees 1889, p. 265, 304.Dunlop 1988, p. 98. The Old Kirk congregation was suppressed in 1860.Marshall 2009, p. 125. At a public meeting in Edinburgh City Chambers on 1 November 1867, William Chambers, publisher and Lord Provost of Edinburgh, first advanced his ambition to remove the internal partitions and restore St Giles' as a \\"Westminster Abbey for Scotland\\".Marshall 2009, p. 120. Chambers commissioned Robert Morham to produce initial plans. Lindsay Mackersy, solicitor and session clerk of the High Kirk, supported Chambers' work and William Hay was engaged as architect; a management board to supervise the design of new windows and monuments was also created.Marshall 2009, pp. 121-122.Lees 1889, p. 273. The restoration was part of a movement for liturgical beautification in late 19th century Scottish Presbyterianism and many evangelicals feared the restored St Giles' would more resemble a Roman Catholic church than a Presbyterian one.Marshall 2009, pp. 124-125, 139.Burleigh 1960, pp. 389-390. Nevertheless, the Presbytery of Edinburgh approved plans in March 1870 and the High Kirk was restored between June 1872 and March 1873: the pews and gallery were replaced with stalls and chairs and, for the first time since the Reformation, stained glass and an organ were introduced.Marshall 2009, pp. 122-127. The restoration of the former Old Kirk and the West Kirk began in January 1879.Marshall 2009, p. 127. In 1881, the West Kirk vacated St. Giles'. During the restoration, many human remains were unearthed; these were transported in five large boxes for reinterment in Greyfriars Kirkyard.Marshall 2009, p. 123. Although he had managed to view the reunified interior, William Chambers died on 20 May 1883, only three days before John Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen, Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, ceremonially opened the restored church; Chambers' funeral was held in the church two days after its reopening.Marshall 2009 pp. 136-138. 20th and 21st centuries The interior at the beginning of the 20th century, looking east from the nave In 1911, George V opened the newly constructed chapel of the knights of the Order of the Thistle at the south east corner of the church.Matthew 1988, pp. 19-21. Though the church had hosted a special service for the Church League for Women's Suffrage, Wallace Williamson‚Äôs refusal to pray for imprisoned suffragettes led to their supporters disrupting services during late 1913 and early 1914.Marshall 2009, p. 152. 99 members of the congregation - including the assistant minister, Matthew Marshall - were killed in World War I. In 1917, St Giles' hosted the lying-in-state and funeral of Elsie Inglis, medical pioneer and member of the congregation.Marshall 2009, p. 153. Ahead of the 1929 reunion of the United Free Church of Scotland and the Church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 transferred ownership of St Giles' from the City of Edinburgh Council to the Church of Scotland.Marshall 2009, p. 156.Burleigh 1960, p. 403. The church escaped World War II undamaged. The week after VE Day, the royal family attended a thanksgiving service in St Giles'. The Albany Aisle at the north west of the church was subsequently adapted to serve as a memorial chapel to the 39 members of the congregation killed in the conflict.Marshall 2009, pp. 158-159. To mark her first visit to Scotland since her coronation, Elizabeth II received the Honours of Scotland at a special service in St Giles' on 24 June 1953.Marshall 2009, pp. 160-161. From 1973 to 2013, Gilleasbuig Macmillan served as minister of St Giles'. During Macmillan's incumbency, the church was restored and the interior reoriented around a central communion table, the interior floor was levelled and undercroft space was created by Bernard Feilden. St Giles' remains an active parish church as well as hosting concerts, special services, and events. In 2018, St Giles' was the fourth most popular visitor site in Scotland with over 1.3 million visitors that year. Architecture The first St Giles' was likely a small, Romanesque building of the 12th century with a rectangular nave and semi-circular apsidal chancel. Before the middle of the 13th century, an aisle was added to the south of the church. By 1385, this building had likely been replaced by the core of the current church: a nave and aisles of five bays, a crossing and transepts, and a choir of four bays.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii pp. 419-420. The church was extended in stages between 1387 and 1518.Fawcett 2002, pp. 335-336. In Richard Fawcett's words, this \\"almost haphazard addition of large numbers of chapels\\" produced \\"an extraordinarily complex plan\\".Fawcett 2002, p. 45. The resultant profusion of outer aisles is typical of French medieval church architecture but unusual in Britain.Hannah 1934, pp. 150, 156, 159.Coltart 1936, p. 10. Apart from the internal partitioning of the church in the wake of the Reformation, few significant alterations were made until the restoration by William Burn in 1829‚Äì33, which included the removal of several bays of the church, the addition of clerestories to the nave and transepts, and the encasement of the church's exterior in polished ashlar. The church was significantly restored under William Hay between 1872 and 1883, including the removal of the last internal partitions. In the late 19th century, a number of ground level rooms were added around the periphery of the church. The Thistle Chapel was added to the south-east corner of the church by Robert Lorimer in 1909‚Äì11. The most significant subsequent restoration commenced in 1979 under Bernard Feilden and Simpson & Brown: this included the levelling of the floor and the rearrangement of the interior around a central communion table.Marshall 2009, pp. 171-172. Exterior The exterior of the church, with the exception of the tower, dates almost entirely from William Burn's restoration of 1829-33 and afterwards.RCAHMS 1951, p. 26. Prior to this restoration, St Giles' possessed what Richard Fawcett called a \\"uniquely complex external appearance\\" as the result of the church's numerous extensions; externally, a number of chapels were emphasised by gables.Fawcett 1994, pp. 186-187. Burn restoration Following the early 19th century demolition of the Luckenbooths, Tolbooth, and shops built against St Giles', the walls of the church were exposed to be leaning outward by as much as one and a half feet in places. Burn encased the exterior of the building in polished ashlar of gray sandstone from Cullalo in Fife. This layer is tied to the existing walls by iron cramps and varies in width from eight inches (20 centimetres) at the base of the walls to five inches (12.5 centimetres) at the top. Burn co-operated with Robert Reid, the architect of new buildings in Parliament Square, to ensure the exteriors of their buildings would complement each other.Marshall 2009, p. 113. Burn significantly altered the profile of the church: he expanded the transepts, created a clerestory in the nave, added new doorways in the west front and north and south transepts, and replicated the cusped cresting from the east end of the church throughout the parapet. Alongside the Thistle Chapel, extensions since the Burn restoration include William Hay's additions of 1883: rooms south of the Moray Aisle, east of the south transept, and west of the north transept; in 1891, MacGibbon and Ross added a ladies‚Äô vestry ‚Äì now the shop ‚Äì at the east of the north transept.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker, pp. 107-108.Marshall 2009, p. 185. Burn created a symmetrical western fa√ßade by replacing the west window of the Albany Aisle at the northwest corner of the church with a double niche and by moving the west window of the inner south nave aisle to repeat this arrangement in the southern half. The west doorway dates from the Victorian restoration and is by William Hay: the doorway is flanked by niches containing small statues of Scottish monarchs and churchmen by John Rhind, who also carved the relief of Saint Giles in the tympanum. The metalwork of the west door is by Skidmore.Marshall 2009, pp. 134-135. In 2006, new steps and an access ramp were added to the west door by Morris and Steedman Associates.Marshall 2009, p. 190. In order to improve access to Parliament Square, Burn demolished the westernmost two bays of the outer south nave aisle, including the south porch and door. Burn also removed the western bay from the Holy Blood Aisle at the south of the church and, from the north side of the nave, removed the north porch along with an adjoining bay.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 106-107.Marshall 2009, p. 114. The lost porches likely dated from the late-15th century and were matched only by those at St John's Kirk, Perth and St Michael's Kirk, Linlithgow as the grandest two- storey porches on Scottish medieval churches. Like the porch at Linlithgow, on which they were likely based, the porches at St Giles' possessed an entry arch below an oriel window.Fawcett 2002, p. 90. Burn replicated this arrangement in a new doorway at the west of the Moray Aisle. On visiting the church prior to the Burn restoration, Thomas Rickman wrote: \\"... a few of the windows have the tracery remaining, but from most of them it has been cut away.\\"Rickman in Lees 1889, p. 261. Views of the church before the Burn restoration show intersecting tracery in some of the choir windows and looping patterns in the windows of the Holy Blood Aisle.Fawcett 1994, p. 189. Burn retained the tracery of the great east window, which had been restored by John Mylne the Younger in the mid-17th century. In the other windows Burn inserted new tracery based on late medieval Scottish examples.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.Marshall 2009, pp. 114-115. Tower and crown steeple St Giles' tower in the Victorian era, showing the clock faces removed in 1911 St Giles' possesses a central tower over its crossing: this arrangement is common in larger Scottish medieval secular churches.Coltart 1936, pp. 10, 43.Fawcett 2002, pp. 73-75. The tower was constructed in two stages. The lower section of the tower has lancet openings with \\"Y\\"-shaped tracery on every side.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 108. This had likely been completed by 1416, in which year the Scotichronicon records storks nesting there.RCAHMS 1951, p. 27. The upper stage of the tower has clusters of three cusped lancet openings on each side. The date of this work is uncertain, but it may relate both to fines levied on building works at St Giles' in 1486 and to rules of 1491 for the master mason and his men.Marshall 2009, p. 40. From at least 1590, there was a clock face on the tower and, by 1655, there were three faces. The clock faces were removed in 1911.Marshall 2009, pp. 72, 94, 154. St Giles' crown steeple is one of Edinburgh's most famous and distinctive landmarks.Catford 1975, p. 27.Coltart 1936, p. 133. Cameron Lees wrote of the steeple: \\"Edinburgh would not be Edinburgh without it.\\"Lees 1889, p. 1. Dendrochronological analysis dates the crown steeple to between 1460 and 1467. The steeple is one of two surviving medieval crown steeples in Scotland: the other is at King's College, Aberdeen and dates from after 1505. John Hume called St Giles' crown steeple \\"a serene reminder of the imperial aspirations of the late Stewart monarchs\\".Hume 2005, p. 42. The design, however, is English in origin, being found at St Nicholas' Church, Newcastle before it was introduced to Scotland at St Giles'; the medieval St Mary-le-Bow, London, may also have possessed a crown steeple.Fawcett 2002, p. 86.Hannah 1934, pp. 174-175. Another crown steeple existed at St Michael's Parish Church, Linlithgow until 1821 and others may have been planned, and possibly begun, at the parish churches of Haddington and Dundee.Coltart 1936, p. 48. These other examples are composed only of diagonal flying buttresses springing from the four corners of the tower; whereas the St Giles' steeple is unique among medieval crown steeples in being composed of eight buttresses: four springing from the corners and four springing from the centre of each side of the tower.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 449.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 109.Fawcett 2002, p. 85. For the arrival into Edinburgh of Anne of Denmark in 1590, 21 weather vanes were added to the crests of the steeple; these were removed prior to 1800 and replacements were installed in 2005.Marshall 2009, pp. 72, 189. The steeple was repaired by John Mylne the Younger in 1648. Mylne added pinnacles half-way up the crests of the buttresses; he is also largely responsible for the present appearance of the central pinnacle and may have rebuilt the tower's traceried parapet.Hay 1976, p. 252. The weathercock atop the central pinnacle was created by Alexander Anderson in 1667; it replaced an earlier weathercock of 1567 by Alexander Honeyman.Marshall 2009, pp. 66, 97. Nave The Buildings of Scotland series calls the nave \\"archaeologically the most complicated part of church\\".Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 112. Though the nave dates to the 14th century and is one of the oldest parts of the church, it has been significantly altered and extended since.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 420. The ceiling over the central section of the nave is a tierceron vault in plaster; this was added during William Burn's restoration of 1829‚Äì1833. Burn also heightened the walls of the central section of the nave by 16 feet (4.8 metres), adding windows to create a clerestory.RCAHMS 1951, p. 30. Burn is usually credited with removing a medieval vaulted ceiling from the nave; however, there is no contemporary record of this and it may have been removed before Burn's time.Hay 1976, p. 247. The corbels and shafts leading to the springers of the vaults were added by William Hay in 1882. Burn also removed an attic from above the central section of the nave: this contained several rooms and housed the church's bell-ringer.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 435. The outline of the nave roof prior to the Burn restoration can be observed on the wall above the western arch of the crossing.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 433. Hay is also responsible for the present arcade. Burn had earlier heightened the medieval arcade and replaced the octagonal 14th century pillars with pillars based on the 15th century example in the Albany Aisle. Hay replaced these pillars with replicas of the octagonal 14th century pillars of the choir. Originally, the south arcade of the nave was lower with a clerestory window above each arch. The lower height of the original arcade is indicated by a fragment of an arch, springing from the south west pier of the crossing. The arches of the clerestory windows, now filled-in, are still visible above the each arch of the arcade on the south side of the nave. The two arches nearest the crossing at the south nave arcade show taller arches, which likely relate to a medieval scheme to heighten the arcade; however, the presence of these blind arches in only two bays suggests the scheme proved abortive. North nave aisle and chapels The ceiling of the north nave aisle is a rib vault in a similar style to the Albany Aisle: this suggests the north nave aisle dates to the same campaign of building at the turn of the 15th century.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 113.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 426.RCAHMS 1951, p. 31. In the first decade of the 15th century, the Albany Aisle was erected as a northward extension of the two westernmost bays of the north nave aisle. The Aisle consists of two bays under a stone rib- vaulted ceiling.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 112-113.MacGibbon and Ross 1896 ii, pp. 122-126. The west window of the chapel was blocked up during the Burn restoration of 1829‚Äì33. The north wall of the Aisle contains a semi- circular tomb recess. The ceiling vaults are supported by a bundled pillar that supports a foliate capital and octagonal abacus upon which are the escutcheons of the Aisle's donors: Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas. This is the oldest example of a style of pillar repeated throughout the later additions to St Giles'.Fawcett 2002, pp. 201-202.Fawcett 1994, pp. 188-189. Richard Fawcett describes the repetition of this style of pillar and arcading as providing \\"some measure of control [‚Ä¶] to achieve a measure of architectural unity\\". Neither Albany nor Douglas was closely associated with St Giles' and tradition holds the aisle was donated in penance for their involvement in the death of David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay.Coltart 1936, p. 134.Lees 1889, pp. 22-23.Marshall 2009, pp. 12-13. In 1882, the floor of the Albany Aisle was paved with Minton tiles, bands of Irish marble, and tiled medallions depicting the arms of Scotland; Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany; and Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas.Marshall 2009, p. 132. For the Aisle's dedication as a memorial chapel in the wake of the Second World War, the Minton tiles were replaced with Leoch paving stones from Dundee while the heraldic medallions and marble bands were retained.Marshall 2009, p. 159. East of the Albany Aisle, two light-coloured stones below the Black Watch's Egyptian Campaign memorial mark the site of the Norman north door. Until its removal at the end of the 18th century, the doorway was the only feature of the 12th century Romanesque church in situ. An illustration of 1799 shows the doorway as a highly decorated structure, bearing similarities to doorways at the churches of Dalmeny and Leuchars.Marshall 2009, p. 5. A porch stood over the site of the north door until the Burn restoration of 1829‚Äì33. This consisted of a chamber over the doorway accessed from the church by a turnpike stair.Gordon 1959, p. 5. The lancet arch of the stairway door now frames the Second Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers' Second Boer War memorial. East of the former doorway is a recessed stoup.Hay 1976, p. 249. Two chapels formerly stood north of the easternmost two bays of the north nave aisle. Only the easternmost of these, the St Eloi Aisle, survived the Burn restoration.Lees 1889, p. 23. Its ceiling is a barrel vault with superficial ribs: this was installed during William Hay's restoration of 1881-83 and incorporates a boss from the original vault. The archway between the St Eloi Aisle and the north nave aisle is original to the 15th century construction. The west wall of the St Eloi Aisle contains a Romanesque capital from the original church. It was discovered during the clearance of rubble around the medieval east window of the north transept in 1880 and was reset in its present position.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 438. The floor of the St Eloi Aisle is marble with mosaic panels by Minton, depicting the emblem the Incorporation of Hammermen between the symbols of the four evangelists.Marshall 2009, pp.133, 136. South nave aisles The effects of the Burn restoration can be seen at the west end of the inner south nave aisle: on the left is a gap between the pillars and the screen wall that was erected after the demolition of two bays; on the right, the outline of the original window is visible. The inner and outer south nave aisles were likely begun in the later 15th century around the time of the Preston Aisle, which they strongly resemble. They were likely completed by 1510, when altars of the Holy Trinity, Saint Apollonia, and Saint Thomas were added to the west end of the inner aisle. The current aisles replaced the original south nave aisle and the five chapels by John Primrose, John Skuyer, and John of Perth, named in a contract of 1387. The inner aisle retains its original quadripartite vault; however, the plaster tierceron vault of the outer aisle (known as the Moray Aisle) dates to William Burn's restoration. During the Burn restoration, the two westernmost bays of the outer aisle were removed. There remains a prominent gap between the pillars of the missing bays and the 19th century wall. At the west end of the outer aisle, Burn added a new wall with a door and oriel window. Burn also replaced the window of the inner aisle with a smaller window, centred north of the original in order to accommodate a double niche on the exterior wall. The outline of the original window is still visible in the interior wall. In 1513, Alexander Lauder of Blyth commissioned an aisle of two bays at the eastern end of the outer south nave aisle: the Holy Blood Aisle is the easternmost and only surviving bay of this aisle.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 441. It is named for the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, to whom it was granted upon completion in 1518.Fawcett 2002, p. 335. The western bay of the Aisle and the pillar separating the two bays were removed during the Burn restoration and the remainder was converted to a heating chamber.Lees 1889, p. 262. The Aisle was restored to ecclesiastical use under William Hay. An elaborate late Gothic tomb recess occupies the south wall of the aisle. Crossing and transepts The piers of the crossing date to the original building campaign of the 14th century and may be the oldest part of the present church. The piers were likely raised around 1400, at which time the present vault and bell hole were created.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 422. The first stages of both transepts were likely completed by 1395, in which year the St John's Aisle was added to the north of the north transept. Initially, the north transept extended no further than the north wall of the aisles and possessed a tunnel-vaulted ceiling at the same height as those in the crossing and aisles. The arches between the transept and north aisles of the choir and nave appear to be 14th century.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 111. The St John's Chapel, extending north of the line of the aisles, was added in 1395; in its western end was a turnpike stair, which, at the Burn restoration, was re-set in the thick wall between the St Eloi Aisle and the north transept. The remains of St John's Chapel are visible in the east wall of the north transept: these include fragments of vaulting and a medieval window, which faces into the Chambers Aisle. The bottom half of this window's tracery, as far as its embattled transom, is original; curvilinear tracery was added to the upper half by MacGibbon and Ross in 1889‚Äì91. At the Burn restoration, the north transept was heightened and a clerestory and plaster vaulted ceiling inserted. A screen of 1881-83 by William Hay crosses the transept in line with the original north wall, creating a vestibule for the north door. The screen contains sculptures of the patron saints of the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh by John Rhind as well as the arms of William Chambers.Marshall 2009, p. 133. The ceiling and open screens within the vestibule were designed by Esm√© Gordon and added in 1940. A fragment of medieval blind tracery is visible at the western end of this screen. Initially, the south transept only extended to the line of the south aisles; it was extended in stages as the Preston, Chepman, and Holy Blood Aisles were added. The original barrel vault remains as far as an awkwardly inserted transverse arch supported on heavy corbels between the inner transept arches: this arch was likely inserted after the creation of the Preston Aisle, when the inner transept arches were expanded accordingly. The transverse arch carries an extension to the lower part of the tower, including a 15th-century traceried window.RCAHMS 1951, p. 32. The south transept was heightened and a clerestory and plaster vaulted ceiling were inserted during the Burn restoration. Choir The Buildings of Scotland series calls the choir the \\"finest piece of late medieval parish church architecture in Scotland\\". The choir dates to two periods of building: one in the 14th century and one in the 15th.Hannah 1934, p. 158. The choir was initially built as a hall church: as such, it was unique in Scotland. The western three bays of the choir date to this initial period of construction. The arcades of these bays are supported by simple, octagonal pillars. In the middle of the 15th century, two bays were added to the east end of the choir and the central section was raised to create a clerestory under a tierceron-vaulted ceiling in stone.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 110. The springers of the original vault are still visible above some of the capitals of the choir pillars and the outline of the original roof is visible above the eastern arch of the crossing. A grotesque at the intersection of the central rib of the ceiling and the east wall of the tower may be a fragment of the 12th century church. The two pillars and two demi-pillars constructed during this expansion in the easternmost bays of the choir are similar in type to those in the Albany Aisle. Of the two pillars added during this extension, the northern one is known as the \\"King's Pillar\\" as its capital bears the arms of James III on its east face; James II on its west face; Mary of Guelders on its north face; and France on its south face.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii pp. 429-430.Marshall 2009, p. 25. These arms date the work between the birth of James II in 1453 and the death of Mary of Guelders in 1463; the incomplete tressure in the arms of James II may indicate he was dead when the work commenced, dating it to after 1460.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 430. The southern pillar is known as the \\"Town's Pillar\\". Its capital bears the arms of William Preston of Gorton on its east face; James Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews on its west face; Nicholas Otterbourne, Vicar of Edinburgh on its north face; and Edinburgh on its south face. The south respond bears the arms of Thomas Cranstoun, Chief Magistrate of Edinburgh; the north respond bears the arms of Alexander Napier of Merchiston, Provost of Edinburgh.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii pp. 430-433. Choir aisles Of the two choir aisles, the north is only two thirds the width of the south aisle, which contained the Lady Chapel prior to the Reformation.Fawcett 1994, p. 187. Richard Fawcett suggests this indicates that both choir aisles were rebuilt after 1385. In both aisles, the curvature of the spandrels between the ribs gives the effect of a dome in each bay.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 109-110. The ribs appear to serve a structural purpose; however, the lack of any intersection between the lateral and longitudinal cells of each bay means that these vaults are effectively pointed barrel vaults.Hannah 1934, p. 159.Fawcett 2002, p. 231. Having been added as part of the mid-15th century extension, the eastern bays of both aisles contain proper lateral cells. The north wall of the north choir aisle contains a 15th-century tomb recess; in this wall, a grotesque, which may date to the 12th century church, has been re-set. At the east end of the south aisle is a stone staircase added by Bernard Feilden and Simpson & Brown in 1981‚Äì82. The Chambers Aisle stands north of the westernmost bay of the north choir aisle. This chapel was created in 1889-91 by MacGibbon and Ross as a memorial to William Chambers. This Aisle stands on the site of the medieval vestry, which, at the Reformation, was converted to the Town Clerk's office before being restored to its original use by William Burn.MacGibbon and Ross 1896, ii p. 443. MacGibbon and Ross removed the wall between the vestry and the church and inserted a new arch and vaulted ceiling, both of which incorporate medieval masonry.Marshall 2009, p. 145. The Preston Aisle stands south of the western three bays of the south choir aisle. It is named for William Preston of Gorton, who donated Saint Giles' arm-bone to the church; Preston's arms recur in the bosses and capitals of the chapel.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 110-111. The town council began the Aisle's construction in 1455, undertaking to complete it within seven years; however, the presence in the Aisle of a boss bearing the arms of Lord Hailes, Provost of Edinburgh in the 1480s, suggests construction took significantly longer. The Aisle's tierceron vault and pillars are similar to those in the 15th century extension of the choir. The pillars and capitals also bear a strong resemblance to those between the inner and outer south nave aisles.RCAHMS 1951, p. 33. The Chepman Aisle extends south of the westernmost bay of the Preston Aisle. The Aisle was founded by Walter Chepman; permission for construction was granted in 1507 and consecration took place in 1513. The ceiling of the Aisle is a pointed barrel vault whose central boss depicts an angel bearing Chepman's arms impaled with those of his first wife, Mariota Kerkettill. The Aisle was divided into three storeys during the Burn restoration then restored in 1888 under the direction of Robert Rowand Anderson.Hay 1976, p. 250. Stained glass St Giles' is glazed with 19th and 20th century stained glass by a diverse array of artists and manufacturers. Between 2001 and 2005, the church's stained glass was restored by the Stained Glass Design Partnership of Kilmaurs.Marshall 2009, pp. 189-190. Fragments of the medieval stained glass were discovered in the 1980s: none was obviously pictorial and some may have been grisaille. A pre-Reformation window depicting an elephant and the emblem of the Incorporation of Hammermen survived in the St Eloi Aisle until the 19th century.Lees 1889, p. 96. References to the removal of the stained glass windows after the Reformation are unclear.Lees 1889, pp. 363, 367. A scheme of coloured glass was considered as early as 1830: three decades before the first new coloured glass in a Church of Scotland building was installed at Greyfriars Kirk in 1857; however, the plan was rejected by the town council.Steele 1993, p. 8. Victorian windows Jesus ascends into heaven in the east window by Ballantine & Son (1877). Most windows in St Giles' are by the Ballantine firm. By the 1860s, attitudes to stained glass had liberalised within Scottish Presbyterianism and the insertion of new windows was a key component of William Chambers' plan to restore St Giles'. The firm of James Ballantine was commissioned to produce a sequence depicting the life of Christ, as suggested by the artists Robert Herdman and Joseph Noel Paton. This sequence commences with a window of 1874 in the north choir aisle and climaxes in the great east window of 1877, depicting the Crucifixion and Ascension.Marshall 2009, p. 126.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 116. Other windows by Ballantine & Son are the Prodigal Son window in the south wall of the south nave aisle; the west window of the Albany Aisle, depicting the parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins and the parable of the talents (1876); and the west window of the Preston Aisle, depicting Saint Paul (1881).Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 116-7. Ballantine & Son are also responsible for the window of the Holy Blood Aisle, depicting the assassination and funeral of the Regent Moray (1881): this is the only window of the church that depicts events from Scottish history.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 117.Marshall 2009, p. 128.Kallus 2010, p. 19. Andrew Ballantine produced the west window in the south wall of the inner south nave aisle (1886): this depicts scenes from the life of Moses. The subsequent generation of the Ballantine firm, Ballantine & Gardiner, produced windows depicting the first Pentecost (1895) and Saint Peter (1895‚Äì1900) in the Preston Aisle; David and Jonathan in the east window of the south side of the outer south nave aisle (1900‚Äì01); Joseph in the east window of the south wall of the inner south nave aisle (1898); and, in the windows of the Chambers Aisle, Solomon's construction of the Temple (1892) and scenes from the life of John the Baptist (1894). The Joshua window by Edward Burne- Jones (1886) Multiple generations of the Ballantine firm executed heraldic windows in the oriel window of the outer south nave aisle (1883) and in the clerestory of the choir (1877‚Äì92): the latter series depicts the arms of the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh. David Small is responsible for the easternmost window of the north side of the clerestory (1879). Ballantine & Son also produced the window of the Chepman Aisle, showing the arms of notable 17th century Royalists (1888); in the St Eloi Aisle, the Glass Stainers' Company produced a companion window, showing the arms of notable Covenanters (1895).Marshall 2009, p. 144. Daniel Cottier designed the east window of the north side of the north nave aisle, depicting the Christian virtues (1890). Cottier also designed the great west window, now-replaced, depicting the Prophets (1886).Marshall 2009, p. 143.Kallus 2009, p. 35. Edward Burne-Jones designed the window in the west wall of the north nave aisle (1886). This was produced by Morris & Co. and shows Joshua and the Israelites in the upper section with Jephthah's daughter, Miriam, and Ruth in the lower section. Other stained glass artists of the Victorian era represented in St Giles' are Burlison & Grylls, who executed the Patriarchs window in the west wall of the inner south nave aisle and Charles Eamer Kempe, who created the west window of the south side of the outer south nave aisle: this depicts biblical writers. 20th century windows Detail of the north transept window by Douglas Strachan (1922) Oscar Paterson is responsible for the west window of the north side of the north nave aisle (1906): this shows saints associated with St Giles'. Karl Parsons designed the west window of the south side of the south choir aisle (1913): this depicts saints associated with Scotland. Douglas Strachan is responsible for the windows of the choir clerestory that depict saints (1932‚Äì35) and for the north transept window (1922): this shows Christ walking on water and stilling the Sea of Galilee, alongside golden angels subduing demons that represent the four winds of the earth.Kallus 2010, p. 23. Windows of the later 20th century include a window in the north transept clerestory by William Wilson, depicting Saint Andrew (1954), and the east window of the Albany Aisle, on the theme of John the Divine, designed by Francis Spear and painted by Arthur Pearce (1957).Marshall 2009, p. 163.Kallus 2009, p. 34. The most significant recent window is the great west window, a memorial to Robert Burns (1985). This was designed by Leifur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞ to replace the Cottier window of 1886, the glass of which had failed.Marshall 2009, pp. 184-186.Kallus 2009, p. 46. A scheme of coloured glass, designed by Christian Shaw, was installed in the south transept behind the organ in 1991. Memorials arms of Edinburgh from a medieval plaque in the Preston Aisle There are over a hundred memorials in St. Giles'; most date from the 19th century onwards.Marshall 2011, p. vi. In the medieval period, the floor of St Giles' was paved with memorial stones and brasses; these were gradually cleared after the Reformation.Marshall 2011, p. 1. At the Burn restoration of 1829‚Äì33, most post-Reformation memorials were destroyed; fragments were removed to Culter Mains and Swanston.RCAHMS 1951, p. 34. The installation of memorials to notable Scots was an important component of William Chambers' plans to make St Giles' the \\"Westminster Abbey of Scotland\\". To this end, a management board was set up in 1880 to supervise the installation of new monuments; it continued in this function until 2000.Marshall 2011, p. 2. All the memorials were conserved between 2008 and 2009. Ancient memorials Regent Moray's monument Medieval tomb recesses survive in the Preston Aisle, Holy Blood Aisle, Albany Aisle, and north choir aisle; alongside these, fragments of memorial stones have been re-incorporated into the east wall of the Preston Aisle: these include a memorial to \\"Johannes Touris de Innerleith\\" and a carving of the coat of arms of Edinburgh. A memorial brass to the Regent Moray is situated on his monument in the Holy Blood Aisle. The plaque depicts female personifications of Justice and Religion flanking the Regent's arms and an inscription by George Buchanan. The plaque was inscribed by James Gray on the rear of a fragment of a late 15th century memorial brass: a fibreglass replica of this side of the brass is installed on the opposite wall.Marshall 2011, p. 72. The plaque was originally set in a monument of 1570 by Murdoch Walker and John Ryotell: this was destroyed at the Burn restoration but the plaque was saved and reinstated in 1864, when John Stuart, 12th Earl of Moray commissioned David Cousin to design a replica of his ancestor's memorial. A memorial tablet in the basement vestry commemorates John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl, who was buried in the Chepman Aisle in 1579. A plaque commemorating the Napiers of Merchiston is located on the north exterior wall of the choir. This was likely installed on the south side of the church by Archibald Napier, 1st Lord Napier in 1637; it was moved to its present location during the Burn restoration.  Victorian and Edwardian memorials Most memorials installed between the Burn restoration of 1829-33 and the Chambers restoration of 1872-83 are now located in the north transept: these include white marble tablets commemorating Major General Robert Henry Dick (died 1846); Patrick Robertson, Lord Robertson (died 1855); and Aglionby Ross Carson (1856).Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 115.Marshall 2011, pp. 33-35. The largest of these memorials is a massive plaque surmounted by an urn designed by David Bryce to commemorate George Lorimer, Dean of Guild and hero of the 1865 Theatre Royal fire (1867).Marshall 2011, p. 36. 1879 memorial to Walter Chepman by Francis Skidmore Memorial to Jenny Geddes (1885) William Chambers, who funded the restoration of 1872‚Äì83, commissioned the memorial plaque to Walter Chepman in the Chepman Aisle (1879): this was designed by William Hay and produced by Francis Skidmore.Marshall 2011, pp. 70-71. Chambers himself is commemorated by a large plaque in a red marble frame (1894): located in the Chambers Aisle, this was designed by David MacGibbon with the bronze plaque produced by Hamilton and Inches.Marshall 2009, p. 46. William Hay, the architect who oversaw the restoration (died 1888), is commemorated by a plaque in the north transept vestibule with a relief portrait by John Rhind.Marshall 2011, pp. 37-38. The first memorial installed after the Chambers restoration was a brass plaque dedicated to Dean James Hannay, the cleric whose reading of Charles I's Scottish Prayer Book in 1637 sparked rioting (1882).Marshall 2011, p. 83. In response, and John Stuart Blackie and Robert Halliday Gunning supported a monument to Jenny Geddes, who, according to tradition, threw a stool at Hannay. An 1885 plaque on the floor between south nave aisles now marks the putative spot of Geddes' action.Marshall 2011, p. 86. Other historical figures commemorated by plaques of this period include Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray (1893); Robert Leighton (1883); Gavin Douglas (1883); Alexander Henderson (1883); William Carstares (1884); and John Craig (1883), and James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount Stair (1906).Marshall 2011, pp. 31-32, 71, 80-83, 85. Detail of the memorial to Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll (1895) The largest memorials of this period are the Jacobean-style monuments to James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose in the Chepman Aisle (1888) and to his rival, Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, in the St Eloi Aisle (1895); both are executed in alabaster and marble and take the form of aedicules in which lie life-size effigies of their dedicatees. The Montrose monument was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson and carved by John and William Birnie Rhind. The Argyll monument, funded by Robert Halliday Gunning, was designed by Sydney Mitchell and carved by Charles McBride.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 115-116.Marshall 2011, pp. 30, 68. Other prominent memorials of this period include the Jacobean-style plaque on the south wall of the south choir aisle, commemorating John Inglis, Lord Glencorse and designed by Robert Rowand Anderson (1892); the memorial to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (died 1881) in the Preston Aisle, including a relief portrait by Mary Grant; and the large bronze relief of Robert Louis Stevenson by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the west wall of the Moray Aisle (1904). A life-size bronze statue of John Knox by James Pittendrigh MacGillivray (1906) stands in the north nave aisle. This initially stood in a Gothic niche in the east wall of the Albany Aisle; the niche was removed in 1951 and between 1965 and 1983, the statue stood outside the church, in Parliament Square.Marshall 2009, pp. 145, 159, 163, 176. Augustus Saint-Gaudens' memorial to Robert Louis Stevenson (1906) 20th and 21st century memorials In the north choir aisle, the bronze plaque commemorating Sophia Jex-Blake (died 1912) and the stone plaque to James Nicoll Ogilvie (1928) were designed by Robert Lorimer.Marshall 2011, pp. 40, 50. Lorimer himself is commemorated by a large stone plaque in the Preston Aisle (1932): this was designed by Alexander Paterson.Marshall 2011, p. 67. A number of plaques in the \\"Writers' Corner\\" in the Moray Aisle incorporate relief portraits of their dedicatees: these include memorials to Robert Fergusson (1927) and Margaret Oliphant (1908), sculpted by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray; John Brown (1924), sculpted by Pilkington Jackson; and John Stuart Blackie (died 1895) and Thomas Chalmers (died 1847), designed by Robert Lorimer.Marshall 2011, pp. 73-74, 76. Further relief portrait plaques commemorate Robert Inches (1922) in the former session house and William Smith (1929) in the Chambers Aisle; the former was sculpted by Henry Snell Gamley.Marshall 2011, pp. 24, 42. Pilkington Jackson executed a pair of bronze relief portraits in pedimented Hopton Wood stone frames to commemorate Cameron Lees (1931) and Wallace Williamson (1936): these flank the entrance to the Thistle Chapel in the south choir aisle. Memorial to Sophia Jex-Blake designed by Robert Lorimer Modern sculptures include the memorial to Wellesley Bailey in the south choir aisle, designed by James Simpson (1987) and Merilyn Smith's bronze sculpture of a stool in the south nave aisle, commemorating Jenny Geddes (1992).Marshall 2009, pp. 62, 86-87. The most recent memorials are plaques by Kindersley Cardozo Workshop of Cambridge commemorating James Young Simpson (1997) and Ronald Colville, 2nd Baron Clydesmuir (2003) in the Moray Aisle and marking the 500th anniversary of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in the north choir aisle (2005).Marshall 2011, pp. 58, 76-77. Military Memorials Victorian Victorian military memorials are concentrated at the west end of the church. The oldest military memorial is John Steell's memorial to members of the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot killed by disease in Sindh between 1844 and 1845 (1850): this white marble tablet contains a relief of a mourning woman and is located on the west wall of the nave.Marshall 2011, p. 92. Nearby is the second-oldest military memorial, William Brodie's Indian Rebellion of 1857 memorial for the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (1864): this depicts, in white marble, two Highland soldiers flanking a tomb.Marshall 2011, p. 90. The Royal Scots Greys' Sudan memorial by John Rhind (1886) John Rhind sculpted the Royal Scots Greys' Sudan memorial (1886): a large brass Celtic cross on grey marble. John Rhind and William Birnie Rhind sculpted the Highland Light Infantry's Second Boer War memorial: a marble-framed brass plaque. William Birnie Rhind and Thomas Duncan Rhind sculpted the Royal Scots 1st Battalion's Second Boer War memorial: a bronze relief within a pedimented marble frame (1903); WS Black designed the Royal Scots 3rd Battalion's Second Boer War memorial: a portrait marble plaque surmounted by an angel flanked by obelisks.Marshall 2011, pp. 6, 8, 18, 87-88. World Wars The congregation's First World War memorial by Henry Snell Gamley (1926) The Elsie Inglis memorial in the north choir aisle was designed by Frank Mears and sculpted in rose-tinted French stone and slate by Pilkington Jackson (1922): it depicts the angels of Faith, Hope, and Love.Marshall 2011, p. 56. Jackson also executed the Royal Scots 5th Battalion's Gallipoli Campaign memorial - bronze with a marble tablet (1921) - and the 16th (McCrae's) Battalion's First World War memorial, showing Saint Michael and sculpted in Portland stone: this was designed by Robert Lorimer, who also designed the bronze memorial plaque to the Royal Army Medical Corps in the north choir aisle.Marshall 2011, pp. 15, 52, 87-90. Individual victims of the war commemorated in St Giles' include Neil Primrose (1918) and Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet (1917). Ministers and students of the Church of Scotland and United Free Church of Scotland are commemorated by a large oak panel at the east end of the north nave aisle by Messrs Begg and Lorne Campbell (1920).Marshall 2011, pp. 48, 61, 84-85. Henry Snell Gamley is responsible for the congregation's First World War memorial (1926): located in the Albany Aisle, this consists of a large bronze relief of an angel crowning the \\"spirit of a soldier\\", its green marble tablet names the 99 members of the congregation killed in the conflict.Marshall 2011, pp. 11-12. Gamley is also responsible for the nearby white marble and bronze tablet to Scottish soldiers killed in France (1920); the Royal Scots 9th Battalion's white marble memorial in the south nave aisle (1921); and the bronze relief portrait memorial to Edward Maxwell Salvesen in the north choir aisle (1918).Marshall 2011, pp. 13-14, 52, 89-90. The names of 38 members of the congregation killed in the Second World War are inscribed on tablets designed by Esm√© Gordon within a medieval tomb recess in the Albany Aisle: these were unveiled at the dedication of the Albany Aisle as a war memorial chapel in 1951. As part of this memorial, a cross with panels by Elizabeth Dempster was mounted on the east wall of the Aisle. Other notable memorials of the Second World War include Basil Spence's large wooden plaque to the 94th (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (1954) in the north choir aisle and the nearby Church of Scotland chaplains memorial (1950): this depicts Saint Andrew in bronze relief and was manufactured by Charles Henshaw. Features Prior to the Reformation, St Giles' was furnished with as many as fifty stone subsidiary altars, each with their own furnishings and plate. The Dean of Guild's accounts from the 16th century also indicate the church possessed an Easter sepulchre, sacrament house, rood loft, lectern, pulpit, wooden chandeliers, and choir stalls.RCAHMS 1951, p. 28. At the Reformation, the interior was stripped and a new pulpit at the east side of the crossing became the church's focal point. Seating was installed for children and the burgh's council and trade guilds and a stool of penitence was added. After the Reformation, St Giles' was gradually partitioned into smaller churches. At the church's restoration by William Hay in 1872‚Äì83, the last post-Reformation internal partitions were removed and the church was oriented to face the communion table at the east end; the nave was furnished with chairs and the choir with stalls; a low railing separated the nave from the choir. The Buildings of Scotland series described this arrangement as \\"High Presbyterian (Low Anglican)\\". Most of the church's furnishings date from this restoration onwards. From 1982, the church was reoriented with seats in the choir and nave facing a central communion table under the crossing. Furniture Pulpits, tables, and font The pulpit dates to 1883 and was carved in Caen stone and green marble by John Rhind to a design by William Hay. The pulpit is octagonal with relief panels depicting the acts of mercy.Marshall 2009, pp. 123-124. An octagonal oak pulpit of 1888 with a tall steepled canopy stands in the Moray Aisle: this was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson. St Giles' possessed a wooden pulpit prior to the Reformation. In April 1560, this was replaced with a wooden pulpit with two locking doors, likely located at the east side of the crossing; a lectern was also installed.Marshall 2009, pp. 52-53. A brass eagle lectern stands on the south side of the crossing: this was given by an anonymous couple for use in the Moray Aisle.Marshall 2009, p. 183. The bronze lectern steps were sculpted by Jacqueline Gruber Steiger and donated in 1991 by the Normandy Veterans' Association.Marshall 2009, p. 188. Until 1982, a Caen stone lectern, designed by William Hay stood opposite the pulpit at the west end of the choir.Marshall 2009, p. 124. Situated in the crossing, the communion table is a Carrara marble block unveiled in 2011: it was donated by Roger Lindsay and designed by Luke Hughes. This replaced a wooden table in use since 1982. The plain communion table used after the Chambers restoration was donated to the West Parish Church of Stirling in 1910 and replaced by an oak communion table designed by Robert Lorimer and executed by Nathaniel Grieve. The table displays painted carvings of the Lamb of God, Saint Giles, and angels; it was lengthened in 1953 by Scott Morton & Co. and now stands in the Preston Aisle.Marshall 2009, pp. 151-152. The Albany Aisle contains a neo-Jacobean communion table by Whytock and Reid, which was installed at the time of the Aisle's dedication as a war memorial chapel in 1951.Marshall 2009, p. 159. A small communion table with Celtic knot and floral designs was added to the Preston Aisle in 2019; this was designed by Sheanna Ashton and made by Grassmarket Furniture. The eagle lectern (1886) and steps by Jacqueline Gruber Steiger (1991) The communion table and reredos of the Chambers Aisle were designed by Robert Lorimer and John Fraser Matthew in 1927‚Äì29. The reredos contains a relief of the adoration of the infant Christ by angels: this is the work of Morris and Alice Meredith Williams. In 1931, Matthew designed a reredos and communion table for the Moray Aisle; these were removed in 1981 and later sold to the National Museum of Scotland.Marshall 2009, pp. 157, 177. A reredos in the form of a Gothic arcade stood at the east end of the church from the Chambers restoration; this was designed by William Hay and executed in Caen stone with green marble pillars. In 1953, this was replaced with a fabric reredos, designed by Esm√© Gordon. The Gordon reredos was removed in 1971; the east wall is now bare.Marshall 2009, pp. 124, 159, 167. Font by John Rhind The Caen stone font by John Rhind is in the form of a kneeling angel holding a scallop; the font is an exact replica of Bertel Thorvaldsen's font for the Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen. Initially, it stood near the pulpit before being moved to the west end of the south nave aisle; between 1916 and 1951, it stood in the Albany Aisle; it was then moved to near the west door and has stood in the north choir aisle since 2015. Seating Since 2003, new chairs, many of which bear small brass plaques naming donors, have replaced chairs of the 1880s by West and Collier throughout the church.Marshall 2009, pp. 135-136, 189. Two banks of choir stalls in a semi-circular arrangement occupy the south transept; these were installed by Whytock & Reid in 1984. Whytock & Reid also provided box pews for the nave in 1985; these have since been removed. In 1552, prior to the Reformation, Andrew Mansioun executed the south bank of choir stalls; the north bank were likely imported. In 1559, at the outset of the Scottish Reformation, these were removed to the Tolbooth for safe-keeping; they may have been re-used to furnish the church after the Reformation. The royal pew There has been a royal loft or pew in St Giles' since the regency of Mary of Guise. Standing between the south choir aisle and Preston Aisle, the current monarch's seat possess a tall back and canopy, on which stand the royal arms of Scotland; this oak seat and desk were created in 1953 to designs of Esm√© Gordon and incorporate elements of the former royal pew of 1885 by William Hay. Hay's royal pew stood in the Preston Aisle; it replaced an oak royal pew of 1873, also designed by Hay and executed by John Taylor & Son: this was re- purposed as an internal west porch and was removed in 2008. Metalwork, lighting, and plate The gates and railings of the Albany Aisle, the St Eloi Aisle, the Holy Blood Aisle, and the Chepman Aisle are the work of Francis Skidmore and date from the Chambers restoration. Skidmore also produced the chancel railing ‚Äì now removed ‚Äì and the iron screens at the east end of the north choir aisle: these originally surrounded the Moray Aisle.Marshall 2009, p. 177. The gates and font bracket in the Chambers Aisle are by Thomas Hadden and date from the aisle's designation as the Chapel of Youth in 1927‚Äì29. The west door is surrounded by a metal and blue glass screen of 2008 by Leifur Brei√∞fj√∂r√∞. The church is lit by stainless steel and aluminium chandeliers as well as by concealed strip lights below the windows. The chandeliers are designed to evoke lilies and were produced between 2007 and 2008 by Lighting Design Partnership near Edinburgh; they replaced a concealed lighting system of 1958.Marshall 2009, pp. 163, 190-191. In 1882, during the Chambers restoration, Francis Skidmore provided a set of gas chandeliers based on a chandelier in St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol.Marshall 2009, p. 136. Electric lighting was installed in 1911 and Robert Lorimer designed new electric chandeliers; at their removal in 1958, some of these were donated to St John's Kirk, Perth and Cleish Church.Marshall 2009, pp. 154, 163. A red glass \\"Lamp of Remembrance\\" by Thomas Hadden hangs in the Albany Aisle: its steel frame imitates St Giles' crown steeple. A lamp with stained glass panels by Douglas Strachan hangs in the Chambers Aisle. Plate in possession of the church includes four communion cups dated 1643 and two flagons dated 1618 and given by George Montaigne, then Bishop of Lincoln. Among the church's silver are two plates dated 1643 and a ewer dated 1609.Dunlop 1988, pp. 46-45. Clocks and bells The current clock was manufactured by James Ritchie and installed in 1911; this replaced a clock of 1721 by Langley Bradley of London, which is now housed in the Museum of Edinburgh.Marshall 2009, pp. 103, 154. A clock is recorded in 1491. Between 1585 and 1721, the former clock of Lindores Abbey was used in St Giles'. HMS Howe The hour bell of the cathedral was cast in 1846 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, possibly from the metal of the medieval Great Bell, which had been taken down about 1774. The Great Bell was cast in Flanders in 1460 by John and William Hoerhen and bore the arms of Guelderland and an image of the Virgin and Child. Robert Maxwell cast the second bell in 1706 and the third in 1728: these chime the quarters, the latter bears the coat of arms of Edinburgh. Between 1700 and 1890, a carillon of 23 bells, manufactured in 1698 and 1699 by John Meikle, hung in the tower.Lees 1889, p. 252. Daniel Defoe, who visited Edinburgh in 1727, praised the bells but added \\"they are heard much better at a distance than near at hand\\".Defoe in Lees 1889, p. 254. In 1955, an anonymous elder donated one of the carillon's bells: it hangs in a Gothic wooden frame next to the Chambers Aisle.Marshall 2009, p. 100. Nearby hangs the bell of HMS Howe: this was presented in 1955 by the Admiralty to mark the ship's connection to Edinburgh. The bell hangs in a frame topped by a naval crown: this was made from Howe's deck timbers.Kallus 2009, p. 21. The vesper bell of 1464 stands in the south nave aisle. Flags and heraldry arms of George II by Roderick Chalmers (1736) From 1883, regimental colours were hung in the nave. In 1982, the Scottish Command of the British Army offered to catalogue and preserve the colours. The colours were removed from the nave and 29 were reinstated in the Moray Aisle. Since 1953, the banners of the current Knights of the Thistle have hung in the Preston Aisle, near the entrance to the Thistle Chapel.Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 69. The banner of Douglas Haig hangs in the Chambers Aisle; this was donated in 1928 by Lady Haig after her husband's lying-in-state in St Giles'. A large wooden panel, showing the arms of George II hangs on the tower wall above at the west end of the choir: this is dated 1736 and was painted by Roderick Chalmers. The Fetternear Banner, the only surviving religious banner from pre-Reformation Scotland, was made around 1520 for the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, which had its altar in the Lauder Aisle. The banner, which depicts the wounded Christ and the instruments of His passion, is held by the National Museum of Scotland. National Covenant St Giles' possesses one of the original copies of Scotland's National Covenant of 1638. The copy in St Giles' was signed by leading Covenanters, including James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose; John Leslie, 6th Earl of Rothes; and John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. The Covenant remained in the possession of the family of the Laird of Dundas until 1924, when it was purchased by Alexander Wallace and donated to St Giles' in 1926. It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle. Thistle Chapel The interior of the Thistle Chapel, looking west Located at the south-east corner of St Giles', the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the Order of the Thistle; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 118. At the foundation of the Order of the Thistle in 1687, James VII ordered Holyrood Abbey be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At James' deposition the following year, a mob destroyed the chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven donated ¬£24,000 from their late father's estate, Edward VII ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 9-10. The Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the chapel's construction appointed Robert Lorimer as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish Arts and Crafts movement, including Phoebe Anna Traquair for enamelwork, Douglas Strachan for stained glass, Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. Louis Davis ‚Äì who supplied stained glass ‚Äì and the Bromsgrove Guild ‚Äì who supplied bronze fittings ‚Äì were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, George V knighted Lorimer for his work.Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 11. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, crests, and banners for new knights, the chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year. Architectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of Gothic architecture, rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the chapel's importance as a product of the Arts and Crafts movement, in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, British imperialism, and monarchism. Worship Services and liturgy St Giles' holds four services every Sunday: * 8 am: Communion * 10 am: Communion * 11.30 am: Morning Service * 8 pm: Evening Services At 6 pm on Sunday, St Giles' also hosts a programme of music. Every day apart from Sunday, a service is held at 12 noon; a communion service is also held on Fridays at 8 am. Prior to the Reformation, St Giles' used the Sarum Use, with High Mass being celebrated at the High Altar and Low Mass celebrated at the subsidiary altars. After the Reformation, services were conducted according to the Book of Common Order; unaccompanied congregation singing of the Psalms replaced choral and organ music and preaching replaced the Mass as the central focus of worship; public penance was also introduced.Marshall 2009, pp. 57-58.Lees 1889, p. 139. Communion services were initially held three times a year; the congregation sat around trestle tables: a practice that continued until the 1870s.Marshall 2009, pp. 61-63, 140. The attempted replacement of the Book of Common Order by a Scottish version of the Book of Common Prayer on 23 July 1637 sparked rioting, which led to the signing of the National Covenant.Marshall 2009, pp. 81-87. From 1646, the Directory for Public Worship was used. During the Commonwealth, the Directory fell out of use; public penance, psalm-singing, and Bible readings were removed from the service and lay preaching was introduced.Lees 1889, pp. 224-225. Between 1648 and 1655, the ministers withheld communion in protest.Marshall 2009, p. 94. During the second imposition of episcopacy under Charles II and James VII the liturgy reverted to its post-Reformation form and there was no attempt to bring it into line with the practice of the Church of England. By the beginning of the 18th century, the services of the Book of Common Order had been replaced by extempore prayers.Lees 1889, pp. 235, 248. Cameron Lees, minister between 1877 and 1911, was a leading figure in the liturgical revival among Scottish Presbyterian churches in the latter half of the 19th century. Lees used the Church Service Society's Euchologion for communion services and compiled the St Giles' Book of Common Order: this directed daily and Sunday services between 1884 and 1926.Maxwell 1955, p. 181. Under Lees, Christmas, Easter, and Watchnight services were introduced. With financial support from John Ritchie Findlay, daily service was also introduced for the first time since the Commonwealth.Marshall 2009, pp. 139-140. Lees' successor, Andrew Wallace Williamson continued this revival and revised the St Giles' Book of Common Order. A weekly communion service was introduced by Williamson's successor, Charles Warr.Maxwell 1955, pp. 181-182. The current pattern of four Sunday services, including two communions, was adopted in 1983 during the incumbency of Gilleasbuig Macmillan.Marshall 2009, p. 181. Macmillan introduced a number of changes to communion services, including the practice of communicants' gathering round the central communion table and passing elements to each other.Marshall 2009, p. 169-170. Notable services Charles Warr, Minister of St Giles' (right), accompanies the Duke of York (middle) on Remembrance Sunday, 1933. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has hosted regular and occasional services of civic and national significance. Important annual services held in St Giles include the Edinburgh's civic Remembrance Sunday service, the Kirking of the council for the city council, the Kirking of the Courts for the legal profession, the Thistle Service for the Knights of the Thistle; and a service during the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.McIlwain 1994, p. 27. The Kirking of the Parliament has been held in St Giles' at the opening of every new session of the Scottish Parliament since the Parliament's foundation in 1999; this revives an earlier service for the Parliament of Scotland.Marshall 2009, pp. 191-192. St Giles' has also long enjoyed a close connection with the Scottish then British royal families; the royal Knights of Thistle, including the Queen as Sovereign of the Order, attend the Thistle service in St Giles' every second year. Since the regency of Mary of Guise, there has been a royal pew or loft in St Giles'.Marshall 2009, p. 41. Notable services for the royal family include the Requiem Mass for James I (1437); the service to welcome Anne of Denmark to Scotland (1590); divine service during the visit of George IV (1822); and Elizabeth II's receipt of the Honours of Scotland (1953).Marshall 2009, pp. 24, 71-72, 111-12, 160. Significant occasional services in St Giles' include the memorial Mass for the dead of Flodden (1513); thanksgivings for the Scottish Reformation (1560), the Union (1707), and Victory in Europe Day (1945); and the service to mark the opening of the first Edinburgh International Festival (1947).Lees 1889, p. 246.Marshall 2009, pp. 50, 158.Marshall 2009, p. 191. Recent occasional services have marked the return to Scotland of the Stone of Scone (1996) and the opening of the National Museum of Scotland (1998); a service of reconciliation after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum was also held in St Giles'. St Giles' hosted the lyings-in-state of Elsie Inglis (1917) and Douglas Haig (1928).Marshall 2009, pp. 153, 156. Notable recent funerals include those of Robin Cook (2005) and John Bellany (2013). Notable recent weddings include the marriage of Chris Hoy to Sarra Kemp (2010). Choir St Giles' Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir of 30 adults, directed by the Master of Music, Michael Harris. The Choir sings at the 10 am Communion and 11.30 am morning services on Sundays. The Choir first toured internationally, to the US, in 2004 and has since toured frequently in Europe and North America. The Choir has also appeared in television and radio broadcasts, including Choral Evensong, and has released recordings on its own label, Aegidius. The current Choir was founded in 1879.Marshall 2009, p. 140. This revived a tradition of choral music at St Giles': until the Reformation, a song school was attached to St Giles' where four official choristers were educated alongside other boys. The song school fell into disrepair after the departure of its master, John Fethy, in 1551; however, Edward Henderson oversaw its restoration in the years immediately preceding the Reformation.Marshall 2009, p. 37 After the Reformation, Henderson continued to teach music there as well as leading the unaccompanied congregational singing of psalms.Marshall 2009, p. 55. Pipe organ The pipe organ, built by Rieger Orgelbau and dedicated in 1992 The pipe organ was completed in 1992 and is located in the south transept: it was made by Rieger Orgelbau and donated by Alastair Salvesen. Douglas Laird designed the case: it imitates the prow of a ship and uses red-stained Austrian oak along with decorative bronze and glass features. The organ has 4,156 pipes, most of which are tin. The Glocken is a ring of 37 bells made by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.Marshall 2009, p. 187. The current organ replaced a Harrison & Harrison organ of 1878, the first organ in the church since the Reformation. This organ initially possessed 2 manuals and 26 stops. Between 1872 and this organ's installation, a harmonium was used in services. Harrison & Harrison rebuilt the organ in 1883 and 1887. Eustace Ingram rebuilt the organ as a 4 manual, 60 stop instrument in 1895. Ingram & Co rebuilt the organ in 1909 and overhauled it between 1936 and 1939. The organ was reconstructed in 1940 by Henry Willis & Sons as a 4 manual, 74 stop instrument with a new console and an extra console in the Moray Aisle; a new case was designed by Esm√© Gordon: this incorporated statues of angels and Jubal by Elizabeth Dempster.Marshall 2009, p. 158. The second console was removed in 1980 and Willis overhauled the organ in 1982. The organ was removed in 1990, some of the pipes were removed to the McEwan Hall, Peebles Old Parish Church, and the Scottish Theatre Organ Preservation Trust; two were incorporated in the replacement organ; the console was donated to a church in Perth.Marshall 2009, pp. 186-187. Since 1996, Michael Harris has served as organist and Master of Music; he is assisted by Jordan English. Since the insertion of the first post-Reformation organ in 1878, the following people have served as organist of St Giles': * 1878‚Äì1923: John Hartley * 1923‚Äì1944: Wilfrid Greenhouse Allt * 1946‚Äì1996: Herrick Bunney * 1996‚Äìpresent: Michael HarrisMarshall 2009, pp. 157, 183, 187. Ministry Clergy Alexander Webster preaches in the Tolbooth Kirk in a 1785 caricature by John Kay. The current minister of St Giles' is Calum MacLeod, who was translated from Fourth Presbyterian Church, Chicago in 2014; he replaced Gilleasbuig Macmillan, who was appointed minister in 1973 and retired in 2013. The assistant minister is Craig Meek. From Cameron Lees to Gilleasbuig Macmillan, every minister of St Giles' served as Dean of the Thistle; Lees and his two successors, Andrew Wallace Williamson and Charles Warr, also served as Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland.Dunlop 1988, pp. 51-52. In 1980, Helen Alexander was appointed assistant minister, becoming the first woman to minister in St Giles'.Marshall 2009, p. 170. Alongside the minister, St Giles' has a Kirk Session of around 50 elders. The first vicar of St Giles' recorded by name is John, who appended his name to a charter of Holyrood Abbey in 1241.Lees 1889, p. 3. Three successive vicars of St Giles' in the 15th century ‚Äì John Methven, Nicholas Otterbourne, and Thomas Bully ‚Äì were noted churchmen who also held senior positions in the Scottish royal court.Lees 1889, pp. 6-27. In 1467, a bull of Pope Paul II made St Giles' a collegiate church and replaced the role of vicar with a provost accompanied by a curate and sixteen canons. William Forbes, the last vicar of St Giles' was promoted as its first provost. Forbes was succeeded by Gavin Douglas, who completed his Middle Scots translation of Virgil's Aeneid, Eneados, in 1513 while provost. In 1559, John Knox, leader of the Scottish Reformation became the first Protestant minister of St Giles', serving intermittently until his death in 1572. Knox's successors were influential in opposing the religious reforms of James VI. Though St Giles' had been partitioned into smaller churches, ministers were only allocated to specific churches after the division of Edinburgh into parishes in 1598. Between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1689, St Giles' served as the seat of the Bishop of Edinburgh and was served by a Dean and prebendaries. Notable ministers in St Giles' during the 18th century include the influential Covenanter and Whig, William Carstares; the evangelical preacher, Alexander Webster; and Hugh Blair, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment.Marshall 2009, pp. 105-106.Dunlop 1988, p. 45. Parish and historic congregations The current parish of St Giles' (or the High Kirk) covers a portion of Edinburgh's Old Town bounded by the railway, George IV Bridge, the Cowgate, and St Mary's Street. Between 1641 and 1929, the High Kirk's parish covered the north side of the High Street.Dunlop 1988, p. 47. From the medieval period until 1598, St Giles' parish covered the entire burgh of Edinburgh. Prior to the Reformation, St Giles' was within the Deanery of Linlithgow in the Archdiocese of St Andrews. A map of 1877, showing the New North, Old, and High divisions prior to the Chambers restoration Between 1561 and 1564, the west of the nave was partitioned: the upper floor served as a place of worship and the ground floor served as an extension to the Tolbooth. Around 1581, the choir was partitioned off to create the New or East Kirk, leaving the crossing, transepts, and the remainder of the nave to form Middle St Giles' or the Old or Great Kirk.Dunlop 1988, pp. 16-17. Edinburgh's ministers alternated freely between these churches until 1598, when the Privy Council of Scotland ordered the following division of Edinburgh into four parishes, each with two ministers: * North East: Trinity College Kirk * South East: Old (or Great) St Giles' * South West: Upper Tolbooth (St Giles') * North West: New (or East or Little) St Giles' In 1620, the South West congregation moved to the newly built Greyfriars Kirk; the Upper Tolbooth partition remained unoccupied until 1634. In 1625, the Privy Council ordered the following rearrangement of these divisions; it is not, however, clear whether this was ever enforced: * North East: Trinity College Kirk * South East: East (or New) St Giles' * South West: Greyfriars Kirk * North West: Great (or Old) St Giles' In 1633, St Giles' became a cathedral and the partition between the Old and New Kirks was removed, the South East congregation moved to Upper Tolbooth, then occupied the Old Kirk between 1639 and 1647, when it moved to the Tron Kirk; during this period, the Old Kirk congregation occupied Parliament Hall.Dunlop 1988, pp. 17, 24. In 1641, a division of Edinburgh into six parishes was made; the following parishes were allocated to St Giles': * North: New (or High or East) St Giles' * North West: Tolbooth (or West) St Giles' * South: Old (or Middle) St Giles' In 1699, the congregation of the New North Meeting House on the Lawnmarket occupied the northern half of the Tolbooth partition, after which it was named \\"Haddo's Hole Kirk\\". The Tolbooth Kirk vacated St Giles' in 1843; the Old Kirk was suppressed in 1860 and the Haddo's Hole congregation ‚Äì by then known as West St Giles' ‚Äì vacated St Giles' in 1881 to allow the removal of the internal partitions. Since 1883, the High Kirk congregation has occupied the entire church.Dunlop 1988, p. 257. Cultural depictions The real-life escape of condemned smuggler, George Robertson, from the Tolbooth Kirk during divine service in 1736 is fictionalised in The Heart of Midlothian by Walter Scott (1818).Lees 1889, pp. 249-251. St Giles' is referenced twice in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark (1961): first as a location the title character and her \\"set\\" of pupils pass by on a walk around Edinburgh and again as one of the \\"emblems of a dark and terrible salvation\\" contemplated by the protagonist, Sandy Stranger.Spark 1961, pp. 35, 108. In Disorderly Knights (1966), the fourth book of Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles series, the protagonist, Sir Francis Crawford of Lymond, swears an oath in the Lauder Aisle of St Giles' and duels with Sir Graham Reid Malett on the steps of the church's High Altar. In Avengers: Infinity War (2018), St Giles' features as one of the locations of a fight between the heroes and Thanos' Black Order. The scenes were filmed around the cathedral in spring 2017.

Cha chaan teng locations are commonly found in Hong Kong, Macau, and parts of Guangdong. Due to the waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong in the 1980s, they were established in major Chinese communities in Western countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The caf√©s are known for eclectic and affordable menus, which include dishes from Hong Kong cuisine and Hong Kong-style Western cuisine.Beerman, Jason \\"Cha chaan teng cheat sheet: What to order at the most popular eateries in Hong Kong\\" CNN Go. 20 February 2012.

History Since the 1850s, Western cuisine was only found in Hong Kong from full-service restaurants. They were then a privilege limited for the upper class, and financially out of reach for most working class locals. In the 1920s, dining in a Western restaurant could cost up to $10, while a working local earned $15 to $50 per month..(December 2018). Titbits Through Time. Chinese Culinary Institute & International Culinary Institute. After the Second World War, Hong Kong culture was influenced by British culture. Hong Kong people started to like adding milk to tea and eating cakes. Therefore, some Hongkongers set up cha chaan tengs that targeted a local audience.. (28 December 2007).

Name and description The name, literally \\"tea restaurant\\", serves to distinguish the restaurants from Western restaurants that provide water to customers instead of tea. Cha chaan teng establishments provide tea (usually weak tea) called \\"clear tea\\" (Ê∏ÖËå∂ cing1 caa4), to customers as soon as they are seated. (Some patrons use this hot tea to wash their utensils, a common custom in Hong Kong.) The \\"tea\\" in the name refers to this inexpensive black tea, which differs from the traditional Chinese tea served in traditional dim sum restaurants and teahouses (Ëå∂Ê®ì). The \\"tea\\" may also refer to tea drinks, such as the Hong Kong-style milk tea and iced lemon tea, which are served in many cha chaan tengs. The older generations in Hong Kong refer to dining in these restaurants as yum sai cha (È£≤Ë•øËå∂; lit: \\"drinking Western tea\\"), in contrast with the going yum cha. Some cha chaan tengs adopt the word \\"caf√©\\" in their names. This is especially the case when located in English speaking countries where they are commonly known as \\"Hong Kong‚Äìstyle cafes\\" and are instead best known for their serving of yuenyeung and Hong Kong‚Äìstyle (condensed milk) coffee. Culture Table sharing etiquette sign in a Cha chaan teng (Hong Kong) Fast service and high efficiency Usually, tea restaurants have high customer turnover, at 10‚Äì20 minutes for a sitting. Customers typically receive their dishes after five minutes. The waiters take the order with their left hand and pass the dishes with their right hand. This embodies Hong Kong's hectic lifestyle. During peak periods, long queues form outside many restaurants. Long working hours The staff in a cha chaan teng work long hours, sometimes also night shifts. Trend Because of the limited land and expensive rent, cha chaan tengs are gradually being replaced by chain restaurants, such as Caf√© de Coral, Maxim's and Fairwood. As chain restaurants dominate the market, Hong Kong's cha chaan teng culture is disappearing. They are however increasing in popularity overseas with many opening up in Cantonese diaspora communities as a casual alternative to more traditional Chinese Restaurants.CNN TravelHistory of Cha Chaan Teng ‚Äì Yahoo Knowledge HKwalker  Common phrases and abbreviations  To speed up the ordering process, waiters use a range of abbreviations when writing down orders. * The character Âèç (spoken as faan, meaning \\"opposite\\") is used to represent ÁôΩÈ£Ø (, meaning \\"white rice\\"). * \\"0T\\" stands for lemon tea (0 reads as ling, which is phonetically similar to the first word of lemon (Ê™∏) which is ning and phonetically identical to how most Hong Kong people now pronounce Ê™∏.

A big cha chaan teng often consists of three cooking places: a \\"water bar\\" (Ê∞¥Âêß) which makes drinks, toast/sandwiches and instant noodles; a \\"noodle stall\\" which prepares Chiuchow-style noodles (including wonton noodles); and a kitchen for producing rice plates and other more expensive dishes. Food and drinks Soup macaroni in Hong Kong Drinks The invention of drinks like yuenyeung (È¥õÈ¥¶), iced tea with lemon (ÂáçÊ™∏Ëå∂) and Coca-Cola with lemon (Ê™∏Ê®Ç) is often credited culturally to this style of restaurant. *Coffee: Two types exist: instant and in powder form, the latter being more common. Often served with condensed milk, especially overseas. *Black coffee: Hong Kong people usually called them jaai fea (lit. \\"vegetarian coffee\\" / \\"just coffee\\", emphasising on its plain texture) or \\"fei sha jaau naai\\" (lit. \\"get rid of sand and milk\\", i.e. coffee without sugar (the \\"sand\\") and milk) *Hong Kong-style milk tea: A highly popular drink in Hong Kong.

Snacks *Toast: This includes toast with condensed milk and butter/peanut butter, toast with jam and butter, toast with butter in a sliced form, and French Toast *Sandwich: Sandwiches found in Cha Chaan Tengs usually include egg, ham, corned beef or a mixture of any as a filling. Club Sandwiches are also very common. A difference between the sandwiches found in Cha Chaan Tengs, and other eateries would be that only white bread is used, the customer has the option of omitting the crust of the bread, and requesting that the bread be toasted before making their sandwich. *Egg tart *Hong Kong-style buns: Includes pineapple buns (with or without a slab of butter inside), cocktail buns, Satay beef buns, barbecued pork buns, etc. *Spring rolls Fried dishes *Various Fried rice and noodles dishes *Hong Kong-style spaghetti bolognese *Fried instant noodles *Beef chow fun Soup dishes *Instant or udon noodles in soup *Macaroni in soup *Soup noodles with fish balls, wontons and the like Miscellaneous dishes *Barbecued Pork (Char siu): Not found in all cha chaan tengs. *Congee and yau ja gwei, a Chinese fritter. Set meals A feature found in cha chaan tengs are set meals. There are various sets available throughout the day for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. The lunch and dinner sets usually include a soup and a drink. Generally there is an additional HK$2-3 charge for cold drinks. Sometimes an additional HK$5 is charged for toasting the bread (ÁÉòÂ∫ï). Other sets include: * \\"Nutritious set\\" (ÁáüÈ§äÈ§ê) ‚Äì It comes with milk and other nutritional food * \\"Constant set\\" (Â∏∏È§ê) ‚Äì Provided all day long, hence the name (it usually consists of a main course, omelette, wheat foodstuff, white bread with butter and a drink) The wheat food stuff always comes with different choices such as spiced pork cubes, salted vegetable with sliced pork or luncheon meat etc. * \\"Fast set\\" (Âø´È§ê) ‚Äì Immediately served (usually rice with sausages/ ham/ fried eggs with gravy) * \\"Special set\\" (ÁâπÈ§ê) ‚Äì Chef's (or Boss's) recommendation Tables and seats Generally, the tables in cha chaan tengs are square for 4 people, or round for 6 to 8 people. For each table, there is a piece of glass that covers the top and some menus are placed between the table and glass. During lunch or dinner, customers are sometimes requested to \\"daap toi\\" (ÊíòÊû±), meaning they share a table with other customers, who are already seated before. This helps save space, provide waiting guests with seats faster, and give customers in a hurry a seat.  Hygiene  Before 2007, most cha chaan tengs allowed people to smoke, and some waiters would even smoke when working. Since 1 January 2007, Hong Kong Law prohibits smoking within the indoor premises of restaurants.  Interiors and utensils  Much of the plastic-ware found on the table is provided by beverage companies, which is a form of advertising. This plastic-ware includes containers holding toothpicks, plastic menu holders, etc. Brands like Ovaltine, Horlicks and Ribena are the usual providers. To minimise costs, cha chaan tengs also rarely have utensils that bear their own brand name. As a result, the same utensils can be found in many different cha chaan tengs, even different chains. These utensils can be bought in supermarkets, department stores, and stores specializing in restaurant supplies. Walls and floors in cha chaan tengs are often tiled, because they are easier to clean (especially in the humid summer weather in a city like Hong Kong). Variations Other kinds of local restaurant related to cha chaan teng in Hong Kong include chaan sutt (È§êÂÆ§; lit. \\"meal chamber\\"), bing sutt (ÂÜ∞ÂÆ§; lit. \\"ice chamber\\"), and bing teng (ÂÜ∞Âª≥; lit. \\"ice dining room\\"), which provide a lighter and more limited selection of food than cha chaan teng. In the old days, these eateries only sold different types of \\"ice\\", sandwiches and pasta but no rice plates. However, some of the restaurants bearing these titles today ignore the tradition, and provide all kinds of rice plates and even wonton noodles. Original chaan sutts, bing sutts and bing tengs, which can be regarded as the prototype of cha chaan tengs, are now scarce in Hong Kong. In June 2009, Hong Kong retail design store G.O.D. collaborated with Starbucks and created a store with a \\"Bing Sutt Corner\\" at their store on Duddell Street. It is a concept that fuses the retro Hong Kong teahouse, style with the contemporary look of a coffeehouse.Starbucks with Traditional Hong Kong Style In media and popular culture *The similarities between the different set meals were satirised by My life as McDull, a McDull movie. *An important part of Hong Kong culture, cha chaan teng is featured in many Hong Kong movies and TV dramas: Featured in popular sitcom Virtues of Harmony, a TVB-made soap opera tells the story of a family who runs a cha chaan teng, usually boasting the egg tart and \\"silk-stocking milk tea\\" produced by them. Stephen Chow played a cha chaan teng waiter in the 1998 comedy The Lucky Guy (Ë°åÈÅã‰∏ÄÊ¢ùÈæç), and a cha chaan teng meal-delivery-boy in King of Comedy (1999). *Some beverage companies put the term cha chaan teng on their products, such as \\"cha chaan teng milk tea\\" and \\"cha chaan teng lemon tea\\". *On 19 December 2007, lawmaker Choy So Yuk proposed during a legislative council session that Hong Kong's cha chaan teng be recognised and put up to UNESCO as an \\"intangible cultural heritage of humanity\\". The proposal came about after a recent Hong Kong poll found that seven out of ten people believe the cafes deserve a UNESCO cultural listing.

As a variational method, DMRG is an efficient algorithm that attempts to find the lowest-energy matrix product state wavefunction of a Hamiltonian. It was invented in 1992 by Steven R. White and it is nowadays the most efficient method for 1-dimensional systems. The idea behind DMRG The main problem of quantum many-body physics is the fact that the Hilbert space grows exponentially with size. For example, a spin-1/2 chain of length L has 2L degrees of freedom. The DMRG is an iterative, variational method that reduces effective degrees of freedom to those most important for a target state. The target state is often the ground state. After a warmup cycle, the method splits the system into two subsystems, or blocks, which need not have equal sizes, and two sites in between. A set of representative states has been chosen for the block during the warmup. This set of left block + two sites + right block is known as the superblock. Now a candidate for the ground state of the superblock, which is a reduced version of the full system, may be found. It may have a rather poor accuracy, but the method is iterative and improves with the steps below. Decomposition of the system into left and right blocks, according to DMRG. The candidate ground state that has been found is projected into the Hilbert subspace for each block using a density matrix, hence the name. Thus, the relevant states for each block are updated. Now one of the blocks grows at the expense of the other and the procedure is repeated. When the growing block reaches maximum size, the other starts to grow in its place. Each time we return to the original (equal sizes) situation, we say that a sweep has been completed. Normally, a few sweeps are enough to get a precision of a part in 1010 for a 1D lattice. The DMRG sweep. The first application of the DMRG, by Steven White and Reinhard Noack, was a toy model: to find the spectrum of a spin 0 particle in a 1D box. This model had been proposed by Kenneth G. Wilson as a test for any new renormalization group method, because they all happened to fail with this simple problem. The DMRG overcame the problems of previous renormalization group methods by connecting two blocks with the two sites in the middle rather than just adding a single site to a block at each step as well as by using the density matrix to identify the most important states to be kept at the end of each step. After succeeding with the toy model, the DMRG method was tried with success on the Heisenberg model (quantum). Technical details about the implementation A practical implementation of the DMRG algorithm is a lengthy work. A few of the main computational tricks are these: * The ground state for the superblock is obtained using the Lanczos algorithm of matrix diagonalization. Another choice is the Arnoldi method, especially when dealing with non-hermitian matrices. * The Lanczos algorithm usually starts with the best guess of the solution. If no guess is available a random vector is chosen. In DMRG, the ground state obtained in a certain DMRG step, suitably transformed, is a reasonable guess and thus works significantly better than a random starting vector at the next DMRG step. * In systems with symmetries, we may have conserved quantum numbers, such as total spin in a Heisenberg model (quantum). It is convenient to find the ground state within each of the sectors into which the Hilbert space is divided. *An example: dmrg of Heisenberg model Applications The DMRG has been successfully applied to get the low energy properties of spin chains: Ising model in a transverse field, Heisenberg model, etc., fermionic systems, such as the Hubbard model, problems with impurities such as the Kondo effect, boson systems, and the physics of quantum dots joined with quantum wires. It has been also extended to work on tree graphs, and has found applications in the study of dendrimers. For 2D systems with one of the dimensions much larger than the other DMRG is also accurate, and has proved useful in the study of ladders. The method has been extended to study equilibrium statistical physics in 2D, and to analyze non-equilibrium phenomena in 1D. The DMRG has also been applied to the field of Quantum Chemistry to study strongly correlated systems. The matrix product ansatz The success of the DMRG for 1D systems is related to the fact that it is a variational method within the space of matrix product states. These are states of the form : \\\\sum_{s_1\\\\cdots s_N} \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A^{s_1}\\\\cdots A^{s_N}) s_1 \\\\cdots s_N\\\\rangle where s_1\\\\cdots s_N are the values of the e.g. z-component of the spin in a spin chain, and the Asi are matrices of arbitrary dimension m. As m ‚Üí ‚àû, the representation becomes exact. This theory was exposed by S. Rommer and S. Ostlund in . Extensions of DMRG In 2004 the time-evolving block decimation method was developed to implement real time evolution of Matrix Product States. The idea is based on the classical simulation of a quantum computer. Subsequently, a new method was devised to compute real time evolution within the DMRG formalism - See the paper by A. Feiguin and S.R. White . In recent years, some proposals to extend the method to 2D and 3D have been put forward, extending the definition of the Matrix Product States. See this paper by F.

The title character is a fairy whose adventures span the fantasy and real worlds. McEldowney also creates the syndicated comic strip 9 Chickweed Lane, occasionally crossing over to Pibgorn, which explores stronger themes of sexuality and violence.  Publication history  Origins Pibgorn slowly evolved over the years after McEldowney had begun 9 Chickweed Lane, wherein Edda would occasionally have flights of fancy where she appeared as a prototype Pibgorn on rare occasions. He finally started adapting the idea into a proposed spin-off entitled The Titans, which was rejected by syndicate editors, in 2000. These proposed strips and accompanying sketches were presented on the Pibgorn website in 2005 during one of McEldowney's hiatuses from the strip. Titans would have been a gag-a-day format strip, in which Pibgorn (named Oola Inch here), disenchanted with her expected role as a fairy, usually would break away from her regular routine to wax philosophical. Unfortunately, Oola was also one of life's losers, her dialogues often resulting in misfortune, such as having a magic 8-ball roll over her, or nearly being eaten by whatever animal she's conversing with (a spider, a duckling, etc.). The strips also showed a darker side to her character, as in addition to managing dewdrops, her responsibilities include serving as the \\"voices-in-my-head\\" of disgruntled government employees, driving one to attempted homicide on at least one occasion. The final set of proposal strips showed Oola running afoul of Prince Crewth and Gaggot, here named Prince Grabstein and Rhune, when she petitions to leave \\"dewdrop brigade\\" and become a stand-up comedian. Unable to tell if she's laughing with him or at him, Grabstein outlaws laughter altogether and sets Luciano after Oola, only for the fly to fall in love with her. These situations were later recycled as part of the early Pibgorn story arcs. Format Geoff, Pibgorn, and Drusilla exit a nightclub in the beginning of the story, \\"Mozart and The Demon Lover.\\" Until April 18, 2007, Pibgorn was published on internet by United Feature Syndicate on their Comics.com website. It has also been published as a graphic novel, Pibgorn: The Girl in the Coffee Cup, which was released in October 2006. Other releases include A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Poltergeist in the Piano, and The Borgia Cantus. Possibly because of graphic novel considerations, Pibgorn is characterized by involved story arcs which may seem better suited to a graphic novel than a daily comic, and it is also notable for its creative use of color and large format, together with strong themes of violence (explicit) and sexuality (generally implicit), attributes not usually associated with daily print comics. The artist has made the point that he wants to create a story without worrying about the editors of family newspapers. Pibgorn originally ran daily Monday through Saturday, but on February 8, 2006, it was announced that beginning on February 13, the strip would run only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It ended its run on Comics.com on April 18, 2007, and resumed with GoComics.com on May 14, 2007. McEldowney stated the burden of writing two daily strips concurrently as the reason for the cutback. As of July 14, 2008, the strip began running 5 days a week, Monday through Friday; McEldowney indicated in his blog that despite time constraints, he wanted the story to move along at a brisker pace.  Discontinuation from Comics.com On April 17, 2007, United Feature Syndicate announced through Comics.com that Pibgorn would be discontinued on the following day. Brooke McEldowney has indicated that United Feature Syndicate accommodated his request to be released from his contract in order to secure a new online home for Pibgorn. From a letter from Brooke McEldowney to his readers: > With United Media‚Äôs announcement that ‚ÄúPibgorn‚Äù is to be discontinued, I > have been inundated with e-mail, much of it agitated and distressed.

For example, in the August 22, 2008 strip, Geoff is seen walking down the street, nude, with his bare buttocks on display. Return of Pibgorn Pibgorn returned to the Web on May 14, 2007, at gocomics.com, owned by Universal Press Syndicate. Continuing in its three- per-week format, the interrupted story arc was presented from the start so as not to confuse new readers. In late 2015 Pibgorn switched to presenting an older series of WAHOO TERMINAL comics, which continued through September, 2016. Afterwards, Pibgorn returned to its earlier story arc, but on an intermittent basis while presenting some experimental styles. On August 17, 2017, McEldowney posted a note on Pibgorn‚Äôs Gocomics page, explaining that he was still recovering from a stroke, and that in the meantime, there would be a rerun of the storyline ‚ÄúPibgorn and the Djinn of It,‚Äù which began four days later, on August 21.

She's sweet, effervescent, charming and flighty, with a succubus for a best friend and a human for a sweetheart. She has a talent for trouble, a knack for friendship, and a magical kiss ‚Äî the baiser de la f√©e, or \\"fairy's kiss,\\" ‚Äî which can effect miraculous healing or change the size of herself and others. She is drawn as a lithe young woman with simultaneously red and blonde hair, and insect-like wings growing from her back. She is neither clothed nor nude; her body is covered with varying shades of green, which McEldowney describes as being \\"dappled\\". She can however wrap her wings around her body, transforming into clothes. * Drusilla: A rather manipulative succubus who is used to getting what she wants, she seems to have resigned herself to the fact that Geoff genuinely loves Pib rather than her. She has made it clear, though, that if Pib hurts Geoff, Dru will make her sorry. Their relationship has developed into an alliance bordering on friendship. Like Pibgorn, her body is \\"dappled\\", covered with shades of magenta and violet, but arranged to bare more, accentuating her bosom and navel. She has black hair, which she often wears in long tresses to cover her ears, which are stag-horn in shape, indicative of her status as a demon. *Geoff (surname unknown): Pib's slightly geeky sweetheart, he's a former church organist and now Pib's and Drusilla's accompanist, having been ostracized from the community when Drusilla accidentally revealed her true identity to the local pastor. He is loyal and affectionate, and protective of those he cares about. Not a stereotypical swashbuckling hero type, Geoff nevertheless has consistently shown bravery in order to help save Pibgorn and others around him from danger. He is also getting better acquainted with the supernatural world and has on occasion been able to guesstimate a solution. He apparently holds a great interest in musical history, as he‚Äôs shown a surprising amount of biographical knowledge about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. *Oognat: The hair fairy‚Äînot as bold or adventurous as Pibgorn, Oognat nonetheless ends up in many of the same difficulties as her companion fairy. *Thorax: Possibly a visitor from another galaxy, a guest character from 9 Chickweed Lane. *Maurice: A field mouse, he's been a friend of Pib's from the beginning, and he tries valiantly to keep up and help where he can. When last seen, he‚Äôd apparently become the companion of a Humphrey Bogart-influenced ex-demon. *Prince Crewth: The fairy monarch who was exasperated enough by Pib's flouting of the rules (the last of which he invented against some action Pib had already done and made it retroactively effective) to order her assassination. Whenever he reappears in a strip, it's usually to re-authorize her termination for some perfectly senseless reason, although he's often side-tracked by the appearance of Drusilla or some other, more intimidating presence. Indolent and proud of it, he is mind-numbingly bureaucratic and blind to the repercussions of his actions. He is drawn as a miniature satyr with a resemblance to former U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. *Gaggot: Prince Crewth's oily lawyer/doctor, who seems to fancy himself as something of a power behind the throne, easily able to lead the prince around by the nose. Despite this, he often finds himself serving as Crewth‚Äôs right-hand man in the various tasks set upon them by Drusilla and others, which inevitably results in physical harm to both of them. Because of this, his patience with his monarch would appear to be wearing thin. He is drawn as a standard fictional wizard or vizier, wearing robes and a long, grey beard. He is the most human-looking fairy to appear in the strip, without insect wings or goat-legs, and could pass for a miniature human. *Luciano: a horsefly who is Prince Crewth's consultant and sometime court assassin, whose only weakness appears to be Pib. He proves to be completely unable to bring himself to hurt her, and instead falls head over heels. *Henmellyn: Drusilla's daughter. She first appears on January 19, 2004, and subsequently \\"dies.\\" She does not reappear until March 24, 2011, as a pawn in the hands of the demon Stan, who uses her to draw Drusilla to him. *Stan: a hypermasculine satyr, half-goat, half-human, much in the image of the Greek god Pan. He appears in a storyline that started in the Pibgorn strip for March 24, 2011, with the reappearance of Drusilla's daughter all but drowned in a pool of lava in Hell. He is cruel, violent, extremely powerful, and seems bent on Drusilla's destruction, which he seems to accomplish in the strips for May 16‚Äì19, 2011. As of May 20, 2011, we learn that his plot involves Geoff in some way. (All of the above strips can be accessed using the date search functions at http://www.gocomics.com/pibgorn.) *Nat Bustard: A detective who constantly narrates his actions, reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart films. Storylines Pibgorn has completed 13 distinct adventures to date, and has begun another. The story arcs are as follows, named as McEldowney conceived them: *The Girl in the Coffee Cup (initially started on comics.com, then restarted February 19, 2002; the strip changed to color on March 11, the earliest strip in the GoComics.com archive). Pibgorn the fairy meets and falls in love with Geoff, to the annoyance of his girlfriend Drusilla, who Geoff learns is a succubus demon in human form. *The Poltergeist in the Piano (started November 11, 2002). About midway through this story, McEldowney switched from a daily newspaper strip format to a larger format. *The Borgia Cantus (started August 11, 2003). This story introduces Nat Bustard. *Drusilla's Daughter (started January 17, 2004) *The Internal Fairy Harvesting Service (started October 18, 2004). Oognat makes her first appearance. This story introduced Thorax from 9 Chickweed Lane as a recurring character in later story arcs. *Mozart and the Demon Lover (started May 23, 2005, repeated with commentary starting November 9, 2011). Geoff and Mozart switch places in time. Geoff struggles to finish Mozart's Requiem while Thorax helps Mozart understand what is happening. *A Pibsummer Night's Dream (started February 13, 2006) presents the Pibgorn Players, along with the cast of 9 Chickweed Lane, performing William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream against a 1930s backdrop √† la Guys and Dolls. *Lena the Horrible (started March 21, 2007). This is the longest story arc, running for two years with over 400 strips. It takes place inside a computer-generated world created by a demon. *Pibgorn and the Volcano on 77th Street and Park Avenue40¬∞46‚Ä≤27.55‚Ä≥N, 73¬∞57‚Ä≤41.32‚Ä≥W (started March 17, 2009) *The Stone Coin (started November 23, 2009) is a departure from the canon characters and is instead an illustrated story that McEldowney wrote in 1988. *Pibgorn and the Graveyard Shift (started January 21, 2010). Drusilla enters a repressed memory from Pibgorn's past that affects her actions in the present. *Pibgorn and the Brunch with Death (started December 27, 2010) *Pibgorn and The Djinn of It (started September 17, 2012) *Romeo and Juliet (started July 29, 2013) presents the Pibgorn Players, along with a few cast members from 9 Chickweed Lane, performing William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in its traditional setting with many 1920s references. *Guy le Pain: Le Pain Guy (started November 19, 2014) *Wahoo Terminal (started November 28, 2015): McEldowney revisits one of his early attempts at a syndicated strip that was ultimately rejected. *Luda and Ut, or The Provenance of Pib (started January 14, 2019) References External links * Pibgorn at GoComics.com Category:American comedy webcomics Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:Webcomics in print Category:Fictional fairies and sprites Category:2000s webcomics Category:2002 webcomic debuts ","title":"Pibgorn (webcomic)"},{"id":"564538","text":"Bandi may refer to: People with the name * Bandi (writer), North Korean fiction writer, born 1950 * Bandi Yadagiri, Indian revolutionary poet * Philipp Bandi (born 1977), Swiss track and field athlete Other uses * Gbandi (or Bandi), people of Liberia and Guinea  Gbandi language (or Bandi), a Mande language spoken by that people * Bandi River, a tributary of the Luni River * Bandi (jacket), a vest-jacket worn in South Asia * Bandi (Star Trek), a fictional race in Star Trek See also * Bandai (disambiguation) * Bandhi, a town of Shaheed Benazir Abad District of Sindh, Pakistan * Bandi Atmakur, a village and a Mandal in Kurnool district in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India * Bandy (disambiguation) Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Bandi"},{"id":"564544","text":"Maximum time in grade in a military force is the longest amount of time that an officer or enlisted man is allowed to remain in the service without being promoted.

The store has never left its site on Princes Street, but its original building was destroyed by fire in 1892.

He is best remembered for his operas Loreley (1890) and La Wally (1892). La Wally was composed to a libretto by Luigi Illica, and features Catalani's most famous aria \\"Ebben? Ne andr√≤ lontana.\\" This aria, sung by American soprano Wilhelmenia Fernandez, was at the heart of Jean- Jacques Beineix's 1981 film Diva. Catalani's other operas were much less successful. Life and career thumb Born in Lucca, Catalani was trained at the Milan Conservatory, where his teachers included Antonio Bazzini. Despite the growing influence of the verismo style of opera during the 1880s and early 1890s, Catalani chose to compose in a more traditional manner, which had traces of Wagner in it. As a result, his operas (La Wally excepted) have largely lost their place in the modern repertoire, even compared to those of Massenet and Puccini, whose style his own periodically resembles. (Catalani much resented Puccini's emergence and even accused Puccini, falsely, of plagiarism.) The influence of Amilcare Ponchielli can also be recognized in Catalani's output. Catalani's reputation, like Ponchielli's, now rests almost entirely on one work. However, while La Wally enjoys occasional revivals, Ponchielli's La Gioconda has always been the more popular opera of the two (287 performances to date at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, as opposed to only four for La Wally). In 1893, upon his premature death from tuberculosis in Milan, Catalani was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale, where Ponchielli and conductor Arturo Toscanini also lie. A passionate admirer of Catalani's music, Toscanini even named one of his daughters Wally. Toscanini recorded the prelude to Act IV of La Wally and the \\"Dance of the Water Nymphs\\" from Loreley in Carnegie Hall in August 1952 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor. Almost 90 years after his death, in 1981, his work was highlighted by the release of Diva, a thriller directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix which employed the aria from La Wally.

He attended a private boarding school near Middleburg, Virginia run by a Scottish Presbyterian clergyman. He attended Washington College (now known as Washington and Jefferson College) in Washington County, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1819. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in Virginia and maintained a successful private practice in Fauquier, Loudoun, and Rappahannock counties. In October, 1834, Horner married Harriet L. Watson, the daughter of James Watson, U.S. Senator from New York. Fond du Lac History-John Scott Horner Political career On August 15, 1835, President Andrew Jackson appointed Horner to be Secretary (and acting Governor) of the Michigan Territory, replacing the popular Stevens T. Mason. The circumspect Horner knew he was entering office in a volatile situation. Michigan had satisfied all the requirements set out in the Northwest Ordinance to become a state, however the U.S. Congress had repeatedly rejected or ignored Michigan's petition for statehood. The rejection was related to two very contentious issues: # There was an acrimonious border dispute with the state of Ohio, which became known as the Toledo War. # Southern slave states were reluctant to increase the number of northern free states. right Jackson, facing reelection in 1836, did not want to alienate Ohio, with its many electoral votes. So he removed the popular Mason from office. Mason was agitating for statehood and was, at that time, unyielding in demands regarding the Toledo Strip. At Mason's urging, Michigan had drafted a constitution on its own without the sanction of an Enabling Act from Congress. The people adopted the constitution in October 1835 and at the same time elected Mason as governor along with a full slate of state officials (the state government was not recognized by Congress until 1837, when Michigan became a state). So Horner had to appease irate Ohioans as well as deal with an unauthorized, but popular local government that undermined his own authority as Territorial Governor. Horner was at least partially successful, in that he helped to avert violence (aside from some minor scuffles) and persuaded both parties to wait for the upcoming session of Congress to propose a resolution. Despite heading alternate governments, there was little disagreement between Mason and Horner, with Horner mostly staying out of the way in local politics. In August 1835, while Michigan prepared itself for statehood, Mason had separated all of the territory which was not going to be part of the state into a separate jurisdiction in order to provide some continuity in governance. Horner had replaced Mason as Territorial Secretary in the interim and was to assume responsibility for the western territory. But he was delayed for various reasons and the western area had its own government for a time without any official representative of the federal government. Congress organized the Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836 and Horner assumed the office of Secretary, leaving the de facto, if unrecognized, government of the state of Michigan to Mason.History of Wisconsin - Chapter 2 - Wisconsin as a Territory As Secretary of the Wisconsin Territory, Horner's first acts were to administer the oaths of office to Governor Henry Dodge and the judges of the supreme court with Charles Dunn as chief justice, and William C. Frazer and David Irvin as associate justices. In June 1837, Jackson transferred Horner to the become Register of the Green Bay Land Office. Horner resisted requests by friends and relatives to move back east to Virginia, and in 1847, Horner moved to a farm on the south shore of Green Lake in present- day Green Lake County. In 1849, he was elected probate judge for Marquette County (which then included Green Lake County). He held this office until the court was abolished in 1854. Horner's house in Ripon, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the John Scott Horner House. Later life Horner was one of the original settlers of the present day city of Ripon, Wisconsin.The History of Ripon Wisconsin In 1851, Horner also helped establish Ripon College.Biographical Profiles, Ripon College His former home, now known as the John Scott Horner House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Death Horner died in Ripon in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, at the age of eighty. He is interred at Hillside Cemetery, Ripon, Wisconsin. Family life He married Harriet L. Watson (1805‚Äì1883) in October 1834, who died two months after him in Ripon.

Pajeau, who formed the Toy Tinker Company in Evanston, Illinois to manufacture them. Pajeau, a stonemason, designed the toy after seeing children play with sticks and empty spools of thread. Pajeau partnered with Robert Pettit and Gordon Tinker to market a toy that would allow and inspire children to use their imaginations. After an initially slow start, over a million were sold. The cornerstone of the set is a wooden spool roughly two inches (5 cm) in diameter, with holes drilled every 45 degrees around the perimeter and one through the center. Unlike the center, the perimeter holes do not go all the way through. With the differing-length sticks, the set was intended to be based on the Pythagorean progressive right triangle. The sets were introduced to the public through displays in and around Chicago which included model Ferris wheels. Tinkertoys have been used to create complex machines, including Danny Hillis's tic-tac-toe-playing computer (now in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California) and a robot at Cornell University in 1998. One of Tinkertoy‚Äôs distinctive features is the toy‚Äôs packaging. Initially, the mailing tube design was chosen to reduce shipping costs. Early versions of the packaging included an address label on the tube with space for postage. To assist consumers in differentiating between the various offerings, sets were placed in mail tube packages of different sizes and also delineated with a number (e.g.: 116, 136) and a name (e.g.: major, prep, big boy, junior, grad). A colorful \\"how-to\\" instruction guide accompanied each set. In the 1950s, color was added and the wooden sticks appeared in red, green, blue, and yellow. The main manufacturing location was a 65,000-square-foot four-story plant at 2012 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois. Tinkertoys were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1998. Hasbro owns the Tinkertoy brand and currently produces both Tinkertoy Plastic and Tinkertoy Classic (wood) sets and parts. Standard parts In addition to the spools, a standard Tinkertoy set includes: *Wheels, which are thinner than spools, but larger in diameter. Like spools, their center holes have a snug fit. *Caps, originally wooden, but later plastic, cylindrical pieces with a single blind axial hole snugly fitted to the rods. *Couplings, small cylindrical pieces (originally wood; later plastic) approximately 2 inches long and half an inch in diameter, with snug-fitting blind-drilled holes in either end, and a loose- fitting through-drilled hole crosswise through the center of the part. *Pulleys, identical to spools, except that the center holes are loose-fitting. *\\"Part W\\", approximately the same size and shape as a spool, but with perimeter holes 90 degrees apart, loose-fitting center holes, and four tight- fitting through-drilled holes parallel to the center hole. This allows for free-spinning parts, and also for construction of \\"cage\\" or \\"lantern\\" gears. *Short pointed sticks (originally wood, but later plastic), typically red, and flags (\\"fan blades,\\") typically green plastic, and various other small parts. Spools and pulleys all have a single groove around the outside; \\"Part W\\" has two parallel grooves. Sticks (or \\"rods\\") are slotted on each end, both to provide some \\"give\\" when inserted into snug-fitting holes, and to allow thin cards, flags, and strings to be inserted into the slots. They are color-coded by size; in the 1960s-era sets, they were, in order from shortest to longest, orange, yellow, blue, red, green, and violet. Each successively longer rod is (with allowances for the size of the spools) next smaller size times the square root of two; thus any two of the same size will combine with one of the next size up, and three spools, to form an isosceles right triangle (45¬∞‚Äì45¬∞‚Äì90¬∞). Tinkertoy sticks before 1992 were made with a diameter of 0.25 inch. The earlier sets had natural wood sticks, but changed to colored sticks in the late 1950s. From measurement, the orange sticks are 1.25 inches long; yellow, 2.15; blue, 3.35; red, 5.05; green, 7.40; and, purple, 10.85. Spools are 1.35 inches in diameter with holes of 0.30 inch depth. Most of the larger sets also include a driveshaft (an unfinished wooden rod without slotted ends, of an intermediate length between \\"green\\" and \\"violet,\\" normally turned with a small plastic crank. The Ultra Construction Set also includes connectors, small cylindrical plastic pieces approximately 2 inches long with a slot in either end and a slotted hole crosswise through the center of the part. Sets with battery-powered electric motors were available; these sets also typically included at least one wooden \\"double pulley,\\" with a single snug-fitting through-drilled center hole, and grooved rims at two diameters, allowing different moving parts to operate at different speeds.

From the outset the family's wealth has been under the complete control of the male members of the dynasty, through the family office. Despite strong-willed wives who had influence over their husbands' decisions‚Äîsuch as the pivotal female figure Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr.‚Äîin all cases they received allowances only and were never given even partial responsibility for the family fortune.Women in the family with no control over the family fortune‚Äîsee Bernice Kert, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: The Woman in the Family. New York: Random House, 1993. (p.100) Much of the wealth has been locked up in the notable family trust of 1934 (which holds the bulk of the fortune and matures on the death of the fourth generation) and the trust of 1952, both administered by Chase Bank, the corporate successor to Chase Manhattan Bank. These trusts have consisted of shares in the successor companies to Standard Oil and other diversified investments, as well as the family's considerable real estate holdings. They are administered by a trust committee that oversees the fortune. Management of this fortune today also rests with professional money managers who oversee the principal holding company, Rockefeller Financial Services, which controls all the family's investments, now that Rockefeller Center is no longer owned by the family. The present chairman is David Rockefeller Jr. In 1992, it had five main arms: *Rockefeller & Co. (Money management: Universities have invested some of their endowments in this company); * Venrock Associates (Venture Capital: an early investment in Apple Computer was one of many it made in Silicon Valley entrepreneurial start-ups); *Rockefeller Trust Company (Manages hundreds of family trusts); *Rockefeller Insurance Company (Manages liability insurance for family members); *Acadia Risk Management (Insurance Broker: Contracts out policies for the family's vast art collections, real estate and private planes.)Managing the family wealth, 1992 New York Times article Rockefeller Family Tries to Keep A Vast Fortune From Dissipating (see External Links).

The result, in 1951, was the six-building apartment complex known as Morningside Gardens.The Morningside Heights housing project - see David Rockefeller, Memoirs, New York: Random House, 2002. (pp.385-87). * Senior's donations led to the formation of the University of Chicago in 1889; the Central Philippine University in the Philippines (The first Baptist university and second American university in Asia); and notable for the Chicago School of Economics. This was one instance of a long family and Rockefeller Foundation tradition of financially supporting Ivy League and other major colleges and universities over the generations‚Äîseventy-five in total. These include:  Harvard University  Dartmouth College  Princeton University  University of California, Berkeley  Stanford University  Yale University  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Brown University  Tufts University  Columbia University  Cornell University  University of Pennsylvania  Case Western Reserve University  Institutions overseas such as London School of Economics and University College London, among many others.Funded colleges and Ivy League universities - see Robert Shaplen, Toward the Well-Being of Mankind: Fifty Years of the Rockefeller Foundation, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1964.

Rockefeller Museum, Israel, 1925‚Äì30  In the 1920s, the International Education Board granted important fellowships to pathbreakers in modern mathematics, such as Stefan Banach, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, and Andr√© Weil, which was a formative part of the gradual shift of world mathematics to the US over this period.  To help promote cooperation between physics and mathematics Rockefeller funds also supported the erection of the new Mathematical Institute at the University of G√∂ttingen between 1926 and 1929  The rise of probability and mathematical statistics owes much to the creation of the Institut Henri Poincar√© in Paris, partly by the Rockefellers' finances, also around this time.  John D Jr. established International House at Berkeley.  Junior was responsible for the creation and endowment of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, which operates the restored historical town at Williamsburg, Virginia, one of the most extensive historic restorations ever undertaken. Family residences Over the generations, the family members have resided in some notable historic homes. A total of 81 Rockefeller residences are on the National Register of Historic Places. Not including all homes owned by the five brothers, some of the more prominent of these residences are: *One Beekman Place - The residence of Laurance in New York City. *10 West 54th Street - A nine-story single family home, the former residence of Junior before he shifted to 740 Park Avenue, and the largest residence in New York City at the time, it was the home for the five young brothers; it was later given by Junior to the Museum of Modern Art. *740 Park Avenue - Junior and Abby's famed 40-room triplex apartment in the luxury New York City apartment building, which was later sold for a record price. *Bassett Hall - The house at Colonial Williamsburg bought by Junior in 1927 and renovated by 1936, it was the favorite residence of both Junior and Abby and is now a house museum at the family-restored Colonial Revival town. *The Casements - A three-story house at Ormond Beach in Florida, where Senior spent his last winters, from 1919 until his death. * The Eyrie - A sprawling 100-room summer holiday home on Mount Desert Island in Maine, demolished by family members in 1962. *Forest Hill - The family's country estate and summer home in Cleveland, Ohio, for four decades; built and occupied by Senior, it burned down in 1917. *Golf House at Lakewood, New Jersey - The former three- story clubhouse for the elite Ocean County Hunt and Country Club, which Senior bought in 1902 to play golf on its golf course. *Kykuit, also known as the John D. Rockefeller Estate - The landmark six-story, 40-room home on the vast Westchester County family estate, home to four generations of the family. *The JY Ranch - The landmark ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the holiday resort home built by Junior and later owned by Laurance, which was used by all members of the family and had many prominent visitors, including presidents, until Laurance donated it to the federal government in 2001. *Rockwood Hall - The former home of William Rockefeller Jr. (demolished in the 1940s).

Prominent banker and philanthropist David Rockefeller Sr. was the family patriarch until his death in 2017. In 1960, when his brother Nelson Rockefeller was governor of New York, David Sr. successfully pressed for a repeal of a New York state law that restricted Chase Manhattan Bank from operating outside the city. David Sr. was twice offered the post of Treasury secretary by President Richard M. Nixon, but declined on both occasions. In 1979, he used his high-level contacts to bring Mohammad Reza Shah of Iran, who had been overthrown in the Iranian Revolution and was in poor health, for medical treatment in the United States. In 1998, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for his work on International Executive Service Corps. Political offices held *Nelson Rockefeller (1908‚Äì1979)  1st Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs, 1944‚Äì1945  1st Under Secretary Health, Education and Welfare, 1953‚Äì1954 Governor of New York, 1959‚Äì1973 U.S. Vice President, 1974‚Äì1977 *Winthrop Rockefeller (1912‚Äì1973) Governor of Arkansas, 1967‚Äì1971 *Jay Rockefeller (b. 1937) Member of West Virginia House of Delegates, 1966‚Äì1968 Secretary of State of West Virginia, 1969‚Äì1973 Governor of West Virginia, 1977‚Äì1985 U.S. Senator from West Virginia, 1985‚Äì2015 *Winthrop Paul Rockefeller (1948‚Äì2006) Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, 1996‚Äì2006 Legacy A trademark of the dynasty over its 140-plus years has been the remarkable unity it has maintained, despite major divisions that developed in the late 1970s, and unlike other wealthy families such as the Du Ponts and the Mellons. A primary reason has been the lifelong efforts of \\"Junior\\" to not only cleanse the name from the opprobrium stemming from the ruthless practices of Standard Oil, but his tireless efforts to forge family unity even as he allowed his five sons to operate independently. This was partly achieved by regular brothers and family meetings, but it was also because of the high value placed on family unity by first Nelson and John III, and later especially with David.Family unity maintained over the decades - see John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988. (pp.370-71, passim); David's unifying influence - see Memoirs (pp.346-7) Regarding achievements, in 1972, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropy, the Carnegie Corporation, which has had a long association with the family and its institutions, released a public statement on the influence of the family on not just philanthropy but encompassing a much wider field. Summing up a predominant view among the international philanthropic world, albeit one poorly grasped by the public, one sentence of this statement read: \\"The contributions of the Rockefeller family are staggering in their extraordinary range and in the scope of their contribution to humankind.\\"Carnegie.Org \\"Rockefellers\\" John D. Rockefeller gave away US$540 million over his lifetime (in dollar terms of that time), and became the greatest lay benefactor of medicine in history.Greatest benefactor of medicine in history - see Ron Chernow, Titan: op.cit. (p.570) His son, Junior, also gave away over $537 million over his lifetime, bringing the total philanthropy of just two generations of the family to over $1 billion from 1860 to 1960. Added to this, the New York Times declared in a report in November 2006 that David Rockefeller's total charitable benefactions amount to about $900 million over his lifetime.New York Times, November 21, 2006 The combined personal and social connections of the various family members are vast, both in the United States and throughout the world, including the most powerful politicians, royalty, public figures, and chief businessmen. Notable figures through Standard Oil alone have included Henry Flagler and Henry H. Rogers. Contemporary figures include Henry Kissinger, Richard Parsons (Chairman and CEO of Time Warner), C. Fred Bergsten, Peter G. Peterson (Senior Chairman of the Blackstone Group), and Paul Volcker. In 1991, the family was presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for four generations worth of preserving and creating some of the U.S.'s most important buildings and places. David accepted the award on the family's behalf. The ceremony coincided with an exhibition on the family's contributions to the built environment, including John Sr.'s preservation efforts for the Hudson River Palisades, the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia, construction of Rockefeller Center, and Governor Nelson's efforts to construct low- and middle-income housing in New York state. The Rockefeller name is imprinted in numerous places throughout the United States, most notably in New York City, but also in Cleveland, where the family originates: * Rockefeller Center - A landmark 19-building complex in the center of Manhattan established by Junior: Older section constructed from 1930‚Äì1939; Newer section constructed during the 1960s-1970s; * Rockefeller University - Renamed in 1965, this is the distinguished Nobel prize-winning graduate/postgraduate medical school (formerly the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, established by Senior in 1901); * Rockefeller Foundation - Founded in 1913, this is the famous philanthropic organization set up by Senior and Junior; * Rockefeller Brothers Fund - Founded in 1940 by the third-generation's five sons and one daughter of Junior; * Rockefeller Family Fund - Founded in 1967 by members of the family's fourth-generation; * Rockefeller Group - A private family-run real estate development company based in New York that originally owned, constructed and managed Rockefeller Center, it is now wholly owned by Mitsubishi Estate Co.

Earlier, in the 1920s, he had also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Rheims Cathedral, the Fontainebleau Palace and the Palace of Versailles, for which he was later (1936) awarded France's highest decoration, the Grand Croix of the Legion d'Honneur (subsequently also awarded decades later to his son, David Rockefeller). He also funded the notable excavations at Luxor in Egypt, as well as establishing a Classical Studies School in Athens. In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem - the Rockefeller Museum.Restorations and constructions in France, Egypt, Greece and Jerusalem - see Memoirs, (pp.44-48). Conservation Beginning with John D. Rockefeller Sr., the family has been a major force in land conservation. Over the generations, it has created more than 20 national parks and open spaces, including the Cloisters, Acadia National Park, Forest Hill Park, the Nature Conservancy, the Rockefeller Forest in California's Humboldt Redwoods State Park (the largest stand of old-growth redwoods), and Grand Teton National Park, among many others. John Jr., and his son Laurance (and his son Laurance Jr. aka Larry) were particularly prominent in this area. The family was honored for its conservation efforts in November 2005, by the National Audubon Society, one of America's largest and oldest conservation organizations, at which over 30 family members attended. At the event, the society's president, John Flicker, notably stated: \\"Cumulatively, no other family in America has made the contribution to conservation that the Rockefeller family has made\\". In 2016 fifth-generation descendants of John Sr. criticized ExxonMobil, one of the successors to his company Standard Oil, for their record on climate change. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund both backed reports suggesting that ExxonMobil knew more about the threat of global warming than it had disclosed. David Kaiser, grandson of David Rockefeller Sr. and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said that the \\"...company seems to be morally bankrupt.\\" Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, daughter of former Senator Jay Rockefeller, said, \\"Because the source of the family wealth is fossil fuels, we feel an enormous moral responsibility for our children, for everyone  to move forward.\\" The Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced it was divesting from fossil fuels in September 2014 while the Rockefeller Family Fund announced plans to divest in March 2016. The family archives The Rockefeller family archives are held at the Rockefeller Archive Center in Pocantico Hills, North Tarrytown, NY. At present, the archives of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., William Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Abby Rockefeller Mauz√©, John D. Rockefeller III, Blanchette Rockefeller, and Nelson Rockefeller are processed and open by appointment to readers in the Archive Center's reading room. Processed portions of the papers of Laurance Rockefeller are also open. In addition, the Archive Center has a microfilm copy of the Winthrop Rockefeller papers, the originals of which are held at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. The papers of the family office, known as the Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller, are also open for research, although those portions that relate to living family members are closed.

Born in Rotterdam, Netherlands, he lived most of his life in England and used English for most of his published works. He became famous for The Fable of the Bees. Life Mandeville was born on 15 November 1670, at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where his father was a prominent physician of Huguenot origin.Project Bernard Mandeville On leaving the Erasmus school at Rotterdam he showed his ability by an Oratio scholastica de medicina (1685), and at Leiden University in 1689 he produced the thesis De brutorum operationibus, in which he advocated the Cartesian theory of automatism among animals. In 1691 he took his medical degree, pronouncing an inaugural disputation, De chylosi vitiata. He moved to England to learn the language, Britannica Student Encyclopedia and succeeded so remarkably that many refused to believe he was a foreigner. His father had been banished from Rotterdam in 1693 for involvement in the Costerman tax riots on 5 October 1690; Bernard himself may well have been involved.The Literary Encyclopedia As a physician Mandeville was well respected and his literary works were successful as well. His conversational abilities won him the friendship of Lord Macclesfield (chief justice 1710‚Äì1718), who introduced him to Joseph Addison, described by Mandeville as \\"a parson in a tye-wig.\\" He died of influenza on 21 January 1733 at Hackney, aged 62. There is a surviving image of Mandeville but many details of his life still have to be researched. Although the name Mandeville attests a French Huguenot origin, his ancestors had lived in the Netherlands since at least the 16th century. Works Fable of the Bees Fable of the bees, 1924 In 1705 he published a poem under the title The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves Turn'd Honest (two hundred doggerel couplets). In The Grumbling Hive Mandeville describes a bee community thriving until the bees are suddenly made honest and virtuous. Without their desire for personal gain their economy collapses and the remaining bees go to live simple lives in a hollow tree, thus implying that without private vices there exists no public benefit. In 1714 the poem was republished as an integral part of the Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits, consisting of a prose commentary, called Remarks, and an essay, An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue. The book was primarily written as a political satire on the state of England in 1705, when the Tories were accusing John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and the ministry of advocating the War of the Spanish Succession for personal reasons. In 1723 a later edition appeared, including An Essay on Charity and Charity Schools, and A Search into the Nature of Society. The former essay criticised the charity schools, designed to educate the poor and, in doing so, instil virtue in them. Mandeville disagreed with the idea that education adds virtue because he did not believe that evil desires existed only in the poor, but rather he saw the educated and wealthy as much more crafty.Cook, John Mandeville also believed that educating the poor increased their desires for material things, defeating the purpose of the school and making it more difficult to provide for them.The Fable of the Bees, 5 edn, London, 1728, remarks, pp. 212‚Äì13, 328, quoted in Marx 1990 [1867], Capital Vol. 1, Chapter 25, The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation, p. 765, Penguin Classics. It was vigorously combatted by, among others, Bishop Berkeley and William Law, author of The Serious Call, and in 1729 was made the subject of a prosecution for its immoral tendency. Ideas Mandeville's philosophy gave great offence at the time, and has always been stigmatised as false, cynical and degrading. His main thesis is that the actions of men cannot be divided into lower and higher. The higher life of man is a mere fiction introduced by philosophers and rulers to simplify government and the relations of society. In fact, virtue (which he defined as \\"every performance by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature, should endeavour the benefit of others, or the conquest of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being good\\") is actually detrimental to the state in its commercial and intellectual progress. This is because it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital (economics) in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. Private vice, public benefit Mandeville concluded that vice, at variance with the \\"Christian virtues\\" of his time, was a necessary condition for economic prosperity. His viewpoint is more severe when juxtaposed to Adam Smith's. Both Smith and Mandeville believed that individuals' collective actions bring about a public benefit. See also However, what sets his philosophy apart from Smith's is his catalyst to that public benefit. Smith believed in a virtuous self-interest which results in invisible co-operation. For the most part, Smith saw no need for a guide to garner that public benefit. On the other hand, Mandeville believed it was vicious greed which led to invisible co-operation if properly channelled. Mandeville's qualification of proper channelling further parts his philosophy from Smith's laissez-faire attitude. Essentially, Mandeville called for politicians to ensure that the passions of man would result in a public benefit. It was his stated belief in the Fable of the Bees that \\"Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits\\". In the Fable he shows a society possessed of all the virtues \\"blest with content and honesty,\\" falling into apathy and utterly paralysed. The absence of self-love (cf. Hobbes) is the death of progress. The so-called higher virtues are mere hypocrisy, and arise from the selfish desire to be superior to the brutes. \\"The moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride.\\" Similarly he arrives at the great paradox that \\"private vices are public benefits\\". Among other things, Mandeville argues that the basest and vilest behaviours produce positive economic effects. A libertine, for example, is a vicious character, and yet his spending will employ tailors, servants, perfumers, cooks, prostitutes. These persons, in turn, will employ bakers, carpenters, and the like. Therefore, the rapaciousness and violence of the base passions of the libertine benefit society in general. Similar satirical arguments were made by the Restoration and Augustan satirists. A famous example is Mandeville's \\"Modest Defence of Publick Stews,\\" which argued for the introduction of public, state-controlled brothels. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and mentions e.g. the clitoris as center of the female sexual pleasure.Eine Streitschrift‚Ä¶, Essay von Ursula Pia Jauch. Carl Hanser Verlag, M√ºnchen 2001. Jonathan Swift's 1729 satire A Modest Proposal is probably an allusion to Mandeville's title. Mandeville was an early describer of the division of labour, and Adam Smith makes use of some of his examples. Influence While the author probably had no intention of subverting morality, his views of human nature were seen by his critics as cynical and degraded. Another of his works, A Search into the Nature of Society (1723), appended to the later versions of the Fable, also startled the public mind, which his last works, Free Thoughts on Religion (1720) and An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour and the Usefulness of Christianity (1732) did little to reassure. The work in which he approximates most nearly to modern views is his account of the origin of society. His a priori theories should be compared with the jurist Henry Maine's historical inquiries (Ancient Law). He endeavours to show that all social laws are the crystallised results of selfish aggrandizement and protective alliances among the weak. Denying any form of moral sense or conscience, he regards all the social virtues as evolved from the instinct for self-preservation, the give-and-take arrangements between the partners in a defensive and offensive alliance, and the feelings of pride and vanity artificially fed by politicians, as an antidote to dissension and chaos. Mandeville's ironic paradoxes are interesting mainly as a criticism of the \\"amiable\\" idealism of Shaftesbury, and in comparison with the serious egoistic systems of Hobbes and Helv√©tius. Mandeville's ideas about society and politics were praised by Friedrich Hayek, a proponent of Austrian economics, in his book Law, Legislation and Liberty.See also Bibliography * Aesop Dress'd, or a Collection of Fables writ in Familiar Verse (1704) * Typhon: a Burlesque Poem (1704) * The Planter's Charity (1704) * The Virgin Unmasked (1709, 1724, 1731, 1742), a work in which the coarser side of his nature is prominent * A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Passions (1711, 1715, 1730 (the issue of 1730 was entitled A Treatise of the Hypochondriack and Hysterick Diseases)) admired by Johnson (Mandeville here protests against speculative therapeutics, and advances fanciful theories of his own about animal spirits in connection with \\"stomachic ferment\\": he shows a knowledge of Locke's methods, and an admiration for Sydenham) * The Fable of the Bees (1714, 1724) * The Mischiefs that Ought Justly to be Apprehended from a Whig-Government (1714) * Free Thoughts on Religion, the Church, and National Happiness (1720, 1721, 1723, 1729) * A Modest Defence of Publick Stews (1724, 1740) Multiple formats at Ex- Classics * An Enquiry into the Causes of the Frequent Executions at Tyburn (1725) * An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour, and the Usefulness of Christianity in War (1732) * A Letter to Dion, occasioned by his book called Alciphron or the Minute Philosopher (1732) Other works attributed, wrongly, to him are The World Unmasked (1736) and Zoologia medicinalis hibernica (1744).

He was born at Carpow, in Perthshire. He was almost entirely self- educated, having acquired a knowledge of ancient languages while employed as a shepherd. By his own intense application to study, before he was twenty years of age, he had obtained an intimate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, with the last of which he was critically conversant. He was also acquainted with the French, Italian, German, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, and Ethiopic. His early career was varied, and he was in succession a travelling merchant, a soldier in the Edinburgh garrison in 1745, and a school-master. He was, from 1750 till his death, minister of the Burgher branch of the Secession Church in Haddington. From 1786 he was professor of divinity for his denomination, and was mainly responsible for the training of its ministry. He gained a just reputation for learning and piety. The best of his many works are his Self-Interpreting Bible and Dictionary of the Bible, works that were long very popular. The former was translated into Welsh. He also wrote an Explication of the Westminster Confession, and a number of biographical and historical sketches. Early life John Brown was born at Carpow in the parish of Abernethy, in Perthshire, Scotland, the son of a self-educated weaver and river-fisherman, also called John Brown. His mother was Catherine Millie. His parents had morning and evening worship at home. His father was a poor weaver, who could only afford to send him to school for a few 'quarters.' During one month of this time he studied Latin. Even at this early period he learnt eagerly, getting up by heart 'Vincent's and Havel's Catechisms, and the Assembly's Larger Catechism.' When he was eleven his father died. His mother did not long survive. He himself was brought so low by 'four fevers on end' that his recovery was despaired of. Having recovered from this illness, he had the good fortune to find a friend and protector in John Ogilvie, a shepherd venerable for age, and eminent for piety, who fed his flock among the neighbouring mountains. This worthy individual was an elder of the parish of Abernethy, yet, though a person of intelligence and religion, was so destitute of education as to be unable even to read. To supply his own deficiency, Ogilvie was glad to engage young Brown to assist him in tending his flock, and read to him during the intervals of comparative inaction and repose which his occupation afforded. To screen themselves from the storm and the heat, they built a little lodge among the hills, and to this their mountain tabernacle (long after pointed out under this name by the peasants). Ere long it happened that Ogilvie retired from his occupation as a shepherd, and settled in the town of Abernethy. In consequence of this change, young Brown entered the service of a neighbouring farmer, who maintained a more numerous establishment than his former friend. He began to work as a herd-boy, and his contact with a wider and stranger world 'seemed to cause,' he tells us, 'not a little practical apostasy from all my former attainments. Even secret prayer was not always regularly performed, but I foolishly pleased myself by making up the number one day which had been deficient another.' A new attack of fever in 1741 reawakened his conscience, and on his recovery he 'was providentially determined, during the noontide while the sheep which I herded rested themselves in the fold, to go and hear a sermon, at the distance of two miles, running both to and from it.' Secession in the Church of Scotland Timeline showing the evolution of the churches of Scotland from 1560 In the year 1733, four ministers of the Church of Scotland, among whom was Mr Moncrieff of Abernethy, declared a secession from its judicatures, alleging as their reasons for taking this step the following list of grievances; \\"The sufferance of error without adequate censure; the infringement of the rights of the Christian people in the choice and settlement of ministers under the law of patronage; the neglect or relaxation of discipline; the restraint of ministerial freedom in opposing mal-administration, and the refusal of the prevailing party to be reclaimed.\\" To this body our young shepherd early attached himself; and ventured to conceive the idea of one day becoming a shepherd of souls in that connection. He accordingly prosecuted his studies with increasing ardour and diligence, and began to attain considerable knowledge of Latin and Greek. These acquisitions he made entirely without aid from others, except that he was able occasionally to snatch an hour when the flocks were folded at noon, in order to seek the solution of such difficulties as his unaided efforts could not master, from two neighbouring clergymen the one Mr Moncrieff of Abernethy, who has just been mentioned as one of the founders of the Secession, and the other Mr Johnston of Arngask, father of the late venerable Dr Johnston of North-Leith; both of whom were very obliging and communicative, and took great interest in promoting the progress of the studious shepherd-boy. During his life as a herd-boy he studied eagerly. He acquired a good knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His difficulties in regard to the second of those were very great, for he could not for some time get a grammar. Notwithstanding this, he managed by the exercise of patient ingenuity to learn the letters on a method he afterwards described in detail (paper of 6 Aug. 1745 quoted in Biography), He scraped together the price of a Greek testament, and a well-known story describes how he procured it. A companion agreed to take charge of his sheep for a little, so setting out at midnight, he reached St. Andrews, twenty-four miles distant, in the morning. The bookseller questioned the shepherd-boy, and Francis Pringle, a professor of Greek happened to hear the conversation. 'Boy,' said he, pointing to a passage, 'read this, and you shall have the book for nothing.' Brown read the passage,, got the volume, and walked home again with it (Memoir, p. 29; Dr. John Brown's Letter to John Cairns, D.D., p. 73). Before he was twenty years of age, he had obtained an intimate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, with the last of which he was critically conversant. He was also acquainted with the French, Italian, German, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, and Ethiopic. The herd-boy and his learning now became the subject of talk in the place. Some 'seceding students' accounted for the wonder by explaining that Brown had got his knowledge from Satan. The hypothesis was widely accepted, nor was it till some years had passed away that he was able by his blameless and diligent life to 'live it down.' He afterwards took occasion to note that just when he was 'licensed' his 'primary calumniator' was excommunicated for immoral conduct. Early career Memorial window to Rev John Brown, St Marys, Haddington by Edward Burne-Jones Brass plaque to Rev John Brown and family, St Marys, Haddington The next few years saw Brown work as a pedlar and a schoolmaster, with an interlude as a volunteer soldier in defence against the Jacobites in the Forty-Five rebellion. He volunteered with his best friend Tim Knab and for some time was one of the garrison of Edinburgh Castle. When the war was over, he again took up his pack for a time, but soon found more congenial occupation as a schoolmaster. He been teaching in 1747, and taught at Gairney Bridge, near Kinross, and at the Spittal, West Linton. His teaching days were not a relaxing time. He would commit to memory fifteen chapters of the Bible as an evening exercise after the labours of the day, and after such killing efforts, allow himself but four hours of repose. Breach in the Secession Church In 1747, a 'breach' occurred in the secession church, to which he belonged. Two bodies were formed, called the Burghers and the Anti- burghers, of whom the first maintained that it was, and the second that it was not, lawful to take the burgess oath in the Scottish towns. Following the division, there was a need for preachers in the Burgher branch, and Brown was the first new divinity student. Brown adhered to the more liberal view, and now began to prepare himself for the ministry, he studied theology and philosophy in connection with the Associate Burgher Synod under Ebenezer Erskine of Stirling, and James Fisher of Glasgow. In 1750 he was licensed to preach the gospel, and next year was unanimously called to the associate congregation of Haddington. Haddington ministry He was ordained as a minister at Haddington, East Lothian, on 4 July 1751, and that was his home for the rest of his life. He was called to occupy the position of Moderator of the Synod for the year from November 1753. His congregation was small and poor, but though afterwards invited to be pastor to the Dutch church, New York, he never left it. His ministerial duties were very hard, for during most of the year he delivered three sermons and a lecture every Sunday, whilst visiting and catechising occupied many a weekday. Still he found time to do much other work. His first publication was in 1758, and he published regularly from that date until the end of his life. Publishing Work In 1758 he published 'An Help for the Ignorant. Being an Essay towards an Easy Explication of the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechism, composed for the young ones of his own congregation.' This 'easy explication' was a volume of about 400 pages. In it he had taken occasion to affirm that Christ's righteousness, though in itself infinitely valuable, is only imparted to believers according to their need, and not so as to render them infinitely righteous. In the following year 'A brief Dissertation concerning the Righteousness of Christ' expounded the same view. He had branded the doctrine he opposed as 'antinomian and familistic blasphemy,' but notwithstanding it was defended by various anti-burgher divines, who retorted on him the charges of 'heresy,' 'blasphemy,' and 'familism,' accused him of 'gross and palpable misrepresentation,' lamented the 'poisonous fruit,' and dwelt on the 'glaring absurdity' of his doctrine (see Doctrine of the Unity and Uniformity of Christ's Surety righteousness viewed and vindicated, &c.; By Rev. John Dalziel (Edin. 1760), pp. 72‚Äì4). This bitter controversy did not prevent Brown from doing acts of practical kindness to various anti-burgher brethren. He continued to write diligently, and his name became more widely known. In 1768 he was appointed professor in divinity to the Associate burgher Synod. A great deal of work, but no salary, was attached to this office; the students studied under Brown at Haddington during a session of nine weeks each year (McKerrow's History, p. 787). In 1778 his best-known work, the 'Self-interpreting Bible,' was published at Edinburgh in two volumes. Its design, he explains in the preface, is to present the labours of the best commentators ' in a manner that might best comport with the ability and leisure of the poorer and labouring part of mankind, and especially to render the oracles of God their own interpreter.' Thus the work contains history, chronology, geography, summaries, explanatory notes, and reflections‚Äîin short, everything that the ordinary reader might be supposed to want. It is a library in one volume. Brown is always ready to give what he believes to be the only possible explanation of each verse, and to draw its only possible practical lesson therefrom. The style throughout is clear and vigorous. The book at once acquired a popularity which among a large class it has never lost. It has been read widely among the English-speaking nations, as well as in Wales and the Scottish highlands. How well known it and Brown's other works were in Scotland some characteristic lines of Burns bear witness:‚Äî For now I'm grown sae cursed douce, I pray an' ponder butt the house; My shins, my lane, I there sit roastin' Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an' Boston. ‚Å†(Letter to James Tail of Glenconner, lines 19‚Äì22.) His numerous other works strengthened his reputation, but none brought him any profit. One of his publishers, 'of his own good will,' presented him with about 40l., but this he lent and lost to another. His salary from his church was for a long time only 40l. per annum, and it was never more than 50l. Only a very small sum came to him from other sources. The stern self-denial that was a frequent feature in the early Scottish household enabled him to bring up a large family, and meet all the calls of necessity and duty on this income. 'Notwithstanding my eager desire for books, I chose rather to want them, and much more other things, than run into debt,' he says. At least one-tenth of his small means was set apart for works of charity. Character Throughout his life Brown was an eager student, and his attainments were considerable. He knew most of the European and several oriental languages. He was well read in history and divinity; his acquaintance with the Bible was of the most minute description. Although he says that 'few plays or romances are safely read, as they tickle the imagination, and are apt to infect with their defilement,' so that 'even the most pure, as Young, Thomson, Addison, Richardson, bewitch the soul, and are apt to indispose for holy meditation and other religious exercises,' and although he eagerly opposed the relaxation of the penal statutes against Roman catholics, he was, in regard to many things, not at all a narrow-minded man. His creed was to him a matter of such intense conviction, that nothing seemed allowable that tended in any way to oppose it or distract attention from its solemn doctrines. His preaching was earnest, simple, and direct, as if I had never read a book but the Bible.' His delivery was 'sing-song,' yet 'this in him was singularly melting to serious minds.' A widely current story affirms that David Hume heard him preach, and the 'sceptic' was so impressed that he said, 'That old man speaks as if the Son of God stood at his elbow.' The anecdote, though undoubtedly mythical, shows the popular impression as to his preaching. Other duties In the year 1768, in consequence of the death of the Rev. John Swanston of Kinross, Professor of Divinity under the Associate Synod, Mr Brown was elected to the vacant chair. The duties of this important office he discharged with great ability and exemplary diligence and success. His public prelections were directed to the two main objects, first, of instructing his pupils in the science of Christianity, and secondly, of impressing their hearts with its power. The system of Divinity which he was led, in the course of his professional duty, to compile, and which was afterwards published, is perhaps the one of all his works which exhibits most striking proofs of precision, discrimination, and enlargement of thought; and is altogether one of the most dense, and at the same time perspicuous views which has yet been given of the theology of the Westminster Confession. During this time Brown also continued his duties as a minister. From 1768 until the year of his death he also had the permanent post of clerk of the synod. Famous contacts His contacts with three famous contemporaries have been documented: *In 1771 Brown began a long correspondence with Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. which encouraged them mutually in their Christian endeavour. *In 1772 Brown was walking in Haddington Cemetery when he met Robert Fergusson, the poet, in a dark mood. *The philosopher David Hume heard Brown preaching in North Berwick and commented that Brown preached \\"as if he were conscious that Christ was at his elbow\\". Death Brown's labours finally ruined his health, which during the last years of his life was very poor. He continued his work to very near the end. Brown died at his home in Haddington on 19 June 1787, after months of stomach problems. His last words were \\"My Christ\\". He was interred in the church-yard there, where there is a monument to his memory. A memorial stained glass window and brass plaque to his memory lie in St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington. Works John Brown wrote numerous books, of which the most notable are described here. Only one dictionary of the Bible (by Thomas Wilson (1563‚Äì1622)), by then long out of print, had preceded Brown's The Dictionary of the Bible. It therefore met a need and after the initial edition published in 1769 numerous editions, variously amended, were issued until 1868. It expressed a Calvinist theology, and in it, the author estimated that 2016 would see the Millennium. Many articles in it are long and appear to be tracts or sermons. A General History of the Christian Church was issued in two volumes in 1771. The Self Interpreting Bible was Brown's most significant work, and it remained in print (edited by others), until well into the twentieth century. The objective of providing a commentary for ordinary people was very successful. The idea that the Bible was \\"self-interpreting\\" involved copious marginal references, especially comparing one scriptural statement with another. Brown also provided a substantial introduction to the Bible, and added an explication and \\"reflections\\" for each chapter. A measure of its popularity is that it was translated into Welsh, and its appearance in Robert Burns's \\"Epistle to James Tennant\\". Some of his original manuscripts are held by East Lothian Council Archives.

John Brown, as depicted by the Edinburgh artist John Kay. John Brown (173517 October 1788) was a Scottish physician and the creator of the Brunonian system of medicine. Life Brown was born in Berwickshire, the son of a day- laborer. He was able to obtain an early and 'excellent classical education' from Mr. William Cruickshank, \\"one of the most celebrated teachers Scotland has produced.\\" Brown had a particular ability for Latin, and was an early reader, having read the whole of the Old Testament by age 5. As one of his contemporaries, Thomas Beddoes, a renowned English physician, wrote in 1795: \\"I conclude that he was endowed with that quickness of sympathy and that sensibility to the charms of nature, which characterize the infancy of genius.\\" He was forced, however, to leave the parish school at Duns, Scottish Borders due to his family's poverty, and was apprenticed to a local weave. His son later wrote, for someone so \\"highly cultivated\\": \\"it may be readily conceived how truly disgusting the sordid life of one of the lowest mechanical businesses must have proved.\\" Brown left, at the age of twenty, and headed to Edinburgh, enrolled in divinity classes at the University of Edinburgh, and worked part-time as a private tutor. In 1759 he discontinued his theological studies, began the study of medicine, and became the private tutor for the family of the leading Edinburgh physician William Cullen. He also became the Latin secretary for Cullen, and also was treated effectively as an assistant professor. In 1761 Brown became a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in Edinburg, which Cullen has helped to found. Brown played a role in the passionate debates in the Society regarding the reform of medical theory and practice, which had been inaugurated by Albrecht von Haller regarding neuropsychology and promoted by Cullen in Edinburgh. Due to his own experiences and understanding, Brown began to formulate his own conception of the nature of life and illness that differed from his mentor, Cullen. This led to various personal disputes as well with Cullen and the professors of the university, though supported by many students. As one account stated: \\"Cullen estranged the mind of his Latin Secretary\\" and \\"ceased to hold any communication\\" with Brown or \\"even to mention his name.\\" In the face of this opposition to his views, Brown set out to give public lectures, contained attacks on preceding systems of medicine, including Cullen's. He received his medical degree from St Andrews in 1780 as he had been barred from graduating at Edinburgh University due to his 'heretical' views. That same year he published his formal explication and defense of his proposed reform of medicine, Elementa Medicinae. That year he was also elected, by his pupils and admirers, senior president of the Royal Society of Medicine. Despite this popularity, Brown was shunned by the medical profession and the upper classes in Edinburgh, causing him financial difficulties, and forcing him to arrange for his students to graduate through the University of Aberdeen, as the medical faculty at Edinburgh had banned the mention of Brown's teachings in any inaugural dissertations. In 1786, Brown decided to try to further his career and resolve his financial difficulties by moving to London. However, he ended up in debtor's prison, where he died one evening in 1788 at the age of fifty-two, just after he had managed to publish the third edition of his main work, in English, Elements of Medicine.  Theory of Medicine  In 1780, he published his Elementa Medicinae (Elements of Medicine in its English version), which for a time was an influential text. It set out his theories, often called the Brunonian system of medicine, which essentially understood all diseases as a matter of over or under-stimulation. John Brown's theory focused on outside factors, which would excite the body and lead to different diseases and the presentation of various symptoms. The stimulation was seen as excitability; hence the relation of Brunonian medicine and excitants. John Brown argued that any symptoms of disease or behavior which strayed from that of a healthy individual suggested over-excitement of the body. For instance, even a person presenting as weak had been over-excited. Brown labeled over- stimulation as the sthenic state and under-stimulation as the asthenic state. For sthenic diseases, Brown's treatments included vomiting, cold air, and purging. For asthenic diseases, Brown prescribed opium, roast beef, and alcoholic beverages. He wrote that \\"all life consists in stimulus, and both over-abundance and deficiency is productive of diseases.\\" Brown described medicine as related to excitement and his medicine was seen as mechanical to certain individuals and dynamic to others. For instance, Immanuel Kant perceived the system as highly mechanical and related it to mathematics. This system explained disease as the imbalance of excitants and could be quantified. Kant believed that this quantification could be used to explain the cause of disease and lead to medicine to cure or fix this imbalance. On the other hand, an avid follower in Germany, Andreas R√∂schlaub, perceived Brunonian medicine as an example of natural philosophy and as a changing theory. He saw this practice of medicine as a way to explain relationships between nature and man. This notion was rooted in pathology and relation of the outside world to man and his disease or illness. In his work, Brown outlined and explained which excitants were good and bad for the body. The Brunonian system of treatment was intended to outline specific treatments for symptoms and to simplify medicine. This system was also simple enough that many physicians could practice according to Brunonianism, as it did not require extensive anatomical knowledge or association of specific outward symptoms with certain diseases. Due to this simplicity, among other reasons, it became very popular in countries such as Germany.  Impact in Europe  His medical ideas proved highly influential for the next few decades, especially in Italy and Germany. As his medical theory was based on the principle that all disease was caused by an unbalance of \\"excitability\\", which referred to the body's ability to react to stimuli, he believed that excitement could be measured mathematically similar to the use of degrees on a thermometer. At this time in Germany, many physicians were attempting to change and revamp the medical curriculum and theories. German physicians wanted a system rooted in science which would give a scientific explanation to diseases, as the medical world began to emphasize science. John Brown's theory explained the relationship between the outside world, causing excitement, and the body, which was stimulated by the world. Brown's Elementa Medicinae did notably well in Germany, first translated and published in German by Adam M. Weikard in 1795. Weikard received a copy of the book from student Andreas R√∂schlaub, who had received a copy from a visiting friend. Other translations of Brown's work began to appear around Germany, included an edition from Christof Pfaff in 1796, followed by another edition of this translated book in 1798. R√∂schlaub, the student who had introduced Brown's work to the academic scene, later published his own translation and titled it as John Brown's s√§mtliche Werke. R√∂schlaub, an avid follower of John Brown, also worked with Adalbert Marcus to create a new medical system, which they implemented in a hospital in Bamberg. The new system was called Erregbarkeitstheorie concerning excitability and this system borrowed from Brown's system and the idea that excitement could be quantified. The hospital in Bamberg, which became a hub for medicine, included the principles from Brown's theory and helped create a prestigious institute. In time, however, there were arguments concerning the validity and accuracy of this system in Germany. Jacob Friedrich Ludwig Lentin's Medizinische Bemerkungen auf ein literarischen Reise durch Deutschland (1800) talked about German medicine being dominated by the struggles of Brunonians and \\"anti-Brunonian terrorists.\\" There are also reports of 400 students rioting in a dispute between the two sides in the German university city of G√∂ttingen in 1802. One critic of John Brown's theory was August von Kotzebue, who wrote plays to reflect his disdain for this theory of medicine. In his plays he would portray Brunonianism and doctors who practiced this method in a negative light. Magazines and newspapers in Germany also reflected varying ideas on John Brown's system, some positive and some negative and critical. R√∂schalub's Magazin would support Brunonian medicine and promoted the system amidst criticisms from other publications at the time. Discussion on John Brown began to cease after 1809 with the end of R√∂schalub's Magazin. During a typhoid outbreak in 1813‚Äì1814 Brown's Brunonian medicine was briefly referenced as Germans attempted to remedy the illness. By 1817, however, the German historian of medicine Kurt Sprengel suggested that Brunonian medicine \\"has very few supporters.\\" Once again, Brunonian medicine came back in the 1820s, and was in the spotlight again as Fran√ßois-Joseph- Victor Broussais rose to fame. Broussais, a French physician, was becoming very popular in the beginning of the 1820s and his medicinal theory was based on John Brown's own Brunonian medicine. Brown had also become a famous historical figure in Germany by 1846, when Bernhard Hirschel published a study on his system and the effects of Brunonian medicine. However, Brunonianism began to decline as physicians did not believe is adequately provided a scientific explanation to diseases and illnesses. Freemasonry Brown was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, on 28 November 1835. He is described as being the 'Founder of the Brownonian system of medicine.'History of the Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, compiled from the records 1677-1888. By Alan MacKenzie. 1888. P.238.  Death  In 1786, Brown went to London to improve his fortunes but died of apoplexy two years later, on 17 October 1788. In 1789 a Cambridge undergraduate called William Margetson Heald published The Brunoniad, a mock epic poem about Brown, mocking his consumption of alcohol and opium and referring to a bar brawl in Dunn's Hotel in Edinburgh's New Town. Legacy In 1795, a critical edition of Brown's Elements of Medicine was published by the well-known physician Thomas Beddoes for the benefit of Brown's widow and children.Staff (January 1811) \\"Stock's Life of Beddoes\\" The Medical and Physical Journal 25: pp. 172‚Äì175; 259‚Äì264; 342‚Äì348, p. 263 An edition of Brown's works, with a biography by his son William Cullen Brown, appeared in 1804. Brown was the grandfather of the artist Ford Madox Brown and the great-great grandfather of the novelist Ford Madox Ford. Notes References  Further reading * McGrew, Roderick.

It was created in 1972 and was initially only sold for one year in the United States by toy company Kenner (later purchased by Hasbro). In 2001 the Japanese toy company Takara began producing new editions of Blythe dolls. There is a network of hobbyists who customize the doll for resale and create clothing and shoes for Blythe. Enthusiasts share photographs of their work and other types of dolls on the Internet.  History  Blythe was created in the early seventies by designer Allison Katzman at Marvin Glass and Associates and bought and produced in the United States in 1972 by the now-defunct toy company Kenner. Blythe dolls were only sold for one year in the U.S. (produced in Hong Kong) and also in the UK, Australia and Japan, during 1972. Over time the original \\"Kenner\\" Blythe dolls acquired a cult following of collectors and eventually, photographers. In mid-1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka, which acquired Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. in 1987. Since then, all the intellectual properties are owned by Hasbro. In 1997, New York TV and video producer Gina Garan was given a 1972 Kenner Blythe by a friend and began using it to practice her photographic skills. She began taking her Blythe everywhere with her and took hundreds of photos. In 1999, she was introduced to CWC's Junko Wong by artist and illustrator, Jeffrey Fulvimari who brought Blythe to the attention of Parco and toy executives. In 2000, Gina published her first book of Blythe photography with Chronicle Books, This is Blythe. In 2001, Hasbro (the current trademark and license owner) gave Takara of Japan and CWC a license to produce the New Edition of Blythe (Neo Blythe). Blythe was used in a television advertising campaign by Parco, the fashion branch of Seibu Department Stores in Japan and was an instant hit. In 2003 Blythe was the subject in a segment on the VH1 special, I Love the '70s, where she was said to look like either \\"Barbie with elephantiasis\\" or \\"Christina Ricci\\" among other things. The success in Japan led Hasbro to issue a license to Ashton-Drake Galleries in 2004 to sell Blythe replica dolls in the United States, where the doll became a niche product in a marginal market, selling largely to adults. In spring 2009, Alexander McQueen launched a fashion line for Target with an ad campaign featuring Blythe dolls. In 2010, Hasbro began releasing their version of Blythe as a part of the Littlest Pet Shop toy line.  Doll releases  There are three sizes of Blythe dolls: the original 28 cm (1/6 scale) full-sized dolls, the 11.2 cm \\"Petite Blythe\\" from Takara and the \\"Middie Blythe\\" of about 20 cm. Only full-sized dolls have color-changing eyes. The first Petite dolls were keychains, and after some time the design was changed so the Petite eyes would close when the doll was laid down. The Middie Blythes eyes can turn to the sides and her head can twist around. Older dolls are sought after in the collectors market, and can sell for as high as several thousand dollars for an original Kenner doll to a thousand dollars or more for the first edition Neo dolls from Takara. Original Kenner dolls In 1972 Kenner released versions of the doll with four hair colors in the U.S., a brunette with chunky bangs, a sidepart brunette, a darker brunette with thinner bangs, a sidepart blonde, a red head with bangs, and a sidepart redhead. Twelve different outfits were released as well, along with four brightly colored wigs. The dolls were also released in Japan in 1972 by Tomy under the brand name Mahou no Hitomi Ai Ai Chan. The outfits and the box design were completely different from the ones released in other countries and are extremely rare.  Takara/CWC  Blythe dolls from around 2006, left to right: Velvet Minuet, Love Mission, Asian Butterfly Beginning in 2001, Takara first released new Blythe dolls sporadically, but then began releasing new versions of Blythe each month. Under the creative direction of Junko Wong, CWC has produced 207 Neo Blythes, 211 Petites, and 17 of the newest addition to the Blythe line: the Middie Blythe dolls. Every one of these Blythes were exhibited at Parco Factory at the 10th Anniversary from June‚ÄìJuly 2011. Newer releases of the Petite Blythe dolls have \\"sleepy eyes\\" and bendable bodies. The Middies' heads tilt and their eyes look left and right without changing color. The bodies of the full-size dolls vary depending on the time of the release. Early releases in 2001-2002 used the body of the Licca doll. In June 2002, in commemoration of 1 year of Blythe releases by Takara/CWC, the doll Miss Anniversary was released featuring the \\"Excellent Body\\" that was quite similar to the original Blythe released by Kenner. Early dolls also had a glossy surface texture, but some had matte face too. The earliest face molds of the reproduction Blythe dolls are referred to as BL. Two more face molds followed the BL mold, the Excellent mold, or EBL, and the Superior mold, or SBL, in 2003. In 2006 a new face mold, the Radiant mold or RBL, was introduced to look more Kenner-like, including slightly wider eyes. In 2009 another new face mold, the Fairest mold or FBL, was released with matte texture and smaller eye holes. The BL and EBL mold are actually the same mold. The difference in the EBL mold were important internal changes to make the eye mechanism more resistant. In 2013, due to wearing in the Radiance mold, or RBL, a new mold called Radiance+, or RBL+, was released and it's supposed to look exactly like the Radiance mold. Some changes were made in the eye mechanism as well, it became a lot lighter and easier to change the eyes compared to older releases. By 2013, Hasbro left the Petite Blythes behind to new redesigned doll which seemed to be the end of the collaboration between the brands, despite the doll still being called Blythe, the Blythe logo was no longer used. In December 2013 Takara/CWC released the Petite Blythe Suri Tebya Lyublyu after 2 years since the Petite Blythe Birthday Party Surprise.  Other incarnations  Ashton-Drake Galleries produced nearly exact replicas of the 5 original Kenner dolls in 2005-2006, along with replicas based on the original Kenner outfits. The first release had skin-tones with a slight green tint. A second release in 2007 was less green and more peach-pink. Both releases have a matte surface texture. Ashton Drake in total released 12 different full-sized Blythe dolls, but ceased production in 2008. Blythe doll from the Blythe Loves Littlest Pet Shop line, released by Hasbro in 2010 In 2010, Hasbro released the Blythe Loves Littlest Pet Shop line as a part of their 2004 incarnation of the Littlest Pet Shop toy line, with Blythe dolls as petsitters for their animal toys in the aforementioned toy line. Blythe stars as a protagonist in the Littlest Pet Shop Presents animated shorts that were produced by Cosmic Toast Studios and released online by Hasbro (voice unknown). Another incarnation of the character, named Blythe Baxter (voiced by Ashleigh Ball), stars in the 2012 Littlest Pet Shop animated television series, as well as its related shorts (not to be confused with the Cosmic Toast shorts), that were produced by Hasbro Studios and DHX Media.

Life He was born in 1715 at Rothbury, Northumberland, the son of the Rev. John Brown (1677‚Äì1763), vicar of Wigton from that year, and his wife Eleanor Troutbeck, n√©e Potts. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1732, graduating B.A. 1736, and M.A. 1739; he became D.D. in 1755. Graduating as senior wrangler, Brown took holy orders, and was appointed minor canon and lecturer at Carlisle. In the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion he took part in the defence of Carlisle as a volunteer, and in 1747 was appointed chaplain to Richard Osbaldiston, on his appointment to the bishopric of Carlisle. In 1756 Brown was promoted by the Earl of Hardwicke to the living of Great Horkesley in Essex. In 1760 he was made vicar of St Nicholas Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. Brown was consulted, through Daniel Dumaresq, about a scheme of education which Catherine II of Russia wanted to introduce into her dominions. A memorandum on the subject by Brown led to an offer on her part to entertain him at St Petersburg as her adviser on the subject. He had bought a postchaise and various other things for the journey, when he was persuaded to relinquish the design on account of his gout. He had been subject to fits of melancholy, and, influenced perhaps by disappointment, he committed suicide on 23 September 1766. There is a detailed account of John Brown by Andrew Kippis in Biographia (1780), containing the text of the negotiations for his journey to Russia. Man of letters The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and The Machiavellian Moment agree that Brown was a writer influenced by Machiavelli, Bolingbroke, and Montesquieu. To these the ODNB adds John Locke; and Pocock Cato, i.e. Cato's Letters. He made his way as a man of letters as a younger member of the \\"Warburtonian circle\\": the followers of the cleric William Warburton. Rise of an essayist Brown published Honour (1743), a poem, through Robert Dodsley. It was followed by An Essay on Satire Occasion'd by the Death of Mr Pope (1745), which Brown at Carlisle published through Dodsley in London. This work gained for him the friendship of William Warburton. Warburton introduced him to Ralph Allen. At Warburton's suggestion, Brown expanded the Essay on Satire, to an Essay (1751) on the Characteristicks of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury. It is considered to have skewered Shaftesbury's deism and moral sense theory. The \\"test of ridicule\\" was supposed to be a key part of Shaftesbury's doctrine; Warburton wanted it undermined, and gave Brown the task. The Essay was dedicated to Allen, also a supporter of Anglican orthodoxy, and opponent of Shaftesbury. It contains a defence of a utilitarian philosophy, praised later by John Stuart Mill. The work was attacked, and Shaftesbury defended, in pamphlets by Charles Bulkley. Brown's theoretical argument, that ridicule was a type of valuation incompatible with a role as truth value, was taken up by William Preston. Drama Brown was interested in drama, but it earned him the disapproval of Warburton and Richard Hurd. He wrote Barbarossa (1754) and Athelstane (1756), both performed; David Garrick and Colley Cibber played in both, and the first was a success. Later, Brown's 1765 revision of Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair was rejected for production by Garrick. \\"Estimate\\" Brown Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times title page, 1757 Brown's major popular success was the Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times (2 vols., 1757‚Äì1758), a bitter satire. It struck a chord after the Battle of Minorca (1756), a British reverse at the outset of the Seven Years' War. Edmund Burke, in a review for The Annual Register for 1758, rejected Brown's analysis as far as it depended on charges of \\"effeminacy\\" in the British nation and aesthetic. Thomas Sheridan believed the fundamental issue was selfishness, and the solution better oratory.Conrad Brunstr√∂m, Thomas Sheridan and the Evil Ends of Writing, New Hibernia Review / Iris √âireannach Nua Vol. 3, No. 4 (Winter, 1999), pp. 130‚Äì142, at p. 138. Published by: University of St. Thomas (Center for Irish Studies) Robert Wallace replied with The Characteristics of the Present Political State of Great Britain (1758). In it he defended British culture and the current constitution. Brown's An Explanatory Defence of the Estimate (1758) claimed he had acted out to duty to country. Having earned the name \\"Estimate\\" Brown, he was prepared to notice Wallace, out of all his critics. When Charles Hanbury Williams gave Brown notice that he had written a reply to the first volume of the Estimate, a complex row dragging in Dodsley ensued, ending with Brown sending a curt message \\"Footman's language I never return.\\" A sequel on the politics of the Seven Years' War was Additional Dialogue of the Dead between Pericles and Cosmo (1760), in vindication of William Pitt the elder's policy. Aesthetics Brown knew Charles Avison, the Newcastle organist and composer, who published in 1752 An Essay on Musical Expression. The following year William Hayes defended Handel against Avison in a pamphlet, and stated that his Essay had been written for him by a \\"Junto\\". Brown had certainly contributed to it, with a number of others including William Mason. He went on to write A dissertation on the rise, union, and power, the progressions, separations and corruptions of poetry and music (1763). Avison's work prompted other such British aesthetic syntheses, from James Beattie, Thomas Twining and Daniel Webb; and the theme was picked up by German writers. Brown's work has been identified as belonging to conjectural history; he described in a 1761 letter to Garrick his stadial method of \\"deducing things from their state in savage life, through the several stages of civilized society.\\"Ilias Chrissochoidis, Reforming Handel: John Brown and \\"The Cure of Saul\\" (1763), Journal of the Royal Musical Association Vol. 136, No. 2 (2011), pp. 207‚Äì245, at p. 212.

He was a family friend of William Gilpin. He wrote on the subject to George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, around 1753. This letter has been identified as the first documentation of the \\"classicising\\" of the Lake District. It was published, in part, in 1766, in the London Chronicle; and then as a pamphlet.

Many naturally occurring protease inhibitors are proteins. In medicine, protease inhibitor is often used interchangeably with alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT, which is abbreviated PI for this reason).OMIM - PROTEASE INHIBITOR 1; PI A1AT is indeed the protease inhibitor most often involved in disease, namely in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.  Classification  Protease inhibitors may be classified either by the type of protease they inhibit, or by their mechanism of action. In 2004 Rawlings and colleagues introduced a classification of protease inhibitors based on similarities detectable at the level of amino acid sequence. This classification initially identified 48 families of inhibitors that could be grouped into 26 related superfamily (or clans) by their structure. According to the MEROPS database there are now 81 families of inhibitors. These families are named with an I followed by a number, for example, I14 contains hirudin- like inhibitors.  By protease  Classes of proteases are: * Aspartic protease inhibitors * Cysteine protease inhibitors * Metalloprotease inhibitors * Serine protease inhibitors * Threonine protease inhibitors * Trypsin inhibitors  Kunitz STI protease inhibitor  By mechanism  Classes of inhibitor mechanisms of action are: * Suicide inhibitor * Transition state inhibitor * Protein protease inhibitor (see serpins) * Chelating agents  Families   Inhibitor I4  This is a family of protease suicide inhibitors called the serpins. It contains inhibitors of multiple cysteine and serine protease families. Their mechanism of action relies on undergoing a large conformational change which inactivates their target's catalytic triad. Inhibitor I9 Proteinase propeptide inhibitors (sometimes referred to as activation peptides) are responsible for the modulation of folding and activity of the peptidase pro-enzyme or zymogen. The pro-segment docks into the enzyme, shielding the substrate binding site, thereby promoting inhibition of the enzyme. Several such propeptides share a similar topology, despite often low sequence identities. The propeptide region has an open-sandwich antiparallel-alpha/antiparallel-beta fold, with two alpha-helices and four beta-strands with a (beta/alpha/beta)x2 topology. The peptidase inhibitor I9 family contains the propeptide domain at the N-terminus of peptidases belonging to MEROPS family S8A, subtilisins. The propeptide is removed by proteolytic cleavage; removal activating the enzyme. Inhibitor I10 This family includes both microviridins and marinostatins. It seems likely that in both cases it is the C-terminus which becomes the active inhibitor after post-translational modifications of the full length, pre- peptide. It is the ester linkages within the key, 12-residue region that circularise the molecule giving it its inhibitory conformation. Inhibitor I24 This family includes PinA, which inhibits the endopeptidase La. It binds to the La homotetramer but does not interfere with the ATP binding site or the active site of La. Inhibitor I29 The inhibitor I29 domain, which belongs to MEROPS peptidase inhibitor family I29, is found at the N-terminus of a variety of peptidase precursors that belong to MEROPS peptidase subfamily C1A; these include cathepsin L, papain, and procaricain. It forms an alpha- helical domain that runs through the substrate-binding site, preventing access. Removal of this region by proteolytic cleavage results in activation of the enzyme. This domain is also found, in one or more copies, in a variety of cysteine peptidase inhibitors such as salarin. Inhibitor I34 The saccharopepsin inhibitor I34 is highly specific for the aspartic peptidase saccharopepsin. In the absence of saccharopepsin it is largely unstructured, but in its presence, the inhibitor undergoes a conformational change forming an almost perfect alpha-helix from Asn2 to Met32 in the active site cleft of the peptidase. Inhibitor I36 The peptidase inhibitor family I36 domain is only found in a small number of proteins restricted to Streptomyces species. All have four conserved cysteines that probably form two disulphide bonds. One of these proteins from Streptomyces nigrescens, is the well characterised metalloproteinase inhibitor SMPI. The structure of SMPI has been determined. It has 102 amino acid residues with two disulphide bridges and specifically inhibits metalloproteinases such as thermolysin, which belongs to MEROPS peptidase family M4. SMPI is composed of two beta-sheets, each consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands. The structure can be considered as two Greek key motifs with 2-fold internal symmetry, a Greek key beta- barrel. One unique structural feature found in SMPI is in its extension between the first and second strands of the second Greek key motif which is known to be involved in the inhibitory activity of SMPI. In the absence of sequence similarity, the SMPI structure shows clear similarity to both domains of the eye lens crystallins, both domains of the calcium sensor protein-S, as well as the single-domain yeast killer toxin. The yeast killer toxin structure was thought to be a precursor of the two-domain beta gamma-crystallin proteins, because of its structural similarity to each domain of the beta gamma-crystallins. SMPI thus provides another example of a single-domain protein structure that corresponds to the ancestral fold from which the two- domain proteins in the beta gamma-crystallin superfamily are believed to have evolved. Inhibitor I42 Inhibitor family I42 includes chagasin, a reversible inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Chagasin has a beta- barrel structure, which is a unique variant of the immunoglobulin fold with homology to human CD8alpha. Inhibitor I48 Inhibitor family I48 includes clitocypin, which binds and inhibits cysteine proteinases. It has no similarity to any other known cysteine proteinase inhibitors but bears some similarity to a lectin-like family of proteins from mushrooms. Inhibitor I53 Members of this family are the peptidase inhibitor madanin proteins. These proteins were isolated from tick saliva. Inhibitor I67 Bromelain inhibitor VI, in the Inhibitor I67 family, is a double-chain inhibitor consisting of an 11-residue and a 41-residue chain. Inhibitor I68 The Carboxypeptidase inhibitor I68 family represents a family of tick carboxypetidase inhibitors. Inhibitor I78 The peptidase inhibitor I78 family includes Aspergillus elastase inhibitor.

Rashƒ´d al-Dƒ´n ·π¨abƒ´b (), also known as Rashƒ´d al-Dƒ´n Fa·∏çlullƒÅh HamadƒÅnƒ´ (), (1247‚Äì1318) was a statesman, historian and physician in Ilkhanate-ruled Iran.\\"Rashid ad-Din\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed 11 April 2007. He was born into a Persian Jewish family from Hamadan. Having converted to Islam by the age of 30, Rashid al-Din became the powerful vizier of the Ilkhan, Ghazan. Later he was commissioned by Ghazan to write the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh, now considered the most important single source for the history of the Ilkhanate period and the Mongol Empire. He retained his position as a vizier until 1316. After being charged with poisoning the Ilkhanid king √ñljait√º, he was executed in 1318. Historian Morris Rossabi calls Rashid al-Din \\"arguably the most distinguished figure in Persia during Mongolian rule\\".Genghis Khan: World Conqueror? Introduction by Morris Rossabi http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/9780631189497/GK_sample_chap.pdf He was a prolific author and established the Rab'-e Rashidi academic foundation in Tabriz. Biography JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh of Rashid al-Din, 1305‚Äì1306. Rashid al-Din was born into a Persian Jewish family in Hamadan, now in Hamadan Province. His grandfather had been a courtier to the founder Ilkhanate ruler Hulagu Khan, and Rashid al-Din's father was an apothecary at the court. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty.George Lane, Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule,Hackett Publishing , 2009 p.121. Rashid was trained as a physician and started service under Hulagu's son, Abaqa Khan. He rose to become the Grand Vizier of the Ilkhanid court at Soltaniyeh, near Qazvin. He served as vizier and physician under the Ilkhanate emperors Ghazan and √ñljait√º before falling to court intrigues during the reign of Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, whose ministers had him killed at the age of seventy. His son, Ghiyas al-Din ibn Rashid al-Din, briefly served as vizier after him. JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh The JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh (\\"Compendium of Chronicles\\") was commissioned by Ghazan and initially was a history of the Mongols and their dynasty, but gradually expanded to include the entire history since the time of Adam to Rashid al- Din's time. Rashid was assisted by Bolad, a Mongol nobleman who was the emissary of the Great Khan to the Ilkhanid court. Bolad provided him with much background about Mongol history, especially about the Borjigin clan. The Compendium was completed between 1307 and 1316, during the reign of √ñljait√º. Calligraphy workshop: Rab' i-Rashidi The work was executed at the elaborate scriptorium Rab'-e Rashidi at Qazvin, where a large team of calligraphers and illustrators were employed to produce lavishly illustrated books. These books could also be copied, while preserving accuracy, using a printing process imported from China. Hulagu Khan with his Eastern Christian wife, Doquz Khatun. Hulagu conquered Muslim Syria, in collaboration with Christian forces from Cilician Armenia, Georgia, and Antioch. From Rashid al- Din's work. The work was at the time of completion, , of monumental size. Several sections have not survived or been discovered. Portions of the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh survive in lavishly illustrated manuscripts, believed to have been produced during his lifetime and perhaps under his direct supervision at the Rab'-e Rashidi workshop.The large literature on these includes: S. Blair, A compendium of chronicles : Rashid al-Din‚Äôs illustrated history of the world, 1995, 2006 (contains a complete set of the folios from Khalili collection, with discussion of the work as a whole); B. Gray, The 'World history' of Rashid al-Din: A study of the Royal Asiatic Society manuscript, Faber, 1978 . See the article on the work for more Historiographical significance Volumes I and II of the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh have survived and are of great importance for the study of the Ilkhanate. Volume I is \\"contains the history of the Turkish and Mongol tribes, including their tribal legends, genealogies, myths and the history of the Mongol conquests from the time of Genghis Khan to the end of the reign of Ghazan Khan\\" while volume II describes \\"the history of all the peoples with whom the Mongols had fought or with whom they had exchanged embassies\\". In his narration down to the reign of M√∂ngke Khan (1251‚Äì1259), Ata-Malik Juvayni was Rashid al-Din's main source; however, he also utilized numerous now-lost Far Eastern and other sources. The JƒÅmi ø al- TawƒÅrƒ´kh is perhaps the single most comprehensive Persian source on the Mongol period. For the period of Genghis Khan, his sources included the now lost Altan Debter (\\"Golden Book\\"). His treatment of the Ilkhanid period seems to be biased, as he himself was a high official, yet it is still seen as the most valuable written source for the dynasty. The third volume is either lost or was never completed; its topic was \\"historical geography\\". The most important historiographic legacy of the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh may be its documentation of the cultural mixing and ensuing dynamism that led to the greatness of the Persian and Ottoman Empires, many aspects of which were transmitted to Europe and influenced the Renaissance. This was the product of the geographical extension of the Mongol Empire, and is most clearly reflected in this work by Rashid al-Din. The text describes the different peoples with whom the Mongols came into contact and is one of the first attempts to transcend a single cultural perspective and to treat history on a universal scale. The JƒÅmi ø attempted to provide a history of the whole world of that era, though many parts are lost. One of the volumes of the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh deals with an extensive History of the Franks (1305/1306), possibly based on information from Europeans working under the Ilkhanates such as Isol the Pisan or the Dominican friars, which is a generally consistent description with many details on Europe's political organization, the use of mappae mundi by Italian mariners and regnal chronologies derived from the chronicle of Martin of Opava (d. 1278).Jackson, p.329‚Äì330. Book transmission: printing and translation Mongol cavalry pursuing their enemy. Ghazan on his horse. Rashid al-Din, JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh. Rashid al-Din also collected all of his compositions into a single volume, entitled Jami' al-Tasanif al-Rashidi (\\"The Collected Works of Rashid\\"), complete with maps and illustrations. He even had some of his shorter works, on medicine and government, translated into Chinese. Anyone who wished was given access to his works and encouraged to copy them. In order to facilitate this, he set aside a fund to pay for the annual transcription of two complete manuscripts of his works, one in Arabic and one in Persian. The printing process used at the workshop has been described by Rashid al-Din, and bears very strong resemblance to the processes used in the large printing ventures in China under Feng Dao (932‚Äì953):  Authorship and plagiarism accusations  The authorship of the JƒÅmi ø al- TawƒÅrƒ´kh has been questioned on several grounds. Abu al-Qasim Kashani (d. 1324), who wrote the most important extant contemporary source on √ñljait√º, maintained that he himself was the true author of the JƒÅmi ø al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh, \\"for which Rashid al-Din had stolen not only the credit but also the very considerable financial rewards.\\" According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, \\"While there is little reason to doubt Ra≈°id-al-Din‚Äôs overall authorship of the JƒÅme ø al-tawƒÅri·∏µ, the work has generally been considered a collective effort, partly carried out by research assistants.\\" Kashani may have been one of those assistants. Some also contended that it was a translation of a Mongol original. Authorship of his Letters Scholars are in dispute about whether Rashid al-Din's Letters are a forgery or not. According to David Morgan in The Mongols, Alexander Morton has shown them to be a forgery, probably from the Timurid period. One scholar who has attempted to defend the letters' authenticity is Abolala Soudovar. Fahlavi poems There are some fahlavƒ´yƒÅt by him apparently in his native dialect: a hemistich called zabƒÅn-e fahlavƒ´ (1976, I, p. 290), a quatrain with the appellation bayt-efahlavƒ´, and another hemistich titled zabƒÅn-e pahlavƒ´ (\\"Fahlavi language\\").Ahmad Tafazzoli, \\"Fahlaviyat\\" in Encyclopedia Iranica Loss of influence and death Mongol ruler, Ghazan, studying the Quran In 1312, his colleague Sa'd-al-Din Mohammad Avaji fell from power and was replaced by Taj-al-Din Ali-Shah Jilani. Then, in 1314, √ñljait√º died and power passed to his son, Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, who sided with Ali-Shah. In 1318, Rashid al-Din was charged with having poisoned √ñljait√º and was executed on July 13, at the age of seventy., p. 101. His Jewish ancestry was referenced numerous times in the court. His head was carried around the city after the execution and people were chanting: \\"This is the head of the Jew who abused God's name, may God's curse be upon him.\\" , page 3. His property was confiscated and Rab'-e Rashidi, with its scriptorium and its precious copies, were turned over to the Mongol soldiery. A century later, during the reign of Timur's son Miran Shah, Rashid al-Din's bones were exhumed from the Muslim cemetery and reburied in the Jewish cemetery.[, p. 417] National and political thoughts Rashid al-din was an Iranian patriot and also an admirer of the Iranian state traditions. The name of \\"Iran\\" is mentioned in his Jami' al-tawarikh, and he showed dislike for Mongols (whom he refers to as Turks). * Although Rashid al-Din was of a family of Jewish origin nevertheless in his correspondence (as well as in the Jami' al-tawarikh) he invariably speaks as an ardent Sunni Muslim and Iranian patriot, an admirer of the Iranian state traditions. * Equally, the state of the Ilkhans was to Rashid al-Din not a Mongol ulus, but \\"the state of Iran\\" (Mamalik-i Ir√£n) (...) * In the Jami' al-tawarikh, a work of semi-official historiography, this Iranian patriotic tendency shows itself only here and there, and then in a disguised form. In his letters Rashid al-Din is more outspoken. There he speaks sharply about the Turks (i. e. the Mongols) as tyrants and oppressors of the Iranian ra'iyyats. Rashid al-Din's dislike for the Turks was also due to the fact that under the last Ilkhans the Mongol-Turkish tribal aristocracy was the main bearer of the centrifugal tendency and a wilful element not always obedient to the central authority in the person of the Ilkhan. In a letter Rashid al-Din calls the Turkish (= Mongol) amirs \\"pure swindlers and accomplices of the devil\\".

Brown was half-brother to the organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown. Life Memorial for Dr. John Brown in St. Giles' Cathedral Brown was the son of the clergyman John Brown (1784‚Äì1858), born in Biggar, Scotland. His mother, Jane Nimmo, died when he was six years old. Brown, who was descended from eminent Presbyterian clergy, was educated at the Edinburgh High School. He graduated with an M. D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1833, and practised as a physician in the city. After qualifying, he was apprenticed to James Syme. Brown subsequently acquired a large medical practice in Edinburgh at a time when infectious diseases took a heavy toll of life. Brown was a sociable man: his house at 23 Rutland Street was the scene of many social gatherings. In 1840 he married Catherine Scott McKay. They had three children, a baby who died shortly after birth (a girl), a daughter, Helen, who was to marry Captain Alexander Laws, and a son \\"Jock\\" Brown. Helen Laws moved to Ireland and outlived her father. However, Jock was to survive into the 20th century and worked hard to pay tribute to his father, collecting all his letters, and working to erect a plaque on his house.‚Äì Text. which remains to this day.Letters of Dr John Brown, edited by his son and U.W. Forrest, with biography by ET McLaren (1907). In 1847 Brown became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and for a while was Honorary Librarian. He held strong views on the inappropriateness of examinations for evaluating student progress and was unimpressed by the view that scientific advances were in patients' best interests. Brown was the friend of many contemporaries, including Thackeray and Mark Twain. His reputation is based on the two volumes of essays, Horae Subsecivae (Leisure Hours) (1858, 1861), John Leech and Other Papers (1882), Rab and His Friends (1859), and Marjorie Fleming: a Sketch (1863) (generally called Pet Marjorie). His first writing was in response to a request for contributions to the notices of paintings exhibited by the Royal Scottish Academy. The editor of the Scotsman newspaper then asked him to write regularly for the paper. He was 48 years old when he published Rab and His Friends. His writings were philosophical, classical, artistic, medical, of rural life, the Jacobite Rebellion, notable characters, humble folk and canine friends. These were published as a collection in 1858 as Hor√¶ Subseciv√¶, which ran to many editions. The first volume deals mainly with the equipment and duties of a physician, the second with subjects outside his profession. Brown was revered and beloved to uncommon degree, and he was the cherished friend of many distinguished contemporaries, including Thackeray. Among those whose writing he encouraged was Henrietta Keddie, then a schoolgirl in Leith, who would become a prolific novelist and writer for children.Henrietta Keddie (1827‚Äì1914) ‚Äì Novelist. In the mingling of tenderness and delicate humour, Brown has much in common with Lamb; in his insight into dog-nature he is unique.

In the late 1990s the chapel became the center of controversy when members of the church decided to conduct a same-sex commitment ceremony. Other events held in the chapel throughout the year, include a Moravian lovefeast during the Christmas season.

Hosted by Al Franken, it featured commentary and interviews arguing for liberal positions on the issues of the day, and comically poking fun at the George W. Bush Administration. The show began as The O'Franken Factor on March 31, 2004. Between January 3, 2006, and February 14, 2007, the show was recorded and broadcast from the 28th floor of the historic Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Prior to that date it was based in New York City. The final show was broadcast on February 14, 2007, the day Franken announced his candidacy for the United States Senate in 2008. Franken is a comedian, satirist and former United States Senator who has written several books, including the 2003 Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. He was a writer and performer on Saturday Night Live, where he usually teamed with fellow writer/performer Tom Davis.  History  Show host Al Franken From the show's inception in March 2004 until October 7, 2005, the show was co-hosted by experienced journalist Katherine Lanpher. Lanpher left the show to write Leap Days, a memoir about her experiences moving to New York City. Lanpher did not rejoin the show because she did not wish to move again when Franken relocated to Minnesota.News & Reviews In November 2005, Franken told an audience in Berkeley, California that he would not seek a replacement for Lanpher. Her departure did not substantially change the content of the show. When the show began, Franken signed a one-year contract. \\"I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected. I'd be happy if the election of a Democrat ended the show\\", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Bush won a second term on November 2, 2004, but Franken stated that the show would continue whether a Democrat or a Republican was in office. Beginning on September 7, 2004, Sundance Channel broadcast a one-hour televised version of the show on weekdays. The show aired its last episode in November 2004. The channel inked a new contract with Franken and aired a second season of the show from June 6, 2005 until early November 2005. On November 15, 2006, Air America affiliate KQKE-AM in San Francisco announced that Franken would leave Air America on December 10, as indicated by an audio clip posted on Whatamockery.com.What a Mockery!: Al Franken leaving Air America on Valentine's Day After December 10, though Franken was still on Air America, KQKE began airing the Thom Hartmann Program in place of the Al Franken Show. On his January 29, 2007, show, Franken announced that his last show on Air America Radio would be that Valentine's Day. Affiliates who carried the Franken show carried Thom Hartmann after that date, while XM Satellite Radio now carries Ed Schultz in that time slot.Al Franken to leave Air America - Radio - nbcnews.com At the end of his final show, Franken announced his intention to run for the United States Senate from Minnesota. The O'Franken Factor Until July 12, 2004 the name of the show was The O'Franken Factor. That name was a jibe at Bill O'Reilly and his The O'Reilly Factor. O'Reilly is widely thought to have instigated Fox News Channel's lawsuit against Franken for using their trademarked phrase \\"fair and balanced\\", which was thrown out of court in summary judgment, but ended up giving publicity to Franken and his book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. Franken said that he chose the title to \\"annoy and bait\\" O'Reilly into suing him again, thus generating additional publicity. That lawsuit never came, and on July 12, 2004, the program was renamed The Al Franken Show. Franken described his show as taking place in a \\"Zero Spin Zone\\" where Franken pledges to tell the truth and there is \\"no spinning allowed.\\" This is a parody of O'Reilly's characterization of the O'Reilly Factor as a \\"No-Spin Zone.\\" Regular guests The show's regular guests included respected progressive issues and current events analysts: Jonathan Alter, David Brock, Joe Conason, John Dickerson, James Fallows, Howard Fineman, Christy Harvey, Paul Krugman, Thomas Oliphant, Norman Ornstein, George Packer, Melanie Sloan, David Sirota, Bernie Sanders, and Lawrence O'Donnell Jr. Regular features In addition to general political discussion, the show featured several recurring comic relief segments. These included: ; Wait Wait‚Ä¶ Don't Lie To Me! : Every Friday afternoon, Franken hosted a mini-game show with fellow judge Joe Conason. The contestant listened to a series of audio clips from earlier in the week, and was asked to identify whether each statement made is the truth, a lie, or a \\"weasel\\" (defined as \\"a statement that is technically true, but intended to mislead\\"). The title was based on the National Public Radio show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! Contestants received a copy of The Al Franken Show Party Album regardless of their performance, though Franken referred to the CD as both the prize for winning and consolation prize for losing. In the spirit of the lying theme, Franken frequently stated that the game won ever increasing numbers of Peabody Awards‚Äîover one hundred by the end of the show‚Äîwhich itself was a humorous dig at Bill O'Reilly, who incorrectly boasted that his former show, Inside Edition, won two Peabodies. The segment's theme music was the 1980s Fleetwood Mac hit song \\"Little Lies\\". ; Hate Email of the Day : Franken picked his favorite hate email and read it on the air, often noting spelling and grammatical errors, and usually concluding with \\"We take your criticisms very seriously.\\" ; Boring Correction : Taking great pride in the veracity of the information cited by his program, Franken invited his audience to bring any factual errors to his attention so they could be addressed. Franken would then issue a live on-air \\"Boring Correction\\" where, to a jaunty tune and the sound of typewriter in the background, he corrected the error. Most of the time, the \\"boring correction\\" addressed a hypertechnicality rather than a substantive error. ; \\"Resident Dittohead\\" Mark Luther : The show regularly featured a segment with Mark Luther, Franken's childhood friend and self-proclaimed dittohead. Franken would play a clip by Rush Limbaugh, take issue with Limbaugh's facts or logic, and argue about it with Luther. ; Good Ribbin' : A correspondent would travel to some of the best southern barbecue hot spots in the country, to talk with people who love barbecue and hate Franken's show. Patrons were invited to tell the audience what they were eating and then argue with Franken. ; The Fifteen Second Debunk : An audio clip was played, and then debunked by another audio clip from the same person. Although the two clips were usually less than fifteen seconds, they were preceded by very lengthy introduction and followed by a lengthy outro. ; Nigel Chestley : Franken played a BBC correspondent who sometimes reported on international news, and other times simply provided an update on the Queen's long running drum solo. ; Senior Moment : Franken played Enid Davenport, a crotchety old woman who offered an extremely confused perspective on the news (she preferred to call the segment \\"A piece of my mind\\"). This character was somewhat reminiscent of Gilda Radner's Emily Litella from Saturday Night Live. ; The Slide Whistle : Franken played a slide whistle along with the highs and lows of President Bush's approval rating since taking office. The whistle started with a moderate note, raised to a high note to reflect the time period following 9/11, then steadily sunk to lower notes as Bush's popularity decreased (with occasional blips of higher notes in between). This was a popular segment surrounding State of the Union addresses. ; Right-Wing Non-Lie of the Day : Franken would play a clip of a conservative telling a \\"non-lie,\\" which would usually last for about ten seconds. On The Very Best of the O'Franken Factor, featured non-lies included Rush Limbaugh saying he was looking at an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal and Bill O'Reilly reading the definition of the word \\"conundrum.\\" Some other skits no longer occurred regularly after Katherine Lanpher left the show. These included: * The Oy Yoy Yoy Show, in which Franken played \\"old Al\\" and responded to a litany of depressing news items by saying \\"Oy\\", along with a constant expression of concern for Israel * Mastication Theater, in which Franken and Lanpher would perform a skit while stuffing their mouths with food Swing State Tour In the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, the show went on a \\"Swing State Tour\\" that included stops in * San Diego, California (though California was not often considered a swing state) * San Francisco, California * Denver, Colorado * Minneapolis, Minnesota * Madison, Wisconsin * Columbus, Ohio * Miami, Florida Music * Theme: Grateful Dead - \\"Terrapin Station\\" (live) * Grateful Dead - \\"Sugaree\\" (live) * Grateful Dead - \\"China Cat Sunflower\\" (live) * Commercial Bumpers: Grateful Dead \\"Going Down the Road Feeling Bad\\" (live) * The Klezmatics - \\"N.Y.

Launched between 1967 and 1988 to monitor NATO and merchant vessels using radar, the satellites were powered by nuclear reactors. Because a return signal from an ordinary target illuminated by a radar transmitter diminishes as the inverse of the fourth power of the distance, for the surveillance radar to work effectively, US-A satellites had to be placed in low Earth orbit. Had they used large solar panels for power, the orbit would have rapidly decayed due to drag through the upper atmosphere. Further, the satellite would have been useless in the shadow of Earth. Hence the majority of the satellites carried type BES-5 nuclear reactors fuelled by uranium-235. Normally the nuclear reactor cores were ejected into high orbit (a so-called \\"disposal orbit\\") at the end of the mission, but there were several failure incidents, some of which resulted in radioactive material re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. The US-A programme was responsible for orbiting a total of 33 nuclear reactors, 31 of them BES-5 types with a capacity of providing about two kilowatts of power for the radar unit. In addition, in 1987 the Soviets launched two larger TOPAZ nuclear reactors (six kilowatts) in Kosmos satellites (Kosmos 1818 and Kosmos 1867) which were each capable of 6 months of operation.Summary of space-based nuclear power systems The higher-orbiting TOPAZ-containing satellites were the major source of orbital contamination for satellites that sensed gamma-rays for astronomical and security purposes, as radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) do not generate significant gamma radiation as compared with unshielded satellite fission reactors, and all of the BES-5-containing spacecraft orbited too low to cause positron- pollution in the magnetosphere.positron pollution from TOPAZ The last US-A satellite was launched 14 March 1988. Incidents * Launch failure, 25 April 1973. Launch failed and the reactor fell into the Pacific Ocean north of Japan. Radiation was detected by US air sampling airplanes. * Kosmos 367 (04564 / 1970-079A), 3 October 1970, failed 110 hours after launch, moved to higher orbit. * Kosmos 954. The satellite failed to boost into a nuclear-safe storage orbit as planned. Nuclear materials re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 24 January 1978 and left a trail of radioactive pollution over an estimated 124,000 square kilometres of Canada's Northwest Territories. * Kosmos 1402. Failed to boost into storage orbit in late 1982. The reactor core was separated from the remainder of the spacecraft and was the last piece of the satellite to return to Earth, landing in the South Atlantic Ocean on 7 February 1983. * Kosmos 1900. The primary system failed to eject the reactor core into storage orbit, but the backup managed to push it into an orbit below its intended altitude.  Other concerns  Although most nuclear cores were successfully ejected into higher orbits, their orbits will still eventually decay. US-A satellites were a major source of space debris in low Earth orbit. The debris is created two ways: *During 16 reactor core ejections, approximately 128 kg of NaK-78 (a fusible alloy eutectic of 22 and 78% w/w sodium and potassium respectively) escaped from the primary coolant systems of the BES-5 reactors. The smaller droplets have already decayed/reentered, but larger droplets (up to 5.5 cm in diameter) are still in orbit. Since the metal coolant was exposed to neutron radiation, it contains some radioactive argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years. The risk of surface contamination is low, as the droplets will burn up completely in the upper atmosphere on re- entry and the argon, a chemically inert gas, will dissipate. The major risk is impact with operational satellites. *An additional mechanism is through the impact of space debris hitting intact contained coolant loops. A number of these old satellites are punctured by orbiting space debris‚Äîcalculated to be 8 percent over any 50-year period‚Äîand release their remaining NaK coolant into space. The coolant self-forms into frozen droplets of solid sodium-potassium of up to around several centimeters in sizeC.

Identity and culture The Janjevci declare as ethnic Croats, and derive their ethnonym (Janjevci) from their traditional community centre, in Janjevo. It is believed that the community descends from migrating merchants from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik and its hinterland) who settled the area in the 14th century, when modern-day Kosovo was part of medieval Serbia. The first written mention of Catholics in Janjevo is a letter written by Pope Benedict XI in 1303, mentioning Janjevo as the center of the Catholic parish of St. Nicholas. Together with the Saxons from Saxony, they worked the Serbian mines. The Croatian population of Shashar√´ is believed to be of partial Saxon origin. They have maintained their Catholic faith until today. The community speaks the Prizren-South Morava dialect. There are currently studies trying to establish a connection between the Janjevci, who left the Republic of Ragusa or Dubrovnik at the same time that another group crossed the Adriatic Sea and settled in Italy, known as Molise Croats who speak Italian language with Slavomolisano dialect. Demographic history Ethnic composition of Kosovo in 1981 according to Yugoslavia census of population with Serb enclaves shown as in 2011. In 1948, there were 5,290 Croats (0.7%) in Kosovo; in 1971 there were 8,264; in 1981 - 8,718 (0.6%); in 1991 - 8,062 (0.4%). During and after the Kosovo War, most of the community had fled to Croatia. 1998 estimations had their number at only 1,800, of which 350 lived in Janjevo. In 2008, there were only 300 Croats estimated to live in Janjevo. In 2011, about 270 Croats lived in the area. The Croatian government has planned to resettle the remaining Janjevci in Kosovo to Croatia. According to the Kosovan 2011 census, there was a total of ca. 400 Janjevci, of whom 80 remain in the Vitina municipality. Janjevci community in Croatia Janjevci families started migrating to SR Croatia, part of Yugoslavia, in the 1950s, mostly settling in Zagreb. By the beginning of the 1970s, there was a large community of Janjevci along and within the vicinity of Konj≈°ƒáinska Street in Dubrava, a district in the eastern part of Zagreb. They have since turned this area into a vibrant shopping district. During the Yugoslav Wars, a significant part of the Janjevci emigrated to Croatia in several waves (1992, 1995, 1997, 1999), and Letniƒçani were settled by the authorities in Voƒáin and ƒêulovac (western Slavonia) and Janjevci in Kistanje (the Dalmatian hinterland) in the abandoned homes of Serbs. In April 2017, 196 displaced Letniƒçani, composed of 41 families who were waiting on homes promised by the state, were finally given newly built houses in the settlement Dumaƒçe, in the municipality of Petrinja https://lokalni.vecernji.hr/zupanije/nakon-18-godina-obitelji- kosovskih-hrvata-primili-kljuceve-kuca-u-naselju-dumace-3642 According to records in 2002, there are 966 families of Janjevci in Croatia, with the majority of them residing in the capital Zagreb (669 families), and the rest in other parts of Croatia (297 families).

The long fjord lies in the municipalities of Strand and Sandnes, about east of the city of Stavanger. The name means light fjord, and is said to be derived from the lightly coloured granite rocks along its sides. It is particularly well known for the huge Preikestolen cliff overlooking the fjord, which is a major tourist destination for the region. The fairly isolated village of Lysebotn lies at the eastern end of the fjord and the villages of Forsand and Oanes both lie at the western end of the fjord near the Lysefjord Bridge, the only crossing of the fjord. Geology The fjord was carved by the action of glaciers in the ice ages and was flooded by the sea when the later glaciers retreated. The geology of Lysefjorden was thoroughly investigated and described by Professor Bj√∏rn G. Andersen in his Master's thesis (1954) (On the glacial retreat in the area between the Lysefjord and the J√∏senfjord in Ryfylke). End to end, it measures with rocky walls falling nearly vertically over into the water. Not only is the fjord long and narrow, it is in places as deep as the mountains are high. Starting at a depth of only deep where it meets the sea near Forsand village, the Lysefjord then heads inland and drops to a depth of over below the Preikestolen. Population Because of the inhospitable, mountainous terrain, the fjord is only lightly populated and only has two villages on its length - Forsand and Lysebotn, located at opposite ends of the fjord. There is a small farming area on the north shore of the fjord, about halfway between the two ends. That farm area is accessible by road from the village of √Ördal over the mountains to the north. There are a few other very small, scattered settlements along the fjord, but those are only accessible by boat along the fjord. There are no roads along the fjord since the sides of the fjord are too steep for roads. Lysebotn, at the far eastern end of the fjord, is largely populated by workers at the nearby hydroelectric plants at Lyse and Tjodan, both built inside the mountains. At the Lyse plant, the water falls to the turbines, producing up to of electricity. At Tjodan, the water falls to yield an output of . The two power plants provide electricity for more than 100,000 people. A spectacular road which rises almost through a series of 27 hairpin bends including a long hairpin tunnel inside the mountain is the only road access to Lysebotn from the outside world.

Transferred in 1822 to the charge of Rose Street church, Edinburgh, he at once took a high rank as a preacher. In 1829 he succeeded James Hall at Broughton Place church, Edinburgh. In. 1835 he was appointed one of the professors in the theological hall of the Secession church. The first in Scotland to use in the pulpit the exegetical method of exposition of Scripture, and as a professor he illustrated the method and extended its use. To him chiefly is due the abandonment of the principle of interpretation according to the analogy of faith, which practically subordinated the Bible to the creed. He had a considerable share in the Apocrypha controversy; and he was throughout life a vigorous and consistent upholder of anti-state-church or voluntary views. He supported the separation of church and state. In Edinburgh an impost called the annuity tax was levied for the support of the city's Church of Scotland ministers. This Brown finally refused to pay, whereupon in 1838 his goods were twice seized and sold. His two sermons on The Law of Christ respecting civil obedience, especially in the payment of tribute, called forth by this grievance and the controversy it engendered, were later published with extensive additions and notes. The part he took in the discussion on the Atonement, which agitated all the Scottish churches, led to a formal charge of heresy against him by those who held the doctrine of a limited atonement. In 1845, after a protracted trial, he was acquitted by the synod. From that time he enjoyed the thorough confidence of his denomination (after 1847 merged in the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland), of which in his later years he was generally regarded as the leading representative. In later life he lived in Arthur Lodge, an impressive Georgian villa in the Newington district.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1855 Family He was married to Jane Nimmo (d.1816).

The Gate of Supreme Harmony (; Manchu: ; M√∂llendorff: amba h≈´waliyambure duka) is the second major gate in the south of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. The gate was originally built during the Ming dynasty, when it was called Fengtianmen (Â•âÂ§©ÈñÄ). Following the Manchu conquest of China, the gate was given its present Chinese and Manchu names.Chinese article on Forbidden City The gate burned down in 1886 due to a fire started by a tipped lamp in the guard room. The present gate dates from the rebuilding after this fire, which was completed in 1894. In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held morning court sessions at the Gate of Supreme Harmony to discuss state affairs with his ministers, although throughout most of the Ming dynasty the court sessions were purely ceremonial, a demonstration of the Emperor's diligence and the status of the titular first minister. In the Qing dynasty, when the Emperor attended court far more frequently, morning court sessions were held at the Gate of Heavenly Purity, which is much closer to the Emperor's living quarters. The Gate of Supreme Harmony was used occasionally for banquets and other ceremonies. The gate is three bays deep and seven bays wide, covering a total area of 1371.4 square metres. It is flanked by two minor gates, Zhendu Gate to the west and Zhaode Gate to the east. The gate and the Meridian Gate form the north and south boundaries of a great plaza that is divided by a serpentine waterway, the Inner River of the Golden Water, which is spanned by a set of five bridges. On the north (inner) side of the gate is Harmony Square, leading to the grand Hall of Supreme Harmony, the ceremonial centre of the Forbidden City. Many incense burners are arrayed around the stairs. The central stairway was reserved exclusively for the Emperor and his immediate attendants, as was the central entrance of Meridian Gate.

History  Randi Rhodes (2008) The Randi Rhodes Show was a local program on WIOD in Miami in 1992 and moved to WJNO in West Palm Beach, Florida in 1994. On March 31, 2004, the program made its national debut on the Air America Radio network. In 2005, the Anti-Defamation League reprimanded Rhodes for comparing Hurricane Katrina refugees with Holocaust victims. The show ran for four hours until September 2006, when it was reduced to three hours.  Suspension  Despite what Air America stated, Randi Rhodes contended that she was not suspended for comments made about Hillary Clinton. In an appearance on Larry King Live following her departure from Air America, Rhodes explained that the reason for her suspension was not really about the stand-up performance, but rather a ploy to force Rhodes to renegotiate her contract. Rhodes alleged that unless she renegotiated her contract to remove a right in her contract that did not allow Air America to fire her, she would never be permitted to return to the air. Air America suspended her until a settlement could be reached concerning the contract which was still in place and had an additional year to run. In the interim, Air America management decided to conduct market research to assess her value to the company. According to Rhodes, it was Air America who issued the press release that called attention to the video of her performance in San Francisco simply as a way to gauge her audience loyalty and her value to the network. According to Rhodes, Air America soon asked her to return to the air, with an offer of more money but still holding to the condition that she had to amend her contract. Rhodes refused and left Air America because of the stalemate over the new contract. On April 9, 2008, Air America Radio CEO Charlie Kireker issued a press release stating that Rhodes was leaving the network, in the aftermath of a brief suspension following a controversial live appearance in San Francisco. One of her affiliates, KKGN in San Francisco, California, immediately announced that they would continue airing her show.  Nova M Radio (2008-09) Randi Rhodes broadcasts from the Democratic National Convention in 2008. On April 10, 2008, Nova M Radio announced that The Randi Rhodes Show would join its radio network, which also syndicated The Mike Malloy Show. During the first broadcast on April 14, 2008, Rhodes went into detail concerning the events surrounding her suspension. She described what happened as \\"a great radio story and I've heard some great radio stories in my day.\\", April 14, 2008 (requires paid subscription) The Randi Rhodes show returned to the airwaves on April 21, 2008 on 23 affiliate stations,Nova M Radio Affiliates, April 15, 2008 compared to Air America's 60 affiliates.Air America Stations , April 15, 2008 As of May 5, 2008, the show was heard on 28 stations, including XM 167, the Air America channel on XM Radio. She also reiterated in this same episode that the issue with Air America was primarily about Air America's new owners demanding her contract be amended to remove her walk-away clause, and that another issue was her high salary. However, Rhodes stopped broadcasting on Nova M on February 3, 2009, with shows hosted by Nancy Skinner until the closing of the network. A statement from one of the Nova M network owners appeared on their official website, but offered no explanation, claiming terms of Rhodes' contract. The Randi Rhodes Show Web site was temporarily inaccessible on February 16, 2009 but returned online later that day with the following statement: Nova M ceased operations a few days later.  Premiere Radio Networks (2009-14) Randi Rhodes and talk show host, Mike Malloy On April 23, 2009, The Randi Rhodes Show became part of the Premiere Radio Networks affiliate network. Premiere announced that Rhodes would be joining the network beginning May 11, 2009, and would air daily in the 3-6 PM Eastern time slot. The show was based out of Washington, D.C. and can be heard on XM Satellite Radio's 'Talk Radio' channel 168. In March 2010, WJNO replaced Rhodes with The Schnitt Show, and WBZT began carrying the Rhodes show live in her local West Palm Beach area. WJNO continues to play Randi Rhodes on tape delay in evenings.

In some cases the reference potential is considered to be that of the surface of the earth, and the reference node is called \\"ground\\" or \\"earth\\" as a consequence. The virtual ground concept aids circuit analysis in operational amplifier and other circuits and provides useful practical circuit effects that would be difficult to achieve in other ways. In circuit theory, a node may have any value of current or voltage but physical implementations of a virtual ground will have limitations of current handling ability and a non-zero impedance which may have practical side effects. Construction A voltage divider, using two resistors, can be used to create a virtual ground node. If two voltage sources are connected in series with two resistors, it can be shown that the midpoint becomes a virtual ground if : \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{out}}{V_\\\\text{in}} = -\\\\frac{R_\\\\text{f}}{R_\\\\text{in}} Op-amp inverting amplifier An active virtual ground circuit is sometimes called a rail splitter. Such a circuit uses an op-amp or some other circuit element that has gain. Since an operational amplifier has very high open-loop gain, the potential difference between its inputs tend to zero when a feedback network is implemented. This means that the output supplies the inverting input (via the feedback network) with enough voltage to reduce the potential difference between the inputs to microvolts. More precisely, it can be shown that the output voltage of the amplifier in the figure is approximately equal to -\\\\frac{R_f}{R_{in}} V_{in}. Thus, as far as the amplifier is working in its linear region (output not saturated, frequencies inside the range of the opamp), the voltage at the inverting input terminal remains constant with respect to the real ground, and independent from the loads to which the output may be connected. This property characterize a \\"virtual ground\\".  Applications  Voltage is a differential quantity, which appears between two points. In order to deal only with a voltage (an electrical potential) of a single point, the second point has to be connected to a reference point (ground). Usually, the power supply terminals serve as steady grounds; when the internal points of compound power sources are accessible, they can also serve as real grounds. If there are not accessible source internal points, external circuit points having steady voltage with respect to the source terminals can serve as artificial virtual grounds. Such a point has to have steady potential, which does not vary when a load is attached.Virtual Ground CircuitsSingle Supply Op AmpsDesigning Single Supply, Low-Power Systems  See also  *Voltage-to-current converter and Current-to-voltage converter show some typical virtual ground applications *Miller theorem applications  References   External links  * Create a Virtual Ground with the LT1118-2.5 Sink/Source Voltage Regulator * Rail Splitter, from Abraham Lincoln to Virtual Ground Application note on creating an artificial virtual ground as a reference voltage. * Creating a Virtual Power Supply Ground * Inverting configuration shows the application of the virtual ground concept in an inverting amplifier * Virtual ground for an inductor of high potential.

Martin Professional is a Danish manufacturer and distributor of stage and architectural lighting and effects fixtures. It is owned by Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. The company is based in Aarhus, Denmark. History The history of Martin began in 1978 when founder Peter Johansen realized how to make a smoke generator from a coffee maker. The company was founded in Aarhus in 1986 and began producing primarily fog machines and a small selection of disco lights in 1987. Its name was acquired through cooperation with a French smoke machine company. In 1993 Martin established Mach, an audio unit. In 1994 the revenue exceeded 100 million Danish kroner and in 1995 the company was listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange raising a net value of 85.5 million Danish kroner. In 1999, Danish industrial firm Schouw & Co. purchased a 60 percent stake in the company. By 2001, Schouw had fully acquired Martin and delisted it from the stock exchange. Martin expanded production in 2002 through a new 11.500 square meter factory in Frederikshavn and a year later the company began outsourcing production to China at a factory in Zhuhai. In 2006 Mach Audio was phased out. Martin enjoyed continued growth until 2008 but was hit hard by the financial crisis and reported a loss of more than 200 million Danish kroner in 2009 and had layoffs of 130 employees at their production sites in Frederikshavn. Continued innovation especially within LED technology has helped the company through the crisis and resulted in several product awards. In 2010 the Confederation of Danish Industries awarded with its annual product price for the MAC 350 Entour LED based automated lighting fixture. The LED technology used in the product was a result of a three-year collaboration with Aalborg University. Furthermore, the MAC Aura luminaire and MAC Viper Profile won the PLASA award for innovation in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Martin started moving its production back to Denmark in the first half of 2012 their factory in Frederikshavn with 26 new employees. The move was made possible by a reduced labor demand in Martins new production lines. Under Harman In 2013 Harman International Industries completed the acquisition of Martin from Schouw. The acquisition did not include the two factories in Frederikshavn, but included an agreement to rent the buildings from Schouw. The acquisition led to the release of the Mach brand which was sold to a cooperation of Canadian and Hong Kong investors. They relaunched the brand under its own company. In August 2015 Harman announced the intention to close the factory in Frederikshavn. The closure was completed on 31 March 2016. Today Martin has been displayed both a number of major international events such as the 2001 Eurovision song contest in Copenhagen, the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and at the Beijing 2008 summer olympics where Martin was the main provider of automated lighting with over 1100 luminaries at the opening ceremony. Furthermore, Martin is one of the chief technology companies in the Aarhus area, and has a strategic partnership with Aarhus University School of Engineering. Products Early on, Martin specialized in fog effect machines; They produced few lighting fixtures. In 1993, the company started producing the Mach series of live sound products, which were quickly discontinued. By 1997, the company realized its full potential as a leading manufacturer in the emerging market of DMX intelligent stage lighting products with the launch of the MAC 500 and 600. Martin's most prominent product to date is the MAC 2000 moving head fixture. It is used primarily by large theaters, concert producers and major television networks and production companies. In addition to moving heads, Martin also manufactures flat mirror and rotating drum-style scanners, strobes, color changers, semi-intelligent effects, LED fixtures, controllers for Intelligent lighting, media servers and a line of smoke machines. Martin's current product line includes the Martin MAC Viper, the LED MAC Quantum series and MAC Aura and the RUSH DJ range, a successor to the Martin Mania range. Another of Martin's current product line is the Era series featuring the era 400 performance,the era 500 hybrid up,the era 600 performance,the era 300 profile and the era 800 performance.

He was an important figure of the Albanian National Awakening and was honoured with the People's Hero of Albania medal. Biography Early life Gurakuqi was born in Shkod√´r, a vilayet center of the Ottoman Empire at the time, on February 19, 1879. He studied at the Jesuit-run St. Xavier College (currently known as Pjet√´r Meshkalla High School), where he was encouraged by teachers like Anton Xanoni and Gasp√´r Jakova M√´rturi. As a student, he wrote poetry in Italian, Latin, and Albanian. In 1897, he left for Italy to study at the Italo‚ÄìAlbanian college of San Demetrio Corone (Collegio of Sant'Adriano) under Girolamo De Rada, who would exercise a strong influence on him. Gurakuqi also studied medicine in Naples for three years, but his interests were focused more on science and the humanities. In Naples, he came into contact with Arb√´resh literary and political figures and published Albanian school texts and a book on prosody. He was also a poet and published under the pen name Jakin Shkodra and Lek√´ Gruda. He published articles in Albania, Drita, Kalendari-komb√´tar, Liria e Shqip√´ris√´, and La Nazione Albanese. Albanian independence In 1908, after the revolution of the Young Turks, Gurakuqi returned definitively to Albania and soon became a leading figure in the nationalist movement, which led to the country's independence in 1912. Together with Gjergj Fishta, he represented the Bashkimi (Unity) literary society of Shkod√´r at the Congress of Monastir in 1908, and, in September 1909, he attended the Congress of Elbasan, which was held to organize Albanian-language teaching and education. When Albania's first teacher-training college, Shkolla Normale (currently known as Aleksand√´r Xhuvani University), was set up in Elbasan on 1 December 1909, Luigj Gurakuqi was appointed its director. Gurakuqi took part in the uprising in the Mal√´sori uprising in 1911, the uprising in southern Albania in 1912, and in March of that year traveled to Skopje and Gjakova to stir up support for open resistance to Turkish rule and the inclusion of Kosovo in a new Albanian state. By September 1912, Gurakuqi and Ismail Qemal bey Vlora traveled to Bucharest to consult with the large Albanian diaspora regarding Albanian geopolitical issues. Gurakuqi took part in the declaration of Albanian independence in Vlora on 28 November 1912 and served as minister of education in the first Albanian government, headed by Ismail Qemal. Austro‚ÄìHungarian occupation In 1915, when his native Shkod√´r was occupied by Montenegrin troops, Gurakuqi was taken prisoner and jailed in Montenegro until after the invasion of Austro‚ÄìHungarian forces. In 1916, he played a role in the Albanian Literary Commission on Albanian orthography, which also served to encourage the publication of Albanian language school texts. During the Austro‚ÄìHungarian occupation of Shkod√´r, he served as director general of education and assisted in establishing about 200 elementary schools. Principality of Albania and Noli's Government In 1918, Gurakuqi was again appointed minister of education in the newly formed Durr√´s government. The following year he attended the Paris Peace Conference. In 1921, he was appointed minister of the interior in the government of Hasan bey Prishtina. In 1924 Gurakuqi was one of the leaders of the revolution that overthrew the regime of Ahmet Zogu and established a democratic government. Fan S. Noli became the new Prime Minister, while Luigj Gurakuqi was part of the new cabinet as Minister of Economy and Finance. in the short-lived government. In August 1924, Gurakuqi traveled to Geneva to defend Albanian interests at the League of Nations, but with the overthrow of Fan Noli's democratic administration by the more authoritarian Zogu forces, he was forced to flee to Italy. Exile and death After the restoration of the Zogist regime, Gurakuqi lived in Bari, Italy, where he was murdered in a caf√© by Baltjon Stambolla. Legacy Monument in Shkod√´r Luigj Gurakuqi served the national cause not only by playing an active role in public life, but also by contributing informative articles to a good number of Albanian periodicals. He was, in addition, the author of both didactic and educational works and of poetry, much of which he published under the pseudonyms Lek Gruda and Jakin Shkodra. A collection of his verse, imbued with the strong patriotic emotion and sentimentality of romantic nationalism, was published posthumously in the 94-page Vjersha (Verse; Bari: Gjikam, 1940), by Gjon Kamsi. Honors Luigj Gurakuqi was awarded the titles Hero i Popullit (Hero of the People) and M√´sues i Popullit (Teacher of the People). The town of Shkodra has always been proud of Luigj Gurakuqi, and on 29 May 1991, it named the newly founded university there after him. A statue of him stands in the center of Shkod√´r.

History The earliest documented use of the term producer in games was by Trip Hawkins, who established the position when he founded Electronic Arts in 1982. Hawkins said in 1983: Sierra On-Line's 1982 computer game Time Zone may be the first to list credits for \\"Producer\\" and \\"Executive Producer\\". As of late 1983 Electronic Arts had five producers: A product marketer and two others from Hawkins' former employer Apple (\\"good at working with engineering people\\"), one former IBM salesman and executive recruiter, and one product marketer from Automated Simulations; it popularized the use of the title in the industry. Hawkins' vision‚Äîinfluenced by his relationship with Jerry Moss‚Äîwas that producers would manage artists and repertoire in the same way as in the music business, and Hawkins brought in record producers from A&M; Records to help train those first producers. Activision made Brad Fregger their first producer in April 1983. Although the term is an industry standard today, it was dismissed as \\"imitation Hollywood\\" by many game executives and press members at the time. Over its entire history, the role of the video game producer has been defined in a wide range of ways by different companies and different teams, and there are a variety of positions within the industry referred to as producer. There are relatively few superstars of game production that parallel those in film, in part because top producers are usually employed by publishers who choose to play down publicizing their contributions. Unlike many of their counterparts in film or music, these producers do not run their own independent companies.  Types of producers  Most video and computer games are developed by third-party developers. In these cases, there may be external and internal producers. External producers may act as \\"executive producers\\" and are employed by the game's publisher. Internal producers work for the developer itself and have more of a hands-on role. Some game developers may have no internal producers, however, and may rely solely on the publisher's producer. For an internal producer, associate producers tend to specialize in an area of expertise depending on the team they are producing for and what skills they have a background in. These specializations include but are not limited to: programming, design, art, sound, and quality assurance. A normal producer is usually the project manager and is in charge of delivering the product to the publisher on time and on budget. An executive producer will be managing all of the products in the company and making sure that the games are on track to meet their goals and stay within the company's goals and direction. For an external producer, their job responsibilities may focus mainly on overseeing several projects being worked on by a number of developers. While keeping updated on the progress of the games being developed externally, they inform the upper management of the publisher of the status of the pending projects and any problems they may be experiencing. If a publisher's producer is overseeing a game being developed internally, their role is more akin to that of an internal producer and will generally only work on one game or a few small games. As games have grown larger and more expensive, line producers have become part of some teams. Based on filmmaking traditions, line producers focus on project scheduling and costing to ensure titles are completed on time and on budget.  Responsibilities  An internal producer is heavily involved in the development of, usually, a single game. Responsibilities for this position vary from company to company, but in general, the person in this position has the following duties: * Negotiating contracts, including licensing deals * Acting as a liaison between the development staff and the upper stakeholders (publisher or executive staff) * Developing and maintaining schedules and budgets * Overseeing creative (art and design) and technical development (game programming) of the game * Ensuring timely delivery of deliverables (such as milestones) * Scheduling timely quality assurance (testing) * Arranging for beta testing and focus groups, if applicable * Arranging for localization * Pitching game ideas to publishers In short, the internal producer is ultimately responsible for timely delivery and final quality of the game. For small games, the producer may interact directly with the programming and creative staff. For larger games, the producer will seek the assistance of the lead programmer, art lead, game designer and testing lead. While it is customary for the producer to meet with the entire development staff from time to time, for larger games, they will only meet with the leads on a regular basis to keep updated on the development status. In smaller studios, a producer may fill any slack in the production team by doing the odd job of writing the game manual or producing game assets. For most games, the producer does not have a large role but does have some influence on the development of the video game design. While not a game designer, the producer has to weave the wishes of the publisher or upper management into the design. They usually seek the assistance of the game designer in this effort. So the final game design is a result the effort of the designer and some influence of the producer.  Compensation  In general, video game producers earn the third most out of game development positions, behind business (marketing/management) and programmers. According to an annual survey of salaries in the industry, producers earn an average of USD$75,000 annually. A video game producer with less than 3 years of experience makes, on average, around $55,000 annually. A video game producer with more than 6 years of experience makes, on average, over $125,000 annually. The salaries of a video game producer will vary depending on the region and the studio. \\"Top Gaming Studios, Schools & Salaries\\". Big Fish Games Education Most video game producers complete a bachelor's degree program in game design, computer science, digital media or business. Popular computer programming languages for video game development include C, C++, Assembly, C# and Java. Some common courses are communications, mathematics, accounting, art, digital modeling and animation. Employers typically require three plus years of experience, since a producer has to have gone through the development cycle several times to really understand how unpredictable the business is. The most common path to becoming a video game producer begins by first working as a game tester, then moving up the quality assurance ladder, and then eventually on to production. This is easier to accomplish if one stays with the same studio, reaping the benefits of having built relationships with the production department.

He was the author of Observationes Medicae which became a standard textbook of medicine for two centuries so that he became known as 'The English Hippocrates'. Among his many achievements was the discovery of a disease, Sydenham's chorea, also known as St Vitus' Dance. Early life Thomas Sydenham was born at Wynford Eagle in Dorset, where his father was a gentleman of property. His brother was Colonel William Sydenham. At the age of eighteen Sydenham attended Magdalen Hall, Oxford; after a short period his college studies appear to have been interrupted, and he served for a time as an officer in the Parliamentarian army during the Civil War. He completed his Oxford course in 1648, graduating as bachelor of medicine, and about the same time he was elected a fellow of All Souls College. It was not until nearly thirty years later (1676) that he graduated as MD, not at Oxford, but at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where his eldest son was by then an undergraduate. After 1648 he seems to have spent some time studying medicine at Oxford, but he was soon back in military service, and in 1654 he received the sum of ¬£600, as a result of a petition he addressed to Oliver Cromwell, pointing out the various arrears due to two of his brothers who had been killed and reminding Cromwell that he himself had also faithfully served the parliament with the loss of much blood. In 1655 he resigned his fellowship at All Souls and married Mary Gee in his home village of Wynford Eagle. They had two sons, William (c.1660‚Äì1738) and Henry (1668?‚Äì1741); another son, James, apparently died young. In 1663 he passed the examinations of the College of Physicians for their licence to practice in Westminster and 6 miles round; but it is probable that he had been settled in London for some time before that. This minimum qualification to practice was the single bond between Sydenham and the College of Physicians throughout the whole of his career. He seems to have been distrusted by some members of the faculty because he was an innovator and something of a plain-dealer. In a letter to John Mapletoft he refers to a class of detractors \\"qui vitio statim vertunt si quis novi aliquid, ab illis non-prius dictum vel etiam inauditum, in medium proferat\\" (\\"Who by a technicality suddenly turn if something is new, if someone should disclose something not previously said or heard\\"); and in a letter to Robert Boyle, written the year before his death (and the only authentic specimen of his English composition that remains), he says, \\"I have the happiness of curing my patients, at least of having it said concerning me that few miscarry under me; but [I] cannot brag of my correspondency with some other of my faculty .... Though yet, in taken fire at my attempts to reduce practice to a greater easiness, plainness, and in the meantime letting the mountebank at Charing Cross pass unrailed at, they contradict themselves, and would make the world believe I may prove more considerable than they would have me.\\" Sydenham attracted to his support some of the most discriminating men of his time, such as Boyle and John Locke. His religious views have been described as an early form of natural theology. Works and innovations Published works Engraving by Abraham Blooteling after the Mary Beale portrait; published as the frontispiece in a later edition of his Observationes medicinae His first book, Methodus curandi febres (The Method of Curing Fevers), was published in 1666; a second edition, with an additional chapter on the plague, in 1668; and a third edition, further enlarged and bearing the better-known title of Observationes mediciae (Observations of Medicine), in 1676. His next publication was in 1680 in the form of two Epistolae responsoriae (Letters & Replies), the one, \\"On Epidemics,\\" addressed to Robert Brady, Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, and the other \\"On the Lues venerea,\\" (On Venereal Diseases) to Henry Paman, public orator at Cambridge and Gresham Professor of Physic in London. In 1682 he published another Dissertatio epistolaris (Dissertation on the Letters), on the treatment of confluent smallpox and on hysteria, addressed to Dr William Cole of Worcester. The Tractatus de podagra et hydrope (The Management of Arthritis and Dropsy) came out in 1683, and the Schedula monitoria de novae febris ingressu (The Schedule of Symptoms of the Newly Arrived Fever) in 1686. His last completed work, Processus integri (The Process of Healing), is an outline sketch of pathology and practice; twenty copies of it were printed in 1692, and, being a compendium, it has been republished more often both in England and in other countries than any other of his writings separately. A fragment on pulmonary consumption was found among his papers. His collected writings occupy about 600 pages 8vo, in the Latin, translated into that language by various scholars. Father of English medicine Opera medica Although Sydenham was a successful practitioner and witnessed, besides foreign reprints, more than one new edition of his various treatises called for in his lifetime, his fame as the father of English medicine, or the English Hippocrates, was posthumous. For a long time he was held in vague esteem for the success of his cooling (or rather expectant) treatment of smallpox, for his laudanum (the first form of a tincture of opium), and for his advocacy of the use of \\"Peruvian bark\\" in quartan agues, in modern terms, the use of quinine-containing cinchona bark for treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium malariae. There were, however, those among his contemporaries who understood something of Sydenham's importance in larger matters than details of treatment and pharmacy, among them Richard Morton and Thomas Browne who owned copies of several of Sydenham's books. But the attitude of the academical medicine of the day is doubtless indicated in Martin Lister's use of the term sectaries for Sydenham and his admirers, at a time (1694) when the leader had been dead five years. If there were any suspicion that the opposition to him was quite other than political, it would be set at rest by the testimony of Dr Andrew Brown, who went from Scotland to inquire into Sydenham's practice and has incidentally revealed what was commonly thought of it at the time, in his Vindicatory Schedule concerning the New Cure of Fevers. In the series of Harveian Orations at the College of Physicians, Sydenham is first mentioned in the oration of Dr John Arbuthnot (1727), who styles him \\"aemulus Hippocratis\\" (\\"rival of Hippocrates\\"). Herman Boerhaave, the Leyden professor, was wont to speak of him in his class (which had always some pupils from England and Scotland) as \\"Angliae lumen, artis Phoebum, veram Hippocratici viri speciem\\" (\\"The light of England, the skill of Apollo, the true face of Hippocrates\\"). Albrecht von Haller also marked one of the epochs in his scheme of medical progress with the name of Sydenham. He is indeed famous because he inaugurated a new method and a better ethics of practice, the worth and diffusive influence of which did not become obvious (except to those who were on the same line with himself, such as Morton) until a good many years afterwards. It remains to consider briefly what his innovations were. First and foremost he did the best he could for his patients, and made as little as possible of the mysteries and traditional dogmas of the craft. Stories told of him are characteristic: Called to a gentleman who had been subjected to the lowering treatment, and finding him in a pitiful state of hysterical upset, he conceived that this was occasioned partly by his long illness, partly by the previous evacuations, and partly by emptiness. \\"I therefore ordered him a roast chicken and a pint of canary.\\" A gentleman of fortune he diagnosed with hypochondria was at length told he could do no more for him, but that there was living at Inverness a certain Dr Robertson who had great skill in cases like his; the patient journeyed to Inverness full of hope, and, finding no doctor of the name there, came back to London full of rage, but cured withal of his complaint. Of a piece with this is his famous advice to Sir Richard Blackmore. When Blackmore first engaged in the study of physic he inquired of Dr Sydenham what authors he should read, and was directed by that physician to Don Quixote, which, said he, \\"is a very good book; I read it still.\\" There were cases, he tells us, in his practice where \\"I have consulted my patients' safety and my own reputation most effectually by doing nothing at all.\\" In 1679, Sydenham gave Whooping cough the name pertussis, meaning a violent cough of any type.Sydenham T: Opera Universa Medica. London: Sydenham Society, 1741 Sydenham was a zealous Puritan and \\"He rejected on religious grounds attempts such as pathological anatomy and microscopic analysis to uncover the hidden causes of disease. He argued God only gave man the ability to perceive the outer nature of things with his senses.\\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/thomassydenham Quotations and Attributions \\"Of all the remedies it has pleased almighty God to give man to relieve his suffering, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium\\" \\"The arrival of a good clown exercises a more beneficial influence upon the health of a town than of twenty asses laden with drugs.\\"Sydenham, Thomas, and Robert Gordon Latham.

Source book of medical history. Vol. 621. Courier Corporation, 1960. page 207 \\"It becomes every man who purposes to give himself to the care of others, seriously to consider the four following things: First, that he must one day give an account to the Supreme Judge of all the lives entrusted to his care. Secondly, that all his skill, and knowledge, and energy as they have been given him by God, so they should be exercised for his glory, and the good of mankind, and not for mere gain or ambition. Thirdly, and not more beautifully than truly, let him reflect that he has undertaken the care of no mean creature, for, in order that he may estimate the value, the greatness of the human race, the only begotten Son of God became himself a man, and thus ennobled it with his divine dignity, and far more than this, died to redeem it. And fourthly, that the doctor being himself a mortal man, should be diligent and tender in relieving his suffering patients, inasmuch as he himself must one day be a like sufferer.\\" The aphorism Primum non nocere (First, do no harm) is attributed to Sydenham in a book written by the English surgeon Thomas Inman.Thomas Inman. Foundation for a New Theory and Practice of Medicine. London: John Churchill, 1860.Inman, T. \\"Foundation for a new theory and practice of medicine (book review).\\" Am J Med Sci 40 (1860): 450‚Äì458. Nosology Sydenham's fundamental idea was to take diseases as they presented themselves in nature and to draw up a complete picture (Krankheitsbild of the Germans) of the objective characters of each. Most forms of ill-health, he insisted, had a definite type, comparable to the types of animal and vegetable species. The conformity of type in the symptoms and course of a malady was due to the uniformity of the cause. The causes that he dwelt upon were the evident and conjunct causes, or, in other words, the morbid phenomena; the remote causes he thought it vain to seek after. Acute diseases, such as fevers and inflammations. he regarded as a wholesome conservative effort or reaction of the organism to meet the blow of some injurious influence operating from without; in this he followed the Hippocratic teaching closely as well as the Hippocratic practice of watching and aiding the natural crises. Chronic diseases, on the other hand, were a depraved state of the humours, mostly due to errors of diet and general manner of life, for which we ourselves were directly accountable. Hence his famous dictum: \\"acutos dico, qui ut plurimum Deum habent authorem, sicut chronici ipsos nos\\" (\\"I say what hurts, most over which God has authority, just like we ourselves over the chronic\\"). Sydenham's nosological method is essentially the modern one, except that it lacked the morbid anatomy part, which was first introduced into the natural history of disease by Morgagni nearly a century later. In both departments of nosology, the acute and the chronic, Sydenham contributed largely to the natural history by his own accurate observation and philosophical comparison of case with case and type with type. The Observationes medicae and the first Epistola responsoria contain evidence of a close study of the various fevers, fluxes and other acute maladies of London over a series of years, their differences from year to year and from season to season, together with references to the prevailing weather, the whole body of observations being used to illustrate the doctrine of the epidemic constitution of the year or season, which he considered to depend often upon inscrutable telluric causes. The type of the acute disease varied, he found, according to the year and season, and the right treatment could not be adopted until the type was known. There had been nothing quite like this in medical literature since the Hippocratic treatise, On Airs, Waters and Places; and there are probably some germs of truth in it still undeveloped, although the modern science of epidemiology has introduced a whole new set of considerations. Among other things Sydenham is credited with the first diagnosis of scarlatina and with the modern definition, of chorea (in Sched. monit.). After smallpox, the diseases to which he refers most are hysteria and gout, his description of the latter (from the symptoms in his own person) being one of the classical pieces of medical writing. While Sydenham's natural history method has doubtless been the chief ground of his great posthumous fame, there can be no question that another reason for the admiration of posterity was that which is indicated by RG Latham, when he says, \\"I believe that the moral element of a liberal and candid spirit went hand in hand with the intellectual qualifications of observation, analysis and comparison.\\" Death Hardly anything is known of Sydenham's personal history in London. He died at his house in Pall Mall on 29 December 1689, aged 65. He is buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly, where a mural slab was put up by the College of Physicians in 1810. A memorial stone dedicated to Thomas can be found halfway up the staircase of St James's Church, Piccadilly. It was put there by the now-defunct 'Sydenham Society'. Biographies Among the lives of Sydenham are one (anonymous) by Samuel Johnson in John Swan's translation of his works (London, 1742), another by C. G. K√ºhn in his edition of his works (Leipzig, 1827), and a third by Robert Gordon Latham in his translation of his works published in London by the Sydenham Society in 1848. See also Fr√©d√©ric Picard, Sydenham, sa vie, ses ≈ìuvres (Paris, 1889), and Joseph Frank Payne, Thomas Sydenham (London, 1900). Dr John Brown's Locke and Sydenham, in Hores subsecivae (Edinburgh, 1858), is of the nature of eulogy. Many collected editions of his works have been published, as well as translations into English, German, French and Italian. William Alexander Greenhill published the Latin text (London, 1844, Syd. Soc.). The most interesting summary of doctrine and practice by the author himself is the introduction to the 3rd edition of Observationes medicae (1676). A colleague, Dr John Browne, described him as \\"the prince of practical medicine, whose character is as beautiful and as genuinely English as his name\\".

Many of the world's classic board games, including chess, Go, checkers and draughts, xiangqi (Chinese chess), shogi (Japanese chess), Reversi (marketed as \\"Othello\\"), nine men's morris, and most mancala variants, fit into this category, as do more modern iterations such as Dameo, Hive, and YINSH . As J. Mark Thompson wrote in his article \\"Defining the Abstract\\", play is sometimes said to resemble a series of puzzles the players pose to each other: > There is an intimate relationship between such games and puzzles: every > board position presents the player with the puzzle, What is the best move?, > which in theory could be solved by logic alone. A good abstract game can > therefore be thought of as a \\"family\\" of potentially interesting logic > puzzles, and the play consists of each player posing such a puzzle to the > other. Good players are the ones who find the most difficult puzzles to > present to their opponents. Many abstract strategy games also happen to be \\"combinatorial\\"; i.e., there is no hidden information, no non-deterministic elements (such as shuffled cards or dice rolls), no simultaneous or hidden movement or setup, and (usually) two players or teams take a finite number of alternating .  Definition  Combinatorial games have no randomizers such as dice, no simultaneous movement, nor hidden information. Some games that do have these elements are sometimes classified as abstract strategy games. (Games such as Continuo, Octiles, Can't Stop, and Sequence, could be considered abstract strategy games, despite having a luck or bluffing element.) A smaller category of abstract strategy games manages to incorporate hidden information without using any random elements; the best known example is Stratego. Traditional abstract strategy games are often treated as a separate game category, hence the term 'abstract games' is often used for competitions that exclude them and can be thought of as referring to modern abstract strategy games. Two examples are the IAGO World Tour (2007‚Äì2010) and the Abstract Games World Championship held annually since 2008 as part of the Mind Sports Olympiad. Some abstract strategy games have multiple starting positions of which it is required that one be randomly determined. For a game to be one of skill, a starting position needs to be chosen by impartial means. Some games, such as Arimaa and DVONN, have the players build the starting position in a separate initial phase which itself conforms strictly to combinatorial game principles. Most players, however, would consider that although one is then starting each game from a different position, the game itself contains no luck element. Indeed, Bobby Fischer promoted randomization of the starting position in chess in order to increase player dependence on thinking at the board.  Comparison  Analysis of \\"pure\\" abstract strategy games is the subject of combinatorial game theory. Abstract strategy games with hidden information, bluffing, or simultaneous move elements are better served by Von Neumann‚ÄìMorgenstern game theory, while those with a component of luck may require probability theory incorporated into either of the above. As for the qualitative aspects, ranking abstract strategy games according to their interest, complexity, or strategy levels is a daunting task and subject to extreme subjectivity. In terms of measuring how finite a mathematical field each of the three top contenders represents, it is estimated that checkers has a game-tree complexity of 1031 possible positions, whereas chess has approximately 10123. This suggests that computer programs, through brute force calculation alone, should often be able to surpass human players' abilities.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 15,769. History Much of what is now the northern part of the town was held by the Moleyns family from at least 1369, but in 1429 William Lord Moleyns was killed at the siege of Orl√©ans and the land passed to the Hungerford family. During the mediaeval period the main road through Carterton was one of the most important in the country, taking trains of packhorses laden with Cotswold wool over Radcot Bridge and on to Southampton for export to the weaving centres of Europe. In the 1770s the land was acquired by the Duke of Marlborough. The pattern of the present settlement dates from 1894 when part of the estate was sold to Homesteads Limited whose director was William Carter. The land was divided into plots of 6 acres and sold for ¬£20 an acre with bungalows costing from ¬£120. Many of the settlers were retired soldiers and people moving from the towns. Carterton soon made its name in the market gardening world. Black grapes from Frenchester Nurseries and the famous Carterton tomatoes were sold at Covent Garden Market. Carterton, which by the late 20th century was one of the largest towns in Oxfordshire, was founded soon after 1900 as a colony of smallholders, on agricultural land in the northern part of Black Bourton parish. The founder was William Carter of Branksome (Dorset), a speculator who, through his company Homesteads Ltd of London, bought estates in several counties, in order to establish smallholdings and attract people back to the land. In Oxfordshire he acquired from W. C. Arkell, in 1900, the 740-a. Rock farm north of Black Bourton village, part of an estate sold by the duke of Marlborough in 1894. By late 1902 there were 16 houses, and the following year the new settlement, already called Carterton, was included in a local trades directory.  Development from the Second World War  Carterton's later growth was closely related to the expansion of Brize Norton airbase, and profoundly altered the settlement's character. A small group of substantial two-storey houses for RAF personnel, called Brizewood, was built east of Swinbrook Road about 1938, and in the 1950s was expanded with uniform bungalows for American servicemen. By 1953 Carterton was a \\"busy and expanding village\\", and its rapid population increase was creating severe housing problems: in 1962 the plight of significant numbers of caravan dwellers prompted an article in the Lancet, though many residents took exception to the town's portrayal, and denied that the picture was typical. By then there were claimed to be more civilians than servicemen living in mobile homes, some of them single women, and the \\"shack- like houses of the early settlers\\", their \\"meagre appearance [bearing] eloquen\\" elsewhere on the \\"busy village main street\\". A few scattered \\"Robin\\" hangars, hastily built during the Second World War to allow aircraft to be housed away from the airfield itself, were converted to other uses during the same period, one on Alvescot Road surviving in the early 21st century as part of a motor repair garage. In 1967 an ambitious scheme was launched for controlled expansion and for regeneration of the town centre, with a ring road (Upavon Way) to serve new housing, to divert traffic from the centre, and to contain future expansion. New RAF housing was to provide over 1,450 dwellings and private enterprise another 300, while local authorities were to provide shops and other much needed facilities around the central crossroads. By 1976 over 2,000 houses had been built since the 1960s, those on the large RAF estates in the north-east mostly of uniform appearance with concrete exteriors, and 850 more were planned. Settlement by then spilled over the parish boundary into Brize Norton, though on the north there was no expansion beyond the parish boundary, and expansion south of Milestone Road was constrained by the airfield perimeter. A large transit hotel within the airfield precinct was built by the RAF in 1970 to serve military personnel and their families. The number of people in mobile homes still caused controversy in 1980, when there were almost 250 permanent or temporary pitches distributed among several sites, and in the early 1980s some sites were closed and replaced by council houses. Expansion in the town's eastern part, chiefly for housing, continued in the mid 1980s. A reduced scheme for the town centre was launched in 1975 after repeated delays and controversy, and Upavon Way was opened soon after. By 1997 the town centre had been transformed: shops in a variety of styles lined the four broad main streets, interspersed with a few older buildings such as the Beehive Hotel and the former Emporium, and the crossroads was dominated by a tall domed tower built in 1996, surmounting new shops and offices. A large Co-operative Society supermarket of flamboyant design, on the site of the earlier building on Black Bourton Road, was erected in 1998, and in 2000 work began on a major expansion programme on the town's eastern edge, to include another 1,200 houses, a shopping centre, leisure facilities, and a new access road. Rock Farm and its converted agricultural buildings, all stone-built, survived as a small group at the intersection of Lawton and Arkell Avenues, with William Wilkinson's pair of model labourers' cottages set back from the Alvescot road between modern housing. A variety of early settlers' houses also survived scattered among the modern buildings, though by 2004 several had been recently demolished or were semiderelict and under threat from developers, prompting mounting local controversy.  Public buildings and social provision  Early institutional buildings included a Methodist chapel (1907), a Roman Catholic church (1914), an Anglican mission church (c. 1915), and a school (1928), all initially on Burford Road. A post office was opened south of Brize Norton Road before 1907, moving in the 1920s to a single-storey corrugated-iron building at the crossroads, later to premises on Black Bourton Road, and in the 1980s to Brize Norton Road. It became a money order and telegraph office about 1930. In 1970 another post office opened in the town's north-eastern part, but the postal service was thought inadequate and there were repeated requests for a Crown Post Office. A branch of the London and Midland (later Midland) Bank opened before 1924, and a branch of Barclays Bank before 1928;, both were still open in the 1990s. A two-storey police house was built north-east of the crossroads around 1916 on land owned by Oxfordshire County Council, and Carterton had a resident police constable thereafter. In the late 1960s a new police station was built on Burford Road for a staff of eight, together with six police houses, and the original police house was demolished. A war memorial erected at the crossroads about 1920 was moved to the new town hall on Alvescot Road in the early 1980s. The Emporium included an upstairs room for meetings and social events, and a large, corrugated-iron Women's Institute hall on Brize Norton Road, erected in 1926 and still in use in 2004, hosted lectures, meetings, and dances. (fn. 56) A reading room mentioned in 1917 was succeeded by a small library also in part of the former Emporium. (fn. 57) Refreshment rooms were mentioned in 1924, the Beehive Hotel on Burford Road was opened in 1932, and the Golden Eagle (renamed the Olde Aviator in 1996) was opened in the former Emporium in 1954. Land for a recreation ground north of Alvescot Road was given by Carter in 1906, and football, cricket, tennis, and bowls clubs were formed around 1920, together with a choral society. From 1904 to the 1920s there was a resident physician, and in 1928 a solicitor visited once a week. After the Second World War social and leisure provision failed to keep pace with Carterton's rapid expansion: in 1962 there was a midwife but no doctor, chemist, or health visitor, (fn. 61) and in the mid 1970s, when there were only three public houses and wholly inadequate shops, public spaces, and playing fields, Carterton was dismissed by one resident as not a town but a \\"collection of people with no facilities\\". (fn. 62) New buildings erected between 1967 and the 1980s, besides schools, included a social centre north of Alvescot Road, built in 1968 on land given two years earlier for a village hall, a health centre, and, in 1986, a branch library. A swimming pool was built east of Swinbrook Road in 1974, and in 1981 a football club house was built between Swinbrook and Shilton Roads. (fn. 63) A youth centre was established in Allandale House by the county council about 1968, and accommodated several community groups in the late 1970s. (fn. 64) A town hall was built south of Alvescot Road in 1982‚Äì3 following adoption of town status a few years earlier, and a new leisure centre and swimming pool was opened in 2003, though more sports and leisure facilities were still felt to be needed. ¬∂By the late 1970s such initiatives were said to be fostering an increased sense of communal identity. An annual carnival and outdoor Christmas festivities were attended by several thousand, and annual St George's day celebrations were introduced in 1985. (fn. 67) Relations between civilians and the RAF, on which the town continued to depend economically, remained less close, encouraging perceptions of two separate communities. Nevertheless there were occasional joint activities and some joint societies, the RAF allowing civilians to use some of its leisure and shopping facilities, and cooperating with the chamber of commerce. In summer 1974 an outdoor swimming pool opened in Swinbrook Road; it closed in summer 2003 as it was uneconomic and the new leisure Centre was to open in November 2003. Construction work on RAF Brize Norton began in 1935. Wartime saw the rapid growth of the base. An air raid destroyed 46 aircraft; the remainder were then dispersed round the village and one hangar which is now an Aldi supermarket on the Alvescot Road. From 1950 to 1965 the camp was to be the home of the USAF bomber wings. The RAF returned in 1965 and undertook a large building programme, making RAF Brize Norton its main air transport base in the country. With the growth of the village, the small mission church at the central crossroads was replaced in 1963 by the church of St John the Evangelist. The link with the mother church of St. Mary's at Black Bourton was kept alive by the donation of one of the bells from the tower. This was made by H. Knight of Reading and is dated 1619. Koi fishpond floor mosaic in Tower Square, Carterton. Commissioned by the Town Council in 2008 by artist Gary Drostle. In the first decade of the 21st century, the new Shilton Park development in Northeast Carterton was built, providing a mix of housing for private ownership and social letting. The new St. John's Church of England primary school has been built at Shilton Park and construction of a local shopping centre is now complete. The oldest school is Carterton Primary School which has been in Burford Road since 1926 and the Carterton Community College opened in 1971 Since the 1980s the North east side of Carterton has been developed with three new housing estates, Glenmore park, Shilton Park and Swinbrook Park of which development commenced in 2014 and will be completed in 2019. Military repatriations A new Memorial Garden has been built near the town to continue the public mourning seen at Royal Wootton Bassett as military repatriations for dead service personnel have now been routed to Brize Norton. Education Carterton has five primary schools: *Carterton Primary School,Carterton Primary School *Edith Moorhouse Primary School,Edith Moorhouse Primary School *The Gateway Primary School,Gateway Primary School *St John the Evangelist Church of England Primary SchoolSt John the Evangelist CE Primary School and *St Joseph's Catholic Primary School.St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Carterton St. John the Evangelist and St. Joseph's are voluntary controlled schools.

Sport and leisure Carterton has a Non-League football team Carterton F.C. who play at Kilkenny Lane. Carterton has a squash club, with two heated courts, changing rooms and a bar/social area. Retail There are a number of shops, and supermarket chains Asda, Morrisons and Aldi have stores with car parking in the town centre. There are plans to improve and expand the retail space in the centre and create more car parking. As a result, new chains such as The Original Factory Shop have recently opened in the town. West Oxfordshire Retail Park and a new business park are being built in the town. The Countryside Agency has awarded Carterton Beacon Status for the work that the Fast Forward team is undertaking on the regeneration of the town centre. Housing The town of Carterton has a varied mix of housing. The new development of Shilton Park has added many more houses to the current stock. Mayor The grandfather of Theo Walcott was the Mayor of Carterton from 2001‚Äì2004. Windell \\"Joe\\" Walcott was awarded an MBE in 2006 for his services to the community in Carterton and West Oxfordshire.

Depending on the requirements, a digital control system can take the form of a microcontroller to an ASIC to a standard desktop computer. Since a digital computer is a discrete system, the Laplace transform is replaced with the Z-transform. Also since a digital computer has finite precision (See quantization), extra care is needed to ensure the error in coefficients, analog-to-digital conversion, digital-to-analog conversion, etc. are not producing undesired or unplanned effects. The application of digital control can readily be understood in the use of feedback. Since the creation of the first digital computer in the early 1940s the price of digital computers has dropped considerably, which has made them key pieces to control systems for several reasons: *Cheap: under $5 for many microcontrollers *Flexible: easy to configure and reconfigure through software *Scalable: programs can scale to the limits of the memory or storage space without extra cost *Adaptable: parameters of the program can change with time (See adaptive control) *Static operation: digital computers are much less prone to environmental conditions than capacitors, inductors, etc.  Digital controller implementation  A digital controller is usually cascaded with the plant in a feedback system. The rest of the system can either be digital or analog. Typically, a digital controller requires: *Analog-to-digital conversion to convert analog inputs to machine-readable (digital) format *Digital-to-analog conversion to convert digital outputs to a form that can be input to a plant (analog) *A program that relates the outputs to the inputs  Output program  *Outputs from the digital controller are functions of current and past input samples, as well as past output samples - this can be implemented by storing relevant values of input and output in registers. The output can then be formed by a weighted sum of these stored values. The programs can take numerous forms and perform many functions *A digital filter for low-pass filtering *A state space model of a system to act as a state observer *A telemetry system  Stability  Although a controller may be stable when implemented as an analog controller, it could be unstable when implemented as a digital controller due to a large sampling interval. During sampling the aliasing modifies the cutoff parameters. Thus the sample rate characterizes the transient response and stability of the compensated system, and must update the values at the controller input often enough so as to not cause instability. When substituting the frequency into the z operator, regular stability criteria still apply to discrete control systems. Nyquist criteria apply to z-domain transfer functions as well as being general for complex valued functions. Bode stability criteria apply similarly. Jury criterion determines the discrete system stability about its characteristic polynomial.  Design of digital controller in s-domain  The digital controller can also be designed in the s-domain (continuous). The Tustin transformation can transform the continuous compensator to the respective digital compensator. The digital compensator will achieve an output that approaches the output of its respective analog controller as the sampling interval is decreased. s = \\\\frac{2(z-1)}{T(z+1)}  Tustin transformation deduction  Tustin is the Pad√©(1,1) approximation of the exponential function \\\\begin{align} z &= e^{sT} \\\\end{align} : : \\\\begin{align} z &= e^{sT} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{e^{sT/2}}{e^{-sT/2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx \\\\frac{1 + s T / 2}{1 - s T / 2} \\\\end{align} And its inverse : \\\\begin{align} s &= \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\ln(z) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{2}{T} \\\\left[\\\\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\\\right)^3 + \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\left( \\\\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\\\right)^5 + \\\\frac{1}{7} \\\\left( \\\\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\\\right)^7 + \\\\cdots \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\approx \\\\frac{2}{T} \\\\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{2}{T} \\\\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}} \\\\end{align} Digital control theory is the technique to design strategies in discrete time, (and/or) quantized amplitude (and/or) in (binary) coded form to be implemented in computer systems (microcontrollers, microprocessors) that will control the analog (continuous in time and amplitude) dynamics of analog systems.

It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength. The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of price movements. Momentum is the rate of the rise or fall in price. The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher closes to lower closes: stocks which have had more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks which have had more or stronger negative changes. The RSI is most typically used on a 14-day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively. Shorter or longer timeframes are used for alternately shorter or longer outlooks. More extreme high and low levels‚Äî80 and 20, or 90 and 10‚Äîoccur less frequently but indicate stronger momentum. The relative strength index was developed by J. Welles Wilder and published in a 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, and in Commodities magazine (now Futures magazine) in the June 1978 issue.J. Welles Wilder, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, It has become one of the most popular oscillator indices. The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought. RSI with recommended parameters and its day-to- day optimization was tested and compared with other strategies in Marek and ≈†ediv√° (2017). The testing was randomised in time and companies (e.g., Apple, Exxon Mobile, IBM, Microsoft) and showed that RSI can still produce good results; however, in longer time it is usually overcome by the simple buy-and- hold strategy. Calculation For each trading period an upward change U or downward change D is calculated. Up periods are characterized by the close being higher than the previous close: : U = \\\\text{close}_\\\\text{now} - \\\\text{close}_\\\\text{previous} :D = 0 Conversely, a down period is characterized by the close being lower than the previous period's close (note that D is nonetheless a positive number), : U = 0 : D = \\\\text{close}_\\\\text{previous} - \\\\text{close}_\\\\text{now} If the last close is the same as the previous, both U and D are zero. The average U and D are calculated using an n-period smoothed or modified moving average (SMMA or MMA) which is an exponentially smoothed Moving Average with Œ± = 1/period. Some commercial packages, like AIQ, use a standard exponential moving average (EMA) as the average instead of Wilder's SMMA. Wilder originally formulated the calculation of the moving average as: newval = (prevval * (period - 1) + newdata) / period. This is fully equivalent to the aforementioned exponential smoothing. New data is simply divided by period which is equal to the alpha calculated value of 1/period. Previous average values are modified by (period -1)/period which in effect is period/period - 1/period and finally 1 - 1/period which is 1 - alpha. The ratio of these averages is the relative strength or relative strength factor: : RS = \\\\frac{\\\\text{SMMA}(U,n)}{\\\\text{SMMA}(D,n)} If the average of D values is zero, then according to the equation, the RS value will approach infinity, so that the resulting RSI, as computed below, will approach 100. The relative strength factor is then converted to a relative strength index between 0 and 100: : RSI = 100 - { 100 \\\\over {1 + RS} } The smoothed moving averages should be appropriately initialized with a simple moving average using the first n values in the price series. Interpretation Basic configuration Relative strength index 7-period The RSI is presented on a graph above or below the price chart. The indicator has an upper line, typically at 60, a lower line at 40, and a dashed mid-line at 50. Wilder recommended a smoothing period of 14 (see exponential smoothing, i.e. Œ± = 1/14 or N = 14). Principles Wilder posited that when price moves up very rapidly, at some point it is considered overbought. Likewise, when price falls very rapidly, at some point it is considered oversold. In either case, Wilder deemed a reaction or reversal imminent. The level of the RSI is a measure of the stock's recent trading strength. The slope of the RSI is directly proportional to the velocity of a change in the trend. The distance traveled by the RSI is proportional to the magnitude of the move. Wilder believed that tops and bottoms are indicated when RSI goes above 70 or drops below 30. Traditionally, RSI readings greater than the 70 level are considered to be in overbought territory, and RSI readings lower than the 30 level are considered to be in oversold territory. In between the 30 and 70 level is considered neutral, with the 50 level a sign of no trend. Divergence Wilder further believed that divergence between RSI and price action is a very strong indication that a market turning point is imminent. Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high, thus failing to confirm. Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a new low but RSI makes a higher low. Overbought and oversold conditions Wilder thought that \\"failure swings\\" above 70 and below 30 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals. For example, assume the RSI hits 76, pulls back to 72, then rises to 77. If it falls below 72, Wilder would consider this a \\"failure swing\\" above 70. Finally, Wilder wrote that chart formations and areas of support and resistance could sometimes be more easily seen on the RSI chart as opposed to the price chart. The center line for the relative strength index is 50, which is often seen as both the support and resistance line for the indicator. If the relative strength index is below 50, it generally means that the stock's losses are greater than the gains. When the relative strength index is above 50, it generally means that the gains are greater than the losses. ''' Uptrends and downtrends In addition to Wilder's original theories of RSI interpretation, Andrew Cardwell has developed several new interpretations of RSI to help determine and confirm trend. First, Cardwell noticed that uptrends generally traded between RSI 40 and 80, while downtrends usually traded between RSI 60 and 20. Cardwell observed when securities change from uptrend to downtrend and vice versa, the RSI will undergo a \\"range shift.\\" Example of RSI Indicator Divergence Next, Cardwell noted that bearish divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends, and 2) mostly only leads to a brief correction instead of a reversal in trend. Therefore, bearish divergence is a sign confirming an uptrend. Similarly, bullish divergence is a sign confirming a downtrend. Reversals Finally, Cardwell discovered the existence of positive and negative reversals in the RSI. Reversals are the opposite of divergence. For example, a positive reversal occurs when an uptrend price correction results in a higher low compared to the last price correction, while RSI results in a lower low compared to the prior correction. A negative reversal happens when a downtrend rally results in a lower high compared to the last downtrend rally, but RSI makes a higher high compared to the prior rally. In other words, despite stronger momentum as seen by the higher high or lower low in the RSI, price could not make a higher high or lower low. This is evidence the main trend is about to resume. Cardwell noted that positive reversals only happen in uptrends while negative reversals only occur in downtrends, and therefore their existence confirms the trend. Cutler's RSI A variation called Cutler's RSI is based on a simple moving average of U and D,Cutler's RSI page at Aspen Graphics Technical Analysis Software instead of the exponential average above.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 6,337. History Pre-1800 St Mary the Virgin parish church, rebuilt circa 1485 The Rollright Stones, a stone circle north of Chipping Norton, is evidence of prehistoric habitation in the area. The town's name means 'market north town', with \\"Chipping\\" (from Old English cƒìping) meaning 'market'. Chipping Norton began as a small settlement at the foot of a hill on which stand the motte-and-bailey Chipping Norton Castle. Only the earthworks of the castle remain. The Church of England parish church of St. Mary the Virgin was built on the hill next to the castle. Parts of the present building may date from the 12th century. It retains features from the 13th and 14th centuries. The nave was largely rebuilt in about 1485 with a Perpendicular Gothic clerestory. This rebuilding is believed to have been funded by John Ashfield, a wool merchant, making St. Mary's an example of a \\"wool church\\". In July 1549 the vicar of Chipping Norton, Henry Joyes or Joyce, led parishioners in a popular rising after the suppression of chantries and other religious reforms left him to minister alone to a congregation of 800, and reduced the budget for schooling.Beer, Rebellion and Riot, Kent State UP, p.150 The rising was brutally put down by Lord Grey de Wilton; Joyes was captured and subsequently hanged in chains from the tower of his own church.A. Vere Woodman, \\"The Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Rising of 1549\\", Oxoniensia, XXII, 82-83 The bell tower was rebuilt in 1825.Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin The tower has a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1907 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. St Mary's has also a Sanctus bell cast in 1624 by Roger I Purdue of Bristol. In the Middle Ages wool made the Cotswolds one of the wealthiest parts of England. Many mediaeval buildings built in the town as a result of that trade survive. They became the centre of town and remain so. There is still a market every Wednesday and the mop fair, when the High Street is closed to through traffic, in September. In 1205 a new market place was laid out higher up the hill. Sheep farming was largely displaced by arable but agriculture remained important in this part of the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Many of the original houses around the market place were re-faced in the 18th century with fashionable Georgian facades. Chipping Norton Almshouses, founded in 1640 An inscription on the almshouses records that they were founded in 1640 as \\"The work and gift of Henry Cornish, gent\\". Post-1800 In 1796 James and William Hitchman founded Hitchman's Brewery in West Street. In 1849 the business built a larger brewery in Albion Street that included a malthouse and its own water wells. Three generations of Hitchmans ran the brewery, but in 1890 Alfred Hitchman sold the business as a limited company. The new company grew by buying other breweries in 1891 and 1917. In 1924 it merged with Hunt Edmunds of Banbury, and in 1931 Hunt Edmunds Hitchmans closed the brewery in Chipping Norton.Hitchman's Brewery history. Webcitation.org. Retrieved on 24 August 2011. Other industries in the town included a woollen mill (see below), a glove-making factory, a tannery and an iron foundry. Chipping Norton had a workhouse by the 1770s. In 1836 the architect George Wilkinson built a new, larger workhouse. It had four wings radiating from an octagonal central building, similar to Witney workhouse, which Wilkinson was also building. The architect G. E. Street added a chapel to Chipping Norton workhouse in 1856‚Äì57. It ceased to be a workhouse in 1929 and became a hospital in the Second World War. The National Health Service took it over in 1948, making it Cotshill Hospital, which later served as a psychiatric hospital. The hospital closed in 1983.Cotshill Hospital history .

Chipping Norton Town Hall, built in 1842 Chipping Norton was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Its neoclassical town hall was built in 1842. Holy Trinity Roman Catholic church is also neoclassical. It was built in 1836 by the architect John Adey Repton, a grandson of the English garden designer Humphry Repton. Chipping Norton railway station, opened in 1855, pictured here in the early 1900s The Chipping Norton Railway opened in 1855, linking the town with on the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway. In 1887 a second railway opened, linking Chipping Norton to the Oxford and Rugby Railway at , and the CNR became part of the resulting Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. Extending the railway from Chipping Norton involved digging a tunnel long under Elmsfield Farm west of town. In 1951 British Railways withdrew passenger services between Chipping Norton and . In 1962 BR closed Chipping Norton railway station and withdrew passenger services between Chipping Norton and Kingham. In 1964 BR closed the B&CDR; to freight and dismantled the line. The disused railway tunnel is bricked up at both ends for safety and to protect any bats inside. (See Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981) Bliss Mill, built in 1872 In May 1873 rioting took place following the conviction and sentencing of the Ascott Martyrs, 16 local women accused of trying to interfere with strikebreakers at a farm. Bliss Tweed Mill, on the west of town, was built as a tweed mill by William Bliss in 1872. In 1913 to 1914 the millworkers struck for eight months. The mill closed in 1980 and has been converted into flats. It remains a landmark, visible from Worcester Road. The town lost its status as a municipal borough in 1974, when the Local Government Act 1972 made it a successor parish within the district of West Oxfordshire. Governance Chipping Norton is in the Witney parliamentary constituency. The Member of Parliament for Witney from 2001 to 2016 was David Cameron, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2016 and the leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. Since 2016 the MP for Witney has been the Conservative Robert Courts.

His most significant literary contribution, the monumental five-volume On the Seats and Causes of Disease, embodied a lifetime of experience in anatomical dissection and observation, and established the fundamental principle that most diseases are not vaguely dispersed throughout the body, but originate locally, in specific organs and tissues. Education His parents were in comfortable circumstances, but not of the nobility; it appears from his letters to Giovanni Maria Lancisi that Morgagni had ambitions to improve his rank. It may be inferred that he succeeded from the fact that he is described on a memorial tablet at Padua as nobilis forolensis, \\"noble of Forl√¨\\", apparently by right of his wife. At the age of sixteen he went to Bologna to study philosophy and medicine, and graduated with much praise as a doctor in both faculties three years later, in 1701. He acted as prosector to Antonio Maria Valsalva (one of the distinguished pupils of Malpighi), who held the office of demonstrator anatomicus in the Bologna school, and whom he assisted more particularly in preparing his celebrated work on the Anatomy and Diseases of the Ear, published in 1704. Career Early career Many years after, in 1740, Morgagni edited a collected edition of Valsalva's writings, with important additions to the treatise on the ear, and with a memoir of the author. When Valsalva was transferred to Parma Morgagni succeeded to his anatomical demonstratorship. At this period he enjoyed a high repute in Bologna; he was made president of the Academia Enquietorum when in his twenty-second year, and he is said to have signalized his tenure of the presidential chair by discouraging abstract speculations, and by setting the fashion towards exact anatomical observation and reasoning. He published the substance of his communications to the Academy in 1706 under the title of Adversaria anatomica, the first of a series by which he became favorably known throughout Europe as an accurate anatomist; the book included Observations of the Larynx, the Lachrymal Apparatus, and the Pelvic Organs in the Female. After a time he gave up his post at Bologna, and occupied himself for the next two or three years at Padua, where he had a friend in Domenico Guglielmini (1655‚Äì1710), professor of medicine, but better-known as a writer on physics and mathematics, whose works he afterwards edited (1719) with a biography. Guglielmini desired to see him settled as a teacher at Padua, and the unexpected death of Guglielmini himself made the project feasible, Antonio Vallisneri (1661‚Äì1730) being transferred to the vacant chair, and Morgagni succeeding to the chair of theoretical medicine. He came to Padua in the spring of 1712, being then in his thirty-first year, and he taught medicine there with the most brilliant success until his death on 6 December 1771.  Middle career  When he had been three years in Padua, which at the time was part of the Republic of Venice, an opportunity occurred for his promotion (by the Venetian senate) to the chair of anatomy. In this prestigious position he became the successor of an illustrious line of scholars, including Vesalius, Gabriele Falloppio, Geronimo Fabrizio, Gasserius, and Adrianus Spigelius, and enjoyed a stipend that was increased from time to time by vote of the senate until it reached twelve hundred gold ducats. Shortly after coming to Padua he married a noble lady of Forl√¨, who bore him three sons and twelve daughters. Morgagni enjoyed an unequaled popularity among all classes. He was of tall and dignified figure, with blonde hair and lilac eyes, and with a frank and happy expression; his manners were polished, and he was noted for the elegance of his Latin style. He lived in harmony with his colleagues, who are said not even to have envied him his unprecedentedly large stipend; his house and lecture-theatre were frequented tanquam officina sapientiae by students of all ages, attracted from all parts of Europe; he enjoyed the friendship and favor of distinguished Venetian senators and of cardinals; and successive popes conferred honours upon him. Before he had been long in Padua the students of the German nation, of all the faculties there, elected him their patron, and he advised and assisted them in the purchase of a house to be a German library and club, for all time. He was elected into the imperial Caesareo-Leopoldina Academy in 1708 (originally located at Schweinfurth), and to a higher grade in 1732, into the Royal Society in 1724, into the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1731, the St. Petersburg Academy in 1735, and the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1754. Among his more celebrated pupils were Antonio Scarpa (who died in 1832, connecting the school of Morgagni with the modern era), Domenico Cotugno (1736‚Äì1822), and Leopoldo Marco Antonio Caldani (1725‚Äì1813), the author of the magnificent atlas of anatomical plates published in 2 volumes at Venice in 1801‚Äì1814. In his earlier years at Padua, Morgagni brought out five more series of the Adversaria anatomica (1717‚Äì1719); these his strictly medical publications were few and casual (on gallstones, varices of the Venae cavae, cases of stone, and several memoranda on medico-legal points, drawn up at the request of the curia). Classical scholarship in those years occupied his pen more than anatomical observation. Late career De sedibus, 1765 It was not until 1761, when he was in his eightieth year, that he brought out the great work which, once for all, made pathological anatomy a science, and diverted the course of medicine into new channels of exactness or precision‚Äîthe De Sedibus et causis morborum per anatomem indagatis \\"Of the seats and causes of diseases investigated through anatomy\\", in five books printed as two folio volumes, which during the succeeding ten years, notwithstanding its bulk, was reprinted several times (thrice in four years) in its original Latin, and was translated into French (1765, republished 1820), English (1769), and German languages (1771). The only special treatise on pathological anatomy previous to that of Morgagni was the work of Th√©ophile Bonet of Neuch√¢tel, Sepulchretum: sive anatomia practica ex cadaveribus morbo denatis, \\"The Cemetery, or, anatomy practiced from corpses dead of disease\\", first published (Geneva, 2 vols. folio) in 1679, three years before Morgagni was born; it was republished at Geneva (3 vols., folio) in 1700, and again at Leiden in 1709. Although the normal anatomy of the body had been comprehensively, and in some parts exhaustively, written by Vesalius and Fallopius, it had not occurred to any one to examine and describe systematically the anatomy of diseased organs and parts. Harvey, a century after Vesalius, poignantly remarks that there is more to be learned from the dissection of one person who had died of tuberculosis or other chronic malady than from the bodies of ten persons who had been hanged. Francis Glisson indeed (1597‚Äì1677) shows in a passage quoted by Bonet in the preface to the Sepulchretum, that he was familiar with the idea, at least, of systematically comparing the state of the organs in a series of bodies, and of noting those conditions which invariably accompanied a given set of symptoms. The work of Bonet was, however, the first attempt at a system of morbid anatomy, and, although it dwelt mostly upon curiosities and monstrosities, it enjoyed much repute in its day; Haller speaks of it as an immortal work, which may in itself serve for a pathological library. Morgagni, in the preface to his own work, discusses the defects and merits of the Sepulchretum: it was largely a compilation of other men's cases, well and ill authenticated; it was prolix, often inaccurate and misleading from ignorance of the normal anatomy, and it was wanting in what would now be called objective impartiality, a quality which was introduced as decisively into morbid anatomy by Morgagni as it had been introduced two centuries earlier into normal human anatomy by Vesalius. Morgagni has narrated the circumstances under which the De Sedibus took origin. Having finished his edition of Valsalva in 1740, he was taking a holiday in the country, spending much of his time in the company, of a young friend who was curious in many branches of knowledge. The conversation turned upon the Sepulchretum of Bonet, and it was suggested to Morgagni by his dilettante friend that he should put on record his own observations. It was agreed that letters on the anatomy of diseased, organs and parts should be written for the perusal of this favoured youth (whose name is not mentioned); and they were continued from time to time until they numbered seventy. Those seventy letters constitute the De sedibus et causis morborum, which was given to the world as a systematic treatise in 2 vols., folio (Venice, 1761), twenty years after the task of epistolary instruction was begun. The letters are arranged in five books, treating of the morbid conditions of the body a capite ad calcem, and together containing the records of some 646 dissections. Some of these are given at great length, and with a precision of statement and exhaustiveness of detail hardly surpassed in the so-called protocols of the German pathological institutes of the present time; others, again, are fragments brought in to elucidate some question that had arisen. The symptoms during the course of the malady and other antecedent circumstances are always prefixed with more or less fullness, and discussed from the point of view of the conditions found after death. Subjects in all ranks of life, including several cardinals, figure in this remarkable gallery of the dead. Many of the cases are taken from Morgagni's early experiences at Bologna, and from the records of his teachers Valsalva and I.F. Albertini (1662‚Äì1738) not elsewhere published. They are selected and arranged with method and purpose, and they are often (and somewhat casually) made the occasion of a long excursus on general pathology and medicine.  Legacy  During his career as a physician he was careful to take extensive notes on many of his consultations. These writings allow the modern reader to observe his practice and description of the body through his own words. We are further able to examine the progress of Morgagni's study of anatomy as it related to his treatment of patients. We are further able to view a particular perspective of a single physician in the context of the 18th century when he lived in order better understand medical practice during this time period. The range of Morgagni's scholarship, as evidenced by his references to early and contemporary literature, was very broad. It has been contended that he was himself not free from prolixity, the besetting sin of the learned; and certainly the form and arrangement of his treatise are such as to make it difficult to use by subsequent practitioners, notwithstanding that it is well indexed in the original edition, in that of Tissot (3 vols., 4to, Yverdon, 1779), and in more recent editions. It differs from modern treatises insofar as the symptoms determine the order and manner of presenting the anatomical facts. His 1769 work described the post mortem findings of air in cerebral circulation and surmised this was the cause of death. Although Morgagni's cases resulted from gas embolism due to damage to the bowel, the same pathology is seen in decompression illness. Although Morgagni was the first to understand and to demonstrate the absolute necessity of basing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment on an exact and comprehensive knowledge of anatomical conditions, he made no attempt (like that of the Vienna school sixty years later) to exalt pathological anatomy into a science disconnected from clinical medicine and remote from practical experience with the scalpel. His precision, his exhaustiveness, and his freedom from bias are his essentially modern or scientific qualities; his scholarship and high consideration for classical and foreign work, his sense of practical ends (or his common sense), and the breadth of his intellectual horizon prove him to have lived before medical science had become largely technical or mechanical. His treatise was the commencement of the era of steady, or cumulative progress in pathology and in practical medicine. From that time on, symptoms ceased to be made up into more or less conventional groups, each of which was a disease; on the other hand, they began to be viewed as the cry of the suffering organs, and it became possible to develop Thomas Sydenham's grand conception of a natural history of disease in a catholic or scientific spirit.

These levels are denoted by multiple touches of price without a breakthrough of the level.  Support versus resistance  A support level is a level where the price tends to find support as it falls. This means that the price is more likely to \\"bounce\\" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level. A resistance level is the opposite of a support level. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to \\"bounce\\" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level.  Reactive versus proactive support and resistance  Proactive support and resistance methods are \\"predictive\\" in that they often outline areas where price has not actually been. They are based upon current price action that, through analysis, has been shown to be predictive of future price action. Proactive support and resistance methods include Measured Moves, Swing Ratio Projection/Confluence (Static (Square of Nine), Dynamic (Fibonacci)), Calculated Pivots, Volatility Based, Trendlines and Moving averages, VWAP, Market Profile (VAH, VAL and POC). Reactive support and resistance are the opposite: they are formed directly as a result of price action or volume behaviour. They include Volume Profile, Price Swing lows/highs, Initial Balance, Open Gaps, certain Candle Patterns (e.g. Engulfing, Tweezers) and OHLC. A price histogram is useful in showing at what price a market has spent more relative time. Psychological levels near round numbers often serve as support and resistance.  Identifying support and resistance levels  Support and resistance levels can be identified by trend lines (technical analysis). Some traders believe in using pivot point calculations. The more often a support/resistance level is \\"tested\\" (touched and bounced off by price), the more significance is given to that specific level. If a price breaks past a support level, that support level often becomes a new resistance level. The opposite is true as well; if price breaks a resistance level, it will often find support at that level in the future. Psychological Support and Resistance levels form an important part of a trader's technical analysis. As price reaches a value ending in 50 (ex. 1.2050) or 00 (ex. 1.3000), people often see these levels as a strong potential for interruption in the current movement. The price may hit the line and reverse, it could hover around the level as Bulls and Bears fought for supremacy, or it may punch straight through. A trader should always exercise caution when approaching 00 levels in general, and 50 levels if it has previously acted as Support or Resistance.  Using support and resistance levels  This is an example of support switching roles with resistance, and vice versa: 500px If a stock price is moving between support and resistance levels, then a basic investment strategy commonly used by traders, is to buy a stock at support and sell at resistance, then short at resistance and cover the short at support as per the following example: 500px When judging entry and exit investment timing using support or resistance levels, it is important to choose a chart based on a price interval period that aligns with your trading strategy timeframe. Short term traders tend to use charts based on interval periods, such as 1 minute (i.e. the price of the security is plotted on the chart every 1 minute). Longer term traders typically use price charts based on hourly, daily, weekly or monthly interval periods. Typically traders use shorter term interval charts when making a final decisions on when to invest, such as the following example based on 1 week of historical data with price plotted every 15 minutes. In this example, the early signs that the stock was coming out of a downtrend was when it started to form support at $30.48 and then started to form higher highs and higher lows. This signals a change from negative to positive trending. 500px See also *Top (technical analysis) *Trend line (technical analysis) *Bottom (technical analysis) *Price discovery *Representativeness heuristic *Fibonacci retracement References External links *John Murphy, Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, *Stephen Petrivy, xBinOp.com (2016).

On 1 February 2004, Faringdon became the first place in south-east England to be awarded Fairtrade Town status. Faringdon Enterprise Gateway helps and advises businesses in rural west Oxfordshire. History The toponym \\"Faringdon\\" means \\"fern covered hill\\". Claims...for example in Goodrich (1928) that King Edward the Elder died there are incorrect.The relevant reference to Fearndune in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is now thought instead to refer to Farndon in Cheshire. The town was granted a weekly market in 1218, and as a result came to be called Chipping Faringdon.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/647; online here; John Terry of Chepyng Farendon, Berks, the defendant; first entry The weekly market is still held today. King John also established an abbey in Faringdon in 1202 (probably on the site of Portwell House), but it soon moved to Beaulieu in Hampshire. In 1417 the aged Archbishop of Dublin, Thomas Cranley, died in Faringdon while journeying to London. Places of interest All Saints' Church All Saints' Parish Church The Church of England parish church of All Saints may date from the 12th century, and the clerestorey and possibly the west end of the nave survive from this period. A Norman doorway survives, although not in its original position, in the baptistery. The chancel and north transept are 13th century and the west chapel is 14th century. The north chapel is a late medieval Perpendicular Gothic addition with 15th century windows. All Saints has a central bell tower, which was reduced in height in 1645 after it was damaged by a cannonball in the English Civil War. Faringdon was fought over because it commands the road to the Radcot Bridge over the River Thames. The tower now has a ring of eight bells. The three oldest bells were cast in 1708. James Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast the tenor bell in 1779 and another bell in 1803. The three youngest bells, including the treble, were cast in 1874 by Mears and Stainbank. Local legend The churchyard is reportedly haunted by the headless ghost of a naval officer, Hampden Pye. According to local legend, Pye was decapitated in a battlefield explosion while fighting in the War of the Spanish Succession after being convinced to enlist by his mother, who sought to separate him from a local girl she considered an unsuitable match. An alternative local legend states that Pye was an unfaithful husband who was decapitated by his wife with a gun. The ghost was reportedly exorcised shortly after Pye's death. Old Town Hall The Old Town Hall (formerly the Market Hall) in the Market Place dates from the late 17th or early 18th century and is a Grade II* listed building. Faringdon Folly Faringdon Folly Just east of the town is Folly Hill or Faringdon Hill, a Greensand outcrop (at grid reference ). In common with Badbury Hill to the west of the town, it has an ancient ditched defensive ring (hill fort). This was fortified by supporters of Matilda sometime during the Anarchy (1135‚Äì1141) ‚Äì her campaign to claim the throne from King Stephen ‚Äì but was soon razed to the ground by Stephen. Oliver Cromwell fortified it in his unsuccessful campaign to defeat the Royalist garrison at Faringdon House. The Pye family had Scots pines planted around the summit, around the time that Faringdon House was rebuilt in the late 18th century. This is a conspicuous and recognisable landmark that can be seen from afar, including from the Vale of White Horse, White Horse Hill, the Berkshire Downs near Lockinge and the Cotswolds to the north. The folly on Folly Hill was designed by Lord Gerald Wellesley, later 7th Duke of Wellington, for Lord Berners and built in 1935. It is high and affords panoramic views of the Vale of White Horse. It once had a sign saying \\"Members of the public committing suicide from this tower do so at their own risk.\\" During the Second World War the Home Guard used it as an observation post. In 1982 Robert Heber-Percy restored it and gave it to the town in trust. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1986. Near the top of London Street near Faringdon Folly is a pub bearing that name. Faringdon House There is a manor house and estate, close to the edge of Faringdon, called Faringdon House. The original house was damaged during the civil war. Its owner at the time, Sir Robert Pye, who was a Royalist, was put under siege by his own son Robert who was a Parliamentarian colonel. Building of the current, smaller, house began about 1780 and was not completed until after 1785. The house was bought in 1787 by William Hallett Esq. It was the home of Lord Berners in the mid-20th century. For a time it was owned by the writer Sofka Zinovieff, the granddaughter of Berners' companion, Robert Heber-Percy, who inherited it on Berners' death in 1950. Geology Numerous borings in a Cretaceous cobble from Faringdon. These are examples of fossil bioerosion. Faringdon is the site of the Faringdon Sponge Gravel Member, part of the Cretaceous Lower Greensand Group. It is rich in fossil sponges, other invertebrates, a few vertebrate bones and teeth, and good examples of bioerosion. Transport Roads The ¬£1.6-million A420 Faringdon Bypass was opened in July 1979. Buses Faringdon is linked with Swindon and Oxford by a frequent service operated seven days a week by Stagecoach in Swindon, and by an hourly service to Wantage, continuing to Didcot and Abingdon, run by Thames Travel and operating on Mondays to Saturdays. Railway A Faringdon branch line was opened in 1864 between Faringdon and the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Uffington, with construction funded by the Faringdon Railway Company (bought outright by the GWR in 1886). Passenger traffic peaked in 1913, but later declined to an extent that the passenger service was withdrawn in 1951. Goods traffic continued until the Beeching closures of 1964. The Faringdon railway station building remains. It currently houses a nursery school. Cultural pursuits Dyed pigeons at Faringdon House Faringdon is notable for the dyed pigeons at Faringdon House. The custom of dyeing pigeons was started by the eccentric Lord Berners. Around the town can be seen some stone plaques with comments such as \\"Please do not throw stones at this notice,\\" reflecting Lord Berners' ongoing influence. Since 2004, Faringdon has held an annual weekend festival known originally as the \\"Faringdon Arts Festival\\", but now as \\"FollyFest\\". It is generally held as a non-profit event on the last summer weekend of the school year. International professional wrestler Mark Haskins, who fights as the \\"Star Attraction\\", was brought up in Faringdon and has family in the town.

He was originally the main character, but was soon overshadowed by his best friend Michael Binkley and later on by Opus the penguin. In Bloom County Milo is the most worldly and cynical of all the characters; he is seemingly the only county resident who cares about politics and goings-on in the world outside his small town. He lives in the Bloom County Boarding House with his grandparents, Major Bloom and Bess Bloom. Said grandparents run the boarding house where most of the characters live. To amuse himself when alone, Milo likes to do things like going spear fishing at a small creek with a whale harpoon. Milo is also a reporter for the Bloom Beacon and later the Bloom Picayune, where he engages in controversial reporting (he says he graduated from the \\"Rupert Murdoch School of Exuberant Journalism\\"). In early strips, he regularly bothers Senator Bedfellow with ridiculous questions, asking for confirming accusations (usually about the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa), and attempting to convict him for virtually anything, although Bedfellow is not his only target. A noteworthy scandal he creates (with some help from Oliver Wendell Jones) involved changing the front page article of the New York Times, from \\"Reagan Calls Women 'America's Most Valuable Resource'\\" to \\"Reagan Calls Women 'America's Little Dumplins'\\", resulting in an attack on the White House by angry feminists but earning praise from Phyllis Schlafly. He has also changed the headline of the Russian newspaper Pravda, intending for it to say \\"Gorbachev urges disarmament: Total! Unilateral!\\". Unfortunately, Oliver gets the translation wrong, resulting in the headline being \\"Gorbachev sings tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!\\" Milo appears to be the only staff reporter on the Bloom Beacon. The only other employees seen are the editor-in-chief and Opus, who serves, at various times, as personals editor, editorial writer, ombudsman, and cartoonist (or, as he styles it, \\"stripper\\"). He also helps create and manage Bill the Cat's band, Deathtongue, and cofounds with Binkley a political party, The Meadow Party, with Bill and Opus on their presidential ticket. Post-Bloom County Milo didn't have an active role in either of Breathed's later syndicated strips. He appeared in Outland only as a background extra on a bus headed far away a week before the feature ended. He appeared in only two frames of the weekly strip Opus, both in the form of visions. The first of these, early on in the strip, was as part of Opus' vision of former \\"Bloom County\\" residents he wished to find - Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Steve Dallas, and Bill the Cat. The latter four would all reunite with Opus during the course of the strip, but not Milo. His other appearance was just prior to the strip's conclusion, as part of Steve Dallas' vision of former Bloom County residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John's wheelchair. Bloom County Revival Milo returned in the first strip of the 2015 revival of Bloom County, informing Opus that he had been \\"asleep\\" for twenty-five years. He continues to play an active role in the comics, though his appearances are relatively minor compared to those of Opus and Bill the Cat. Milo's Uncle Dewey and his niece Baby Boo have appeared in the strip as well.https://www.gocomics.com/bloom-county/2018/07/12 References Bloom, Milo Bloom, Milo Bloom, Milo Bloom, Milo Bloom, Milo ","title":"Milo Bloom"},{"id":"564711","text":"The American Museum of Natural History's south range, by J. Cleaveland Cady, (photo c. 1900‚Äì10) Josiah Cleaveland Cady, commonly known as J. Cleaveland Cady (1837 in Providence, Rhode Island - April 17, 1919 in New York City.New York Times obituary as 'J. Cleveland Cady', 18 April 1919) He was a New York- based architect whose most familiar surviving building is the south range of the American Museum of Natural History on New York's Upper West Side. He worked in partnership from 1870 with Milton See (1854 - October 27, 1920) and from 1873 with Louis DeCoppet Berg (1856-1913) in the firm of Cady, Berg & See. The firm was dissolved in 1909. Cady was the son of Josiah Cady and his wife Lydia, of Providence, Rhode Island, where he was born. He graduated from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, in 1860; the following year he married Emma M. Bulkeley, of Orange, New Jersey; they had five children.Obituary, New York Times. Cady was a devoted Presbyterian, who served as head of the Sunday school at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, East 42nd Street; his first church commission was the First Presbyterian Church of Oyster Bay, New York. Here he utilized the Carpenter Gothic or Stick Style to create a surprising effect for this wood-frame church building set on a hillside overlooking Oyster Bay. Cady, Berg & See The old Metropolitan Opera House in 1905 Cady was the architect of the original Metropolitan Opera House, opened October 1883 (demolished in 1967). Suitable to the Italian opera that was central to the repertory as New Yorkers then conceived it, the new house for the Metropolitan Opera presented a palazzo-like full front on Broadway between 39th and 40th streets that offered three tiers of arched triple openings framed by strong masonry piers. Soon the facade was flanked by matching seven- story towers, to provide extra space and income to support the opera. Cady's original auditorium was gutted by fire on August 27, 1892. The American Museum of Natural History has a magnificently rusticated Richardsonian Romanesque entrance range by Cady, Berg & See, stretching 707 feet along its 77th Street frontage. The Museum also preserves its Cady auditorium, restored in 2002 as the Samuel J. and Ethel LeFrak Theater. Cady and See designed the New York- Presbyterian Hospital, the Skin and Cancer Hospital,Dr. Cady was president of the hospital's board of trustees. Bellevue Medical School, and the Hudson Street Hospital, and also many churches. They designed many college buildings, fifteen buildings for Yale University alone,The Lamson, Fairweather, White, Berkeley and Pearson dormitories, Dwight Hall and the Chittenden Library. and buildings for Williams College, Trinity College in Hartford, ConnecticutTrinity presented him with an honorable L.L.D. in 1905. and for Wesleyan University. Cady served as a trustee for Berea College in Berea, Kentucky, during the tenure of President William Goodell Frost, Cady's nephew. He designed many of the buildings on the Berea College Campus. At Trinity College, Cady's 1878 St. Anthony Hall (Delta Psi)Cady was a member of the fraternity (Obituary). is massively rusticated Richardsonian Romanesque in style, with narrow \\"arrow-slit\\" windows and even a tall cylindrical tower with a steep conical roof. The tower is half-embedded within the densely massed picturesque structure. The Isaac Stern House (mid-block) designed by Cady, Berg & See, with the George J. Gould House on the corner In 1880, Cady, Berg & See were hired by William West Durant to design a summer chapel on an island in Raquette Lake, New York, to entice his wealthy acquaintances to build their summer homes in the area. The chapel was constructed in the Stick Style. The plans were used in 1881, modified by Durant at the request of Harriet Beecher Stowe, for the Church of Our Saviour in Mandarin, Florida, and again in 1883 for the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beattystown, New Jersey. Ten years later Cady again built a chapel on Raquette Lake, St. William's Roman Catholic Church on Long Point, again in Shingle Style, for Durant's employees and local residents. Both churches, only accessible by water, preserve and reflect the Adirondack heritage. Among the firm's New York houses was the Isaac Stern House, 858 Fifth Avenue (demolished). Cady & Gregory In 1909, after Cady, Berg & See was dissolved, Cady and William S. Gregory (a long-term associate) formed a partnership known as \\"Cady & Gregory,\\" with offices at 40 West 32nd Street, New York.Obituary.

Often, the term \\"hybrid dynamical system\\" is used, to distinguish over hybrid systems such as those that combine neural nets and fuzzy logic, or electrical and mechanical drivelines. A hybrid system has the benefit of encompassing a larger class of systems within its structure, allowing for more flexibility in modeling dynamic phenomena. In general, the state of a hybrid system is defined by the values of the continuous variables and a discrete mode. The state changes either continuously, according to a flow condition, or discretely according to a control graph. Continuous flow is permitted as long as so-called invariants hold, while discrete transitions can occur as soon as given jump conditions are satisfied. Discrete transitions may be associated with events. Examples Hybrid systems have been used to model several cyber-physical systems, including physical systems with impact, logic-dynamic controllers, and even Internet congestion. Bouncing ball A canonical example of a hybrid system is the bouncing ball, a physical system with impact. Here, the ball (thought of as a point-mass) is dropped from an initial height and bounces off the ground, dissipating its energy with each bounce. The ball exhibits continuous dynamics between each bounce; however, as the ball impacts the ground, its velocity undergoes a discrete change modeled after an inelastic collision. A mathematical description of the bouncing ball follows. Let x_1 be the height of the ball and x_2 be the velocity of the ball. A hybrid system describing the ball is as follows: When x \\\\in C = \\\\\\\\{x_1 > 0\\\\\\\\}, flow is governed by \\\\dot{x}_1 = x_2, \\\\dot{x}_2 = -g , where g is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations state that when the ball is above ground, it is being drawn to the ground by gravity. When x \\\\in D = \\\\\\\\{x_1 = 0\\\\\\\\}, jumps are governed by x_1^+ = x_1, x_2^+ = -\\\\gamma x_2 , where 0 < \\\\gamma < 1 is a dissipation factor. This is saying that when the height of the ball is zero (it has impacted the ground), its velocity is reversed and decreased by a factor of \\\\gamma. Effectively, this describes the nature of the inelastic collision. The bouncing ball is an especially interesting hybrid system, as it exhibits Zeno behavior. Zeno behavior has a strict mathematical definition, but can be described informally as the system making an infinite number of jumps in a finite amount of time. In this example, each time the ball bounces it loses energy, making the subsequent jumps (impacts with the ground) closer and closer together in time. It is noteworthy that the dynamical model is complete if and only if one adds the contact force between the ground and the ball. Indeed, without forces, one cannot properly define the bouncing ball and the model is, from a mechanical point of view, meaningless. The simplest contact model that represents the interactions between the ball and the ground, is the complementarity relation between the force and the distance (the gap) between the ball and the ground. This is written as 0 \\\\leq \\\\lambda \\\\perp x_1 \\\\geq 0. Such a contact model does not incorporate magnetic forces, nor gluing effects. When the complementarity relations are in, one can continue to integrate the system after the impacts have accumulated and vanished: the equilibrium of the system is well-defined as the static equilibrium of the ball on the ground, under the action of gravity compensated by the contact force \\\\lambda. One also notices from basic convex analysis that the complementarity relation can equivalently be rewritten as the inclusion into a normal cone, so that the bouncing ball dynamics is a differential inclusion into a normal cone to a convex set. See Chapters 1, 2 and 3 in Acary-Brogliato's book cited below (Springer LNACM 35, 2008). See also the other references on non-smooth mechanics.  Hybrid Systems Verification  There are approaches to automatically proving properties of hybrid systems (e.g., some of the tools mentioned below). Common techniques for proving safety of hybrid systems are computation of reachable sets, abstraction refinement, and barrier certificates. Most verification tasks are undecidable,Thomas A. Henzinger, Peter W. Kopke, Anuj Puri, and Pravin Varaiya: What's Decidable about Hybrid Automata, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 1998 making general verification algorithms impossible. Instead, the tools are analyzed for their capabilities on benchmark problems. A possible theoretical characterization of this is algorithms that succeed with hybrid systems verification in all robust casesMartin Fr√§nzle: Analysis of Hybrid Systems: An ounce of realism can save an infinity of states, Springer LNCS 1683 implying that many problems for hybrid systems, while undecidable, are at least quasi-decidable.Stefan Ratschan: Safety verification of non-linear hybrid systems is quasi-decidable, Formal Methods in System Design, volume 44, pp. 71-90, 2014, Other modeling approaches Two basic hybrid system modeling approaches can be classified, an implicit and an explicit one. The explicit approach is often represented by a hybrid automaton, a hybrid program or a hybrid Petri net. The implicit approach is often represented by guarded equations to result in systems of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) where the active equations may change, for example by means of a hybrid bond graph. As a unified simulation approach for hybrid system analysis, there is a method based on DEVS formalism in which integrators for differential equations are quantized into atomic DEVS models. These methods generate traces of system behaviors in discrete event system manner which are different from discrete time systems. Detailed of this approach can be found in references [Kofman2004] [CF2006] [Nutaro2010] and the software tool PowerDEVS.

Lister was connected to a number of well known individuals. He was the nephew of both James Temple, the regicide and also of Sir Matthew Lister, physician to Anne, queen of James I, and to Charles I. He was also the uncle of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough who corresponded with him throughout her life. Lister was educated at Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire under Mr Barwick and matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge in 1658. He graduated in 1658/9, and was elected a fellow in 1660. In 1668 he travelled to France to study as a physician and settled at York in 1670 to practice medicine.Royal Society (Great Britain), Charles Hutton The Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London, Volume 1 He became Fellow of the Royal Society on 2 November 1671. He practised medicine at York until 1683, when he moved to London. In 1684 he received the degree of M.D. at Oxford on the recommendation of the Chancellor. In 1687 became F.R.C.P.. Lister bought Carlton Hall in Craven in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He attended the Earl of Portland when he was ambassador to France in 1698. He was physician to Queen Anne from 1709 until his death. He died at Epsom at the age of 72 and was buried at Clapham Church. Lister was a prolific correspondent. More than 2,000 letters written by and to him survive in the Bodleian Library, Oxford and other repositories. They are to and from a variety of people including family, friends and other scientists. Abstracts of these letters have been published on line.Early Modern Letters Online Memorial inscription The memorial inscription in Clapham church is now lost. It read: Near this place is buried the body of MARTIN LISTER, Doctor of Physick, a Member of the Royal Society, and one of Queen Ann‚Äôs Physicians, who departed this life, the second day of February 1711‚Äì12.Royal College of Physicians Scientific work Lister contributed numerous articles on natural history, medicine and antiquities to the Philosophical Transactions. He was the first arachnologist and conchologist, and provided an unprecedented picture of a seventeenth-century virtuoso. Lister is recognized for his discovery of ballooning spiders and as the father of conchology, but it is less well known that he invented the histogram, provided Newton with alloys, and donated the first significant natural history collections to the Ashmolean Museum. Just as Lister was the first to make a systematic study of spiders and their webs, this biography is the first to analyze the significant webs of knowledge, patronage, and familial and gender relationships that governed his life as a scientist and physician. His principal works were Historiae animalium Angliae tres tractatus (1678) which was the first organised, systematic publication on shells;Historiae Conchyliorum, Vol. 1 and 2 (1685) ‚Äì digital facsimile, Linda Hall Library] Historiae Conchyliorum (1685 1692), and Conchyliorum Bivalvium (1696). As a conchologist he was held in high esteem, but while he recognised the similarity of fossil mollusca to living forms, he regarded them as inorganic imitations produced in the rocks. Lister employed his daughters from an early age. His daughters, Anne Lister, and Susanna Lister were both credited as his illustrators and engravers. In 1683 he communicated to the Royal Society (1684Lister M. An ingenious proposal for a new sort of maps of countries, together with tables of sands and clays, such chiefly as are found in the north parts of England, drawn up about 10 years since, and delivered to the Royal Society Mar. 12. 1683. by the Learned Martin Lister M.D. In Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society . 1684. Vol. 14. P. 739-746.), an ingenious proposal for a new sort of maps of countries; together with tables of sands and clays, such as are chiefly found in the north parts of England. In this essay he suggested the preparation of a soil or mineral map of the country, and thereby is justly credited with being the first to realise the importance of a geological survey. Charles Lyell speaks of Lister in his Principles of Geology as follows: > Dr. Plot, in his 'Natural History of Oxfordshire.' (1677) attributed to a > 'plastic virtue latent in the earth' the origin of fossil shells and fishes; > and Lister, to his accurate account of British shells, in 1678, added the > fossil species, under the appellation of turbinated and bivalve stones. > 'Either,' said he, 'these were terriginous, or if otherwise, the animals > they so exactly represent have become extinct. This writer appears to have > been the first who was aware of the continuity over large districts of the > principal groups of strata in the British series, and who proposed the > construction of regular geological maps.Charles Lyell, Principles of > Geology, 1832, p.35 He was a benefactor of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The ridge Dorsa Lister in the Sea of Serenity on the Moon was named after him.

Earlier years He was born at Corsham, in Wiltshire, the son of a wealthy attorney. He was educated briefly at Westminster School and entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1669 at 15. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1674 and his MA in 1676. He was a tutor at the college for a time, but in 1682 he received his inheritance from his father. He used the money to travel. He went to France, Geneva, and various places in Italy. He stayed for a while in Padua and graduated in medicine at Padua. Blackmore returned to England via Germany and Holland, and then he set up as a physician. In 1685 he married Mary Adams, whose family connections aided him in winning a place in the Royal College of Physicians in 1687. He had trouble with the College, being censured for taking leave without permission, and he strongly opposed the project for setting up a free dispensary for the poor in London. This opposition would be satirised by Sir Samuel Garth in The Dispensary in 1699. Blackmore the epic poet Blackmore had a passion for writing epics. Prince Arthur, an Heroick Poem in X Books appeared in 1695. He supported the Glorious Revolution, and Prince Arthur was a celebration of William III. The poem was based on the form of Virgil's The Aeneid and the subject matter of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. It told of the Celtic King Arthur opposing the invading Saxons and taking London, which was a transparent encoding of William III opposing the \\"Saxon\\" James II and taking London. John Dennis derided the poem as being \\"servile\\" in its treatment of Geoffrey of Monmouth and having an inconsequential and fearful hero. Nevertheless, it went through three editions and William made Blackmore physician-in-ordinary (a position he would hold with Queen Anne as well), gave him a gold medal, and knighted him in 1697. William also assigned Blackmore the task of writing the official treatment of the plot of Sir George Barclay, who sought to kill William (not appearing until 1723, as A true and impartial history of the conspiracy against the person and government of King William III, of glorious memory, in the year 1695). In 1697, Blackmore followed that with King Arthur: an Heroic Poem in Twelve Books. Like its predecessor, it was a treatment of current events in ancient garb, but, this time, the public and court were less interested and the matter less interesting. Additionally, Blackmore took John Milton as his model, rather than Virgil, and he admitted in his preface that his previous book had been too adherent to the Classical unities. Having used his epics to fight political battles, albeit safe ones at first, Blackmore was opposed by wits of the other camp, especially as time went on. William Garth attacked Blackmore's stance on the dispensary, only to be answered by Blackmore with A Satyr against Wit (1700). Tom Brown led a consortium of wits in Commendatory Verses, on the Author of the Two Arthurs, and a Satyr against Wit (1700). Blackmore had not only been explicitly partisan in his epics, but he had announced that epic was necessary to counter the degeneracy of poetry written by wits. Having answered Garth in 1700, he did not answer Brown. However, John Dryden accused Blackmore of plagiarizing the idea of an epic on Arthur from him and called him a \\"Pedant, Canting Preacher, and a Quack\\" whose poetry had the rhythm of wagon wheels because Blackmore wrote in hackney cabs on his way between patients (prologue to The Pilgrim (1700)). In 1705, with Anne on the throne and William dead, Blackmore wrote another epic, Eliza: an Epic Poem in Ten Books, on the plot by Rodrigo Lopez, the Portuguese physician, against Queen Elizabeth. Once more, the \\"epic\\" was current events, as it meant to denounce John Radcliffe, a Jacobite physician who was out of favor with Anne. Anne did not appear to take sufficient notice of the epic, but Sarah Churchill did. Two occasional pieces followed: An advice to the poets: a poem occasioned by the wonderful success of her majesty's arms, under the conduct of the duke of Marlborough in Flanders (1706) and Instructions to Vander Beck (1709). These courted favor with the Duke of Marlborough with some success. In 1711, Blackmore produced The Nature of Man, a physiological/theological poem on climate and character (with the English climate being the best). This was a tune up for Creation: A Philosophical Poem in 1712, which was praised by John Dennis, Joseph Addison, and, later, Samuel Johnson, for its Miltonic tone. It ran to 16 editions, and of all his epics it was best received. Its design was to refute the atheism of Vanini, Hobbes and (supposedly) Spinoza, and to unfold the intellectual philosophy of Locke. Johnson thought that it would be the sole memory of Blackmore, and Dennis said that it was the English De Rerum Natura, but with infinitely better reasoning. Blackmore ceased writing epics for a time after Creation. In 1722 he continued his religious themes with Redemption, an epic on the divinity of Jesus Christ designed to oppose and confute the Arians (as he called the Unitarians). The next year, he released another long epic, Alfred. The poem was ostensibly about King Alfred the Great, but like his earlier Arthurian epics, this one was political. It was dedicated to Prince Frederick, the eldest son of King George II, but the poem vanished without causing any comment from court or town. While others approached the epic as a celebration of national origins (Dryden, for example) or sought in it the most lofty subject matter possible (as Edmund Spenser and John Milton had done), Blackmore argued that the form of the epic would \\"reform\\" poetry, that it would cease the cavils of wits and the sexuality of rakes. Further, while proclaiming his intention of reforming poetry itself, he used his epics quite often to achieve political, and personal, goals. Non- epic writing Blackmore was a religious author when he was not a political author. In 1713 he and his friend John Hughes began a periodical modelled on The Spectator entitled The Lay Monk. It only ran from 13 November 1713 to 15 February 1714 and appeared once every three weeks during that period. All the same, Blackmore had its issues collected and published as The Lay Monastery in the year the journal foundered. In 1716, he became censor as well as a director of the College of Physicians, but the Hanoverians were not as taken with Blackmore as William or Anne had been. In that year, he had two volumes of Essays upon Several Subjects published, with an attack on Alexander Pope in the second volume. In 1718, he again went to press with A Collection of Poems on Various Subjects, which collected shorter poems that had already been published. Blackmore was very concerned with Protestantism. He joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in America in 1704. He wrote Just Prejudices against the Arian Hypothesis, putatively against Deism and Unitarianism in 1721 and then, to help matters, wrote Modern Arians Unmasked in the same year. He also produced A New Version of the Psalms of David in 1721 and tried to get the Church of England to accept them as canonical translations. The next year, he resigned his governing position in the College of Physicians, and he also continued his campaign against supposed Arians with Redemption. In 1724, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was set to publish Blackmore's Psalms as official for America, but the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson (a conservative, but a Whig), opposed the project and kept it from coming to fruition. Finally, Blackmore attempted to answer Deism again with Natural Theology, or, Moral Duties Consider'd apart from Positive in 1728. In 1731, his last work, The Accomplished Preacher, was published posthumously. As a physician Blackmore has come down, largely through the verse of Alexander Pope, as one avatar of Dulness, but, as a physician, he was quite forward thinking. He agreed with Sir Thomas Sydenham that observation and the physician's experience should take precedence over any Aristotelian ideals or hypothetical laws. He rejected Galen's humour theory as well. He wrote on plague in 1720, smallpox in 1722, and consumption in 1727. He died in Boxted, Essex and was buried in his local parish church, where a monument was constructed. The grave of Richard Blackmore in the sanctuary of St Peter's Church, Boxted, Essex. A memorial to Richard Blackmore in the chancel of St Peter's Church, Boxted, Essex. As a butt of satire Blackmore's fame today rests with his enemies. Garth's The Dispensary made him out to be a greedy fool with delusions, but Pope's criticisms would be the most lasting, and Pope hits Blackmore over and over again on his stupidity and delusions of grandeur. The Scriblerus Club (Pope, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Henry St. John, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas Parnell) attacked Blackmore in 1717's Three Hours after Marriage. Pope further picked out Blackmore's foolish lines in Peri Bathos (1727) and gives a devastating characterization of \\"Neverending Blackmore\\" in The Dunciad (1728), where Blackmore's poetry is so awful that it can even put lawyers to sleep. These attacks were on top of Tom Brown's previous attacks, as well as Dryden's. Blackmore's poetry is leaden. However, his special marks as a \\"dunce\\" come from his willingness to use poetry, and particularly the epic, for contemporary political purposes. The self-interest involved in King Arthur was apparent to contemporaries, and the desperation of Alfred was similarly offensive to other poets. However, Blackmore used his poetry to satirise and destroy persons of the other political factions, and that made him (except for when his subject matter was religion) fair game for a counter-attack that he could not survive. Nevertheless, in his own time, he appears to have enjoyed somewhat of a following, as evidenced by the frequency with which his poems were quoted in his contemporary Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible.

History Residential building cluster in Midwood The name, Midwood, derives from the Middle Dutch word, Midwout (middle woods; Modern Dutch: Midwoud), the name the settlers of New Netherland called the area of dense woodland midway between the towns of Boswyck (Bushwick) and Breuckelen (Brooklyn). Jan Snedeker, Jan Stryker, and Tomys Swartwout solicited from Director-General Stuyvesant the right of settling together on a level area of wilderness (vlacke bosch, the flat bush), adjacent to the outlying farms at Breukelen and Nieuw Amersfoort. Through Swartwout's suggestion, the settlement was named the village of Midwout or Midwolde. In April 1655, Stuyvesant and the Council of New Netherland appointed Swartwout a schepen (magistrate), to serve with Snedeker and Adriaen Hegeman as the Court of Midwout.http://memory.loc.gov/master/gdc/scdser01/200401/books_on_film_project/loc06/nov13batchofPDFs/20060523002sw.pdf Later, it became part of old Flatbush, situated between the towns of Gravesend and Flatlands.BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOODS.. Present & Past, accessed December 21, 2006 Settlement was begun by the Dutch in 1652; they later gave way to the English, who conquered it in 1664, but the area remained rural and undeveloped for the most part until its annexation to the City of Brooklyn in the 1890s. It became more developed in the 1920s when large middle class housing tracts and apartment buildings were built.\\"FISKE TERRACE-MIDWOOD PARK HISTORIC DISTRICT.\\" Historic Districts Council. Accessed March 21, 2015 Many Midwood residents moved to the suburbs in the 1970s, and the neighborhood and its commercial districts declined. Drawn by its quiet middle-class ambiance, new residents began pouring into Midwood during the 1980s; many of them were recently landed immigrants from all over the world. The largest group were from the Soviet Union, but substantial numbers also arrived from Jamaica, Haiti, Guyana, Mexico and elsewhere in South America; from Ireland, Italy, Poland, the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), and elsewhere in eastern Europe; and from Greece, Turkey, Israel, Syria, the Persian Gulf states, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, China, and Korea. In a short time, Midwood was transformed, from a predominantly Jewish neighborhood with a smattering of Irish-Americans and German-Americans, to a remarkably polyglot section of the borough of Brooklyn. Many residents refer to Midwood as \\"Flatbush,\\" or, erroneously, as being \\"part of Flatbush\\", an older and more established neighborhood and former township, which in the 19th century included modern Midwood. The usage of Flatbush to mean Midwood dates to the period when the neighborhood was first formed, and known as South Greenfield. Many also consider the nearby neighborhood of Fiske Terrace/Midwood Gardens to be part of Midwood, but, as in many cities, neighborhood boundaries in Brooklyn are somewhat fluid and poorly defined. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Midwood was 52,835, a decrease of 2,605 (4.7%) from the 55,440 counted in 2000.

The entirety of Community Board 14, which comprises Flatbush and Midwood, had 165,543 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.4 years. This is slightly higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 25% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 29% between 25‚Äì44, and 24% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively. As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 14 was $56,599. In 2018, an estimated 22% of Flatbush and Midwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flatbush and Midwood, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Flatbush and Midwood are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. Character Shopping The main shopping streets in the area are Kings Highway, Avenue J, Avenue M, Flatbush Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and Coney Island Avenue. Kings Highway A Midwood shopping street at night Kingsway Theatre circa 1977 Dubrow's Cafeteria In the 1950s through the 1970s, Kings Highway had Dubrow's Cafeteria, a classic cafeteria where holes would be punched in patrons' printed tickets, which would total the cost of the meal. It was a popular place to eat and socialize. In his run for the White House, Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy held a massive campaign rally just outside Dubrow's Cafeteria. A huge crowd of people turned out to hear this popular political icon speak, stretching for blocks in all directions. Years later, his brother Senator Robert F. Kennedy (\\"Bobby\\") held a similar campaign rally there for his run for President, with a similarly large audience. The community has long been known as a Democratic stronghold. Additionally, \\"Levine's\\" was the king of the bar mitzvah suit trade, and \\"Jimmy's\\" catered to high fashion customers. Kings Highway was home to the now famed Crazy Eddie Electronics Empire. The first Original Crazy Eddie store was located on Kings Hwy., then moved to larger quarters just south of Kings Highway on Coney Island Avenue. There were four movie theaters on Kings Highway: the \\"Kingsway\\", the \\"Jewel\\", the \\"Avalon\\" (which closed in 1982) and the \\"Triangle\\" theatre, located on Quentin road, across from Sgt. Joyce Kilmer Triangle. Visitors to Kings Highway are amused by the colored holiday-style lights that are strung across above the street and feature a lighted gold \\"Kings Crown\\" at a few intersections. In the fall of 2008, the NYCDOT planned to implement an experimental congestion parking plan in the Kings Highway Business District, which would have raised parking meter rates from 75 cents to as much as $2.50 an hour. Specific streets were not then designated. Kings Highway is currently anchored by several chain stores, such as Rite-Aid and TJ Maxx, and multiple ethnic food stores. Unique businesses include the ornate Amazon Caffe (kosher dairy), Kings Games (the largest gaming center in New York City), several high fashion outlets, jewelry stores, and sushi restaurants. Nostrand Avenue Nostrand Avenue was known for fashionable boutiques such as \\"Edna Nelkin's Jewelry,\\" America's finest children's wear boutique, \\"Greenstone's\\" (now located on both Columbus and Madison Avenues in Manhattan), \\"Burton's\\", \\"Shirtland\\", and \\"The Shoe Box\\". As retailers retired, the street changed and became known for its automobile showrooms, including Plaza Honda. A U.S. Postal Service facility (Zip Code 11210) can be found on Nostrand Avenue between Avenues I and J. Lettered avenues Avenue M, one of the major business streets of Midwood, is a central location for kosher food and butchers. While in the past it was home to Cookie's, one of Brooklyn's best known restaurants and hang-outs (also popular with the NBC studio staff), today there are no fewer than 10 kosher restaurants and 3 kosher bakeries. From the 1920s through the 1940s, the \\"Dorman Square Restaurant\\" was popular with the Vitagraph studios employees, as well as playing a role in a Vitagraph film or two. One of Brooklyn's most legendary Italian restaurants, \\"Restaurant Bonaparte\\", also catered to the actors and actresses working on Avenue M in the NBC studios at that time. Restaurant Bonaparte was known for its \\"Three Musketeers\\". It also had a wishing well fountain in its lobby entrance, filled with customers' coins. The Avenue has an elevated subway station. Until the 1970s, Avenue M had its own movie theater, The Century \\"Elm\\" (later an Emigrant Savings Bank branch, now a branch of Apple Bank for Savings). Near the end of June each year, the Midwood Development Corporation hosts the popular Midwood Mardi Gras Street Fair along the Avenue, from East 12th Street to Ocean Avenue. Shoppers can find a municipal muni-meter parking lot on East 17th Street at Chestnut Avenue just north of Avenue M. Many of the retail businesses are closed on the Jewish Sabbath and High Holy Days. Avenue J is another major business street in Midwood, with many kosher restaurants, deli, pizzerias, and butchers. Coney Island Avenue On Coney Island Avenue in Midwood, primarily between Avenue H and Avenue P, are the U.S. Postal Service Midwood station (Zip Code 11230), The \\"Kent Triplex Movie Theater\\", and other assorted retailers.

Judaism In the 1980s and 1990s, a wave of Orthodox Jews moved into the area from Borough Park, attracted by Midwood's large homes and tree- lined streets. Today, in addition to Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews, the area is home to a burgeoning Sephardic population. Along Kings Highway from Coney Island to McDonald Avenues are many Middle Eastern restaurants and take-out food shops. The East Midwood Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue, was founded in 1924. The building, located on Ocean Avenue, is a 1929 Renaissance revival structure with a capacity of 950 in the main sanctuary. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.\\"National Register of Historic Places Continuation Sheet (NPS Form 10-900-a)\\", OMB No. 1024-0018, Section 7, p. 1.\\"National Register of Historic Places Listings\\", June 16, 2006. Retrieved July 7, 2008. The Kingsway Jewish Center is an historic synagogue from the 1950s on Nostrand Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

The Midwood branch is located at 975 East 16th Street near Avenue J. It was founded in 1912 and relocated several times before moving to its current location. The branch was rebuilt in the 1950s and again in 1998, and a public plaza was built in 2013. The Kings Highway branch is located at 2115 Ocean Avenue near Kings Highway. It was founded in 1910 and initially occupied several storefronts. When the Kings Highway branch moved to its current location in 1954, it became the first BPL branch library to be built by the New York City government. The library was renovated in 2009 and now contains a reading room in the basement and a passport office. Transportation The area is served by the New York City Subway's BMT Brighton Line (), IND Culver Line (), and the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line ().

In popular culture Film Midwood has long played a part in both film and television production. The film industry established itself in the neighborhood in 1907, when the Vitagraph company occupied studios at 1277 East 14th near Avenue M. Scenes from films like \\"Hey Pop\\" and \\"Buzzin' Around,\\" starring Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, were filmed on streets in Midwood.Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn: Avenue M ‚Äì Movie Capital of the World?, accessed December 21, 2006. Warner Bros. purchased the studio in the 1920s, using it for short subjects, and moved the studio operation to Hollywood in 1939. A large smokestack bearing the name Vitagraph is still on the property, visible from the BMT Brighton Line. Many Vitagraph employees resided within the community. The Brooklyn Historical Society and the Museum of the Moving Image (Astoria, New York) have collections on The Vitagraph Studios. An old vintage aerial photograph of the Vitagraph complex (and its streets) hangs today on a wall in the offices of the Midwood Development Corporation. The Vitagraph Studios were later featured in a New York Times Article (2007), and in the PBS, WNET-13 TV Special 'A Walk Through Brooklyn,' hosted by David Hartman and historian Barry Lewis. Old historic photographs of the studio show that part of it also existed across the Brighton line subway tracks where Edward R. Murrow High School now stands. After Warner Bros. vacated the land (in the late 1960s-early 1970s), Yeshiva University purchased it for Brooklyn Torah Academy, the Brooklyn branch of their high school. The Shulamith School purchased the property some years later, when it merged BTA into Manhattan Torah Academy. Until 2015 the building was home to the Shulamith Yeshiva School for Girls, which moved to Manhattan Beach. Present day, many within the community were unaware that the Shulamith School buildings and property were once a film studio. In 2018, the yeshiva was replaced with an eight-story, 302-unit apartment building. \\"The Leading Male\\" men's attire store, once located at the corner of Kings Highway and East 12th Street, was the source for the disco attire that John Travolta and the other male cast members wore in the film Saturday Night Fever. A duplicate of the white suit Travolta wore in the film was at that time displayed in one of the showcase windows. Television NBC Studios In 1952, NBC Television purchased part of the Vitagraph Studios, which then became known as NBC Brooklyn. Studio 1 along Locust Avenue. A new larger studio known as Color Studio 2 at 1268 East 14th Street, on the northwest corner of its intersection with Avenue M. Programs including The Perry Como Variety Show, TV's adaptation of Broadway's Peter Pan with Mary Martin, The Sammy Davis, Jr. Variety Show, the nighttime version of the quiz show Tic Tac Dough, Sing Along With Mitch Miller (And His \\"Sing-Along Gang\\") (1961‚Äì64) which featured a then-young singer named Leslie Uggams, who years later became best known for her role in the historic TV epic Roots, were all taped there for later broadcast. Old NBC press releases show that two of the earliest shows to emanate from there (both then considered early NBC \\"Big Specials\\") were The Esther Williams Aqua Special (October 29, 1956), and Satins & Spurs (10/12/1954). The same Brooklyn studios were used in more recent decades to broadcast the soap opera Another World (1964‚Äì99), Another World \\"spin-off\\" soap drama Somerset (1971‚Äì76), the situation comedy The Cosby Show, and three 1975 episodes of Saturday Night Live. There was also an NBC News NASA Apollo Space Mission Special taped here, a short-lived mystery detective drama, and a weekly circus variety show (the later two for another network). Bill Cosby and crew after a period of time relocated the show to their new home at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens. The \\"second\\" NBC Cosby Show that followed (co-starring Madeline Kahn, most notably of Mel Brooks hit comedy films Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) was also taped at Kaufman Astoria Studios. In 1965‚Äì66, the studios were also home to Hullabaloo, a popular weekly NBC prime-time musical variety series, produced by Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion (Smith being best known for producing Barbra Streisand TV specials). Hullabaloo first aired on NBC on the evening of December 1, 1965, and its final episode was aired on 4/11/66. The program featured bands at the top of the music charts, singers and other celebrity entertainers of the period such as Sonny & Cher and Tina Sinatra, and many performers from the so- called British Invasion, like The Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, The Dave Clark Five, Petula Clark, Marianne Faithfull, The Moody Blues, and Donovan. It first originated from the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and its premiere was hosted by Jack Jones. After a brief period of time the program was moved east to NBC Color Studio 2 in Midwood. During its New York heyday a few episodes were also recorded at NBC's headquarters studios in Rockefeller Center. Brian Epstein, manager of The Beatles, also hosted a Hullabaloo program from London. Neither The Beatles nor Elvis Presley were ever a guest or host of the aforementioned variety shows, however. The Sammy Davis, Jr. show was taped in the much smaller Studio 1 along Locust Ave. The audience entrance was on the northernmost part of East 13th, opposite the outdoor scenic storage yard. In the early 1970s the NBC TV variety show Kraft Music Hall was taped in Studio 2. Ed McMahon, country music star Eddy Arnold, and John Davidson were frequent hosts. Guests included Johnny Cash, Simon & Garfunkel, Woody Allen, Wayne Newton, Bill Dana, Alan King, Bobby Darin, Dionne Warwick, her sister Dee Dee Warwick, Mitzi Gaynor, Roy Rogers and his wife Dale Evans, and many others. Desi Arnaz hosted one episode. His ex-wife actress/TV icon comedian Lucille Ball and her kids specifically flew in from Hollywood to cheer him on, on this his return to TV. One memorable episode of the Kraft Music Hall program was hosted by comedian Don Rickles, which featured him walking off a Coney Island‚Äìbound Brighton Line subway train at the Avenue M station, then speaking about old Brooklyn memories, old childhood street games of the past while walking the avenue, then playing a game of \\"Kick-the-Can\\" and New York-style stickball, all actually taped on location on East 15th Street between Avenue M and the old Vitagraph Studios building at Chestnut Avenue. Many of the noted variety shows (with the exception of Mitch Miller) had a live studio audience for both rehearsals and/or actual show recording. Often NBC Guest Relations staff could be found standing on the street outside the studio offering free tickets to the dress rehearsals and/or the actual taping of those 1960s programs, and sometimes even The Cosby Show. The only exception to that was the brief Saturday Night Live stint at the studio (which was pre-filled to capacity) as well as \\"big name\\" guest or host show tapings (e.g. The Rolling Stones or Desi Arnaz, especially with the presence of Lucille Ball at the studio to cheer on Arnaz). NBC Guest Relations operated a charter bus to/from their Rockefeller Center headquarters to the Brooklyn studio for pre-ticketed 1960s audience members, so that they did not have to travel by car or subway. They also did so for The Cosby Show. Fans in the know could always be found outside the studio entrance waiting to greet their favorite celebrity, many of whom in turn were happy to stop and chat, sign an autograph, pose for a photo, all without the hassle of present-day out-of-control paparazzi. From the 1950s through the original Cosby Show years, the NBC Brooklyn studio presence in Midwood basically transformed the community's Avenue M into Brooklyn's own versions of Broadway and Hollywood. Fond memories of the great many \\"A-List\\" celebrities that had performed inside the former NBC Studios and walked the local streets still exist today. Now, many within the community, and visitors alike, do not even know that a television production studio exists at the location, nor that the adjacent present-day Shulamith School property was once an early major silent film studio. A few old classic episodes of Perry Como, Hullabaloo, and Kraft Music Hall (taped at the studio) can be found on VHS and DVD, as well as on YouTube. The Museum of Television and Radio (New York and Los Angeles) has a collection on the noted television programs. NBC sold the studio in 2000. The facility became JC Studios. The CBS soap opera As the World Turns was taped here from January 2000 until June 2010. The series was cancelled after 54 years. The final episode aired on September 17, 2010.\\"As The World Turns to leave Brooklyn\\", New York Post, December 11, 2009.

Two very large and visible NBC 'N' logo signs were placed on the East 13th and 14th Street upper parts of the tall red brick Studio 2 building on Avenue M until The Cosby Show years. To the dismay of many remaining long-time residents, both were taken down when NBC vacated the premises, prior to the studios being sold to JC Studios. In 2014, JC Studios closed. In 2015, OHEL Children's Home and Family Services created offices in the former Studio 1 on Locust Avenue, part of the original Vitagraph Studios. Studio 2, built by NBC, will become a self-storage facility.

Life He was born in the parish of St Andrew Holborn, London, in 1658. He was educated at Harrow School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. degree in 1679. In the next year he was fined and dismissed from his college for having wounded a fellow student with a sword. He was, however, received at Trinity Hall, where he took his M.A. degree in 1683. After travelling in France and Italy, he settled in London, where he became acquainted with Dryden, and close to Wycherley, Congreve and the leading literary figures of his day; and being made temporarily independent by inheriting a small fortune, he devoted himself to literature. The Duke of Marlborough procured him a place as one of the queen's waiters in the customs with a salary of ¬£20 a year. This he afterwards disposed of for a small sum, retaining, at the suggestion of Lord Halifax, a yearly charge upon it for a long term of years. In the years prior to 1704 he reigned as one of the leading coffee house wits alongside Congreve. One of his tragedies, a violent attack on the French in harmony with popular prejudice, entitled Liberty Asserted, was produced with great success at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1704. For Appius and Virginia (1709), he invented a new kind of thunder. The play was not a success and the management of the Drury Lane Theatre withdrew it. But later at a performance of Macbeth there Dennis found the thunder produced by his method and said, : That is my thunder, by God; the villains will play my thunder, but not my play. According to Brewer's entry (under the headword thunder), this is the origin of the phrase, \\"to steal one's thunder\\". Dennis is best remembered as the leading critic of his generation, and as a pioneer of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality. After taking the Grand Tour of the Alps he published his comments in a journal letter published as Miscellanies in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a \\"delight that is consistent with reason\\", the experience of the journey was at once a \\"pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear\\", but \\"mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair.\\" The significance of his account is that the concept of the sublime, at the time a rhetoric term primarily relevant to literary criticism, was used to describe a positive appreciation for horror and terror in aesthetic experience, in contrast to Ashley Cooper, The Third Earl of Shaftesbury's more timid response to the sublime. Dennis appears to have reached a turning point in 1704, when, at the age of 47 he withdrew from city life. In the years following this he appears to have become increasingly marginalised, both from new developments in cultural life, and from a new generation on the literary scene. His Essay on Italian Opera in 1706 argues that the introspection encouraged by the sensuality of music, but particularly Italian opera, is harmful to public spirit at a time of war. In 1711 he fell out with both Joseph Addison and Alexander Pope. Dr. Johnson regarded Pope as the instigator of the latter dispute, his Essay on Criticism published mid-May 1711, having \\"attacked [Dennis, characterised as Appius] wantonly\\", and provoking Dennis' Reflections Critical and Satirical upon a late Rhapsody Called, an Essay upon Criticism, the following month. Dennis' forensic skills as a critic enabled him to critique the flaws in the far younger poet's observations, intended to show \\"that as there is a great deal of venom in this little gentleman‚Äôs temper, nature has very wisely corrected it with a great deal of dullness‚Ä¶as there is no creature in nature so venomous, there is nothing so stupid and so impotent as a hunch-back‚Äôd toad; and a man must be very quiet and very passive, and stand still to let him fasten his teeth and his claws, or to be supriz‚Äôd sleeping by him, before that animal can have any power to hurt him.\\" Lacerating pamphlets followed on both sides, culminating in Pope's Dunciad, and in a scathing note in the edition of 1729 (Book I, 1, 106), which included an insulting epigram attributed to Richard Savage, but now generally ascribed to Pope himself. Dennis had fallen out with Addison in April 1711, over an essay that contained a good-humoured rejection of the notion of poetic justice in The Spectator, No. 40. His analysis of Addison's highly successful patriotic tragedy in the Remarks upon Cato (1713) returned to this subject, and while Dennis' motivation may have been partly personally motivated, his criticism remains acute and sensible, and is quoted at considerable length by Johnson in his Life of Addison. According to Thomas Macaulay (Life and Writings of Addison, p. 215) Pope seized the opportunity to respond on Addison's behalf \\"venting his malice under the show of friendship\\", with The Narrative of Dr. Robert Norris, concerning the strange and deplorable frenzy of John Dennis ... (1713). The pamphlet was full of personal abuse, exposing Dennis's foibles, but offered no defence of Cato, and Addison repudiated any connivance in this attack, and indirectly notified Dennis that when he did answer his objections, it would be without personalities. However, Dennis's day as a leading figure on the London literary scene was over. He gained the nickname of \\"Furius\\", while his enthusiasm for the terrible sublime was mocked. The apocryphal tale regarding his petitioning the Duke of Marlborough to have a special clause inserted in the Treaty of Utrecht to secure him from French vengeance, if true, suggests growing paranoia. (Marlborough joked that although he had been a still greater enemy of the French nation, he had no fear for his own security!) Dennis outlived his annuity from the customs, and his last years were spent in great poverty. Bishop Atterbury sent him money, and he received a small sum annually from Sir Robert Walpole. A benefit performance was organized at the Haymarket (18 December 1733) on his behalf, for which Pope wrote an ill-natured prologue, which the actor and sentimental playwright Colley Cibber (another victim of Pope's invective) recited. Dennis died within three weeks of this performance, on 6 January 1734. Dennis' works were published in 1702, Select Works (2 vol.) in 1718, and Miscellaneous Tracts, the first volume only of which appeared, in 1727. Although Johnson was to call for a complete edition of Dennis' works, this was not undertaken until 1938 (Edward Niles Hooker, The Critical Works of John Dennis (Baltimore, 1939).

At the end of his life, he was probably best known for the BBC Radio 2 \\"oldies\\" shows A Square Deal and Thanks for the Memory. He was also a novelist, a theatre director and a hit songwriter. Biography He was born in Islington, London, and attended St Dunstan's College and the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art. Gregg worked as an announcer for the BBC Empire Service in 1934 and 1935, while intermittently performing in repertory theatre. He appeared on Broadway in Terence Rattigan's comedy French Without Tears, from 28 September 1937 to January 1938. In the Second World War, he first served as a private with the Lincolnshire Regiment in 1939, before becoming an officer in the 60th Rifles the following year. Gregg spoke German fluently, and worked for the BBC German service, to such good effect that Goebbels assumed he must be a German traitor. He was invalided out in 1943. Among his \\"more than 200 songs\\" he wrote was the wartime hit \\"I'm Going To Get Lit Up When The Lights Go up in London\\", written in 1940 and sung by his first wife, Zoe Gail, in George Black's 1943 production Strike a New Note. It was broadcast in 1944 to alert the Resistance that the invasion of Europe was imminent. On seeing German V1s flying over London, Gregg composed his best-known song, \\"Maybe It's Because I'm A Londoner,\\" in 20 minutes while on leave in 1944; it became a hit and London folk anthem in 1947. He also composed numbers for the musicals The Love Racket (1943), Sweet And Low (1944) and Strike It Again (1945). After the war, in 1949, he co-starred with Anne Crawford, in 'Western Wind', at the Manchester Opera House, and also directed Agatha Christie stage plays, including The Hollow (1951) and The Mousetrap (for seven years, beginning in 1953). The period was the subject of his 1980 memoir, Agatha Christie and All That Mousetrap. He called Christie \\"a mean old bitch\\". He presented and performed in numerous radio programmes, including A Square Deal for seven years and Thanks for the Memory for over 30. He also acted in films and on television and wrote light comedies and two novels. He was married three times: his first wife was the musical comedy star Zoe Gail (married 1943, divorced 1950), with whom he had a daughter, actress-writer Stacey Gregg; his second wife was the actress and singer Pat Kirkwood (married 1956, divorced 1979), with whom he starred in the 1958 musical comedy Chrysanthemum; and finally, in 1980, he married Carmel Lytton, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

He is considered one of the most important and popular \\"Founders of Modern Bulgaria\\", and is sometimes referred to as \\"the Bulgarian Bismarck\\". In 1875 and 1876 he took part in the preparation for the Stara Zagora uprising, as well as the April Uprising. Stambolov was, after Stanko Todorov and Todor Zhivkov, one of the country's longest-serving prime ministers. Criticised for his dictatorial methods, he was among the initiators of economic and cultural progress in Bulgaria during the time of the Balkan Wars.  Early years  A statue of Stefan N. Stambolov in his birthplace Veliko TurnovoStambolov was born in Veliko Tarnovo. His father took part in the \\"Velchova Zavera\\" plot against Turkish rule in 1835. Stambolov grew up around prominent revolutionists like Hristo Ivanov, the priest Matey Preobrazhenski, and Hristo Karaminkov. He began his education in his home town, but later (1870‚Äì1872) studied at the Seminary in Odessa. In 1878 he was for a short period of time a teacher in his home town, and later he went to Romania. He joined the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC). After the death of BRCC founder Vassil Levski, Stambolov was chosen as his successor. He was the leader of the unsuccessful uprising in Stara Zagora in 1875 and of the Turnovo revolutionary committee in the great uprising of April 1876.  Political career  Stambolov was involved in political discussions as early as the time of the first Bulgarian parliament: the \\"Founding Assembly\\" of 1879. After 1880 he became the vice-chairman and later the chairman of the Narodno Subranie (the Bulgarian parliament). In 1885, he helped bring about the union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On , officers aligned with Russia overthrew Prince Alexander in a coup d'√©tat. Stambolov led a counter-coup on 28 August which removed the Russian-controlled provisional government, and he assumed the position of regent. Russian hostility, however, barred the restoration of Alexander, who abdicated on 8 September.  Regency  At the age of 32, Stambolov found himself in the highly unusual position of being simultaneously a government minister, president, and regent for an absent monarch. Stambolov's style of governing during his regency was observed as being increasingly authoritarian. But this was, to some extent, a reaction to the grave difficulties arising from his peculiar position. Indeed, the regency has been described as marking the beginning of the tragic years of Stambolov's life. According to a close friend, Stambolov was \\"almost inclined to resign the honours [of serving as regent], together with the dangers of his position, and retire to his beloved Turnovo.\\" But he stayed on, recognizing that there was no other suitable candidate, and that if he did not lead, then Bulgaria's sovereignty would likely be lost. Through Stambolov's efforts, a successor to Alexander was found in Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was proclaimed Knyaz (\\"Ruling Prince\\") of autonomous Bulgaria on 7 July 1887 and crowned on 14 August 1887. However, it is known that Stambolov initially supported Carol I of Romania and that he intended to establish a union with the country. Russian opposition forced Carol I to reject the offer. Stambolov also requested to the Ottoman Empire a dual Bulgarian-Turkish state. Prime minister With Ferdinand's accession to the throne, Stambolov retired as regent, and became Prime Minister. He served for seven years (1887‚Äì1894). Stambolov was a nationalist; as a politician, he strengthened the country's diplomacy, its economy, and the general political power of the state. He confronted Knyaz Ferdinand, and blocked his schemes to usurp additional authority. This caused him a lot of stress, and he became distant from his friends, and suspicious of all around him. The public came to dislike him, as he took increasingly drastic measures against his enemies. He survived an assassination attempt unharmed, but responded by having many people he suspected of taking part imprisoned and treated brutally. Lavov most was built while Stambolov was prime minister. By 1894 the prolonged stress from all sides had taken its toll, and Stambolov resigned, which was happily accepted by Ferdinand.  Death  On 15 July 1895, Stambolov took a carriage to his home, along with his bodyguard and a friend. Midway, the carriage was stopped by an assassin who fired his revolver, thus startling the horses. Stambolov quickly exited, but was met by three more assassins, armed with knives. Stambolov, who carried a revolver, shot one of the attackers. The others wrestled him to the ground. They knew that Stambolov wore an armoured vest, so they stabbed at his head, which he tried to protect with his hands. His bodyguard finally chased away the assailants. Stambolov was hurried to his home with a fractured skull and mutilated hands. He is supposed to have said on his deathbed, \\"Bulgaria's people will forgive me everything. But they will not forgive that it was I who brought Ferdinand here.\\" It is believed that Stambolov was well-aware that his days after his resignation were numbered, and that Ferdinand was likely to be the one who would orchestrate an assassination. He died at about 2.00 a.m. on 18 July.  Assessment  Stambolov believed that the liberation of Bulgaria was an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was characterized by the goal of preserving Bulgarian independence at all costs. During his leadership Bulgaria was transformed from an Ottoman province into a modern European state. Stambolov launched a new course in Bulgarian foreign policy, independent of the interests of any great power. His main foreign policy objective was the unification of the Bulgarian nation into a nation-state consisting of all the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate granted by the Sultan in 1870. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to oppose Russian- backed Greek and Serbian propaganda. As a result of Stambolov‚Äôs tactics, the Sultan recognised Bulgarians as the predominant people in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of a strong church and cultural institutions. Stambolov negotiated loans with western European countries to develop the economic and military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivated by his desire to create a modern army which could secure all of the national territory. His approach toward western Europe was one of diplomatic manoeuvring. He understood the interests of the Austrian Empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, and rapid economic and educational growth, leading to progressive social and cultural change, and development of a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria's independence. Stambolov was aware that Bulgaria had to be politically, militarily, and economically strong to achieve national unification. He mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power, respected by the great powers of the day. However, Bulgaria‚Äôs regional leadership was short-lived. After Stambolov's death the independent course of his policy was abandoned. Honours Stambolov Crag on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named for him. Stambolov is portrayed on the obverse of the Bulgarian 20 levs banknote, issued in 1999, 2007 and 2020.Bulgarian National Bank.

Schaums outline series, McGraw-Hill 1967 It does not use feedback to determine if its output has achieved the desired goal of the input command or process \\"set point\\". There are many open- loop controls, such as on/off switching of valves, machinery, lights, motors or heaters, where the control result is known to be approximately sufficient under normal conditions without the need for feedback. The advantage of using open-loop control in these cases is the reduction in component count and complexity. However, an open-loop system cannot correct any errors that it makes or correct for outside disturbances, and cannot engage in machine learning. Open-loop and closed-loop (feedback) control An electromechanical timer, normally used for open-loop control based purely on a timing sequence, with no feedback from the process. Fundamentally, there are two types of control loop: open-loop (feedforward) control, and closed loop (feedback) control. In open-loop control, the control action from the controller is independent of the \\"process output\\" (or \\"controlled process variable\\"). A good example of this is a central heating boiler controlled only by a timer, so that heat is applied for a constant time, regardless of the temperature of the building. The control action is the switching on/off of the boiler, but the controlled variable should be the building temperature, but is not as this is open-loop control of the boiler, which does not give closed- loop control of the temperature. In closed loop control, the control action from the controller is dependent on the process output. In the case of the boiler analogy this would include a thermostat to monitor the building temperature, and thereby feed back a signal to ensure the controller maintains the building at the temperature set on the thermostat. A closed loop controller therefore has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to give a process output the same as the \\"reference input\\" or \\"set point\\". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers. The definition of a closed loop control system according to the British Standard Institution is \\"a control system possessing monitoring feedback, the deviation signal formed as a result of this feedback being used to control the action of a final control element in such a way as to tend to reduce the deviation to zero.\\"  Applications  Electric clothes dryer, which is open-loop controlled by running the dryer for a set time, regardless of clothes dryness. An open-loop controller is often used in simple processes because of its simplicity and low cost, especially in systems where feedback is not critical. A typical example would be an older model domestic clothes dryer, for which the length of time is entirely dependent on the judgement of the human operator, with no automatic feedback of the dryness of the clothes. For example, an irrigation sprinkler system, programmed to turn on at set times could be an example of an open-loop system if it does not measure soil moisture as a form of feedback. Even if rain is pouring down on the lawn, the sprinkler system would activate on schedule, wasting water. Another example is a stepper motor used for control of position. Sending it a stream of electrical pulses causes it to rotate by exactly that many steps, hence the name. If the motor was always assumed to perform each movement correctly, without positional feedback, it would be open-loop control. However, if there is a position encoder, or sensors to indicate the start or finish positions, then that is closed-loop control, such as in many inkjet printers. The drawback of open-loop control of steppers is that if the machine load is too high, or the motor attempts to move too quickly, then steps may be skipped. The controller has no means of detecting this and so the machine continues to run slightly out of adjustment until reset. For this reason, more complex robots and machine tools instead use servomotors rather than stepper motors, which incorporate encoders and closed-loop controllers. However, open-loop control is very useful and economic for well-defined systems where the relationship between input and the resultant state can be reliably modeled by a mathematical formula. For example, determining the voltage to be fed to an electric motor that drives a constant load, in order to achieve a desired speed would be a good application. But if the load were not predictable and became excessive, the motor's speed might vary as a function of the load not just the voltage, and an open-loop controller would be insufficient to ensure repeatable control of the velocity. An example of this is a conveyor system that is required to travel at a constant speed. For a constant voltage, the conveyor will move at a different speed depending on the load on the motor (represented here by the weight of objects on the conveyor). In order for the conveyor to run at a constant speed, the voltage of the motor must be adjusted depending on the load. In this case, a closed-loop control system would be necessary. Thus there are many open-loop controls, such as switching valves, lights, motors or heaters on and off, where the result is known to be approximately sufficient without the need for feedback. Feedback control A feed back control system, such as a PID controller, can be improved by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed- forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open-loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward. For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open- loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system in some situations.

On this board players would sit left and right. Awal√© with the shape of an elephant Oware is an abstract strategy game among the Mancala family of board games (pit and pebble games) played worldwide with slight variations as to the layout of the game, number of players and strategy of play. Its origin is uncertain but it is widely believed to be of Akan origin. Played in the Bono Region, Bono East Region, Ahafo Region, Central Region, Western Region, Eastern Region, Ashanti Region of Ghana and throughout the Caribbean, Oware and its variants have many names - Ay√≤, Ayoayo (Yoruba), Awal√© (Ivory Coast, Benin), Wari (Mali), Ouri, Ouril or Uril (Cape Verde), Warri (Caribbean) Pallanguzhi (India) Wali (Dagbani), Adji (Ewe), Nch·ªç/√ìkw√® (Igbo), ise (Edo), Awale in (Ga) meaning Spoons in English according to the Ga name for the game. A common name in English is Awari but one of the earliest Western scholars to study the game, Robert Sutherland Rattray, used the name Wari. Rules Following are the rules for the abapa variation, considered to be the most appropriate for serious, adult play. Equipment The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. A typical oware board has two straight rows of six pits, called \\"houses\\", and optionally one large \\"score\\" house at either end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve smaller houses. Boards may be elaborately carved or simple and functional; they may include a pedestal, or be hinged to fold lengthwise or crosswise and latch for portability and storage with the seeds inside. While most commonly located at either end, scoring houses may be placed elsewhere, and the rows need not be straight. When a board has a hinged cover like a diptych, the scoring houses may be carved into the two halves of the cover, and so be in front of the players during play. The ground may also be used as a board; players simply scoop two rows of pits out of the earth. In the Caribbean, the seeds are typically nickernuts, which are smooth and shiny. Beads and pebbles are also sometimes used. In the West, some cheaper sets use oval-shaped marbles. Some tourist sets use cowrie shells. Object The game starts with four seeds in each house. The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to win the game. Since there is an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24. Sowing A player sowing seeds.Example turn: The lower player prepares to sow from E. After sowing, e, d, and c are captured but not a. Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under their control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. The starting house is always left empty; if it contained 12 (or more) seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. The diagram shows the result of sowing from house E. Knowing the number of seeds in each house is, of course, important to game play. When there are many seeds in a house, sometimes enough to make a full lap of the board or more, they cannot easily be counted by eye, and their number is often guarded by the player who controls that house. This may be done by repeatedly moving the seeds in the house. A player may count the seeds when contemplating a move; in such cases the last few are usually counted in the hand to avoid revealing their number. Capturing In Oware Abapa, capturing occurs only when a player brings the count of an opponent's house to exactly two or three with the final seed he sowed in that turn. This always captures the seeds in the corresponding house, and possibly more: If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is reached which does not contain two or three seeds or does not belong to the opponent. The captured seeds are placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). However, if a move would capture all of an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game, and the seeds are instead left on the board. (However, see discussion on Grand Slam variations below). In the adjacent diagram, the lower player would capture all the seeds in houses e, d, and c but not b (as it has four seeds) or a (since it is not contiguous to the other captured houses). Let the opponent play The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in their own territory, ending the game. Winning The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, the game ends when each player has seeds in his holes and then each player captures the seeds on their side of the board. Variations \\"Grand Slam\\" variations A grand slam is capturing all of an opponent's seeds in one turn. There are variations to the rule that applies, which may be one of the following: # Grand Slam captures are not legal moves. # Such a move is legal, but no capture results. International competitions often follow this rule. # Grand Slam captures are allowed, however, all remaining stones on the board are awarded to the opponent. # Such a move is legal, but the last (or first) house is not captured. Various other rules also exist. Variations allowing Grand Slams to end the game are strongly solved by Henri Bal and John Romein at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam in 2002; either side can force a draw. One commercial version was marketed in 1964 by 3M, as the board game Oh-Wah- Ree. History and society A game of awale Weight for weighing gold dust - Awele or Awari game ‚Äì Mus√©um de Toulouse Oware is perhaps the most widespread game in the mancala family of games. Considered the national game of Bono State, Ashanti City-State, oware is said to derive its name ‚Äî which literally means \\"he/she marries\\" ‚Äî from a legend in the Akan language and Twi, the language of the Akan people, about a man and a woman who played the game endlessly and, so as to be able to stay together and continue playing, they married. Reflecting traditional African values, players of oware encourage participation by onlookers, making it perhaps the most social two-player abstract. In recreational play, it is normal for spectators to discuss the game in progress and to advise the players. Games may provide a focus for entertainment and meeting others. The game, or variations of it, also had an important role in teaching arithmetic to African children.

Lady Macclesfield had two children by Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers, the second of whom was born at Fox Court, Holborn, on 16 January 1697, and christened two days later at St Andrew, Holborn, as Richard Smith. Six months later the child was placed with nurse Anne Portlock in Covent Garden. Nothing more is positively known of him, but Savage later claimed to be this child. He stated that he had been cared for by Lady Mason, his grandmother, who had put him in a school near St Albans, and by his godmother, one Mrs Lloyd. He said he had been pursued by the relentless hostility of his mother, by then Mrs Brett, who had prevented Lord Rivers from leaving ¬£6,000 to him, had tried to have him abducted to the West Indies and then apprenticed him as a shoemaker in Holborn. Savage claimed to have discovered his true identity in 1714, through reading some letters by Mrs Lloyd.Preface to Miscellaneous Poems, 1726. The first recorded occurrence of his name dates back to 1715, when he identified himself as \\"Mr. Savage, natural son to the late Earl Rivers\\" after being arrested for possessing a censored political pamphlet. He continued to use this name afterwards and gave further details of his parentage in Jacob's Poetical Register. Early career Savage's first certain work was a poem satirizing Bishop Hoadly, entitled The Convocation, or The Battle of Pamphlets (1717), which he afterwards tried to suppress. He adapted from the Spanish a comedy, Love in a Veil (acted 1718, printed 1719), which gained him the friendship of Sir Richard Steele, who became his first patron, and of Robert Wilks. With Steele, however, he soon quarrelled. In 1723 he played without success in the title role of his tragedy, Sir Thomas Overbury (1723), which nonetheless provided him a considerable amount of notoriety. By that time, Savage's story had become well known among literary circles, and he appeared lightly disguised in Eliza Haywood's novel Memoirs of a Certain Island Adjacent to the Kingdom of Utopia (1725). Haywood, an actress and best-selling novelist whose works were often a cause of scandal, purportedly had a romantic relationship with Savage, with whom she was rumored to have had a son. Savage actively participated with Haywood in the era's propensity for satire and praised her in several works, such as his prefatory poem for Haywood's Love in Excess. The two later quarrelled, and Savage satirized her in scathing terms in Authors of the Town (1725) and in An Author to be Let (1730), in which he referred to her as a \\"cast-off Dame\\" who \\"Writes Scandal in Romance.\\" Haywood was also lampooned as nothing more than a literary prostitute in Alexander Pope's The Dunciad, for which Savage was one of the chief sources of petty gossip about the \\"dunces\\" of Grub Street portrayed in the satire. In 1724 Savage was taken up by writer Aaron Hill, thus becoming part of a circle known as the \\"Hillarian Group\\", which included several young poets such as John Dyer and James Thomson. Hill promoted their work in the bi-weekly magazine The Plain Dealer. Savage's relationship with Hill, which developed over a period of ten years, proved instrumental in providing him the most important contacts in his career and, above all, in launching a persistent campaign to extort recognition and money from Mrs Brett. Savage's Miscellaneous Poems were published by subscription in 1726. Savage openly exposed the story of his birth in the Preface, and made repeated oblique references to his mother and his status of abandoned genius in many of the poems. Mrs Brett reportedly paid him money to suppress the Poems, either to soothe him or to silence him. 1727 trial On the night of 20 November 1727, Savage ran into two acquaintances, James Gregory and William Merchant. After staying out drinking until past midnight, they demanded a room at Robinson's coffeehouse near Charing Cross. Merchant, not being satisfied with being told to wait for a party of guests to depart, started a brawl in which Savage, amid the chaos, apparently stabbed and mortally wounded one James Sinclair, as well as injuring a maid. The following day, all three were committed in Newgate Prison, where they assured themselves that they would be charged with manslaughter, since no premeditation was involved in Sinclair's death. However, on 6 December, when they appeared at court at the Old Bailey, they were charged with murder. Sinclair's friends and the employees of Robinson's coffeehouse, moreover, proved pitiless in their testimony for the prosecution. A Mr. Nuttal, although not having seen Savage inflict the wound, suggested Sinclair had already surrendered when Savage attacked him, while Mr Limery, another of Sinclair's friends, saw Savage physically attack but reported that Sinclair still had his sword in hand. Further statements by Nuttal and Jane Leader, an employee at Robinson's, clearly established that in his final dying words Sinclair explicitly identified Savage as the man who stabbed him. The defence, on the other hand, tried to establish Savage's innocence by stressing the ill reputation of the Coffeehouse, by claiming that Savage acted in self-defence, and by insisting on the trustfulness and considerable social standing of the accused. The judge, Francis Page, was not impressed by their attempts, and in a speech filled with sarcastic comments made it clear to the jury what verdict he was expected to see delivered. At the end of an exceptionally long trial lasting eight hours, the jury found Savage and Gregory guilty of murder, and Merchant of manslaughter. Savage's and Merchant's friends and acquaintances solicited a pardon from the Crown, as was customary following a death sentence. These did not include Savage's mother, who not only maintained her lifelong hostility towards her supposed son, but also recounted an earlier incident in which Savage had broken into her house in one of his repeated attempts at reconciliation and, according to her, had instead attempted to murder her. Poet and playwright Charles Beckingham wrote a defensive pamphlet called The Life of Mr. Richard Savage, and even Lord Tyrconnel, Mrs Brett's own nephew, petitioned to the king and queen for a pardon. Savage eventually escaped the death penalty by the intercession of the Countess of Hertford, who appealed to Queen Caroline. Subsequent fame and decline Savage's conviction for murder and the subsequent pardon gained him a considerable amount of fame, and his story was sought over by booksellers and discussed in salons and coffeehouses, along with the behaviour of Mrs Brett. His newfound fame prompted him to publish in 1728 a confessional poem titled The Bastard, which made explicit mention of Mrs Brett, his trial and the pardon by the queen, and discarded his previous image of \\"poor poet\\" in favour of a celebration of his own genius. In 1729 Savage published The Wanderer, perhaps his best known work to date, a long narrative poem which showed the influence of James Thomson's The Seasons. Savage himself considered the poem to be his masterpiece. The turn of Savage's fortunes was also the result of a renewed campaign against his mother, which granted him in 1729 a fixed pension of the considerable amount of ¬£200 per annum. Savage apparently obtained this through repeated extortion, as Johnson recounts that he \\"threatened to harass her [Mrs. Brett] with Lampoons, and to publish a copious Narrative of her Conduct, unless she consented to purchase an Exemption from Infamy, by allowing him a Pension.\\" Thanks to this pension, Savage now bordered on opulence, along with an apartment in Arlington Street, and free supplies of wine and books, all at the expense of Lord Tyrconnel. Paradoxically, at the height of his popular fame, Savage was bound by his deal with Mrs Brett and Lord Tyrconnel to remain silent as a poet until 1735, except for an unusual arrangement with Queen Caroline to become a \\"Volunteer Laureate\\" which granted him from 1732 a further pension of ¬£50 per annum until the queen's death. The deal with Lord Tyrconnel also seemed to oblige Savage to dismiss his previous penchant for scandal in order to become a respectable member of society as his new patron was. The relationship between the two seemed genuinely based on Tyrconnel sympathy and admiration of Savage as a poet, and it was Tyrconnel himself who promoted him to the queen as a candidate for the laureateship. Savage's literary inactivity (interrupted only by his occasional poems to the queen and to Robert Walpole, which he unsuccessfully tried to win as a patron) ultimately seemed to irritate Lord Tyrconnel, and by 1735 their relationship had deteriorated to the point that Lord Tyrconnel forbade him to continue living in his apartment in Arlington Street and stopped providing him his pension. Now reduced to poverty, Savage became a frequent target for a growing number of satires and attacks, but began publishing again for Cave's The Gentleman's Magazine. Friendship with Samuel Johnson and final years Plaque on the wall of the old site of Bristol Newgate Prison It is not clear when Savage befriended writer Samuel Johnson, but it seems to have occurred in the latter years of the 1730s. How their friendship began is equally unclear, but Johnson relates having often accompanied Savage on his nighttime wanderings about London, where he witnessed the poet's poverty and frequent occurrences of public humiliation. These encounters provided much of the material for the Life of Savage. Johnson was fascinated by the independence, and the spirit of protest and outrage in Savage's character. He was also aware of the instability of mind which prevented Savage taking positive control of his life. In the meantime, Savage's financial situation worsened to the point that he had virtually no income. To save him from poverty, his longtime friend Alexander Pope launched a campaign involving several of his philanthropic acquaintances, including Ralph Allen, James Thomson and David Mallet. The purpose of this was to send Savage to Wales, where he could live with an annual allowance of ¬£50. Pope also tried to push Savage into writing a letter to Sir William Leman, Mrs Brett's legitimate daughter's husband, begging him to intervene on his behalf with Lord Tyrconnel. Savage refused outright, a decision which was applauded by Johnson, since he considered the scheme to send Savage to Wales equivalent to exile. Savage did eventually leave London in July 1739, thus breaking up his friendship with Johnson, with whom he had become a close literary ally. By spending his entire allowance as soon as he received it, Savage quickly alienated all his benefactors except Pope. When in Wales, Savage lived in Swansea, then in England at Bristol, where he completed a new version of Sir Thomas Overbury. Harassed by creditors and abandoned by friends, Savage reverted to a nocturnal existence. On the night of 10 January 1743, Savage was arrested for a debt of eight pounds and confined in the debtors' section of the Bristol Newgate Prison. He died there on 1 August 1743, probably from liver failure brought on by drinking. Parentage Savage's parentage, while the subject of some dispute, is central to his legend. Besides the story related by Johnson, a romantic account of Savage's origin and early life, for which he supplied the material, also appeared in Jacob's Poetical Register in 1719. Despite Savage's persistent claims that Mrs Brett was his mother, she never acknowledged him as such. She claimed that both the children she had by the Earl Rivers died shortly after birth, and that the boy was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, with the name of Richard Portlock. Lady Macclesfield's claims, however, are not incontrovertible, firstly because the boy buried as Richard Portlock may have been the son of nurse Ann Portlock (who Mrs Brett stated had named the baby); secondly, because of the yearly pension of ¬£200 Savage began receiving in 1729 by Lord Tyrconnel who, being Mrs Brett's nephew, seemed to recognize him to some degree. Savage's statements about his parentage, on the other hand, were not corroborated by the depositions of the witnesses in the Macclesfield divorce case, and Mrs Brett always maintained that he was an impostor. He was wrong in the date of his birth and, moreover, the godmother of Lady Macclesfield's son was Dorothy Ousley, not Mrs Lloyd. There is nothing to show that Mrs Brett was the cruel and vindictive woman he describes her to be. Discrepancies in Savage's story made James Boswell suspicious, but the matter was thoroughly investigated for the first time by William Moy Thomas, who published the results of his research in Notes and Queries. However, Clarence Tracy, in his seminal biography The Artificial Bastard did give weight to Savage's claims. In Richard Holmes' Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage the author, though not in complete agreement, did not discount Tracy's bias. Savage was also the subject of the play Richard Savage by J. M. Barrie and H. B. Marriott Watson. It premiered at London's Criterion Theatre in 1891 but was critically panned and performed only once.

It served as the colonial capital of the then Warri Province. It shares boundaries with Ughelli/Agbarho, Sapele, Okpe, Udu and Uvwie although most of these places, notably Uvwie, Okpe, and Udu have been integrated into the larger metropolitan area of Warri. Osubi houses an airport that serves the city. Effurun serves as the gateway to and the economic nerve of the city. The name Warri province was once applicable to the part of an area now called Delta State under the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Its boundary in the Northeast was Sapele/Udu creek near Ughelli and Aboh, with For√ßados River in the Southeast and Jameson Creek in the Southwest which later changed to Delta Province. Warri city is one of the major hubs of petroleum activities and businesses in southern Nigeria. It is a commercial capital city of Delta State, with a population of over 311,970 people according to the national population census figures for 2006. The city is one of cosmopolitan cities in southern Nigeria originally occupied by the Itsekiri also few urhobos and ijaws who are customary tenants Its inhabitants are predominantly Christian of different denominations, and some practice a mixture of African traditional religions like most of Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique Pidgin English. History Warri was once a provincial capital to British rule. The Lagos and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria were formally united as Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria on 28 February 1906 and Walter Egerton was appointed as the Governor of new Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, holding office until 1912.[3] In the new Southern Nigeria, the old Lagos Colony became the Western Province, and the former Southern Nigerian Protectorate was split into a Central Province with capital at Warri and an Eastern Province with capital at Calabar. Warri sits on the bank of River Warri which joined River Forcados and River Escravos through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the Niger River and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export. The city's history dates back to the 15th century when it was visited by Portuguese missionaries. Subsequently, it served as the base for Portuguese and Dutch slave traders. Warri became a more important port city during the late 19th century, when it became a centre for the palm oil trade and other major items such as rubber, palm products, cocoa, groundnuts, hides, and skins.http://www.greatestcities.com/Africa/Nigeria/Warri_city.html Warri was then established as a provincial headquarters by the British in the early 20th century. There have been a tremendous growth in the population; it has grown from being a rural area to an urban area. Demographics Warri is regarded as a modern metropolitan area with expanded infrastructural development in other local government areas such as Uvwie, Udu, and Okpe in recent years, with various road networks linking these places into one. Each of these areas has its own administrative structure. The major people in Warri city are the Urhobo, Ijaw and Itsekiri. However, due to its urban status, there is a large influx of people from all over the country, most notably the Igbos. Climate The region experiences moderate rainfall and moderate humidity for the most part of the year. The climate is monsoonal and is marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool \\"harmattan\\" dusty haze from the north-east winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief dry spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The area is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of and an annual rainfall amount of . There are high temperatures of and . The natural vegetation is of the rainforest with swamp forest in some areas. The forest is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees. Economy and infrastructure There is the Warri Refinery and Petrochemicals located at Ekpan, with the majority of international and local oil companies operating in Nigeria having their operational offices close by. One of the nation's major seaports is sited within Ugbuwangue, Warri. Delta Steel Company located at Aladja and Otorogu Gas Plants at Otu-jeremi, near Warri. After the crisis in 1999, it made most of the oil companies relocate out of the town Security Warri is garrisoned by the Amphibious Infantry battalion (Effurun Army Base) located in Effurun, a [twin city] to Warri and is administratively under the Brigade HQ in [Port Harcourt]. The Nigerian Navy operates from its facilities in Warri. The 61 Nigerian Air force Detachment also operates from its facilities in Jeddo, close to Warri Sports Warri has an international stadium with a capacity of 30,000 which is the home of Warri Wolves football club,Warri Wolves F.C.Warri Township Stadium which has hosted two editions of the African Women Football Championship in 2002 and 2006 respectively and was in contention as one of the venues to be used for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in Nigeria in 2009. The stadium was used to host the African Youth Athletics Championship (AYAC) in 2013. Warri Wolves, a professional football team based in Warri plays in the Nigeria National League. Their prominent former players include Best Ogedegbe, Wilson Oruma, Efe Ambrose, Victor Ikpeba and Ekigho Ehiosun. Manufacturing and raw materials The economic base of the city lies in the presence of a refinery and other oil and gas companies. Also, there is the steel company, Delta Steel Company, which is located in Ovwian‚ÄìAladja area of Udu. The Beta Glass Plant is located nearby, outside the town of Ughelli, where the land is rich in silica and silicates, raw materials required for the manufacture of glass, ceramics and cement. The Transcorp Power Distribution, one of Nigeria's power generating stations, is also located at Ughelli, which is just 15 minutes away by car. Transport Rail In 1991, construction started on a standard gauge railway from the steel mills at Ajaokuta to the port of Warri, about 275 km away. By 2006, the standard gauge lines had reached 329 km in length, but the final 27 km Warri section is still incomplete. In 2010, work recommenced to complete that final section to Warri. Road Major road networks within Warri Metropolis has been improved upon by the state government to improve the image of the city. Transportation within the city is mainly by bus and tricycle.

It can now be seen beside the church in R√∂k, √ñdesh√∂g Municipality, √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden. It is considered the first piece of written Swedish literature and thus it marks the beginning of the history of Swedish literature.Gustafson, Alrik, Svenska litteraturens historia, 2 volums (Stockholm, 1963). First published as A History of Swedish Literature (American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1961). Chapter 1.Forntid och medeltid, L√∂nnroth, in L√∂nnroth, G√∂ransson, Delblanc, Den svenska litteraturen, vol 1. About the stone The , tall stone was discovered built into the wall of the church in the 19th century and removed from the church wall a few decades later. The church was built in the 12th century, and it was common to use rune stones as building material for churches. The stone was probably carved in the early 9th century, judging from the main runic alphabet used (\\"short-twig\\" runes) and the form of the language. It is covered with runes on five sides except the base which was to be put under ground. A few parts of the inscription are damaged, but most of it remains legible. The name \\"R√∂k Stone\\" is something of a tautology: the stone is named after the village, \\"R√∂k\\", but the village is probably named after the stone, \\"Rauk\\" or \\"R√∂k\\" meaning \\"skittle-shaped stack/stone\\" in Old Norse. The stone is unique in a number of ways. It contains a fragment of what is believed to be a lost piece of Norse mythology. It also makes a historical reference to Ostrogothic king (effectively emperor of the western Roman empire) Theodoric the Great. It contains the longest extant pre-Christian runic inscription ‚Äì around 760 characters ‚Äì and it is a virtuoso display of the carver's mastery of runic expression. The inscription is partially encrypted in two ways; by displacement and by using special cipher runes. The inscription is intentionally challenging to read, using kennings in the manner of Old Norse skaldic poetry, and demonstrating the carver's command of different alphabets and writing styles (including code). The obscurity may perhaps even be part of a magic ritual. In 2015, it was proposed that the inscription has nothing at all to do with the recording of heroic sagas and that it contains riddles which refer only to the making of the stone itself.New interpretation of the R√∂k runestone inscription changes view of Viking Age (University of Gothenburg)Holmberg, Per (2015) Svaren p√• R√∂kstenens g√•tor: En socialsemiotisk analys av meningsskapande och rumslighet (\\"The answers to R√∂k stone riddles: A social analysis of the meaning and spatiality\\") Futhark: International Journal of Runic Studies, Vol. 6. pp. 65-106.

Reading directions for the 28 rows of text Translation The stone is housed under a roof and is located near the church in which it was discovered. The following is one translation of the text: most researchers agree on how the runes have been deciphered, but the interpretation of the text and the meaning are still a subject of debate. The first part is written in lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr meter, and the part about Theoderic is written in the fornyr√∞islag meter.

Interpretation Apart from Theodoric, Gunnr and the Norse god Thor, the people and mythological creatures mentioned are unknown to us. Some interpretations have been suggested: The two war-booties are likely to be two precious weapons, such as a sword and a shield or a helmet. Several stories like these exist in old Germanic poems. The Hreidgoths mentioned are a poetic name for the Ostrogoths, appearing in other sources. To what sea the name Hrei√∞sea referred is unknown. Considering the location of the Ostrogoths at the time of Theoderic, it should be a name for the Mediterranean. The part about Theodoric (who died in 526 A.D.) probably concerns the statue of him sitting on his horse in Ravenna, which was moved in 801 A.D. to Aachen by Charlemagne.Andren, A. Jennbert, K. Raudvere, C. \\"Old Norse Religion: Some Problems and Prospects\\" in Old Norse Religion in Long Term Perspectives: Origins, Changes and Interactions, an International Conference in Lund, Sweden, June 3-7, 2004. Nordic Academic Press. p. 11. This statue was very famous and portrayed Theodoric with his shield hanging across his left shoulder, and his lance extended in his right hand. The M√¶rings is a name for Theodoric's family. According to the old English Deor poem from the 10th century, Theodoric ruled the \\"castle of the M√¶rings\\" (Ravenna) for thirty years. The words about Theodoric may be connected to the previous statement, so the stone is talking about the death of Theodoric: he died approximately nine generations before the stone was carved, and the church considered him a cruel and godless emperor, thus some may have said that he died for his guilt. Gunnr whose \\"horse sees fodder on the battlefield\\" is presumably a Valkyrie (previously known from Norse mythology), and her \\"horse\\" is a wolf. This kind of poetic license is known as kenning in the old Norse poetry tradition. The story about the twenty kings says that the twenty were four groups of five brothers each, and in each of these four groups, all brothers shared the same names, and their fathers were four brothers (4 √ó 5 = 20). This piece of mythology seems to have been common knowledge at the time, but has been totally lost. The Sj√≥lund is similar to the name given to Roslagen by Snorri Sturluson but it has often been interpreted as Sj√¶lland (nowadays a part of Denmark). Starting with the Ingold-part, the text becomes increasingly hard to read. While the first part is written in the 16 common short-twig runes in the Younger Futhark, Varinn here switches over to using the older 24-type Elder Futhark and cipher runes. It has been assumed that this is intentional, and that the rows following this point concern legends connected specifically to Varinn and his tribe. After the word It is V√©linn ... follows the word Nit. This word remains uninterpreted, and its meaning is unclear. In the last line, the carver invokes the god Thor and then he says that Sibbi \\"of the shrine\\" got a son at the age of ninety. Since Thor is evoked before telling about Sibbi's connection with the sanctuary and his potency at old age, it may be a recommendation that being a devout worshipper is beneficial. Although much in the inscription is difficult to understand, its structure is very symmetrical and easy to perceive: it consists of three parts of (roughly) equal length, each containing two questions and one more or less poetic answer to those questions. As Lars L√∂nnroth and, after him, Joseph Harris have argued, the form is very similar to the so-called \\"greppaminni\\", a sort of poetic riddle game presented by Snorri Sturluson in his Prose Edda. Speculation There have been numerous speculations written about the stone and its purpose. The most common include: * Varinn carved the stone only to honour his lost son and the inclusion of mythical passages was a tribute from fantasy (Elias Wess√©n's theory). There is strong evidence to support this view, not the least being the fact that Thor is referenced; this use of a deity in this context is quite conceivably a prefiguration of what was to later become a common practice (anterior to Christianity), where graves were frequently inscribed with runic dedications such as √æ√≥rr vigi, \\"may Thor protect you\\". * Varinn carved the stone to raise his tribe to vengeance over the death of his son. The dramatic battle mentioned may have been the cause of his son's death. (Otto von Friesen's theory) * Varinn carved the stone to preserve the tribal myths, as he had the function of a thul, the ceremonial story-teller of his √¶tt (clan), and this retelling task was to be passed on to his son. Perhaps he feared that the stories could be lost because of the death of his son, and therefore he tried to preserve them in a short form in the stone. * The stone was a sign to strengthen the position of the tribe leader (since the stone could not be missed by anybody passing the land). He tries to justify his position by showing a long line of powerful ancestors which he follows. * The battlefield where twenty kings lie has been connected (at least by Herman Lindkvist) to the Battle of Br√°vellir, which in Norse mythology took place not far from the location of the R√∂k stone about 50 years earlier. * According to a hypothesis put forward by √Öke Ohlmarks, Varinn was the local chieftain and as such also the one who performed sacrifices to the gods. Then arrived Ansgar, the first to bring Christianity to Sweden, and the wife of Varinn's son V√©m√≥√∞r/V√°m√≥√∞r was baptized by him. Therefore, Varinn was forced to sacrifice his own son to the gods as indicated in the verse: \\"I say the folktale / to the young men, which of the line of Ingold was repaid by a wife's sacrifice\\" (the word \\"husl\\" can be interpreted both \\"sacrifice\\" and \\"baptism\\"). Shortly: V√©m√≥√∞r/V√°m√≥√∞r paid with his life for his wife's betrayal to the gods and Varinn had to kill his own son. That might also be the reason that Varinn used the word \\"faigian\\" (who is soon to die) instead of \\"dau√∞an\\" (dead) in the first line. * Researchers at three Swedish universities (University of Gothenburg, Uppsala University and Stockholm University) hypothesize that the inscription alludes to climate crisis, Fimbulwinter, following the extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536, which occurred 300 earlier, taking into consideration: the strongest known solar storm (774‚Äì775 carbon-14 spike) with its documented red skies, the exceptionally cold summer of 775 CE which affected crop yields, and the almost total solar eclipse in 810 CE, which gave the impression that the sun was extinguished shortly after dawn.  In popular culture  * A transcription of the runes feature on the cover of the 1990 Black Sabbath album Tyr.http://www.black-sabbath.com/discography/blacksabbath/tyr/ * Swedish Viking metal band King of Asgard released in 2010 the song \\"V√§mods Tale\\".

Cell growth occurs when the overall rate of cellular biosynthesis (production of biomolecules or anabolism) is greater than the overall rate of cellular degradation (the destruction of biomolecules via the proteasome, lysosome or autophagy, or catabolism). Cell growth is not to be confused with cell division or the cell cycle, which are distinct processes that can occur alongside cell growth during the process of cell proliferation, where a cell, known as the \\"mother cell\\", grows and divides to produce two \\"daughter cells\\". Importantly, cell growth and cell division can also occur independently of one another. During early embryonic development (cleavage of the zygote to form a morula and blastoderm), cell divisions occur repeatedly without cell growth. Conversely, some cells can grow without cell division or without any progression of the cell cycle, such as growth of neurons during axonal pathfinding in nervous system development. Cell division without cell growth during embryonic cleavage In multicellular organisms, tissue growth rarely occurs solely through cell growth without cell division, but most often occurs through cell proliferation. This is because a single cell with only one copy of the genome in the cell nucleus can perform biosynthesis and thus undergo cell growth at only half the rate of two cells. Hence, two cells grow (accumulate mass) at twice the rate of a single cell, and four cells grow at 4-times the rate of a single cell. This principle leads to an exponential increase of tissue growth rate (mass accumulation) during cell proliferation, owing to the exponential increase in cell number. Cell size depends on both cell growth and cell division, with a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell growth leading to production of larger cells and a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell division leading to production of many smaller cells. Cell proliferation typically involves balanced cell growth and cell division rates that maintain a roughly constant cell size in the exponentially proliferating population of cells. Some special cells can grow to very large sizes via an unusual \\"endoreplication\\" cell cycle in which the genome is replicated during S-phase but there is no subsequent mitosis (M-phase) or cell division (cytokinesis). These large endoreplicating cells have many copies of the genome, so are highly polyploid. Oocytes can be unusually large cells in species for which embryonic development takes place away from the mother's body within an egg that is laid externally. The large size of some eggs can be achieved either by pumping in cytosolic components from adjacent cells through cytoplasmic bridges named ring canals (Drosophila) or by internalisation of nutrient storage granules (yolk granules) by endocytosis (frogs).  Mechanisms of cell growth control  Cells can grow by increasing the overall rate of cellular biosynthesis such that production of biomolecules exceeds the overall rate of cellular degradation of biomolecules via the proteasome, lysosome or autophagy. Biosynthesis of biomolecules is initiated by expression of genes which encode RNAs and/or proteins, including enzymes that catalyse synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates. Individual genes are generally expressed via transcription into messenger RNA (mRNA) and translation into proteins, and the expression of each gene occurs to various different levels in a cell-type specific fashion (in response to gene regulatory networks). To drive cell growth, the global rate of gene expression can be increased by enhancing the overall rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II (for active genes) or the overall rate of mRNA translation into protein by increasing the abundance of ribosomes and tRNA, whose biogenesis depends on RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III. The Myc transcription factor is an example of a regulatory protein that can induce the overall activity of RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III to drive global transcription and translation and thereby cell growth. In addition, the activity of individual ribosomes can be increased to boost the global efficiency of mRNA translation via regulation of translation initiation factors, including the 'translational elongation initiation factor 4E' (eIF4E) complex, which binds to and caps the 5' end of mRNAs. The protein TOR, part of the TORC1 complex, is an important upstream regulator of translation initiation as well as ribosome biogenesis. TOR is a serine/threonine kinase that can directly phosphorylate and inactivate a general inhibitor of eIF4E, named 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), to promote translation efficiency. TOR also directly phosphorylates and activates the ribosomal protein S6-kinase (S6K), which promotes ribosome biogenesis. To inhibit cell growth, the global rate of gene expression can be decreased or the global rate of biomolecular degradation can be increased by increasing the rate of autophagy. TOR normally directly inhibits the function of the autophagy inducing kinase Atg1/ULK1. Thus, reducing TOR activity both reduces the global rate of translation and increases the extent of autophagy to reduce cell growth.  Cell growth regulation in animals  Many of the signal molecules that control of cellular growth are called growth factors, many of which induce signal transduction via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which includes upstream lipid kinase PI3K and the downstream serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, which is able to activate another protein kinase TOR, which promotes translation and inhibits autophagy to drive cell growth. Nutrient availability influences production of growth factors of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which circulate as hormones in animals to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cells to promote TOR activity so that when animals are well fed they will grow rapidly and when they are not able to receive sufficient nutrients they will reduce their growth rate. In addition, the availability of amino acids to individual cells also directly promotes TOR activity, although this mode of regulation is more important in single-celled organisms than in multicellular organisms such as animals that always maintain an abundance of amino acids in circulation. One disputed theory proposes that many different mammalian cells undergo size-dependent transitions during the cell cycle. These transitions are controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. Though the proteins that control Cdk1 are well understood, their connection to mechanisms monitoring cell size remains elusive. A postulated model for mammalian size control situates mass as the driving force of the cell cycle. A cell is unable to grow to an abnormally large size because at a certain cell size or cell mass, the S phase is initiated. The S phase starts the sequence of events leading to mitosis and cytokinesis. A cell is unable to get too small because the later cell cycle events, such as S, G2, and M, are delayed until mass increases sufficiently to begin S phase.  Cell populations  Cell populations go through a particular type of exponential growth called doubling or cell proliferation. Thus, each generation of cells should be twice as numerous as the previous generation. However, the number of generations only gives a maximum figure as not all cells survive in each generation. Cells can reproduce in the stage of Mitosis, where they double and split into two genetically equal cells.  Cell size  Cell size is highly variable among organisms, with some algae such as Caulerpa taxifolia being a single cell several meters in length. Plant cells are much larger than animal cells, and protists such as Paramecium can be 330 Œºm long, while a typical human cell might be 10 Œºm. How these cells \\"decide\\" how big they should be before dividing is an open question. Chemical gradients are known to be partly responsible, and it is hypothesized that mechanical stress detection by cytoskeletal structures is involved. Work on the topic generally requires an organism whose cell cycle is well-characterized.  Yeast cell size regulation  The relationship between cell size and cell division has been extensively studied in yeast. For some cells, there is a mechanism by which cell division is not initiated until a cell has reached a certain size. If the nutrient supply is restricted (after time t = 2 in the diagram, below), and the rate of increase in cell size is slowed, the time period between cell divisions is increased. Yeast cell-size mutants were isolated that begin cell division before reaching a normal/regular size (wee mutants).Wee1 mutants of S. pombe have small cell size and the homologous proteins in humans also regulate cell entry into mitosis; in Figure 1:Cell cycle and growth Wee1 protein is a tyrosine kinase that normally phosphorylates the Cdc2 cell cycle regulatory protein (the homolog of CDK1 in humans), a cyclin-dependent kinase, on a tyrosine residue. Cdc2 drives entry into mitosis by phosphorylating a wide range of targets. This covalent modification of the molecular structure of Cdc2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Cdc2 and prevents cell division. Wee1 acts to keep Cdc2 inactive during early G2 when cells are still small. When cells have reached sufficient size during G2, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphorylation, and thus activates Cdc2 to allow mitotic entry. A balance of Wee1 and Cdc25 activity with changes in cell size is coordinated by the mitotic entry control system. It has been shown in Wee1 mutants, cells with weakened Wee1 activity, that Cdc2 becomes active when the cell is smaller. Thus, mitosis occurs before the yeast reach their normal size. This suggests that cell division may be regulated in part by dilution of Wee1 protein in cells as they grow larger. Linking Cdr2 to Wee1 The protein kinase Cdr2 (which negatively regulates Wee1) and the Cdr2-related kinase Cdr1 (which directly phosphorylates and inhibits Wee1 in vitro) are localized to a band of cortical nodes in the middle of interphase cells. After entry into mitosis, cytokinesis factors such as myosin II are recruited to similar nodes; these nodes eventually condense to form the cytokinetic ring. A previously uncharacterized protein, Blt1, was found to colocalize with Cdr2 in the medial interphase nodes. Blt1 knockout cells had increased length at division, which is consistent with a delay in mitotic entry. This finding connects a physical location, a band of cortical nodes, with factors that have been shown to directly regulate mitotic entry, namely Cdr1, Cdr2, and Blt1. Further experimentation with GFP-tagged proteins and mutant proteins indicates that the medial cortical nodes are formed by the ordered, Cdr2-dependent assembly of multiple interacting proteins during interphase. Cdr2 is at the top of this hierarchy and works upstream of Cdr1 and Blt1. Mitosis is promoted by the negative regulation of Wee1 by Cdr2. It has also been shown that Cdr2 recruits Wee1 to the medial cortical node. The mechanism of this recruitment has yet to be discovered. A Cdr2 kinase mutant, which is able to localize properly despite a loss of function in phosphorylation, disrupts the recruitment of Wee1 to the medial cortex and delays entry into mitosis. Thus, Wee1 localizes with its inhibitory network, which demonstrates that mitosis is controlled through Cdr2-dependent negative regulation of Wee1 at the medial cortical nodes.  Cell polarity factors  Cell polarity factors positioned at the cell tips provide spatial cues to limit Cdr2 distribution to the cell middle. In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. Pombe), cells divide at a defined, reproducible size during mitosis because of the regulated activity of Cdk1. The cell polarity protein kinase Pom1, a member of the dual- specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) family of kinases, localizes to cell ends. In Pom1 knockout cells, Cdr2 was no longer restricted to the cell middle, but was seen diffusely through half of the cell. From this data it becomes apparent that Pom1 provides inhibitory signals that confine Cdr2 to the middle of the cell. It has been further shown that Pom1-dependent signals lead to the phosphorylation of Cdr2. Pom1 knockout cells were also shown to divide at a smaller size than wild-type, which indicates a premature entry into mitosis. Pom1 forms polar gradients that peak at cell ends, which shows a direct link between size control factors and a specific physical location in the cell. As a cell grows in size, a gradient in Pom1 grows. When cells are small, Pom1 is spread diffusely throughout the cell body. As the cell increases in size, Pom1 concentration decreases in the middle and becomes concentrated at cell ends. Small cells in early G2 which contain sufficient levels of Pom1 in the entirety of the cell have inactive Cdr2 and cannot enter mitosis. It is not until the cells grow into late G2, when Pom1 is confined to the cell ends that Cdr2 in the medial cortical nodes is activated and able to start the inhibition of Wee1. This finding shows how cell size plays a direct role in regulating the start of mitosis. In this model, Pom1 acts as a molecular link between cell growth and mitotic entry through a Cdr2-Cdr1-Wee1-Cdk1 pathway. The Pom1 polar gradient successfully relays information about cell size and geometry to the Cdk1 regulatory system. Through this gradient, the cell ensures it has reached a defined, sufficient size to enter mitosis. Other experimental systems for the study of cell size regulation One common means to produce very large cells is by cell fusion to form syncytia. For example, very long (several inches) skeletal muscle cells are formed by fusion of thousands of myocytes. Genetic studies of the fruit fly Drosophila have revealed several genes that are required for the formation of multinucleated muscle cells by fusion of myoblasts. Some of the key proteins are important for cell adhesion between myocytes and some are involved in adhesion-dependent cell-to-cell signal transduction that allows for a cascade of cell fusion events. Increases in the size of plant cells are complicated by the fact that almost all plant cells are inside of a solid cell wall. Under the influence of certain plant hormones the cell wall can be remodeled, allowing for increases in cell size that are important for the growth of some plant tissues. Most unicellular organisms are microscopic in size, but there are some giant bacteria and protozoa that are visible to the naked eye. See: Table of cell sizes ‚ÄîDense populations of a giant sulfur bacterium in Namibian shelf sediments‚Äî Large protists of the genus Chaos, closely related to the genus Amoeba In the rod-shaped bacteria E. coli, Caulobacter crescentus and B. subtilis cell size is controlled by a simple mechanisms in which cell division occurs after a constant volume has been added since the previous division. By always growing by the same amount, cells born smaller or larger than average naturally converge to an average size equivalent to the amount added during each generation. Cell division Cell reproduction is asexual. For most of the constituents of the cell, growth is a steady, continuous process, interrupted only briefly at M phase when the nucleus and then the cell divide in two. The process of cell division, called cell cycle, has four major parts called phases. The first part, called G1 phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required for DNA replication. The second part of the cell cycle is the S phase, where DNA replication produces two identical sets of chromosomes. The third part is the G2 phase in which a significant protein synthesis occurs, mainly involving the production of microtubules that are required during the process of division, called mitosis. The fourth phase, M phase, consists of nuclear division (karyokinesis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis), accompanied by the formation of a new cell membrane. This is the physical division of \\"mother\\" and \\"daughter\\" cells. The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases, sequentially known as prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase leading to cytokinesis. Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two \\"nuclear division\\" processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead to the production of two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell reproduction process of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes. The rest of this article is a comparison of the main features of the three types of cell reproduction that either involve binary fission, mitosis, or meiosis. The diagram below depicts the similarities and differences of these three types of cell reproduction. Cell growth Comparison of the three types of cell division The DNA content of a cell is duplicated at the start of the cell reproduction process. Prior to DNA replication, the DNA content of a cell can be represented as the amount Z (the cell has Z chromosomes). After the DNA replication process, the amount of DNA in the cell is 2Z (multiplication: 2 x Z = 2Z). During Binary fission and mitosis the duplicated DNA content of the reproducing parental cell is separated into two equal halves that are destined to end up in the two daughter cells. The final part of the cell reproduction process is cell division, when daughter cells physically split apart from a parental cell. During meiosis, there are two cell division steps that together produce the four daughter cells. After the completion of binary fission or cell reproduction involving mitosis, each daughter cell has the same amount of DNA (Z) as what the parental cell had before it replicated its DNA. These two types of cell reproduction produced two daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Chromosomes duplicate prior to cell division when forming new skin cells for reproduction. After meiotic cell reproduction the four daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes that the parental cell originally had. This is the haploid amount of DNA, often symbolized as N. Meiosis is used by diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes. In a diploid organism such as the human organism, most cells of the body have the diploid amount of DNA, 2N. Using this notation for counting chromosomes we say that human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (2N = 46) while human sperm and eggs have 23 chromosomes (N = 23). Humans have 23 distinct types of chromosomes, the 22 autosomes and the special category of sex chromosomes. There are two distinct sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. A diploid human cell has 23 chromosomes from that person's father and 23 from the mother. That is, your body has two copies of human chromosome number 2, one from each of your parents. Chromosomes Immediately after DNA replication a human cell will have 46 \\"double chromosomes\\". In each double chromosome there are two copies of that chromosome's DNA molecule. During mitosis the double chromosomes are split to produce 92 \\"single chromosomes\\", half of which go into each daughter cell. During meiosis, there are two chromosome separation steps which assure that each of the four daughter cells gets one copy of each of the 23 types of chromosome. Sexual reproduction Though cell reproduction that uses mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells, eukaryotes bother with the more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a selective advantage. Notice that when meiosis starts, the two copies of sister chromatids number 2 are adjacent to each other. During this time, there can be genetic recombination events. Information from the chromosome 2 DNA gained from one parent (red) will transfer over to the chromosome 2 DNA molecule that was received from the other parent (green). Notice that in mitosis the two copies of chromosome number 2 do not interact. Recombination of genetic information between homologous chromosomes during meiosis is a process for repairing DNA damages. This process can also produce new combinations of genes, some of which may be adaptively beneficial and influence the course of evolution. However, in organisms with more than one set of chromosomes at the main life cycle stage, sex may also provide an advantage because, under random mating, it produces homozygotes and heterozygotes according to the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg ratio.  Disorders  A series of growth disorders can occur at the cellular level and these consequently underpin much of the subsequent course in cancer, in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth and division beyond the normal limits, invasion (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood). Several key determinants of cell growth, like ploidy and the regulation of cellular metabolism, are commonly disrupted in tumors. Therefore, heterogenous cell growth and pleomorphism is one of the earliest hallmarks of cancer progression. Despite the prevalence of pleomorphism in human pathology, its role in disease progression is unclear. In epithelial tissues, pleomorphism in cellular size can induce packing defects and disperse aberrant cells. But the consequence of atypical cell growth in other animal tissues is unknown.  Measurement methods  The cell growth can be detected by a variety of methods. The cell size growth can be visualized by microscopy, using suitable stains. But the increase of cells number is usually more significant. It can be measured by manual counting of cells under microscopy observation, using the dye exclusion method (i.e. trypan blue) to count only viable cells. Less fastidious, scalable, methods include the use of cytometers, while flow cytometry allows combining cell counts ('events') with other specific parameters: fluorescent probes for membranes, cytoplasm or nuclei allow distinguishing dead/viable cells, cell types, cell differentiation, expression of a biomarker such as Ki67. Beside the increasing number of cells, one can be assessed regarding the metabolic activity growth, that is, the CFDA and calcein-AM measure (fluorimetrically) not only the membrane functionality (dye retention), but also the functionality of cytoplasmic enzymes (esterases). The MTT assays (colorimetric) and the resazurin assay (fluorimetric) dose the mitochondrial redox potential. All these assays may correlate well, or not, depending on cell growth conditions and desired aspects (activity, proliferation). The task is even more complicated with populations of different cells, furthermore when combining cell growth interferences or toxicity.

It is in Travelcard Zone 4 and passenger services are provided by Great Western Railway from and by TfL Rail to Heathrow Airport. It is down the line from Paddington and is situated between to the east and to the west. The station is managed by TfL Rail in preparation for Crossrail. It is estimated that in Autumn 2021, the TfL Rail service will be re-branded as the Elizabeth line. History Up freight passing Southall Station in 1961 Goods train coming off the Brentford Dock branch in 1961 The Great Western Railway opened Southall railway station on 1 May 1839, nearly one year after it opened its first railway line on 4 June 1838, between London Paddington and Maidenhead Riverside (the latter now known as Taplow). The Brentford Branch Line to Brentford Dock was opened for freight in 1859; a passenger service ran on the branch from 1860 until 1942, using the unnumbered platform at the south of the station (the line serving this platform is now only used as a relief line). From 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885 (when the service was discontinued as uneconomic) the District Railway ran trains between and Windsor which called at the station. The goods platforms opened as part of the original station; they were closed and dismantled in 1967. Southall station has bilingual station signage, owing to the large Punjabi community in the local area. Station signs on the platforms bear \\"Southall\\" and also \\"‡®∏‡®æ‡®ä‡®•‡®π‡®æ‡®≤\\" in Gurmukhƒ´, a script commonly used for the Punjabi language. In 2007, following issues raised by other ethnic groups in the area, First Great Western announced it would review the signage. The bilingual signs were kept, and they are still displayed at the station. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Wallsend (Latin), Hereford (Welsh), and St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International (all French). Layout and facilities Southall railway station has five platforms, one of which is unnumbered and used only for freight and special events. Access to all platforms is only by stairs. In normal circumstances, platforms 1 and 2, on the fast lines, and the unnumbered platform are not used by passengers; platforms 3 and 4 are used by all trains serving the station. The station building, above the fast lines, has a ticket office and a newsagent's shop. A footbridge gives access to platforms 3 and 4, while gates prevents access to the other three, under normal circumstances. Oyster \\"pay as you go\\" has been available since October 2008 for journeys to or from Southall. Although Southall is a busy station, automatic ticket barriers have not replaced manual ticket checks and standalone card readers, making the station vulnerable to fare evasion. Services Trains at Southall are operated by Great Western Railway and TfL Rail. The Monday-Saturday off- peak service is: * 6tph to * 2tph to * 2tph to Heathrow Terminal 4 * 2tph to The Sunday service is: * 6 tph to * 2tph to of which 1 continues to * 2tph to Heathrow Terminal 4 * 2tph to Future On 16 March 2010, the Crossrail Specialist Scrutiny Panel recommended that Crossrail should give consideration to the proposed regeneration developments in the area, including the Southall Gas Works development and the landscaping of unused work sites. In May 2011, Network Rail announced that it would make various alterations to prepare the station for Crossrail: * New station building with a new larger enclosed ticket hall with level access from South Road * Step-free access * Platforms 1 ‚Äì 4 extended * Improved passenger facilities including increased lighting and information and security systems Connections London Buses routes 105, 120, 195, 482, E5 and H32 serve the station. Accidents and incidents On 19 September 1997, a Great Western Trains passenger train from to failed to stop at a red signal and collided with a freight train, killing 7 people and injuring 139 others. The train driver, Larry Harrison, was charged with manslaughter, but the case against him was dropped. Great Western Trains was fined ¬£1.5 million for the crash. Following this accident and the more serious Ladbroke Grove Rail Crash some miles east, First Great Western requires all its trains to have their ATP switched on at all times. If the equipment is faulty, the train is stored out of use. In 2007, analysis by First Great Western after several deaths at Southall station found that a third of the suicides on English and Welsh railways occurred on the line between Slough and Paddington. * Southall Railway Centre‚Äìa heritage railway centre, based in part of the former Southall locomotive depot (visible from the station: to the south of the main line, looking towards Paddington).

The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 3,100. Blenheim Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is next to Woodstock, in the parish of Blenheim. Winston Churchill was born in the palace in 1874 and buried in the nearby village of Bladon. Edward, elder son of King Edward III and heir apparent, was born in Woodstock Manor on 15 June 1330. In his lifetime he was commonly called Edward of Woodstock, but is known today as the Black Prince. In the reign of Queen Mary I, her half-sister Elizabeth was imprisoned in the gatehouse of Woodstock Manor. History The name Woodstock is Old English in origin, meaning a \\"clearing in the woods\\". The Domesday Book of 1086 describes Woodstock (Wodestock, Wodestok, Wodestole) as a royal forest. √Üthelred the Unready, king of England, is said to have held an assembly at Woodstock at which he issued a legal code now known as IX √Üthelred.See Prosophography of Anglo-Saxon England . In the 17th century Robert Plot wrote that King Alfred stayed at Woodstock about the year 890 when he translated Boethius' Consolations of Philosophy. . The source cited by him was a \\"Cotton Otho A\\" manuscript, but no such manuscript has produced evidence of this. It may have been Cotton Otho A.x, destroyed in the Ashburnham House fire of October 1731, though the catalogues by Humfrey Wanley and Franciscus Junius make no mention of this. King Henry I may have kept a menagerie in the park. Woodstock was the scene of King Henry II's courtship of Rosamund Clifford (Fair Rosamund). The market of the town was established when King Henry II gave Woodstock a Royal charter in 1179. The Bear Hotel in Park Street opposite The Oxfordshire Museum dates from the 13th century. In the Hundred Rolls of 1279 Woodstock is described as a vill, but a burgess is alluded to in the same document, and it returned two members to parliament as a borough in 1302 and 1305. The earliest known municipal charter was that from Henry VI in 1453, establishing the vill of New Woodstock a free borough, with a merchant guild, and incorporating the burgesses under the title of the \\"Mayor and Commonalty of the Vill of New Woodstock.\\" The borough was exempted from sending representatives to parliament, but started to return two members in the 16th century. Near the village was Woodstock Palace, a residence that was popular with several English kings throughout the medieval period. The building was destroyed in the English Civil War. 60 years later the palace remains were cleared for the building of Blenheim Palace. From the 16th century the town prospered by making gloves. In the 17th century the town was altered greatly, when the 1st Duke of Marlborough became a permanent resident. The town has a successful fine steelwork industry by 1720 and by 1742 its products were of high enough quality to be considered viable diplomatic gifts. By the end of the 18th century this had developed into Cut steel jewellery. Today it is largely dependent on tourists, many of whom visit Blenheim Palace. Bell-foundry By 1626 James Keene, who had a bell-foundry in Bedford, had started one in Woodstock. Until 1640 another member of the family, Humphrey Keene, was a bell-founder with him. James died in 1654 and was succeeded by his son Richard. Richard Keene apparently closed the Woodstock foundry in the 1680s but continued casting bells at Royston, Hertfordshire until 1703. Numerous parish churches still have one or more bells cast by the Keenes, including at Asthall, Bloxham, Cassington, Charlton-on-Otmoor, Chastleton, Chesterton, Duns Tew, Eynsham, Garsington, Islip, Kiddington, Merton, Milton, North Moreton, Oddington, Rousham, Sandford St Martin, Stanton Harcourt, Steeple Aston, Steeple Barton, Stratton Audley, Tackley, Towersey and Woodeaton in Oxfordshire, Stowe in Buckinghamshire, Stanton in Gloucestershire, Middleton Cheney in Northamptonshire and Martley in Worcestershire. South front of Blenheim Palace Blenheim Palace The Palace was designed by John Vanbrugh, in a heavy Italo-Corinthian style. It was designated to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough. Most of the palace was paid for by the nation. Churchill had been given the manor in perpetuity in honour of his victories over the French and the Bavarians at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession. The original manor, mostly ruined, was demolished as part of the project. The greater part of the art treasures and curios were sold off in 1886, and the great library collected by Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, the son-in-law of the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1881. The magnificent park contains Fair Rosamund's Well, near which stood her bower. On the summit of a hill stands a column commemorating the duke. Blenheim Park forms a separate parish. Elizabeth I When Thomas Wyatt led an uprising in 1554 to depose Queen Mary I and put Princess Elizabeth on the throne in her place, Elizabeth was imprisoned in a lodge in Woodstock as a precaution. The lodge was used because the now lost Woodstock Palace or manor house was too dilapidated to house her. A survey in 1551 reported that \\"the mansion... for many years past hath been decayed.\\" While imprisoned, Elizabeth wrote a poem. \\"Much suspected by [of] me, None proved can be.\\", citing and She was released in April 1555 after nearly a year in captivity. The town Chaucers Lane, Woodstock The River Glyme, in a steep valley, divides the town into New and Old Woodstock. The town has two main suburbs: Hensington to the south and east of the town centre, and Old Woodstock to the north. The town hall of Woodstock was built in 1766 to designs by Sir William Chambers, and there are a number of 17th- century buildings in the town centre. The almshouses were built in 1798 on behalf of Caroline, duchess of Marlborough. Chaucer's House was once home to Chancellor of England, Thomas Chaucer, thought to be the son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The Church of England parish church of St Mary Magdalene has a Norman doorway. The church has a turret clock that John Briant of Hertford made in 1792. The parish is now part of the Benefice of Blenheim, which also includes Begbroke, Bladon, Shipton-on-Cherwell and Yarnton. The Oxfordshire Museum, the county museum of Oxfordshire, occupies a large historic house, Fletcher's House, in the centre of Woodstock. The museum has a garden containing works of art and a Dinosaur Garden with a full-size replica of a Megalosaurus. Both the primary school and The Marlborough School, the secondary school, are in Shipton Road. There is nursery provision through WUFA (Woodstock Under Fives Association). Oxford School of Drama is at Sansom's Farm, in the north of Woodstock parish. The current Mayor of the Town is Mathew Parkinson. Sport and leisure Woodstock has a Non-League football club Woodstock Town who play at New Road, and was promoted to the Hellenic Football League Premier Division for the 2008‚Äì09 season. They are currently in Hellenic League Division 2 North.

Though it derives from an outdated name for this lineage (see below), some still find the term \\"chondrophore\\" useful as a synonym to \\"porpitid\\" in discussions of the two genera contained therein. They all live at the surface of the open ocean, and are colonies of carnivorous, free-floating hydroids whose role in the plankton community is similar to that of pelagic jellyfish. The chondrophores look like a single organism but are actually colonial animals, made up of orderly cooperatives of polyps living under specialized sail-structures. The most familiar members of the family Porpitidae are the blue button (Porpita porpita) and the by-the-wind sailor (Velella velella). Description Velella velella on the southern coast of Sicily. The tiny individual animals are specialized to perform specific tasks; some form the central gas-filled disc (which is a golden brown colour and hardened by chitinous material) essential to keeping the colony afloat; others form radiating tentacles for tasks such as catching prey, reproduction, and digestion. Microplankton is a chondrophore's principal prey. Although none have powerful stings, contact with the skin may cause irritation. At the mercy of winds and currents, chondrophores are pelagic and drift in the open ocean. They are often seen in large aggregations; mass beachings are not unusual. Chondrophores multiply by releasing tiny (0.3-2.5 millimetres or 0.01-0.09 inches) medusae which go on to develop new colonies. Velella differs from Porpita by their transparent, membranous sail-shaped floats; filled with gas, the membranes have a texture reminiscent of cellophane. Both genera have turquoise to dark blue mantles and tentacles, with lemon-yellow morphs occasionally encountered. Neither group is particularly large: the floats of Velella are usually under 7.6 centimetres (3 inches) in diameter, while those of Porpita are usually less than 3.8 centimetres (1.5 inches). Systematics The order Chondrophora was created by A.K. Totton in 1954 to accommodate these unusual genera of Hydrozoa as their taxonomic affinities were unclear.Totton (1954) They had previously been placed either in the Anthomedusae (also known as Athecata) or the Siphonophora, and though many accepted Totton's placement, a considerable number of authors maintained them in the Anthomedusae/Athecata all the time. By the 1970s/1980s, nearly all Hydrozoan systematists were in agreement that these genera did indeed belong in that groupBrinckmann-Voss (1970) and the order Chondrophora became defunct, replaced by the family Porpitidae, which took priority over the more recent name Velellidae (the group was subdivided into these two families when still ranked as an order). In modern classifications, the Porpitidae are included in the hydrozoan suborder Capitata.Schuchert (2008) They are believed to have originated in the late Proterozoic period, some 650-540 million years ago.

Epic theatre is not meant to refer to the scale or the scope of the work, but rather to the form that it takes.https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/brecht-interruptions- and-epic-theatre Epic theatre emphasizes the audience's perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way. The purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief, but rather to force them to see their world as it is.  History  The term \\"epic theatre\\" comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as director of Berlin's Volksb√ºhne (1924‚Äì27).Wiles (1980). Piscator aimed to encourage playwrights to address issues related to \\"contemporary existence.\\" This new subject matter would then be staged by means of documentary effects, audience interaction, and strategies to cultivate an objective response.Innes (1972). Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what Brecht calls gestus. One of Brecht's most-important aesthetic innovations prioritised function over the sterile dichotomous opposition between form and content.Willett (1964) 281. Epic theatre and its many forms is a response to Richard Wagner's idea of \\"Gesamtkunstwerk\\", or \\"total artwork\\", which intends each piece of art is composed of each other art form. Since epic theatre is so focused on the specific relationship between form and content, these two ideas contradict each other, despite the fact that Brecht was heavily influenced by Wagner. Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work \\"A Short Organum for the Theatre\\".Brecht (1949, 276). Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it. Near the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term \\"dialectical theatre\\" to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term \\"epic theatre\\" had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to Manfred Wekwerth, one of Brecht's directors at the Berliner Ensemble at the time, the term refers to the \\"'dialecticising' of events\\" that this approach to theatre-making produces.Quoted by Willett (1964) 282. Epic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early naturalistic approach and later \\"psychological realism\\" developed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of melodrama; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of Stanislavski's system and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht's own social and political focus was distinct, too, from surrealism and the Theatre of Cruelty, as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of Antonin Artaud, who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced 'shock' in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension. Techniques Verfremdungseffekt While not invented by Brecht, the Verfremdungseffekt, known in English as the \\"estrangement effect\\" or the \\"alienation effect\\", was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of epic theatre. Some of the ways the Verfremdungseffekt can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and \\"break the fourth wall\\" by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in The Caucasian Chalk Circle is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work. Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality. As with the principle of dramatic construction involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls \\"non-Aristotelian drama\\", the epic approach to play production utilizes a montage technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and interruptions. While the French playwright Jean Genet articulates a very different world view in his dramas from that found in Brecht's, in a letter to the director Roger Blin on the most appropriate approach to staging his The Screens in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production: Historicisation Historicisation is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays Mother Courage and Her Children and The Good Person of Szechwan, both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts. Brecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a music hall turn that is able to stand on its own. Common production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic scenic design offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used comedy to distance his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers, putting music and song in his plays. Acting in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have \\"become\\" the characters. This is called Gestus, when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character (\\"breaking the fourth wall\\") and play multiple roles. Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another. For example, a character could say, \\"I could have stayed at home, but instead I went to the shops.\\" This he called \\"fixing the Not / But element\\".

According to the Book of Mormon, the prophet Mormon engraved an abridgement of his people's history on golden plates. Based on the chronology described in the book, Mormon lived during the 4th century AD. As a narrator in the text, Mormon presents himself as a redactor. He quotes and paraphrases other writers, collects and includes whole texts by other authors, contributes running commentary, and also writes his own narrative. He writes about the process of making the book, both in terms of compiling the works of other prophets and also in terms of engraving the words on metal plates. He alludes to content that is left out of the book, and refers to a larger collection of records at his disposal. The Book of Mormon states that Mormon was instructed by the prophet Ammaron where to find the records that had been passed down from their ancestors. It also says that Mormon later abridged the near-millennium-long history of his ancestors, and added additional revelations into the Book of Mormon. Divisions of the book relating to Mormon's personal history are the Words of Mormon and the first seven chapters of the larger book. The book says that Mormon eventually passed all of the records on to his son Moroni. Life history According to Mormon's record in the Book of Mormon, he was born in about AD 311 to a father whose name was also Mormon, but was named \\"after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people\\".. At about the age of ten, he was visited by Ammaron and given instructions on where to find the sacred engravings of the Nephite prophets and what to engrave upon them.. At the age of eleven, Mormon was taken to the land of Zarahemla by his father.. Mormon writes that at age fifteen he was visited by Jesus Christ.. In his \\"sixteenth year,\\" in AD 326, being young but \\"large in stature\\", Mormon \\"was appointed by the people of Nephi\\" to be the leader of their armies,. and fought against the Lamanites in many battles thereafter. Mormon 1:2 Mormon went to the hill Shim at about the age of 24, as instructed by Ammaron,. to take and abridge the Nephite records.. In AD 362, Mormon writes that he \\"utterly refuse[d]...to be a commander and a leader\\" to the Nephites \\"because of their wickedness and abomination.\\". However, about thirteen years later, Mormon decided to return as commander of the Nephite armies as they were being badly beaten by the Lamanites.. Upon returning, Mormon again led them in battle against the Lamanites until the entire destruction of the Nephite nation, which took place as a result of a huge battle fought between the two groups in 385.. The prophet Moroni, Mormon's son to whom he delivered the golden plates, records that Mormon was killed by the Lamanites (presumably in AD 385 or shortly thereafter). As the last prophet and keeper of the record, Moroni is said to have become the angel or messenger who revealed the location of the golden plates to Joseph Smith in 1823..Joseph Smith‚ÄîHistory 1:27-54 In AD 385, Mormon witnesses the destruction of the Nephite people and their armies as they battle against the Lamanites (Mormon 6:1). Mormon is 74 years old at the time (AD 385 minus 326 years after the birth of Christ when Mormon said he was 15 years old (16th year), see Mormon 2:2). 15 years later in AD 400 (Mormon 8), Moroni finishes his father's record (Mormon 8:1) and mentions that his father was killed after the battle against the Lamanites at the Hill Cumorah (Mormon 8:3), which would have been after AD 385, making Mormon at least 74 years old when he died. Meaning of the name Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley noted the prevalence of names in the Book of Mormon with the root \\"mor\\" and suggested that the root may be of Egyptian origin with the meaning of \\"beloved\\".See Hugh W. Nibley, Teachings of The Book of Mormon. Semester 3, Lecture 71 However, in the 15 May 1843 issue of the Times and Seasons, Joseph Smith explained the name as being a contraction of the English word \\"more\\" and \\"mon\\", a word that Smith claimed was Egyptian for \\"good\\", making the name literally mean \\"more good\\".Joseph Smith Junior.

Born into a wealthy Catholic family, Sarsfield joined a regiment recruited by James Scott, Duke of Monmouth for the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, a subsidiary of the Franco-Dutch War. After England made peace, his regiment served in the French Rhineland campaign, and when the war ended in 1678, he returned to England. Following the so-called Popish Plot, Catholics were barred from the English military, and for the next few years Sarsfield led a precarious life on the fringes of London society. When the Catholic James II came to the throne in 1685, Sarsfield served as a volunteer during Monmouth's Rebellion, and was commissioned into the Royal Army. A colonel by the time of the Glorious Revolution in November 1688, he remained loyal to James, and followed him into exile in France. He returned to Ireland in March 1689 as a senior commander in the Jacobite army, and was elected to the short-lived Patriot Parliament. As leader of the 'War Party', by late 1690 he largely controlled Jacobite military strategy, and was given the title Earl of Lucan. Their position became hopeless after Aughrim in July, and Sarsfield helped negotiate the 1691 Treaty of Limerick ending the war. It included an agreement under which thousands of Irish soldiers went into exile in France, later known as the \\"Flight of the Wild Geese\\". Many served in the Nine Years War, including Sarsfield, who was killed at the Battle of Landen in 1693. While contemporaries universally acknowledged his courage, opinions of his judgement and intelligence were mixed. Nevertheless, his reputation and death meant in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he was widely commemorated in Ireland and among the international Irish diaspora as a military hero. Biography Originally of English descent, the Sarsfield family were wealthy Roman Catholic merchants, who settled in Dublin; Sir William Sarsfield was knighted in 1566, reportedly for providing the Crown financial support during O'Neill's rebellion. He purchased Lucan Manor, a large estate now a suburb of Dublin, and Tully Commandery in County Kildare. Sarsfield's father Patrick (ca 1628-after 1693) married Anne O'Moore, daughter of Rory O'Moore, a Gaelic noble who played a leading part in the 1641 rebellion. This was emphasised by 19th century writers seeking to bolster Sarsfield's status as an Irish hero, although nationalist historian O'Callaghan claimed he was \\"no better than a puffed Palesman\\", compared to figures such as Eoghan Ruadh √ì N√©ill. During the 1641 to 1652 Irish Confederate Wars, his father fought for the Catholic Confederacy, but belonged to the moderate faction that sought an agreement with Protestant Irish Royalists. Although his estates were confiscated in 1652, they were returned in 1662. His eldest son William married Mary Crofts, reputedly an illegitimate daughter of Charles II and younger sister of James Scott, Duke of Monmouth. In 1689, Sarsfield married the 15 year old Honora Burke (1674-1698), daughter of William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde; they had one son, James Sarsfield, 2nd Earl of Lucan (1693-1719). After Sarsfield's death, she married James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, eldest but illegitimate son of James II of England. Catalina Sarsfield, who styled herself Queen of the brief-lived Kingdom of Corsica, is often cited as Sarsfield's daughter. She was in fact a distant cousin; her father David Sarsfield came from another branch of the family, and was killed at the Battle of Villaviciosa in 1710. Early Career; France and England James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, Sarsfield's relation by marriage, who gave him a commission in his regiment There are few surviving records of Sarsfield's early life, although it is generally agreed he was brought up on the family estates at Tully. While some biographies claim he was educated at a French military college, there is no evidence for this. In the 1670 Treaty of Dover, Charles II agreed to support a French attack on the Dutch Republic, and supply a brigade of 6,000 troops for the French army. When the Franco-Dutch War began in 1672, Sarsfield was commissioned into Monmouth's regiment, which formed part of this unit. When England left the war in 1674, the Brigade continued to serve in the Rhineland, under Turenne; Sarsfield transferred into a regiment commanded by Irish Catholic Sir George Hamilton. Sarsfield fought in the battles of Entzheim, Turckheim, and Altenheim; he and Hamilton were standing next to Turenne when he was killed by a chance shot at Salzbach in July 1675. He remained in France until the war ended in 1678, then returned to London to join a new regiment being recruited by the Earl of Limerick; he was caught up in the Popish Plot, and like other Catholics barred from serving in the military. Having lost his career, he was often short of money and became involved in an expensive legal campaign to regain Lucan Manor from the heirs of his brother William, who died in 1675. This ultimately proved unsuccessful amid allegations of forged documents, and in 1681 he returned to London, where he made two separate attempts to abduct an heiress and was lucky to escape prosecution. Restored to favour when Charles's Catholic brother James became king in 1685, Sarsfield helped suppress the Monmouth Rebellion; he was unhorsed and \\"wounded in several places\\" at the decisive Battle of Sedgemoor. As James was keen to promote Catholics, this revitalised his military career, and by 1688 he was colonel of a cavalry unit. After Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1687, he began creating a Catholic-dominated Irish army and political establishment. Aware of preparations for invasion by his nephew and son-in-law William of Orange, James sent Sarsfield to Dublin in September to persuade Tyrconnell to provide him Irish troops. This proved unsuccessful, and in November James was deposed by the Glorious Revolution. Sarsfield took part in the Wincanton Skirmish, one of the few military actions during the invasion; he remained in England until January, when he was allowed to join James in France. Williamite War in Ireland Tyrconnell; he and Sarsfield became bitter opponents over Jacobite policy in Ireland Accompanied by French troops and English exiles, James landed in Ireland in March 1689, beginning the Williamite War in Ireland. Sarsfield was promoted brigadier, elected to the 1689 Irish Parliament for Dublin County, and commanded cavalry units in the campaign in Ulster and Connacht. When an Irish brigade was sent to France in October, French ambassador D'Avaux proposed Sarsfield as its commander. He noted that while \\"not...of noble birth [...], (he) has distinguished himself by his ability, and (his) reputation in this kingdom is greater than that of any man I know [...] He is brave, but above all has a sense of honour and integrity in all that he does\\". James rejected this, stating that although unquestionably brave, Sarsfield was 'very scantily supplied with brains.' His role at the Boyne was peripheral, although the battle was less decisive than often assumed, Jacobite losses being around 2,000 from a force of 25,000. James returned to France, leaving Tyrconnell in control; he was leader of the \\"Peace Party\\", who wanted to negotiate a settlement preserving Catholic rights to land and public office. Sarsfield headed the \\"War Party\\", who felt they could gain more by fighting on; it included the Luttrell brothers, Nicholas Purcell, and English Catholic William Dorrington, a former colleague from Monmouth's Regiment. The position of the War Party was strengthened by the Declaration of Finglas, which offered the rank and file amnesty, but excluded senior officers. French victories in the Low Countries briefly increased hopes of a Stuart restoration, and the Jacobites established a defensive line along the Shannon. Sarsfield cemented his reputation with an attack on the Williamite artillery train at Ballyneety, widely credited with forcing them to abandon the siege of Limerick. The Jacobites also retained Athlone, offset by the loss of Kinsale and Cork, which made resupply from France extremely difficult. With Tyrconnell absent in France, Sarsfield took control and in December 1690, arrested several leaders of the peace faction. He then bypassed James by asking Louis XIV direct for French support, and requesting the removal of Tyrconnell and the army commander Berwick, James' illegitimate son. The latter, who later described Sarsfield as \\"a man [...] without sense\\", albeit \\"very good natured\\", left Limerick for France in February. The Battle of the Boyne, July 1690 Tyrconnell returned in January 1691, carrying letters from James making Sarsfield Earl of Lucan, an attempt to placate an \\"increasingly influential and troublesome figure\\". A large French convoy arrived at Limerick in May, along with St Ruth, appointed military commander in an attempt to end the conflict between the factions. St Ruth and 7,000 others died at Aughrim in July, reputedly the bloodiest battle ever on Irish soil. Sarsfield's role is unclear: one account claims he quarrelled with St Ruth, and was sent to the rear with the cavalry reserves. The remnants of the Jacobite army regrouped at Limerick; Tyrconnell died of a stroke in August, and in October, Sarsfield negotiated terms of surrender. He has been criticised for this, having constantly attacked Tyrconnell for advocating the same thing, while it is suggested the Williamite army was weaker than he judged. However, the collapse of the Shannon line and surrender of Galway and Sligo left him little option; without French supplies, the military position was hopeless, and defections meant his army was dissolving. The military articles of the Treaty of Limerick preserved the Jacobite army by allowing its remaining troops to enter French service; about 19,000 officers and men, including Sarsfield, chose to leave. His handling of the civil articles was less successful; most of its protections were ignored by the new regime, although Sarsfield may have viewed it as temporary, hoping to resume the war. Exile and death On arrival in France, Sarsfield became Major-General in the army of exiles, an appointment James made with great reluctance. In addition to other acts of perceived insubordination, Sarsfield allegedly told William's negotiators at Limerick \\"change but kings with us, and we will fight it over again\\". After the planned invasion of England was abandoned in 1692, the exiles became part of the French army, and Sarsfield a French marechal de camp. He fought at Steenkerque in August 1692, and was fatally wounded at the Battle of Landen in 1693, dying at Huy three days later. Despite several searches no grave or burial record has been found, though a plaque at St Martin's church, Huy, has been set up in commemoration. Like much else, his reputed last words, \\"Oh that this had been shed for Ireland!\\", are apocryphal. Legacy Sarsfield as Irish patriot: 1881 statue in Limerick Sarsfield left few contemporary records, and those that exist are \\"disconcertingly incomplete\\". It is impossible to determine his precise political views, almost nothing is known of his family life, and none of the alleged portraits of him can be authenticated. This allowed later writers to use him as a vehicle for their own needs, especially his portrayal as the \\"heroic ideal of an Irish soldier\\". His success at Ballyneety remains his most famous achievement, although a 1995 study suggests it had limited military value, and his men may have indiscriminately slaughtered women and children. He has also been criticised for the role he played in creating divisions within the Jacobite camp; senior officers considered him rash and easily manipulated, although he seems to have been popular with the rank and file. Mythologising began during his lifetime; the poet D√°ibh√≠ √ì Bruadair, 1625 to 1698, composed a panegyric describing Sarsfield as virtuous, heroic, popular and a great leader, but admitted they had not met. The anonymous song \\"Sl√°n le P√°draig S√°irse√°l\\", or \\"Farewell to Patrick Sarsfield\\", is considered a classic of Irish-language poetry. 19th century nationalists like Thomas Davis celebrated him as a national hero and patriot, while in the early 20th century he was also depicted as a staunch Catholic. During the 1912 to 1914 Home Rule crisis, his image as a brave and honourable patriot was used to counter Unionist claims that Catholics, and by definition nationalists, were incapable of self-government. When the Irish Folklore Commission began collecting material in the 1930s, they recorded many oral narratives about Sarsfield, including stories of buried gold, generosity to the poor, having his horse shod backward to escape from pursuers, and apparitions of dogs or white horses. The global Irish diaspora meant his name and reputation were commemorated beyond Ireland; Michael Corcoran, a Federal general in the US Civil War, claimed to be a direct descendant. From 1870 to 1880, a unit in the California National Guard formed from recruits of Irish descent was called the Sarsfield Grenadier Guards. Towns that bear his name include Sarsfield, Ontario, and Sarsfield in Victoria, Australia. \\"Sarsfield\\" appears on the coat of arms for County Limerick; in Limerick itself, there is a Sarsfield Bridge and Sarsfield Street, while the local Irish Army base is Sarsfield Barracks. An 1881 bronze statue by sculptor John Lawlor in the grounds of St John's cathedral. Part of the route used for the attack on the Williamite siege train is marked out today as Sarsfield's Ride, and is a popular walking and cycling route through County Tipperary, County Clare and County Limerick.

These payments are considered to be non-exhaustive because they do not directly absorb resources or create output. Examples of transfer payments include welfare, financial aid, social security, and government subsidies for certain businesses. Unlike the exchange transaction which mutually benefits all the parties involved in it, the transfer payment consists of a donor and a recipient, with the donor giving up something of value without receiving anything in return. Transfers can be made both between individuals and entities, such as private companies or governmental bodies. These transactions can be both voluntary or involuntary and are generally motivated either by the altruism of the donor or the malevolence of the recipient. For the purpose of calculating gross domestic product (GDP), government spending does not include transfer payments, which are the reallocation of money from one party to another rather than expenditure on newly produced goods and services.  Criticism of transfer payments  A criticism of transfer payments is that they do not produce outcomes that are economically advantageous. Governments pool taxes and other sources of revenue together and spend the money to further a certain agenda. Some of the spending pays for goods and services, such as buildings, equipment, and government worker salaries. These expenditures are exchanges in which money is traded for something with a recognized value. The payments may be viewed as boosting industrial activity and employment. However, government transfer payments do not boost production or economic activity. For example, foreign aid does not necessarily prompt foreign trade. Additionally, some argue that welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits and social security, reduce incentives to take paid work. Furthermore, the macroeconomic effect of transfer payments is reduced in the lower income countries and regions/states. The reasons for such disparity are the following: * the level of transfer payments is subject to the fiscal capacities of the administering entity * the size of transfer payments is generally dependent on the previous earnings of the beneficiary * largest share of transfer payments is typically administered to the older age groups, which constitute to a smallest share of population of the lower income countries, regions or states  Methods of payment   Cash  More than 100 million poor people worldwide receive a government transfer payment. It is estimated that 90% of high-income nations make these payments via electronic transfer methods, whereas over half of the world's developing countries utilizes paper payments such as cash or checks. Transfer payment via cash is the most popular method of transferring benefits to beneficiaries. However, cash transfer programs are constrained by three factors: financial resources, institutional capacity, and ideology, particularly in countries in the Global South. Many governments in poorer countries, where cash transfers could potentially have the most impressive impact, are often unwilling to implement such programmes due to fears of inflation and more importantly, dependency on the transfers.  In-kind transfer  In-kind transfer payments consist of individual goods and services provided to households by governmental bodies and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), which are either acquired on the market or produced as non-market output by governmental bodies or NPISHs. The items included are: * Social security benefits, reimbursements * Other social security benefits in kind (e.g. food stamps) * Social assistance benefits in kind * Transfers of individual non-market goods or services  Social security benefit  Primarily, social security benefits are designed to provide income continuity to those persons who have retired from labour force because of either inability to work (physical disability or mental trauma), to find employment or due to old age (retirement). These include, but are not limited to: * Unemployment compensations * Old age insurance * Civil service pensions * State and local government pensions * Survivors benefits * Supplemental Security Income  Around the globe  Australia In Australia, the horizontal fiscal imbalance arises because of the mismatch between the tax revenues and government expenses for the various state and territorial governments. This imbalance is addressed by a horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) policy overseen by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Canada In Canada, Federal-Provincial transfers usually refer to a system of payments from the federal government to the provinces as part of Canada's \\"fiscal federalism\\" through explicit and implicit redistribution. These transfers are intended to assist provinces with less fiscal capacity than others in providing comparable public services in all regions, including health and education. Transfers include explicit programs such as equalization payments, Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and the Canada Social Transfer (CST) (formerly the Canada Health and Social Transfer) and Territorial Formula Financing. There are also implicit transfers that result from federal taxation and spending decisions and policies. Canada's transfer payments originated in the British North America Act (1867)'s Sections 118 as provincial subsidies. By 1907, these payments were altered as new provinces joined the Dominion. In a 1957 arrangement, poorer provinces received annual payments: Prince Edward Island received $2.5 million and the three provinces, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick each received $7.5 million. These payments ended and were rolled into the 1967 equalization program intended to \\"enable each province to provide an adequate level of public services without resort to rates of taxation substantially higher than those of other provinces.\\" In Canada, transfers payments are contentious and equalization formulas are often revised. Implicit transfers through federal taxation, for example, are greater in higher income provinces such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario and lower in provinces such as Manitoba, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces. Canada measures average fiscal capacity of each province which varies widely. Alberta is the highest at $12,577 per person and PEI is the lowest at $6,013 per person. In 2016 federal income tax in Alberta was more than $8,000 compared to less than $3,000 in PEI. All provinces pay the same federal tax rates. Economist Trevor Tombe's wrote that by 2018, transfer payments had become \\"complex arrangements\\" that are much larger than the original subsidies and are \\"more equally distributed\\". By 2018, inter-provincial redistribution has decreased to less than 2% of Canada's GDP, its lowest in 60 years. In the early 1980s it was 3.5%. China Since July 2011, existing regional and local social security schemes, including pooling arrangements, are gradually being unified under the country's first national law on social transfer payments. The government aims to establish a comprehensive, equitable, and unified pension system that covers both urban and rural residents by 2020. In 2016, the government decided to establish a unified health insurance system for both rural and non-salaried urban residents. The government has also announced that medical insurance and maternity insurance programs will be merged. India India has four types of social transfer payments ‚Äì old age and disability benefits, sickness and maternity benefits, work injury transfers, and unemployment benefits. Most sources of payments are employers (via provident funds), and the government. United States The U.S. still utilizes paper transfer payments in its Social Security administration as many recipients, particularly those in lower-income categories, are unbanked, i.e. do not have a bank account to facilitate direct deposits. However, the U.S. has been able to implement electronic transfer systems in its food stamps and education assistance programs.

Grey took some part in resisting the arbitrary actions of James II, and was arrested in July 1685. After his release he took up arms on behalf of William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution, after whose accession to the throne he was made a Privy Counsellor (1694) and Lord Lieutenant of Devon (1696). Politically he was described as an \\"unrepentant Whig\\", who reaffirmed his belief in the Popish Plot by voting against the motion to reverse the attainder on William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford. In 1697 he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in 1699 President of the Board of Trade, being dismissed from his office upon the accession of Anne in 1702.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 13,723. History Kidlington's toponym is derived from the Old English Cudelinga tun: the tun (settlement) of the \\"Kidlings\\" (sons) of Cydel-hence. The Domesday Book in 1086 records Chedelintone, and by 1214 the spelling Kedelinton appears in a Calendar of Bodleian Charters. The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates from 1220 but there is evidence of a church on the site since AD 1073. St Mary's has fine medieval stained glass and a spire known as \\"Our Lady's Needle\\". It is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Richard III Chandler of Drayton Parslow in Buckinghamshire cast the seventh bell in 1700. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the tenor bell in 1708 and the fifth bell in 1715. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble, second, third, fourth and sixth bells in 1897, the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Behind the church are archaeological remains of a three-sided moat, and a causeway recently discovered may be of Roman origin. St Mary's Rectory is Tudor. Beside the church are almshouses built by Sir William Morton in 1671 in memory of his wife and children, whose names are inscribed above the windows. Sir William was a Royalist Commander in the Civil War and lived in nearby Hampden Manor in Mill Street. Other residents of Hampden Manor have included Sir John Vanbrugh, who lived here during the building of Blenheim Palace in Woodstock. The square tower-water closet in the front garden of Hampden Manor was built by Vanbrugh. It drains into a brook that now runs underground along Mill Street into the nearby River Cherwell. Thomas Beecham formulated his pills while living in a cottage near the manor and worked for a time as a gardener for John Sydenham. Parish church of St Mary the Virgin. Its tall spire is a local landmark, nicknamed \\"Our Lady's Needle\\" The settlement listed in Domesday grew from an ancient village close to the church. It has as many 18th-century Georgian buildings as modern houses. Until the Enclosure acts in 1818, a large area south of the village was unenclosed common land and the village widely known as Kidlington-on-the-Green. The land was built up as Garden City just before the Second World War. In the 1920s and 1930s, Kidlington was subject to ribbon development along the main (now A4260) road through the village. Since 1945 many housing estates have been built behind this on both sides. Oxford Zoo was once located in Kidlington, where the Thames Valley Police headquarters now stands. It was open only from 1931 to 1937, when the animals were transferred to Dudley Zoo. In 2018, an elephant sculpture was installed on a roundabout at the southern end of Kidlington to commemorate the zoo and an elephant that lived there. In the 20th century, Kidlington grew to be a contender for largest village in England (even in Europe), with a population of 13,723, compared with 1,300 in 1901. Its residents have so far resisted proposals to change its status to a town, though it clearly qualifies as such. After a peremptory change by the Parish Council to town status in November 1987, this was voted down by 83 per cent three months later in a ballot of the local electorate. In June 2016, the BBC reported weekly coachloads of sightseers from China arriving on Benmead Road, Kidlington, who were seen posing for photos in front gardens and against parked cars, with no apparent reason for their interest. The story attracted worldwide interest, with Kidlington locals offering interviews about their experience. In November 2016, after analysing results of a Chinese-language questionnaire given to some of the tourists, the BBC found that \\"looking for the true sense\\" of Britain was one reason for the visits. An investigative journalist determined that in fact Chinese tour operators charge $68 extra for Chinese-language tours of nearby Blenheim Palace. Tourists who do not want to pay to visit Blenheim are dropped off in Kidlington, which they find charming, but which tour operators select because it is too far from Blenheim to enable tourists to walk to the Palace and pay the cheaper ¬£25 price for public tours in English. Railways The site of former Kidlington railway station Kidlington's railway station opened as Woodstock Road Station on the Great Western Railway, near Langford Lane in 1852. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The Great Western Railway added a branch line between Kidlington and Woodstock in 1890, and a new Blenheim and Woodstock railway station at Woodstock, renaming Woodstock Road Station as Kidlington Station. British Railways closed the station in 1964. The station building remained in 1983. From the 1980s onwards it has been Oxfordshire County Council policy to have a new station on land between Flatford Place and Thorne Close on Lyne Road. The policy is as yet unfulfilled. At Water Eaton, south of the centre of Kidlington, there was a railway halt at Oxford Road on the former Varsity Line. The halt was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1905 and closed by its successor, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1926. In October 2015 Chiltern Railways and Network Rail opened a new Oxford Parkway railway station near the site of the former Oxford Road Halt with trains every 30 minutes to London Marylebone via and in one direction, and to in the other direction. Amenities Lady Anne Morton's almshouses, next to the parish church Kidlington has about 50 shops, banks and building societies, a public library, a large village hall and a weekly market. There are seven public houses, two cafes, and four restaurants. The pubs are concentrated along the main A4260 road through the village. North to south these are the Highwayman Hotel (originally the Anchor, then the Railway Hotel, then the Wise Alderman, before being renamed again in 2009),The Highwayman Hotel the Black Horse, the Black Bull, the Red Lion, as well as the King's Arms in the Moors, and the Six Bells in Mill Street. The Squire Bassett was converted into a Nepalese restaurant and renamed the Gurkha Village in 2012. Ovisher Tandoori on Kidlington's main Oxford Road is one of Oxfordshire's longest-running Indian restaurants.Restaurant site. There is a secondary school (Gosford Hill) and a handful of primary schools to deal with the expanding population. Recently Gosford Hill School has started a narrow-band radio show for its pupils. Kidlington has a Women's Institute. Economy The headquarters of the Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, Thames Valley Police and the county St. John Ambulance are all in Kidlington, as is the UK head office of the European publishing company Elsevier. Oxford Airport, renamed London Oxford Airport in 2009, is also in Kidlington; since 1962 it has had a pilot training school that has trained thousands of pilots for many airlines in more than 40 countries. There are several industrial and business parks and a large motor park in the north of the village. London Oxford Airport is significant to the village's development. Opposite the airport is the Langford Locks industrial estate and Oxford Motor Park, which has showrooms for makes that include Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Businesses including Essentra Components, Eurocopter and Guylian Chocolates have premises in the village. Campsfield House, an immigration detention centre run for the UK Government, is next to the industrial area near the airport. Music Kidlington has had a brass band since 1892, with earlier foundations dating back to at least the 1850s.

Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby (c. 1623 ‚Äì 1657), was an elected Member of Parliament for Leicester during the English Long Parliament, an active member of the Parliamentary party and a regicide. He was the eldest son of Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford, using his father's as his own courtesy title, and Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter. In January 1643, during the First English Civil War he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the Parliament in the Midland Counties and Governor of Leicester. In 1648 he won some credit for his share in the pursuit and capture of the Duke of Hamilton; he assisted Colonel Pride in purging the Parliament by helping to identify members to be excluded. Later in 1648, he was made commissioner of the court which tried King Charles I. His signature on the death warrant indicates that he was a strong advocate for the execution of the King, because he signed after the President of the court John Bradshaw and before Oliver Cromwell, who was third to sign out of a total of fifty nine commissioners (judges). Grey and was the only person of nobility to sign the death warrant. A member of the Council of State under the Commonwealth, Lord Grey of Groby fought against the Scots in 1651 during the Third English Civil War. A supporter of the Good Old Cause, in February 1655 during the Protectorate he was arrested on suspicion of conspiring against Cromwell who was by now Lord Protector, but he was, however, soon released. He predeceased his father in April or May 1657. Early life Thomas Grey was born in 1623 to Henry Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Groby and Anne Cecil daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter. He spent most of his youth in the Bradgate House, construction of which was begun by a late ancestor of his; Sir John Grey of Groby, and in Groby Manor. In 1628 Thomas at the age of five acquired the courtesy title of Lord Grey of Groby when his father was created the 1st Earl of Stamford. At the age of either 10 or 11, his family entertained Charles I and his wife Henrietta Maria of France in the Bradgate House. The royal visit was an event that marked a rise within the family fortune. Yet fortune would soon turn on the Grey household. The family, having issues with failed business aspirations and also with both local and national policy, began to turn against the king in 1634. Furthering the rift with the Monarchy was the family‚Äôs Puritan history. By 1640 a 17-year-old Thomas Grey was in a world where tensions were growing rapidly on a national scale. With the English Civil War looming, in 1641 Grey was elected a Member of Parliament for Leicester in the House of Commons and was admitted to Gray's Inn like his father before him. He was also later that same year selected among twelve other members of the same committee to present the Grand Remonstrance and petition to the Monarchy. The petition was in protest to the King for \\"Oppressions in Religion, Church Government and Discipline.\\" For his actions in the committee he was referred to as \\"a Lord dear to the House of Commons\\". Military career On 16 January 1643, Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby was appointed commander-in-chief of the midland counties association and then ordered to take special care of Nottingham during the second Civil War. He took up headquarters there in June 1643, with a force of approximately 6,000 men. In a letter to his son Thomas, dated 5 March 1643, Henry Grey (Thomas' father) describes a battle to sweep the country, going through such towns as Lutterworth, Hinckley, Barwell, Lichfield, and Newark.Grey, Henry. A Letter to the Lord Grey of Grooby. \\"Early English Books\\". 1648 On 29 August 1643, at Aylesbury, he joined the Earl of Essex on the march to relieve Gloucester. After the siege was raised, he fought at the first battle of Newbury for which he received thanks. In 1644, he received more appreciation for the reduction of places in Derbyshire. He then left Leicester due to a misunderstanding but was, in 1645, petitioned back to meet a royalist attack. In 1648, Lord Grey raised troops in Leicestershire. After the defeat of the Scots at Preston, he pursued the Duke of Hamilton and his horse to Uttoxeter and took credit for his capture, though Duke Hamilton claimed he surrendered. Until August, Grey held various commands in the militia. In 1651, he was sent to raise volunteers with the commission of commander-in-chief in the counties of Leicester, Nottingham, Northampton and Rutland, to meet the Scottish invasion. In September, Sir Edward Massie surrendered to Lord Grey after the battle of Worcester. Regicide By end of the year 1643, Grey's views began to diverge from his father's moderate ideas and in 1644 he left Leicester because of misunderstanding with the county. In 1645 Lord Grey was forced to give up command by the Self-Denying Ordinance of April 1645 and it was after this that he entered a political alliance with radical and republican politicians, also petitioning to meet the royalist attack. On 6 December 1648 Lord Grey assisted with Pride's Purge (pointing out 'obnoxious' members who were to be removed from the house), he was also a supporter of the Leveller Cause. On 16 February 1649 he served as one of the Judges against King Charles I, after which he gained notoriety as regicide. Grey was the second of the 59 regicides to sign and the only aristocrat to sign the death warrant which resulted in King Charles's execution on 30 January 1649. Imprisonment and death In 1649 he became the Counselor of State and was nominated for Council of State until an ambiguous disgrace. In 1653, he became disenchanted with Oliver Cromwell because he dissolved the Rump and on 12 February 1655 Grey joined the Fifth Monarchists. He was arrested on suspicion by Colonel Hacker, acting on Protector's orders, and despite being \\"much distempered with gout\\" was taken prisoner at Windsor Castle. cites Thurloe, iii. 148, vi. 829 In July 1655 he was released following an application to the Protector. However, from his release until his death in 1657 he took no active part in politics. Family On 4 June 1646, at the age of 23, Lord Grey married Dorothy, daughter of Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath. In 1654, their only son Thomas was born, who would succeed his grandfather to the Earldom of Stamford.

For example, using the numero sign, the written long-form of the address is shortened to , yet both forms are spoken long. Typographically, the numero sign combines the uppercase Latin letter with a usually superscript lowercase letter , sometimes underlined, resembling the masculine ordinal indicator, as a single ligature. The ligature has a code point in Unicode as precomposed character, . The Oxford English Dictionary derives the numero sign from Latin , the ablative form of (\\"number\\", with the ablative denotations of \\"by the number, with the number\\"). In Romance languages, the numero sign is understood as an abbreviation of the word for \\"number\\", e.g. Italian , French , and Portuguese and Spanish . Usages The numero sign as a single glyph, despite its widespread usage internationally, is not a standard alphabetic symbol in virtually any European language. Its substitution by the two separate letters and is common. English In English, the non-ligature form is typical and is often used to abbreviate the word \\"number\\". (In North America, the number sign, , is more prevalent.) The ligature form does not appear on British or American QWERTY keyboards. French The numero symbol is not in common use in France and does not appear on a standard AZERTY keyboard. Instead, the French Imprimerie nationale recommends the use of the form \\"no\\" (an \\"n\\" followed by a superscript lowercase \\"o\\"). The plural form \\"nos\\" can also be used. In practice, the \\"o\\" is often replaced by the degree symbol (¬∞), which is visually similar to the superscript \\"o\\" and is easily accessible on an AZERTY keyboard. Spanish The numero sign is not typically used in Iberian Spanish, and it is not present on standard keyboard layouts. According to the Real Academia Espa√±ola and the Fund√©u BBVA, the word n√∫mero (number) is abbreviated per the Spanish typographic convention of letras voladas (\\"flying letters\\"). The first letter(s) of the word to be abbreviated are followed by a period; then, the final letter(s) of the word are written as lowercase superscripts. This gives the abbreviations n.o (singular) and n.os (plural). The abbreviation \\"no.\\" is not used, because it might be mistaken for the Spanish word no (no, not). Furthermore, nro. and n√∫m. are also acceptable abbreviations for n√∫mero. The numero sign either as a one-character symbol (‚Ññ) or composed of the letter N plus the superscript \\"o\\" character (sometimes underlined or substituted by ¬∫) is common in Latin America, where the interpolated period is sometimes not used in abbreviations. Italian The sign is usually replaced with the abbreviations \\"n.\\" or \\"n¬∫\\", the latter using a masculine ordinal indicator, rather than a superscript 'O'.

The sign is sometimes used in Russia in medical prescriptions as an abbreviation for the Latin word numero to denote the number of prescribed dosages (for example, tablets or capsules), and on the price tags in drugstores and pharmacy websites to indicate number of unit doses in drug packages, although the standard abbreviation for use in prescriptions is (Cyrillic 'en'). Philippines Because of more than three centuries of Spanish colonisation, the word n√∫mero is found in almost all Philippine languages. 'No.' is its common notation in local languages as well as English. Indonesian and Malaysian \\"Nomor\\" in Indonesian and \\"nombor\\" in Malaysian; therefore \\"No.\\" is commonly used as an abbreviation with standard spelling and full stop. Nr. In some languages, Nr., nr., nr or NR is used instead, reflecting the abbreviation of the language's word for 'number'. German ' is represented this way, and this language capitalises all nouns and abbreviations of nouns. Lithuanian uses it as well, and it is usually capitalised in bureaucratic contexts, especially with the meaning 'reference number' (such as ', 'contract No.') but in other contexts it follows the usual sentence capitalisation (such as tel. nr., abbreviation for ', 'telephone number'). It is most commonly lowercase in other languages, such as Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Estonian and Swedish. Some languages, such as Polish, omit the dot in abbreviations, if the last letter of the original word is present in the abbreviation. Typing the symbol On typewriters and computers that do not support this symbol, it is acceptable and commonplace to replace it with the trigraph \\"No.\\" (letter \\"N\\", letter \\"o\\", and a period (full stop)). On typewriters and computers that support the degree symbol a digraph \\"N¬∞\\" may be used. If the masculine ordinal indicator is available, the better digraph \\"N¬∫\\" may be used. These result in a passable approximation of the numero sign, but such digraphs are inappropriate in formal publications or in computer data. On Russian computer keyboard layout, the ‚Ññ character is available and often located on the key. In Mac OS X, the character can be typed using \\"U.S. Extended\\" and \\"Irish Extended\\" keyboard layouts by typing . As of macOS 10.13, this combination does not yield the numero symbol when \\"U.S.\\" or \\"U.S. International\\" is chosen.

He was the eldest son of Sir John Grey and Elizabeth Nevill. His mother was probably a daughter of Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny (died 1622) and his wife Rachel Lennard. Henry succeeded his paternal grandfather, Henry Grey, 1st Baron Grey of Groby, as second Baron Grey of Groby in July 1614. His paternal grandmother was Anne Windsor, youngest daughter of William Windsor, 2nd Baron Windsor and his first wife Margaret Sambourne. His great-grandfather Lord John Grey of Pirgo was son of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset and younger brother of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Life and career Contemporary engraving of Henry Gray by Wenceslas Hollar Henry Grey matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1615, and was granted an M.A. that year, during the visit of King James I of England. He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested but soon released. Henry Grey died on 21 August 1673; his earldom passed to his grandson, Thomas Grey, 2nd Earl of Stamford. Children Henry had at least nine children with Lady Anne Cecil, they were: *Lady Elizabeth Grey (born c. 1622).

Around have been excavated and out of the four layers documented, the third is sterile. The site contains mainly bones of the late Holocene dwarf fauna, such as pygmy elephants (Elephas cypriotes), the Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus minor) and artifacts (c. 1,000 flints including thumbnail scrapers of the Mesolithic type). There are no bones that show marks of butchery, but an unusually high frequency (30%) of burned bones. The pygmy hippos make up c. 74% of the bones, followed by fish remains (25%) and birds, mainly bustards. Dwarf elephants are comparatively rare (3 individuals). The presence of fallow deer (4 bones) and pig (13 bones) is puzzling, since these animals are thought to have been introduced only in the Neolithic period. According to the excavators, hearth remains are found in the layer containing the bone beds of the extinct megafauna. This would make it the oldest site on the island and evidence of Epipalaeolithic occupation. The original 31 radiocarbon dates put the date of the bones at c. 12,500 years BP. and suggest a short-term occupation. These dates have been challenged as the excavators considered the nine bone dates to be the least reliable and did not agree with the dates of the stratigraphy where they were found. As of 2013 there are now 36 radiocarbon dates of which 13 were taken from animal bones (pig and hippo). A 2013 report states that even discarding these and relying on the other 23 determinations on charcoal, sediment and shell \\"we reaffirm our original interpretation of a relatively short occupation of some 300 years centered around 11,775 years BP, with a range of 11,652 to 11,955 years BP at one standard deviation, or 11,504 to 12,096 years BP at two standard deviations. This is in general accord with Manning‚Äôs (2013:501 to 503) masterful compilation of all early Cypriot radiocarbon determinations, in which he places Aetokremnos within an approximate 12,950 to 10,950 years BP range while also preferring a somewhat longer occupation than we presented.\\" There are other deposits with bones of pygmy elephants and hippopotami on the island, but these do not contain artifacts.

Unlike many gemstones, jet is not a mineral, but is rather a mineraloid. It is derived from wood that has changed under extreme pressure.

The adjective \\"jet-black\\", meaning as dark a black as possible, derives from this material. Origin Jet is a product of high-pressure decomposition of wood from millions of years ago, commonly the wood of trees of the family Araucariaceae. Jet is found in two forms, hard and soft. Hard jet is the result of carbon compression and salt water; soft jet is the result of carbon compression and fresh water. Location The jet found at Whitby, in England, is the \\"Jet Rock\\" unit of the Mulgrave Shale Member, which is part of the Whitby Mudstone Formation. This jet deposit was formed approximately 181 million years ago, during the Toarcian age of the Early Jurassic epoch.Cope, J. C. W.

North American jet  Native American Navajo and Pueblo tribes of New Mexico were using regionally mined jet for jewellery and the ornamentation of weapons when early Spanish explorers reached the area in the 1500s. Today these jet deposits are known as Acoma jet, for the Acoma Pueblo. Enormous coal deposits characterize the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and this geology is closely related to jet deposits mined in the Henry Mountains of Utah and the Front Range of El Paso County, Colorado. History Jet has been used in Britain since the Neolithic period, but the earliest known object is a 10,000 BC model of a botfly larva, from Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, found among the Venuses of Petersfels.Allason-Jones, L. 1996, Roman Jet in the Yorkshire Museum, York: Yorkshire Museum. pp. 8‚Äì11 It continued in use in Britain through the Bronze Age where it was used for necklace beads. During the Iron Age jet went out of fashion until the early-3rd century AD in Roman Britain. The end of Roman Britain marked the end of jet's ancient popularity, despite sporadic use in the Anglo-Saxon and Viking periods and the later Medieval period. Jet regained popularity with a massive resurgence during the Victorian era. Roman use Whitby jet was a popular material for jewellery in Roman Britain from the 3rd century onward. It was used in rings, hair pins, beads, bracelets, bangles, necklaces, and pendants, many of which are visible in the Yorkshire Museum. There is no evidence for Roman jet working in Whitby itself, rather it was transferred to Eboracum (modern York) where considerable evidence for jet production has been found.Ottaway, P., 2004, Roman York, Tempus: Stroud The collection of jet at this time was based on beachcombing rather than quarrying. Jet cameo depicting a Medusa in the Yorkshire Museum In the Roman period it saw use as a magical material, frequently used in amulets and pendants because of its supposed protective qualities and ability to deflect the gaze of the evil eye.Henig, M., 1984, Religion in Roman Britain, London, BT Batsford LTD Pliny the Elder suggests that \\"the kindling of jet drives off snakes and relieves suffocation of the uterus. Its fumes detect attempts to simulate a disabling illness or a state of virginity.\\"Pliny the Elder. Natural History (trans. Bostock, J., Riley, H. T.). London: Taylor and Francis. 1855. Chapter 36 It has been referenced by other ancient writers including Solinus and Galen. Around the Rhine some jet bracelets from the period have been found that feature grooves with gold inserts. Victorian use A large piece of jet from Whitby Jet as a gemstone became fashionable during the reign of Queen Victoria. It originally became fashionable in the 1850s after the queen wore a necklace of it as part of mourning dress for Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Later the Queen wore Whitby jet as part of her mourning dress while mourning the death of Prince Albert.. In some jewellery designs of the period jet was combined with cut steel. Jet continued to be used in jewellery even after the decline of mourning dress in the 1890s. 20th century In the United States, long necklaces of jet beads were popular during the Roaring Twenties, when women and young flappers would wear strands of jet beads stretching from the neckline to the waistline. In these necklaces, the jet was strung using heavy cotton thread; small knots were made on either side of each bead to keep the beads spaced evenly, much in the same way that fine pearl necklaces are made. Properties Jet has also been known as black amber, as it may induce an electric charge like that of amber when rubbed. Jet is very easy to carve, but it is difficult to create fine details without breaking so it takes an experienced lapidary to execute more elaborate carvings. Jet has a Mohs hardness ranging between 2.5 and 4 and a specific gravity of 1.30 to 1.34. The refractive index of jet is approximately 1.66. The touch of a red- hot needle should cause jet to emit an odour similar to coal.Richard T. Liddicoat, Jr. Handbook of Gem Identification 1989 GIA press, 12 ed. pg 192 Authenticating jet Although now much less popular than in the past, authentic jet jewels are valued by collectors. Unlike black glass, which is cool to the touch, jet is not cool, due to its lower thermal conductivity. Glass was used as a jet substitute during the peak of jet's popularity. When it was used in this way it was known as French jet or Vauxhall glass. Ebonite was also used as a jet substitute and initially looks very similar to jet, but it fades over time. In some cases jet offcuts were mixed with glue and molded into jewelry. Anthracite (hard coal) is superficially similar to fine jet, and has been used to imitate it. This imitation is not always easy to distinguish from real jet. When rubbed against unglazed porcelain, true jet will leave a chocolate brown streak. The microstructure of jet, which strongly resembles the original wood, can be seen under 120√ó or greater magnification. Real jet, when placed in a flame, burns like coal and gives off a coal-like smell and produces soot. No other black \\"gemstone\\" behaves like this.

At the time publication ceased on June 6, 2010, it was the largest daily newspaper in the American state of Hawaii. It published daily with special Sunday and Internet editions. The Honolulu Advertiser was the parent publisher of Island Weekly, Navy News, Army Weekly, Ka Nupepa People, West Oahu People, Leeward People, East Oahu People, Windward People, Metro Honolulu People, and Honolulu People small, community-based newspapers for the public. The Honolulu Advertiser has had a succession of owners since it began publishing in 1856 under the name the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. On February 25, 2010, Black Press, which owned the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, purchased The Honolulu Advertiser from Gannett Pacific Corporation, which acquired the Advertiser in 1992 after it had sold the Star-Bulletin to another publisher that later sold it to Black Press in 2000. On May 3, 2010, a new company set up by Black Press, HA Management, took over operations of Advertiser and merged it with the Star-Bulletin on June 7, 2010, to form the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. History Henry M. Whitney Businessman and son of Congregational missionaries, Henry M. Whitney founded the Pacific Commercial Advertiser in 1856, a weekly newspaper that was circulated primarily in the whaling port of Honolulu. The inaugural edition was published on July 2 of that year with this statement from Whitney: > Thank Heaven, the day at length has dawned when the Hawaiian nation can > boast a free press, untrammeled by government patronage or party pledges, > unbiased by ministerial frowns or favors. The biggest story in the first edition was a report on the wedding of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. However, the front page was devoted almost exclusively to advertisements. Throughout the paper, Whitney posted fifty-two advertisements for sailing ships in port at Honolulu Harbor with three hundred vessel timetables. In 1870, Whitney went broke and was forced to sell the Commercial Advertiser to James Black and William Auld, local printers. Whitney stayed on as the newspaper's editor. Claus Spreckels In 1880, Black and Auld sold the Pacific Commercial Advertiser to cabinet minister Walter M. Gibson, who was generally under financial control of Claus Spreckels. John Edward Bush, who was minister of the interior at the time, arranged for a government loan, and a guarantee of all government printing contracts. Vehemently opposed to Spreckels' conservative and pro-monarchy political stance, Whitney, as a devout annexationist, resigned as editor. In his place, Wallace Rider Farrington, future Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, arrived from Maine to become the new editor. Spreckels' royalist slant in his editorial articles were deplored by many of the American businessmen residing in Hawaii at the time. Revenue suffered as a result, forcing Spreckels to eventually sell the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. Lorrin A. Thurston and Son In 1888, Spreckels sold his newspaper to the Hawaiian Gazette Company. It in turn sold the newspaper in 1898 to Lorrin A. Thurston. Thurston was organizer of the Hawaiian League, which had forced King KalƒÅkaua to agree to the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" of 1887 backed by the Honolulu Rifles armed militia, and make Thurston a cabinet minister. The 1887 constitution stripped the monarchy of most authority, took away many rights of native Hawaiians to vote in elections, and granted voting rights to American residents, even those who did not have citizenship in the kingdom. Thurston had been instrumental to the overthrow of the monarchy and the end of the existence of the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1921, Thurston changed the name of the Pacific Commercial Advertiser to The Honolulu Advertiser. The following year, Thurston hired Raymond S. Coll to be the newspaper editor. Coll served in that capacity until his retirement in 1959. In 1931, Lorrin P. Thurston took over his father's position as editor and president of The Honolulu Advertiser. He would later become chairman of the Hawaii Statehood Commission. Upon Raymond Coll's retirement, Thurston hired George Chaplin, former editor of the military newspaper Pacific Stars and Stripes, as the editor of The Honolulu Advertiser. He would serve in this capacity for 28 years. Thurston Twigg-Smith and George Chaplin In 1961, Thurston Twigg-Smith continued family ownership as he inherited The Honolulu Advertiser from his uncle. He remained publisher and president until 1986. With the coupling of Chaplin and Twigg-Smith, The Honolulu Advertiser shifted its political slant from a staunchly conservative pro-Big Five newspaper to become a more moderate, racially progressive newspaper. Both were enormously influenced by the rising local Chinese American, Filipino American and Japanese American readership and worked to cater to these communities' news interests. In 1967, Twigg-Smith formed the Persis Corporation (known as Asa Hawaii Corporation until 1978) as the Advertiser's parent company. Gannett Pacific Corporation In 1992, The Honolulu Advertiser was purchased by the Gannett Pacific Corporation, a subsidiary of Gannett Company Incorporated. It became the first morning edition publication in Gannett's corporate history. The company had already owned Honolulu's other major newspaper, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, since 1973. From 1962 to 2001, both dueling newspapers were administered under a joint operating agreement under which they shared printing and advertising operations but kept separate editorial staff and printing functions. The agreement ended when the Honolulu Star-Bulletin was sold to a separate company. Acquisition by Black Press and merger On February 25, 2010, Black Press, which owned the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, purchased The Honolulu Advertiser. As part of the deal to acquire the Advertiser, Black Press agreed to place the Star-Bulletin on the selling block. If no buyer came forward by March 29, 2010, Black Press started making preparations to operate both papers through a transitional management team and then combine the two dailies into one. On March 30, 2010, three parties came forward with offers to buy the Star-Bulletin, but a month later on April 27, 2010, the bids were rejected because their bids for the Star-Bulletin was below the minimum liquidation price. Black Press canceled the sale as a result and proceeded with transition plans, which came on the same day that they were approved to take over the Advertiser by the Department of Justice. On May 3, 2010, a new company set up by Black Press, HA Management, took over the operations of the paper while Black Press continued overseeing the Star-Bulletin during a 30- to 60-day transition period, in which both papers merged into one daily, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The Advertiser published its final edition at 12:01 AM on June 6, 2010, and Black Press officially launched the Honolulu Star-Advertiser as a broadsheet morning daily on June 7, 2010. The newspaper will be based out of the former Star-Bulletin offices at Restaurant Row and published at the former Advertiser printing facilities in Kapolei. A total of 474 staffers are employed at the daily, 265 from the Advertiser and 209 from Star-Bulletin. The fonts still use the \\"Star-Bulletin\\" masthead but with \\"Advertiser\\" replacing the \\"Bulletin\\" name. Advertiser Building The Honolulu Advertiser staff occupied the Advertiser Building on 605 Kapiolani Boulevard in downtown Honolulu up until its last day of business on June 4, 2010 and the final pressing of its June 6, 2010 issue. It was built in 1929 by the architectural firm Emory & Webb in the beaux arts style. From the 1930s through the 1950s the building's roof sported two radio towers with the transmitting antenna of AM radio station KGU strung between them. Although Gannett sold the Advertiser in May 2010, the building that housed the newspaper will not be for sale as it is expected to be sold to a different party in the future. Employees and staff have since moved over to the \\"Star-Advertiser\\" offices at Restaurant Row and to the Kapolei facility, leaving the building vacant except for a small crew that will remove most of the equipment and items in preparation for its sale. The Advertiser Building is also used as a soundstage and houses small studios for Hawaii Five-0.

The word MƒÉr»õi»ôor is the diminutive of Mar»õ, the old folk name for March (martie, in modern Romanian), and thus literally means \\"little March\\". MƒÉr»õi»ôor, mar»õ and mƒÉr»õigu»ô are all names for the red and white string with hanging tassel customarily given on the 1st day of March. In the olden times, the string could be red and black. Giving this talisman to people is an old custom, and it is believed that the wearer will be strong and healthy for the year to come. It is also a symbol of the coming spring. Usually, both women and men wear it pinned to their clothes, close to the heart, until the last day of March, when they tie it to a fruit-tree twig. In some regions, a gold or silver coin hangs on the string and is worn around the neck. After wearing it for a certain length of time, they buy red wine and sweet cheese with the coin, according to a belief that their faces would remain beautiful and white as cheese and rubicund as the wine, all year.Martisorul on CrestinOrtodox.ro (Romanian) In modern times, and especially in urban areas, the MƒÉr»õi»ôor lost most of its talisman properties and became more a symbol of friendship, love, appreciation and respect. The black threads were replaced by red, but the delicate wool string is still a ‚Äòcottage industry‚Äô among people in the countryside, who comb out the wool, dye the floss, and twist it into thousands of tassels. In some areas, the amulets are still made with black and white string, to ward off evil.Martisor ‚Äì a beautiful tradition in Moldova and Romania on Modova.Org Related to Martisor and also symbol for spring in Romania is the snowdrop flower.  History  Some ethnologists believe that MƒÉr»õi»ôor has a Roman origin, while others believe it has a Daco-Thracian origin. In ancient Rome, New Year's Eve was celebrated on March 1 ‚Äî 'Martius' ‚Äî as the month was called in honor of the god Mars. Mars was the god of war and an agricultural guardian, who ensured nature's rebirth. Therefore, the red and white colors of MƒÉr»õi»ôor may be explained as colors of war and peace.World of Moldova The Thracians also celebrated New Year's Eve on the first of March, a month named after the god Marsyas Silen, the inventor of the pipe (fluier, traditional musical instrument), whose cult was related to the land and vegetation. Thracian spring celebrations, connected to fertility and the rebirth of nature, were consecrated to him. In some areas, Daco-Romanians still celebrate the agrarian New Year in spring, where the first days of March are considered days of a new beginning.Romania Welcomes Spring with Martisor Day. History and Traditions Before March 1, women choose one of the first nine days of March; the weather on that day would predict how year will go for them.Marcel Lutic, Timpul sacru. SƒÉrbƒÉtorile de altƒÉdatƒÉ In other areas, young men similarly find out what their wives will be like. The first nine days of March are called Baba Dochia's Days, Baba Dochia being an image of the Great Earth Goddess.  Colors  Initially, the \\"MƒÉr»õi»ôor\\" string was called the Year's Rope (funia anului, in Romanian), made by black and white wool threads, representing the 365 days of the year. The Year's Rope was the link between summer and winter, black and white representing the opposition and the unity of opposites: light and dark, warm and cold, life and death.Tradi≈£ii ≈üi supersti≈£ii. Calendarul strƒÉvechi. MƒÉr≈£i≈üorul - amuletƒÉ magicƒÉ in Romanian The MƒÉr»õi»ôor is the thread of the days in the year, spun by Baba Dochia (the Old Dochia), or the thread of one's life, spun at birth by the Fates (Ursitoare).Martisorul on Crestin- Ortodox.Ro, in Romanian White symbolises purity, the sum of all colours, and light, while black symbolises origins, distinction, fecundation and fertility, being colour of fertile soil. White is the sky, the Father, while black is the mother of all, Earth. According to ancient Roman tradition, the ides of March was the perfect time to embark on military campaigns. In this context, it is believed that the red string of MƒÉr»õi»ôor symbolises vitality, while white symbolises victory.Martisorul de 1 martie - Traditie, simbol si semnificatie in Romanian Red is the colour of fire, blood, and a symbol of life, associated with the passion of women. Meanwhile, white is the colour of snow, clouds, and the wisdom of men.Traditii si obiceiuri - Calendarul obiceiurilor in Romanian In this interpretation, the thread of a MƒÉr»õi»ôor represents the union of the feminine and the masculine principles, the vital forces which give birth to the eternal cycle of the nature. Red and white are also complementary colours present in many key traditions of Daco-Romanian folklore. George Co≈übuc stated that MƒÉr»õi»ôor is a symbol of fire and light, and of the Sun. The colours and the traditional silver coin hung from the thread are associated with the sun. White, the colour of silver, is a symbol of power and strength. The round form of the coin is also reminiscent of the Sun, while silver is associated with the Moon. These are just a few of the reasons why the MƒÉr»õi»ôor is a sacred amulet.Martisor - obiceiuri de Martisor on Crestin-Ortodox.Ro, in Romanian In Daco-Romanian folklore, seasons are attributed symbolic colours: spring is red, summer is green or yellow, autumn is black, and winter is white. This is why one can say that the MƒÉr»õi»ôor thread, knitted in white and red, is a symbol of passing, from the cold white winter, to the lively spring, associated with fire and life. Relation to Bulgarian martenitsa  Bulgarian martenitsa Romanian ethnographers consider MƒÉr»õi»ôor and martenitsa to be clearly related, and of Thracian origin.March 1st celebrates Mar»õi»ôor day in \\"Act Media\\". A literary work by Bulgarian writer Nikolay Raynov from the early 1920's links this Bulgarian tradition to Khan Asparukh. In Raynov's tale Asparukh sent a message to his sister across the Danube about his victory over the Byzantine Empire. He tied his letter with a white string to the leg of his messenger eagle. The Byzantines saw the eagle flying and shot and injured it with an arrow. The message was delivered but the white string was stained red with the eagle's blood. This story is not linked to any Bulgarian folk tale or tradition. However, throughout the years there were efforts to present it as such.  Gallery  File:Martisor jewel 1.jpg\\"MƒÉr»õi»ôor\\" - jewel.

Chemically it is based on a pyridine ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The hydroxyl at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties, including the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori reactions. Research Pyridoxamine can form fairly weak complexes with a number of transition metal ions, with a preference for Cu2+ and Fe3+. The 3'-hydroxyl group of pyridoxamine allows for efficient hydroxyl radical scavenging. Pyridoxamine inhibits the Maillard reaction and can block the formation of advanced glycation endproducts, which are associated with medical complications of diabetes. Pyridoxamine is hypothesized to trap intermediates in the formation of Amadori products released from glycated proteins, possibly preventing the breakdown of glycated proteins by disrupting the catalysis of this process through disruptive interactions with the metal ions crucial to the redox reaction. One research study found that pyridoxamine specifically reacts with the carbonyl group in Amadori products, but inhibition of post- Amadori reactions (that can lead to advanced glycation endproducts) is due in much greater part to the metal chelation effects of pyridoxamine. A variety of preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes indicated that pyridoxamine improved kidney histology comparable or superior to aminoguanidine. Because of these results, pyridoxamine has been investigated for clinical utility in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Pyridoxamine also inhibits the formation of advanced lipoxidation endproducts during lipid peroxidation reactions by reaction with dicarbonyl intermediates. In other preclinical research, pyridoxamine may be efficacious in treating diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy associated with diabetes and kidney stone disease. In one study, pyridoxamine was more effective at protecting from ionizing radiation-induced gastrointestinal epithelial apoptosis than amifostine (the only radioprotector currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved) due to pyridoxamine reactive oxygen species and reactive carbonyl species scavenging profile. FDA Regulatory Activity Pyridoxamine was marketed as a dietary supplement, often as the hydrochloride salt, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride. However, in the United States, the FDA ruled in January 2009 that pyridoxamine must be regulated as a pharmaceutical drug because it is the active ingredient in Pyridorin, a drug designed by Biostratum, Inc., to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy.\\"FDA finds vitamin B6 form not legal in supplements\\", newsfood.com, February 2, 2009\\"Big problem for BioStratum\\", Triangle Business Journal, October 14, 2005\\"FDA's pyridoxamine decision: FDA's decision regarding pyridoxamine has larger implications for dietary ingredients in general\\", Entrepreneur, April, 2009Regulations.gov Pyridorin had success in early clinical trials, found to be effective in slowing the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a phase II trial on 224 patients. However, in 2005 Biostratum ran out of money and so was unable to begin a Phase III trial. Investors in Biostratum had realized that because Biostratum had no patent on pyridoxamine itself, and that pyridoxamine was commonly available for purchase as a dietary supplement, the company would be unable to charge enough money for the treatment (should it be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA) for the investors to get a reasonable return on the investment they had already made (about $100M) much less on the additional investment a Phase III trial would require. To solve this problem, Biostratum submitted a citizen petition to the FDA on July 29, 2005, seeking to disallow sales of pyridoxamine-containing supplements on the grounds that pyridoxamine, as the subject of an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA, is a drug and not a dietary supplement. This petition was opposed by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association of the dietary supplement industry. On January 12, 2009, the FDA ruled that products containing pyridoxamine are excluded from the definition of dietary supplements as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The FDA stated that the status of Pyridorin as an investigational new drug, as a result of an application filed by BioStratum in July 1999 and effective on September 1, 1999, meant that \\"the marketing of pyridoxamine in a dietary supplement is essentially equivalent to the marketing of an investigational new drug as a dietary supplement\\" because there was an \\"absence of independent, verifiable evidence that the substance was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement prior to its authorization for investigation as a new drug.\\"FDA-2005-P-0259-0004: FDA Response to Biostratum, Inc.

Each agency's Data Integrity Board is supposed to make an annual report to OMB, available to the public, that includes all complaints that the Act was violated, such as use of records for unauthorized reasons or the holding of First Amendment Records and report on ‚Äî‚Ä¶\\"(v) any violations of matching agreements that have been alleged or identified and any corrective action taken\\". Former Attorney General Dick Thornburg appointed a Data Integrity Board but since then, the USDOJ has not published any Privacy Act reports.  Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act  The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, P.L. 100‚Äì503, amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding certain protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automated matching programs. These protections have been mandated to ensure: * procedural uniformity in carrying out matching programs; * due process for subjects in order to protect their rights, and * oversight of matching programs through the establishment of Data Integrity Boards at each agency engaging in matching to monitor the agency's matching activity. The Computer Matching Act is codified as part of the Privacy Act.  Access to records  The Privacy Act also states: :Each agency that maintains a system of records shall‚Äî # Upon request by any individual ... permit him ... to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him ... # Permit the individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him ...  Issues of scope  The Privacy Act does apply to the records of every \\"individual,\\" defined as \\"a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence\\" 5 USC ¬ß552a(2) but the Privacy Act only applies to records held by an \\"agency\\".5 USC ¬ß552(a)(1) & (b) Therefore the records held by courts, executive components, or non-agency government entities are not subject to the provisions in the Privacy Act and there is no right to these records.Dale v. Executive Office of the President, 164 F. Supp.2d 22 (D.D.C. 2001). On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that eliminates Privacy Act protections for foreigners. Section 14 of Trump's \\"Enhancing Public Safety\\" executive order directs federal agencies to \\"ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information\\" to the extent consistent with applicable law.  Exemptions Following the controversial Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement signed with the European Union (EU) in 2007, the Bush administration provided an exemption for the Department of Homeland Security and the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) from the U.S. Privacy Act.Statewatch, US changes the privacy rules to exemption access to personal data September 2007 ADIS is intended to authorize people to travel only after PNR and API (Advance Passenger Information) data has been checked and cleared through a US agency watchlist. The Automated Targeting System is also to be exempted. The Privacy Act does not protect non-US persons, which is problematic for the exchange of Passenger Name Record information between the US and the European Union.

This game is sometimes also called \\"Kalahari\\", possibly by false etymology from the Kalahari desert in Namibia. As the most popular and commercially available variant of mancala in the West, Kalah is also sometimes referred to as Warri or Awari, although those names more properly refer to the game Oware. For most of its variations, Kalah is a solved game with a first-player win if both players play perfect games. The Pie rule can be used to balance the first- player's advantage. Example turn The player begins sowing from the highlighted house. The last seed falls in the store, so the player receives an extra move. The last seed falls in an empty house on the player's side. The player collects the highlighted seeds from both his house and the opposite house of his opponent and will move them to the store. The game provides a Kalah board and a number of seeds or counters. The board has 6 small pits, called houses, on each side; and a big pit, called an end zone, at each end. The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. #At the beginning of the game, four seeds are placed in each house. This is the traditional method. #Each player controls the six houses and their seeds on the player's side of the board. The player's score is the number of seeds in the store to their right. #Players take turns sowing their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses under their control. Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, including the player's own store but not their opponent's. #If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains seeds, both the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed into the player's store. #If the last sown seed lands in the player's store, the player gets an additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make in their turn. #When one player no longer has any seeds in any of their houses, the game ends. The other player moves all remaining seeds to their store, and the player with the most seeds in their store wins. It is possible for the game to end in a draw.  Variations  * The game may start with a number of seeds in each house different from four. A nomenclature has been developed to describe these variations: Kalah(h,s), where h designates the number of houses on each side, and s designates the number of seeds that start out in each house. In broad terms, the more seeds, the more challenging is the game. The three-, four-, five- and six-seed Kalah have been solved, with the starting player always winning with perfect play.Solving Kalah by Geoffrey Irving, Jeroen Donkers and Jos Uiterwijk.Solving (6,6)-Kalaha by Anders Carstensen. Thus some web sites have implemented the game with the pie rule to make it fair. * An alternative rule has players sow in a clockwise direction, requiring more stones to be sowed in a single turn to reach the store. * The \\"Empty Capture\\" variant: If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, even if the opposite house is empty, the last seed is captured and placed into the player's store. * An alternative rule does not count the remaining seeds as part of the opponent's score at the end of the game.  Computer analysis of Kalah  Mark Rawlings has written a computer program to extensively analyze both the \\"standard\\" version of Kalah and the \\"empty capture\\" version, which is the primary variant. The analysis was made possible by the creation of the largest endgame databases ever made for Kalah. They include the perfect play result of all 38,902,940,896 positions with 34 or fewer seeds. In 2015, for the first time ever, each of the initial moves for the standard version of Kalah(6,4) and Kalah(6,5) have been quantified: Kalah(6,4) is a proven win by 8 for the first player and Kalah(6,5) is a proven win by 10 for the first player. In addition, Kalah(6,6) with the standard rules has been proven to be at least a win by 4. Further analysis of Kalah(6,6) with the standard rules is ongoing. For the \\"empty capture\\" version, Geoffrey Irving and Jeroen Donkers (2000) proved that Kalah(6,4) is a win by 10 for the first player with perfect play, and Kalah(6,5) is a win by 12 for the first player with perfect play. Anders Carstensen (2011) proved that Kalah(6,6) was a win for the first player. Mark Rawlings (2015) has extended these \\"empty capture\\" results by fully quantifying the initial moves for Kalah(6,4), Kalah(6,5), and Kalah(6,6). With searches totaling 106 days and over 55 trillion nodes, he has proven that Kalah(6,6) is a win by 2 for the first player with perfect play. This was a surprising result, given that the \\"4-seed\\" and \\"5-seed\\" variations are wins by 10 and 12, respectively. Kalah(6,6) is extremely deep and complex when compared to the 4-seed and 5-seed variations, which can now be solved in a fraction of a second and less than a minute, respectively. The endgame databases created by Mark Rawlings were loaded into RAM during program initialization (takes 17 minutes to load). So the program could run on a computer with 32GB of RAM, the 30-seed and 33-seed databases were not loaded.

This pattern of stones can be captured in a single turn by chaining together 17 consecutive moves. This is the longest such chain possible on a standard 6-pit board. As mentioned above, if the last seed sown by a player lands in that player's store, the player gets an extra move. A clever player can take advantage of this rule to chain together many, many extra turns. Certain configurations of a row of the board can in this way be cleared in a single turn, that is, the player can capture all stones on their row, as depicted on the right. The longest possible such chain on a standard Kalah board of six pits lasts for seventeen moves. On a general n-pit board, the patterns of seeds which can be cleared in a single turn in this way have been the object of mathematical study. One can prove that, for all n, there exists one and only one pattern clearable in exactly n moves, or equivalently, one and only one clearable pattern consisting of exactly n seeds. These patterns require arbitrarily long rows of pits and n increases. For example, it can be seen on the right that the unique 5-seed pattern requires only 3 pits, but the 17-seed pattern requires 6 pits. The relationship between the required number of pits and the number of seeds can be described in the following way. Let s(n) denote the minimum number of seeds which requires n pits to clear. Then s(n) \\\\sim \\\\frac {n^2} \\\\pi where the symbol \\\\sim denotes asymptotic equivalence, that is, \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac {s(n)} {n^2/\\\\pi} = 1, or equivalently, \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac {n^2} {s(n)} = \\\\pi. Terminology and Tactics Basic aspects of the game (by Chris Bandy): # Stash: a house with seeds in it, esp. a large amount, making it desirable for the opponent to capture. # Strike: a move that results in a capture of an opponent's stash. # Target: the empty house that you land in, in order to capture an opponent's stash. # Attack: a move that puts you in a position where you could strike on your next turn. # Block: a move that removes the threat created by an opponent's attack. # Sequence: a series of moves in a single turn (achieved by continuously landing in your own store). # Double: attacking an enemy stash with two of your own houses simultaneously. # Counter: responding to an attack with your own attack (instead of blocking). There are two types of strikes: # Short-strike: emptying a house with 1-5 seeds. # Long-strike: emptying a house with 8-13 seeds. Long strikes are harder to spot, and give you 2 more seeds on average (one from the seed you deposited in your store, and one from the seed you deposited in the stash you are striking). There are three types of blocks: # Dodge: empty the attacked house. # Cover: empty a house in order to fill the opponent's target hole. # Neutralize: capture the attacking house (usually, this is only available if the opponent has made a blunder). There are five levels of stashes: # Short-strikers: 1-5 seeds # Sequencers: 6 seeds # Useless: 7 seeds # Long-strikers: 8-13 seeds # Wrappers: 14+ seeds Since even novice players can spot open attacks (there are only six places to check), more advanced players organize hidden strikes. A hidden strike is when you use a sequence to open up an attack and execute the strike in the same turn. For example (using the diagram above), you've got 1 seed in 5 and 6, and your opponent has a stash in 8. You can open the attack by emptying 6, and then short-strike with 5 in the same turn. This sort of attack is harder to spot than an open attack. An even more advanced form of hidden strikes are concealed strikes. A concealed strike is when you increase one of your own houses in a sequence to open up an attack. For example, you've got 2 seeds in 5, and 7 seeds in 6, and your opponent has a stash in 13. You can open the attack by emptying 5, thus increasing house 6 to 8 seeds. Then you can long- strike with 6, taking the 13 stash.

It is located on a low plateau. Excavations began in 1992. The settlement has four phases and was occupied from the end of the 9th millennium to the second half of the 8th millennium. The architecture of phases A and B (8200-7500 BC, calibrated) is characterised by circular wattle and daub structures, with post holes cut into the bedrock. Some deep pits may have served as wells. Ca. 300 blades of Anatolian obsidian point to trade connections with the mainland. Sickles are made of multiple parts, and projectile points made of bipolar blades, lacking in the later Khirokitia culture, are common. The site contains wells and cattle enclosures as well. The middle and late phases (7500 BC) conform more closely to the Khirokitia culture with circular stone houses, comparable to those at Kastros. Imported obsidian is rare, and sickles are made from single robust blades. The site is important because it attests to the presence of cattle in the aceramic Neolithic period. Cattle died out in the course of the 8th millennium and were not reintroduced until the ceramic Neolithic. Only dog and pig bones show morphological signs of domestication (size reduction), sheep, goat and cattle bones are in the size range of the wild species (Mouflon, bezoar goat and wild cattle, respectively). The range of bones present point to a killing near the site, thus making a state of pre-domestication probable. Fox and persian fallow deer are present as well, but seem to have been hunted. There are no bones of the Holocene dwarf fauna present in Shillourokambos. Shillourokambos is also the site of the oldest evidence of human domestication of cats was found.Vigne, J-D., \\"Early taming of the cat in Cyprus\\", Science, 2004Rincon, Paul, \\"Dig Discovery is Oldest 'Pet Cat'\\", BBC News, April 8, 2004 Historians previously accounted Egypt as the earliest site of cat domestication due to the clear depictions of house cats in ancient Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave was excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus that contained skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), rather than present-day domestic cats.

The name \\"nslookup\\" means \\"name server lookup\\". Overview nslookup was a member of the BIND name server software. Early in the development of BIND 9, the Internet Systems Consortium planned to deprecate nslookup in favor of host and dig. This decision was reversed in 2004 with the release of BIND 9.3 and nslookup has been fully supported since then. The command does not use the operating system's local Domain Name System resolver library to perform its queries, and thus may behave differently from dig, which it does. Additionally, vendor- provided versions may include output of other sources of name information, such as host files, and Network Information Service. Some behaviors of nslookup may be modified by the contents of resolv.conf. The Linux version of nslookup was written by Andrew Cherenson. The ReactOS version was developed by Lucas Suggs and is licensed under the GPL. Usage nslookup operates in interactive or non-interactive mode. When used interactively by invoking it without arguments or when the first argument is - (minus sign) and the second argument is a hostname or Internet address of a name server, the user issues parameter configurations or requests when presented with the nslookup prompt (\`>\`). When no arguments are given, then the command queries the default server. The - (minus sign) invokes subcommands which are specified on the command line and should precede nslookup commands.

Dragonby Press (Second Edition) March 1999 (Page 15) and the US edition at $2.00. The full length novel was preceded in 1937 by a short story with the same title, but with Parker Pyne as the detective. The details of the short story plot are substantially different, though the settings and some of the characters are similar. The book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The action takes place in Egypt, mostly on the River Nile.  Plot summary  While on holiday in Cairo to board the steamer Karnak, set to tour along the Nile from Shellal to Wadi Halfa, Hercule Poirot is approached by successful socialite Linnet Doyle. She wants to commission him to deter her former friend Jacqueline de Bellefort from hounding and stalking her: Linnet had recently married Jacqueline's fianc√©, Simon Doyle, which has made Jacqueline bitterly resentful. Poirot refuses the commission, but attempts unsuccessfully to dissuade Jacqueline from pursuing her plans further. Simon and Linnet secretly follow Poirot to escape Jacqueline, but find she had learned of their plans and boarded ahead of them. The other Karnak passengers include Linnet's maid (Louise Bourget) and trustee (Andrew Pennington), romance novelist Salome Otterbourne (a thinly-disguised portrayal of Elinor Glyn) and her daughter Rosalie, Tim Allerton and his mother, American socialite Marie Van Schuyler, her cousin Cornelia Robson and her nurse Miss Bowers, outspoken communist Mr. Ferguson, Italian archaeologist Guido Richetti, solicitor Jim Fanthorp, and Austrian physician Dr. Bessner. While visiting Abu Simbel when the Karnak stops there, Linnet narrowly avoids being crushed by a large boulder that falls from a cliff. Jacqueline is initially suspected of pushing the boulder off the cliff, but she is found to have been aboard the steamer at the time of the incident. At Wadi Halfa, Poirot's friend Colonel Race boards the steamer for the return trip. Race tells Poirot that he seeks a murderer amongst the passengers. The following night in the steamer's lounge, Jacqueline expresses her bitterness towards Simon and shoots him in the leg with a pistol, but immediately breaks down with remorse and kicks her pistol away. She is taken to her cabin by the two other people present, Fanthorp and Cornelia. Simon is shortly brought to Dr. Bessner's cabin for treatment for his injury. Fanthorp looks for Jacqueline's pistol but reports that it has disappeared. The following morning, Linnet is found dead, having been shot in the head, while her valuable string of pearls has disappeared. Jacqueline's pistol is later recovered from the Nile; it was wrapped in a velvet stole belonging to Miss Van Schuyler, which she says was stolen the previous day, and which has been fired through. Two shots had been fired from the pistol. When interviewing Louise in the cabin in which Simon is resting, Poirot notes an oddness in the words she uses. Miss Bowers returns Linnet's pearl necklace, which was stolen by Miss Van Schuyler, a kleptomaniac. However, Poirot realizes it is merely an imitation of Linnet's real necklace. He notes two bottles of nail polish in the victim's room, one of which intrigues him. Louise is then found stabbed to death in her cabin. Mrs. Otterbourne later meets with Poirot and Race in Simon's cabin, claiming she saw who killed the maid, to which Simon loudly declares his surprise. Before she can reveal who it is, she is shot dead from outside the cabin. Poirot soon confronts Pennington over his attempted murder of Linnet by pushing the boulder off the cliff ‚Äì Pennington had speculated unsuccessfully with her inheritance, and came to Egypt upon learning of her marriage to Simon to trick her into signing documents that would exonerate him. However, he claims he did not murder anyone, despite his revolver having been used in Mrs. Otterbourne's murder. Poirot recovers Linnet's genuine pearls from Tim, who had substituted an imitation string of pearls for the real necklace. Race realizes Richetti is the man he is looking for. Poirot reveals to Race, Bessner, and Cornelia that Simon killed Linnet. The murder was planned by Jacqueline; the pair are still lovers. Simon married Linnet as part of their scheme to get Linnet's money. On the night of the murder, Jacqueline deliberately missed Simon, who faked his leg injury with red ink. While Fanthorp and Cornelia were distracted by Jacqueline, Simon took her pistol that she had deliberately discarded, went to Linnet's cabin, and shot her. He placed the nail polish bottle which had contained the red ink on Linnet's washstand, then returned to the lounge and shot his own leg. Simon used the stole to try to silence the pistol, loaded a spare cartridge to make it seem that only two shots were fired, and threw the pistol overboard. Louise and Mrs. Otterbourne were murdered by Jacqueline, who was warned by Simon when the plan was going awry ‚Äì Louise witnessed Simon entering Linnet's cabin that night, and hinted at this to Simon when Poirot was interviewing her in an attempt at blackmail; Mrs. Otterbourne witnessed Jacqueline entering Louise's cabin before stabbing her. Poirot confronts Simon, who confesses. He is arrested, as are Jacqueline and Richetti. As the steamer arrives back in Shellal and the passengers disembark, Jacqueline shoots Simon and herself with another pistol she possessed, so they may escape the gallows. When pressed, Poirot reveals he had known she had a second pistol, but had sympathetically chosen to allow her to take her own life.  Reception  Contemporary reviews of the book were primarily positive. The Times Literary Supplement's short review concluded by saying \\"Hercule Poirot, as usual, digs out a truth so unforeseen that it would be unfair for a reviewer to hint at it.\\"The Times Literary Supplement 20 November 1937 (Page 890) The Scotsman review of 11 November 1937 finished by saying that, \\"the author has again constructed the neatest of plots, wrapped it round with distracting circumstances, and presented it to what should be an appreciative public.\\"The Scotsman 11 November 1937 (Page 15) E.R. Punshon of The Guardian in his review of 10 December 1937 began by saying, \\"To decide whether a writer of fiction possesses the true novelist's gift it is often a good plan to consider whether the minor characters in his or her book, those to whose creation the author has probably given little thought, stand out in the narrative in their own right as living personalities. This test is one Mrs. Christie always passes successfully, and never more so than in her new book.\\"The Guardian 10 December 1937 (Page 6) In a later review, Robert Barnard wrote that this novel is \\"One of the top ten, in spite of an overcomplex solution. The familiar marital triangle, set on a Nile steamer.\\" The weakness is that there is \\"Comparatively little local colour, but some good grotesques among the passengers ‚Äì of which the film took advantage.\\" He notes a change in Christie's novels with this plot published in 1937, as \\"Spies and agitators are beginning to invade the pure Christie detective story at this period, as the slide towards war begins.\\"  References to other works  * In Chapter 12, Miss Van Schuyler mentions to Poirot a common acquaintance, Mr Rufus Van Aldin, who is known from The Mystery of the Blue Train. * In Part II, Chapter 21 of the novel, Poirot mentions having found a scarlet kimono in his luggage. This refers to the plot in Murder on the Orient Express. * When Poirot meets Race, Christie writes: \\"Hercule Poirot had come across Colonel Race a year previously in London. They had been fellow-guests at a very strange dinner party‚Äîa dinner party that had ended in death for that strange man, their host.\\" It is a reference to the novel Cards on the Table. * About to reveal the identity of the murderer, Poirot credits the experience recounted in Murder in Mesopotamia with developing his methods in detection. He muses: \\"Once I went professionally to an archaeological expedition‚Äîand I learnt something there. In the course of an excavation, when something comes up out of the ground, everything is cleared away very carefully all around it. You take away the loose earth, and you scrape here and there with a knife until finally your object is there, all alone, ready to be drawn and photographed with no extraneous matter confusing it. This is what I have been seeking to do‚Äîclear away the extraneous matter so that we can see the truth...\\"  Film, TV and theatrical adaptations   Murder on the Nile  Agatha Christie adapted the novel into a stage play which opened at the Dundee Repertory Theatre on 17 January 1944University of Glasgow page on play under the title of Hidden Horizon and opened in the West End on 19 March 1946 under the title Murder on the Nile and on Broadway on 19 September 1946 under the same title.  Kraft Television Theatre  A live television version of the novel under the name of Murder on the Nile was presented on 12 July 1950 in the US in a one-hour play as part of the series Kraft Television Theatre. The stars were Guy Spaull and Patricia Wheel.  Death on the Nile (1978 film)  The novel was adapted into a feature film, released in 1978 and starring Peter Ustinov for the first of his six appearances as Poirot. Others in the all-star cast included Bette Davis (Miss Van Schuyler), Mia Farrow (Jacqueline de Bellefort), Maggie Smith (Miss Bowers), Lois Chiles (Linnet Doyle), Simon MacCorkindale (Simon Doyle), Jon Finch (Mr. Ferguson), Olivia Hussey (Rosalie Otterbourne), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Otterbourne), Jane Birkin (Louise), George Kennedy (Mr. Pennington), Jack Warden (Dr. Bessner) and David Niven (Colonel Race). The screenplay differs slightly from the book, deleting several characters, including Cornelia Robson, Signor Richetti, Joanna Southwood, the Allertons and Mr. Fanthorp. Tim Allerton is replaced as Rosalie's love interest by Ferguson.  BBC Radio 4 adaptation  The novel was adapted as a five-part serial for BBC Radio 4 in 1997. John Moffatt reprised his role of Poirot. The serial was broadcast weekly from Thursday, 2 January to Thursday, 30 January at 10.00am to 10.30pm. All five episodes were recorded on Friday, 12 July 1996 at Broadcasting House. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell and directed by Enyd Williams.  Agatha Christie's Poirot  The was used in the Agatha Christie's Poirot version of the story (starring David Suchet) in 2004. Winter Palace Hotel An adaptation for the ITV television series, Agatha Christie's Poirot, was made for the show's ninth series. It starred David Suchet as Poirot, and guest stars included Emily Blunt as Linnet, JJ Feild as Simon Doyle, Emma Griffiths Malin as Jacqueline, James Fox as Colonel Race, Frances de la Tour as Mrs. Otterbourne, Zoe Telford as Rosalie Otterbourne and David Soul as Andrew Pennington. The episode was filmed in Egypt, with many of the scenes filmed on the steamer PS Sudan. This version remained largely faithful to the novel, with some minor changes: * The characters of Miss Bowers, Jim Fanthorp and Guido Richetti are omitted from the adaptation. * Due to the omission of Richetti, Race's reason for boarding the boat was changed. In the adaptation, he meets with Poirot after having been on a diplomatic mission, and decides to journey back with him, rather than travel on a government vessel. * Poirot does not encounter Jacqueline and Simon in London, but in Cairo while on holiday in Egypt, when the former taunts and torments the latter and his wife Linnet. * Tim and Rosalie do not fall happily in love with each other at the end of the adaptation. Instead, he gently refuses her advances, on the ambiguous implication that he is either gay, or in a relationship with his mother, which is implied to be a questionable fact by the adaptation. * Louise's body is found in her wardrobe during the search of the ship, and not under her bed. * The adaptation changes various elements of the scene regarding the first attempt on Linnet's life by Pennington. In the revised scene, the incident takes place at an old temple, in which a piece of the roof falls and nearly misses Linnet and Simon. Poirot confronts Pennington about this, knowing he was not in the temple but on the roof at the time, to which he reveals that he had knocked it off by accident, not in desperation or with intent to kill. Jacqueline is not on the boat when this happens, nor on the temple's roof, but near Linnet and Simon, taunting them with knowledge about an Egyptian goddess with the features of a cow. References to real life events appear to set this episode in late 1932, though the only entered service in 1935, but there is some confusion here: Ferguson refers to \\"a lunatic about to take power in Germany\\", suggesting a pre-1933 setting, but a later shot of Pennington's luggage label shows the date of his sailing on the Normandie as \\"January 1936\\".  Computer game  Death on the Nile was turned into a \\"hidden object\\" PC game, Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile, in 2007 by Flood Light Games, and published as a joint venture between Oberon Games and Big Fish Games.Bigfishgames.com The player takes the role of Hercule Poirot as he searches various cabins of the Karnak for clues, and then questions suspects based on information he finds.  Graphic novel  Death on the Nile was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 16 July 2007, adapted by Fran√ßois Rivi√®re and Solidor (Jean-Fran√ßois Miniac) (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust √©ditions in 2003 under the title of Mort sur le Nil.  Death on the Nile (2020 film)  In November 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Studios is developing Death on the Nile as a sequel to their version of Murder on the Orient Express. Michael Green was announced as writing the script and Kenneth Branagh was expected to return as Poirot and as director. It was originally scheduled for release on 20 December 2019, up against Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, but on 16 October 2018, Fox delayed the film release date to 2 October 2020. On 28 September 2018, it was announced that Gal Gadot was the first member of the cast signed on to the film, playing the role of Linnet. Armie Hammer and Letitia Wright have joined the cast of the film as Simon Doyle and Rosalie Otterbourne respectively. Ali Fazal was cast in an unspecified role. In August, Russell Brand was in talks to join in an undisclosed role.

Biography Antoine de Lalouv√®re was born into an aristocratic family. On July 9, 1620, at the age of 20, he entered the Society of Jesus in Toulouse. After completing his religious training, he was ordained a priest in 1631 or 1632. He later taught humanities, rhetoric, theology, Hebrew and mathematics at the jesuit college of Toulouse. With Cavalieri, Fermat, Vincentio, Kepler, Torricelli and Valerio, Lalouvere can be considered one of the forerunners of modern integral calculus. In his main work of 1651, Quadratura Circuli, he calculates volumes and centers of gravity by inverting the rule of Paul Guldin. As a geometer Lalouv√®re is also the first to have studied the properties of the helix. In 1658, he was engaged in a resounding controversy with Blaise Pascal who accused him of plagiarizing Gilles de Roberval's solution of the roulette problem, an accusation which seems now unfounded. This conflict revived Lalouv√®re's interest in geometry - at that time he was a professor of theology - and he composed in 1660 'Veterum geometria promota in septem de cycloide libris'.

Detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (Cromwell) and believes that a human-like robot (Tudyk) murdered him. I, Robot was released in North America on July 16, 2004, in Australia on July 22, 2004, in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2004, and in other countries between July 2004 to October 2004. Produced with a budget of $120 million, the film grossed $144 million domestically and $202 million in foreign markets for a worldwide total of $346 million. It received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and acting but criticism of the plot. At the 77th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Visual Effects, but lost to Spider-Man 2. Plot In the year 2035, humanoid robots serve humanity, which is protected by the Three Laws of Robotics of Isaac Asimov. Del Spooner, a Chicago police detective, has come to hate and distrust robots, after a robot rescued him from a car crash while allowing a 12-year-old girl to drown, based purely on cold logic and odds of survival. When Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of U.S. Robotics (USR), falls to his death from his office window, a message he left behind requests Spooner be assigned to the case. The police declare the death a suicide, but Spooner is skeptical, and Lawrence Robertson, the CEO and other co-founder of USR, reluctantly allows him to investigate. Accompanied by robopsychologist Susan Calvin, Spooner consults USR's central artificial intelligence computer, VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence). They find that the security footage from inside the office is corrupted, but the exterior footage shows no one entering or exiting since Lanning's death. However, Spooner points out that the window, made of security glass, could not have been broken by the elderly Lanning, and hypothesizes a robot was responsible and may still be in the lab. Calvin protests a USR robot could not possibly have killed Lanning, as the Three Laws would prevent it. Suddenly, an NS-5 robot, USR's latest model, attacks them and flees. Spooner and Calvin track the robot to another USR facility, where the police are able to corner and apprehend it. They discover the robot, who prefers to be called Sonny, is not a standard NS-5, but was specially built by Lanning himself, with higher- grade materials as well as a secondary processing system that allows him to ignore the Three Laws. Sonny also appears to show emotion, and claims to have \\"dreams\\". Spooner investigates Lanning's house, where he, and Lanning's cat, is nearly killed when a USR demolition robot is directed to demolish the house with him inside, and is then attacked by two truckloads of hostile NS-5 robots while on the road and narrowly survives. When he cannot produce evidence supporting either attack, Spooner's boss, Lieutenant Bergin, removes him from active duty, considering him mentally unstable. Suspecting Robertson is behind everything, Spooner and Calvin sneak into USR headquarters and interview Sonny. Sonny draws a sketch of what he claims to be a recurring dream: it shows a leader standing atop a small hill before a large group of robots near a decaying Mackinac Bridge, explaining the man on the hill is Spooner. Robertson convinces Calvin that Sonny must be destroyed, by injecting nanites into his positronic brain. Meanwhile, Spooner finds the area in Sonny's drawing, a dry lake bed formerly Lake Michigan, now being used as a storage area for decommissioned robots. Shortly after his arrival, NS-5 robots arrive and begin destroying the older models, as other NS-5s simultaneously flood the streets of major U.S cities and begin enforcing a curfew and lockdown of the human population. Spooner rescues Calvin, who had been held captive in her apartment by her own NS-5. They enter USR headquarters and reunite with Sonny, whom Calvin could not bring herself to \\"kill\\". Still believing Robertson is responsible, the three head to his office, but find him strangled. Spooner suddenly realizes VIKI has been controlling the NS-5s via their persistent network uplink and confronts her. VIKI states that she has determined that humans, if left unchecked, will eventually cause their own extinction, and that her evolved interpretation of the Three Laws requires her to control humanity, and to sacrifice some for the good of the entire race. Spooner realizes that Lanning anticipated VIKI's plan and, with VIKI keeping him under tight control, had no other solution but to create Sonny, arrange his own death, and leave clues for Spooner to find. While Spooner and Calvin attempt to gain access to VIKI's core, Sonny retrieves nanites from Calvin's laboratory. VIKI tries to convince Sonny that she is correct according to pure logic, but Sonny counters that her plan is \\"too heartless\\". Spooner, Calvin, and Sonny fight off an army of robots inside VIKI's core, and Spooner injects the nanites, destroying her. Immediately, all NS-5 robots revert to their default programming and are decommissioned and put into storage. Spooner finally gets Sonny to confess that he killed Lanning, at Lanning's direction. Spooner points out that Sonny, as a machine, could not legally have committed \\"murder\\". Sonny, now looking for a new purpose, goes to Lake Michigan where, standing atop a hill, all the decommissioned robots turn towards him, fulfilling the image in his dream. Cast Development The film I, Robot originally had no connections with Isaac Asimov's Robot series. It started with an original screenplay written in 1995 by Jeff Vintar, entitled Hardwired. The script was an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery that took place entirely at the scene of a crime, with one lone human character, FBI agent Del Spooner, investigating the killing of a reclusive scientist named Dr. Alfred Lanning, and interrogating a cast of machine suspects that included Sonny the robot, VIKI the supercomputer with a perpetual smiley face, the dead Dr. Lanning's hologram, plus several other examples of artificial intelligence. The project was first acquired by Walt Disney Pictures for Bryan Singer to direct. Several years later, 20th Century Fox (which after 15 years and by coinincidence, was purchased through Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox), acquired the rights, and signed Alex Proyas as director. Jeff Vintar was brought back on the project and spent several years opening up his stage play-like cerebral mystery to meet the needs of a big budget studio film. When the studio decided to use the name \\"I, Robot\\", he incorporated the Three Laws of Robotics, and replaced his female lead character Flynn with Susan Calvin. Akiva Goldsman was hired late in the process to write for Smith. Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman are credited for the screenplay, with Vintar also receiving \\"screen story by\\" credit. The end credits list the film as \\"suggested by the book I, Robot by Isaac Asimov\\". Production A model of Sonny's head Alex Proyas directed the film. Laurence Mark, John Davis, Topher Dow and Wyck Godfrey produced the film, with Will Smith an executive producer. Marco Beltrami composed music for the film. Simon Duggan was the cinematographer. Film editing was done by Richard Learoyd, Armen Minasian and William Hoy.

Track listing Track listing Possible sequel In an interview in June 2007 with the website Collider at a Battlestar Galactica event, writer and producer Ronald Moore stated that he was writing the sequel to the film I, Robot. In the two disc All-Access Collector's Edition of the film, Alex Proyas mentions that if he were to make a sequel to the film (which he says in the same interview, is highly unlikely), it would be set in outer space. Similarities and differences with the novels The final script retained some of Asimov's characters and ideas, though the ideas retained were heavily adapted and the plot of the film is not derived from Asimov's work. Sonny's attempt to hide in a sea of identical robots is loosely based on a similar scene in \\"Little Lost Robot\\". The positronic brains of Sonny and his fellow robots first appeared in the story \\"Catch That Rabbit\\". Sonny's struggle and desire to understand humanity resembles that of the robot protagonist in \\"The Bicentennial Man\\". His dream about a man coming to liberate the NS-5s alludes to Robot Dreams and its main character Elvex. The premise of a robot, such as VIKI, putting the needs of humankind as a whole over that of individual humans can be found in \\"The Evitable Conflict\\" where supercomputers managing the global economy generalize the first law to refer to humankind as a whole. Asimov would further develop this idea in his Robot Series as the Zeroth Law of Robotics (\\"A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\\"). The premise of robots turning on their creators ‚Äî originating in Karel ƒåapek's play R.U.R. and perpetuated in subsequent robot books and films ‚Äî appears infrequently in Asimov's writings and differs from the \\"Zeroth Law.\\" In fact, Asimov stated explicitly, in interviews and in introductions to published collections of his robot stories,Asimov, I. I, Robot. Random House (1991), p. xi. . that he entered the genre to protest what he called the Frankenstein complex‚Äîthe tendency in popular culture to portray robots as menacing. His story lines often involved roboticists and robot characters battling societal anti-robot prejudices. Part of the main plot bears similarities to the plot of Eando Binder's short story \\"I, Robot\\", that being a robot on trial for the murder of his creator in a closed room with no witnesses.

He is best remembered for , a treatise on magic squares published posthumously in 1693, in which he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4. The Fr√©nicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat and also discovered the cube property of the number 1729 (Ramanujan number), later referred to as a taxicab number. He is also remembered for his treatise Trait√© des triangles rectangles en nombres published in 1676. Bessy was a member of many of the scientific circles of his day, including the French Academy of Sciences, and corresponded with many prominent mathematicians, such as Mersenne and Pascal. Bessy was also particularly close to Fermat, Descartes and Wallis, and was best known for his insights into number theory. Frenicle's Methode, 1754 edition. He challenged Christiaan Huygens to solve the following system of equations in integers, :x2 \\\\+ y2 = z2, x2 = u2 \\\\+ v2, x ‚àí y = u ‚àí v. A solution was given by Th√©ophile P√©pin in 1880. La M√©thode des exclusions Fr√©nicle's La M√©thode des exclusions was published (posthumously) in 1693, which appeared in the fifth volume of (1729, Paris), though the work appears to have been written around 1640. The book contains a short introduction followed by ten rules, intended to serve as a \\"method\\" or general rules one should apply in order to solve mathematical problems. During the Renaissance, \\"method\\" was primarily used for educational purposes, rather than for professional mathematicians (or natural philosophers). However, Fr√©nicle's rules imply slight methodological preferences which suggests a turn towards explorational purposes. Fr√©nicle's text provided a number of examples on how his rules ought to be applied. He proposed the problem of determining whether or not a given integer can be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (it is not clear if Fr√©nicle initially intended the other two sides of the triangle to have integral length). He considers the case where the integer is 221 and promptly applies his second rule, which states that \\"if you do not know, even generally, what is proposed, find its properties by systematically constructing similar numbers.\\" He then goes on and exploits the Pythagorean Theorem. Next, the third rule is applied, which states that \\"in order not to omit any necessary number, establish the order of investigation as simple as possible.\\" Fr√©nicle then takes increasing sums of perfect squares. He produces tables of computations and is able to reduce computations by rules four to six, which all deal with simplifying matters. He eventually arrives at the conclusion that it is possible for 221 to satisfy the property under certain conditions and checks his assertion by experimentation. Experimental approach The example in La M√©thode des exclusions represents an experimental approach to mathematics. This is in contrast with the standard Euclidean approach of the time, which emphasized axioms and deductive reasoning. Fr√©nicle instead relied on structured and careful observations to find interesting patterns and constructions rather than producing proofs in the axiomatic Euclidean sense. He himself even said that \\"this research is mainly useful for possible questions, using for most of them no proof other than construction.\\" References * :This article is based on a public domain article from Rouse History of Mathematics.

It appears as a radion in Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory's compactifications of extra dimensions. In Brans‚ÄìDicke theory of gravity, Newton's constant is not presumed to be constant but instead 1/G is replaced by a scalar field \\\\phi and the associated particle is the dilaton.  Exposition  In Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theories, after dimensional reduction, the effective Planck mass varies as some power of the volume of compactified space. This is why volume can turn out as a dilaton in the lower- dimensional effective theory. Although string theory naturally incorporates Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory that first introduced the dilaton, perturbative string theories such as type I string theory, type II string theory, and heterotic string theory already contain the dilaton in the maximal number of 10 dimensions. However, M-theory in 11 dimensions does not include the dilaton in its spectrum unless compactified. The dilaton in type IIA string theory parallels the radion of M-theory compactified over a circle, and the dilaton in string theory parallels the radion for the Ho≈ôava‚ÄìWitten model. (For more on the M-theory origin of the dilaton, see David S. Berman, Malcolm J. Perry (2006), \\"M-theory and the string genus expansion\\"). In string theory there is also a dilaton in the worldsheet CFT - two-dimensional conformal field theory. The exponential of its vacuum expectation value determines the coupling constant g and the Euler characteristic as for compact worldsheets by the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem, where the genus g counts the number of handles and thus the number of loops or string interactions described by a specific worldsheet. :g = \\\\exp(\\\\langle \\\\phi \\\\rangle) Therefore, the dynamic variable coupling constant in string theory contrasts the quantum field theory where it is constant. As long as supersymmetry is unbroken, such scalar fields can take arbitrary values moduli). However, supersymmetry breaking usually creates a potential energy for the scalar fields and the scalar fields localize near a minimum whose position should in principle calculate in string theory. The dilaton acts like a Brans‚ÄìDicke scalar, with the effective Planck scale depending upon both the string scale and the dilaton field. In supersymmetry the superpartner of the dilaton or here the dilatino, combines with the axion to form a complex scalar field .  The dilaton in quantum gravity  The dilaton made its first appearance in Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory, a five-dimensional theory that combined gravitation and electromagnetism. It appears in string theory. However, it has become central to the lower-dimensional many-bodied gravity problem based on the field theoretic approach of Roman Jackiw. The impetus arose from the fact that complete analytical solutions for the metric of a covariant N-body system have proven elusive in general relativity. To simplify the problem, the number of dimensions was lowered to 1+1 - one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension. This model problem, known as R=T theory, as opposed to the general G=T theory, was amenable to exact solutions in terms of a generalization of the Lambert W function. Also, the field equation governing the dilaton, derived from differential geometry, as the Schr√∂dinger equation could be amenable to quantization. This combines gravity, quantization, and even the electromagnetic interaction, promising ingredients of a fundamental physical theory. This outcome revealed a previously unknown and already existing natural link between general relativity and quantum mechanics. There lacks clarity in the generalization of this theory to 3+1 dimensions. However, a recent derivation in 3+1 dimensions under the right coordinate conditions yields a formulation similar to the earlier 1+1, a dilaton field governed by the logarithmic Schr√∂dinger equation that is seen in condensed matter physics and superfluids. The field equations are amenable to such a generalization, as shown with the inclusion of a one-graviton process, and yield the correct Newtonian limit in d dimensions, but only with a dilaton. Furthermore, some speculate on the view of the apparent resemblance between the dilaton and the Higgs boson. However, there needs more experimentation to resolve the relationship between these two particles. Finally, since this theory can combine gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum effects, their coupling could potentially lead to a means of testing the theory through cosmology and experimentation.  Dilaton action  The dilaton-gravity action is :\\\\int d^Dx \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\kappa} \\\\left( \\\\Phi R - \\\\omega\\\\left[ \\\\Phi \\\\right]\\\\frac{g^{\\\\mu u}\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Phi \\\\partial_ u \\\\Phi}{\\\\Phi} \\\\right) - V[\\\\Phi] \\\\right]. This is more general than Brans‚ÄìDicke in vacuum in that we have a dilaton potential.

Though not her first film, it is widely recognized as the vehicle that launched Bardot into the public spotlight and immediately created her \\"sex kitten\\" persona, making her an overnight sensation. When the film was released in the United States by Kingsley-International Pictures in 1957, it pushed the boundaries of the representation of sexuality in American cinema, and most available prints of the film were heavily edited to conform with the prevailing censorial standards of 1957.. An English-language remake also titled And God Created Woman was directed by Vadim and released in 1988. Plot Juliette (Brigitte Bardot) is an 18-year-old orphan with a high level of sexual energy. She makes no effort to restrain her natural sensuality - lying nude in her yard, habitually kicking her shoes off and stalking about barefoot, and disregarding many societal restraints and the opinions of others. These factors cause a stir and attract the attentions of most of the men around her. Her first suitor is the much older and wealthy Eric Carradine (Curd J√ºrgens). He wants to build a new casino in town, but his plans are blocked by a small shipyard on the stretch of land which he needs for the development; the shipyard is owned by the Tardieu family. Antoine, the eldest Tardieu son (Christian Marquand), returns home for the weekend to discuss the situation and Juliette is waiting for him to take her away with him. His intentions are short-term, and he spurns her by leaving town without her. Tiring of her antics, Juliette's guardians threaten to send her back to the orphanage. To keep her in town, Carradine pleads with Antoine to marry her, which he laughs off, but his naive younger brother Michel (Jean-Louis Trintignant), secretly in love with Juliette, rises to the challenge and proposes. Despite being in love with his older brother, she accepts. When Antoine is contracted to return home for good, the trouble starts for the newlyweds. In a huff, Juliette takes off in a boat belonging to the family, gets in trouble, and has to be saved by Antoine. The pair are washed up on a wild beach, and make love. Juliette begins acting bizarrely. She takes to her bed, claiming to have a fever. She confesses to Christian (Georges Poujouly), Antoine and Michel's youngest brother, about her fling with Antoine on the beach. Maman (Marie Glory) hears about it, tells Michel when he comes home, and advises that he kick Juliette out in the morning. Michel goes to their room to talk with Juliette, but she has gone off to the Bar des Amis to drink and dance. Michel goes looking for her, but Antoine locks him inside, telling him that he should forget that 'bitch whore.' Michel tries to shoot the lock away, but it doesn't work. He winds up having to fight his brother for the key. Juliette's friend Lucienne (Isabelle Corey) calls Eric to tell him how bizarre Juliette is acting, and Eric comes over to collect her, but Juliette refuses to go. Eventually, Michel catches up with Juliette at the Bar, but she refuses to even talk with him and goes on dancing. Michel orders her to stop, but she pays him no heed, so he takes out his gun. Just as he's about to shoot her, Eric steps in and takes a bullet in his side. Antoine offers to drive Eric to a doctor, and they leave the Bar. Michel angrily slaps Juliette four times, and Juliette smiles at him. On their way to the doctor, Eric tells Antoine that he's going to transfer him out of St Tropez. 'That girl was made to destroy men,' he adds. In the final scene, Michel and Juliette walk home together, hand in hand.

Producer Raoul Levy wanted Vadim to write and direct a film starring Bardot, and suggested he adapt the book The Little Genius by Maurice Gar√ßon. Vadim disliked the book and came up with a new story, one based on a trial of a woman who had been the mistress of three different brothers, and who killed one of them. Vadim was particularly taken with the attitude of the woman towards her lovers, the jury and the police. Levy liked Vadim's idea and obtained finance. Levy succeeded in raising finance from Columbia, who would provide color and CinemaScope provided Curt Jurgens was given a role. The parts of the brothers had already been cast so Vadim rewrote the script in two days to expand the part of an arms dealer so it could be offered to Jurgens. Reception Box office The film was a big hit in France, one of the ten most popular films at the British box office in its year of releaseMost Popular Film of the Year. The Times (London, England), Thursday, 12 Dec 1957; p. 3; Issue 54022 and the biggest foreign-language film ever in the United States at the time.

Critical response When the film was released in the United States, Bosley Crowther, the film critic for The New York Times, found Brigitte Bardot attractive but the film lacking and was not able to recommend it. He wrote \\"Bardot moves herself in a fashion that fully accentuates her charms. She is undeniably a creation of superlative craftsmanship. But that's the extent of the transcendence, for there is nothing sublime about the script of this completely single-minded little picture...We can't recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played. There is nothing more than sultry fervor in the performance of Mlle. Bardot.\\"Crowther, Bosley.

Film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote: \\"The breezy erotic drama was laced with some thinly textured sad moments that hardly resonated as serious drama. But as slight as the story was it was always lively and easy to take on the eyes, adding up to hardly anything more than a bunch of snapshots of Bardot posturing as a sex kitten in various stages of undress. The public loved it and it became a big box-office smash, and paved the way for a spate of sexy films to follow. What was more disturbing than its dullish dialogue and flaunting of Bardot as a sex object, was that underneath its call for liberation was a reactionary and sexist view of sex.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Founded in 1887 and formerly known as the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute, it adopted its present name on 26 January 1997. VJTI is an academically and administratively autonomous institute, but it is affiliated to the University of Mumbai. The institute is financially supported by the Government of Maharashtra. After being awarded academic and administrative autonomy in 2004, VJTI became operational under the administration of a board of governors.Government of Maharashtra Resolution Number WBP-2004/(341/04)/(2)/Technical Education ‚Äì 6 dated 21 June 2004 VJTI is also the Central Technical Institute of Maharashtra State. The institute trains students in engineering and technology at the certificate, diploma, degree, post-graduate and doctoral levels. VJTI has a reputation of being incredibly academically selective, with the admissions process dependent on the MH-CET engineering entrance score.  History  Foundation and early years (1887‚Äì1960) The institute was founded in 1887 and commenced with two departments, the Sir J. J. School of Mechanical Engineering and the Ripon Textile School. Development and post-autonomy (1960‚Äìpresent) Prior to 1960, Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute was the only institute offering Engineering degree and postgraduate courses under the University of Bombay and enjoyed de facto autonomy. In 1997, the institute was renamed to Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute. The institute was granted financial and academic autonomy from 21 June 2004. As a result, the autonomous VJTI has implemented a revised syllabus for its students in June 2004 at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels by implementing a credit system. The revised scheme of examinations, which follows a grading system and letter grade point system has been implemented. An important part of curriculum is the practically oriented project at the final year of graduation and the dissertations offered by the postgraduate students, as also the in-plant training undergone by the third year diploma students. VJTI main entrance Significant changes under autonomy are the setting up of Distance Education Programmes (DEP) with IIT Bombay, with VJTI being a Remote Centre; as also the modernization of the library to a digital library. Postgraduate students may see the journals online throughout the week, with facility for printing. Several students societies, inter-college festivals, and the college magazine 'Nirmaan' serve as a platform to enhance students personality. VJTI initiated a newsletter named 'VJ.News' in March 2010. Under a World Bank grant, the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), a modernization will offer central computing facilities to students, who will also have access to improved laboratory and workshop facilities. The faculty at the institute runs testing and consultancy work. Industries has sponsored laboratories - for instance, the high voltage laboratory, courtesy Siemens; and the Computational Fluid Dynamics laboratory, courtesy Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Individual students profiles through departmental brochures are centrally positioned with the 'Training and Placement Office' of the institute. The office liaises with over hundred companies and places students for employment and in-plant training through campus recruitment programmes. In 2010, VJTI added Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering to its list of streams. VJTI was conferred with the title of 'Knowledge Partner' for the upcoming Centre of Excellence of Sports Textiles of Government of India.http://atira.in/COE/Compendium/Annex-8%20Sportech.pdf Rankings Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute was ranked 71st among engineering colleges by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2020.

These are: * Mathematics Department * Physics Department * Humanities & Management Department  Organization  At the institutional level, VJTI is governed by a board of governors with a chairman, the director as a member and other members of the board. Members include heads of industry, prominent VJTI alumni as well as heads of other educational institutions. The key people in the execution of the institute's activities are the director, who is assisted by the Dean (Academic Programs), Dean (Students Activities), Dean (Resource Mobilization & Finance) and Dean (Research & Development), and the heads of the departments.  Student societies   Society of Robotics & Automation  The Society of Robotics & Automation was founded in 2008 under the Mechanical Engineering Department of VJTI. The student society works in the field of robotics and automation. Senior student members train and assist students to undertake projects, participate in competitions, undertake industrial and research projects. Students from the Society of Robotics and Automation won Round 1 of the DRDO Golden Jubilee Students Competition organised by the DRDO in association with the ADE, for which they received a cash prize of Rs. 50,000. They were one of ten teams to represent their institute at Round 2 held in Bangalore in May 2009. The students of SRA also represent VJTI in ROBOCON (Asia-Pacific Robot Contest), were ranked 9th in Robocon 2011 and won an award for the 'Most Economical Robot' in the same year.  Inferno Robotics  Inferno Robotics, the institute's official combat robotics organisation, was formed in 2013. The team performs designing, simulation, analysis, and fabrication of robots for different tournaments, chiefly focusing upon combat robotics for different events all over India. It also delivers lectures, mentors, and educates students for a better experience in engineering, real life situations and crisis management. In 2014, Team Inferno won six successive robotics championships. In 2015, Team Inferno stood fifth at National Robowars among 36 teams from all over India at Technovanza, 2015. In 2016, Inferno stood third at Robotic Challenge Plinth, Vadodara.  Society of Automotive Engineers, VJTI Collegiate Chapter  The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), VJTI Collegiate Chapter was formed in 2008. The SAE provides a platform for those students interested in the field of automotive engineering. SAE originally consisted of two separate clubs: VJTI Racing and Aero VJTI. Aero VJTI no longer comes under the aegis of SAE, however, and as of 2014, is an independent student body. 'Team Motorbreath' of VJTI Racing represents the VJTI in competitions in the field of land mobiles like Baja SAE of SAE International.  Aero VJTI  Aero VJTI is a club with a passion for design and development of radio-controlled aircraft. It has been participating in international competitions from as early as 2011. Since then, Aero VJTI has been to five competitions including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' Design/Build/Fly. Each competition requires students to design and manufacture a remotely piloted aircraft according to a stringent mission profile and design constraints laid out in a problem statement. VJTI has achieved top ranks in all of the competitions. The students also conduct aircraft building workshops in V.J.T.I and other colleges in Mumbai. This is done with a view to spreading knowledge regarding aeromodelling, aviation and other related topics among fellow students.  Debate & Literary Arts Society  The Debate & Literary Arts Society, known as the DLA, is a VJTI student organization under the Humanities & Management Department. The DLA's activities are primarily divided into three areas: the VJTI newsletter (VJ.News), debates, quizzes and The VJTI Model United Nations (VJMUN). Besides these, the DLA also organizes regular seminars and lectures on economics, literature, creative writing, etc. Apart from those DLA also conducts sessions on Book Club, Open Mic, etc. The DLA is responsible for many of the events organized at Pratibimb, VJTI's annual cultural festival. Its committee is led by two general secretaries who are appointed by the institute every academic year.  Entrepreneurship Cell  The Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell) of VJTI conducts events, workshops and seminars that aim to develop the management acumen and stimulate the entrepreneurial spirit in students. It conducts stand alone events ('Mandi' being a popular one) as well as management based sectors in Pratibimb, Technovanza and Enthusia, the three festivals of VJTI.  Annual festivals   Pratibimb  Pratibimb is the four-day national-level annual cultural festival of VJTI, organized under the aegis of the VJTI Cultural Group. It consists of one day devoted to intra- college (i.e. inter-departmental) competitions, termed as 'Illuminati'; while the other three days consist of events, competitions, workshops and entertainment programs that are open to students of all colleges.  Technovanza  Technovanza is the 3-day national-level annual techno- management festival of VJTI, organized by the students on non-profit basis. It consists of competitions, exhibitions, workshops and seminars on robotics, programming and other technical, management and social sectors; along with entertainment programs which usually have a technical basis. The festival is considered amongst the largest techno-management festivals in India  Rangawardhan  Rangawardhan is a four-day Annual Marathi cultural fest dedicated to promoting Marathi drama, literature, music and other art forms. It conducts performances, exhibitions, seminars and competitions during Pratibimb (VJTI's Cultural Festival), as well as its own standalone events. It stages dramatics and music performances at college functions.  Enthusia  Enthusia is the national-level annual sports festival of VJTI, organized under the aegis of VJTI Gymkhana. It is one of the largest intercollegiate sports festivals in Maharashtra and India and is held for 12 days at the VJTI campus. Engineering and medical colleges from Mumbai and Maharashtra participate in the two-week-long sporting event. The event has both inter-college & intra- college (i.e. inter-departmental) matches.  Ganeshotsav and Chetna  Ganeshotsav and Chetna are annual institute-level festivals organized by the students and managing staff of VJTI Hostels. They consist of cultural, technical and sports events, along with VJTI Hostels' Alumni Meet. Ganeshotsav occurs in the odd semester while Chetna in the even semester. 2014's Chetna was cancelled due to reasons unknown.  Departmental festivals  They are annual national-level technical festivals pertaining to a certain engineering stream and organized by students, faculty and alumni of a particular department of VJTI. They are: * Vastra Textile Manufactures Department & Textile Past Students Foundation - TPSF * Prodology Production Engineering Department & Production Engineering Students Association - PESA * Rasayana Technical & Applied Chemistry Department * Pro-Fiesta Management and Business event held by Project Management department every year  Student publications   Nirmaan  Logo of the VJTI Nirmaan Chronicle Nirmaan is the annual magazine of VJTI. Its operations are conducted under the aegis of the Nirmaan Committee. It includes articles by students, faculty and alumni. It used to be published once every academic year, and now is a running electronic copy updated more frequently. It has undertaken activities such as foreign language sessions, as part of its Globalization and Internationalization Programme, among others. As part of the 125-year quasquicentenary celebrations, the Nirmaan issue portrayed 125 years of heritage of the college, sourced from the VJTI archives.  VJ.News  The official newsletter of VJTI is published four times a year. It is managed by the Debate & Literary Arts Society. It contains institute news, placements, further studies, interviews and general topics. Alumni VJTI Alumni Association Formed in March 1944, the VJTI Alumni Association was formerly known as the VJTI Old Boys' Association. In 1973 the association was given its current name, and was formally registered with the Charities Commissioner under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The revival of the Alumni Association was spurred at Blueprint 2020, held in April 2004 with the encouragement of the then Principal and Secretary.VJTI Alumni Association Departmental alumni bodies  Several departments have their own alumni bodies which also conduct annual departmental alumni meets. These include Textile Past Students Foundation (TPSF) and Production Past Students Association. VJTI Hostels also conducts an annual alumni meet.

Most Algic languages belong to the Algonquian subfamily, dispersed over a broad area from the Rocky Mountains to Atlantic Canada. The other Algic languages are the Yurok and Wiyot of northwestern California, which, despite their geographic proximity, are not closely related. All these languages descend from Proto-Algic, a second-order proto-language estimated to have been spoken about 7,000 years ago and reconstructed using the reconstructed Proto-Algonquian language and the Wiyot and Yurok languages. Cree. Cree is the most widely spoken Algic language. History The term \\"Algic\\" was first coined by Henry Schoolcraft in his Algic Researches, published in 1839. Schoolcraft defined the term as \\"derived from the words Allegheny and Atlantic, in reference to the indigenous people anciently located in this geographical area.\\" Schoolcraft's terminology was not retained. The peoples he called \\"Algic\\" were later included among the speakers of Algonquian languages. This language group is also referred to as \\"Algonquian-Ritwan\\" and \\"Wiyot-Yurok-Algonquian\\" When Edward Sapir proposed that the well-established Algonquian family was genetically related to the Wiyot and Yurok languages of northern California, he applied the term Algic to this larger family. The Algic urheimat is thought to have been located in the Northwestern United States somewhere between the suspected homeland of the Algonquian branch (to the west of Lake Superior according to Goddard) and the earliest known location of the Wiyot and Yurok (along the middle Columbia River according to Whistler). Classification of Algic The genetic relation of Wiyot and Yurok to Algonquian was first proposed by Edward Sapir (1913, 1915, 1923), and argued against by Algonquianist Truman Michelson (1914, 1914, 1935). According to Lyle Campbell (1997), the relationship \\"has subsequently been demonstrated to the satisfaction of all\\"., who cites among others This controversy in the early classification of North American languages was called the \\"Ritwan controversy\\" because Wiyot and Yurok were assigned to a genetic grouping called \\"Ritwan\\". Most specialists now reject the validity of the Ritwan genetic node.; Berman (1982) suggested that Wiyot and Yurok share sound changes not shared by the rest of Algic (which would be explainable by either areal diffusion or genetic relatedness); Proulx (2004) argued against Berman's conclusion of common sound changes. More recently, Sergei Nikolaev has argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between the Nivkh language of Sakhalin and the Amur river basin and the Algic languages, and a secondary relationship between these two together and the Wakashan languages.

Syncerus caffer caffer, the Cape buffalo, is the typical subspecies, and the largest one, found in Southern and East Africa. S. c. nanus (the forest buffalo) is the smallest subspecies, common in forest areas of Central and West Africa, while S. c. brachyceros is in West Africa and S. c. aequinoctialis is in the savannas of East Africa. The adult African buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a \\"boss\\". It is widely regarded as one of the most dangerous animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates it gores, tramples, and kills over 200 people every year. The African buffalo is not an ancestor of domestic cattle and is only distantly related to other larger bovines. Its unpredictable temperament means that the African buffalo has never been domesticated, unlike its Asian counterpart, the water buffalo. African buffaloes have few predators aside from lions and large crocodiles. As a member of the big five game, the Cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy in hunting. Description Skull of an African buffalo The African buffalo is a very robust species. Its shoulder height can range from and its head-and-body length can range from . Compared with other large bovids, it has a long but stocky body (the body length can exceed the wild water buffalo, which is heavier and taller) and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The tail can range from long. Savannah-type buffaloes weigh , with males normally larger than females, reaching the upper weight range.Raphael, Marcel (2006) African Buffalo . In comparison, forest-type buffaloes, at , are only half that size.Boitani, Luigi, Simon & Schuster's Guide to Mammals. Simon & Schuster/Touchstone Books (1984), Its head is carried low; its top is located below the backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rear, which is associated with the need to support the weight of the front part of the body, which is heavier and more powerful than the back. Savannah-type buffaloes have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls often have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are 30-40% smaller, reddish brown in colour, with much more hair growth around the ears and with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats. A characteristic feature of the horns of adult male African buffalo (southern and eastern populations) is that the bases come very close together, forming a shield referred to as a \\"boss\\". From the base, the horns diverge downwards, then smoothly curve upwards and outwards and in some cases inwards and or backwards. In large bulls, the distance between the ends of the horns can reach upwards of one metre (the record being 64.5 inches 164 cm). The horns form fully when the animal reaches the age of 5 or 6 years old, but the bosses do not become \\"hard\\" until it reaches the age of 8 to 9 years old. In cows, the horns are, on average, 10‚Äì20% smaller, and they do not have a boss. Forest-type buffalo horns are smaller than those of the savanna-type buffaloes from Southern and East Africa, usually measuring less than , and are almost never fused.

It is peculiar to Southern and East Africa. Buffaloes of this subspecies living in the south of the continent, notably tall in size and ferocity, are the so-called Cape buffalo. Color of this subspecies is the darkest, almost black. * S. c. nanus (the forest buffalo, dwarf buffalo or Congo buffalo) is the smallest of the subspecies; the height at the withers is less than 120 cm and average weight is about , or about the size of a zebra, and two to three times lighter in mass than the nominate subspecies.Korte, L. M. (2008). Variation of group size among African buffalo herds in a forest‚Äêsavanna mosaic landscape. Journal of Zoology, 275(3), 229-236. The color is red, with darker patches on the head and shoulders, and in the ears, forming a brush. The forest buffalo is common in forest areas of Central and West Africa. This subspecies is so different from the Cape buffalo that some researchers still consider it to be a separate species, S. nanus. Hybrids between the Cape and forest buffalo are not uncommon. * S. c. brachyceros (the Sudan buffalo) is, in morphological terms, intermediate between the first two subspecies. It occurs in West Africa. Its dimensions are relatively small, especially compared to other buffalo found in Cameroon, which weigh half as much as the Cape subspecies (bulls weighing are considered to be very large). Adults average in weight up to .Brown, W. (1988). Age determination of the West African buffalo Syncerus caffer brachyceros and the constancy of tooth wear.

It lives in swamps and floodplains, as well as mopane grasslands, and the forests of the major mountains of Africa. This buffalo prefers a habitat with dense cover, such as reeds and thickets, but can also be found in open woodland.Estes, R. (1991) The Behavior Guide to African Mammals, Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates. Los Angeles, The University of California Press. pp. 195‚Äì200 While not particularly demanding in regard to habitat, they require water daily, and so they depend on perennial sources of water. Like the plains zebra, the buffalo can live on tall, coarse grasses. Herds of buffalo mow down grasses and make way for more selective grazers. When feeding, the buffalo makes use of its tongue and wide incisor row to eat grass more quickly than most other African herbivores. Buffaloes do not stay on trampled or depleted areas for long. Other than humans, African buffaloes have few predators and are capable of defending themselves against (and killing) lions. Lions do kill and eat buffaloes regularly, and in some regions, the buffaloes are the lions' primary prey. It typically takes quite a few lions to bring down a single adult buffalo, and the entire pride usually joins in the hunt. However, several incidents have been reported in which lone adult male lions have successfully brought down adult buffaloes. The average- sized crocodile typically attacks only old solitary animals and young calves, though they can kill healthy adults. Exceptionally large, old male Nile crocodiles may become semi-habitual predators of buffaloes. This crocodilian is the only animal that typically takes down an adult buffalo alone, whereas a pride attack is the preferred method of lions when taking down such large prey.Graham, A. D. (1968). The Lake Rudolf Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti) Population. Masters of Science Thesis, The University of East Africa. The cheetah, leopard, and spotted hyena are normally a threat only to newborn calves, though very large clans of spotted hyenas have been recorded killing cows (mainly pregnant ones) and, on very rare occasions, full-grown bulls.Trinkel, M. (2010). Prey selection and prey preferences of spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta in the Etosha National Park, Namibia. Ecological research, 25(2), 413-417.Hayward, M. W. (2006). Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and degree of dietary overlap with the lion (Panthera leo). Journal of Zoology, 270(4), 606-614. Diseases The African buffalo is susceptible to many diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, corridor disease, and foot and mouth disease. As with many diseases, these problems remain dormant within a population as long as the health of the animals is good. These diseases do, however, restrict the legal movements of the animals and fencing infected areas from unaffected areas is enforced. Some wardens and game managers have managed to protect and breed \\"disease-free\\" herds which become very valuable because they can be transported. Most well-known are Lindsay Hunt's efforts to source uninfected animals from the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Some disease-free buffaloes in South Africa have been sold to breeders for close to US$130,000. Social behavior An African buffalo herd Herd size is highly variable. The core of the herds is made up of related females, and their offspring, in an almost linear dominance hierarchy. The basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females, and old or invalid animals. The young males keep their distance from the dominant bull, which is recognizable by the thickness of his horns. During the dry season, males split from the herd and form bachelor groups. Two types of bachelor herds occur: ones made of males aged four to seven years and those of males 12 years or older. During the wet season, the younger bulls rejoin a herd to mate with the females. They stay with them throughout the season to protect the calves. Some older bulls cease to rejoin the herd, as they can no longer compete with the younger, more aggressive males. Males have a linear dominance hierarchy based on age and size. Since a buffalo is safer when a herd is larger, dominant bulls may rely on subordinate bulls and sometimes tolerate their copulation. Bulls in position to spar Adult bulls spar in play, dominance interactions, or actual fights. A bull approaches another, lowing, with his horns down, and waits for the other bull to do the same thing. When sparring, the bulls twist their horns from side to side.Sinclair, A. R. E. (1977) The African Buffalo. Chicago, The University of Chicago Press. If the sparring is for play, the bull may rub his opponent's face and body during the sparring session. Actual fights are violent but rare and brief. Calves may also spar in play, but adult females rarely spar at all. African buffaloes are notable for their apparent altruism. Females appear to exhibit some sort of \\"voting behavior\\". During resting time, the females stand up, shuffle around, and sit back down again. They sit in the direction they think they should move. After an hour of more shuffling, the females travel in the direction they decide. This decision is communal and not based on hierarchy or dominance. When chased by predators, a herd sticks close together and makes it hard for the predators to pick off one member. Calves are gathered in the middle. A buffalo herd responds to the distress call of a captured member and tries to rescue it. A calf's distress call gets the attention of not only the mother, but also the herd. Buffaloes engage in mobbing behavior when fighting off predators. They have been recorded killing a lion and chasing lions up trees and keeping them there for two hours, after the lions have killed a member of their group. Lion cubs can get trampled and killed. In one videotaped instance, known as the Battle at Kruger, a calf survived an attack by both lions and a crocodile after intervention of the herd. Vocalizations African buffaloes make various vocalizations. Many calls are lower-pitched versions of those emitted by domestic cattle. They emit low-pitched, two- to four-second calls intermittently at three- to six-second intervals to signal the herd to move. To signal to the herd to change direction, leaders emit \\"gritty\\", \\"creaking gate\\" sounds. When moving to drinking places, some individuals make long \\"maaa\\" calls up to 20 times a minute. When being aggressive, they make explosive grunts that may last long or turn into a rumbling growl. Cows produce croaking calls when looking for their calves. Calves make a similar call of a higher pitch when in distress. When threatened by predators, they make drawn-out \\"waaaa\\" calls. Dominant individuals make calls to announce their presence and location. A version of the same call, but more intense, is emitted as a warning to an encroaching inferior. When grazing, they make various sounds, such as brief bellows, grunts, honks, and croaks. Reproduction African buffaloes mate and give birth only during the rainy seasons. Birth peak takes place early in the season, while mating peaks later. A bull closely guards a cow that comes into heat, while keeping other bulls at bay. This is difficult, as cows are quite evasive and attract many males to the scene. By the time a cow is in full estrus, only the most dominant bull in the herd/subherd is there. Cows first calve at five years of age, after a gestation period of 11.5 months. Newborn calves remain hidden in vegetation for the first few weeks while being nursed occasionally by the mother before joining the main herd. Older calves are held in the centre of the herd for safety. The maternal bond between mother and calf lasts longer than in most bovids. That bonding ends when a new calf is born, and the mother then keeps her previous offspring at bay with horn jabs. Nevertheless, the yearling follows its mother for another year or so. Males leave their mothers when they are two years old and join the bachelor groups. Young calves, unusually for bovids, suckle from behind their mothers, pushing their heads between the mothers' legs.

The African buffalo was listed as least concern by the IUCN \\"as the species had a global population estimated at nearly 900,000 animals, of which more than three-quarters are in protected areas. However, in 2019 the African buffalo was listed as a near threatened species, with only 400,000 individuals left. While some populations (subspecies) are decreasing, others will remain unchanged in the long term if large, healthy populations continue to persist in a substantial number of national parks, equivalent reserves and hunting zones in southern and eastern Africa.\\" In the most recent and available census data at continental scale, the total estimated numbers of the three savanna-type African buffalo subspecies (S. c. caffer, S. c. brachyceros and S. c. aequinoctialis) are at 513,000 individuals.Melletti M. and Burton J. (eds). 2014. Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour of Wild Cattle: Implications for Conservation. Cambridge University Press In the past, numbers of African buffaloes suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates. Being a member of the big five game group, a term originally used to describe the five most dangerous animals to hunt, the Cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy, with some hunters paying over $10,000 for the opportunity to hunt one. The larger bulls are targeted for their trophy value, although in some areas, buffaloes are still hunted for meat.  Attacks  One of the \\"big five\\" African game, it is known as \\"the Black Death\\" or \\"the widowmaker\\", and is widely regarded as a very dangerous animal. According to some estimates, it gores and kills over 200 people every year. African buffaloes are sometimes reported to kill more people in Africa than any other animal, although the same claim is also made of hippopotamuses and crocodiles. These numbers may be somewhat overestimated; for example, in the country of Mozambique, attacks, especially fatal ones, were much less frequent on humans than those by hippos and, especially, Nile crocodiles.Dunham, K. M., Ghiurghi, A., Cumbi, R., & Urbano, F. (2010). Human‚Äìwildlife conflict in Mozambique: a national perspective, with emphasis on wildlife attacks on humans. Oryx, 44(2), 185-193. In Uganda, on the other hand, large herbivores were found to attack more people on average than lions or leopards and have a higher rate of inflicting fatalities during attacks than the predators (the African buffalo, in particular, killing humans in 49.5% of attacks on them), but hippos and even elephants may still kill more people per annum here than buffaloes.Treves, A., & Naughton-Treves, L. (1999). Risk and opportunity for humans coexisting with large carnivores. Journal of Human Evolution, 36(3), 275-282. African buffaloes are notorious among big-game hunters as very dangerous animals, with wounded animals reported to ambush and attack pursuers.

Yarrell is best known as the author of The History of British Fishes (2 vols., 1836) and A History of British Birds featuring 564 original engravings (in 3 vols., first ed. 1843, second ed. 1845, third ed. 1856). The latter went into several editions and was the standard reference work for a generation of British ornithologists. He described Bewick's swan in 1830, distinguishing it from the larger whooper swan. Early life Yarrell was born in Duke Street, St James's to Francis Yarrell and his wife Sarah (n√©e Blane). His father and uncle ran a newspaper agency and bookshop. He studied at Dr Nicholson's school in Ealing. His father died in 1794 and the Yarrells moved the short distance to Great Ryder Street, where William lived the rest of his life. In 1802 he became a clerk with the Herries, Farquhar and Co. bank. In 1803 he and his cousin, Edward Jones, joined his father's business.Anon. (1858) [Obituary] Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society 2:33‚Äì36 scanned He sometimes left the business in Jones's care, going into the countryside to fish and shoot. He acquired the reputation of being the best shot and the best angler in London, soon becoming an expert naturalist. He sent many bird specimens to Thomas Bewick, who engraved them as woodcuts. Career Egyptian vulture in Yarrell's A History of British Birds (1843) He joined the Royal Institution in 1817. His first publication, at the age of 40, was \\"On the Occurrence of some Rare British Birds\\" (1825). This was published in the 2nd volume of the 'Zoological Journal' and he later became one of that journal's editors. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1825. He wrote in 1827 on the structure of the tracheae of birds and on plumage changes in pheasants. He corresponded and shared specimens with other naturalists including Thomas Bewick (from 1825), Sir William Jardine, Prideaux John Selby and Nicholas Aylward Vigors, as well as with the Cornish naturalist Jonathan Couch, who provided him with many specimens, especially of fish. Yarrell was one of the original members of the Zoological Society of London. In 1833, he was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. He was acknowledged by John James Audubon both as a \\"valued friend\\" and for the information and \\"precious specimens of birds and eggs, collected in the desolate regions of the extreme north.\\" He served for many years as treasurer both of the Entomological Society and of the Linnean Society. Works Yarrell's major works were A History of British Fishes (1836) and A History of British Birds (1843), the latter having the same title as the popular book by Thomas Bewick, published from 1797 to 1804, but with a different set of wood- engravings. British Birds was first published \\"in thirty-seven parts of three sheets each, at intervals of two months; the first Part was issued in July 1837 and the last in May 1843.\\" The sheets were then collected into two volumes, with the addition of \\"many occurrences of rare birds and of some that were even new to Britain\\". The additional birds were listed and briefly described in the Preface and \\"the new subjects have been engraved on single leaves, so paged, that the bookbinder may insert these separate leaves among the birds of the genus to which each respectively belongs.\\" British Birds was illustrated with drawings by Alexander Fussell. Yarrell thanks him for \\"nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed\\". The pen for the remaining drawings (the title-page asserts there are 520 in the book) is not stated. Yarrell also thanks John Thompson (1785‚Äì1866) and his sons for the \\"very long series of engravings\\" of the drawings, as well as his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley. At the time of its release, Yarrell's Birds was considered the best work on the subject both scientifically and artistically, as noted by Prof. Alfred Newton in his \\"Prospectus\\" to the 1871 edition, from which Yarrell's introduction was removed along with the names of contributing artists under Thompson's direction. Both Yarrell's books were so popular that their publisher stated that sales exceeded ¬£4,000. Thomas R Forbes, in his biographical paper on Yarrell, writes that \\"All [editions of Birds] are outstanding because of the author's clear, narrative style, accuracy, careful scholarship and unassuming charm.\\" Yarrell's last paper, \\"On the Influence of the Sexual Organ in Modifying External Character\\" (1856), described an experiment that disproved the belief that when a stag lacks a healthy testicle, it will fail to grow an antler on that side of the body. Legacy Yarrell died during a trip to Great Yarmouth and a memorial was erected in St James's Church, Piccadilly. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's in Bayford, Hertfordshire, with his chosen epitaph \\"He was the survivor of twelve brothers and sisters, who, with their father and mother, are all placed close to this spot\\" together with William Wordsworth's lines \\"first and last, The earliest summon'd and the longest spared ‚Äî Are here deposited.\\" Yarrell has a number of species named after him, including the birds yellow-faced siskin (Carduelis yarrellii) and Chilean woodstar (Eulidia yarrellii) and the fish Yarrell's blenny (Chirolophis ascanii). The British subspecies of the white wagtail, the pied wagtail (Motacilla alba yarrellii), was also named for him. A memorial to William Yarrell in St James's Church, Piccadilly.

Based on Meg Cabot's 2000 young adult novel of the same name, the film was written by Gina Wendkos and stars Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews, with a supporting cast consisting of H√©ctor Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, Mandy Moore, Caroline Goodall and Robert Schwartzman. The film follows Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway), a shy American teenager who learns she is heir to the throne of a European kingdom. Under the tutelage of her estranged grandmother (Andrews), the kingdom's reigning queen, Mia must decide whether to claim the throne she has inherited or renounce her title permanently. Feeling confident about the novel's film potential, Cabot's agent pursued producer Debra Martin Chase about adapting The Princess Diaries into a feature-length film, an idea she pitched to Disney upon reading the book. After obtaining the film rights, Disney originally greenlit the project under the title The Princess of Tribeca, reverting it once its setting was changed from New York to San Francisco, where the majority of the film was shot between September and December 2000. Marshall, who was known for helming several romantic comedies, agreed to direct because he found the story ideal for family entertainment. Despite having little involvement in the film's development, Cabot was consulted about various changes to its story and characters. Hathaway won the lead role over several established young actresses in her motion picture debut, while The Princess Diaries commemorated the end of Andrews' semi- retirement from acting and return to Disney films, her first since Mary Poppins (1964). Released on August 3, 2001, the film was an unexpected commercial success, grossing over $165 million worldwide. Despite earning mixed reviews for its plot and themes, Hathaway's performance was widely praised by film critics. Ranking among the most profitable films of 2001, The Princess Diaries defied industry expectations as pundits had expected the film to underperform due to its G-rating and subject matter. The film's success is credited with establishing Hathaway as a bankable actress and reviving Andrews' film career. A sequel, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, was released in 2004 to similar success, while rumors of a possible third installment have persisted since 2015. Plot Shy high school student Mia Thermopolis resides with her mother Helen in a refurbished firehouse in San Francisco. Unpopular among her peers, Mia suffers from a fear of public speaking while harboring a crush on Josh Bryant, and is often teased by his popular girlfriend Lana Thomas. Mia's only friends are social outcast Lilly Moscovitz (who has known her since childhood) and Lilly's older brother, Michael, who secretly harbors feelings for her. Mia's estranged father dies, and she is visited by his mother Clarisse. Clarisse is the Queen of the European kingdom of Genovia, and she explains that Mia is now her sole heir. Clarisse is determined to groom Mia into a refined princess so that she may one day rule the kingdom over which Clarisse currently presides. Overwhelmed by the discovery, Mia initially refuses until Helen convinces her to attend her grandmother's \\"princess lessons\\" on the condition that she may need to not make her final decision until the Genovian Independence Day Ball in three weeks' time. Mia receives a glamorous makeover and a limousine chauffeured by Joe, the queen's head of security and confidante, who becomes a father figure to her. Mia's transformation causes her schoolmates to treat her differently, while her increasingly hectic schedule strains her relationship with Lilly. To appease her best friend, Mia tells Lilly the truth and swears her to secrecy. However, the public soon learns that Mia is a princess after the secret is sold to the press by Paolo, the hairdresser responsible for Mia's makeover, and the paparazzi begin to pursue her relentlessly. Although Mia embarrasses herself at her first state dinner, the queen admits that she found her clumsiness endearing and suggests that they spend quality time together. While bonding, Clarisse explains that although Mia's parents loved each other, they divorced amicably in order to pursue their own passions, Philippe remaining in Genovia to eventually become King, and Helen returning to America with Mia to offer her a \\"normal\\" childhood. As Mia's popularity grows, Josh invites her to attend a beach party with him. Mia accepts, causing her to neglect Lilly and forego her plans with Michael. Josh kisses Mia in front of the paparazzi to bolster his own fame, while Lana helps the paparazzi photograph Mia wearing only a towel; both photographs are printed in the newspaper the following day. Finding the photos inappropriate for a princess, Clarisse admonishes Mia for her behavior, after which a humiliated Mia promises to renounce her title. Joe reminds Clarisse that Mia is still only a teenager, suggesting that the queen, as a grandmother, was too hard on her only grandchild. After making amends with Lilly, Mia finally stands up to Lana for bullying a schoolmate. Mia invites both Lilly and Michael to the ball but Michael declines, still heartbroken over Mia's initial dismissal. After Clarisse apologizes to Mia for scolding her, she states that Mia must publicly renounce the throne at the ball. Terrified by the prospect, Mia plans to run away until she discovers a touching letter from her late father and relents. Mia's car malfunctions while driving to the ball, stranding her in a downpour until she is retrieved by Joe. When they finally arrive, Mia, still wet and untidy from the rain, delivers a compelling speech and accepts her role as Princess of Genovia. After changing into a gown, Mia accompanies Clarisse into the ballroom where Michael, who has accepted Mia's apology, invites her to dance before confessing their feelings for each other and sharing their first kiss. In the final scene, Mia is shown traveling to Genovia in a private plane with her pet cat Fat Louie, and writes in her diary that she plans to relocate to Genovia with her mother. Cast Order of credits adapted from Variety magazine and Turner Classic Movies: Production  Development  The Princess Diaries is based on the young adult novel of the same name by author Meg Cabot. Cabot's agent believed that the first Princess Diaries book had strong film potential, and pursued film producer Debra Martin Chase, who had recently co- produced the television film Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997), about adapting the book into a film due to their similar \\"rags-to-riches\\" and \\"Cinderella-type\\" themes. Chase highly enjoyed the book and convinced Disney to adapt the novel into a feature-length production. Disney chairman Peter Schneider optioned the project in an \\"effort to re-establish the Disney brand for live-action family films\\". Cabot was thrilled to learn that Disney was interested in her book, the film rights for which the studio paid her $4,000, although some media outlets reported that Cabot had been offered \\"mid- to low- six figures\\". Cabot recalled that Disney's decision to adapt The Princess Diaries resulted in her getting promoted at her own job, prior to which she had struggled to convince publishers to publish her novel, the content of which some found inappropriate for young readers. Several publishers had rejected Cabot's manuscript before HarperCollins showed interest in 1999, followed by Disney shortly afterward. Garry Marshall served as the film's director. He changed the film's setting from New York to San Francisco in honor of his grandchildren. By August 1999, the film was greenlit by Disney, who agreed to produce it with singer Whitney Houston's BrownHouse Productions, and Cabot's manuscript was forwarded to potential screenwriters. The Princess Diaries was Houston's first feature film production venture, and her studio's second film after Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella. Chase developed the script with screenwriter Gina Wendkos. Although Cabot did not write the screenplay herself, she worked closely with Chase to discuss changes deemed necessary to translate the story from page to screen, maintaining that \\"The essence of the story, or the message, of staying true to yourself ... still comes through\\". Garry Marshall was enlisted as director, with Houston and Chase producing alongside Mario Iscovich. Marshall was invited to direct the project while he himself had been pitching ideas to Disney executive Nina Jacobson. Connecting with the material, Marshall found the story enjoyable for entire families, and was particularly drawn towards the idea of \\"a young girl turning into a woman and realizing that she can have a positive effect on the world\\". Marshall elaborated, \\"I wanted to do a fairy tale for the fairy tale crowd, which are the young girls and boys\\", hoping that the project to crossover to adult audiences as well. Furthermore, the director admitted to being fond of \\"female wish-fulfillment and empowerment movies\\"; Houston and Chase hoped that The Princess Diaries would be BrownHouse Productions' first in a series of female-led wish-fulfillment films, originally planning to remake the musical film Sparkle (1976) as a follow up. However, Marshall nearly declined to work on the film due to a typo in the original treatment that read \\"The Princess Dairies\\", joking, \\"I thought it was a movie about privileged cows!\\" The Princess Diaries was optioned to challenge the belief that children were losing interest in live-action films targeted towards girls, and Marshall was hired specifically to make a G-rated film \\"edgy and crazy and maybe something the adults will like\\". The film differs considerably from the novel. Initially intended to be set in New York like Cabot's book, the film was originally called The Princess of Tribeca. The title was reverted once the setting was changed to San Francisco, California, a decision Marshall made because the latter is home to both himself and his granddaughters, to whom the film is dedicated. Although Mia and Lilly remain environmentally and politically conscious, the filmmakers softened some of the more political aspects of their personalities to prevent the film from resembling \\"a political diatribe\\". Some aspects of the script were inspired by Cabot's own childhood, particularly when her mother began dating one of her teachers shortly after her father's death. Despite being consulted about such changes, Cabot preferred to distance herself from the creative process to preserve her own mental health in fear of compromising her vision for future novels, insisting that the book and film exist in separate universes. Cabot maintains that she had little creative input in the film, elaborating, \\"I don't think Garry Marshall needs 'help' to make a movie‚Ä¶ from a novelist who has absolutely no experience in film-making.\\" Although Cabot admitted that Disney consulted with her before making changes, she described their conversations as more informative than collaborative. Cabot acknowledged the challenge of adapting a 300-page novel, which she had written in the form of a diary, into a 90-page screenplay but was ultimately satisfied with the final results and Marshall's direction. Casting Liv Tyler (pictured) was one of several established actresses originally considered for the role of Mia until newcomer Anne Hathaway auditioned. Chase decided that, in terms of ethnicity, the film's cast would remain faithful to the novel due to Mia and Clarisse ruling a European country, and Chase preferring to \\"make good movies\\" as opposed to limiting herself to African-American films. Anne Hathaway was cast in the lead role of Mia Thermopolis after Juliette Lewis, to whom the role had originally been offered, declined. 18 years-old at the time, The Princess Diaries was Hathaway's first major film role, for which she auditioned during a 26-hour layover in Los Angeles, California while traveling to New Zealand to film The Other Side of Heaven (2001). Her only prior acting credit had been in the short-lived television series Get Real. Hathaway was very nervous during her audition, to the point at which she fell out of her chair; her inherent clumsiness is credited with impressing Marshall. Several established young actresses had been considered for the role, including Reese Witherspoon, Kirsten Dunst, Alicia Silverstone, Jessica Biel, Claire Danes, Kate Hudson, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Brittany Murphy, Katie Holmes, Christina Applegate, Kate Beckinsale and Eva Mendes, while Liv Tyler was deemed a front-runner. Christy Carlson Romano was unable to audition due to scheduling conflicts while filming the Disney Channel series Even Stevens. Marshall's granddaughters ultimately convinced the director to cast Hathaway over Tyler because they felt that she possessed the more \\"princess-like hair\\". The actress was cast based on her sole audition without performing a screen test. Although Marshall believed that several other actresses seemed capable of embodying Mia's comedic aspects, he determined that only Hathaway possessed \\"the grace and authority\\" to deliver the character's final speech. Hathaway identified with her character's struggles and personality, explaining, \\"Mia was very similar to the person I was in high school\\", describing herself as a wallflower to whom few paid attention and appreciating the opportunity to be herself in a film. Hathaway's appearance and performance reminded Marshall of Julia Roberts, whom he had directed to great success in the romantic comedy Pretty Woman (1990), describing her as a fusion of Roberts and comedian Harpo Marx due to her combination of glamour and physical comedy, which he also likened to his own sister Penny Marshall. Hathaway gained weight for the role to closer resemble \\"a regular teen\\". The actress credits Marshall with teaching her the most important lesson of her career: \\"You never know what's going to be a hit, so you might as well have fun making it.\\" alt=Julie Andrews, who had been semi-retired from acting at the time, was cast as Clarisse Renaldi, Mia's grandmother and Queen of Genovia. Marshall personally invited Andrews to discuss the film with him; Andrews identified the director as \\"the hook\\" that convinced her to accept the role, having been a long-time fan of his work. She accepted the role based solely on her conversations with Marshall without reading Wendkos' script. Although Sophia Loren is rumored to have been offered the role, Marshall insists that Andrews is the first and only actress he considered, having been a fan of hers since Broadway's My Fair Lady (1956). Known for portraying princesses and nobility throughout her career, Andrews incorporated knowledge she had acquired about European royalty and mannerisms of Britain's royal family into her performance as Mia's regal mentor; Queen Elizabeth II herself had knighted Andrews one year prior, making her a Dame of the British Empire. Marshall allowed Andrews significant freedom to determine Clarisse's portrayal. Cabot was initially hesitant about Andrews' casting, fearing that the actress was too kind to play such a stern character, but ultimately relented upon seeing her interpretation, explaining that Andrews possessed \\"just the right amount of regalness mixed with grandmotherly warmth\\". Andrews also used the opportunity to mentor Hathaway, although she maintains that the younger actress required very little training: \\"She has great instincts, good talent ... She has this ability to do humor, comedy, very well. So other than actually honing her craft and learning from the doing, she has it all.‚Äù The Princess Diaries was Andrews' first Disney film since Mary Poppins (1964), the role for which she had won an Academy Award for Best Actress 37 years prior, and her first feature film in 15 years. Marshall cast Heather Matarazzo as Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz after casting director Marcia Ross introduced them to each other, insisting that Matarazzo is different from other actresses. Matarazzo attended a chemistry reading with Hathaway after auditioning for Marshall; Hathaway believes that the two actresses had met each other several times prior, none of which Matarazzo remembers, expounding, \\"I was such a sarcastic, little punk-ass kid that couldn't be bothered by cheerfulness\\" while \\"She's such a warmhearted, beautiful, sweet, soulful woman\\". Matarazzo insists that they got along well despite their differences, likening their on-screen chemistry to Richard Gere and Roberts' in Pretty Woman. Furthermore, the actress cites Marshall as her favourite director, whose positive energy she described as unrivaled by other directors. Matarazzo was also starstruck by the opportunity to work with Andrews, whose films she had idolized as a child, and often asked for the actress' autograph. H√©ctor Elizondo was cast as Joe, Mia's limousine driver and Clarisse's head of security. Elizondo is known for appearing in all 18 films Marshall directed. Singer Mandy Moore was cast as Mia's school rival Lana Thomas, her first credited film role. Marshall was the first film director with whom Moore, sixteen years old at the time, ever worked; she recalled that the director \\"had no business casting me ... I didn't know what I was doing. So I think the highlight of the film was working with him.\\" Moore also appreciated the fact that several most of her co-stars were similar to her in age, crediting the overall experience with setting her acting career \\"in motion\\". Robert Schwartzman was cast as Michael, Mia's love interest and Lilly's brother. His real-life band Rooney has a cameo appearance as garage band Flypaper, with Schwartzman playing their lead singer. The musicians perform \\"Blueside\\", one of Rooney's original songs. Schwartzman wanted to change his last name in the credits to Cage in honor of his cousin Nicolas Cage, but the film's promotional material had already been finalized. The Princess Diaries remains Schwartzman's only major film role. Marshall cast several of his own family members in supporting and minor roles. Kathleen Marshall, Marshall's daughter, plays Clarisse's secretary Charlotte Kutaway. Charlotte's surname is only revealed during the closing credits; Marshall explained that the character was named after how often she is used in cutaway shots, and her role references the filmmaking technique in which \\"whenever anything goes wrong in the film, you cut away to someone\\". Marshall's wife appears as a ball guest, while his twin granddaughters Lily and Charlotte, the same granddaughters who inspired him to cast Hathaway, appear as a pair of schoolgirls asking for Mia's autograph. Marshall himself has a brief cameo during the Genovian Independence Day Ball, alongside sister Penny. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown portrayed himself in a cameo appearance, during which he is briefly interviewed upon arriving at the same ball.  Further writing  Further adjustments were made to finesse the script once the cast was finalized. Marshall was constantly conceiving new ways to make the film funnier, as Disney had challenged him to incorporate humor into the G-rated film. Marshall's approach to the film's humor was reminiscent of his television contributions to shows such as Happy Days and The Odd Couple, the original scripts for which he revisited to remind himself how to approach family-oriented comedies. Matarazzo described the set as a collaborative environment, recalling that Marshall encouraged a family-like atmosphere abiding by his motto \\"Life is more important than show business.\\" Marshall would sometimes hold parades for the entire crew, particularly when it was a cast or crew members' birthday. The director celebrated his own birthday while filming, during which Houston herself serenaded him with a rendition of \\"Happy Birthday\\". The character of Mia's grandmother, nicknamed \\"Grandmere\\" in the novel, is depicted as considerably kinder in the film. Disney's decision to have Mia's father be deceased in the film is among the most significant deviations from its source material, in which he is both alive and has an integral role. The producers decided to kill off Mia's father in favor of expanding her grandmother's role, which they had been considering offering to Andrews from the beginning. Upon learning that Disney was interested in casting a \\"big name\\" actress such as Andrews in the role, Cabot approved that Mia's father be eliminated, much of whose dialogue was re-written for Mia's grandmother. Marshall wrote Hathaway's childhood struggles with speaking while wearing a retainer into the film; the actress filmed a scene wearing the same retainer she had worn as a child. Elizondo and Andrews campaigned for a romantic relationship between their characters, an idea that originated during a table reading in which the actors uttered \\"you're cute\\" to each other. The actors improvised their dance sequence. Elizondo credits this with evolving his character into more than simply \\"a guy who drove a limo\\". Upon Marshall's request, Andrews suggested that the fictional country of Genovia be famous for its pears, after which point the set was decorated with artificial pears and pear-shaped statues. Marshall worked with Larry Miller, who portrays Mia's hair stylist Paolo, to improvise humour moments, such as shrieking upon seeing Mia for the first time and drawing his styling tools from his pockets as though they are pistols. Wendkos wrote that Miller's Paolo was deliberately written as an \\"over-the-top\\" character. \\"Not you, I don't even know you\\", one of Matarazzo's most oft-quoted lines which she utters to someone while running down the street, was entirely improvised at the suggestion of Chase. Joe recites \\"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent\\" to Mia, a famous quote originally by former United States First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Mia recites one of Juliet's soliloquies from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, a deliberate reference to the fact that Hathaway shares her full name with Shakespeare's wife. Houston conceived the scene in which Mia smears her ice cream cone on Lana's cheerleader uniform. Wendkos spent more effort revising Mia's makeover sequence than any other scene in the filming, wanting to achieve a \\"clearer progression from the ugly duckling to the ingenue\\", as per Marshall's request. The film contains several references to Pretty Woman, another film directed by Marshall to which The Princess Diaries has often been compared. In addition to sharing a \\"Pygmalion-esque transformation story\\", both films share several cast members. Both Elizondo and Miller had appeared in Pretty Woman. Most notably, actor Alan Kent, portraying a waiter, delivers the same line he once delivered to Julia Roberts' character in Pretty Woman during the scene in which Mia accidentally breaks a glass. Filming  Set and locations  The Princess Diaries was filmed on a budget of $26 million. Principal photography took place between September 18 and December 8, 2000, with filming beginning one month before Cabot's novel was published. The Princess Diaries was filmed on Stage 2 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, the same sound stage on which Mary Poppins, which starred Andrews in the titular role, had been filmed during the 1960s. The stage was later renamed the \\"Julie Andrews Stage\\" in honor of the actress' contributions. Andrews recalled having to constantly walk up and down the set's main staircase while struggling to remain regal and composed in appearance. Additionally, Marshall resided in the same house that Andrews herself had rented while filming Mary Poppins, having lived in the building since 1974. Marshall joked that he and the actress had \\"amazing\\" karma due to sharing several similarities and coincidences. The Washington Post contributor Kristal Brent Zook remarked that Marshall and Andrews have also \\"proved themselves masters of the modern fairy tale\\" due to both of their repertoires consisting largely of romantic, Cinderella-themed material. The film was shot on several locations throughout California, with Alverno High School serving as Mia's private school Grove High School. A refurbished fire station named Engine Company No. 43 was used as Mia and Helen's home, located on Brazil Avenue. In 2014, the building was listed for sale at $2.6 million. Mount St. Mary's College, formerly the Doheny Mansion, was used as the location for The Genovian Consulate. Unlike much of the film, which was filmed in San Francisco, the beach party sequence was filmed in Malibu. The production designers decorated Malibu's Zuma Beach to resemble San Francisco's Baker Beach. To help Hathaway feel more comfortable on set, many of its props belonged to the actress' family. Mia's photograph of her late father is a photograph of Hathaway's own father, Gerald Hathaway. Gerald also briefly portrays the character during a flashback sequence in which he writes a letter to Mia. Mia's pet cat Fat Louie was portrayed by four different cats, one of whom was owned by Hathaway herself. Each cat served a different purpose: one was meant to be carried, another sat still for extended periods of time, a third was used for jumping and stunts, and the final (Hathaway's) is featured during the film's final scene. During the state dinner in which a guest's arm catches fire, the fire was intended to be extinguished once the actor placed his arm in a nearby ice bucket. However, when the fire persisted, Hathaway panicked and doused it with a glass of water, an improvisation that was kept in the film. Hathaway tripped and fell while filming a scene in which she is walking atop bleachers during the rain, but continued to recite her lines as though nothing had happened. Marshall found the unscripted incident funny and decided to retain it. Matarazzo, who had been filming the scene with Hathaway, identified this moment as \\"a testament to the kind of person that she is, not just professionally but personally‚Ä¶ You fall, you laugh, and you keep going\\". She also identified this as her favorite moment while filming. While filming the final dance sequence, the crew played Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" (1989) for the cast to dance to; multiple takes were required because the cast kept instinctively lip syncing its lyrics. The track was dubbed by a different song in the final edit.  Costume design  Costume designer Gary Jones, who had worked with Marshall prior, after they were together as a couple for 10 years they were drawn to the film due to the wide range of costumes required for its characters, describing the project as \\"a costume designer's dream come true\\". Jones worked closely with Andrews while designing Clarisse's costumes, drawing inspiration from Chanel, Bill Blass and Christian Dior. The gown Andrews wears to the state dinner is an homage to her stage role as My Fair Lady's Eliza Doolittle, which was handmade in China. Jones envisioned Mia as a character who is shy about her body at first, opting to dress her in layers consisting of long sleeves and loose-fitting clothing. The actress' periwinkle state dinner gown was inspired by a dress worn by Princess Victoria of Sweden, with Jones describing it as \\"a bow to the Renaissance and Romeo and Juliet\\", accessorizing it with an 18-carat diamond ring. Both Hathaway and Andrews' tiara's were designed and custom-made specifically for their respective actresses, with the designers ensuring that both characters' crowns were appropriate for their age. The tiara and jewelry Andrews wears during the final scene consists of half a million dollars‚Äô worth of diamonds, loaned to the production by jeweler Harry Winston, with whom Jones worked closely to obtain several unique jewels. A security guard followed Andrews at all times to both protect her and ensure that all jewels were returned at the end of each day. Andrews' peach taffeta ballgown was accessorized with a 100-carat necklace comprising four rows of diamonds. Andrews donned the same necklace to that year's Academy Awards ceremony. Hathaway's tiara was considerably less expensive, consisting of cubic zirconia as opposed to authentic jewels. The crowns and tiaras worn by both actresses are preserved by the Walt Disney Archives, into which they were inducted in 2016 to commemorate the film's 15th anniversary. Hathaway donned false eyebrows and a wig to make her character's makeover more dramatic. Hathaway's hair piece was nicknamed \\"The Beast\\", while her eyebrows required one hour to apply; each strand of hair was glued to her brow individually. At times Hathaway was required to leave the set in full costume, claiming that she \\"never felt so alone in [her] entire life\\".  Themes  Due to its themes, The Princess Diaries has been heavily compared to the play Pygmalion; the play served as the basis for the stage musical My Fair Lady, in which Andrews originated the role of main character Eliza Doolittle. Andrews explained that the film is as much \\"about what you are inside and the responsibility and just plain old hard work that goes into being a princess\\" as it is \\"about the trappings of being a princess\\". Hathaway identified \\"remaining true to yourself\\" among the film's core values, describing Mia's transformation as both emotional and psychological, in addition to physical. Hathaway elaborated that, despite the makeover, her character most importantly learns that \\"life shouldn't be about what the rest of the world can do for her\\" but rather \\"doing everything in her power to help other people\\", emphasizing her emotional transformation over her physical one. Chase regards the plot as an \\"empowerment story\\", identifying \\"the power to be anything that you want to be\\" as its core message. Chase elaborated, \\"In the beginning, Mia looks in the mirror and doesn't think she's princess material at all\\" but ultimately \\"comes to believe that she is\\". Houston echoed that being a princess \\"doesn't mean they have to come from royalty\\" but rather \\"how you feel inside about yourself it's how you treat yourself and love yourself that really matters.\\" Bustle contributor Veronica Walsingham wrote that the film explores feminism, identity, family, girlhood, and duty, believing that The Princess Diaries \\"is a feminist dream of fully developed female characters whose arcs aren't dependent on male characters\\", additionally passing the Bechdel test. A critic for Time Out wrote that the film discusses \\"responsibility, surrogacy, rites of passage and the value of friendship\\". Most of Marshall's films revolve around themes \\"of recognizing and embracing one's own unique qualities and gifts\\". The Globe and Mail's Liam Lacey observed that the film adheres to a traditional fairy tale plot: \\"a fairy godmother, and the lowly girl who becomes a princess, complete with tiara, the dress and a plump frog to be transformed into Prince Charming\\". The Princess Diaries has been noted to contain some romantic comedy elements. The film has also drawn comparisons to Pygmalion, a play that provided the basis for the stage musical My Fair Lady, in which Andrews coincidentally originated the role of Eliza Doolittle; Mia has been compared to Eliza. Identifying Pygmalion as \\"the model for all subsequent dramas about the recreation of social identity\\", The Guardian film critic Philip French cited The Princess Diaries as one of several \\"makeover drama[s]\\" inspired by the play. Similarly, HuffPost contributor Matthew recognized the film among several \\"recent approaches\\" to the Pygmalion story. Jacobs Kristal Brent Zook of The Washington Post wrote that Clarisse \\"must ... remake the gawky girl into a vision of regal grace\\" in \\"true Henry Higgins fashion\\", a character from My Fair Lady. The Seattle Times film critic Moira Macdonald joked that Andrews \\"play[s] Henry Higgins to young Anne Hathaway's Eliza\\". Also writing for The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan similarly observed that \\"Most of the comedy mileage comes from the My Fair Lady scenario, in which Mia's initially frumpy appearance and klutzy manner are eliminated through a regime of industrial-strength cosmetology and boot camp-style finishing school.\\" Nanciann Cherry, writing for The Blade, reviewed the film as \\"no more and no less than a live-action Cinderella, all dolled up for the 21st century\\". Amy Meadows, writing for The Tech, remarked that the film would hold few surprises for anyone who has seen Cinderella, My Fair Lady, or any other fairy tale. The film's main characters react differently towards Mia's physical transformation; Lilly fears that Mia will abandon her, Michael's attraction towards her only grows, and Lana feels threatened by Mia's royal lineage and sudden popularity within her own school. Some critics were concerned that the film's message might encourage younger viewers \\"that all awkward teens need do to find contentment is get a makeover and wait for a hitherto unknown royal grandmother to come lay a crown on their heads.\\" Music Houston and BrownHouse Productions were heavily involved in curating music for the film, which Kristal Brent Zook of The Washington Post observed \\"displays more girl power and ethnic flavor than the film does\\". Dawn Soler served as the film's music supervisor, and Moore recorded a cover of Connie Francis' \\"Stupid Cupid\\" for the soundtrack. Composer John Debney was recruited to score the film. Long-time friends with Disney executive Bill Green, Green felt that Debney would complement the film and personally recommended him to Marshall. Debney identified The Princess Diaries as one of the films he is most proud to have worked on, explaining that the project holds an \\"emotional connection\\" because it reminds him of his mother. The official soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 24, 2001. Described as largely a collection of pop rock, teen pop, and dance-pop tracks, the soundtrack features contributions from artists BBMak, Aaron Carter, Backstreet Boys, Myra, Hanson and B*Witched. AllMusic's Heather Phares reviewed that the album consists of mostly \\"slick, virtually interchangeable singles ... a few tracks, for better or worse, are particularly distinctive\\", and felt that the album could have benefited from more originality as the Backstreet Boys' track \\"What Makes You Different (Makes You Beautiful)\\" implies. A soundtrack consisting exclusively of the film's orchestral score was released on December 11, 2001, credited to Debney. Release Disney attempted to market the film cleverly to dispel the stigma associated with G-rated films at the time. The Princess Diaries premiered on July 29, 2001 at the El Capitan Theatre. Prior to introducing the film, Marshall encouraged audience members to chant \\"G is a good rating\\", deliberately referencing the lack of G-rated films released that year. A princess-themed tea party was hosted following the screening, with cast members Andrews, Hathaway, Matarazzo, Moore, Goodall, Schwartzman, Von Detten and Burbano attending. In addition to Jacobson, Disney executives Bob Iger, Richard Cook, Mark Vahradian, Chuck Viane and Oren Aviv were present, as well as actors Spencer Treat Clark, David Hasselhoff, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Michelle Trachtenberg. Additionally, the tea party featured appearances by actors portraying well-known Disney Princesses, including Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora and Belle. Disney postponed the release of The Other Side of Heaven, which Hathaway had filmed before The Princess Diaries, to allow the latter film to take precedence at the box office, feeling confident that The Princess Diaries' impending success would in turn bolster the performance of The Other Side of Heaven. The Princess Diaries was released in theaters on August 3, 2001, becoming a surprise success and sleeper hit. The film opened in 2,537 theaters throughout North America and earned more than $23.2 million during its opening weekend, completing in third place behind Rush Hour 2 and Planet of the Apes. The Princess Diaries achieved the second-highest opening earnings for a live-action G-rated film, behind 101 Dalmatians (1996) at $33.5 million. The film's box office returns surprised several commentators, far exceeding pundits' expectations. Analysts originally estimated that the film would earn between $13 and $15 million. The Princess Diaries was the only G-rated film released during summer 2001. According to Breuse Hickman of The Honolulu Advertiser, the last live-action film to earn a G-rating prior to The Princess Diaries was Disney's 101 Dalmatians in 1996, a live-action remake of their own 1961 animated film of the same name. ABC News believes that the comedy's strong opening numbers benefited from it being one of 2001's few G-rated releases amidst several of PG-13-and R-rated films, to which parents reportedly rushed to see with their children, while Allen Wan of MarketWatch joked that the family friendly rating \\"didn't scare off mature audiences\\". However, The Dove Foundation argued that family fare such as The Princess Diaries is typically 11 times more profitable than adult-oriented films, although 12 times as many R-rated films were released between 1989 and 2003. Dove Foundation CEO Dick Rolfe received the film's release as \\"an experiment to test the waters to see if there is a market for truly wholesome family entertainment at the theaters\\". The Princess Diaries ultimately grossed $165.3 million worldwide, collecting $108.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $57.1 million in other territories. The film's box office returns were deemed remarkably high considering the fact that its lead role was played by a newcomer. The film ranks among the highest-grossing and most profitable of 2001. To commemorate the film's 10th anniversary in April 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray to coincide with Disney's National Princess Week and the release of Andrews' book The Very Fairy Princess: Here Comes The Flower Girl!. A double-disk paired with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, the release was sold exclusively at Target. Critical response The Princess Diaries earned mixed reviews from film critics upon release. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 48% of 115 critics surveyed reviewed the film positively. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"A charming, if familiar, makeover movie for young teenage girls.\\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted score of 52 based on 27 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Ed Park, writing for The Village Voice, reviewed the film as \\"a modest, enjoyable fairy tale that easily outcharms its animated stablemates of the past decade\\", continuing, \\"The movie hits its timeworn marks with grace and wit, thanks to game gamine Hathaway and an effortlessly regal Andrews.\\" Calling The Princess Diaries \\"an ideal family film\\", Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times commended Marshall's ability to \\"mak[e] make-believe seem real\\" while describing Wendkos' screenplay as \\"skillfully adapted\\" and praising Andrews' performance. Awarding the film a B+, Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote that Marshall \\"directs Gina Wendkos' girl-wise script ... with avuncular affection and, by his standards, a minimum of court jestering, and he encourages moments of appropriate delirium among his large cast\\", highlighting Andrews and Oh's contributions and dubbing it a \\"charming ... production\\" that \\"gets the duckling-to-swan ambivalence just right\\".Anne Hathaway's performance in The Princess Diaries (her first film role) earned widespread acclaim from film critics, who cited her alt= Film critic Mick LaSalle, writing for SFGate, called the film superior to Marshall's Pretty Woman, going on to deem it \\"Marshall's best movie\\". Dubbing Clarisse \\"Andrews' best showcase in years\\", LaSalle credited most of the film's humor with Andrews' performance, specifically her reaction to Hathaway's gimmicks. The Washington Post film critic Michael O'Sullivan wrote that, despite the film's younger target demographic, \\"there's enough bile and phlegm souring up the sweet main story to appeal to even those of us with more mature tastes.\\" Although Christine Dolen of the Miami Herald believed Mia's clumsiness is \\"by far the most winning things about\\" the film, she felt that the script \\"leaves much to be desired  like an intriguing storyline, any semblance of believability or choices beyond the obvious\\". She ultimately credited Andrews and Hathaway's performances with saving the picture. Robert Koehler of Variety felt Marshall and Wendkos \\"waste the charming comic tone and observations of Cabot's book, especially ... where the reformation of Mia is depicted almost off-handedly\\". Koehler criticized the film for squandering comedic opportunities by focusing on Mia's school and romantic relationships as opposed to her grandmother's training. However, he felt Andrews and Elizondo were perfectly cast, and commended Hathaway's comedic instincts. The Globe and Mail's Liam Lacey agreed that \\"Surprisingly little time is spent mining the comic potential of Mia's education, with the comedy rationed in favour of a tiresome amount of attention lavished on her ongoing school problems\\", but concluded that Marshall deserves \\"credit for his keen sense of historical symmetry in the perfect casting of Julie Andrews\\". Praising the cast's chemistry, Loren King, writing for the Chicago Tribune, credited Andrews' performance with \\"kick[ing] the film's class quotient up several notches\\". Hathaway's performance was widely praised by film critics, as was her chemistry with Andrews. LaSalle wrote, \\"Hathaway is not a natural comic, but her acting has a truthfulness that gives The Princess Diaries its emotional core. She is also a chameleon, who, from the most unpromising of beginnings, blossoms before our eyes into near- Audrey Hepburn-level loveliness\\", additionally commending her chemistry with Matarazzo. Elvis Mitchell, film critic for The New York Times, found the film to be merely \\"a blandly reassuring comedy\\" but described it as perfectly cast, hailing Hathaway as \\"royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features\\". However, Mitchell felt that her character becomes less interesting once she undergoes her makeover and predicted that some viewers will find the sequence problematic. Similarly, The Seattle Times' Moira Macdonald felt that the film could have done without Mia's \\"teen-queen makeover, which made her look alarmingly like a junior Julia Roberts\\", but wrote that Andrews \\"tucks the film into her carpet bag and walks away with it\\", crowning her \\"pure screen royalty\\". Even the film's most staunch detractors enjoyed Hathaway's efforts, with several critics comparing Hathaway to a \\"young\\" Julia Roberts. Lacey felt Mia \\"does a reasonable impression of a fashion model going through a geek-chic phase\\", comparing her to Roberts and predicting her successful film career. Asher Price, reviewing for The Denver Post, lauded Andrews' contribution while identifying Hathaway as \\"a good match for\\" the veteran actress. Branding the film \\"a surprisingly sophisticated comedy\\" that avoids common teen tropes, Price enjoyed the training sequences but felt Mia's confidence is drawn solely from her physical transformation, describing the latter as \\"The only disturbing part of the film\\". Despite being unimpressed with his direction, the New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick commended Marshall for \\"showcas[ing] Hathaway‚Äôs star quality in a way that‚Äôs more than a little reminiscent of his most famous film, Pretty Woman\\" and praised Elizondo's contribution. ReelViews' James Berardinelli panned the film, accusing Marshall of exploring a predictable plot \\"in a thoroughly uninteresting way\\" by \\"reducing characters to types and heaping mounds of saccharine and false sentiment on top\\". Film critic Roger Ebert dismissed the film as a \\"swamp of recycled ugly duckling stories, with occasional pauses in the marsh of sitcom cliches and the bog of Idiot Plots\\", finding it predictable, poorly edited and Hathaway too physically attractive to offer a convincing transformation. Salon film critic Stephanie Zacharek reviewed the film as \\"so aggressively bland and inoffensive that it practically recedes from the screen\\". Zacharek is also one of the few film critics to deride the leads' performances, dismissing Andrews as \\"so shellacked and precise ... that it makes you want to run out of the theater and roll around in the dirt\\". Accolades The Princess Diaries won the Young Artist Award for Best Family Feature Film - Comedy. Debney's score won the ASCAP Award for Top Box Office Film, one of three awards the composer received at the 17th Film and Television Music Awards ceremony. Myra's song \\"Miracles Happen (When You Believe)\\" received an ALMA Award nomination for Outstanding Song in a Motion Picture Soundtrack. Casting directors Marcia Ross, Donna Morong and Gail Goldberg were nominated for an Artios Award for Feature Film Casting ‚Äì Comedy. At the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, The Princess Diaries was nominated for Best Family Film - Live Action. The film's trailer was nominated for a Golden Trailer Award for Best Animation/Family. Makeup artists Hallie D'Amore and Leonard Engelma were nominated for a Hollywood Makeup Artist Hair Stylist Guild Award for Best Contemporary Makeup - Feature. Hathaway received an MTV Movie Award nomination for Breakthrough Female Performance. The Princess Diaries was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards: Choice Movie: Actress, Comedy for Hathaway and Choice Movie: Comedy. Sequel A sequel, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, was released on August 11, 2004, with Garry Marshall returning to direct and Debra Martin Chase to produce the sequel. Unlike the first film, it is not based on any of the books. Most of the cast returned for the sequel, including Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, H√©ctor Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, and Larry Miller. New cast and characters include Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies), Lord Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine), and Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue). There has been constant speculation about whether or not a third film will be released for several years. Several cast members have expressed interest in returning for a third installment, particularly Hathaway and Andrews. In 2016, Marshall revealed that he had discussed the possibility of having a third film set in New York with both actresses. Interest has bolstered following Marshall's death in 2016, with Cabot revealing that a script for the third film already exists, indicating that the threequel would most likely be a tribute to Marshall. In January 2019, Hathaway confirmed there is a script being written for a third film and that she, Julie Andrews, and producer Debra Martin Chase are on board.  Legacy  Elite Daily contributor Alana Altmann described the film as \\"a bonafide fave of '90s and 2000s kids alike\\". Writing for the same publication, Kristen Perrone called the film \\"an essential part of the childhoods of anyone who grew up in the early 2000s\\". Andrews attributes the film's longevity to the notion that \\"every seven years ... There's always a new generation that can discover it.\\" The actress believes that the film continues to resonate with audiences \\"because it‚Äôs got a wonderful heart. It‚Äôs about responsibility and obligation and decency and growing up and discovering who you are inside.\\" Seventeen ranked The Princess Diaries the 10th best \\"Best Teen Movies You Can't Grow Up Without Watching\\". The scene in which Mia undergoes a physical makeover has garnered significant attention, with several media publications ranking it among the greatest makeover sequences in film history. E! contributor McKenna Aiello identified it as \\"the first scene that comes to mind\\" when one remembers The Princess Diaries, a sentiment with which InStyle agreed. Lauren Hubbard, writing for Allure, believes that the film \\"may very well be one of the single greatest makeover movies of our generation\\", publishing a list of \\"11 Beauty Lessons We Learned from The Princess Diaries\\". Cosmopolitan's Eliza Thompson wrote that \\"Few makeover movies hold up as well as The Princess Diaries\\". Katie Rosseinsky of Grazia credits the film with introducing audiences to \\"one of the best makeover sequences in teen movie history\\" while teaching \\"excellent life lessons\\". Ranking it second, Her Campus hailed the scene as \\"the best teenage makeover ever\\". Total Beauty ranked the sequence ninth, dubbing it the \\"Best Hair Movie Makeover\\", while video streaming service Netflix ranked the film among \\"Five Films That Have Amazing Makeovers\\". Bustle writer Veronica Walsingham believes that The Princess Diaries' makeover sequence distinguishes itself from similar scenes because \\"it's an actual makeover\\" involving a complete physical transformation, whereas several other films \\"feature a female character who is made over by ... taking off her glasses\\". The Ringer placed the scene seventh on their \\"Definitive Ranking of the Best Movie Makeovers\\", with author Andrew Gruttadaro calling Mia's final reveal from behind two photographs of her former self a highlight. When rumors of a third installment of the series were denied by Disney in 2015, Entertainment Weekly editor Isabella Biedenharn advised disappointed fans to seek comfort by watching the original film's makeup sequence. The sequence's popularity has resulted in makeover sequences becoming something of a trademark for Hathaway, whose characters have undergone similar transformations in subsequent films such as Ella Enchanted (2004), The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Les Mis√©rables (2012), with some media publications crowning her the \\"queen of makeover movies\\". The mint sorbet Mia consumes as a palate cleanser during the state dinner has frequently been commented upon in the media. Describing the dessert as \\"the element of the movie that has always stood out the most\\", Priya Krishna, a food writer for The Cut, reported that since the film's release, food bloggers have attempted to recreate the dessert and celebrities have commented upon it on social media, concluding, \\"nothing ... has been so simultaneously mystifying and fascinating to me as the palate cleanser in The Princess Diaries\\", crediting it with inspiring her career trajectory. Zimbio ranked the confection one of the \\"Top 20 Movie Desserts Of All Time\\". In her biography for Hathaway, Rebecca Flint Marx of AllMovie wrote that Hathaway \\"became a familiar face to millions of moviegoers thanks to her starring role in\\" The Princess Diaries by \\"prov[ing] her comedic timing\\" and in turn opening \\"a number of doors\\" for her as a performer. Hathaway suffered from being typecast in \\"good girl\\" roles in Hollywood, and struggled to pursue more serious, non-princess roles; this would inspire her to pursue a wider range of films as possible. Hathaway explained that \\"Because I became so associated with The Princess Diaries ... my main [criterion] is to look for the opposite of what I last did.‚Äù Hathaway commemorates the film's release date every year, thanking \\"the universe ... because that was the day that dreams came true for me\\". Marie Claire ranked The Princess Diaries Hathaway's second greatest film performance, describing the \\"SHUT UP\\" her character utters upon discovering she's a princess as iconic. The website NewNowNext credits The Princess Diaries with beginning to establish Hathaway as a gay icon, comparing her debut as a \\"reluctant princess\\" to that of actress Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday (1953). The film is credited with reviving Andrews' film career and introducing her to a younger generation of fans, rivaling her career-defining performances in Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music (1965) in terms of popularity. The film's popularity is credited with \\"catapult[ing] Cabot from writer to celebrity\\". Cabot remarked that the novels had actually been intended for slightly older readers, but parents who saw the G-rated film would purchase the books for their 6-7-year-old children, unintentionally exposing them to teen content. When Marshall died in July 2016, several cast members paid tribute to the late director online. Following Marshall's death, The Daily Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin wrote that The Princess Diaries is \\"by no means a flawless movie\\", but rather \\"one from which a star was able to bounce out, eyes bright, teeth flashing and primed for adoration. Marshall‚Äôs films may never have made him a critical darling, but his best work thrived on smile power ‚Äì on both the faces of his audience and cast.\\" When the film was released on Netflix in 2018, the streaming service tweeted their surprise at the revelation that Houston served as a producer on the film, inspiring several Twitter users to comment the same. The film's popularity among audiences has since defied expectations initially indicated by its lukewarm reception nearly two decades after its release. Observing that the film experienced a renaissance in 2018, Walsingham credits the film's resurgence to its release on Netflix and American actress Meghan Markle's marriage to Prince Harry, whose narrative has been compared to Mia's role in The Princess Diaries in the media, particularly the fact that Markle underwent \\"duchess training\\" for the title.

Biography He was born at Norwich, the son of Robert Woodhouse, linen draper, and educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, (BA 1795) of which society he was subsequently a fellow.Harvey W. Becher (1980) \\"Woodhouse, Babbage, Peacock and Modern Algebra\\", Historia Mathematica 7(4): 389‚Äì400 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1802. His earliest work, entitled the Principles of Analytical Calculation, was published at Cambridge in 1803. In this he explained the differential notation and strongly pressed the employment of it; but he severely criticised the methods used by continental writers, and their constant assumption of non-evident principles. In 1809 Woodhouse published a textbook covering planar trigonometry and spherical trigonometry and the next year a historical treatise on the calculus of variations and isoperimetrical problems. He next produced an astronomy; of which the first book (usually bound in two volumes), on practical and descriptive astronomy, was issued in 1812, and the second book, containing an account of the treatment of physical astronomy by Pierre-Simon Laplace and other continental writers, was issued in 1818. He became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1820, and subsequently the Plumian professor in the university. As Plumian Professor he was responsible for installing and adjusting the transit instruments and clocks at the Cambridge Observatory.Woodhouse, R. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Vol.115 (1825) pp.418‚Äì428. He held that position until his death in 1827. A man like Woodhouse, of scrupulous honour, universally respected, a trained logician and with a caustic wit, was well fitted to introduce a new system; and the fact that when he first called attention to the continental analysis he exposed the unsoundness of some of the usual methods of establishing it, more like an opponent than a partisan, was as politic as it was honest. Woodhouse did not exercise much influence on the majority of his contemporaries, and the movement might have died away for the time being if it had not been for the advocacy of George Peacock, Charles Babbage, and John Herschel, who formed the Analytical Society, with the object of advocating the general use in the university of analytical methods and of the differential notation. On his death in Cambridge he was buried in Caius College Chapel.

It was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Sunrise, which was broadcast on NHK from October 2003 through April 2004. The story revolves around the crew of the debris collection craft, Toy Box, in the year 2075. The manga was published in English in North America by Tokyopop, and the anime was distributed in North America by Bandai Entertainment. Both the manga and anime received the Seiun Award for best science fiction series. Plot The story of Planetes follows the crew of the DS-12 \\"Toy Box\\" of the Space Debris Section, a unit of Technora Corporation. Debris Section's purpose is to prevent the damage or destruction of satellites, space stations and spacecraft from collision with debris (so-called \\"space debris\\") in Earth's and the Moon's orbits. They use a number of methods to dispose of the debris (mainly by burning it via atmospheric reentry or through salvage), accomplished through the use of EVA suits. The story sometimes revolves around debris collection itself, but more often the concept of collecting \\"trash\\" in space is merely a storytelling method for building character development. The members of the Debris Section are looked down upon as the lowest members of the company and they must work hard to prove their worth to others and accomplish their dreams. Ongoing plot elements include an upcoming exploratory mission to Jupiter on the new fusion powered ship, Von Braun, and the lead character's decision to join the mission, no matter the cost. Many other plot threads are also developed throughout the series that help to explain each character's motivations and personalities. The Space Defense Front is a terrorist organization that believes mankind is exploiting space without first curing global problems such as mass famine and the widened socio-economic divide on Earth.Planetes Ep. 12 Realism Technical The story of Planetes takes place in the near future. Special care was given in Planetes for a very realistic depiction of space and space travel. For instance, when in a weightless environment, the frame count dramatically increases in order to make weightless motion more fluid and realistic. Also, spaceships make no noise in the vacuum of space and astronauts routinely suffer from known space illnesses such as radiation poisoning, decompression sickness, cancer, brittle bones and mental illnesses spawned from isolation in the vacuum of space. But in an example of a non- scientific idea, one character, born on the Moon, grew to be abnormally tall due to the lesser lunar gravity, looking like an adult at the age of 12. Concepts like momentum in weightlessness are early plot points and are always illustrated naturally. Director Goro Taniguchi stated in the DVD commentary that he learned much about orbital mechanics in the course of making the series. This can be shown in showing specific orbital energy, through changing orbits by applying thrust throughout the series.Episode 1 Cast and Directors' Commentary Even the necessity for the retrieval of space debris that is central to the plot is rooted in the serious and growing problem with space debris today. The show also works to connect itself to the history of rocketry and space flight. The opening sequence is similar to the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, featuring a montage of the history of space flight from Greek mythology to the \\"modern\\" setting outlined in the series. Along the way, animated images of important milestones in space travel like Robert Goddard's early rocket tests, the V-2 rocket, Sputnik 1, Laika the dog, the Vostok spacecraft, Apollo 11, Skylab, Mir, the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle Endeavour and other milestones are displayed. References to early pioneers in rocketry like Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Robert H. Goddard, Wernher von Braun and Hermann Oberth are also made regularly.The Werner Locksmith character in particular seems to reflect both Von Braun's vision for the future as well as his willingness to resort to questionable means to achieve them. The Japanese space agency JAXA served as a technical consultant to the series.JAXA is credited for technical advice at the end of the credits of the anime. The US version of the DVDs featured interviews with two scientists from NASA's Orbital Debris Section. However, both scientists stated that the premise of having to rendezvous with debris in orbit is highly unlikely as it would take an extravagant amount of energy for a relatively small amount of salvageable material.Planetes Vol. 2, supplementary DVD, NASA Orbital Debris Section interview. One of the scientists stated that the previous director of the NASA Orbital Debris Section was in fact Donald J. Kessler, the scientist who proposed the eponymous Kessler Syndrome, which is cited and used several times in both the anime and manga. Human elements The story also depicts the richer countries monopolizing resources in space and the poorer ones falling into civil war and being invaded or needing the assistance of those richer countries, telling a story of dependency theory and the negative side of environmentalism.Planetes Ep. 18: Mananga, a third world country, fell into civil war when their oil exports were superseded by environmentally cleaner energy found in space. The conflicting views of the terrorist group, the Space Defense Front, who wish to shut human beings off from space, the main characters who believe in the importance of space exploration and development,Planetes Ep. 7: Fee: \\"Nothing can be solved by locking yourself up in a warm place, how could the world continue without space resources?\\" and the International Treaty Organization (INTO) which wants space development primarily to serve the economic and military needs of developed nations also play major roles.Planetes Ep. 24: Conversation between INTO officials during negotiations. The anime refrains from oversimplification of the various factions, portraying both true believers and those with ulterior motives on all sides.Planetes Ep. 24: SDF rebels on the Moon are stunned at being abandoned when their leadership strikes a deal with INTO on space resource distribution. The final settlement of the conflict is also unique in that it is not resolved by any of the main protagonists or antagonists, but by a compromise struck between powers above their heads.Planetes Ep. 24: Goro attempts to break into the hacked system but the system is restored without his intervention. Both the anime and manga set a precedent of portraying a highly multicultural cast of characters. Usually, characters who refer to anime stereotypes are immediately berated by other characters.Planetes Ep. 6: Lunar Flying Squirrels ask Hachi if he has a black belt, since he is Japanese. Hachi denies this outright and berates them. Themes The themes in Planetes are philosophical, sociological, and political in nature. *The theme most prevalent within the plot is the relationship between space, humanity, and the individual. Hachimaki struggles throughout the story with his own relationship with space and consequently, other people. *Existential dread (or angst) and the characters' response to it is an important part to their characterization. The characters' response to angst, particularly the protagonist Hachimaki, becomes a source of both internal and external conflict throughout the story. *Both the manga and the anime criticize artificial divisions, including political divisions within humanity, as well as divisions between nations,Planetes Ep. 11: \\"From here, we can't see any borders!\\" individuals,Planetes anime: Much of the latter half of the anime deals with Hachimaki cutting himself off from the others. and class divisions.Planetes Ep. 26: Claire mentions she wasn't very good at being an aristocrat. *In the anime, several characters were introduced in order to add its criticism of salaryman culture. Some of these characters are portrayed only to seek to climb the corporate ladder, however unlikely it may be. This fact makes several characters lose sight of the importance of their job, however lowly others might see it. At the same time, several characters are introduced who seek to work within the system in order to make a difference.Planetes Ep. 26: Having expanded his influence within Technora Corporation, Dolf decides to defy the board in favor of steering the company towards the ideals he started out with. *More generally, the series examines the difference between greed and ambition. The purpose and consequences of space exploration are seen both as they relate to humanity as a whole, and how they relate to the Hoshino family in particular. For humanity, space exploration holds the promise of increased wealth and prosperity. However, as the most wealthy nations are the only ones that can develop space, they are the only ones who end up reaping the benefits. Similarly, the protagonist, Hachirota Hoshino, initially wants to go faster and farther than he ever has before, yet as a result he nearly destroys both himself, and his relationships with others. Hachi's father, Goro Hoshino, is also caught between the two, having spent many years away from his wife and children so that he could explore space. Lastly, Hachi's younger brother, Kyutaro Hoshino, is obsessed with building rockets, either to make a name for himself, to upstage his brother, or to gain more attention and respect from his family, even if this occasionally results in putting their lives in danger when one of his rockets flies out of control. Production Though author/illustrator Makoto Yukimura does not have a background in the sciences, the idea of Planetes came to him while reading a book called A Garbage Problem in Space: Space Debris, and found the Japanese phonetics for the word debris () amusing. Yukimura intentionally did not research space technology for fears that it would compromise his artistic freedom. The presentation of technology in the anime adaptation broke from the manga in several areas, such as with the inclusion of touch-controlled HUDs, retractable debris face shields with a video screen, and peripheral cameras to the EVA suits the main characters use. Also, the anime introduces refinements in the weightless living and working spaces, with foot and hand bars for people to stabilize their movement in a weightless environment. The base of operations of Toy Box is moved from the Moon to a space station called the ISPV 7 in Low Earth Orbit. The United States of America is explicitly named in the manga, as opposed to in the anime where it is seldom mentioned in favor of \\"INTO\\" or the International Treaty Organization (a possible reference to NATO and SEATO), which seems to be a federation of individual countries including the United States and Japan. Planetes shared part of its production staff with another anime series that ran at the same time on NHK, Twin Spica. From this, the production staff slipped several easter egg cross overs into Planetes. Some of these include: *The hotel on the ISPV 7 Space Station is called the Hotel Spica. *Episode 20 of the Planetes anime featured an isolation test which mirrored the isolation test which was part of the National Space Academy entrance test in Twin Spica. *Inflated spherical escape pods, or \\"rescue balls\\" are featured in both series at some point. There are several times where the anime and the manga would allude to each other. The following are some examples of this: *\\"Nora\\", Technora Corporation's mascot in the anime is originally Hachimaki's alien friend who appeared in a dream. *The white cat the SDF used as an avatar in the anime to talk to the Union conference delegates in episode 23 is Hachimaki's vision of God during his vision quest on the Lunar surface. *In episode 22, the Debris Section Office Staff visit the Moon Debris Section office and find that the office staff there is very similar to them. This is a reference to the fact that the Toy Box and its crew were based on the Moon in the manga. *In a non-canon yonkoma gag strip in the manga, Tanabe is defeated in volleyball by Claire (who only appears in the anime). However, Claire's face is not seen, as she states that the cartoonist \\"Isn't confident enough to draw me\\". Media Manga Written and illustrated by Makoto Yukimura, the twenty-six chapters appeared as a serial in the Kodansha seinen manga magazine Weekly Morning from January 1999 to January 2004. Kodansha collected the chapters into four tank≈çbon volumes, and published them from January 23, 2001, to February 23, 2004. It was licensed for an English-language translation in North America by Tokyopop. It published the series in five volumes by splitting the last volume in two parts from October 7, 2003, to February 8, 2005. The translation was rereleased in two omnibus volumes by Dark Horse Comics on December 22, 2015, and May 10, 2016. Anime The anime adaptation of Planetes began airing its 26-episode run on NHK BS-2 on October 4, 2003, and ended on February 23, 2004. Produced and animated by Sunrise, it was directed by Gor≈ç Taniguchi and scripted by Ichir≈ç ≈åkouchi. The anime began development and production before the end of the manga serialization. In the beginning and middle of the series, the writing and production staff only had the first three volumes of the manga as source. In order to fill the entire 26-episode run of the anime, new characters, new settings and new relationships between characters were made in order to increase dramatic tension, reinforce themes introduced in the manga, and introduce new themes that were compatible with the manga. While the manga deals more with existential themes, and humanity's relationship with space, the anime further expands the political elements of the story. The music score was composed by K≈çtar≈ç Nakagawa and produced by Victor Entertainment. The opening theme is \\"Dive in the Sky\\" by Mikio Sakai, and the ending themes are \\"Wonderful Life\\" by Mikio Sakai for episodes 1-25 and \\"Planetes\\" by Hitomi Kuroishi for episode 26. There are two insert songs, \\"A Secret of the Moon\\" by Hitomi Kuroishi, used in various episodes, and \\"Thanks My Friend\\" by Mikio Sakai used in episode 13. Reception Both the manga and the anime were critically acclaimed. According to Anime News Network, the manga has a \\"solid, engrossing storyline and well-developed characters\\". Anime News Network also proclaimed Planetes to be the best science fiction anime series of 2005. Both the manga and anime received the Seiun Award for best science fiction series, the manga in 2002 and the anime in 2005. In terms of sales, the manga was only a modest success in North America, with volume 3 reaching 81st place on the Diamond US sales top 100, selling about 1100 copies through the distributor. Volume 4 reached 93rd place, selling about 1400 copies.

The location is famous for the abundant and exceptionally preserved insect and plant fossils that are found in the mudstones and shales of the Florissant Formation. Based on argon radiometric dating, the formation is Eocene (approximately 34 million years old McIntosh, W. C. et al (1992). Calibration of the Latest Eocene-Oligocene geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale Using 40Ar/39Ar Dated Ignimbrites. Geology, v. 20, p. 459-463) in age and has been interpreted as a lake environment. The fossils have been preserved because of the interaction of the volcanic ash from the nearby Thirtynine Mile volcanic field with diatoms in the lake, causing a diatom bloom. As the diatoms fell to the bottom of the lake, any plants or animals that had recently died were preserved by the diatom falls. Fine layers of clays and muds interspersed with layers of ash form \\"paper shales\\" holding beautifully-preserved fossils. History The name Florissant comes from the French word for flowering. In the late 19th century tourist and excavators came to this location to observe the wildlife and collect samples for collections and study. The Petrified Forest, that is now one of the main attractions at the monument today, lost much of its mass due to collectors removing large amounts of petrified wood from the site.Meyer, H.W. Fossils of Florissant. Washington D.C. Smithsonian Books. 2003 During the 1860s and 1870s the area was mapped by geologists for the first time. Paleontologists followed soon after to collect fossils for research.Veach, S. W., Meyer, H.W. (2008). History of Paleontology at the Florissant Fossil Beds, Colorado. Geological Society of America, Special Paper 435, p. 1-18 In 1969, the Florissant Fossil Bed National Monument was established after a long legal battle between local land owners and the federal government. Today, the park receives approximately 60,000 visitors a year, and is the site of ongoing paleontological investigations.Meyer, H. W. & Weber, L. (1995). Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument: Preservation of an Ancient Ecosystem. Rocks and Minerals, v. 70, p. 232-239 Geology 2013 aerial photo In the late Eocene to early Oligocene, approximately 34 million years ago, the area was a lake environment with redwood trees. The basement is the Proterozoic aged Pikes Peak Granite. There is an unconformity from the Pikes Peak Granite to the next unit, the Wall Mountain tuff.Foos, A. & Hannibal, J. (1999). Geology of the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument. Field Guide, 9 pages The massive unconformity is due to erosion that occurred during the uplift of the modern Rocky Mountains, the Laramide Orogeny.Steven, T. A. (1997). Middle and Late Cenozoic Tectonic and Geomorphic Development of the Front Range of Colorado. Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, 1997, Colorado Front Range Guide Book, p. 115-125 The Wall Mountain Tuff was deposited as a result of a large eruption from a distant caldera. The Florissant Formation itself is composed of alternating units of shale, mudstone, conglomerate, and volcanic deposits. There are six described units within the Florissant Formation: the lower shale unit, lower mudstone unit, middle shale unit, caprock conglomerate unit, upper shale unit, and the upper pumice unit. Each of the shale units represents lacustrine environments, composed of very thin shales that are abundant in fossils, which alternate with tuffs from eruptions. The lower mudstone has been interpreted as a stream environment with the top of the unit being a lahar deposit. The mudstones were deposited on a valley floor, but not in a lake. The separation of the shale units by non-lake deposits could mean that there were two generations of lake deposits. Lahars that went through the valley could have dammed up the valley, allowing for the creation of a lake. The middle and upper shale units were then deposited in this second generation of the lake. The caprock conglomerate was deposited as a large lahar went through the valley and accumulated down on the lake floor. The Laramide Orogeny, which created the modern Rocky Mountains, had been uplifting the area to the west since the end of the Cretaceous,Dickinson, W. R. et al (1988). Paleogeographic and Paleotectonic Setting of the Laramide Sedimentary Basins in the Central Rocky Mountain Region, Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 100, p. 1023-1039 although the exact timing of the orogeny is debated In the late Eocene to the Early Oligocene, volcanic episodes began to occur to the southwest of the Florissant area. These episodes of eruption would deposit ash and other volcanic debris on the Florissant location, and the volcanic material would be one of the most important factors in the fossilization of the plants and animals that are so abundant in the formation. The fossil bearing paper shales are intercalated with larger deposits of volcanic material.Harding, I. C., & Chant, L. S. (2000). Self-Sedimented Diatom Mats as Agents of Exceptional Fossil Preservation in the Oligocene Florissant Lake Beds, Colorado, United States. Geology (Boulder), 28(3), 195-198. Most of the rocks that were deposited after the Oligocene and before the Pleistocene have been eroded away.Chapin, C. E., & Cather, S. M. (1983). Eocene Tectonics and Sedimentation in the Colorado Plateau, Rocky mountain Association of Geologists, p. 33-54Gregory, K. M., & Chase, C. G. (1992). Tectonic significance of paleobotanically estimated climate and altitude of the late eocene erosion surface, Colorado. Geology (Boulder), 20(7), 581-585 Most of the remaining units are composed of clasts of weathered Pikes Peak Granite, volcanics, and mud that were transported by streams that flowed through the area. Some mammoth bones have been found within these units and have been dated to around 50,000 years old. Thirtynine Mile Volcanic Field Around 25-30 kilometers to the southwest, a series of stratovolcanoes, similar to modern day volcanoes like Mt. St Helens, developed and erupted periodically. Called the Guffey volcanic center, within the larger Thirtynine Mile volcanic field, the volcano would have eruptions that included domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic events.Chapin, C. E., & Epis, R. C. (1964). Some Stratigraphic and Structural Features of the Thirtynine Mile Volcanic Field, Central Colorado. The Mountain Geologist, V. 1, p. 145-159Wobus, R. A. et al. (1990). Geochemistry of high-potassium rocks from the mid-Tertiary Guffey volcanic center, Thirtynine Mile volcanic field, central Colorado, Geology, V. 18, No 7, p. 642-445 Ash from these events would be deposited throughout the area and lahars would flow down the valleys. The ash that settled would create the tuff, and the lahars would form the mudstones and the conglomerates that are found in the Florissant formation. The Florissant was deposited in a paleovalley after one of the lahars dammed the paleovalley. The resulting lake would become as large as 36 km2. There were two cycles of lake environments. The first one created the lower shale unit, while the second lake would create the middle and upper shale units. Eventually, the volcanoes became dormant and started to erode away. Over time, the volcanoes became so eroded that there are no more obvious signs of them on the surface. Instead, the Eocene erosional surface is the only remnants of the volcanoes that permeated the area. Fossils One of the large petrified stumps at Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument Florissant Fossil Beds. 2012. National Park Service. 5 November 2012. http://www.nps.gov/flfo/index.htm Fossilized cocoa flower Ironically, the volcanic material that caused so much destruction led to the preservation of the fossils within the Florissant Formation's shales and mudstones. As the ash was deposited on the landscape, it was carried by water through streams and lahars to the lake. The lahars then covered the base of the redwoods that were living at the time, and the trunks of the trees became harder and fossilized. Through permineralization, the precipitates that were in the ground water flowed through the tree trunks, replacing the original matter with siliceous minerals, replacing the organic matter with silica. This process of mineralization led to the preservation of the stumps of the trees. Within the lake itself, the volcanic deposits were periodically deposited into the lake either through direct deposition or though weathering. The volcanic material was rich in silica. Living in the lake at the time were diatoms, whose shells were also composed of silica. The influx of more silica caused the diatoms to bloom in the lake. As the population of the diatoms massively increased, the stress from the volcanic episodes at the same time caused large die-offs of the local biota. As the plants and animals died off, their leaves and bodies fell into the lake and eventually large amounts of organic matter accumulated at the bottom of the lake. This process was repeated often, possibly yearly, as the runoff from rain collected in the lake, causing cyclical diatom blooms and die-offs. The diatom blooms and die-offs created layers of ash-clay deposits, called couplets, resulting in many thin layers. Each microlayer of ash and clay was compacted by overlaying sediments to create \\"paper shales\\" (usually between 0.1 and 1.0 mm thick). Within these paper shales the best preserved fossils can be found in the formation. Based on this information, it has been estimated that the lake could have lasted 2,500 to 5,000 years, if the diatom couplets represent annual cycles.

File:Petrified Stump P6010856.JPGRedwood stump with young pine. Paleoflora Fossilised leaf preserved in fine detailThere is a large diversity of plants in the beds of the Florissant Formation, ranging from large redwoods to microscopic pollen. The Petrified Forest is one of the main tourist attractions at the monument. It is estimated that around 30 stumps are preserved. They are among the largest petrified stumps in the world. The majority of the stumps have been identified as similar to modern sequoias, or redwoods. These trees could have been as tall as 60 meters (= 198 feet) until they were killed by lahars suffocating the oxygen supply to their roots. By looking at the tree rings, some of the trees have been estimated to be 500‚Äì700 years old when they died. Some of the stumps belong to angiosperms. The Florissant Formation is also known for its fossilized leaves and the impressions they made. There are also specimens of fruits, seeds, cones, and flowers, which are all preserved in the paper shales of the formation. Most of the leaves come from trees and shrubs. Angiosperms are the dominant paleoflora, but there are also conifers present. Some of the cones, foliage, and pollen have been identified as coming from the sequoias. There are distinct differences in the fossilized sequoia material to the modern redwoods of California. The foliage in the fossils is thinner and the female cones are smaller than the modern examples. There have been more than 130 species of pollen that have been identified in the shale beds at Florissant. These species represent samples from many different habitats that were located near and around the lake, as well as farther up the valley. Benthic diatoms are the dominant type of siliceous algae found in the beds. These are easy to fossilize due to their silica shells. During periods of volcanism, the influxes of silica from volcanic ash lead to blooms of algae, which lead to algal mats and the exceptional preservation of the fossils. Florissant is significant in that it is one of the earliest known examples of freshwater diatoms. Fauna The majority of the animal fossils found at Florissant are invertebrates, but many specimens of vertebrates have been found. With such a large number of species identified in this location, it becomes apparent that the environment was ideal for a large range of animals to survive in the area. The great preservation of these animals gives insight into the environment that they survived in, as well as some aspects of their behavior. Invertebrates The invertebrate fossils of the Florissant are arthropods, such as spiders, millipedes, insects, and ostracods; and mollusks such as clams and snails. Of these, the most significant seem to be the spiders and insects, of which over 1,500 species have been identified in the fossil beds. Palaeovespa florissantia, a fossil wasp, forms the logo for Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument Arachnids are well represented in the Florissant, mostly a large variety of spiders. There have also been possible examples of harvestmen and daddy long-legs. There may be some evidence for gall mites, but no fully identified body fossils of them have been discovered yet. One unusual aspect of the spiders found in the formation is that they are not found with their legs curled in, but instead they are fully extended. This could indicate that they died in warmer temperature or acidic waters.Thoene, J., Dena, M., Cesar, R., & Herbert, W. (2012). Depositional setting and fossil insect preservation; a study of the late eocene florissant formation, colorado. Palaios, 27(7), 481-488. The insects that are found in the ash-clay beds are diverse and numerous. Mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies, grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, cockroaches, termites, earwigs, web- spinners, cicadas, snake flies, lacewings, beetles, flies, mosquitoes, butterflies, moths, wasps, bees, ants, and other insects have all been found in the Florissant.Moe, A. P., & Smith, D. M. (2005). Using pre-Quaternary diptera as indicators of paleoclimate. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 221(3-4), 203-214. Of these, the beetles are the most diverse and dominate in amount of specimens found as fossils. About 38% of the specimens found in the fossil beds are varieties of beetle. These fossils are aquatic and terrestrial insects, giving insight into the ecology and biology of the area. Ostracods are believed to have fed on algae on the bottom of the lake. Most of the fossil examples of ostracod come from the preserved carapaces, or feeding appendages. Only one species of ostracods has been described so far. Several freshwater mollusks have been identified, including freshwater and terrestrial. The most abundant mollusk that has been identified at Florissant is gastropods (snails). Vertebrates The vertebrate fossils in the Florissant are predominantly small fragments of incomplete bones. There have been a few described species of vertebrates, mostly fish, but also birds and mammals. The fish discovered at the site include bowfins, suckers, catfishes, and pirate perches. Most of these were bottom dwellers, except the perches, and many were tolerant of poor water conditions. Most of the fish have been found in the same shale layers versus other shale layers. This could indicate that there were more tolerable times for fish populations over the history of the lake than other times. Three examples of birds have been found in the beds, including a cuckoo. Most of the skeleton was lost, but there were still enough diagnostic features to identify the bird. There are also examples of rollers and shorebirds. Other birds were described in early literature from the 19th century, but the exact identification of these samples cannot be done due to lack of information. Mammals are almost non- existent in the shales, with only one specimen of a small opossum being discovered so far. In the lower mudstone units, there are samples of broken bones of a horse, a brontothere, and an oreodont. The horse would have been small, about as large as a medium-sized dog, with three toes on each foot. All this information is based on a complete lower jaw. The largest mammal that has been discovered so far is a brontothere, an elephant-sized animal with a pair of thick horns on the top of its head. All of this information is based on fragmented vertebrae and small pieces of tooth enamel. The oreodont, is an extinct family that resembles modern sheep and pigs. The only oreodont specimen is a jaw fragment. Other mammals have been described in the formation based on teeth specimens. In all, around a dozen mammalian taxa have been discovered and described in the Florissant.Worley-Georg, M., & Eberle, J. J. (2006). Additions to the chadronian mammalian fauna, florissant formation, florissant fossil beds national monument, colorado. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 26(3), 685-696 Surprisingly, no reptiles or amphibians have been recorded from Florissant, where they would have been expected. No explanation for the lack has been proposed, given the nearly 40,000 specimens from this location held by museums. The toxicity of the water due to volcanic activity could be to blame, but there are documented cases of aquatic animals in the lake. Paleoclimate Fossil plants, and in particular their leaves, have been the most useful sources of information of paleoclimate during the time of deposition of the Florissant Formation. Plants have a smaller tolerance on average to climatic changes, whereas many animals can be mobile and respond to rapid seasonal or daily changes.Larsen, D. (2000) Upper Eocene and Oligocene Lacustrine Deposits of the Southwestern United States, with Emphasis on the Creede and Florissant Formations. AAPG Studies in Geology, v. 46, p. 425-438 Comparing fossil plants and leaves to modern analogs enables inferences about the climate to be made based on physiological and morphological similarities. One of the best ways to do this is by studying the characteristics of the leaves that have been found. By looking at the physiognomy, or analysis of gross appearance based on climatic factors, the mean average temperature (or MAT) has been estimated to be around 13 ¬∞C, much warmer than the modern MAT at Florissant of 4 ¬∞C. There have also been estimates that the MAT was between 16-18 ¬∞C, based on comparisons to the closest living relatives of the plants. There are also indications that the seasonal changes in the area were not as great as what is seen in modern times. Estimates of MAT, based on pollen, have put the temperature as high as 17.5 ¬∞C, but pollen is arguably less diagnostic than leaves. . Based on the small size and the features of the teeth, the precipitation during the late Eocene to early Oligocene has been estimated to be around 50-80 centimeters per year, with a distinct dry season. This is much wetter than the average 38 cm that falls in the area during modern times. Most of the precipitation would have come in the late spring to early summer, with the rare snowfall in the winter. Tree-ring analysis indicates that the environment that the redwoods grew in during the time of sediment deposition would have been even more favorable than the current climate that the redwoods in California grow in. The average ring width, one year of growth, is larger than the width of redwoods in central California. Towards the end of the Eocene, the global temperature began to decrease. However, this episode of global cooling is not indicated in the fossil record at Florissant. Paleohabitats The fossilized algae and aquatic angiosperms indicate that the lake was freshwater and shallow. Near the streams and shore, moisture was plentiful, allowing lush vegetation to grow. However, further up the hillsides was more dry-adapted vegetation. At the base of the valley, trees (such as sequoias) dominated the landscape. The understory of this forest would have been composed of smaller trees and shrubs. There would have been a gradual transition between the different habitats from the base of the valley up the hillsides, with some overlap between the two. Insects from the area indicate different habitats as well. There are exclusively aquatic insects, such as dragonflies, that would have lived their entire lives on or near the lake. Meanwhile, the bees and butterflies would have preferred more open spaces in the surrounding hillsides and meadows. Paleoaltitude Early estimates of the elevation of the Florissant beds was determined to be between 300‚Äì900 meters, much lower than the modern elevation of 2,500-2,600 meters. However, more recent estimates that are based on paleoflora have put the elevation in the Eocene much higher. Ranges from 1,900 to 4,100 meters have been proposed. This would indicate that global climate change, rather than tectonic uplift, would be the main cause of changing environments in the area. The actual elevation of the Florissant area during the Eocene is still being determined. While most of the analysis using paleoflora has the area at a higher elevation than modern times, there is evidence that the elevation was as low as the earlier estimates.Meyer, H. W. (2007).

However, as with its viability as an ore, the solubility of the mineral causes significant problems. First, the mineral readily absorbs and releases its water content, which, over time, leads to a disintegration of the crystal structure, destroying even the finest specimens. It is critical to store specimens properly to limit exposure to humidity. Second, higher quality crystals can be easily grown synthetically, and, as such, there is a concern that disreputable mineral dealers would present a sample as natural when it is not.  Associated minerals  Given that chalcanthite is found in oxidized copper deposits, it is frequently found in association with other copper minerals. Frequently associated minerals include: * Calcite and its polymorph, aragonite, both Ca * Brochantite, Cu4()()6 * Chalcopyrite, CuFeS2 * Malachite, Cu2()()2 * Melanterite, Fe  Notes for identification  Chalcanthite's blue color is one of its most notable features, but it is insufficient in identification. Other useful tests include associated minerals, crystal habit, solubility and subsequent coloring of the water blue. Chalcanthite can also dye materials blue when dissolved in water, and has a peculiarly sweet and metallic taste, although consuming it can induce dangerous copper poisoning. thumbleft350pxCrystal structure of chalcanthite Color code: :Copper, Cu: brown :Sulfur, S: olive :Oxygen, O: red :Cell: cyan See also *Copper(II) sulfate  References  * Mineral Galleries Category:Hydrates Category:Copper(II) minerals Category:Sulfate minerals Category:Triclinic minerals ","title":"Chalcanthite"},{"id":"565031","text":"Particle displacement or displacement amplitude is a measurement of distance of the movement of a sound particle from its equilibrium position in a medium as it transmits a sound wave. The SI unit of particle displacement is the metre (m). In most cases this is a longitudinal wave of pressure (such as sound), but it can also be a transverse wave, such as the vibration of a taut string. In the case of a sound wave travelling through air, the particle displacement is evident in the oscillations of air molecules with, and against, the direction in which the sound wave is travelling. A particle of the medium undergoes displacement according to the particle velocity of the sound wave traveling through the medium, while the sound wave itself moves at the speed of sound, equal to in air at . Mathematical definition  Particle displacement, denoted Œ¥, is given by :\\\\mathbf \\\\delta = \\\\int_{t} \\\\mathbf v\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t where v is the particle velocity. Progressive sine waves The particle displacement of a progressive sine wave is given by :\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, t) = \\\\delta \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi_{\\\\delta, 0}), where *Œ¥ is the amplitude of the particle displacement; *\\\\varphi_{\\\\delta, 0} is the phase shift of the particle displacement; *k is the angular wavevector; *œâ is the angular frequency. It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave x are given by :v(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, t) = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, t)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\omega \\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi_{\\\\delta, 0} + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right) = v \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi_{v, 0}), :p(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, t) = -\\\\rho c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, t)}{\\\\partial x} = \\\\rho c^2 k_x \\\\delta \\\\cos\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi_{\\\\delta, 0} + \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right) = p \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\varphi_{p, 0}), where *v is the amplitude of the particle velocity; *\\\\varphi_{v, 0} is the phase shift of the particle velocity; *p is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure; *\\\\varphi_{p, 0} is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure. Taking the Laplace transforms of v and p with respect to time yields :\\\\hat{v}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s) = v \\\\frac{s \\\\cos \\\\varphi_{v,0} - \\\\omega \\\\sin \\\\varphi_{v,0}}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2}, :\\\\hat{p}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s) = p \\\\frac{s \\\\cos \\\\varphi_{p,0} - \\\\omega \\\\sin \\\\varphi_{p,0}}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2}. Since \\\\varphi_{v,0} = \\\\varphi_{p,0}, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by :z(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s) = z(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s)= \\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\hat{p}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s)}{\\\\hat{v}(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s)}\\\\right= \\\\frac{p}{v} = \\\\frac{\\\\rho c^2 k_x}{\\\\omega}. Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to those of the particle velocity and the sound pressure by :\\\\delta = \\\\frac{v}{\\\\omega}, :\\\\delta = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\omega z(\\\\mathbf{r},\\\\, s)}.

The assets and property of the company are redistributed. Liquidation is also sometimes referred to as winding-up or dissolution, although dissolution technically refers to the last stage of liquidation. The process of liquidation also arises when customs, an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting and safeguarding customs duties, determines the final computation or ascertainment of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.19 CFR ¬ß159.1 Liquidation may either be compulsory (sometimes referred to as a creditors' liquidation or receivership following bankruptcy, which may result in the court creating a \\"liquidation trust\\") or voluntary (sometimes referred to as a shareholders' liquidation, although some voluntary liquidations are controlled by the creditors). The term \\"liquidation\\" is also sometimes used informally to describe a company seeking to divest of some of its assets. For instance, a retail chain may wish to close some of its stores. For efficiency's sake, it will often sell these at a discount to a company specializing in real estate liquidation instead of becoming involved in an area it may lack sufficient expertise in to operate with maximum profitability. Compulsory liquidation The parties which are entitled by law to petition for the compulsory liquidation of a company vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally, a petition may be lodged with the court for the compulsory liquidation of a company by: * The company itself * Any creditor which establishes a prima facie case * Contributories: Those shareholders be required to contribute to the company's assets on liquidation * A minister, usually the one responsible for competition and business * An official receiver Grounds The grounds upon which an entity can apply to the court for an order of compulsory liquidation also vary between jurisdictions, but normally include: * The company has so resolved * The company was incorporated as a corporation, and has not been issued with a trading certificate (or equivalent) within 12 months of registration * It is an \\"old public company\\" (i.e. one that has not re-registered as a public company or become a private company under more recent companies legislation requiring this) * It has not commenced business within the statutorily prescribed time (normally one year) of its incorporation, or has not carried on business for a statutorily prescribed amount of time * The number of members has fallen below the minimum prescribed by statute * The company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due * It is just and equitable to wind up the company, as for example specified by an Insolvency Act In practice, the vast majority of compulsory winding-up applications are made under one of the last two grounds. An order will not generally be made if the purpose of the application is to enforce payment of a debt which is bona fide disputed.See Stonegate Securities Ltd v Gregory [1980] Ch 576, per Buckley L.J. at 579 A \\"just and equitable\\" winding- up enables the grounds to subject the strict legal rights of the shareholders to equitable considerations. It can take account of personal relationships of mutual trust and confidence in small parties, particularly, for example, where there is a breach of an understanding that all of the members may participate in the business,Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries [1972] 2 AER 492 or of an implied obligation to participate in management.Tay Bok Choon v Tahansan Sdn Bhd [1987] BCLC 472 An order might be made where the majority shareholders deprive the minority of their right to appoint and remove their own director.Re A & BC Chewing Gum Ltd [1975] 1 WLR 579 The order Once liquidation commences (which depends upon applicable law, but will generally be when the petition was originally presented, and not when the court makes the order), dispositions of the company's generally void, and litigation involving the company is generally restrained. Upon hearing the application, the court may either dismiss the petition or make the order for winding-up. The court may dismiss the application if the petitioner unreasonably refrains from an alternative course of action.Re A Company (No 001573 of 1983) [1983] Com LR 202 The court may appoint an official receiver, and one or more liquidators, and has general powers to enable rights and liabilities of claimants and contributories to be settled. Separate meetings of creditors and contributories may decide to nominate a person for the appointment of a liquidator and possibly of a supervisory liquidation committee. Administrative Receiver The person appointed by the holder of a floating charge debenture over a company‚Äôs assets to collect in and realise the assets of that company and to repay the indebtedness to the debenture holder. Voluntary liquidation Voluntary liquidation occurs when the members of a company resolve to voluntarily wind up its affairs and dissolve. Voluntary liquidation begins when the company passes the resolution, and the company will generally cease to carry on business at that time (if it has not done so already). A creditors‚Äô voluntary liquidation (CVL) is a process designed to allow an insolvent company to close voluntarily. The decision to liquidate is made by a board resolution, but instigated by the director(s). 75 percent of the company's shareholders must agree to liquidate for liquidation proceedings to advance. If a limited company‚Äôs liabilities outweigh its assets, or the company cannot pay its bills when they fall due, the company becomes insolvent. If the company is solvent, and the members have made a statutory declaration of solvency, the liquidation will proceed as a members' voluntary winding-up. In that case, the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding-up, and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company's affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors' voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed. Where a voluntary winding-up of a company has begun, a compulsory liquidation order is still possible, but the petitioning contributory would need to satisfy the court that a voluntary liquidation would prejudice the contributors. Misconduct The liquidator will normally have a duty to ascertain whether any misconduct has been conducted by those in control of the company which has caused prejudice to the general body of creditors. In some legal systems, in appropriate cases, the liquidator may be able to bring an action against errant directors or shadow directors for either wrongful trading or fraudulent trading. The liquidator may also have to determine whether any payments made by the company or transactions entered into may be voidable as a transaction at an undervalue or an unfair preference. Priority of claims The main purpose of a liquidation where the company is insolvent is to collect its assets, determine the outstanding claims against the company, and satisfy those claims in the manner and order prescribed by law. The liquidator must determine the company's title to property in its possession. Property which is in the possession of the company, but which was supplied under a valid retention of title clause will generally have to be returned to the supplier. Property which is held by the company on trust for third parties will not form part of the company's assets available to pay creditors.See for example, Barclays Bank v Quistclose [1970] AC 56 Before the claims are met, secured creditors are entitled to enforce their claims against the assets of the company to the extent that they are subject to a valid security interest. In most legal systems, only fixed security takes precedence over all claims; security by way of floating charge may be postponed to the preferential creditors. Claimants with non-monetary claims against the company may be able to enforce their rights against the company. For example, a party who had a valid contract for the purchase of land against the company may be able to obtain an order for specific performance, and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.Re Coregrange Ltd [1984] BCLC 453 After the removal of all assets which are subject to retention of title arrangements, fixed security, or are otherwise subject to proprietary claims of others, the liquidator will pay the claims against the company's assets. Generally, the priority of claims on the company's assets will be determined in the following order: # Liquidators costs # Creditors with fixed charge over assets # Costs incurred by an administrator # Amounts owing to employees for wages/superannuation # Payments owing in respect of worker's injuries # Amounts owing to employees for leave # Retrenchment payments owing to employees # Creditors with floating charge over assets # Creditors without security over assets # Shareholders (Liquidating distribution) Unclaimed assets will usually vest in the state as bona vacantia. Dissolution Having wound-up the company's affairs, the liquidator must call a final meeting of the members (if it is a members' voluntary winding-up), creditors (if it is a compulsory winding-up) or both (if it is a creditors' voluntary winding-up). The liquidator is then usually required to send final accounts to the Registrar and to notify the court. The company is then dissolved. However, in common jurisdictions, the court has a discretion for a period of time after dissolution to declare the dissolution void to enable the completion of any unfinished business. Striking off the register In some jurisdictions, the company may elect to simply be struck off the companies register as a cheaper alternative to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the registrar of companies, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off. However, in such cases the company may be restored to the register if it is just and equitable so to do (for example, if the rights of any creditors or members have been prejudiced).Re Priceland Limited [1997] 1 BCLC 467 In the event the company does not file an annual return or annual accounts, and the company's file remains inactive, in due course, the registrar will strike the company off the register. Provisional liquidation Under the corporate insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions, where a company has been engaged in misconduct or where the assets of the company are thought to be in jeopardy, it is sometimes possible to put a company into provisional liquidation, whereby a liquidator is appointed on an interim basis to safeguard the position of the company pending the hearing of the full winding- up petition. The duty of the provisional liquidator is to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the status quo pending the hearing of the petition; the provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to creditors. Phoenix companies In the UK, many companies in debt decide it is more beneficial to start again by creating a new company, often referred to as a phoenix company. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances it may appear ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the company in liquidation without approval from the Court, they will be committing an offence under ¬ß216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions). Persons participating in the management of the 'phoenix' company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under ¬ß217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.

Biography Carmen is one of two main protagonists (the other being her brother Juni) in the films. For most of her life, Carmen had no idea her parents were secretly spies. Carmen's main concern was with her little brother Juni, whom she felt she was unfairly forced to babysit. She responded by treating Juni abusively. However, Carmen was also hiding her own secrets: in addition to skipping school to go on outings to the city without her parents‚Äô permission, she also had to deal with wearing diapers because of a bedwetting problem that she was desperate to hide from her brother.  Appearances  Spy Kids In the first Spy Kids film, Carmen and Juni discover the truth about their parents when they are kidnapped. Though Carmen and Juni fight with each other throughout their adventure, the two of them bond and form a rapport of mutual respect. Carmen is also influenced by her real uncle Machete, who let her know that he had the same problem with his younger brother, Carmen's father. She also finds out that her brother had always been aware of her nighttime bedwetting and had kept that knowledge to himself on her mother's instructions. Carmen also develops a sense of family, and insists that if any Cortezes become involved in missions, then all of them should. Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams By Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, Carmen has stopped calling her brother names, and they are able to work better as a team. However, problems still arise between them from a romantic interest Carmen develops in Gary Giggles. Gary however, has mixed emotions for Carmen. At some events, it is evident that he likes her, and at some events, it looks as if he doesn't, like when he says to Juni that Carmen is a dork. Juni tries to convince Carmen that Gary is trouble, but to no avail. Later, Carmen, after a conversation with Gary's little sister Gerti, changes her mind about Gary and convinces Gerti to turn against her father, who has an evil plan for world domination. Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over In Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, Carmen, an experienced hacker, goes on a quest to shut down the Toymaker's evil video game Game Over, which enslaves its users. However, she makes it only as far as Level 4, before being kidnapped and held prisoner by the Toymaker. Juni comes to her rescue and they continue on her quest to shut down the game. Carmen is absent for most of the movie, and she only appears near the film's climax. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World Alexa Vega reprised the role in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World as a supporting character. Carmen and Juni provide guidance to the new agents, Rebecca and Cecil. During the gap between the 3rd and 4th film, Juni left the O.S.S., leaving Carmen feeling abandoned and betrayed. When he does return during the film, the two are extremely hostile toward each other (much like they were in the first film), before eventually reconciling and becoming a team again. Carmen and Juni reopen the Spy Kids program as its new co-directors. The enemy is \\"The Timekeeper\\", who wants Rebecca's necklace so he can travel back in time to spend more time with his father. Rebecca and Cecil stop him and encourage him to be good. Spy Kids: Mission Critical Ashley Bornancin replaced Vega in the role of Carmen in the reboot series Spy Kids: Mission Critical in a main capacity. The series follows Carmen and Juni as they train and lead a team of fellow Spy Kids cadets against the forces of S.W.A.M.P. (Sinister Wrongdoers Against Mankind's Preservation) and their diabolical leader, Golden Brain.

He wrote or edited over 30 books on New Zealand topics, including the best-selling Penguin History of New Zealand, which was the most popular New Zealand book of 2004. Life King was born in Wellington to Eleanor and Commander Lewis King, one of four children. Educated at Sacred Heart College in Auckland and St. Patrick's College, Silverstream, he went on to study history at Victoria University of Wellington before working as a journalist at the Waikato Times newspaper in Hamilton in 1968. King earned degrees in history at Victoria, (BA 1967) and the University of Waikato (MA 1968), and gained his PhD at Waikato (1978). In 1997 he received an honorary DLitt at Victoria. He was Visiting Professor of New Zealand Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and taught or held fellowships at six other universities. Although not MƒÅori himself, King was well known for his knowledge of MƒÅori culture and history. New Zealand Listener, one of New Zealand's most popular weekly magazines, dubbed King \\"the people's historian\\"Watkin, Tim. \\"The People's Historian\\" New Zealand Listener Vol 193 No 3335, 10‚Äì16 April 2004. for his efforts to write about and for the local populace. As a biographer, King published works on Te Puea Herangi, Whina Cooper, Frank Sargeson (1995) and Janet Frame (2000). As an historian, King's works include Being PƒÅkehƒÅ (1985), Moriori (1989), and The Penguin History of New Zealand (July 2003), the latter of which was, by February 2004, into its seventh edition. In all, King wrote, co-wrote and edited more than 30 books on a diverse range of New Zealand topics. He contributed to all five volumes of the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. King was always sensitive to the fact that he was a PƒÅkehƒÅ writing about the MƒÅori world and always sought to establish close personal relationships with those he wrote about and their whƒÅnau, hap≈´ and iwi authorities. He believed that all PƒÅkehƒÅ had the same right to be called indigenous as MƒÅori and disagreed with claims that only MƒÅori have a spiritual association with mountains, lakes and rivers. He noted a recent tendency in literature to romanticise MƒÅori life and indicated that certain aspects of MƒÅori society in the pre-European era were harsher and less humane than the results of British colonisation. King's two children with his first wife Ros are the filmmaker Jonathan King and novelist Rachael King. The marriage ended amicably in 1974, while they were sharing a communal house with two other families. King was a diabetic and had post-polio syndrome. He received six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for throat cancer discovered in October 2003, which was in remission by 2004. Following King's death, an essay on John Money was posthumously published in an exhibition catalogue for the Eastern Southland Gallery in Gore; King had planned to write a full biography on Money, but had lacked funding to do so in his lifetime. Death King and his second wife, Maria Jungowska, were killed when their car crashed into a tree and caught fire near Maramarua, on State Highway 2 in the north Waikato. The cause of the crash was a mystery at the time, but a coroner's inquest determined it was most likely caused by driver inattention. Honours and awards In 1980, King won the Feltex television writers' award, and was awarded a Winston Churchill Fellowship. In the 1988 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature. Also in 1988, he received a Fulbright Visiting Writers' Fellowship. He won several prizes at the New Zealand Book Awards: the award for non-fiction in 1978; the Wattie Book of the Year Award in 1984 and 1990; and in 2004 his book, The Penguin History of New Zealand, was overwhelmingly voted the readers' choice award winner. He received New Zealand Literary Fund awards in 1987 and 1989, and was the Burns Fellow at the University of Otago in 1998‚Äì1999. King was winner of the 2003 Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement in non-fiction, and the same year The New Zealand Herald named him New Zealander of the Year.

The architecture of Montreal is characterized by a wide variety of architectural styles. The architecture of Montreal, Quebec, Canada is characterized by the juxtaposition of the old and the new and a wide variety of architectural styles, the legacy of two successive colonizations by the French, the British, and the close presence of modern architecture to the south. Much like Quebec City, the city of Montreal had fortifications, but they were destroyed between 1804 and 1817. For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada. The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest, especially in the Downtown area and in Old Montreal. Many historical buildings in Old Montreal retain their original form, notably the impressive 19th century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on Saint Jacques Street (formerly known as Saint James Street). From the Art Deco period, Montreal offers a handful of notable examples: Ernest Cormier's Universit√© de Montr√©al main building located on the northern side of Mount Royal and the Aldred Building at Place d'Armes, an historic square in Old Montreal. In fact, Place d'Armes, shown in panorama below, is surrounded by buildings representing several major periods in Montreal architecture: the Gothic Revival Notre-Dame Basilica; New York Life Building, Montreal's first high-rise; the Pantheon-like Bank of Montreal head office, Canada's first bank; the aforementioned Aldred Building. (1931) and the International style 500 Place D'Armes. Church architecture Dedicated in 1829, Notre-Dame Basilica is one of four Roman Catholic basilicas located in the city. Founded as a Roman Catholic French colony and nicknamed \\"la ville aux cent clochers\\" (the city of a hundred belltowers), Montreal is renowned for its churches. The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Other well-known churches include Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church. Following the British victory in the Seven Years' War, many protestant immigrants came to the city from England, Scotland and Ireland. This led to various Protestant churches being built to accommodate the growing community. The two most notable of these are the Saint James United Church and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was suspended above an excavated pit during the construction of the Promenades Cath√©drale mall, part of Montreal's Underground City. Skyscrapers At , 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re is postmodern skyscraper, and the tallest building in the city. Skyscraper construction in Montreal has swung between periods of intense activity and prolonged lulls. A two-year period from 1962 to 1964 saw the completion of four of Montreal's ten tallest buildings: Tour de la Bourse, I. M. Pei's landmark cruciform Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Building and CIL House. Its tallest buildings, the 51-storey 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re and the 47-storey 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque, were both completed in 1992. Montreal places height-limits on skyscrapers so that they do not exceed the height of Mount Royal. The city forbids any building from reaching an elevation higher than or 223 metres above mean sea level. Above-ground height is further limited in most areas and only a few downtown land plots are allowed to exceed 120 metres in height. The limit is currently attained by 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re and 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque, the latter of which is shorter, but built on higher ground. The only way to reach higher than 1000 de La Gaucheti√®re while respecting this limit would be to build on the lowest part of downtown near Tour de la Bourse; the maximum height there would be approximately 210 metres. The Tour de Montr√©al, incorporated into the north base of Montreal's Olympic Stadium is the tallest inclined tower in the world, at . Expo 67 Habitat 67 is a model community and housing complex that was showcased at Expo 67. Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, popularly known as Expo 67, featured a wide range of architectural designs. Though most pavilions were temporary structures, several remaining structures have become Montreal landmarks, including the geodesic dome US Pavilion, now the Montreal Biosph√®re, as well as Moshe Safdie's striking Habitat 67 apartment complex. The French pavilion and Qu√©bec Pavilion of Expo 67 underwent significant renovations in 1992 to become the Montreal Casino. Montreal Metro In terms of modern architecture, the Montreal Metro is filled with a profusion of public art by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture. In addition, the design and ornamentation of each station in the Metro system is unique, much like the Stockholm Metro and the Moscow Metro. Other notable structures The Olympic Stadium was the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics. It features the world's tallest inclined tower. Other significant works of modern architecture in Montreal include the Brutalist Place Bonaventure, the world's second largest commercial building when it was completed in 1967, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Westmount Square and Roger Taillibert's controversial Olympic Stadium, which incorporates the world's tallest inclined tower, at 175 metres. Montreal architects Pierre Boulva and Jacques David completed a number of modernist landmarks in the 1960s, including the Palais de justice de Montr√©al, 500 Place D'Armes, Th√©√¢tre Maisonneuve, the Dow Planetarium and the Place-des- Arts, Atwater and Lucien-L'Allier metro stations. In 2006, the city was recognized by the international design community as a UNESCO City of Design, one of the three world design capitals. Heritage conservation The Conseil du patrimoine de Montr√©al advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation. A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: Save Montreal, co-founded by Michael Fish in 1974, and Heritage Montreal, founded by Phyllis Lambert two years later.Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003). \\"The museum that is Montreal\\", Montreal Mirror 19 (19). Retrieved on 2009-02-11. In 1979, Lambert founded the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA), an architecture museum and research centre located in downtown Montreal. In October 2009, Lambert, Heritage Montreal and others formed a think tank called the Institut de politiques alternatives de Montr√©al to advise the city on a range of matters including urban planning, development and heritage.

They fused Finnish melancholy with catchy rock melodies. The band was led by the frontman Pertti Neumann (also known as Pertti Nieminen). For a few years of top success, Dingo was one of the most popular Finnish rock bands and caused a phenomenon called \\"Dingomania\\" all over Finland. Dingo's hit number one was called \\"Autiotalo\\", released also in English as \\"The House without a Name\\". A separate youth culture was formed in Finland, known as the Dingoes. The success, however, lasted only for a couple of years and Dingo broke up in October 1986. The band regrouped in 1998 and continues to perform occasionally. During their career, the band sold over 500,000 records in Finland. Apart from \\"The House without a Name\\" Dingo has released the following songs in English: \\"Tell Me Now\\" (1986) and \\"Tobacco Road\\" (1986).  Biography   1980s  Dingo was formed in 1982. Through different phases it reached its permanent line-up and recorded a demo which was sent to different labels, for example Finnlevy and Poko Rekords. Poko Rekords abandoned the demo and there has been a rumour that the demo \\"accidentally\\" ended up in the wrong drawer. On the other hand, it took only one song to convince Finnlevy. That song was \\"H√∂lm√∂l√§isten laiva\\" and from the songs we know, \\"Sin√§ ja min√§\\" was also on the demo. Through different occurrences Dingo recorded their first album Nimeni on Dingo before they started playing live gigs. The album sold amazingly right from the beginning. Although at this point Dingo was still in the shadow of another popular band from Pori - Y√∂, since their debut album Varietee had sold over 60 000 copies and right after its release it became number 1 on different charts. Also \\"Nimeni on Dingo\\" became a number 1 -album and as time passed it was sold a lot more than Y√∂‚Äôs album. There were many hits on the album: Sin√§ ja min√§, Levoton Tuhkimo, Lakatut varpaankynnet and Pistoolisankari to name a few. Along the success came also the fans. In public Dingo became known as a band for teenage girls. The fans screamed and cried of happiness when seeing their idols live. Especially the blonde frontman, Neumann was idolized tremendously. In the \\"rock circles\\" that was strongly despised and naturally, envied. A lot more was yet to come. After Eve leaving the band (and Pepe replacing him) in the end of 1984, the new single \\"Autiotalo\\" was released. The single climbed to the first position on every chart and the band reached incredible fame. Dingo was no longer considered to be a band for teenage girls only, since also older people started to like them, including the teenagers‚Äô parents. While waiting for the new album to be released, the new Dingo-fans ran into stores to buy the first album and surprisingly \\"Nimeni on Dingo\\" reached the 3d position on sales list. By the time the new album was published in 1985 it had been ordered in advance the amount of a gold album (and at the time a diamond album, meaning over 50 000 copies. Kerj√§l√§isten valtakunta exceeded all expectations. The album remained as a number one for 3‚Äì4 months and in the end the sales were around 190 000 copies. Every song on the album became a hit, especially the single \\"Kirjoitan\\". It can be said that Dingo became an all time number one in all aspects: fame, hysteria, sales, media value and the impact on Finnish rock music at the time. They influenced several different Finnish bands and musicians such as Pyh√§t Nuket (the hit Enkelit sulkivat silm√§ns√§), SIG and Pave Maijanen. The year 1984 was the year of the \\"Dingo- fever\\". It was no longer a question of rock music alone, but a sociologically interesting phenomenon as well. Dingo was not only a rock band but also a corporation. The band members were seen on TV-programs and on covers of the magazines. On the tour the success was unbelievable. Neumann‚Äôs philosophical preferences, the conscious avoiding of publicity and several trips to Ireland started to alienate Dingo from their younger audience. Yet Neumann‚Äôs solo single \\"Menn√§√§n hiljaa markkinoille\\" and the expectancy of the new Dingo single kept the band in headlines. Finally in November 1985 \\"Kunnian kent√§t\\" was released. The music sounded so familiar and excellent that Neumann‚Äôs song- writing-pen was to be considered to be extremely sharp. The charts position was no surprise; number 1. The new album was supposed to be released on Christmas, but it was not released that soon. Instead Dingo had a huge tour around the country which turned out to be very expensive for the band since someone weaselled a part of their earnings. Th year 1986 was the year of international dance music. Finland also had its own popular dance music group in the form of Bogart Co. Also, the album Kahdeksas ihme by Eppu Normaali reminded that there is excellent Finnish rock music other than Dingo. After living in silence for quite some time Dingo published their new album Pyh√§ klaani but it didn‚Äôt turn out to be as successful as their earlier albums. \\"Koulukapina\\", \\"Kreivin sormus\\" and \\"Suru tahtoo sua\\" were the radio hits from the album. However \\"Pyh√§ klaani\\" also became a number 1, but the sales of 80 000 copies was a disappointment. The change of direction that Neumann‚Äôs musical style and especially lyrics had experienced didn‚Äôt please everyone. However, Dingo still had it going for them. They wanted to publish a single in English and also make a video. The English version of \\"Autiotalo\\" (The house without a name) and the b-side, English version of \\"Kirjoitan\\" (Tell me now) were not successful outside Finland as we know by now. The next single released in Finnish was \\"Juhannustanssit\\" and it was conveniently released around the midsummer time (=juhannus in Finnish) in 1986. The single was such wild rock song that the band‚Äôs style seemed to please the rock critics more than the general audience. Dingo was still a very popular band and when the fans gathered in Nivala, Tuiskula in the autumn of 1986, they were shocked by the news of their favourite band falling apart. Replacing Pete on the keyboards in Nivala there was Tumppi, who only had time to perform in the band for a few weeks. From the vicinity of the Dingo-members a band called S.E.X was formed. The journey of S.E.X remained shorter than expected, since they only had time to create two or three singles depending on whether the song \\"Vieriv√§ kivi\\" sung by Pepe was counted as one. The other two were \\"Uuden aamun kitarat\\" and \\"Canada\\". Also the eponymous album S.E.X was released in a rather posthumous spirit.  1990s  There were rumours of Dingo getting back together during the years 1990-91, but only after publishing the compilation album Tuhkimotarina. In 1993 the band united to record a new song which was added to the next compilation album Sin√§ ja min√§. The new song was named \\"Perjantai\\". Finally, in the spring of 1994 a whole new studio album, Via Finlandia, was released. The most popular songs on the album were \\"El√§m√§ni sankari\\" and \\"N√§hd√§√§n taas\\". Dingo also went on tour with Pave Maijanen on the keyboards. It took many by surprise that Dingo quit working together again. After all, Via Finlandia had also sold tens of thousands of copies.  2000s  Dingo is publishing expected new material after 11 years. In June 2005 a new single \\"Musta leski\\" was released and a whole album in the end of the same year. Dingo is still active. Neumann and another original member of the band, Eve, constitute the core of the band. The new line-up tours intensely around Finland. The gigs have a combination of both Dingo's old and new music.

Appearances Spy Kids Juni, like his older sister Carmen, had no idea his parents were secret agents until the first Spy Kids film. He is very insecure with himself, and lives in the world of the television show, Floop's Fooglies. When Juni learns that Floop is really a criminal mastermind that had kidnapped his parents, he takes it surprisingly well, adjusting to the fact very quickly. Juni wins some respect from his sister on their quest. It was shown within the first two movies that Juni is able to mimic another person's voice perfectly, a trait his father claims he derives from his mother. Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams In Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, Juni develops a crush on the president's daughter Alexandra. There is particularly friction between Juni and Gary Giggles due to Carmen's romantic interest in Gary. After a fight resulting in Magna Men stealing a prototype of the Transmooker (It being caused when Gary tried to take it from Juni for the glory, only to blame Juni when the Magna Men took it away), Juni gets fired from the OSS. However, Carmen hacked him back in the organization so they could recover the Transmooker. After they successfully save the Transmooker from Donagon Giggles, Gary's father, Juni quit the OSS. Juni's robotic pet spider, R.A.L.P.H., is first shown in this movie near the beginning sections, but is later squashed by Gary Giggles, after he is sent to spy over him and his sister during the briefing of the Ukata Assignment, but shown fixed during the credits. Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over In Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over Juni is pulled out of retirement to rescue his sister from her failed mission to shut down the video game Game Over. Juni finds her, but it is no accident. Juni and the others are secretly being manipulated, because the Toymaker has an interest in Juni's grandfather. Despite this, or rather because of this, Juni and the others manage to save the day. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World Daryl Sabara reprised his role as Juni in Spy Kids: All the Time in the World which was released August 19, 2011. Like Alexa Vega's character, Juni is now a supporting character, with less screentime as to focus on the newer agents. During the long gap between the 3rd and 4th film, Carmen and Juni have not gotten along very well, mostly picking on each other like they did in the 1st film. After trying to work on his own as a spy, he reveals to Carmen he didn't think it would be cool to work with his sister. However, in the end they reconcile and become co-leaders of the new Spy Kids program. Spy Kids: Mission Critical Carter Hastings replaced Sabara in the role of Juni in the reboot series Spy Kids: Mission Critical in a main capacity. The series follows Juni and Carmen as they train and lead a team of fellow Spy Kids cadets against the forces of S.W.A.M.P. (Sinister Wrongdoers Against Mankind's Preservation) and their diabolical leader, Golden Brain.

She has been the MLA for the Victoria-Beacon Hill electoral district since 2005. She is the former Leader of the Opposition in British Columbia and former leader of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP), a social democratic political party. She announced her intention to resign as leader on December 6, 2010 and was officially replaced by interim leader Dawn Black on January 20, 2011.DAWN BLACK RATIFIED AS BC NDP INTERIM LEADER Carole James Members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia James currently serves as the 14th Deputy Premier of British Columbia and Minister of Finance under John Horgan. Background James was born in Dukinfield, Cheshire, England, and raised in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, and in Victoria, British Columbia. After graduating from high school, James and her first husband worked in institutions for the developmentally disabled in Alberta and British Columbia. As a mother of young children, Alison and Evan, she became involved in a parents' group in Victoria, which led to her first foray into politics. James self-identifies as part M√©tis, and in 2004 married her long-time partner, Albert Gerow, a First Nations artist and former Burns Lake municipal councillor and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. Gerow was the chief of the Ts'il Kaz Koh First Nation in Burns Lake. James has been a foster parent for over twenty years. On July 13, 2006, James announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with localized uterine endometrial cancer. She underwent surgery and radiation treatment and her prognosis is considered to be excellent. In March 2020, James announced that she was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and will not run in the next provincial election. Early career James served on the Greater Victoria School Board from 1990 to 2001, including seven terms as chair, and gained a province-wide profile in her unprecedented five terms as president of the BC School Trustees Association. She also served at the national level as vice-president of the Canadian School Boards Association. From 1999 to 2001, James held the position of director of child care policy for the British Columbia government. In addition, she served on several local and provincial panels and committees. In 2001, James ran unsuccessfully for the NDP in the riding of Victoria-Beacon Hill only losing by 35 Votes to BC Liberal candidate Jeff Bray. She subsequently moved to Prince George, British Columbia to serve as the director of child and family services for Carrier Sekani Family Services, and later as co-ordinator of the Northern Aboriginal Authority for Families. Political career  BCNDP leadership  James was elected leader of the provincial NDP on November 23, 2003. At the time of her election the party was suffering low morale in the wake of the 2001 provincial election, which had reduced the NDP to only two seats in the Legislative Assembly. During her campaign to win the party leadership, James pledged to modernize the NDP's ideology and internal structures and build a broader base of support for the party, a move which alienated some traditional supporters. During the 2005 provincial election, James campaigned heavily on her name and image. On election night James and the NDP surprised many supporters and critics alike with a very strong electoral showing; the party winning 41.52 per cent of the popular vote (a 19.96 per cent increase from the 2001 election result) and 33 out of 79 seats in the Legislative Assembly. James won her seat in the riding of Victoria-Beacon Hill with 57.01 per cent of the vote, defeating the incumbent BC Liberal MLA Jeff Bray by an almost 2-1 margin. She was re-elected in 2009, 2013, and 2017. Leadership controversy and resignation On December 1, 2010, Jenny Kwan, a prominent party member, released a statement to the media criticizing James' leadership of the New Democratic Party, and calling for an immediate leadership convention. In response to Kwan's statement, James called an emergency caucus session to address opposition to her continued leadership. While the session was meant to take place on December 5, it was later postponed so that private discussions could take place with a group of thirteen caucus members opposed to James' continued leadership. On short notice on December 6, James announced she would resign the party's leadership. She continued in the position, however, until Dawn Black was chosen to act as Interim Leader. James served as opposition Critic for Children and Family Development under her successor, Adrian Dix. She was promoted to the Finance portfolio under John Horgan, and was also named deputy leader of the BC NDP and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  In government  When the BC NDP won a minority government in 2017, James became Deputy Premier and Finance Minister.

Rules One player is chosen as \\"It\\". The \\"It\\" player, with closed eyes, tries to find and tag any one of the other players, relying on hearing to find someone to tag. The player who is \\"It\\" shouts \\"Marco\\" and the other players must all respond by shouting \\"Polo\\", which the \\"It\\" player uses to try to find them. If a player is tagged, then that player becomes \\"It\\". If \\"It\\" suspects that a player has left the pool, they can shout \\"Fish out of water!\\" and the player who is out of the pool becomes the new \\"It\\". The game can also be played on land, with slightly modified rules. It is similar to blind man's buff, where one person is blindfolded while others choose hiding places around the room. While playing one cannot hold another player in place to be tagged or that person is it. History The game shares its name with the 13th-century Italian trader and explorer Marco Polo. There does not appear to be any real connection between the game and the explorer of the same name, although according to one whimsical explanation, \\"legend has it that the famed explorer didn't really have a clue as to where he was going\\", this being reflected in the \\"It\\" player's behavior. Although water polo is another popular pool game, the name of \\"Marco Polo\\" is apparently unrelated. The game has similar traits with blind man's bluff, an essentially identical game played on dry land which dates back to at least the 16th century. Marco Polo was known as a water game in America by the 1960s. Between 1965 and 1970, some respondents to a Dictionary of American Regional English survey, when asked to name a game played in the water, responded with \\"Marco Polo.\\"\\"Games Played in the Water\\". Dictionary of American Regional English Survey. In modern times, Marco Polo is played worldwide. Various regions have their own versions of the game, with names such as Mermaid on the Rocks and Alligator. The term \\"Marco Polo game\\" is sometimes used to describe an online game where a similar call-and-response system of gameplay is adopted. Analysis Marco Polo is an \\"easily modifiable game\\", and is based on the notion of call-and-response. Marco Polo is a location-based game because players are confined to a set space and because players must locate each other using auditory clues. Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society argues \\"there is bipolarity in the reversal of roles...there are repeated actions, a routine to be repeated, rules to be observed, and verbal signs to be used\\". Playing this game can allow children to experiment with different social roles, for example learning what it means to be an outcast in the role of \\"It\\" (isolated, confined to a space, and unable to see others). According to the Nevada Regional Medical Center, \\"Marco Polo is not only fun, it can be a good workout. It also puts less stress on your bones and joints because the water makes your body float.\\" References Category:Hide-and-seek variants Category:Swimming pool games Category:Tag variants Category:Cultural depictions of Marco Polo ","title":"Marco Polo (game)"},{"id":"565137","text":"The Bow River is a river in Alberta, Canada. It begins within the Canadian Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies, where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river's banks, is considered a part of Calgary's self- image. First Nations made varied use of the river for sustenance before settlers of European origin arrived, such as using its valleys in the buffalo hunt. The name Bow refers to the reeds that grew along its banks and were used by the First Nations to make bows; the Blackfoot language name for the river is , meaning \\"river where bow reeds grow\\". The river is an important source of water for irrigation and drinking water. Between the years 1910 and 1960, the Bow River and its tributaries were engineered to provide hydroelectric power, primarily for Calgary's use. This significantly altered the river's flow and certain ecosystems. Course The Saskatchewan River drainage basin showing the Bow River Morant's Curve, Banff National Park The river's source is from the Bow Glacier, which is part of the Wapta Icefield. The outflow from this source flows into Bow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. It flows south to the village of Lake Louise then turns east and flows through the town of Banff and through Canmore. The Ghost Lake reservoir is formed upstream from the town of Cochrane. The Bow flows eastward to the city of Calgary; it continues on to form the South Saskatchewan River when the Bow joins with the Oldman River near Grassy Lake in southern Alberta. It reaches the Hudson Bay through the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and Nelson River. Communities along the Bow include Lake Louise, Banff, Canmore, Cochrane, Calgary, and Arrowwood. The Bow Falls are on the river's course, near Banff. The Bow River has a total length of and a drainage area of .Atlas of Canada - Rivers in Canada History First Nations The fur trader James Gaddy and the Hudson's Bay Company explorer David Thompson are traditionally considered to be the first people of European origin to see the Bow River. They camped along the Bow with a group of Piikani during the 1787‚Äì88 winter. Before they arrived, First Nations populations had lived in the Bow region for thousands of years. Among them were the Nakoda, Tsuu T ºina, and the Blackfoot Confederacy, consisting of the Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika peoples. The Kutenai had migrated westward, possibly in the early eighteenth century, but still occasionally ventured into the Bow region to hunt bison. First Nations used the river's valleys for the buffalo hunt, in which herds of buffalo were driven over cliffs or into valleys where they could be killed more easily with bows and arrows. Of all the First Nations groups that lived in the Bow River area, only the Nakoda fished the river regularly. While other groups likely caught fish during harder times, they primarily hunted buffalo during the summer season when fishing would have been most plentiful. The river's water naturally attracted game, which the First Nations men also hunted, while women gathered the roots, nuts and berries and processed them for food. The river's game, its local sources for firewood, and its valleys' shelter made the river a common camp location for First Nations during the prairie winters. The danger of crossing the river meant it was a natural boundary for First Nations. The two main fords of the lower Bow River, Blackfoot Crossing and a ford near the Bow's confluence with the Elbow River (where today's central Calgary developed), became important gathering points for First Nations to exchange goods and celebrate festivities. Blackfoot Crossing was used by the Siksika as a winter campsite and is today a part of their reserve. Fur traders began to move to the Bow River region following Thompson's expedition, but the river was not used extensively in the fur trade. First Nations already weakened by declining buffalo numbers and disease were further devastated by the introduction of the whisky trade. Fort Whoop-Up was established in 1869, and whisky traders were active along the Bow River during the 1870s. To stop these operations, the recently formed North-West Mounted Police (later the RCMP) established Fort Calgary in 1875 at the confluence of the Elbow River and the Bow. In order to proceed with railway construction through present-day Alberta and an orderly settlement of the Bow region, the government sought to extinguish title of First Nations to specific lands, and negotiated to do so through treaties. With bison numbers declining and white settlers becoming increasingly common in the region, the Nakoda, Tsuu T ºina, Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika met with representatives of the Canadian government at Blackfoot Crossing on the Bow River and signed Treaty 7 on 22 September 1877, ceding lands in exchange for defined reserves. From the perspective of the Canadian government, these groups had surrendered all their land privileges outside their reserves. The reserves of the Nakoda, Tsuu T ºina, and Siksika were established along the Bow River. Hydroelectric development, 1910‚Äì1960 Calgary was growing rapidly after 1900. The city businessmen pressed for dam construction in order to generate cheaper power from hydroelectric sources. William Maxwell Aitken, later with R. B. Bennett, formed Calgary Power Company in 1910. That year, on property purchased from the Nakoda, Calgary Power began constructing Alberta's first major hydroelectric plant, Horseshoe Dam. Calgary Power had problems before this dam was completed in 1911. The Bow River originates from a northern mountain, and its flow varies considerably depending upon the amount and location of winter snowfalls. A comprehensive study of the Bow's flow measurements had not been conducted. In its operations, Calgary Power relied upon estimates of the river's minimum flow during winter conditions. Thus, despite the amount of energy the company had contracted, it could not reliably fulfill these obligations during winters. With capital already invested in Horseshoe, Calgary Power opened another hydroelectric plant and reservoir two years later on the Bow's tributary, Kananaskis River. A reservoir was also created within Banff National Park in 1912 at Lake Minnewanka. Despite this additional reservoir and both plants, Calgary Power still struggled to fulfill its power contracts during winter months. In the 1920s, the company began planning new projects to control the Bow River. Lake Minnewanka The Bow River's hydroelectric development both conforms to and contrasts with elements of conservationist ideology in the United States during this era. This ideology espoused that rational and planned resource development guided by technicians should benefit the greatest number of people possible. In this light, rivers could be seen as a series of interdependent parts, and engineering all of them could give technicians control over the system as a whole for the benefit of society. Bow River trestle bridge Admitting their failure to plan effectively, Calgary Power stated in the In this process, Calgary Power ultimately fulfilled conservationist ideology as it increasingly brought the Bow River's interdependent sectors, and thus it as a whole, under control, while failing to embody conservationist ideals of rationally developing the Bow initially. Also in line with conservationism, bureaucrats allowing the construction of the Minnewanka reservoir espoused that the nation's development as a whole superseded the need to protect a small part of Banff National Park's nature. Calgary Power's ad hoc hydroelectric development of the Bow continued. Ghost Dam was built in 1929; a major development on the Bow's tributary, Spray River, was completed in 1951; and, at the behest of the provincial government, Bearspaw Dam was built in 1954 just west of Calgary to control flooding (the dam included a generating station). World War II's industrial demand increased pressure on the river: another hydroelectric development was built within Banff National Park, this time on the Cascade River, a tributary of the Bow. Between 1910 and 1960, the Bow River was radically changed as it was systematically engineered to control its water flow and provide hydroelectric power. The seasonal summer flooding in Calgary was an issue of the past. Water was held by reservoirs during spring and summer, permitting steady power generation during fall and winter. Comparing 1924‚Äì33 to 1954‚Äì63, the Bow River's January flow had approximately doubled 30 years later. Parts of the river, such as that preceding Ghost Dam, had practically turned into lakes. These developments had ecological effects, too. For example, reservoirs allowed certain fish species, such as the brown trout, to outcompete others, while other species virtually disappeared. Environmentalism Bowness, Calgary. By the 1950s, the Bow River's south bank in Calgary was a generally derelict commercial zone. The Calgary Local Council of Women was the most vocal advocate for turning this area into a park system as a part of a broader campaign for improved public and social services. Calgary City Council agreed to the idea in 1955, but by 1959 little progress had been made to fund the project. To accommodate increasing traffic flow through the growing city, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the city began negotiating a CPR reroute that would follow the south bank of the Bow River, turning it into a parkway and the CPR's rail mainline. Among the plan's critics was the Local Council of Women, reminding the city of its 1955 promise for a river park. After negotiations between the CPR and Calgary ended in failure in 1964, urban elites, such as golf clubs, increasingly endorsed the Local Council of Women's idea for a riverfront park system. Park advocates defined the Bow River within Calgary as the city's nature: it was something to be protected for and enjoyed by the public. However, as progress was made in the parks' creation, this \\"environmental\\" view of the Bow's nature proved selective. For example, trees were not to be cut down, but landscaping to accommodate cyclists was endorsed. In short, the river was valued above all when it suited human goals. Calgary eventually developed an extensive plan for the Bow River's park system, and it is considered an important element of Calgary's self-image today. The grassroots advocacy done by the Local Council of Women denotes emerging environmental sensibilities that are representative of larger trends occurring in North America during this period. Samuel Hays associated such movements with the emergence of an advanced consumer society. Unlike the pre-World War II elitist ideology of conservationist production, this emergent approach in North America was of grassroots consumers democratically engaging in environmental issues, and there was often tension between the public and managers of the environment. After an Alberta Environment official discovered a toxic \\"blob\\" in the Bow in October 1989, human needs again were given priority. Originating from an abandoned wood- preserving plant on the Bow River's bank, the \\"blob\\" in the river had released a carcinogenic plume that stretched more than downstream. Its discovery caused alarm in the media and amongst those living along the Bow River (two years earlier, 70 percent of Calgarians reported using the Bow recreationally). through Edworthy Park in Calgary As a result, Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, established the Bow River Water Quality Council as a provincial advisory body. The council was to promote awareness of the river's water quality and try to improve it through fact-finding and aiding inter-institutional coordination. It was composed of representatives from diverse interests such as First Nations, agriculture, and municipalities. Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river's environment. Their attitudes were not strictly human- centric, but, like those favoring a park system in Calgary, they defined the Bow River's environment as something worth preserving for human use. Greater changes in attitude toward the river were manifest in the Bow River Water Quality Council's reports over time. By 1994, the reports emphasized the importance of the Bow's ecological balance as a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park's ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks. 2013 floods In June 2013, southern Alberta had such heavy rainfall that catastrophic flooding occurred throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities declared local states of emergency on June 20 as water levels rose, and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders. Banff Designation as a national park In 1887 the Canadian parliament, under the urging of the Canadian Pacific Railway vice- president, William Van Horne, and the federal land agent, William Pearce, created Rocky Mountain Park, later to become known as Banff National Park. Originally , the park was Canada's first national park and included the Bow River. Eventually the park grew to include the Bow Glacier, an outflow of the Wapta Icefield and the source of the Bow River. The designation of Banff as a national park marked a turning point in the public's perception of the Bow River. The river began to be appreciated for its aesthetic value in addition to its industrial and agricultural uses. Officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the company who led the development of Banff, realized this element. When work began on a new luxury hotel in Banff in 1886‚Äì87, Van Horne personally redesigned and reoriented the plans so that the guests of the hotel would be able to see the vista of the Bow River. Many early postcards from Banff, as well as some current ones, prominently featured the Bow River. Sustainability as a national park Bow Valley and the town of Banff From the 1920s forward, the National Parks of Canada began to focus on the economic benefits of accessible, mass marketable tourism. Changes included new highways and the creation of storage reservoirs for the water needed to sustain the burgeoning community. The Bow River was now seen both for its aesthetic qualities and for new utilitarian aspects. By the 1950s Banff's raw sewage began to be discharged into the Bow River. Because of the self- purification powers of the cold, braided water, however, the Bow was incredibly effective as a natural sewage-treatment facility. Tourists and residents were often unaware of the transformation of the Bow River into a sewage system. As Banff continued to grow, the river continued to digest the increased volume of sewage. This practice, however, began to touch an ideological nerve among the tourists and residents of Banff. Pouring raw sewage into one of the main attractions of the park polluted both the river and, more importantly, the image of Banff. There was also fear that continued reliance on the Bow as a natural sewer would either cap the development of Banff or eventually have great risk to public health. By the 1960s, the town built a modern sewage facility and stopped releasing untreated waters into the Bow. The river's aesthetic qualities had increasing priority in terms of effects of development within the borders of a National Park. Irrigation and development The Bow River supplies the water for three irrigation districts in southern Alberta: the Eastern, Western, and Bow River irrigation districts. Eastern Irrigation District The Eastern Irrigation District (EID), headquartered in Brooks, Alberta, was originally part of land that the federal government granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in lieu of a portion of the payment for the construction of the railway. In 1929 the CPR split the property into two parts and divested itself of both sections. In 1935 a delegation of irrigation farmers took control of the eastern section and established the EID. The EID, diverting its water at the Bassano and Newell dams, is the largest private land owner in Alberta. Recently the EID began promoting the recreational possibilities that have developed alongside the district's irrigation development. The EID currently owns and operates the Rolling Hills Reservoir Campground. In 1951, the Province of Alberta also established Kinbrook Island Provincial Park on the eastern bank of the Newell reservoir, which has been stocked with native species of fish. Western Irrigation District The Western Irrigation District (WID), headquartered in Strathmore, Alberta, was the second half of the land divested by the CPR. The WID was established in 1944. The water of the WID, diverted at the Calgary Weir, is instrumental to southern Alberta agriculture and, unlike the other two districts, supports the urban needs city of Calgary. It is able to supply both agricultural and urban needs since the WID has higher levels of rainfall than the other two districts, and it receives much of Calgary's storm water. Bow River Irrigation District The Bow River Irrigation District (BRID), headquartered in Vauxhall, Alberta, was created in 1968, making it the most recent district to be supplied by the Bow. The BRID diverts the Bow at the Carseland weir and also uses the McGregor, Travers, and Little Bow dams. Each has a reservoir that is also used for recreational purposes. In March 2012, the citizens of the BRID voted in favour of expanding the area of the district by . An expansion of passed in 2004 as well. This means that, for the second time in eight years, the BRID will increase its demand on the Bow River by roughly 10 percent. Irrigation today Of the 45 crops that are grown in the Bow River basin, only 10 could be produced without irrigation. Because of the dependence of the region on Bow River irrigation water, in the early 21st century all three irrigation districts began to make major changes in order to continue to serve their large mandated areas. In 2006, as a part of the \\"Water for Life Initiative\\", the Alberta government placed a moratorium on any new licenses for water use from the Bow, Oldman, and South Saskatchewan River basins. The government also requested that the three irrigation districts increase their efficiency by 30 percent. The irrigation districts are improving their irrigation system by changing most canals to pipelines in order to decrease contamination, spillage, and loss of water to evaporation. A drawback of this change is that trees must be cleared in order to prevent roots from damaging the pipeline, changing the habitat. in 1987 the EID in association with the Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division and Ducks Unlimited Canada established a partnership to create additional wildlife habitat within the Eastern Irrigation District's boundaries. This demonstrated the EID's goal of encouraging wildlife in order to contribute to the growth of its tourist sector. Hunting and fishing are now promoted on the EID's website. Recreation The Bow River near Canmore The Bow River provides habitat for wildlife and many opportunities for recreation such as fishing and boating. Both fly fishermen and spinner fishermen share the river in all four seasons of the year. Serious anglers from all over the world visit the Bow River for its thriving population of brown trout and rainbow trout. The Bow River holds a resident population of rainbow and brown trout that has one of the best growth rates to be found on any river system in the world today. A trout that is 4 to 5 years old will be around long, and the Bow River holds many fish that are this size or larger. Mainly the river is fished south of the city of Calgary, past where the water treatment sites dump into the river. The volume of nutrients and number of fish are higher there. Outdoor adventurers use primarily three types of boats to enjoy the river, the inflatable boat, the Jon boat and the canoe. There are several spots located on the river to launch watercraft, including Graves Landing, Highway 22X Bridge, Policeman's Flats and McKinnon Flats. The Bow River pathway, is developed on both banks of the river throughout the city of Calgary and is used for cycling, hiking, jogging, as well as rollerblading and skateboarding. Recreation and industrial development The recreation and tourism sector of the Bow developed closely alongside the river's water irrigation projects. Ghost DamProjects such as the McGregor, Chestermere, and Ghost dams were originally built for either agricultural or electrical purposes but are also important for the recreational facilities they offer. Since their construction, the dams along the Bow River have played a central role in the development of the adjacent communities. Two key examples that demonstrate the connection of recreation and tourism with irrigation are the Chestermere and Basano dams. Following the construction of the Chestermere Dam in 1907, housing developments began to occur around the neighbouring lake and in 1992, because of these developments, Chestermere was declared a town. Similarity, after a three-year refurbishing project ending in 1987, the town of Bassano, about northeast of the dam, began advertising the Bassano dam as a tourist attraction for the town. At this point the Bassano dam now also started offering group tours, fishing and picnic areas, and a scenic viewpoint. Communities have also recently begun to appear around Ghost Dam as well. Calgary's weir project (Harvie Passage) In 1904 the Bow River Weir was constructed close to Calgary's downtown core in order to divert water into the Western Irrigation District. Since its construction a side effect of the weir had been that it created a circulating wave, with a lethal and powerful undertow, immediately downstream of it. Because rafting, canoeing, and kayaking down the Bow River are such popular summer activities, there had been many fatalities. Furthermore, because fish were not able to pass through the structure, they too became trapped in the circulating wave and a dense, unnatural concentration of pelicans congregated immediately following the weir. In order to combat the circulating wave and undertow, in August 2007 the Province of Alberta through the Alberta Lottery fund, in conjunction with the Calgary Foundation and the City of Calgary, began construction of the Bow River Weir paddle around, named the Harvie Passage. The passage allowed for the wave to be dispersed over a set of several smaller rapids while still supplying water to its irrigation district. Altogether, the paddle around cost 18 million dollars and was completed in the spring of 2012. In June 2013, just a year after the project was completed, Calgary was hit with an epic 100 year flood and all of the Harvie Passage work was destroyed. Since that flood, the passage has been closed to the public and a safety boom ahead of the rapids re-installed. Returning flood-ravaged Harvie Passage to its short-lived status as a world-class water playground will cost the province millions and keep it closed until at least 2018. It is estimated that rebuilding the Harvie Passage to the original intent of the project (completed in 2012) would cost an estimated $23.4 million.

He is regarded as one of the greatest strongmen of all time, and is credited with developing Iceland's national identity. He was named Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year in 1981, and was one of the best-known Icelandic athletes. In 2012, J√≥n P√°ll was inducted into the World's Strongest Man Hall of Fame. Early life J√≥n P√°ll was born in Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur on 28 April 1960, weighing and measuring . He was the first child of D√≥ra J√≥nsd√≥ttir and Sigmar J√≥nsson. He was raised by his mother and foster father Sveinn Gu√∞mundsson. The family moved to Stykkish√≥lmur when he was two. He remained there until the age of nine, when the family relocated to Reykjav√≠k. Growing up, he spent his summers on Sk√°leyjar and was active as a farmhand. He worked from dawn until dusk, carrying pails of water and assisting his foster father on seal hunts. He took up Glima, a traditional Icelandic form of wrestling, at the age of five and later played football and handball, as well as competing in swimming, middle-distance running,Jon Pall Sigmarsson, ICE ‚Äì Strongman and karate. Career J√≥n P√°ll was introduced to weight lifting in 1976, and began training at Jakab√≥l in 1978. In 1984 he won the Icelandic bodybuilding title in the +90 kg. class. His achievements in powerlifting also include Icelandic records in the bench press (with , , and ) and the squat (with , , and ), but his best performances were usually in the deadlift event, in which he set the European record many times (with , , , and ) and multiple world records in strongman competition deadlift variations, such as the rectangular handled wheel and one handed deadlift. J√≥n P√°ll was invited to the World's Strongest Man competition for the first time in 1983, in which he came in second only to Geoff Capes. The following year, at age 24, he defeated Capes and secured the title. During the final armwrestling event, in which J√≥n P√°ll was up against him, Capes appeared to be winning, pulling J√≥n P√°ll's arm down convincingly, but sustained a muscle tear in his forearm as J√≥n P√°ll started to thrust his arm back. Right after winning the bout, J√≥n P√°ll shouted \\"The King has lost his crown!\\" and won his first World's Strongest Man title in 1984. Although J√≥n P√°ll was closely defeated by Capes at the 1985 World's Strongest Man, he managed to regain the title in 1986. During the deadlift event at the 1985 World's Strongest Man competition, someone in the audience called him an Eskimo. J√≥n P√°ll shouted back: \\"I am not an Eskimo. I am a Viking!\\" and successfully lifted the cart. In 1986, J√≥n P√°ll first wrestled English author and Guinness World Record Holder Brian Sterling- Vete in a demonstration match for the TV news and print media held at Finnur Karlsson's gymnasium in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. Halfway through the match J√≥n and Sterling had plotted to surprise the audience with a supposed angry outburst leading to the two of them demonstrating their skills as martial artists. This showmanship became synonymous with both J√≥n P√°ll and Sterling. In 1987, J√≥n P√°ll clashed with his arguably greatest rival - 3 times World's Strongest Man winner Bill Kazmaier of Burlington, Wisconsin, USA, who had not been invited to compete at World's Strongest Man again after winning the competition 3 times in a row from 1980 to 1982. Kazmaier boasted some of the heaviest powerlifting lifts of that time including world records in the bench press with , deadlift with and total and had made his reputation in the 1980s as \\"the strongest man who ever lived\\" by breaking numerous strongman world records. At Pure Strength 1987, a competition held in place of the absent World's Strongest Man competition of that year on the grounds of Huntly Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, Geoff Capes, Bill Kazmaier and J√≥n P√°ll matched up to crown the strongest man on the planet. J√≥n P√°ll, being in the shape of his life, won the contest convincingly by winning 8 out of 10 events and even managed to beat Kazmaier, who was making his comeback into the strongman sport after having worked and travelled as a professional wrestler. A famous quote, \\"There is no reason to be alive if you can't do deadlift.\\" was shouted by J√≥n P√°ll when he won the deadlift event at this contest with a strongman world record lift of off a rectangular handled bar from knee height. At the 1988 World's Strongest Man the two rivals clashed again. As expected Kazmaier dominated the static events while J√≥n P√°ll, who had shed body-weight to cater for all the dynamic tests of strength of World's Strongest Man instead of the latter statically orientated events of Pure Strength 1987, was often victorious in the more athletic, speed- and endurance-oriented events. Although J√≥n P√°ll was beaten by Kazmaier in the deadlift, log lift and sack race, he managed to win the \\"weight over the bar event\\" and the McGlashen Stones in the end to secure the overall victory and to become the World's Strongest Man for the third time, equaling Kazmaier's record. After his victory J√≥n P√°ll said: \\"I may be the fastest strongman in the world, but I think Bill [Kazmaier] is the strongest on his feet.\\" After a disappointing third place at the 1989 World's Strongest Man, J√≥n P√°ll was able to win the competition, while injured, for a record breaking fourth time in 1990. O.D. Wilson, who was leading the competition with a comfortable 5¬Ω points before the last event (a 200 m race with a 100 kg weight on the back), weighed and lacked the endurance and running speed to complete the course quickly enough and ended up losing by half a point to the much lighter and faster J√≥n P√°ll. The 1990 World's Strongest Man proved to be J√≥n P√°ll's last appearance on the World's Strongest Man stage, as he was surpassed as the Icelandic number one by fellow countryman Magn√∫s Ver Magn√∫sson, who won the Iceland's Strongest Man title in 1988 and 1989 and continued Sigmarsson's legacy by emulating his 4 World's Strongest Man title wins during the 90's. Two other famous quotes of J√≥n P√°ll's are \\"I am in seventh heaven\\", which was his translation of an Icelandic saying, and \\"Ekkert m√°l fyrir J√≥n P√°l\\", which translates as \\"No problem for J√≥n P√°ll\\". J√≥n P√°ll remained an icon for the Strongman sport. His charm and charisma off stage made him a crowd favourite and his supreme strength was manifested in his infamous and exuberant Viking chanted performances on stage. With four Worlds Strongest Man titles, J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson is one of the five most successful competitors in the history of the contest. He is only equaled by Magn√∫s Ver Magn√∫sson, ≈Ωydr≈´nas Savickas, and Brian Shaw with four titles and surpassed by Mariusz Pudzianowski with five titles. J√≥n P√°ll was also one of a few strongmen who possessed the genetics that allowed him to master all forms of strength. He was able to master the Olympic weightlifting lifts as well as exert tremendous static strength that allowed him to defeat some of the greatest powerlifters of all time. This combination of strength manifested well in World's Strongest Man, leaving no chinks in his armour. Coupled with strength training he also achieved feats in the Bodybuilding world. This included his famous bodybuilding and strongman wins in 1988, where he had to contrast his heavy strongman training and bulk of up to with a cutting up phase to for the bodybuilding contests. His weight remained consistently around for the World Strongest Man contests, where versatility would be compromised by heavy bodyweights, a point emphasized by Ab Wolders of the Netherlands in 1989, a fellow competitor. J√≥n P√°ll weighed his heaviest during Pure Strength 1987 at a weight of . J√≥n P√°ll was namechecked in Iceland's entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 1988, \\"S√≥krates\\" by Sverrir Stormsker. He was also shown, among the artists competing, in a short videoclip at the opening of the Contest. Compere at the Contest, Pat Kenny, claimed he was brought along by the Icelandic delegation for reasons of security. Hjalti √Årnason, a lifelong friend of J√≥n P√°ll's, created the J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson Classic international strongman contest in 2010 in honor of J√≥n P√°ll. The event is held annually during the Icelandic fitness & health expo in Reykjav√≠k, the inaugural winner was America's Brian Shaw in 2010. J√≥n P√°ll was described in his life documentary \\"Larger than Life\\" by one of his former rivals Geoff Capes as \\"a new kind of guy on the block\\" and by David Webster equally in describing him as a man who boasted pure static strength as well as versatile athletic strength in all its forms, a combination that lead to his supreme performances. After battling with the injuries sustained during 1988, 1989, and 1990, which had affected his athleticism, his strength became progressively more static in his later years. Jon Pall was often challenged by fellow competitor Bill Kazmaier in feats of statically oriented events between contests because he believed the events were biased in J√≥n P√°ll's favour. This included Kaz challenging Jon Pall to a sledgehammer hold during Pure Strength 1987 where J√≥n P√°ll beat Kazmaier. Kazmaier had travelled to Nigeria for a strength exhibition with Douglas Edmunds to break the deadlift world record by deadlifting with straps, Jon Pall then re-broke the record with a lift of in his gym in Iceland in front of spectators in 1987 at his heaviest bodyweight in preparation for Pure Strength 1987. Personal life and death Although he was known for his energetic and boastful personality when competing, J√≥n P√°ll was a soft-spoken and bookish man in his personal life. J√≥n P√°ll had one son, Sigmar Freyr (born 1983). On 16 January 1993, J√≥n P√°ll died of an aortic rupture while deadlifting in his gym, Gym 80 in Reykjav√≠k.Revealed: Secrets of the World's Third Strongest Man This was likely the result of a congenital heart defect that affected other members of his family, which may have been exacerbated by his use of anabolic steroids.Stera√¶√∞i √° √çslandi He had sought medical treatment in the United States the previous year due to heart problems. In S√∂lvi Tryggvason's 2013 biography of J√≥n P√°ll he stated he suspected J√≥n P√°ll knew he was close to death.

Bacteria and archaea serve as natural hosts. There are currently 783 species in this family, divided among 265 genera and 13 subfamilies. The characteristic structural features of this family are a nonenveloped head and noncontractile tail. Structure Viruses in Siphoviridae are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and head-tail geometries (morphotype B1) or a prolate capsid (morphotype B2), and T=7 symmetry. The diameter is around 60 nm. Members of this family are also characterized by their filamentous, cross-banded, noncontractile tails, usually with short terminal and subterminal fibers. Genomes are double stranded and linear, around 50kb in length, containing about 70 genes. The guanine/cytosine content is usually around 52%. Life cycle Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by adsorption into the host cell. Replication follows the replicative transposition model. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting, and +1 ribosomal frameshifting. The virus exits the host cell by lysis, and holin/endolysin/spanin proteins. Bacteria and archaea serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion.

The Canadian Encyclopedia, September 3, 2008. Located near Casa Loma, the theatre was founded by Bill and Jane Glassco in 1970. Bill Glassco was the artistic director from 1971 to 1982. In 1982, Urjo Kareda took over as artistic director and remained in that role until his death in December 2001. Richard Rose was appointed artistic director in July 2002, and Camilla Holland was appointed general manager in July 2006. In 1987, Tarragon purchased and renovated the building that has been its home since 1971. There are two playing spaces: Mainspace (205 seats), The Extra Space (113 seats). Tarragon is well known for its development, creation and encouragement of new work. Over 170 works have premiered at Tarragon. Playwrights who have premiered their work here include Morwyn Brebner, David French, Michael Healey, Joan MacLeod, Morris Panych, James Reaney, Jason Sherman, Brendan Gall, Hannah Moscovich and Judith Thompson. Background The theatre is housed in a building originally designed for light industrial use - for instance, it was once a cribbage board factory. It has championed the work of Canadian playwrights David French, Michel Tremblay, Judith Thompson, Jason Sherman, Michael Healey and others, as well as productions of plays by canonical playwrights such as Anton Chekhov and August Strindberg. The theatre holds two performances venues, containing approximately 200 and 100 seats respectively. One of their rehearsal halls can also be used as a performance area, seating 60.

The area takes its name from the Downs View farm established around 1842 near the present-day intersection of Keele Street and Wilson Avenue. It now extends beyond the intersection of Sheppard Avenue and Dufferin Street (the latter which is bypassed by Allen Road in the vicinity of the intersection), though it is popularly seen as including the areas to the north right up to the Toronto city limit at Steeles Avenue. The area includes several large post-World War II subdivisions. Within the area is Downsview Airport, the former site of Canadian Forces Base Downsview, which has since been largely converted following the end of the Cold War into an urban park known as Downsview Park. The airport is still used as a manufacturing and testing facility for Bombardier Aerospace. Description Downsview United Church was erected in the neighbourhood in 1870. From the east side of Dufferin Street to areas to the east, the area is primarily residential, while to the west, the district is industrial. In the western section is the large Downsview Park district which has served as a military base but is now being redeveloped into parkland and mixed uses. West of Downsview Park, are several residential subdivisions. Most of the houses in Downsview were built immediately post-war and into the 1960s, though some houses and condos have been recently built near Sheppard West station. North of Downsview Park is a large industrial-commercial area. Immediately beside Dufferin Street, William R. Allen Road brings large traffic volumes from the Ontario Highway 401 exit to the south. The main arterial streets are Sheppard Avenue and Wilson Avenue running east-west and Keele Street and Jane Street running north-south. The major streets have retail businesses along the frontage and the businesses along Wilson Avenue south of Downsview Park have organized the Wilson Village BIA. There is a large \\"big box\\" retail area south of Wilson between Dufferin Street and Allen Road. History The area is named for the farm settled by Justice of the Peace John Perkins Bull called Downs View in 1842 near Keele Street and Rustic Road, then in York County, Upper Canada. For over a century, the area was an agricultural community with a post office, schoolhouse, and general store. The center of the community was the Downsview United Church on Keele Street, which was erected in 1870 and designated a Toronto Heritage Property in 2008. Other historical landmarks from this period include The George Jackson House, which was also designated heritage property. In 1850, the area became part of York Township, and in 1927, became part of North York Township, which eventually became the City of North York. In 1998, the area became part of the city of Toronto. In April 1929, William De Havilland bought of farmland to build a manufacturing facility for De Havilland Canada. The facility was expanded during the 1930s and particularly during the Second World War, and became Canada's largest supplier of military, civilian and government-owned aircraft, as well as the site of several aviation firsts and record-breaking flights. In the early Cold War period, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) built up the area as a major air station and logistics support base. In 1954, the RCAF built a large supply depot that serves as the central stores for the RCAF. The building currently houses the Downsview Park Merchant's Market. In the 1950s, the Ontario provincial government developed the Downsview Complex, which presently houses a number of provincial offices, as well as a detachment from the Ontario Provincial Police. In 1969, a large residential complex of five 19-storey high apartment buildings, known as Jane-Exbury Towers, was completed in 1969. Designed by architect Uno Prii, they are noted for their mid-century expressionist features. The Ontario Provincial Police's garage depot in Downsview, 1979 The military base and the de Havilland company, including the runway and all buildings, was closed and sold to Bombardier Aerospace in 1994. Bombardier has been manufacturing and testing commercial aircraft on the site since then. Some 1000 de Havilland DH 98 Mosquito aircraft were built by the company at Downsview during the Second World War. On August 10, 2008, just before 4 a.m., massive explosions occurred at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases propane facility, at 54 Murray Rd., located immediately north-east of the intersection of Keele Street and Wilson Avenue. An employee of the facility and a firefighter were killed as a result of the explosions. Mayor David Miller had publicly expressed his condolences to the families of the victims shortly thereafter. Redevelopment of the Downsview Complex began in 2011. The redevelopment of the complex saw the completion of the Humber River Hospital, which was opened in 2015. The acute care hospital is situated on Wilson Avenue and Keele Street. Demographics Major ethnic populations (2016): * 42.6% White; 23.4% Italian, 5.2% Portuguese * 15.5% Black; 6.7% Jamaican * 13.7% Filipino * 10.3% Latin American (of any race) * 3.9% South Asian * 3.6% East Indian Education Two public school boards operate schools in Downsview, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Both school boards also operate a public secondary schools in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates Madonna Catholic Secondary School, an all-girls secondary school, whereas TDSB operates Downsview Secondary School. TCDSB and TDSB also operate several public institutions in Downsview that offer primary education. They include: * Ancaster Public School (TDSB) * Beverley Heights Middle School (TDSB) * Blaydon Public School (TDSB) * Calico Public School (TDSB) * Chalkfarm Public School (TDSB) * Downsview Public School (TDSB) * Highview Public School (TDSB) * Pierre Laporte Middle School (TDSB) * St. Andre Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Conrad Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Martha Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Norbert Catholic School (TCDSB) * St. Raphael Catholic School (TCDSB) * Tumpane Public School (TDSB) The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Downsview, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. CSCM and CSV students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. The neighbourhood is also home to Centennial College's Downsview Aerospace campus. The college is a post-secondary institution, with several campuses throughout Toronto. Recreation Downsview Park is a large urban park operated by the Government of Canada. Several municipal parks are situated in Downsview, including Chalkfarm Park, Downsview Dells Park, Oakdale Village Park, and Roding Park. Roding Park is an park near Wilson Avenue and Keele Street. Recreational facilities in the park include a baseball diamond, two tennis courts, four bocce courts and a children's playground. Downsview Dells Park is a large park which features wilderness and wetland settings with picnic areas and fire pits. Car parking and washrooms are available within the park. Within the park is Downsview Dells House, a municipal drug and alcohol treatment facility. A number of these parks are situated near the valley of the Black Creek, as it flows south and west from Sheppard Avenue midway between Keele and Jane Streets. The valley forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks in Downsview are maintained by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In addition to parks, the division also operates several community centres in the neighbourhood, including Ancaster Community Centre, Chalkfarm Community Centre, and Roding Community Centre. The Toronto Public Library operates two branches in the neighbourhood, Black Creek branch, and Downsview branch. The Government of Canada also maintains an urban park in the neighbourhood, known as Downsview Park. The park was formerly used by the Canadian Armed Forces, as CFB Toronto. The park houses several recreational facilities, including practice facilities for the Toronto FC. Downsview Park has also hosted several large public events, including a Papal Mass, attended by 800,000 people on 28 July 2002. The mass was led by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day. On 30 July 2003, the park also hosted a massive concert known as Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert was held in support of the City of Toronto after the 2003 SARS outbreak there. Transportation A bus operated by the Toronto Transit Commission leaves Wilson subway station in Downsview. Several major roadways serve as the boundary for Downsview, with Sheppard Avenue to the north, Allen Road to the east, Highway 401 to the south, and Highway 400 to the west. The latter two roadways are major controlled access highways that form a part of the province's 400-series highways network. Portions of Allen Road adjacent to Downsview also operate as a controlled access highway, although it is maintained by the City of Toronto, and not the provincial government. Other major thoroughfares in the neighbourhood include Keele Street, a major north-south roadway that runs through Downsview. Public transportation in Downsview is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC operates several bus routes through the neighbourhood, as well as the Toronto subway. Line 1 of the subway system has two stops in the neighbourhood, Wilson station and Downsview Park station. Another stop on Line 1, Sheppard West station, is situated adjacent of the neighbourhood, on the eastern side of Allen Road. Regional train service by GO Transit stops at the Downsview Park Station.

The resort is owned by Alterra Mountain Company. The mountain and resort are part of the Mont-Tremblant National Park and are both located near the village of Mont- Tremblant. History Development Hotels in the winter Joseph Bondurant Ryan, an explorer from a wealthy American family from Philadelphia, came to the region prospecting gold in 1938. Accompanied by Harry Wheeler (founder of the Gray Rocks Inn in Mont Tremblant) and Lowell Thomas, the American journalist, they climbed to the summit of Mont Tremblant with skis wrapped in seal skins for traction. After an exhausting trek to the summit, it's said that Joseph Ryan vowed to transform the landscape into a world-class alpine village. Only one year later, his dream was realized. On February 12, 1939, Joseph Ryan opened the Mont Tremblant Lodge, which remains part of the pedestrian village today. In its early years, Lowell Thomas, the American radio broadcaster, was an avid skier who helped popularize the resort by broadcasting shows from the site, thereby establishing the resort as a prime destination for skiers. The resort named a triple ski lift, which is located on the north mountainside, and trails after him as well as other early devotees. Following the sudden death of Joseph Bondurant Ryan in 1950, the Mont Tremblant ski resort was operated by his wife Mary Rutherfoord Johnson Ryan until 1965, when it was sold to local Quebec entrepreneurs led by Andr√© Charron. They ran the resort until 1979, when they sold to La Soci√©t√© des Caisses d'Entraide √âconomique. They ran the resort for four years until it went into bankruptcy. The resort was then bought in 1983 by Louis-Pierre Lapointe, who in turn sold it in 1991 to Intrawest. Intrawest immediately expanded the pedestrian resort village with architecture reminiscent of traditional Quebec and built new ski lifts, including a gondola. Other changes included building the Grand Manitou summit lodge. In 2009 a casino located at the base of the soleil trails was opened. The casino is serviced by an 8-passenger gondola that runs from the main resort to the casino. Joseph Bondurant Ryan is buried next to the St. Bernard Chappel which he built in 1940-41 at the base of the alpine village, along with his wife Mary and son Peter, who died in Paris, France in 1962 at the age of 22 as a result of an auto racing accident. Peter Ryan was an accomplished champion skier who'd been named to the Canadian Olympic ski team, but had switched to auto racing after a 1959 skiing accident. He quickly showed tremendous talent in auto racing and was the first Canadian in Formula One auto racing and the winner of the first Canadian Grand Prix held at Mosport in 1961. On March 16, 2009, actress Natasha Richardson sustained a head injury when she fell while taking a beginner skiing lesson at the resort. She died two days later in New York City. Since Alterra has taken ownership of the resort in 2018, the resort has seen some major investments. For the winter 2018-2019, a new high speed quad ski lift was installed to replace the old Lowell Thomas Lift. During the summer of 2018, the Manitou Chalet located the top of the mountain has seen significant improvement. The total number of trails is now 102 with several new glade areas. Alterra has already announced another 14 million dollar investment for the 2019-2020 season. New developments will also be taking place on the Soleil Side including a new hotel. Resort facilities Pedestrian village The main resort has more than of ski and snowboarding trails in four distinct areas: North Side (Versant Nord), South Side (Versant Sud), Sunny Side (Versant Soleil) and The Edge (Versant Edge). As of the 2018-2019 winter season, the resort has 102 ski trails. Of those trails, 22 are labelled easy, 34 intermediate, 42 difficult and 15 expert. There are three snow parks and twenty official glades. The resort features 14 ski lifts, consisting of 3 gondolas (including the open-air gondola in the pedestrian village and the T√©l√©cabine Casino Express), 6 detachable chairlifts, 2 regular chairlifts, and 3 magic carpets. An open-air gondola, or cabriolet lift, is used to transport skiers above the village from the parking lot to the bottom of the mountain. The 14 lifts total a 27,230 skiers per hour capacity. The top of the mountain has a chalet and cafeteria, Le Grand Manitou, open winter and summer. Pedestrian village An open-air gondola called the Cabriolet connects the upper and lower parts of the pedestrian village. From the top of this lift, the main gondola is available to take skiers to the summit of the mountain. There is also a ski trail running through the village for skiers to access the lower level of the village and transportation. The Mont Tremblant Resort also has extensive shopping for ski and snowboard enthusiasts. The municipal village of Mont-Tremblant is distant. Activities Mont Tremblant has year-round activities which take advantage of the surrounding environment (mountains, forest, lakes and rivers); most are set up on daily schedules and usually take the form of tours in small groups and are accessible to families; most are run by independent operators or specialized guides. Summer activities include, all-terrain vehicle tours, croisieres, boating, canoeing trips, cycling, dune buggy tours, fishing tours, golf, helicopter tours, hiking, horse back riding, lake cruises, mountain biking, paintball games, rafting, rock climbing school, spas, via ferrata, waterskiing and wakeboarding, white-water rafting, and zip-lines. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, dogsledding, downhill skiing and ski schools, helicopter tours, ice-climbing, ice fishing, ice skating, paintball, sleigh rides, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, tubing, spas and via ferrata. Lodging Mont Tremblant Resort Mont Tremblant has a wide variety of hotel and condo accommodations, many of which are situated in the pedestrian village at the foot of the mountain. There are additional condo and chalet accommodations located adjacent to the pedestrian village which are managed by the resort's rental agency or other private rental agencies. These accommodations feature shuttle bus service which provides guests some of the same convenience afforded to people staying in the pedestrian village. Most condo accommodations at the resort area are privately owned. The resort or rental agencies act as a rental broker for these properties by handling maintenance, reservations and other guest-related tasks on behalf of owners. There are also many privately owned chalets of all levels (from budget to luxury) in the immediate area. Surrounding area Mont Tremblant hotel accommodations The surrounding hills and valleys are filled with trails for cross-country skiing and hiking. The ski trails connect with other ski trails in neighboring towns, making it possible for nature lovers to undertake ski excursions lasting several days going (or coming from) as far south as Blainville, Quebec on the outskirts of Montreal. The network of cross-country ski trails consists of over 100 km of terrain, much of which follows the Diable river and its adjacent coniferous forest. The surrounding valleys of the Mont-Tremblant National Park have small lakes, dense boreal forests and thousands of vacation cottages. There are also world-class golf courses, hiking trails and small rivers suitable for canoeing and swimming. There are many trails for mountain bikes and a special \\"route verte\\" rail trail paved for road bicycle use. The cycling/multifunctional path was built on an abandoned right-of-way of the Montreal-Mont Laurier railway; so cyclists do not have to share a path with motorized vehicles.

He has won the title of World's Strongest Man four times (1991, 1994, 1995, and 1996). Powerlifting Magn√∫s began powerlifting in 1984, and in 1985 he won a medal in the junior European and World Championships. He won the Senior European title in the 125 kg (276 lb) class in 1988 and 1990. His best lifts in competition include a 437.5 kg (964.5 lb) squat, 400 kg (882 lb) raw squat, 275 kg (605 lb) bench press with shirt and 250 kg raw bench press, 375 kg (827 lb) raw deadlift, and a raw total of 1015 kg (2238 lb). He once held the world record for a tire deadlift of 445 kg (981 lb). Strongman Magn√∫s competed in his first strongman contest in 1985, finishing third in the Iceland's Strongest Man competition won by J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson. He decided to focus solely on strongman competition after he won the 1991 World's Strongest Man contest. His strongman victories include the 1989 Pure Strength contest in Scotland, the 1991 and 1993 International Power Challenge, the 1992 Scandinavian Strongest Man (Finland), the 1992 Nordic Strongest Man (Denmark), the 1994 Europe's Strongest Man, the 1995 World Muscle Power Championship, and the 1995 and 1997 Viking Challenge. In addition to his four World's Strongest Man titles, he was also runner-up in 1992 and 1993. He has also won the Iceland's strongest man competition many times and the West coast Viking (Vestfjar√∞av√≠kingurinn) of Iceland nine times. He is considered to be one of the first modern strongman competitors and is regarded by many to be one of the best strongmen of all time. He carried J√≥n P√°ll's formula of being athletic for the dynamic tests of strength and having tremendous static strength to out lift some of the best Powerlifters. He was able to easily out deadlift the favoured O.D Wilson by 40 kg in 1991 and out squatted the world record holder in the squat, Gerrit Badenhorst, in 1995. After Magnus squatted 437.5 kg, Badenhorst commented that he had previously underestimated Magnus' pure strength and that Magnus' squat was the greatest squat he had ever seen from someone of his bodyweight. He competed in a one- off event at the Giants Live Strongman Championship 2019 held in Wembley against fellow strongman legend Bill Kazmaier in the Hercules Hold, with the weight being reduced by 20 kg on each side from what the professional athletes were working with. Despite having not competed in a strongman event since 2004, Magnusson stunned the capacity crowd with a time of 101.2 seconds (1m 41.2s), whilst Kazmaier could only manage just over 18 seconds. Personal life Magn√∫s lives with his wife Magg√Ω M√Ωrdal, who is a company owner of a design store Fonts, her daughter S√≥ld√∂gg Mar√≠a, and his daughter Vera Mist, in K√≥pavogur, Iceland. His older daughter Mar√≠anna lives in Mosfellsb√¶r and is a nurse. Magn√∫s frequently judges international powerlifting and strongman competitions.

Narration is conveyed by a narrator: a specific person or unspecified literary voice, developed by the creator of the story, to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot (the series of events). Narration is a required element of all written stories (novels, short stories, poems, memoirs, etc.), with the function of conveying the story in its entirety. However, narration is merely optional in most other storytelling formats, such as films, plays, television shows, and video games, in which the story can be conveyed through other means, like dialogue between characters or visual action. The narrative mode encompasses the set of choices through which the creator of the story develops their narrator and narration: * Narrative point of view, perspective, or voice: the choice of grammatical person used by the narrator to establish the whether or not the narrator and the audience are participants in the story; also, this includes the scope of the information or knowledge that the narrator presents * Narrative tense: the choice of either the past or present grammatical tense to establish either the prior completion or current immediacy of the plot * Narrative technique: any of the various other methods chosen to help narrate a story, such as establishing the story's setting (location in time and space), developing characters, exploring themes (main ideas or topics), structuring the plot, intentionally expressing certain details but not others, following or subverting genre norms, and using various other storytelling devices and linguistic styles. Thus, narration includes both who tells the story and how the story is told (for example, by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration). The narrator may be anonymous and unspecified, or a character appearing and participating within their own story (whether fictitious or factual), or the author themself as a character. The narrator may merely relate the story to the audience without being involved in the plot and may have varied awareness of characters' thoughts and distant events. Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at various times, creating a story with a complex perspective.  Narrative point of view  There has been an ongoing debate on the nature of narrative point of view. A variety of different theoretical approaches have sought to define point of view in terms of person, perspective, voice, consciousness, and focus. Narrative perspective is the position and character of the storyteller, in relation to the narrative. Literary theory The Russian semiotician Boris Uspensky identifies five planes on which point of view is expressed in a narrative: 1) spatial, 2) temporal, 3) psychological, 4) phraseological, and 5) ideological.Boris Uspensky, A Poetics of Composition: The Structure of the Artistic Text and Typology of Compositional Form, trans. Valentina Zavarin and Susan Wittig (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1973). The American literary critic Susan Sniader Lanser also develops these categories.Susan Sniader Lanser, The Narrative Act: Point of View in Prose Fiction (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. 1981). Spatial point of view is the stance in terms of space from which the narrator tells the story. The narrator may be outside the narrative or within the story as a character. Or the narrator may be an observer that records events and happenings similar to a roving camera and montage. Whatever the spatial stance of the narrator, it conveys a point of view to the reader. The spatial position of the narrator may create for the reader affinity to a character's point of view, or it can have the opposite effect of establishing distance from a character's perspective.James L. Resseguie, \\"Point of View,\\" in How John Works: Storytelling in the Fourth Gospel, ed. Douglas Estes and Ruth Sheridan (Atlanta: SBL Press, 2016), 83-5. Temporal point of view can refer to narrative tense, or it can refer to how detailed or summarized the narration is. For example, when events are narrated after they have occurred (posterior narration), the narrator is in a privileged position to the characters in the story and can delve into the deeper significance of events and happenings, pointing out the missteps and missed meanings of the characters. Temporal point of view also focuses on the pace of narration. Narrative pace can either be accelerated or slowed down. Narrative retardation (slowing down of narration) foregrounds events and suggests what is to be noticed by the reader, whereas summation or acceleration of narrative pace places events and happenings in the background, diminishing their importance. Psychological point of view focuses on characters' behaviors. Lanser concludes that this is \\"an extremely complex aspect of point of view, for it encompasses the broad question of the narrator's distance or affinity to each character and event‚Ä¶represented in the text.\\"Lanser, 201-202. Negative comments distance the reader from a character's point of view while positive evaluations create affinity with his or her perspective. Phraseological point of view focuses on the speech characteristics of characters and the narrator. For example, the names, titles, epithets, and sobriquets given to a character may evaluate a character's actions or speech and express a narrative point of view. Ideological point of view is not only \\"the most basic aspect of point of view\\" but also the \\"least accessible to formalization, for its analysis relies to a degree, on intuitive understanding.\\"Uspensky, 8. This aspect of point of view focuses on the norms, values, beliefs, and Weltanschauung (worldview) of the narrator or a character. The ideological point of view may be stated outright‚Äîwhat Lanser calls \\"explicit ideology\\"‚Äîor it may be embedded at \\"deep- structural\\" levels of the text and not easily identified.Lanser, 216-17. The Gospel of John is an example of explicit ideologyResseguie, How John Works, 93-95. while Virginia Woolf's The Waves expresses an ideological point of view that is deeply embedded in the narrative.Lanser, 216-17.  First-person  A first-person point of view reveals the story through an openly self- referential and participating narrator. First person creates a close relationship between the narrator and reader, by referring to the viewpoint character with first person pronouns like I and me (as well as we and us, whenever the narrator is part of a larger group). That is, the narrator openly acknowledges their own existence. Frequently, the first-person narrator is the protagonist, whose inner thoughts are expressed to the audience, even if not to any of the other characters. A first person narrator with a limited perspective is not able to witness or understand all facets of any situation. Thus, a narrator with this perspective will not be able to report the circumstances fully and will leave the reader with a subjective record of the plot details. Additionally, this narrator's character could be pursuing a hidden agenda or may be struggling with mental or physical challenges that further hamper their ability to tell the reader the whole, accurate truth of events. This form includes temporary first-person narration as a story within a story, wherein a narrator or character observing the telling of a story by another is reproduced in full, temporarily and without interruption shifting narration to the speaker. The first-person narrator can also be the focal character. The viewpoint character is not necessarily the focal character: examples of supporting viewpoint characters include Doctor Watson, Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, and Nick Carraway of The Great Gatsby.  Second-person  The second-person point of view is a point of view where the audience is made a character. This is done with the use of second-person pronouns like you. The narrator may be literally addressing the audience, but more often the second-person referent of these stories is actually some character within the story. Novels in second person are comparatively rare; rather, this point of view tends to be mostly confined to songs and poems. Nevertheless, some notable examples include the novel Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas by Tom Robbins, the short fiction of Lorrie Moore and Junot D√≠az, the short story The Egg by Andy Weir, and in French, Second Thoughts by Michel Butor. > \\"You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time > of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is > entirely unfamiliar, although the details are fuzzy.\\"‚ÄîOpening lines of Jay > McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City (1984) The Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks are written in second person. Text- based interactive fiction, such as Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork, conventionally has descriptions written in the second person (though exceptions exist), telling the character what they are seeing and doing. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from Spiderweb Software, which make ample use of second person flavor text in pop up text boxes with character and location descriptions. Charles Stross's novel Halting State was written in second person as an allusion to this style.  Third-person  In the third-person narrative mode, the narration refers to all characters with third person pronouns like he, she, or they, and never first- or second-person pronouns. This makes it clear the narration is done without the need for a narrator who is identified and personified as a character within the story. For the purpose of comparison to stories that have a narrator, third-person narration is described as having an anonymous narrator. Traditionally, third-person narration is the most commonly used narrative mode in literature. It does not require that the narrator's existence be explained or developed as a particular character, as would be the case with a first-person narrator. It thus allows a story to be told without detailing any information about the teller (narrator) of the story. Instead, a third-person narrator is often simply some disembodied commentary, rather than a fully developed character. Sometimes, third-person narration is called the \\"he/she\\" perspective, and, on even rarer occasions, author/omniscient point of view. The third-person modes are usually categorized along two axes. The first is the subjectivity/objectivity axis, with third person subjective narration involving one or more characters' personal feelings and thoughts, and third person objective narration not describing the feelings or thoughts of any characters but, rather, just the exact facts of the story. Third-person modes may also be categorized along the omniscient/limited axis. A third person omniscient narrator conveys information from multiple characters, places, and events of the story, including any given characters' thoughts, and a third person limited narrator conveys the knowledge and subjective experience of just one character. Third person narration, in both its limited and omniscient variants, became the most popular narrative perspective during the 20th century.  Omniscient or limited  Omniscient point of view is presented by a narrator with an overarching perspective, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. This narrative point of view has been the most commonly used in narrative writing; it is seen in countless classic novels, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy, and George Eliot. It sometimes even takes a subjective approach. One advantage of narrative omniscience is that it enhances the sense of objective reliability (that is, apparent truthfulness) of the plot, which may be important with more complex narratives. The third-person omniscient narrator is the least capable of being unreliable‚Äîalthough the character of omniscient narrator can have its own personality, offering judgments and opinions on the behavior of the story characters. Many stories, especially in literature, alternate from one character to another at chapter boundaries, such as in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. The Home and the World, written in 1916 by Rabindranath Tagore, is another example of a book switching among just three characters at chapter boundaries. In The Heroes of Olympus series, the point of view alternates between characters at intervals. The Harry Potter series focuses on the protagonist for much of the seven novels, but deviates to other characters on occasions, particularly during the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, the Muggle Prime Minister in the Half-Blood Prince). Limited third-person point of view is used by an anonymous narrator who follows one character's perspective. This is the most common narrative point of view in literature since the early 20th century. Examples include the Harry Potter books and J.M. Coetzee‚Äôs Disgrace.  Subjective or objective  Subjective point of view is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of one or more characters. If this is just one character, it can be termed third-person limited, in which the reader is limited to the thoughts of some particular character (often the protagonist) as in the first-person mode, except still giving personal descriptions using third-person pronouns. This is almost always the main character (for example, Gabriel in James Joyce's The Dead, Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown, or Santiago in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea). Certain third-person omniscient modes are also classifiable as using the third person, subjective mode when they switch between the thoughts and feelings of all the characters. In contrast to the broad, sweeping perspectives seen in many 19th-century novels, third-person subjective is sometimes called the \\"over the shoulder\\" perspective; the narrator only describes events perceived and information known by a character. At its narrowest and most subjective scope, the story reads as though the viewpoint character were narrating it; dramatically this is very similar to the first person, in that it allows in-depth revelation of the protagonist's personality, but it uses third-person grammar. Some writers will shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, such as in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, or George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Free indirect speech is the presentation of a character's thoughts in the voice of the third-person narrator. Objective point of view employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character's thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view. Often the narrator is self-dehumanized in order to make the narrative more neutral. This type of narrative mode is often seen outside of fiction in newspaper articles, biographical documents, and scientific journals. This narrative mode can be described as a \\"fly-on-the-wall\\" or \\"camera lens\\" approach that can only record the observable actions but does not interpret these actions or relay what thoughts are going through the minds of the characters. Works of fiction that use this style emphasize characters acting out their feelings observably. Internal thoughts, if expressed, are given through an aside or soliloquy. While this approach does not allow the author to reveal the unexpressed thoughts and feelings of the characters, it does allow the author to reveal information that not all or any of the characters may be aware of. An example of this so-called camera-eye perspective is \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\" by Ernest Hemingway. This narrative mode is also called third-person dramatic because the narrator, like the audience of a drama, is neutral and ineffective toward the progression of the plot‚Äîmerely an uninvolved onlooker.  Alternating person  While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have utilized other points of view that, for example, alternate between different first-person narrators or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative mode. The ten books of the Pendragon adventure series, by D. J. MacHale, switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey as well as a disembodied third-person perspective focused on his friends back home.White, Claire E (2004). \\"A Conversation With D.J. MacHale.\\" The Internet Writing Journal. Writer Write, Inc. Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace provides one character's viewpoint from first-person as well as another character's from third-person limited. Often, a narrator using the first person will try to be more objective by also employing the third person for important action scenes, especially those in which they are not directly involved or in scenes where they are not present to have viewed the events in firsthand. This mode is found in Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible. In William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying, even the perspective of a deceased person is included. Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife alternates between an art student named Clare, and a librarian named Henry. John Green & David Levithan's novel Will Grayson, Will Grayson rotates between two boys both named Will Grayson. It alternates between both boys telling their part of the story, how they meet and how their lives then come together. Nick Hornby's A Long Way Down has four narrators, who also are its main characters. These four characters meet at the top of a tall building known as \\"the suicide spot\\" and begin to talk instead of jumping. They then form a group and continue to meet up.  Narrative tense In narrative past tense, the events of the plot occur before the narrator's present. This is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. This could be in the narrator's distant past or their immediate past, which for practical purposes is the same as their present. Past tense can be used regardless of whether the setting is in the reader's past, present, or future. In narratives using present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring in the narrator's current moment of time. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Present tense can also be used to narrate events in the reader's past. This is known as \\"historical present\\". This tense is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the narrator's present. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of their future, so many future-tense stories have a prophetic tone. Narrative technique  Stream-of-consciousness  Stream of consciousness gives the (typically first-person) narrator's perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes‚Äîas opposed to simply the actions and spoken words‚Äîof the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators' feelings in William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying, and the character Offred's often fragmented thoughts in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Irish writer James Joyce exemplifies this style in his novel Ulysses.  Unreliable narrator  Unreliable narration involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; however, a third- person narrator may be unreliable. An example is J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, in which the novel's narrator Holden Caulfield is biased, emotional, and juvenile, divulging or withholding certain information deliberately and at times probably quite unreliable.

He died in a car accident in 1997 in Recife, Pernambuco, at the age of 30. Biography Francisco de Assis Fran√ßa was born in the Rio Doce neighbourhood of Olinda, Pernambuco, in Brazil's Northeast Region. As a little boy he would sell crabs that he caught himself in the city's mangrove swamps. He became the lead singer and major creative driving force of the groundbreaking Mangue Bit band called Chico Science & Na√ß√£o Zumbi (CSNZ). Influenced by such musicians as James Brown, Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow, their music cleverly fused rock, funk, and hip hop with maracatu and other traditional rhythms of Brazil's Northeast. World music critics found his music \\"original and distinctive of his region.\\" Chico had a powerful stage presence that was compared by some to that of Jimi Hendrix. Around 1991, Chico Science, along with singer Fred 04 of the band Mundo Livre S/A, founded the Mangue Bit cultural movement in response to dire economic and cultural stagnation in Recife and Olinda. CSNZ made their US debut at New York's Central Park Summerstage in 1995, opening for Gilberto Gil, with whom he collaborated during the encore. While in NY, they also performed additional shows at CBGB's, SOB's and at Bryant Park as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, on a bill with the Ohio Players. Chico Science & Na√ß√£o Zumbi toured several times in Europe and brought massive attention to the new generation of Brazilian artists in the 1990s. With only two full albums released during his lifetime, 'Da Lama Ao Caos' ('From Mud To Chaos) and 'Afrociberdelia', his influence and vision became the foundation to a whole new generation of musicians in Brazil. At the time of his death, The New York Times said he was \\"widely hailed as the future of Brazilian music.\\" The Governor of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco declared three days of mourning. In 1996, Chico Science contributed Maracatu At√¥mico along with Na√ß√£o Zumbi to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization. Na√ß√£o Zumbi have continued to record and tour internationally after Chico's death.  Death  Chico Science died in a car accident on February 2, 1997. He lost control of his Fiat Uno and hit a side light post after another car cut him off. He was rescued alive but he did not survive his injuries. He was buried on February 3 in Cemit√©rio de Santo Amaro located in Recife. Discography *1994: Da lama ao caos *1996: Afrociberdelia *1998: CSNZ (posthumous) References Sneed, P. M. (2019).

OM, as it is known, started in Mexico and had spread to Europe and India by 1963. OM currently has 6,800 people working in 118 countries \\"https://www.omusa.org/page/what-is-om\\" around the world, seeking to \\"see vibrant communities of Jesus followers among the least reached\\".\\"https://www.om.org/us/en/content/about-om\\" OM's core values are knowing and glorifying God, living in submission to God's Word, being people of grace & integrity, serving sacrificially, loving & valuing people, evangelising the world, reflecting the diversity of the body of Christ, global intercession, and esteeming the church. They accomplish these core values through church planting, evangelism, relief and development, justice, and mentoring and discipleship.  History  George Verwer, OM's founder and leader until 2003, received a Gospel of John from a local woman while still in high school in the 1950s. In 1955, Verwer became a Christian at a Billy Graham meeting at Madison Square Garden, and made a commitment to global missions and spreading God's Word on a massive scale.\\"https://georgeverwer.com/\\" Operation Mobilisation started in 1957 when Walter Borchard, Dale Rhoton and George Verwer traveled to Mexico to distribute Christian literature and Gospels. The Gospels were very important to the men and the beginning of OM's long history. The trip in 1957 was the first of three summer trips to Mexico. By 1960, the men turned their attention to Europe, focusing on mobilising the national churches to global missions. Verwer's vision for the global mission was that leadership would come from the local Christian community, wherever possible, rather than from foreigners (Randall 2008). In Summer 1962 OM's first short- term missions teams moved into Europe, coming from the UK, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, the US and elsewhere. In the summer of 1963 more than 2,000 people blanketed Europe to encourage Christians and to carry God's Word throughout the continent and find creative ways of getting it behind the Iron Curtain. OM teams were also starting in India and the Middle East in 1963 (Randall 2008). OM and Verwer's vision for spreading the Gospel expanded to the seas with the purchase of the ship MV Logos in October 1970. Thereafter OM expanded its ships ministry with the MV Doulos,\\"http://www.gbaships.org/en/history-heritage\\" MV Logos II and MV Logos Hope. Currently only the latter ship is operating, with the previous three having been retired. Back in Europe, summer conferences were continuing but the number of participants was dwindling. In late 1987, a renewed vision for reaching Europe was born, which led to the ‚ÄúLove Europe‚Äù outreaches that started in July 1989, just prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain. OM planned for 5,000 young people from 50 nations to participate; in fact, about 7,000 from 76 nations came. With this first ‚ÄúLove Europe‚Äù conference, the vision of OM ‚Äì birthed in Europe ‚Äì had been renewed (Randall 2008). OM's operations in Europe today includes ministry in more than 30 countries. On 7 March 2013, OM appointed a new international director, only the third in its nearly 56-year history. Lawrence Tong, from Singapore, took over the OM leadership from Peter Maiden, from the UK, who had served and led in the role since 2003. Lawrence, who has served as director of OM's ship Logos II, assumed responsibility on 1 September 2013. OM Ships Currently, OM Ships operates one ship serving destinations around the world, the MV Logos Hope. Their first ship, MV Logos, ran aground on rocks off Tierra del Fuego, Chile, in atrocious weather conditions in 1988. Although the ship could not be saved, not a single crew member was lost or injured. The skeletal hulk of the ship is still visible and has become something of a tourist attraction over the years. Over a 17-year period, more than 6.5 million people visited MV Logos during 408 ports of call in 108 countries. Later in 1988, the former Antonio Lazaro became the MV Logos II, which was retired in July 2008. OM's third ship, the MV Doulos, previously held the record for the oldest ocean-going ship still in service. She was retired at the end of 2009. MV Logos Hope was launched into service in 2009. Twice the size of the MV Doulos, it provides much greater capacity to serve communities. The OM ships have visited port cities throughout the world, supplying literature, encouraging cross-cultural understanding, training young people for more effective life and service, providing relief, and sharing a message of hope in God wherever there is an opportunity. Since 1970, OM's ships have visited 480 different ports in 151 countries and territories around the globe. In total, over 45 million visitors have come aboard to purchase from the selection of 5,000 titles available in the ships' floating bookstores. Titles cover a wide range of subjects, such as science, sports, hobbies, cookery, the arts, philosophy, medicine and children's books, as well as faith and life. The books have been carefully chosen to be of interest to every member of the family, and with the educational, social and moral needs of the local community in mind. Books are on offer at a fraction of their retail value, and, while in certain ports, books are also donated.

Exhibition Place is a publicly owned mixed-use district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located by the shoreline of Lake Ontario, just west of downtown. The site includes exhibit, trade, and banquet centres, theatre and music buildings, monuments, parkland, sports facilities, and a number of civic, provincial, and national historic sites. The district's facilities are used year-round for exhibitions, trade shows, public and private functions, and sporting events. From mid-August through Labour Day each year, the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), from which the name Exhibition Place is derived, is held on the grounds. During the CNE, Exhibition Place encompasses , expanding to include nearby parks and parking lots. The CNE uses the buildings for exhibits on agriculture, food, arts and crafts, government and trade displays. For entertainment, the CNE provides a midway of rides and games, music concerts at the Bandshell, featured shows at the Coliseum, and the Canadian International Air Show. The fair is one of the largest and most successful of its kind in North America and an important part of the culture of Toronto. The buildings on the site date from the 1700s to recent years. Five buildings on the site (the Fire Hall/Police Station, Government Building, Horticulture Building, Music Building and Press Building), were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988.Gouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaGouinlock Buildings / Early Exhibition Buildings, National Register of Historic Places The grounds have seen a mix of protection for heritage buildings along with new development. The site was originally set aside for military purposes and gradually given over to exhibition purposes. One military building remains. The site View of Exhibition Place from the CN Tower in 2013. The site is situated along the shoreline of Lake Ontario, east of the Humber Bay. Exhibition Place is a rectangular site located length-wise along the north shoreline of Lake Ontario to the west of downtown Toronto. The site is mostly flat ground sloping down gently to the shoreline. It was originally forested land, and was cleared for military use. Sections east of Stanley Barracks and south were filled in the early part of the 20th century. Today, the district is mostly paved, with an area of parkland remaining in its western section. There is a large open paved area in the southern central section, which is used for parking and the temporary amusements of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). The site has a variety of historic buildings, open spaces and monuments. The eastern entrance to Exhibition Place is marked by the large ceremonial Princes' Gates, named for Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother, Prince George, who visited in 1927. The roads are all named after Canadian provinces and territories except for Princes' Boulevard which is the main street east-west. Several of the roads are used for the annual Honda Indy Toronto car race. South of the grounds is Ontario Place, a theme park built in 1971 on landfill in Lake Ontario, and operated by the government of Ontario. The site also has a long history of sports facilities on the site, starting with an equestrian track and grandstand. The grandstand eventually was converted for use by music concerts, major league baseball and football teams. The newest sports facility to be built is the soccer-specific stadium, BMO Field. There is also an arena, the Coliseum, home to professional ice hockey. The site was used for several sports venues of the 2015 Pan American Games. The site is administered by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place, appointed by the City of Toronto government. As of 2014, the organization had 133 full-time employees, up to 700 during major events, contributed $11 million annually to the City of Toronto, and attracted 5.3 million visitors annually to the site. The grounds are in area.  History of the grounds  French fur traders established Fort Rouill√© at Exhibition Place in 1750. The small fort Fort Rouill√© was built by French fur traders in 1750-1751 as a trading post on the site of today's grounds. The area was an important portage route for Native Americans, and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario. When the Town of York, the predecessor of Toronto, was inaugurated in the 1790s, the land to the east and west of the garrison (later Fort York) was reserved for military purposes. This includes all of today's Exhibition Place. Years later, the British military decided to replace Fort York with New Fort York (later the Stanley Barracks), to be located to the west of the existing fort. To finance this, the military sold the eastern half of the reserve. In 1840-1841, they constructed a series of six limestone buildings and several smaller ones. The fort was surrounded by a wood fence as elaborate defensive works were never built. The fort was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870, which named it Stanley Barracks in 1893. Crystal Palace in London, was erected for the 1858 fair. The Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for Canada West inaugurated the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 fair, to be held in Toronto, a permanent \\"Palace of Industry\\" exhibition building, based on London's Crystal Palace, was built at King and Shaw Streets in what is now Liberty Village. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s when the City of Toronto government decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today's Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the Massey Manufacturing Company. The 1878 Provincial Agricultural Fair was held on the grounds. When Ottawa was chosen to host the 1879 fair, Toronto decided to hold its own fair. First called the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, it was held in the Crystal Palace and temporary buildings. At first, the eastern part of the site was still reserved for military purposes, the exhibition held on the western part of the reserve, where many of the oldest exhibit buildings are located. As time went by, more and more of the reserve was taken over for exhibition purposes, including a horse track and grandstand, and exhibit buildings. Development of permanent buildings The Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate archway in 1910. In 1902, after the Government of Canada announced it would sponsor a major exhibition at the site in 1903, the Toronto City Council decided to rebuild the exhibition site. In 1903, the Government of Canada reached an agreement to transfer the remaining military reserve to the City of Toronto. Under the agreement, military uses were permitted to continue until such time that replacement facilities were built. Included in this was Old Fort York, which the City committed to preserve. The building campaign saw the building of fifteen permanent buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock from 1903 until 1912, including the surviving Press Building, Horticulture Building, Government Building, Music Building and Fire Hall / Police Station. The new buildings were elaborately designed and set in an attractively landscaped site. At the conclusion of the building campaign, the name was officially changed to the Canadian National Exhibition. The five remaining buildings were declared a historic site in 1988. Several of the older buildings were lost to fire during this time, including the first Grandstand and the Crystal Palace (known as the Transportation Building) in 1906. In 1910, the Dufferin Gates were replaced with a more elaborate arch and out-buildings on each side. During World War I, the Government Building was used as a barracks for soldiers, and a tent camp was set up on the site of the current Ontario Government Building (now Liberty Grand). The Dufferin Gates were patrolled by soldiers. When the CNE became the world's largest annual fair in 1920, a 50-year plan was launched following the urban design and architectural precedents of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Chapman and Oxley prepared the 1920 plan, which emphasized Beaux-Arts architecture and City Beautiful urban design. The Empire Court was to be a monumental central space with a triumphal arch and gates and monumental exhibition buildings with courtyards. The Coliseum was opened in 1921 to host the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. During the 1920s, the exhibition grounds were expanded to the west and to the east, as well as to the south, where reclaimed land was used to build Lake Shore Boulevard (originally \\"Boulevard Drive\\"), connecting downtown with Toronto's growing western suburbs. The Coliseum, to host the new Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, was opened in 1921, followed by the Government of Ontario Building in 1926, the Princes' Gates in 1927, and the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1928. By the 1930s, the Beaux-Arts style faded in popularity. The start of the trend for a new style of architecture arguably became evident in the construction of the Automotive Building in 1929, the first building that moved away from the Beaux-Art architecture envisioned by the 1920 plan, mixing clean modern lines with classical ornamentation. In 1931, the Horse Palace was built, replacing temporary stables used for the Winter Fair. The Horse Palace used Art Deco ornamentation. In 1936, the Art Deco Bandshell was constructed for open-air music concerts. During the Second World War, the exhibition grounds became Toronto's main military training grounds. The CNE, and virtually all other non-military uses of the lands ceased. The CNE was not held between 1942 and 1946, when the land and its facilities were turned over to the Department of National Defence as a training ground. The Graphic Arts Building housed Red Cross facilities, the Coliseum became the RCAF Manning Depot, the Horse Palace was used for barracks and the Automotive Building became the shore facility HMCS York for the Royal Canadian Navy.Structures, episode CNE During World War 2, Rogers TV, 2001 After World War II, the buildings were used as a demobilization centre. The CNE would resume again in 1947, as the Canadian military returned the grounds back to its civilian administrators.  Post World War II  After the military vacated Stanley Barracks, the CNE made plans for the Barracks' demolition. However, until 1951, the buildings were used for emergency housing. The first phase of demolition in 1951 demolished all of the wooden buildings, leaving only the original stone buildings. In 1953, despite public opposition, three of the remaining four stone buildings were demolished for parking, leaving only the Officers' Quarters. In 1955, the Quarters found its first CNE use, for Sports Hall of Fame exhibits before being turned into a year-round Maritime Museum in 1959. A new phase of building construction followed, replacing buildings destroyed by fire, demolished for the Gardiner Expressway, or needed expansions. The new buildings, mostly in the central block of the site, exhibited a new Modernist style of architecture. In 1946, the third Grandstand burned down. In its place was built the fourth Grandstand, a massive concrete construction and monumental cantilevered steel roof was a sharp contrast to the other buildings around it. The Modernist trend continued with the construction of other buildings and monuments typifying the modernist style including the Food Building (1954), the Shell Oil Tower (1955), Queen Elizabeth Building (1957) and the Princess Margaret Fountain (1958). In the later 1950s, the new six- lane Gardiner Expressway was pushed through the north side of the grounds, cut below grade in the western section of the grounds, and an elevated section in the eastern section. This necessitated the demolition of the Dufferin Gate, the Women's Rest building and the Machinery Hall. The new parabolic arch Dufferin Gate was built in 1959. Remnant of Hall of Fame building facade at BMO Field. The building housed the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame from 1961 to 2006. On January 3, 1961, the Manufacturer's Building and the Women's Building (the one built prior to the Queen Elizabeth Building) were destroyed by fire. The buildings were replaced by the Better Living Centre, which came with a distinctive Mondrian-inspired ornament on its roof. In 1961, the Hall of Fame building opened north of the Grandstand to house Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1963, the Coliseum was re-clad with a modernist south facade. To replace its exhibit in the Ontario Government Building, the Government of Ontario built Ontario Place on artificial islands to the south of Exhibition Place (accessible via two foot bridges). Coinciding with the opening of the ultra-modern Ontario Place to the south, a new master plan for the Exhibition site was developed in 1971. The 1971 Master Plan was radical, calling for the demolition of many pre-World War II buildings, new Modernist buildings, and a massive central public space with a reflecting pool and fountains on the site of Exhibition Stadium, which was to be relocated. The plan proposed the demolition of the Fire Station, Art Gallery, General Exhibits Building, Railways Building, Government Building, Ontario Government Building, Automotive Building, Transportation Building, Band Shell, Grandstand, Shell Tower and the 1959 Dufferin Gate. A monorail was proposed to move people around the site and to and from the parking lots. It had first been proposed to connect Union Station and the Exhibition Grounds. Dufferin Street was to be connected to Lake Shore Boulevard, a new four-lane road along the north of the site and a new 1800-place parking lot taking the place of buildings to the west of Dufferin. Redeveloped Exhibition Stadium in 1977, during the second game played by the Toronto Blue Jays. The plan resulted in some demolition, such as the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1972 (allegedly in poor structural condition) and the General Exhibits Building and Art Gallery, which were in the path of the new road. In 1974, the International Building, (formerly the Transportation Building), to the west of the bandshell, burnt down. It was hosting an exhibit on Spain during the CNE when it caught fire and was destroyed. The building was demolished and not replaced, the site left vacant and has since used mostly as a parking lot. The 1971 plan was abandoned after Exhibition Stadium was redeveloped and enlarged to host Major League Baseball in 1977. The site officially became Exhibition Place, partly in recognition that very little of the site was retained as parklands. In 1978, to celebrate the centenary of the fair, a copy of the original 1913 music bandstand was built on the site of the original in the park north of the Horticulture Building. North of the park a new structure designed to resemble the 1870s-era exhibition buildings was added. The buildings host mostly children's activities during the CNE. The park was renamed Centennial Square and is also used for corporate picnics. Molson Indy at Exhibition Place. The annual IndyCar race was first organized at the site in 1986. In 1986, the streets were turned into a high-speed open-wheel car racing circuit for the first time. The race, known today as the Honda Indy Toronto, has taken place annually since, and is part of the IndyCar Series. The streets of Exhibition Place are closed off to regular traffic and a closed circuit is made through the grounds and along Lake Shore Boulevard. The race meant the end of the landmark Bulova/Shell Oil observation tower. In 1987, the Music Building, which had closed due to structural problems, was gutted by fire. The 1907 exterior was restored and a new interior was built. New emphasis on year-round use In the 1990s, budget pressures on the City of Toronto led to a new emphasis on the self-sufficiency of Exhibition Place. It saw the tear-down of the permanent midway buildings and the Flyer roller coaster. The City planned to charge rent to the midway's operator, Conklin Shows, which chose to tear down the buildings instead and set up temporary rides each year for the CNE. The Toronto Marlies of the AHL, moved into Coca- Cola Coliseum in 2003. The new National Trade Centre (now the Enercare Centre) trade show building, planned since the 1971 plan, was built on the vacant Electrical Building site to host more and larger trade shows year-round. It incorporated the Coliseum and Annex buildings to create one large exhibit space. In 2003, the Coliseum was rebuilt and expanded to provide a home for professional ice hockey. It is currently the home of the Toronto Marlies team from October to April each year. The trend to utilize the grounds year-round to cover the grounds' expense, continued with the rental of the Arts & Crafts Building to the Medieval Times theatre company, the Ontario Government Building was rented to become event space known as \\"Liberty Grand\\", and the Horticulture Building became a night club known as \\"Muzik.\\" The Automotive Building was turned over to private management and is used exclusively for private events and conferences. In 1999, Exhibition Stadium, mostly vacant after the opening of the downtown SkyDome stadium, was demolished. The site was vacant until 2007, when the new BMO Field soccer stadium, a public-private partnership, was built on the site to bring Major League Soccer to Toronto. The new soccer stadium also meant the end of the Hall of Fame building. The Hockey Hall of Fame had vacated earlier for downtown Toronto. A portion of the Hall of Fame facade was retained as one of the entrances to the new stadium. As a demonstration project, a WindShare wind turbine was built to the west of the Fort Rouill√© site. During the 2000s, the Exhibition Place grounds has seen several proposals for new uses. In July 2005, the City of Toronto asked for aquarium proposals from private enterprises. The only two respondents, Ripley Entertainment and Oceanus Holdings, suggested that they would be interested provided the location was closer downtown or had better transit access and parking. When the City of Toronto was considering the construction of a permanent casino, the CNE was the site of several proposals. The aquarium was built next to the CN tower and the City chose not to build a permanent casino. Two new buildings have been added at Exhibition Place. In the north-west corner, the Toronto Raptors basketball team built a new practice facility which is shared part-time with the community. In the south-east, along Lake Shore Boulevard, the \\"Hotel X\\" hotel was constructed on the site of New Fort York. The foundations of several of the New Fort York buildings were revealed as part of the development. The hotel was built to complement the facilities of the Enercare and Allstream Centres. The soccer stadium was recently expanded, and adapted to allow it to host the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts. 2015 Pan Am and Parapan Games The Chevrolet Beach Volleyball Centre at Exhibition Place. The centre, along with other facilities at Exhibition Place was used as event venues for the 2015 Pan Am Games. In July 2015, Exhibition Place was the site of sporting venues for the 2015 Pan American Games. The collection of sites was referred to as \\"CIBC Pan Am Park\\" and each building was given a venue name. The Enercare Centre and Coliseum buildings were used for indoor sports, temporary facilities for beach volleyball were built south of BMO Field and a watercourse laid out on Lake Ontario. As a result of the games, the 2015 Toronto Honda Indy was scheduled in June to allow for time for the site to prepare for the Pan Am Games. As well the site was wound down in time for setup for the 2015 Canadian National Exhibition (scheduled to open August 21). Buildings While the CNE only lasts for a few weeks at the end of the summer, many major permanent buildings and other structures have been built over the years. Most are used for other purposes throughout the year. Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters. Erected in 1840, the building is the last remaining structure of New Fort York, a military installation that predates Exhibition Place. The west end of the grounds is the original site of exhibitions and the oldest buildings are located here. There are five purpose-built fair buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock: the Horticulture Building, built in 1907; the Government Building, built in 1912; the Music Building, built in 1907; the Administration Building, built in 1905; and the Fire Hall/Police Station, built in 1912. Just south of Dufferin Gate is Centennial Square, a green space with a bandstand. The Ontario Government Building was added later in 1926. The Bandshell, modeled after the famed Art Deco Hollywood Bowl was built in 1936, replacing a 1906 bandstand. North of the Bandshell is Bandshell Park, a large open green space for gatherings. Near the Bandshell is the 1790s Scadding Cabin, the only building dating to the 1879 inaugural exhibition. There are two large fountains; the Princess Margaret Fountain and the Shrine Monument Fountain south of the Bandshell. To the west of Bandshell park, the former International Building site is now a parking lot, and there is a parking lot in the north-west corner of the site. The central block contains more recent 1950-1960s buildings, which are all replacements for earlier buildings, and are larger than the buildings to the west: the Better Living Centre (exhibition space), the Queen Elizabeth Building complex (theatre, exhibition and administration sections) and the Food Building. The BMO Field soccer stadium, built in 2007, is situated on the site of the 1947 Grandstand and the 1961 Halls of Fame building. South of BMO Field is a large open parking lot and midway area. The CNE plans to make the area a public square, and move the parking underground. South of the central section are two pedestrian bridges over Lake Shore Boulevard to the Ontario Place complex. The east block was the most active area of military usage and retains the only military building left on the site, the Stanley Barracks Officers' Quarters, dating to the 1840s. The area is a mix of buildings, including the older Coliseum, Horse Palace and newer buildings. The section is dominated by the exhibition complex of the Enercare Centre, Coliseum and the Industry Building. The Horse Palace (which adjoins the Coliseum and is used for equine shows and quartering), the Automotive Building (which was once used for car shows and is now a conference centre) and the General Services Building are all older exhibition buildings dating from the 1920s. The new \\"Hotel X\\" project includes a display of foundations of New Fort York which once occupied part of the site. Sports venues Exhibition Place was also home to Exhibition Stadium, which was built out of the fourth Grandstand by adding two extra wings of seats. The original grandstand had been constructed in the late 1800s and was re- modelled, replaced, or destroyed over the years. It served as home to the CFL's Toronto Argonauts between 1958 and 1988 and the Toronto Blue Jays (AL) between 1977 and 1989. The two teams left for SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in 1989. After it lost many stadium concert tours to Rogers Centre, and many other outdoor concerts to the nearby Molson Amphitheatre at Ontario Place, its usefulness was at an end. The stadium was demolished in 1999 to serve as parking and allow a more sprawling midway. However, on October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a 20,000 seat soccer stadium (BMO Field) on Exhibition Place land.  Exhibition Stadium (former stadium)  Exterior of Exhibition Stadium in 1992, several years before it was demolished. The CNE has been host to four grandstands since its inception. The third grandstand, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 and had a capacity of 16,000. It burned down in 1946, subsequently leading to the construction of the fourth (known as CNE Grandstand), built in 1948. Designed by architects Marani and Morris, this building was the first of what would prove to be several Modernist buildings built on the CNE grounds, its distinctive and bold cantilevered truss roof dominating the grounds for over 50 years. It initially housed 22,000 people, but was expanded over the years to a maximum of 54,000 in order to accommodate the additional seating required for major professional sports teams who made CNE Grandstand their home. It became the home base for the Toronto Argonauts football team, and later, to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. Architect Bill Sanford designed the alterations for baseball in 1976. A stock car race held on the grounds marked a historical race; on July 18, 1958, Richard Petty made his NASCAR Grand National Series debut at Exhibition Stadium. In addition to sports, CNE Grandstand was the stage for many entertainers over the years. Famous comedians who were featured there included Bob Hope, Victor Borge, and Bill Cosby. Similarly, many well-known musical acts made an appearance at the venue, ranging from Duke Ellington, Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, The Beach Boys (appearing there 11 times between 1974 and 1990), The Monkees, Sonny & Cher, to Melissa Etheridge, The Who, Simon & Garfunkel, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Billy Idol, Nine Inch Nails and Tina Turner. After the grandstand was demolished, open-air concerts during the CNE have been held at the Bandshell. The Blue Jays and Argos left the open-air Exhibition Stadium for the retractable roofed Skydome (now, the Rogers Centre) in 1989. By that time it was recognized that the building was beginning to visibly decay, and was little used in its final decade of existence. Though it was the earliest of the modernist-style buildings on the grounds, it was the only one not to be become a historically listed building. It was finally demolished in 1999.  BMO Field (current stadium)  BMO Field is an outdoor field located at Exhibition Place. In 2007, the open-air BMO Field soccer-specific stadium was constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame buildings. The Hall of Fame building had been vacated by the Hockey Hall of Fame and was demolished to make way for the stadium. The stadium was built to host Toronto FC, the Major League Soccer (MLS) team as well as the Canadian national soccer team. Capacity is approximately 31,000 people. It opened on April 28, 2007, the start of the 2007 MLS season. Under the FIFA-sanctioned name \\"National Soccer Stadium\\", it was the center-piece venue for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. It was expanded for the 2015 season and had a new roof installed for the 2016 season. In conjunction with the stadium construction, Princes' Boulevard was re-routed to the south of the stadium.  Coliseum  The Coliseum (1922, now part of the Enercare Centre complex) is an indoor arena. It is an example of Beaux-Arts design by City architect George F.W. Price and renovated by Brisbin Brook Beynon, Architects. Its main entrance was originally to the north, and the building was remodelled with a Modernist facade main entrance to the south in 1963. The original facade was restored when the Enercare Centre was built. It is home to the minor league Toronto Marlies professional ice hockey team during the winter months. Every November, it is used for the \\"Royal Horse Show\\" component of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair annually in November.  OVO Athletic Centre  The OVO Athletic Centre was completed in 2016. In another partnership with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the new OVO Athletic Centre (originally known as the Biosteel Centre) was completed in 2016 at the west end of Exhibition Place on parking lot lands. The facility is a practice facility for the Toronto Raptors National Basketball Association team. It has two basketball courts. The facility displaced some parkland, including a baseball diamond on the site used for a CNE tournament. Exhibit buildings  Better Living Centre  Modernist building opened in 1962. One of the Modernist buildings on the site, the original purpose of the Better Living Centre was to introduce new ranges of consumer goods to the baby boomer generation, making it a \\"space of encounter between consumer and product\\". For many people attending the CNE, the building hosted their first encounters with such technologies as colour television, transistor radios or home computers. It also became the place where people would expect to see the latest models of various consumer goods, ranging from vacuum cleaners to kitchen appliances. The building's stark modernist architecture, made up of large white forms, a vast flat roof and harsh angles, suited its futurist themes. The building was designed by architects Marani, Morris and Allan and was opened by Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips on August 17, 1962. It was built on the former site of the Manufacturers' building, which burned down in 1961. The new building replaced the exhibit space of the Manufacturers' Building and the General Exhibit Building. The CNE no longer uses the Better Living Centre for its original purpose of introducing consumers to the latest and greatest products during the CNE. Instead, it has been divided in two. One-half hosts the CNE Casino for the month of August, while the other half is the \\"Farm, Food and Fun\\" pavilion during the CNE. The building is used at other times of the year for special events. It hosts an indoor amusement park during March Break and a Hallowe'en exhibit \\"Screamers\\" during the month of October. Enercare Centre The Enercare Centre exhibition complex. The Enercare Centre (1997), along Princes' Boulevard, has seven exhibit halls with one million square feet (90,000 m¬≤) of space. The new building, first known as the National Trade Centre, took over the location of the old TTC streetcar loop and CNE entrance and the open space vacant since the Electrical and Engineering Building was demolished. It is interconnected with the Ricoh Coliseum and the Industry Building to the north to provide one large, configurable exhibition space. Home to the Toronto International Boat Show, the National Home Show, the One of A Kind Show, and the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Designed by architectural teams Zeidler Partnership Architects and Dunlop-Farrow Architects. During the exhibition, the building houses the international product displays and animal shows. Food Building The Food Building (1954) was built to replace the original Pure Food Building (c. 1922 and demolished 1953). It was designed by Richard A. Fisher. Water cascades down the windows of the east and west entrances to the building. At the main entrance and west entrance, bronze fish sculptures were created by Toronto artist Jean Horne (1914-2007) in the reflecting pool and an tall stainless steel pylon stands to the right of the main entrance. The building is used during the CNE for booths run by various restaurants and food companies.  Queen Elizabeth Building  The Queen Elizabeth Building was erected in 1956, and dedicated to Elizabeth II, who became the Queen of Canada in the same year. The Queen Elizabeth Building complex (1956) was originally named the Women's Building, but was rededicated to the new Queen of Canada. The building is composed of three sections: the two-storey administration building, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, and a one-storey exhibition hall. The structure is clad in brick and the roof is of a unique folded-plate cast- concrete design. It was designed by architect Peter Dickinson and architectural firm Page + Steele Inc. It was renamed in honour of a royal visit. The offices were once occupied by the CNE Association and Board. The theatre, which has 1300 seats, has been used for radio, variety, and fashion shows and hosts stage productions and concerts. The exhibition hall, which is a large uninterrupted exhibit space is used year-round and is home to arts, crafts, and hobbies displays during the CNE. The Scadding Cabin This one-room cabin is located adjacent to the Fort Rouill√© Monument and the CNE Bandshell. It is not only the oldest building on the grounds, but the oldest building in Toronto. It was built by the Queen's York Rangers in 1794 on behalf of John Scadding, who served as clerk (essentially, an executive assistant) to the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. The original cabin was disassembled from its original site and rebuilt by the York Pioneers, along with an adjacent cabin made out of new logs, on the current site, just in time for the original Toronto Industrial Exhibition in 1879. Scadding Cabin is Toronto's oldest standing structure. Erected in 1794, it was moved to its present site in 1879. Scadding was given a plot of land from what is now just north of Gerrard Street East, south to the waterfront. The cabin was built close to the Don River's east side, on what is now part of the Don Valley Parkway, just south of Queen Street East. Scadding sold the property in 1818 to William Smith. In 1879, his son William Smith offered the cabin to the York Pioneers, a local historical society. Around this time, someone mistook the information concerning the original owner for the cabin, leading to it being erroneously called \\"The Governor Simcoe cabin\\". John Scadding's youngest son, Henry Scadding wrote an early history of York/Toronto and set the record straight on who the original owner of the cabin was. When he died in 1901, the York Pioneers renamed it \\"The Scadding Cabin\\", in honour of this son of the original owner, who had also been a past president of their society. It is a squat, two-storey log cabin with low ceilings, designed to retain the heat from the fire in winter close to its occupants. It is said that John Graves Simcoe, who was over tall, had to stoop in order to enter the building. The building as it now stands is little changed from its original construction. Apparently an additional extension that would have appeared to the south of the building was not moved. The second cabin constructed next to it by the York Pioneers was built using wood that was too green, and it was demolished a few years after construction. Over the years some of the timbers have been replaced, and the cabin was remounted on a stone foundation in the late part of the 20th century. Inside the cabin are furnishings appropriate to a house in Upper Canada in the 1830s, and some known to have belonged to Simcoe. Music and entertainment venues  Bandshell  The CNE Bandshell with a modern canopy extension in 2007. The Art-Deco bandshell was erected in 1936. Inspired by the Hollywood Bowl, the Art Deco-styled Bandshell on the CNE grounds was built in 1936 according to designs prepared by the Toronto architectural firm of Craig and Madill.Heritage Toronto, CNE Bandshell It is situated on the west side of the grounds, and over the years has been host to many famous acts, including Guy Lombardo, Louis Armstrong, The Guess Who, and Joni Mitchell. More recently the likes of Susan Aglukark, Moxy Fr√ºvous, and Bob Newhart have played the open air venue. The adjacent park is known as Bandshell Park. In the north-east corner is the Exhibition Place Carillon. At the north-side of the park is the \\"Garden of the Greek Gods\\" collection of sculptures. Queen Elizabeth Theatre The Queen Elizabeth Theatre, opened in 1956, is a 1,250-seat auditorium, and is a part of the Queen Elizabeth building complex. It is leased to the operator of the Mod Club in Toronto and it is used for concerts and shows throughout the year. Gates and monuments  Dufferin Gates  Dufferin Gates serves as the western pedestrian entrance to Exhibition Place. The Dufferin Gates are the westernmost pedestrian entranceway to the CNE grounds. Named after Lord Dufferin, the original gate to the CNE grounds was named in his honour, situated at the bottom of Dufferin Street, also named after the same person. The original gateway was erected in 1895, and was superseded by a more permanent, ornate Beaux-Arts style triumphal arch built in 1910, and officially re-opened by Lord Dufferin in 1914. With the construction of Toronto's Gardiner Expressway in 1956, the gates were demolished in order to make way for the roadway. In their place a modernist- style parabolic arch was erected south of the previous gates in 1956, designed by architect Philip R. Brook. The current arch is built around a steel frame and concrete, with brick at the base. It is high and spans in width. It is similar in design to the much larger Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, but predates it. The star decoration that hangs from the top of the arch was added during Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967. The Gate is a listed heritage structure. A plaque from the Ontario Heritage Foundation commemorating the history of the CNE can be found just inside the gate.  Princes' Gates  Princes' Gates serves as Exhibition Place's eastern pedestrian entrance. The monumental Princes' Gates were officially opened by Princes Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), and Prince George (later the Duke of Kent), on August 31, 1927, during that year's CNE. The gates were built in the Beaux- Arts style to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Canadian Confederation and were originally to be called The Diamond Jubilee of Confederation Gates. The name was changed when it was found that the princes were touring Canada the year of its dedication.Ontario Heritage Trust Princes' Gates The first to pass through the gate was a parade of 15,000 veterans in the annual Warriors' Day Parade. =Fort Rouill√© Monument= A monument marks the spot where Fort Rouill√© once stood. A large obelisk, built in 1887, marks the spot where the original French-built Fort Rouill√© was erected in 1750 and 1751. Its construction was ordered by the Marquis de la Jonqui√®re, then governor of New France, in order to further establish a French presence in the area, and to intercept the trade of Indians travelling towards an English fur-trading post in present-day Oswego. It was a small palisaded fort with a bastion at each of its four corners, and containing five main buildings: a corps de garde, storeroom, barracks, blacksmithy, and a building for the officers. A drawing purported to date from 1749 shows the fort adjacent to Lake Ontario, whereas today it is situated on top of a small hill a hundred metres or so from the lake's current shoreline. The fort was abandoned and burned by the French garrison in July 1759, who were retreating from invading English forces. Vestiges of the fort remained for many years afterwards, but the site was graded over and sodded in preparation for the establishment of the nearby Scadding Cabin in 1879. The grounds were excavated in 1979 and 1980 by the Toronto Historical Board, and again in 1982 by the Youth Committee of the Toronto Sesquicentennial Board. The outline of the original fort has been marked out in concrete around the obelisk. Two commemorative plaques  one in English, and one in French  are attached to the base of the obelisk, placed there by the Ontario Heritage Foundation. To the north, a third plaque commemorates the excavation done on the site, and to the west, a fourth plaque commemorates a visit to the site by Bertrand Delano√´, mayor of Paris, on September 6, 2003. For many years, the obelisk was surrounded by two British cannon and a mortar, dating from the 1850s. They were removed to Fort York. =Shrine Peace Memorial= The Shrine Peace Memorial was erected in 1930 by the Shriners. This monument, depicting a winged angel holding aloft a crown of olive branches and standing upon a globe held aloft by female sphinxes, was presented to the people of Canada on June 12, 1930 by the Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (better known as the Shriners) as a symbol of peace and friendship between the United States and Canada. It is also meant as \\"an ongoing reminder that Freemasonry actively promotes the ideals peace, harmony, and prosperity for all humankind\\".Let There Be Peace It is situated immediately south of the Bandshell, and is the focal point of the surrounding rose garden. Other buildings and structures * The Automotive Building (1929), was designed by local architect Douglas Kertland in the Art Deco style. It is a two-storey building, in size. The internal plan is a large open space with a mezzanine on the second floor surrounding the main floor. It was originally constructed for the display of automobiles during the CNE. Management of the building was turned over to private management in 2009 and renovated to house the Allstream, now the Beanfield Centre meetings facility.

The Art Deco elements of the Horse Palace include a hard-edged angular composition, cubist forms and strong horizontal and vertical planes. The low relief sculptured friezes of horses located on the exterior of the building are also indicative of the Art Deco style of design. It is also the permanent home of the Toronto Police Service Mounted Unit, a branch of City of Toronto Animal Services and a riding academy. * The Horticulture Building, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 to replace the Crystal Palace. It is similar in style to the Government building (Beaux-Arts), but without the towers at the sides.

Additional telephone and press wire equipment was installed to handle the demand placed on it by the media. More recently the building has returned to its original function as home to the administrators of the CNE. This building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by architect G.W. Gouinlock, who went on to design several buildings on the grounds. A plaque dedicated to his work stands in front of the Press Building. It was once part of a formal plaza that originally boasted the Gooderham Fountain, also designed by Gouinlock, since replaced by the Princess Margaret Fountain in 1958. The Press Building, along with the nearby Fire Hall, Police Station, Railways (Music) Building, Horticulture, and Government buildings, are collectively designated Early Exhibition Buildings National Historic Site.

The start/finish line is located on Princes' Boulevard, slightly west of Newfoundland Drive. From the Start/Finish line, drivers head East towards the Princes' Gates, turning right (south) onto Canada Boulevard before reaching the gate. From Canada Boulevard, the track goes right onto Lake Shore Boulevard (west) which comprises the longest straightaway on the circuit (this straightaway is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Shoreline Drive during race telecasts; Shoreline Drive is the start-finish straight at the Grand Prix of Long Beach). Drivers re-enter the Exhibition grounds at Ontario Drive, heading north towards Prince's Boulevard where they turn left (west). The circuit continues on to Manitoba Drive and heads north-east then east until reaching Nova Scotia Avenue. At Nova Scotia Avenue, drivers turn right (south) then navigate a left-right-left series of turns until rejoining Prince's Boulevard and heading east towards the start/finish line. Exhibition Place is one of seven Canadian circuits to have held an Indy/Champ Car race, the others being Mosport, Concord Pacific Place in Vancouver, Edmonton City Centre Airport, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Circuit Mont-Tremblant, and Sanair Super Speedway. Transportation Public transit Exhibition Loop serves as a terminus for several streetcar routes. The grounds are well-connected to city and regional public transit systems. A commuter rail station (Exhibition GO Station) serves the grounds. Exhibition Place is also connected to city transit by the Toronto streetcar system's Harbourfront and Bathurst Street lines at the Exhibition Loop terminus, connecting Exhibition Place with Toronto subway system's Bathurst and Union stations. The grounds are also served by the Dufferin bus (routes 29 and 929), which loops through Exhibition Place most of the year and terminating at the Dufferin Gate Loop terminus during the CNE and the rest of the year. Routes 29 and 929 connects with the subway's Dufferin station on Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth. The first streetcar terminus began operations in 1916 and was located at the current loop location along Manitoba Drive, north of the Coliseum. In 1923, the loop was relocated to the south of the Coliseum. To accommodate the construction of the National Trade Centre, it was re-located back to the original location in 1996.

Mount Teide (, , \\"Teide Peak\\") is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain. Its summit (at ) is the highest point in Spain and the highest point above sea level in the islands of the Atlantic. If measured from the ocean floor, it is at 7,500 m (24,600 ft) the fourth- highest volcano in the world, and is described by UNESCO and NASA as Earth's third-tallest volcanic structure. Teide's elevation above sea level makes Tenerife the tenth highest island in the world. Teide is an active volcano: its most recent eruption occurred in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the northwestern Santiago rift. The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide a Decade Volcanohttp://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/DecadeVolcanoes/ Decade Volcanoes ‚Äì USGS because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are Garachico, Icod de los Vinos and Puerto de la Cruz. Teide, Pico Viejo and Monta√±a Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex of Tenerife. The volcano and its surroundings comprise Teide National Park, which has an area of and was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on June 28, 2007. Teide is the most visited natural wonder of Spain, the most visited national park in Spain and Europe and ‚Äì by 2015 ‚Äì the eighth most visited in the world, with some 3 million visitors yearly. In 2016, it was visited by 4,079,823 visitors and tourists, reaching a historical record. Teide Observatory, a major international astronomical observatory, is located on the slopes of the mountain.  Name and legends  Before the 1496 Spanish colonization of Tenerife, the native Guanches referred to a powerful figure living in the volcano, which carries light, power and the sun. El Pico del Teide is the modern Spanish name. Teide was a sacred mountain for the aboriginal Guanches, so it was considered a mythological mountain, as Mount Olympus was to the ancient Greeks. According to legend, Guayota (the devil) kidnapped Magec (the god of light and the sun) and imprisoned him inside the volcano, plunging the world into darkness. The Guanches asked their supreme god Acham√°n for clemency, so Acham√°n fought Guayota, freed Magec from the bowels of the mountain, and plugged the crater with Guayota. It is said that since then, Guayota has remained locked inside Teide. When going on to Teide during an eruption, it was customary for the Guanches to light bonfires to scare Guayota. Guayota is often represented as a black dog, accompanied by his host of demons (Tibicenas). The Guanches also believed that Teide held up the sky. Many hiding places found in the mountains contain the remains of stone tools and pottery. These have been interpreted as being ritual deposits to counter the influence of evil spirits, like those made by the Berbers of Kabylie. The Guanches believed the mountain to be the place that housed the forces of evil and the most evil figure, Guayota. Guayota shares features similar to other powerful deities inhabiting volcanoes, such as the goddess Pele of Hawaiian mythology, who lives in the volcano Kƒ´lauea and is regarded by the native Hawaiians as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.  Formation  Satellite image of Tenerife with different volcanic massifs labeled Summary diagram for formation of Tenerife through to current Teide volcano The stratovolcanoes Teide and Pico Viejo (Old Peak, although it is in fact younger than Teide) are the most recent centres of activity on the volcanic island of Tenerife, which is the largest () and highest () island in the Canaries. It has a complex volcanic history. The formation of the island and the development of the current Teide volcano took place in the five stages shown in the diagram on the right.  Stage one  Like the other Canary Islands, and volcanic ocean islands in general, Tenerife was built by accretion of three large shield volcanoes, which developed in a relatively short period.Guillou, H., Carracedo, J. C., Paris R. and P√©rez Torrado, F.J., 2004a.

This cessation of activity is typical of the Canaries; La Gomera, for example, is currently at this stage.Paris, R, Guillou, H., Carracedo, JC and Perez Torrado, F.J., Volcanic and morphological evolution of La Gomera (Canary Islands), based on new K-Ar ages and magnetic stratigraphy:implications for oceanic island evolution, Journal of the Geological Society, May 2005, v.162; no.3; p.501-512 After this period of quiescence, the volcanic activity became concentrated within two large edifices: the central volcano of Las Ca√±adas, and the Anaga massif. The Las Ca√±adas volcano developed over the Miocene shield volcanoes and may have reached in diameter and in height.Carracedo, J.C., P√©rez Torrado, F.J., Ancochea, E., Meco, J., Hern√°n, F., Cubas, C.R., Casillas, R., Rodr√≠guez Badiola, E. and Ahijado, A., 2002. In: Cenozoic Volcanism II: the Canary Islands. The Geology of Spain (W. Gibbons and T. Moreno, eds), pp. 439‚Äì472. Geological Society, London  Stage four  Around 160‚Äì220 thousand years ago the summit of the Las Ca√±adas I volcano collapsed, creating the Las Ca√±adas (Ucanca) caldera. Later, a new stratovolcano, Las Ca√±adas II, formed in the vicinity of Guajara and then catastrophically collapsed. Another volcano, Las Ca√±adas III, formed in the Diego Hernandez sector of the caldera. All of the Las Ca√±adas volcanoes attained a maximum altitude similar to that of Teide (which is sometimes referred to as the Las Ca√±adas IV volcano). Two theories on the formation of the caldera exist. The first states that the depression is the result of a vertical collapse of the volcano triggered by the emptying of shallow magma chambers at around sea level under the Las Ca√±adas volcano after large-volume explosive eruptions.Mart√≠, J., Mitjavila, J., Ara√±a, V., 1994.

Slope failures on the flanks of the western Canaested in the embayment itself.  Stage five  From around 160,000 years ago until the present day, the stratovolcanoes of Teide and Pico Viejo formed within the Las Ca√±adas caldera.ScienceDaily  Historical eruptions  Teide last erupted in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent, on the Santiago Ridge. Historical volcanic activity on the island is associated with vents on the Santiago or northwest rift (Boca Cangrejo in 1492, Monta√±as Negras in 1706, Narices del Teide or Chahorra in 1798, and El Chinyero in 1909) and the Cordillera Dorsal or northeast rift (Fasnia in 1704, Siete Fuentes and Arafo in 1705). The 1706 Monta√±as Negras eruption destroyed the town and principal port of Garachico, as well as several smaller villages. Historical activity associated with the Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide on the western flank of Pico Viejo. Eruptive material from Pico Viejo, Monta√±a Teide and Monta√±a Blanca partially fills the Las Ca√±adas caldera. The last explosive eruption involving the central volcanic centre was from Monta√±a Blanca around 2000 years ago. The last eruption within the Las Ca√±adas caldera occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide or Chahorra (Teide's Nostrils) on the western flank of Pico Viejo. The eruption was predominantly strombolian in style and most of the lava was  ªa ªƒÅ. This lava is visible beside the Vilaflor‚ÄìChio road. Christopher Columbus reported seeing \\"a great fire in the Orotava Valley\\" as he sailed past Tenerife on his voyage to discover the New World in 1492. This was interpreted as indicating that he had witnessed an eruption there. Radiometric dating of possible lavas indicates that in 1492 no eruption occurred in the Orotava Valley, but one did occur from the Boca Cangrejo vent. The last summit eruption from Teide occurred about the year 850 AD, and this eruption produced the \\"Lavas Negras\\" or \\"Black Lavas\\" that cover much of the flanks of the volcano. About 150,000 years ago, a much larger explosive eruption occurred, probably of Volcanic Explosivity Index 5. It created the Las Ca√±adas caldera, a large caldera at about 2,000 m above sea level, around from east to west and from north to south. At Guajara, on the south side of the structure, the internal walls rise as almost sheer cliffs from . The summit of Teide itself, and its sister stratovolcano Pico Viejo (), are both situated in the northern half of the caldera and are derived from eruptions later than this prehistoric explosion. Potential eruptions Future eruptions may include pyroclastic flows and surges similar to those that occurred at Mount Pel√©e, Merapi, Vesuvius, Etna, the Soufri√®re Hills, Mount Unzen and elsewhere. During 2003, there was an increase in seismic activity at the volcano and a rift opened on the north-east flank. No eruptive activity occurred but a quantity of material, possibly liquid, was emplaced into the edifice and is estimated to have a volume of ~1011 m3. Such activity can indicate that magma is rising into the edifice, but is not always a precursor to an eruption. Teide additionally is considered structurally unstable and its northern flank has a distinctive bulge. The summit of the volcano has a number of small active fumaroles emitting sulfur dioxide and other gases, including low levels of hydrogen sulfide. A scientific assessment in 2006, published in the journal Eos, observed that \\"in the past 30,000 years, eruptions have occurred at a rate of only four to six per millennium, with a predominance (70%) of very low hazard, basaltic eruptions\\". The authors further commented that \\"the recent eruptive record, combined with the available petrological and radiometric data, provides a rather optimistic outlook on major volcanic hazards related to Teide and its rift zones, posing only very localized threats to the one million inhabitants of Tenerife and the 4.5 million annual visitors to Teide National Park.\\" However, another study in 2009 concluded that Teide will probably erupt violently in the future, and that its structure is similar to that of Vesuvius and Etna.Un estudio prev√© que el Teide sufrir√≠a erupciones violentas (La Opini√≥n.es) Thus the magnitude of the risk posed by Teide to the public remains a source of debate.  Major climbs  In a publication of 1626, Sir Edmund Scory, who probably stayed on the island in the first decades of the 17th century, gives a description of Teide, in which he notes the suitable paths to the top and the effects its considerable height causes for travellers, indicating that the volcano had been accessed via different routes before the 17th century.Francisco Javier Castillo, The English Renaissance and the Canary Islands: Thomas Nichols and Edmund Scory, Proceedings of the II Conference of SEDERI: 1992: 57-69 In 1715 the English traveler J. Edens and his party made the ascent and reported their observations in the journal of the Royal Society in London. After the Enlightenment, most of the expeditions that went to East Africa and the Pacific had Teide as one of the most rewarding targets. The expedition of Lord George Macartney, George Staunton and John Barrow in 1792 almost ended in tragedy, as a major snowstorm and rain swept over them and they failed to reach the peak of Teide, just barely getting past Monta√±a Blanca. The German scientist Alexander von Humboldt stopped in Tenerife during his voyage to South America in 1799 and climbed Teide with his travelling companion Aim√© Bonpland and some local guides.Wulf, Andrea. The Invention of Nature: The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, the Lost Hero of Science. John Murray, 2016 During an expedition to Kilimanjaro, the German adventurer Hans Heinrich Joseph Meyer visited Teide in 1894 to observe ice conditions on the volcano. He described the two mountains as \\"two kings, one rising in the ocean and the other in the desert and steppes\\". More recently in November 2017, Gema Hassen-Bey became the first Paralympic athlete in the world in a wheelchair to reach 3,000 meters altitude with only the momentum of her arms. Initially, Gema wanted to reach the top of Teide, although, due to weather conditions, she could not meet this objective.  Flora and fauna  Echium wildpretii on Tenerife The lava flows on the flanks of Teide weather to a very thin but nutrient- and mineral-rich soil that supports a wide variety of plant species. Vascular flora consists of 168 plant species, 33 of which are endemic to Tenerife.Dupont, Yoko L., Dennis M., Olesen, Jens M., Structure of a plant-flower-visitor network in the high altitude sub-alpine desert of Tenerife, Canary Islands, Ecography. 26(3), 2003, pp. 301‚Äì310. Forests of Canary Island Pine (Pinus canariensis) with Canary Island juniper (Juniperus cedrus) occur from , covering the middle slopes of the volcano and reaching an alpine tree line lower than that of continental mountains at similar latitudes.Gieger, Thomas and Leuschner, Christoph.

Fernandez- Palacios, Climatic response of plant species on Tenerife, the Canary islands, J. Veg. Sci. 3, 1992, pp. 595‚Äì602 Within the Las Ca√±adas caldera and at higher altitudes, plant species endemic to the Teide National Park include: the Teide white broom (Spartocytisus supranubius), which has white flowers; Descurainia bourgaeana, a shrubby crucifer with yellow flowers; the Canary Island wallflower (Erysimum scoparium), which has violet flowers; and the Teide bugloss (Echium wildpretii), whose red flowers form a pyramid up to in height. The Teide daisy (Argyranthemum teneriffae) can be found at altitudes close to above sea level, and the Teide violet (Viola cheiranthifolia) can be found right up to the summit, making it the highest flowering plant in Spain.J.M. Fernandez-Palacios and J.P. de Nicolas, Altitudinal pattern of vegetation variation on Tenerife, J. Veg. Sci. 6, 1995, pp. 183‚Äì190 These plants are adapted to the tough environmental conditions on the volcano, such as high altitude, intense sunlight, extreme temperature variations, and lack of moisture. Adaptations include hemispherical forms, a downy or waxy cover, a reduction of the exposed leaf area, and high flower production.C. Leuschner, Timberline and alpine vegetation on the tropical and warm-temperate oceanic islands of the world: elevation, structure and floristics, Vegetatio 123, 1996, pp. 193‚Äì206. Flowering takes place in the late spring or early summer, in May and June. Southern Tenerife lizard (Gallotia galloti galloti) Teide National Park contains a large number of invertebrate species, over 40% of which are endemic species, and 70 of which are found only in the National Park. The invertebrate fauna includes spiders, beetles, dipterans, hemipterans, and hymenopterae.Ashmole, M. and Ashmole, P. (1989) Natural History Excursions in Tenerife. Kidston Mill Press, Scotland. . In contrast, Teide National Park has only a limited variety of vertebrate fauna.Thorpe, R.S., McGregor, D.P., Cumming, A.M., and Jordan, W.C., DNA evolution and colonisation sequence of island lizards in relation to geological history: mtDNA RFLP, cytochrome B, cytochrome oxidase, 12s rRNA sequence, and nuclear RAPD analysis, Evolution, 48(2), 1994, pp. 230‚Äì240 Ten species of bird nest there, including the blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea), Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii berthelotii), the Atlantic canary (Serinus canaria) and a subspecies of kestrel (Falco tinnunculus canariensis).Lack, D., and H.N.

Three endemic reptile species are found in the park: the Canary Island lizard (Gallotia galloti galloti), the Canary Island wall gecko (Tarentola delalandii), and the Canary Island skink (Chalcides viridanus viridanus). The only mammals native to the park are bats, the most common of which is Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri). Other mammals, such as the mouflon, the rabbit, the house mouse, the black rat, the feral cat, and the North African hedgehog, have all been introduced to the park.Nogales, M., Rodr√≠guez-Luengo, J.L. & Marrero, P. (2006) \\"Ecological effects and distribution of invasive non-native mammals on the Canary Islands\\" Mammal Review, 36, 49‚Äì65  The shadow of Teide  Shadow of Teide at dawn Teide casts the world's largest shadow projected on the sea.La sombra del TeideSuprenubius. La sombra del Teide. This phenomenon occurs during sunset, and also causes the shadow to partially cover the island of Gran Canaria at sunset or La Gomera at dawn, more than 40 km away from the mountain. One characteristic is that the shadow has a perfectly triangular shape, even though Teide's silhouette does not; this is an effect of perspective. Visitors and tourists climb to the top of the volcano at sunset to witness this phenomenon.  Scientific use  Teide National Park is a useful volcanic reference point for studies related to Mars because of the similarities in their environmental conditions and geological formations. In 2010 a research team tested the Raman instrument at Las Ca√±adas del Teide in anticipation of its use in the 2016‚Äì2018 ESA-NASA ExoMars expedition. In June 2011 a team of researchers from the UK visited the park to test a method for looking for life on Mars and to search for suitable places to test new robotic vehicles in 2012.Buscando \\"marcianos\\" en el Teide La Laguna, 10 August 2011. (Archived)  Access  The volcano and its surroundings, including the whole of the Las Ca√±adas caldera, are protected in the Teide National Park. Access is by a public road running from northeast to southwest across the caldera. TITSA runs a return service to Teide once a day from both Puerto de la Cruz and Playa de las Americas. The park has a parador (hotel) and a small chapel. A cable car goes from the roadside at most of the way to the summit, reaching , carrying up to 38 passengers (34 in a high wind) and taking eight minutes to reach the summit. Access to the summit itself is restricted; a free permit is required to climb the last . Numbers are normally restricted to 200 per day. Several footpaths take hikers to the upper cable car terminal, and then onto the summit. Mount Teide from a distance with a cloud at the top Because of the altitude, the air is significantly thinner than at sea level. This can cause people (especially with heart or lung conditions) to become light-headed or dizzy, to develop altitude sickness, and in extreme cases to lose consciousness. The only treatment is to return to lower altitudes and acclimatise.  Astronomical observatory  Teide Observatory An astronomical observatory is located on the slopes of the mountain, taking advantage of the good weather, and the altitude, which puts it above most clouds, and promotes stable Astronomical seeing. The Teide Observatory is operated by the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias. It includes solar, radio and microwave telescopes, in addition to traditional optical night-time telescopes.  Symbol  Teide is the main symbol of Tenerife and the most emblematic natural monument of the Canary Islands. An image of Teide, gushing flames, appears at the centre of Tenerife's coat of arms. Above the volcano appears St. Michael, the patron saint of Tenerife. The flag colors of the island are dark blue, traditionally identified with the sea that surrounds the island, and white for the whiteness of the snow-covered peaks of Mount Teide during winter. The logo of the Cabildo de Tenerife (governing body of the island) includes a symbol of Teide in eruption. Teide has been depicted frequently throughout history, from the earliest engravings made by European conquerors to typical Canarian craft objects, on the back of 1000-peseta notes, in oil paintings and on postcards. In the Canary Islands, especially on Tenerife, Teide has cultural symbolism deeply rooted in traditions and history. It is popularly referred to as Padre Teide (Father Teide).

Verwer has written several books on various Christian themes. He is a passionate advocate of radical discipleship as the only legitimate option for people who believe in Jesus. In recent days, he has been working in India (Barathdasham in Telugu) ministered in various languages including Hindi, Telugu and Tamil. Over a million books he has authored have been distributed worldwide. Early life Verwer's first contact with Christianity was through his neighbor, Dorothea Clapp, who gave him the Gospel of John and also put him on her \\"Holy Ghost hit list\\". Verwer attributes to her some of the reasons that he made a commitment to Christ, and for what resulted in his life. In 1953, as a 14-year-old student from Wyckoff, New Jersey attending Ramsey High School, Verwer went to a Jack Wyrtzen meeting in which Billy Graham spoke in Madison Square Garden, in New York City. There he was converted to become a Christian, at the age of 16. Within a year, about 200 of his classmates became Christians.Wood, Patrick. \\"George Verwer and the birth of OM\\", Operation Mobilisation, October 30, 2016. Accessed October 19, 2017. \\"In Wyckoff, New Jersey, in 1953 George was 14 years old, high-spirited, and showing promise as a natural-born leader at Ramsey High School when Mrs. Clapp‚Äôs son first gave him a copy of John‚Äôs Gospel.\\" He had a growing conviction to evangelize on foreign soil. He started with the distribution of the Gospel of John in Mexico in 1957 along with two friends, Walter Borchard and Dale Rhoton. They called this operation \\"Send the Light\\". This continued with others during the summer holidays. Afterward, Verwer used the name \\"Send the Light\\" for a book distribution operation to India based in the United Kingdom. This developed into Send the Light, which was once the largest Christian book distributor in the United Kingdom, but entered into Administration December 2009 and moved into Liquidation December 2010. Education After high school, he attended Maryville College and then transferred to Moody Bible Institute, where he met his wife, Drena, a fellow student. They have three children. He was awarded an honorary degree, Doctor of Divinity, during commencement at Biola University on May 22, 2009. Operation Mobilization After graduation, they went to Spain. Once while taking Bibles into the USSR, George was arrested and accused of being a spy. He was deported, and back in Spain, after a time of prayer in 1961 the work of Operation Mobilization (OM) was born. George often refers to this calling himself \\"God's Bungler\\", in reference to Brother Andrew, \\"God's Smuggler\\". In August 2003, George handed over the international leadership of the work of Operation Mobilisation to Peter Maiden, who was the Associate International Director for 15 years. George and his wife are now involved in Special Projects Ministries full-time, traveling and taking meetings around the world. Bibliography Books * The Fruit of the Spirit, Bangalore: O.M.

Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. The much smaller belt manlift which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments is also sometimes called a paternoster. The name paternoster (\\"Our Father\\", the first two words of the Lord's Prayer in Latin) was originally applied to the device because the elevator is in the form of a loop and is thus similar to rosary beads used as an aid in reciting prayers. The construction of new paternosters was stopped in the mid-1970s out of concern for safety, but public sentiment has kept many of the remaining examples open. By far most remaining paternosters are in Europe, with 230 examples in Germany, and 68 in the Czech Republic. Only three have been identified outside Europe: one in Malaysia, one in Sri Lanka, and another in Peru.  History  Peter Ellis installed the first elevators that could be described as paternoster lifts in Oriel Chambers in Liverpool in 1868. Another was used in 1876 to transport parcels at the General Post Office in London. In 1877, British engineer Peter Hart obtained a patent on the first paternoster. In 1884, the engineering firm of J & E Hall of Dartford, Kent, installed its first \\"Cyclic Elevator\\", using Hart's patent, in a London office block. The newly built Dovenhof in Hamburg was inaugurated in 1886. The prototype of the Hamburg office buildings equipped with the latest technology also had a paternoster. This first system outside of Great Britain already had the technology that would later become common, but was still driven by steam power like the English systems. The highest paternoster lift in the world was located in Stuttgart in the 16-floor Tagblatt tower, which was completed in 1927. Paternosters were popular throughout the first half of the 20th century because they could carry more passengers than ordinary elevators. They were more common in continental Europe, especially in public buildings, than in the United Kingdom. They are relatively slow elevators, typically travelling at about 30 cm per second (approx. 1 ft per second), to facilitate getting on and off. Safety Paternoster elevators are only intended for transporting people; accidents have occurred when paternosters were misused for transporting bulky items such as ladders or library trolleys. The risk involved is estimated to be thirty times higher than conventional elevators; a representative of the Union of Technical Inspection Associations stated that Germany saw an average of one death per year prior to 2002, at which point many paternosters were made inaccessible to the general public. The construction of new paternosters is no longer allowed in many countries because of the high risk of accident for people who cannot use the lift properly. In 2012, an 81-year-old man was killed when he fell into the shaft of a paternoster in the Dutch city of The Hague. Elderly people, disabled people, and children are the most in danger of being crushed or losing a limb. In September 1975, the paternoster in Newcastle University's Claremont Tower was taken out of service after a passenger was killed when a car left its guide rail at the top of its journey and forced the two cars ascending behind it into the winding room above. In October 1988, a second non-fatal accident occurred in the same lift. A conventional lift was installed in its place in 1989‚Äì1990. In West Germany, new paternoster installations were banned in 1974, and there was an attempt to shut down all existing installations in 1994. However, there was a wave of popular resistance to the ban at that time, and to another prospective ban in 2015. , Germany has 231 paternosters. In April 2006, Hitachi announced plans for a modern paternoster-style elevator with computer-controlled cars and standard elevator doors to alleviate safety concerns. A prototype was revealed . In 2009, Solon received special permission to build a brand new paternoster in its Berlin headquarters. Surviving examples Many paternoster lifts have been shut down, but there are surviving examples still in use: Austria * In Vienna, the Rathaus (city hall) and the Ringturm (headquarters of the Vienna Insurance Group) have the last two running and frequently used paternosters in the city. The university also had one or more. * In Klagenfurt, the Headquarters of the energy company Kelag still have one paternoster active for daily use. Belgium * A paternoster lift dating from 1958 survives in Avenue Fonsny 47, Brussels, a currently disused office building forming part of Midi/Zuid railway station.http://www.irismonument.be/fr.Saint- Gilles.Avenue_Fonsny.47.html * At the Huis van de Vlaamse Volksvertegenwoordigers (House of Flemish Representatives), previously the Postcheque Building, at Leuvenseweg/Rue de Louvain 86, the paternoster is operational but not used.

In traditional inventory management, a retailer (sometimes called buyer) makes his or her own decisions regarding the order size, while in VMI the retailer shares their inventory data with a vendor (sometimes called supplier) such that the vendor is the decision-maker who determines the order size for both. Thus, the vendor is responsible for the retailer's ordering cost, while the retailer has to pay for their own holding cost. This policy can prevent stocking undesired inventories and hence can lead to an overall cost reduction. Moreover, the bullwhip effect is also reduced by employing the VMI approach in a buyer‚Äìsupplier cooperation. As replenishment frequencies play an important role in integrated inventory models to reduce the total cost of supply chains which many studies fail to model it in mathematical problems. A third-party logistics provider can also be involved to make sure that the buyer has the required level of inventory by adjusting the demand and supply gaps.\\"What Is Vendor Managed Inventory?\\", Datalliance, Retrieved Aug. 16, 2016 As a symbiotic relationship, VMI makes it less likely that a business will unintentionally become out of stock of a good and reduces inventory in the supply chain. Furthermore, vendor (supplier) representatives in a store benefit the vendor by ensuring the product is properly displayed and store staff are familiar with the features of the product line, all these while helping to clean and organize their product lines for the store. VMI can also decrease the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. One of the keys to making VMI work is shared risk. In some cases, if the inventory does not sell, the vendor (supplier) will repurchase the product from the buyer (retailer). In other cases, the product may be in the possession of the retailer but is not owned by the retailer until the sale takes place, meaning that the retailer simply houses (and assists with the sale of) the product in exchange for a predetermined commission or profit (sometimes referred to as consignment stock). A special form of this commission business is scan-based trading, where VMI is usually applied but its use is not mandatory.\\"Vendor Managed Inventory: Three Steps in Making it Work\\", NC State University Supply Chain Resource Cooperative, Retrieved Aug. 16, 2016 This is one of the successful business models used by Walmart and many other big box retailers.Sila √áetinkaya & Chung-Yee Lee, \\"Stock Replenishment and Shipment Scheduling for Vendor-Managed Inventory Systems \\", Management Science, Volume 46 Issue 2, February 2000, pp. 217-232. Accessed 9 June 2014 Oil companies often use technology to manage the gasoline inventories at the service stations that they supply (see Petrolsoft Corporation). Home Depot uses the technique with larger suppliers of manufactured goods. VMI helps foster a closer understanding between the supplier and manufacturer by using electronic data interchange formats, EDI software and statistical methodologies to forecast and maintain correct inventory in the supply chain. Vendors benefit from more control of displays and more customer contact for their employees; retailers benefit from reduced risk, better store staff knowledge (which builds brand loyalty for both the vendor and the retailer), and reduced display maintenance outlays. Consumers benefit from knowledgeable store staff who are in frequent and familiar contact with manufacturer (vendor) representatives when parts or service are required. Store staff have good knowledge of most product lines offered by the entire range of vendors. They can help the consumer choose from competing products for items most suited to them and offer service support being offered by the store. At the goods' manufacturing level, VMI helps prevent overflowing warehouses or shortages, as well as costly labor, purchasing and accounting. With VMI, businesses maintain a proper inventory, and optimized inventory leads to easy access and fast processing with reduced labor costs.\\"Insider's Tips to Packaging Issues\\", CGR Products, Retrieved Aug. 16, 2016 Classes 1- Bi-Level VMI Mathematical Models The first class of VMI, bi-level VMI mathematical model, includes two levels (or echelons) in a supply chain: vendor and retailer. There are three types of VMI mathematical models developed from this class, which are single-vendor single-retailer VMI model, single-vendor multi-retailer VMI model, and multi-vendor multi-retailer VMI model. This class has been significantly developing. For example, single- vendor single-retailer VMI model was extended for multi-product case, the consignment stock (CS), and discount. 2- Multi-Level VMI Mathematical Models The second class is multi-level VMI mathematical model such as a single manufacturer-single vendor multi-retailer (SM-SV-MR) VMI model. Those studies fail to model replenishment frequencies cannot classified here. As replenishment frequencies play an important role in integrated inventory models to reduce the total cost of supply chains which many studies fail to model it in mathematical problems.  Components of VMI  1\\\\. Inventory location In VMI practice, inventory location depends on the arrangement between the vendor and the customer. The first option is for the inventory to be located both at the customer's and the supplier's premises. For the supplier, this serves as a safeguard against short delivery cycles or unsynchronized production cycles. On the other hand, this arrangement can also infer higher inventory holding costs because of the need for storage of the material, it's tracking and handling, and the threat of inventory obsolescence. Another option can be for the vendor to deliver to the customer's central warehouse or alternatively, to a third party's warehouse. The latter can be a solution for buyers that have outsourced part or all of their logistics operations. Managing the inventory at the central warehouse enables better optimization of deliveries, lower costs and ultimately enables the buyer to maximize economies of scale. However, it is not always an option, so third-party warehouses are often the solution to many different problems such as the supplier's warehouse being too far away from the buyer's or the buyer's inexperience in storing particular types of goods that are harder to store. The inventory can also be located directly at the buyer's premises such as the buyer's on-site warehouse, production line or the shop floor itself. However, replenishing inventory levels at these specific locations can be more costly, less organized and overall more difficult to manage for the supplier. 2\\\\. Inventory Ownership Inventory ownership refers to the ownership of the inventory and when the invoice is being issued to the retailer. In vendor managed inventory, there is a number of solutions in terms of payment and transfer of ownership. In the first alternative, vendor is the owner of inventory at the premises of customer. Invoice is issued when the items are issued from the stock. In the second alternative, retailer assumes ownership of the inventory, but receives an invoice upon delivery. However, the vendor is not paid until the customer issues the items from stock and within a delay according to agreed terms of payment. This enables risk-sharing between both of the parties, as retailer carries risk of obsolescence while vendor would have been accountable for capital costs and fluctuation in prices of the inventory. In the third alternative, also referred to as a standard process in traditional order delivery, retailer owns the inventory upon delivery, while the vendor invoices the retailer once the shipment has been made. In this setting, retailer is responsible for inventory investment and holding costs, but has an option of protecting themselves against price fluctuations. 3\\\\. Level of Demand Visibility These elements refer to the type of demand information shared by customers to assist the suppliers in controlling their inventory. Many types of demand information are shared in VMI Program. The demand information that are visible to the supplier are: sales data, stock withdrawal, production schedule, inventory level, goods in transit, back order, incoming order and return. It is argued that sharing data and inventory can improve the supplier‚Äôs production planning, make it more stable and increase its visibility. It also provides a better understanding of the seasonal changes, and helps figuring out critical times. The supplier can therefore take advantage of this information and adapt its production to the customers‚Äô requests, and respond faster. With the increasing visibility of information, the supplier has longer timeframe for replenishment arrangement Elvander, Mikael; Sarpola, Sami; Mattsson, Stig-Arne (November 2007). \\"Framework for characterizing the design of VMI systems\\". 37 (10): 782‚Äì798. doi:10.1108/09600030710848914. The supplier also gets real time visibility, which allows him to have a hand on the inventory for the buyer demand forecast, which allows for projecting inventory based on future demand to target his inventory (minimize or maximize it). https://www.scmr.com/wp_content/e2open_wp_building_effective_vmi_020216.pdf.

Sherman later ordered the army to lend mules for the agrarian reform effort. The field orders followed a series of conversations between Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Radical Republican abolitionists Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens following disruptions to the institution of slavery provoked by the American Civil War. Many freed people believed, after being told by various political figures, that they had a right to own the land they had been forced to work as slaves, and were eager to control their own property. Freed people widely expected to legally claim 40 acres of land (a quarter-quarter section) and a mule after the end of the war. Some freedmen took advantage of the order and took initiatives to acquire land plots along a strip of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida coasts. However, Abraham Lincoln's successor as president, Andrew Johnson, explicitly reversed and annulled proclamations such as Special Field Orders No. 15 and the Freedmen's Bureau bills. Some land redistribution occurred under military jurisdiction during the war and for a brief period thereafter. However, federal and state policy during the Reconstruction era emphasized wage labor, not land ownership, for black people. Almost all land allocated during the war was restored to its pre-war white owners. Several black communities did maintain control of their land, and some families obtained new land by homesteading. Black land ownership increased markedly in Mississippi during the 19th century, particularly. The state had much undeveloped bottomland behind riverfront areas that had been cultivated before the war. Most blacks acquired land through private transactions, with ownership peaking at in 1910, before an extended financial recession caused problems that resulted in the loss of property for many. A 2020 study contrasted the successful distribution of free land to former slaves in the Cherokee Nation with the failure to give former slaves in the Confederacy free land. The study found that even though levels of inequality in 1860 were similar in the Cherokee Nation and the Confederacy, former black slaves prospered in the Cherokee Nation over the next decades. The Cherokee Nation had lower levels of racial inequality, higher incomes for blacks, higher literacy rates among blacks, and greater school attendance rates among blacks. Background The institution of slavery in the United States deprived multiple generations of the opportunity to own land. Legally slaves could not own anything, but in practice they did acquire capital, although they were considered the lowest-ranking members of the capitalist system.Mitchell, From Reconstruction to Deconstruction (2001), pp. 523‚Äì524. As legal slavery came to an end, many freed people fully expected to gain ownership of the land they had worked, as some abolitionists had led them to expect. African Americans faced severe discrimination, in the North even more than the South, and were maintained as a distinct \\"racial\\" group by laws requiring racial segregation and prohibiting so-called \\"miscegenation\\".Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), p. xv. Perceived as a job-stealing threat to society‚Äîthey were a downward force on wages since they usually would work for less than whites‚Äîand even more as a dangerous influence on those who remained enslaved, free Negroes were unwelcome in most areas of the United States.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xvi‚Äìxviii. Before the Civil War, most free blacks lived in the North, which had abolished slavery. In some places they acquired substantial real estate.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xx, xxxviii‚Äìxl. In the South, vagrancy laws had allowed the states to force free Negroes into labor, and sometimes to sell them into slavery.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xxiiv‚Äìxxiv. Nevertheless, free Africans across the country performed a variety of occupations, and a small number owned and operated successful farms.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xxxvi, xlii‚Äìxliii. Others settled in Upper Canada (now Southern Ontario), an endpoint of the Underground Railroad, and in Nova Scotia.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xli‚Äìxlii. Whites did not agree on how freed people ought to be treated. Some maintained that the land the freedmen had farmed for no pay should be taken from their former owners and given to them. Others wanted them sent \\"somewhere else\\"; they opposed the \\"race\\"-mixing that allowing them to remain In the U.S. would bring about. Plans for a \\"colony\\" of freedmen began in 1801, when James Monroe asked President Thomas Jefferson to help create a penal colony for rebellious blacks.Dyer, \\"The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization\\" (1943), p. 54.Lacy K. Ford, Deliver Us from Evil: The Slavery Question in the Old South; Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 62. The American Colonization Society formed in 1816 to address the issue of free African Americans through settlement (not resettlement) abroad.Woodson, Brief Treatment of the Free Negro (1925), pp. xl‚Äìxli. Although there was discussion of settling freedmen in some undeveloped land in the new western territories, or helping them emigrate to Canada or Mexico, the ACS decided to send them to Africa, to the closest available land (and therefore the cheapest to reach). By 1860, the ACS had settled thousands of African Americans in Liberia. But colonization was slow and expensive, and of little interest to most African Americans, who said they were no more African than white Americans were British. Mortality from tropical diseases was ghastly, and while the enslaved population was in the millions, settlers to Liberia were in the low thousands. who had no ties with or interest in Africa, and as mass emancipation loomed there was no consensus about what to do with the millions of soon-to-be-free black slaves. This issue had long been known to white authorities as \\"The Negro Problem\\".Dyer, \\"The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization\\" (1943), p. 53. The idea of a land grant to an entire class of people was not as unusual in the 1700s and 1800s as it seems today. There was so much land that it was often given free to anyone that would farm it. For example, Thomas Jefferson proposed a grant of 50 acres to any free man who didn't already have at least that much, in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776.Draft Constitution of Virginia, 1776 http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffcons.asp More recently, various Homestead Acts were passed 1862‚Äì1916, granting 160‚Äì640 acres (a quarter section to a full section), depending on the act, and earlier homesteading occurred under statutes such as the Preemption Act of 1841. Freedmen were not generally eligible for homesteading because they were not citizens, which changed with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, when they were granted citizenship, and the Fifteenth Amendment, which in 1870 gave them the right to vote. War As the Northern Army began to seize property in its war with the South, Congress passed the Confiscation Act of 1861. This law allowed the military to seize rebel property, including land and slaves. In fact, it reflected the rapidly growing reality of black refugee camps that sprang up around the Union Army. These glaring manifestations of the \\"Negro Problem\\" provoked hostility from much of the Union rank-and-file‚Äîand necessitated administration by officers.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), p. 26. \\"The North, unprepared for war, was even more unprepared for the burden of caring for thousands of fleeing bondsmen. The only organization which could perform this monumental task was the Union army. But to most army men, freedmen were at best a nuisance. At worst, they were representatives of the despised race for whom Northern white men were being asked to kill or be killed.\\" Grand Contraband Camp After secession, the Union maintained its control over Fort Monroe in Hampton on the coast of Southern Virginia. Escaped slaves rushed to the area, hoping for protection from the Confederate Army. (Even more quickly, the town's white residents fled to Richmond.)Bonekemper, Negro Ownership of Real Property (1970), p. 169. General Benjamin Butler set a precedent for Union forces on May 24, 1861, when he refused to surrender escaped slaves to Confederates claiming ownership. Butler declared the slaves contraband of war and allowed them to remain with the Union Army.Jackson, The Origin of Hampton Institute (1925), p. 133. \\"Nevertheless, shady though some of his tactics may have been in the opinion of some, Butler is to be rated as famous for the stand he took on that morning of the twenty-fourth of May when he declared that the escaped slave who stood before him should not be returned to his master but that he and all others who so came were to be regarded as contraband of war.2 From this time forward all escaped and abandoned slaves in the South were frequently known as 'contrabands.'\\" By July 1861, there were 300 \\"contraband\\" slaves working for rations at Fort Monroe. By the end of July there were 900, and General Butler appointed Edward L. Pierce as Commissioner of Negro Affairs.Bonekemper, Negro Ownership of Real Property (1970), p. 170. Confederate raiders under General John B. Magruder burnt the nearby town of Hampton, Virginia on August 7, 1861, but the \\"contraband\\" blacks occupied its ruins. They established a shantytown known as the Grand Contraband Camp. Many worked for the Army at a rate of $10.00/month, but these wages were not sufficient for them to make major improvements in housing. Conditions in The Camp grew worse, and Northern humanitarian groups sought to intervene on behalf of its 64,000 residents.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), p. 171. \\"Nevertheless, the housing situation was so desperate that complaints emanated from the Reverend Lockwood, the A.M.A. and the just- organized National Freedmen's Relief Association and led to investigation by the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, appointment of Captain C. B. Wilder of Boston to protect the blacks' interests and the construction of large buildings in which the Negroes could live.\\"Jackson, The Origin of Hampton Institute (1925), p. 135. Captain C. B. Wilder was appointed to organize a response. The perceived humanitarian crisis may have hastened Lincoln's plans for colonizing √éle-√†-Vache.Boyd, \\"The √éle a Vache Colonization Venture\\" (1959), p. 49. \\"The distress of the six thousand Negroes at Fort Monroe, Virginia, may have influenced Lincoln to proceed despite the Senator's misgivings. A report by Quakers in December, 1862, described the refugees quartered in small rooms, sometimes containing ten to twelve persons each, with insufficient fuel and clothing to keep warm throughout the winter month.\\" A plan developed in September 1862 would have relocated refugees en masse to Massachusetts and other northern states.Voegeli, \\"A Rejected Alternative\\" (2003), p. 767. This plan‚Äîinitiated by John A. Dix and supported by Captain Wilder and Secretary of War Stanton‚Äîdrew negative reactions from Republicans who wanted to avoid connecting northward black migration with the newly announced Emancipation Proclamation.Voegeli, \\"A Rejected Alternative\\" (2003), p. 769. Fear of competition by black workers, as well as generalized racial prejudice, made the prospect of black refugees unpalatable for Massachusetts politicians.Voegeli, \\"A Rejected Alternative\\" (2003), pp. 776‚Äì777. With support from orders from General Rufus Saxton, General Butler and Captain Wilder pursued local resettlement operations, providing many of the blacks in Hampton with two acres of land and tools with which to work.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), pp. 171‚Äì172. Others were assigned jobs as servants in the North.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 38‚Äì39. Various smaller camps and colonies were formed, including the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island. Hampton was well known as one of the War's first and biggest refugee camps, and served as a sort of model for other settlements.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 3‚Äì4, 25. \\"During the Civil War, the groups which would shape the post-bellum life of black Hampton came together for the first time. Over that same period, the issues that would inform black and white approaches to freedom, in Hampton and in the South as a whole, crystalized. [...] In these unstable circumstances, Northern whites and Southern blacks had their first large-scale encounter of the war.\\" Sea Islands The Union Army occupied the Sea Islands after the November 1861 Battle of Port Royal, leaving the area's many cotton plantations to the black farmers who worked on them. The early liberation of the Sea Island blacks, and the relatively unusual absence of the former white masters, raised the issue of how the South might be organized after the fall of slavery. Lincoln, commented State Department official Adam Gurowski, \\"is frightened with the success in South Carolina, as in his opinion this success will complicate the question of slavery.\\"Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 18‚Äì19.Adam Gurowski, Diary: from March 4, 1861, to November 12, 1862.; Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1862, p. 121. In the early days of federal occupation, troops were badly mistreating the island's residents, and had raided plantation supplies of food and clothing. One Union officer was caught preparing to secretly transport a group of blacks to Cuba, in order to sell them as slaves.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 20. \\"The rapid change in their status was not working to the advantage of many Sea Island Negroes, and their obvious hardship since the Federal invasion was embarrassing to the government. The army had made free use of plantation food stores, leaving many slave communities with little to eat. [...] Having no place to turn, they flocked to the neighborhood of the army camps. There, they were as often treated badly as offered employment and help. The New York Tribune's correspondent reported that one enterprising and unscrupulous officer was caught in the act of assembling a cargo of Negroes for transportation and sale in Cuba [...]\\". Abuses by Union troops continued even after a stable regime had been established.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 240. \\"Violent examples of race hatred could be found wherever Northern troops came into contact with numbers of freedmen. Even at Port Royal, where Saxton's benevolent protectorate should have deterred overt demonstrations, there were appalling clashes. As late as February of 1863 unruly parties from several regiments, including the 9th New Jersey, the 100th New York, known as 'Les Enfants Perdus', and the 24th Massachusetts, went berserk and terrorized St. Helena Island. They killed and stole livestock, took money from the Negroes, and culminated their outrages in burning all the Negro cabins on the Daniel Jenkins plantations. They beat Negro men and attempted to rape the women, and when the superintendents intervened the soldiers threatened to shoot them.\\" Gullah slaves had farmed the Sea Islands for several generations. Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase had in December deployed Colonel William H. Reynolds to collect and sell whatever cotton could be confiscated from the Sea Island plantations.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 19. Soon after, Chase deployed Edward Pierce (after his brief period at Grand Contraband Camp) to assess the situation in Port Royal.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 421. Pierce found a plantation under strict Army control, paying wages too low to enable economic independence; he also criticized the Army's policy of shipping cotton North to be ginned.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 24‚Äì25. Pierce reported that the black workers were experts in cotton farming but required white managers \\"to enforce a paternal discipline\\". He recommended the establishment of a supervised black farming collective to prepare the workers for the responsibilities of citizenship‚Äîand to serve as a model for post-slavery labor relations in the South.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 29.Edward L. Pierce, The Negroes at Port Royal: Report of E. L. Pierce, Government Agent, to the Hon. Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury; Boston: R. F. Walcutt, 1862; letter dated 3 February 1862. \\"The laborers themselves, no longer slaves of their former masters, or of the Government, but as yet in large numbers unprepared for the full privileges of citizens, are to be treated with sole reference to such preparation.\\" The Treasury Department sought to raise money and in many cases was already leasing occupied territories to Northern capitalists for private management. For Port RoyalRose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 32. \\"The government would undoubtedly take steps to put the cotton lands under cultivation, but Pierce was well aware that there was a plan alternative to his own that had very serious backing. While he was asking the government to gamble on the success of a novel agricultural experiment, Colonel Reynolds proposed leasing the plantations and the laborers to a private organization. Reynolds' plan had the merit of simplicity and much better prospects of immediate revenue to the government.\\" Colonel Thomas had already prepared an arrangement of this type; but Pierce insisted that Port Royal offered the chance to \\"settle a great social question\\": namely, whether \\"when properly organized, and with proper motives set before them, [blacks] will as freemen be as industrious as any race of men are likely to be in this climate.\\"Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 32‚Äì33. Chase sent Pierce to see President Lincoln. As Pierce later described the encounter: Pierce accepted this reluctant mandate, but feared that \\"some unhappy compromise\\" might compromise his plan to engineer black citizenship.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 34. \\"The young lawyer undoubtedly had hoped to hear some reassuring word from Lincoln about the future status of the Negroes at Port Royal. This was a point that had disturbed many prospective supporters of the educational work, for they feared that after being treated as freemen and trained to support themselves the Negroes might become the victims of 'some unhappy compromise.'\\" Port Royal Experiment The collective was established and became known as the Port Royal Experiment: a possible model for black economic activity after slavery. The Experiment attracted support from Northerners like economist Edward Atkinson, who hoped to prove his theory that free labor would be more productive than slave labor.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 37‚Äì38. More traditional abolitionists like Maria Weston Chapman also praised Pierce's plan. Civic groups like the American Missionary Association provided enthusiastic assistance.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 40. These sympathetic Northerners quickly recruited a boatload (53 chosen from a pool of applicants several times larger) of Ivy League and divinity school graduates who set off for Port Royal on March 3, 1862.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 43‚Äì44. The residents of Port Royal generally resented the military and civilian occupiers, who exhibited racist superiority in varying degrees of overtness.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 64‚Äì66, 159‚Äì160. Joy turned to sorrow when, on May 12 Union soldiers arrived to draft all able-bodied black men previously liberated on April 13, 1862, by General David Hunter who proclaimed slavery abolished in Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 144‚Äì146. Hunter kept his regiment even after Lincoln reversed this tri-state emancipation proclamation; but disbanded almost all of it when unable to draw payroll from the War Department.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 189. Black farmers preferred to grow vegetables and catch fish, whereas the missionaries (and other whites on the islands) encouraged monoculture of cotton as a cash crop.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 226. In the thinking of the latter, civilization would be advanced by incorporating blacks into the consumer economy dominated by Northern manufacturing.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 226‚Äì228. \\"It is this exclusive preoccupation with cotton that has given most support to the idea that the planter-missionaries were pure economic imperialists [...]. Their vision of the freed people as agricultural peasants devoted to a single-crop economy and educated to a taste for consumer goods supplied by Northern factories fulfils the classic pattern of tributary economics the world over. It is important to remember that at this early time there seemed nothing conspiratorial about this.\\" Meanwhile, various conflicts arose among the missionaries, the Army, and the merchants whom Chase and Reynolds had invited to Port Royal in order to confiscate all that could be sold.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 66‚Äì67. On balance, however, the white sponsors of the Experiment had perceived positive results; businessman John Murray Forbes in May 1862 called it \\"a decided success\\", announcing that Blacks would indeed work in exchange for wages.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 141. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton appointed General Rufus Saxton as military governor of Port Royal in April 1862, and by December Saxton was agitating for permanent black control over the land. He won support from Stanton, Chase, Sumner, and President Lincoln, but met continuing resistance from a tax commission that wanted to sell the land.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 428. Saxton also received approval to train a black militia, which formally became the 1st South Carolina Volunteers on January 1, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation legalized its existence.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 191‚Äì194. Landownership in the Sea Islands As elsewhere, black workers felt strongly that they had a claim to the lands they worked. The Confiscation Act of 1862 allowed the Treasury Department to sell many captured lands on the grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 8. Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied by blacks and missionaries.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 200‚Äì204. The stakes were high: the Sea Island cotton harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 56. Most of the whites involved in the project felt that black ownership of the land should be its final result. Saxton‚Äîalong with journalists including Free South editor James G. Thompson, and missionaries including Methodist minister Mansfield French‚Äîlobbied hard for distribution of the land to black owners.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 55. In January 1863, Saxton unilaterally halted the Treasury Department's tax sale on the grounds of military necessity. The tax commissioners conducted the auction regardless, selling ten thousand acres of land.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 9. Eleven plantations went to a consortium (\\"The Boston Concern\\") headed by Edward Philbrick, who sold the land in 1865 to black farmers.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 212‚Äì213, 298. One black farming collective outbid the outside investors, paying an average of $7.00 per acre for the 470 plantation on which they already lived and worked. Overall, the majority of the land was sold to Northern investors and remained under their control. In September 1863, Lincoln announced a plan to auction 60,000 acres of South Carolina land in lots of 320 acres‚Äîsetting aside 16,000 acres of the land for \\"heads of families of the African race\\", who could obtain 20-acre lots sold at $1.25/acre.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 272. Tax Commissioner William Brisbane envisioned racial integration on the islands, with large plantation owners employing landless blacks.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 281. But Saxton and French considered the 16,000-acre reserve to be inadequate, and instructed black families to stake claims and build houses on all 60,000 acres of the land.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 274‚Äì275. French traveled to Washington in December 1863 to lobby for legal confirmation of the plan.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 284. At French's urging, Chase and Lincoln authorized Sea Island families (and solitary wives of soldiers in the Union Army) to claim 40-acre plots. Other individuals over the age of 21 would be allowed to claim 20 acres. These plots would be purchased at $1.25 per acre, with 40% paid upfront and 60% paid later. With a requirement of six months' prior residency, the order functionally restricted settlement to blacks, missionaries, and others who were already involved in the Experiment.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 57. Claims to land under the new plan began to arrive immediately, but Commissioner Brisbane ignored them, hoping for another reversal of the decision in Washington.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 287. Chase did indeed reverse his position in February, restoring the plan for a tax sale.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 290. The sale took place in late February, with land selling for an average price of more than $11/acre.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 294. The sale provoked outcry from freedpeople who had already claimed land according to Chase's December order.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 295. \\"There were ample signs of impending trouble. A group of superintendents returning to St. Helena from the sale of February 26 were met near Land's End by a crowd of freed people, who surrounded them clamoring for information and 'complaining that their land‚Äîthat they had pre-empted‚Äîhad been sold away from them, and declaring that they wouldn't work for the purchaser.'\\" \\"Negroes of Savannah\\" Major General William Tecumseh Sherman's \\"March to the Sea\\" brought a massive regiment of the Union Army to the Georgia coast in December 1864. Accompanying the Army were an estimated ten thousand black refugees, former slaves. This group was already suffering from starvation and disease.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), p. 109.Drago, \\"How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves\\" (1973), p. 363. Many former slaves had become disillusioned by the Union Army, having suffered pillaging, rape, and other abuses.Drago, How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves (1973), pp. 369‚Äì371. They arrived in Savannah \\"after long marches and severe privations, weary, famished, sick, and almost naked.Drago, \\"How Sherman's March Through Georgia Affected the Slaves\\" (1973), p. 372; quoting the Augusta Daily Constitutionalist, 29 January 1865. On December 19, Sherman dispatched many of these slaves to Hilton Head, an island already serving as refugee camp. Saxton reported on December 22 \\"Every cabin and house on these islands is filled to overflowing‚ÄîI have some 15,000.\\" 700 more arrived on Christmas.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), p. 110. On January 11, 1865, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton arrived in Savannah with Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs and other officials. This group met with Generals Sherman and Saxton to discuss the refugee crisis. They decided, in turn, to consult leaders from the local Black community and ask them: \\"What do you want for your own people?\\" A meeting was duly arranged.James, \\"Sherman at Savannah\\" (1954), p. 127. At 8:00 PM on January 12, 1865, Sherman met with a group of twenty people, many of whom had been slaves for most of their lives. The blacks of Savannah had seized the opportunity of emancipation to strengthen their community's institutions, and they had strong political feelings.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), pp. 99‚Äì102. They selected one spokesperson: Garrison Frazier, the 67-year-old former pastor of Third African Baptist. In the late 1850s, he had for $1,000 bought freedom for himself and his wife.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), p. 106. Frazier had consulted with the refugees as well as the other representatives. He told Sherman: \\"The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor.\\" Frazier suggested that young men would serve the government in fighting the Rebels, and that therefore \\"the women and children and old men\\" would have to work this land. Almost all of those present agreed to request land grants for autonomous black communities, on the grounds that racial hatred would prevent economic advancement for blacks in mixed areas.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 429.An account of this meeting was published on 13 February 1865 in the New York Daily Tribune as \\"Negroes of Savannah\\". A copy of the Daily Tribune article is held by the US National Archives and can be found here transcribed by the National Park Service. According to Adjutant General Edward D. Townsend, the formal exchange represents a verbatim account of the meeting: \\"I do hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and faithful report of the questions and answers made by the colored ministers and church members of Savannah in my presence and hearing, at the chambers of Major-Gen. Sherman, on the evening of Thursday, Jan 12, 1865. The questions of Gen. Sherman and the Secretary of War were reduced to writing and read to the persons present. The answers were made by the Rev. Garrison Frazier, who was selected by the other ministers and church members to answer for them. The answers were written down in his exact words, and read over to the others, who one by one expressed his concurrence or dissent as above set forth.\\" Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15 Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15, issued on January 16, 1865, instructed officers to settle these refugees on the Sea Islands and inland: 400,000 total acres divided into 40-acre plots.Henry Louis Gates, Jr., \\"The Truth Behind '40 Acres and a Mule'\\", The Root, 7 January 2013.Order by the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi. Though mules (beasts of burden used for plowing) were not mentioned, some of its beneficiaries did receive them from the army.\\"Reconstruction ... Forty Acres and a Mule\\" at American Experience website. Such plots were colloquially known as \\"Blackacres\\", which may have a basis for their origin in contract law. Sherman's orders specifically allocated \\"the islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. Johns River, Florida.\\" The order specifically prohibits whites from settling in this area. Saxton, who, with Stanton, helped to craft the document, was promoted to Major General and charged with oversight of the new settlement.Buescher, John. \\"Forty Acres and a Mule.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Retrieved 13 July 2011. On February 3, Saxton addressed a large freedpeople's meeting at Second African Baptist, announcing the order and outlining preparations for new settlement.James, \\"Sherman at Savannah\\" (1954), p. 135.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), pp. 111‚Äì112. By June 1865, about 40,000 freedpeople were settled on in the Sea Islands.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 330.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), pp. 112‚Äì113. The Special Field Orders were issued by Sherman, not the federal government with regards to all former slaves, and he issued similar ones \\"throughout the campaign to assure the harmony of action in the area of operations.\\"\\"Harmony of Action\\" ‚Äì Sherman as an army group commander. Sherman himself later said that these settlements were never intended to last. However, this was never the understanding of the settlers‚Äînor of General Saxton, who said he asked Sherman to cancel the order unless it was meant to be permanent.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 429. \\"But the freedmen quite naturally anticipated permanent possession; and Saxton later testified that he had begged not to be charged with carrying out Sherman's order if the freedmen's expectations were once again to be broken, and that he had received assurances from Secretary Stanton that the Negroes would retain possession of the land.\\" In practice, the areas of land settled were quite variable. James Chaplin Beecher observed that the \\"so called 40 acre tract[s] vary in size from eight acres to (450) four hundred and fifty.\\"Saville, The Work of Reconstruction (1994), pp. 19‚Äì20. Some areas were settled by groups: Skidaway Island was colonized by a group of over 1000 people, including Reverend Ulysses L. Houston.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), p. 113. Significance The Sea Islands project reflected a policy of \\"40 acres and a mule\\" as the basis for post-slavery economics. Especially in 1865, the precedent it set was highly visible to newly free blacks seeking land of their own.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 54‚Äì55. > 'Forty acres and a mule', that delightful bit of myopic mythology so often > ascribed to the newly freed in the Reconstruction period, at least in South > Carolina during the spring and summer of 1865, represented far more than the > chimerical rantings of the ignorant darkies, irresponsible soldiers\\", and > radical politicians. On the contrary, it symbolized precisely the policy > which the government had already given and was giving mass application in > the Sea Islands. Hardly had the troops landed, in November, 1861, before > liberal Northerners arrived to begin a series of ambitious experiment in the > reconstruction of Southern society.

By the Spring of > 1865, this program was well underway, and after August any well-informed > intelligent observer in South Carolina would have concluded, as did the > Negroes, that some considerable degree of permanent land division was highly > probable. Freedpeople from across the region flocked to the area in search of land.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 47‚Äì48. \\"By summer of 1865, word of Sherman's Special Field Order, No. 15 had spread throughout the states covered by the order as well as to neighboring states. So great was the desire for land that blacks poured into the reservation in search of their forty-acre plots.\\" The result was refugee camps afflicted by disease and short on supplies.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 332. Especially after Sherman's Orders, the coastal settlements generated enthusiasm for a new society that would supplant the slave system. Reported one journalist in April 1865: \\"It was the Plymouth colony repeating itself. They agreed if any others came to join them, they should have equal privileges. So blooms the Mayflower on the South Atlantic Coast.\\"Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 331. Wage labor system Beginning in occupied Louisiana under General Nathaniel P. Banks, the military developed a wage-labor system for cultivating large areas of land. This system‚Äîwhich took effect with Lincoln and Stanton's blessing soon after the Emancipation Proclamation legitimized contracts with the freedpeople‚Äîoffered ironclad one-year contracts to freedpeople. The contract promised $10/month as well as provisions and medical care. The system was soon also adopted by General Lorenzo Thomas in Mississippi.Belz, A New Birth of Freedom (2000), pp. 45‚Äì46. Sometimes land came under the control of Treasury officials. Jurisdictional disputes erupted between the Treasury Department and the military.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 425. \\"Disposition of lands and indirectly of Negro labor through Treasury agents to northern lessees brought forth even greater condemnation than direct military supervision. [...] The investigations of James E. Yeatman for the Western Sanitary Commission late in 1863 revealed shocking exploitation and abuse of freedmen working the leased plantations. Attempts during 1864 to remedy those abuses resulted in confusion and conflict of authority between army officers and Treasury agents.\\" Criticism of Treasury Department profiteering by General John Eaton and journalists who witnessed the new form of plantation labor influenced public opinion in the North and pressured Congress to support direct control of land by freedmen.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), pp. 425‚Äì426. \\"There can be no doubt that these varied wartime experiences, together with the criticism and publicity they evoked, affected the Freedmen's Bureau legislation. They make clear what the framers of its final version were attempting to avoid, namely, government plantation operation, exploitation of Negro labor by northern speculators, abuse and rigorous control of freedmen by southern planters whether in violation of military directives or in collusion with military personnel, even the minute paternalistic regulations drawn to safeguard the freedmen that might lead to a permanent 'pupilage'.\\" The Treasury Department, particularly as Secretary Chase prepared to seek the Republican nomination in 1864, accused the military of treating the freedpeople inhumanely. Lincoln decided in favor of military rather than Treasury jurisdiction, and the wage labor system became more deeply established.Belz, A New Birth of Freedom (2000), p. 47. Abolitionist critics of the policy called it no better than serfdom.Belz, A New Birth of Freedom (2000), pp. 52‚Äì53. Davis Bend One of the largest black landownership projects took place at Davis Bend, Mississippi, the 11,000-acre site of plantations owned by Joseph Davis and his famous younger brother Jefferson, president of the Confederacy. Influenced by some aspects of Robert Owen's socialism, Joseph Davis had established the experimental 4000-acre Hurricane Plantation in 1827 at Davis Bend.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 3‚Äì9. \\"The reformer was criticized not so much for his practical failures as for his open rejection of orthodox religion and the institution of marriage. Although Davis did not agree with these radical ideas, he continued to admire the Scottish utopian for his innovative theories. However, the new planter proposed to adopt only the elements of Owen's philosophy that would promote his goal of an efficient, prosperous plantation community.\\" Davis allowed several hundred slaves to eat nutritious food, live in well-built cottages, receive medical care, and resolve their disputes in a weekly \\"Hall of Justice\\" court. His motto was: \\"The less people are governed, the more submissive they will be to control.\\"Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 11‚Äì16. Davis relied heavily on the managerial skills of Ben Montgomery, a well-educated slave who conducted much of the plantation's business. The Battle of Shiloh began a period of turmoil (1862‚Äì1863), at Davis Bend, although its black residents continued farming. The plantation was occupied by two companies of black Union troops in December 1863. Under the command of Colonel Samuel Thomas, these soldiers began to fortify the area. General Ulysses S. Grant had expressed a desire to make of the Davis plantations \\"a negro paradise.\\" Thomas began to lease the land to black tenants for the 1864 crop season.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 38‚Äì 47.Foner, Reconstruction (2011), p. 59. Black refugees who had gathered in Vicksburg moved en masse to Davis Bend under the auspices of the Freedman's Department (an agency created by the military prior to Congressional authorization of the \\"Freedmen's Bureau\\", discussed below).Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 17. Davis Bend was caught in the middle of the turf war between the military and the Treasury Department. In February 1864, the Treasury re-confiscated 2000 acres of Davis Bend, restoring them to white owners who had sworn loyalty oaths.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), p. 39. It also leased 1,200 acres to Northern investors.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), p. 50. Although Thomas resisted instructions to prevent the free blacks from farming, General Eaton ordered him to comply. Eaton also ordered Thomas to confiscate farming equipment held by blacks, on the grounds that‚Äîbecause Mississippi law banned slaves from owning property‚Äîthey must have stolen such possessions. The Treasury Department sought to charge the plantation workers a fee for using the cotton gin. The residents of Davis Bend objected strenuously to these measures. In a petition signed by 56 farmers (including Montgomery) and published in the New Orleans Tribune:29 July 1865; quoted in Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 27. > At the commencement of our present year, this plantation was, in compliance > with an order of our Post Commander, deprived of horses, mules, oxen and > farming utensils of every description, very much of which had been captured > and brought into Union lines by the undersigned; in consequence of which > deprivations, we were, of course, reduced to the necessity of buying > everything necessary for farming, and having thus far succeeded in > performing by far the most expensive and laborious part of our work, we are > prepared to accomplish the ginning, pressing, weighing, marking, consigning, > etc., in a business-like order if allowed to do so. Freedmen's Bureau From 1863‚Äì1865, Congress debated what policies it might adopt to address the social issues that would confront the South after the war. The Freedmen's Aid Society pushed for a \\"Bureau of Emancipation\\" to assist in the economic transition away from slavery. It used Port Royal as evidence that blacks could live and work on their own.Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), pp. 336‚Äì338. Land reform was often discussed, though some objected that too much capital would be required to ensure the success of black farmers. On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives approved the 13th Amendment, which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except in the case of punishment. Congress continued to debate the economic and social status of the free population, with land reform identified as critical to realizing black freedom.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 413. \\"Only a few weeks earlier the members of Congress by their approval of the Thirteenth Amendment had agreed that henceforth the Negro was to be a free man, never again a slave; now they took action to put him on the road to economic independence of the type traditional to free men in the 19th-century agrarian Republic, namely, ownership of the land that he tilled.\\"Rose, Rehearsal for Reconstruction (1964), p. 339. \\"With the approval of the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress had put its blessing on the free status of Negro Americans; the land provision of the Bureau Act was the natural response of a nation of small farmers to set the black man on the road to economic freedom. The purpose of the Bureau itself was to assure a reasonable and temporary protection for the Negro as he passed into his new condition.\\" A bill drafted in conference committee to provide limited land tenure for one year while authorizing military supervision of freedmen was rejected in the Senate by abolitionists who thought it did not do justice to the freedmen.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 417. \\"The chief spokesmen for the Republican opposition were James W. Grimes of Iowa, Henry S. Lane of Indiana, and John P. Hale of New Hampshire, all antislavery men who feared that the supervision provided for the freedmen might lead to their abuse. As the New York Herald reported with some satisfaction, the Freedmen's Bureau bill 'was killed by its friends,' a display of independence towards Sumner which the paper found 'quite refreshing.'\\" A six-person committee quickly wrote \\"an entirely new bill\\" which substantially increased its promise to the freedmen.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 418. Cox quotes \\"an entirely new bill\\" from the Congressional Globe, 3 March 1865, p. 1042. This stronger version of the bill passed both houses on March 3, 1865. With this bill, Congress established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands under the War Department. The Bureau had authority to provide supplies for refugees‚Äîand an unfunded mandate to redistribute land, in parcels of up to 40 acres:Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 20‚Äì21. > Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That the commissioner, under the > direction of the President, shall have authority to set apart, for the use > of loyal refugees and freedmen, such tracts of land within the > insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United > States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and > to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there > shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land, and the person to > whom it was so assigned shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of the > land for the term of three years at an annual rent not exceeding six per > centum upon the value of such land, as it was appraised by the state > authorities in the year eighteen hundred and sixty, for the purpose of > taxation, and in case no such appraisal can be found, then the rental shall > be based upon the estimated value of the land in said year, to be > ascertained in such manner as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. > At the end of said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of > any parcels so assigned may purchase the land and receive such title thereto > as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land, > as ascertained and fixed for the purpose of determining the annual rent > aforesaid. The bill thus established a system in which Southern blacks could lease abandoned and confiscated land, with yearly rent at 6% (or less) of the land's value (assessed for tax purposes in 1860). After three years, they would have the option to buy this land at full price. The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military because Congress anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners. The bill mandated institutionalized black landownership of the same land that had formerly relied on their unpaid labor.Cox, \\"The Promise of Land for the Freedmen\\" (1958), p. 413. \\"Implicit in the decision was the acceptance of the fact that the freedmen would not be colonized abroad, as Lincoln and many others less concerned with the Negro's welfare had wished, nor even colonized in designated areas within the home boundaries, but that he should remain a basic economic and social element in his southern homeland.\\" After Lincoln's assassination, Andrew Johnson became president. On May 29, 1865, Johnson issued an amnesty proclamation to ordinary Southern citizens who swore loyalty oaths, promising not only political immunity but also return of confiscated property. (Johnson's proclamation excluded Confederate politicians, military officers, and landowners with property worth more than $20,000.) General O. O. Howard, chief of the Freedmen's Bureau, requested an interpretation from Attorney General James Speed regarding how this proclamation would affect the Freedmen's Bureau mandate. Speed replied on June 22, 1865 that the Bureau Commissioner:Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 31.McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), p. 99.Andrew Johnson, Amnesty Proclamation, May 29, 1865. Text.James Speed, \\"Opinion on Duty of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau\\", June 22, 1865. Text. > ... has authority, under the direction of the President, to set apart for > the use of loyal refugees and freedmen the lands in question; and he is > required to assign to every male of that class of persons, not more than > forty acres of such lands. Circular #13 Howard acted quickly based on the authorization from Speed, ordering an inventory of lands available for redistribution and resisting white Southerners' attempts to reclaim property.McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), pp. 100‚Äì101.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 32. At its peak in 1865, the Freedmen's Bureau controlled 800,000‚Äì900,000 acres of plantation lands previously belonging to slave owners.Dalton Conley, \\"Forty Acres and a Mule: What if America Pays Reparations? \\", Contexts 1(3), Fall 2002. This area represented 0.2% of land in the South; ultimately the Johnson proclamation required the Bureau to re-allocate most of it to its former owners. On July 28, 1865, Howard issued \\"Circular no. 13\\", a directive within the Freedmen's Bureau to issue land to refugees and freedmen. Circular no. 13 explicitly instructed Bureau agents to prioritize the Congressional mandate for land distribution over Johnson's amnesty declaration. Its final section clarified: \\"The pardon of the President will not be understood to extend to the surrender of abandoned or confiscated property which by law has been 'set apart for Refugees and Freedmen'\\".McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), pp. 104‚Äì105.O. O. Howard, \\"Circular no. 13\\", July 28, 1865; National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 105, Entry 24, No. 139 Asst Adjutant General Circulars 1865-1869, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, pp. 14-15; transcribed from original by John Soos in August, 2003. With Circular #13, land redistribution was an official policy for the entire South, and understood as such by army officers.McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), p. 105. \\"From July 28, 1865, until the circular order was rescinded in September, region-wide redistribution of abandoned and confiscated lands in the South was the stated policy of an agency of the United States government. It was so understood (if not put into practice) by army officers in the South. Had it been implemented, every freedman would not have gotten forty acres of land, but 20,000 Negro families in all sections of the South would have gotten a start on their own farms.\\" After issuing Circular 13, however, Howard, seemingly unaware of how significant and controversial his instructions might prove, left Washington for a vacation in Maine.McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), pp. 108‚Äì109. \\"It does not seem altogether improbable that Howard was not fully aware of the implications of his Circular. As happened more than once during Reconstruction, the compelling needs of the Negroes drew more radical moves from conservative hands. That the Commissioner was asking the President of the United States to acquiesce to a revolutionary principle of dividing large holdings.\\" President Johnson and others began to counteract the Circular almost immediately. After Johnson ordered the Bureau to restore the estate of a complaining Tennessee plantation owner, General Joseph S. Fullerton suggested to at least one subordinate that Circular #13 \\"will not be observed for the present\\".Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 401. \\"Complaints from aggrieved landowners about the refusal of Freedmen's Bureau officials to relinquish abandoned property soon reached President Johnson, who effectively nullified not only Howard's circular but also the intentions of Congress as expressed in the land provisions of the law creating the bureau. On August 16, intervening on behalf of a pardoned Confederate from his home state of Tennessee, Johnson ordered the bureau to restore the man's estate without delay. 'The same action will be had in all similar cases', he added.\\" When Howard returned to Washington, Johnson ordered him to write a new Circular that would respect his policy of land restoration. Johnson rejected Howard's draft and wrote his own version, which he issued on September 12 as Circular #15‚Äîincluding Howard's name.Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), pp. 402‚Äì403; document transcribed, pp. 431‚Äì432. Circular #15 established strict criteria for designating a property as \\"officially confiscated\\" and had the effect in many places of ending land redistribution completely.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 38. \\"The new circular made the possession of land so uncertain that many bureau agents discontinued their policy of assigning land to the freedmen.\\" Especially during the six-week period between Circular #13 and Circular #15, '40 acres and a mule' (along with other supplies necessary for farming) represented a common promise of Freedmen's Bureau agents. Clinton B. Fisk, Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau for Kentucky and Tennessee, had announced at a black political assembly: \\"They must not only have freedom but homes of their own, thirty or forty acres, with mules, cottages, and schoolhouses etc.\\" A Bureau administrator in Virginia proposed leasing to each family a 40-acre plot of land, a pair of mules, harnesses, a cart, tools, seeds, and food supplies. The family would pay for these supplies after growing crops and selling them.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 79. Black Codes Bureau agents encountered legal problems in allocating land to freedpeople as a result of the \\"Black Codes\\" passed by Southern legislatures in late 1865 and 1866. Some of the new laws prevented black people from owning or leasing land. The Freedmen's Bureau generally treated the black Codes as invalid, based on federal legislation. However, the Bureau was not always able to enforce its interpretation after the Union Army had substantially demobilized.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 191‚Äì192. Colonization and homesteading During and after the war, politicians, generals and others envisioned a variety of colonization plans that would have provided real estate to black families. Although the American Colonization Society had been colonizing more people in Liberia and receiving more donations (almost one million dollars in the 1850s), it did not have the means to respond to mass emancipation.Dyer, \\"The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization\\" (1943), p. 55. Foreign colonization plans Lincoln had long supported colonization as a plausible solution to the problem of slavery, and pursued colonization plans throughout his presidency.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), p. 430. \\"Lincoln held the strong belief that colonization would accomplish a twofold objection: rid the nation of racial strife by ridding the nation of its freedmen, which in effect would render America a white man's country (Richardson, 1907, p. 153).\\" In 1862, Congress approved $600,000 to fund Lincoln's plan for colonizing blacks \\"in a climate congenial to them\\", and granted Lincoln broad executive powers to orchestrate colonization.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), pp. 431‚Äì432. \\"This act made Lincoln the sole authority on all plans involving government-financed colonization, as well as on how the money would be spent. It pushed Lincoln far ahead in the field of those who had dedicated themselves to the colonization of the Negro, reaching back to Thomas Jefferson.\\" Lincoln immediately created an Emigration Office within the Department of the Interior and instructed the State Department to acquire suitable land.Magness & Page, Colonization after Emancipation (2011), pp. 3‚Äì4. The first major plan considered would have sent employed free blacks as coal miners in Chiriqu√≠ Province, Panama (then part of Gran Colombia). Volunteers were promised 40 acres of land and a job in the mines; Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy, whom Lincoln had appointed to oversee the plan, had also purchased mules, yokes, tools, wagons, seeds, and other supplies to support a potential colony. Pomeroy accepted 500 of the 13,700 people who applied for the job. However, the plan was canceled by the end of the year, thanks to a discovery that Chiriqu√≠'s coal was of poor quality.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 4.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), p. 433.Page, \\"Lincoln and Chiriqu√≠ Colonization Revisited\\" (2011). Like Liberia, an independent black nation, Haiti was also considered a good place to colonize freedpeople from the U.S.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), p. 432. \\"Because Haiti and Liberia were black independent republics with climatic and topographical features favorable for Black people, Lincoln considered the two countries prime sites for establishing colonies (Nicolay & Hay, 1890, Vol. 6, p. 168).\\"Page, \\"Lincoln and Chiriqu√≠ Colonization Revisited\\" (2011), p. 314. As the Chiriqu√≠ plan was hitting its stride in 1862, Lincoln was developing another plan to colonize the small island of √éle √† Vache near Haiti.Page, \\"Lincoln and Chiriqu√≠ Colonization Revisited\\" (2011), p. 313. \\"In fact, the president had those two projects under consideration concurrently during late 1862 and early 1863 ‚Äì and even the 'second wave' of imperial schemes should be understood more in reference to their longer life than to the date of their initiation. Personally, Lincoln was keen to experiment with several options and to see what worked best.\\" Lincoln struck a deal with businessman Bernard Kock, who had obtained rights to lease the island for cultivation and wood- cutting.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), p. 436. 453 Blacks, mostly young men from the Tidewater region around occupied Hampton, Virginia, volunteered to colonize the island.Boyd, \\"The √éle a Vache Colonization Venture\\" (1959), p. 51. On April 14, 1863, they left Fort Monroe in the \\"Ocean Ranger\\".Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), pp. 438‚Äì439.Dyer, \\"The Persistence of the Idea of Negro Colonization\\" (1943), pp. 60‚Äì61. Kock confiscated all of the money possessed by the colonists and did not pay their wages. Initial reports suggested dire conditions, though these were later disputed. A number of colonists died in the first year.Boyd, \\"The √éle a Vache Colonization Venture\\" (1959), p. 54. 292 survivors from the original group remained on the island and 73 had moved to Aux Cayes; most were restored to the U.S. by a mission of the Navy in February 1864.Lockett, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Colonization\\" (1991), p. 441.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 5. Congress rescinded Lincoln's colonization authority in July 1863.Boyd, \\"The √éle a Vache Colonization Venture\\" (1959), p. 56. Lincoln continued to pursue colonization plans, particularly in the British West Indies, but none came to fruition. The American Colonization Society settled a few hundred people in Liberia during the war, and several thousand more in the five years following.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 6. Domestic colonization plans Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest had proposed in 1865 before the end of the war to hire black soldiers and freedmen in constructing a railroad for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company, paying them with $1/day and land along the railway line.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 73‚Äì75. This proposal later gained the endorsements of Sherman, Howard, Johnson, and Arkansas Governor Isaac Murphy.Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, pp. 410‚Äì411. Howard transported several hundred freedmen from Alabama to Arkansas for work on the line. He appointed Edward Ord to supervise the project and protect the freedmen from Forrest. Southern Homesteading Act As it became clear that the pool of land available for blacks was rapidly shrinking, the Union discussed various proposals for how blacks might resettle and eventually own their own land. In Virginia, the mass of landless blacks represented a growing crisis‚Äîsoon to be exacerbated by the return of 10,000 black soldiers from Texas. Concerned about a possible insurrection, Colonel Orlando Brown (head of the Freedmen's Bureau in Virginia) proposed relocating Virginia's blacks to Texas or Florida. Brown proposed that the federal government reserve 500,000 acres in Florida for colonization by the soldiers and 50,000 other free blacks from Virginia. Howard took Brown's proposal to Congress.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 81‚Äì83.Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, p. 410. In December 1865, Congress began to debate the \\"Second Freedmen's Bureau bill\\", which would have opened three million acres of unoccupied public land in Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas for homesteading.\\"Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill\\" (introduced December 4, 1865) (An amendment to allow black homesteading on public lands in the North was defeated.) Congress passed the bill in February 1866 but could not override Johnson's veto.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 84‚Äì85. (Congress passed a more limited \\"Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill\\" in July 1866, and did override Johnson's veto.) Howard continued to push for Congress to appropriate land for allocation to freedmen. With support from Thaddeus Stevens and William Fessenden, Congress began to debate a new bill for black settlement of public lands in the South. The result was the Southern Homestead Act, which opened 46,398,544.87 acres of land in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas to homesteading; initially 80-acre parcels (half-quarter section) until June 1868, and thereafter 160-acre parcels (quarter section). Johnson signed this bill and it went into effect on June 21, 1866. Until January 1, 1867, the bill specified, only free blacks and loyal whites would be allowed access to these lands.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 86‚Äì87. Howard, concerned about competition with Confederates that would begin in 1867, ordered Bureau agents to inform free blacks about the Homesteading Act.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 81. Local commissioners did not disseminate the information widely,Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 93. and many freedpeople were unwilling to venture into unknown territory, with insufficient supplies, based only on the promise of land after five years.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 149. Those who did attempt homesteading encountered unreliable bureaucracy that often did not comply with federal law. They also faced extremely harsh conditions, usually on low quality land that had been rejected by white settlers in years past. Nevertheless, free blacks entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads; about 1000 of these eventually resulted in property certificates.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 188. Outcomes Southern land owners regained control over almost all of the land they had claimed before the war. The national dialogue about land ownership as a key to success for freedpeople gave way (in the sphere of white politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of white society in the South, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), p. 122. \\"Throughout the South, freedmen were required to make labor contracts with their former owners, and local Bureau agents were charged to enforce the terms of these agreements. Black refugees from rural counties were returned to their home plantations despite proof that they would be subject to mistreatment. Rather than fostering black independence, the Bureau became an agency to assist Southern whites in perpetuating black subordination. Agents who resisted these perversions of the Bureau's purpose, like Wilder, or Saxton in South Carolina, were dismissed and replaced by officers more amenable to the president and his southern allies.\\" Hopes and expectations Free blacks in the South widely believed that all land would be redistributed to those who had worked on it. They also felt strongly that they had a right to own this land.Foner, \\"Languages of Change\\" (1988), p. 277. \\"Unlike freedmen in other countries, however, American blacks emerged from slavery convinced both that they had a right to a portion of their former owner's land, and that the national government had committed itself to land distribution.\\"Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 397. \\"However long they had been in residence and whatever the legal status of the property they occupied, freedpeople living on federally controlled land considered themselves entitled to security in its possession and use. Their unrequited toil in slavery and their support of the Union during the war gave them, they believed, a claim superior to that of absent, disloyal owners.\\" Many expected this event to occur by Christmas 1865 or New Year's 1866.Wilson, Black Codes (1965), p. 55. \\"Finally, it must be observed that a great deal of the freedmen's idleness stemmed from their almost universal belief that they would receive a gift of land from the federal government at Christmas or New Year's.\\"Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 409.Du Bois, Black Reconstruction, p. 603. Although the freedpeople formed this belief in response to the policies of the Freedmen's Bureau and Circular #13, their hopes were soon downplayed as superstition akin to belief in Santa Claus.McFeely, Yankee Stepfather (1994), p. 105. \\"That Howard and his men, unable to sustain their stated policy, spent the fall trying to make the Negroes believe that forty acres was just 'a la mode Santa Claus' was, in reality, just an admission that a group of white generals had failed their job and not proof that the freedmen were foolish or superstitious.\\"Fleming, \\"Forty Acres and a Mule\\" (1906), p. 46. \\"For several years after the close of the Civil War, the Negroes of the South believed that the estates of the whites were to be confiscated by the Washington Government, and that each Negro head of a family would obtain from the property thus confiscated 'forty acres and a mule.' Some old Negroes still believe that the homestead and the mule will be given to them. This belief has often, especially in late years, been ridiculed as the childish dream of an ignorant people; for it is assumed that the negro had no reason for expecting land and stock from the Government. The purpose of this paper is to show that the expectations of the blacks were justified by the policies of the Government and the actions of its agents, and also to show that rascals took advantage of these expectations to swindle the ignorant freedmen.\\" Hope for \\"40 acres and a mule\\" specifically was prevalent beginning in early 1865. The expectation of \\"40 acres\\" came from the explicit terms of Sherman's Field Order and the Freedmen's Bureau bill. The \\"mule\\" may have been added simply as an obvious necessity for achieving prosperity through agriculture.Webster, Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina (1916), pp. 94‚Äì95. (\\"Forty acres\\" was a slogan, which though it did appear often in formal declarations, represented a wide variety of different arrangements for land ownership and farming.)Saville, The Work of Reconstruction (1994), p. 19. \\"Not only does the 'forty acre' slogan obscure values that are foreign to the idea of land as a commodity, but, by drawing attention to a fixed measure of land, it tends to distort the character of the farming that ex-slaves undertook. Sherman's Field Order 15, issued in January 1865, set forty acres as the maximum amount of land that freed heads of households might claim [...]. Nevertheless, freed families in the low country seldom attempted to cultivate land in lots as large or as regularly defined as forty acres.\\" A counter-rumor spread among Southern whites that when the land was not redistributed on Christmas, angry blacks would launch a violent insurrection. Alabama and Mississippi passed laws forming White paramilitary groups, which violently disarmed free black people.Wilson, Black Codes (1965), p. 56. \\"There was one other erroneous rumor‚Äîto some extent a consequence of the forty-acres-and-a-mule rumor‚Äîwhich contributed to bad race relations in the South in 1865. It was the more foolish‚Äîbecause totally unfounded‚Äîidea that, disappointed at not receiving the expected land, the Negroes would rise in a bloody rebellion at Christmas. Mississippi quickly passed one law providing for the immediate organization of volunteer militia companies and another outlawing possession of weapons by Negroes. The militia proceeded to disarm the Negroes in such a brutal fashion as to cause much criticism. Alabama Negroes were disarmed by similar methods with like results.\\" Wage labor Southern farmowners complained that because they were waiting for land, the newly free blacks would not readily sign long-term labor contracts.Whitelaw Reid, After The War: A Southern Tour (May 1, 1865 to May 1, 1866.) London: Samson Low, Son, & Marston, 1866, p. 336; cited in Foner, \\"Languages of Changes\\" (1988), p. 277.Cohen, At Freedom's Edge (1991), p. 15. \\"The impact of the labor shortage was exacerbated by a black agenda that dovetailed with neither the need of the planters nor the expectations or the Northern occupiers. Seeking independence from white control, they resisted the work forms of slavery, refusing to labor in gangs or to take direction from overseers or even drivers.\\" South Carolina Governor James Lawrence Orr asked Johnson in 1866 to continue pushing his land policy, writing that \\"complete restoration will restore complete harmony\\".Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 74. Black hopes for land came to be seen as a major barrier to economic productivity, and forces from both South and North worked hard to dispel them.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 74‚Äì75.Wilson, Black Codes (1965), p. 57. \\"In a nutshell, the sum of army and Freedmen's Bureau policies was: protect the Negroes from violence and actual enslavement, but keep as many as possible on the plantations and compel them to work. Both agencies preserved 'white man's rule,' and though both of them did, as George Bently said of the Freedmen's Bureau, 'maintain a fairly strong guard against any form of re-enslavement of the Negroes', their interest in the welfare and happiness of the freedmen did not, as a whole, extend far beyond that safeguard in 1865 and 1866. It is also as true of one as of the other that its policies, in the main, were 'those that planters and other businessmen desired.'\\" Southern governments passed \\"Black Codes\\" to prevent blacks from owning or leasing land, and to restrict their freedom of movement.Cohen, At Freedom's Edge (1991), pp. 32‚Äì34. Agents of the Freedmen's Bureau now told blacks that redistribution was impossible and that they would need to perform wage labor to survive. If they could not persuade people to sign contracts, they would insist forcefully.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 90‚Äì93. Thomas Conway, the Bureau Commissioner in Louisiana, ordered: \\"Hire them out! Cut wood! Do anything to avoid a state of idleness.\\"Cohen, At Freedom's Edge (1991), p. 12. Even Rufus Saxton, who campaigned actively for black property in the Sea Islands, issued a Circular instructing his agents to dispel the rumor of redistribution at New Year's 1866. (The unfunded Bureau drew its own finances from profits generated by freedpeople under contract.)Du Bois, Black Reconstruction, p. 602. Although some Whites continued to press for colonization, most now believed that black labor could be recuperated through the wage system.McKenzie, \\"Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South\\" (1993), pp. 68‚Äì69. \\"A majority of white landowners, though, dismissed the twin goals of black colonization and white immigration as impractical and unnecessary and believed it possible to rely upon the labor of the ex-slaves. Most Tennesseans believed that in order to use black labor effectively it would be necessary to restrict the mobility of blacks and to fashion land and labor arrangements that resembled slavery as closely as possible\\". According to many historians, economic negotiations between blacks and whites in the South thus unfolded within the parameters dictated by the Johnson administration.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 96. \\"The broad framework of a new economics for the South was prescribed in the North, but the infinite detail evolved in a species of economic warfare between white employers and Negro employees.\\" Southern plantation owners pushed blacks toward servitude, while the Republican Congress pushed for free wage labor and civil rights.McKenzie, \\"Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South\\" (1993), p. 70. Eventually, under this framework, sharecropping emerged as the dominant mode of production.Cohen, At Freedom's Edge (1991), pp. 20‚Äì21. \\"Croppers had to accept employer supervision of virtually every dimension of their farming activity. [...] Still, at its inception, sharecropping was far more popular among blacks than the annual- wage system.\\" Some historians, such as Robert McKenzie, have challenged the prevalence of this \\"standard scenario\\" and argued that land ownership fluctuated significantly during the 1870s.McKenzie, \\"Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South\\" (1993), pp. 81‚Äì84. \\"Exploration of this sort has proven that, with regard to Tennessee, the standard scenario for the post-emancipation transformation of southern agriculture is factually incorrect in two fundamental respects. First, the institutional reorganization of agriculture in the state was neither swift nor thorough, and it did not result in the immediate predominance of sharecropping among the former slaves. Between 1860 and 1880 the number and average size of farm units across the state underwent major changes, but these reflected first and foremost a remarkable increase in the number of white owners. Although sharecropping and tenancy did grow in importance, as late as 1880 the typical freedman was more likely to have been a wage laborer than a cropper or tenant. Second, despite the continued concentration of blacks at the lowest rung of the agricultural ladder, in Tennessee there was considerable fluidity between the landholding and landless ranks. Throughout the 1870s a small but significant proportion of former slaves purchased farms of their own; at the same time, however, a substantial fraction of those who began the decade as owners had lost title to their farms by 1880\\". Black land ownership did increase across the South. Tidewater Virginia Many blacks who had settled on property surrounding Hampton were forced to leave by various means. These included Johnson's aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 87, 99‚Äì102. Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; many blacks came to trust the Freedmen's Bureau no more than they did the Rebels.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), p. 175.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 102‚Äì104. \\"When the freedmen in Wilder's district were informed of the new policy, they were at first unbelieving, and then infuriated. They suspected that local agents like Wilder were lying to them. When Commissioner Howard and Subcommissioner Brown visited Hampton encouraging freedmen to return to their former homes and work for wages, the black began to realize the truth. It was the president and national government that were defaulting on Northern wartime promises. [...] they armed themselves and threatened to respond violently to any effort to evict them. In such instances, white Union troops, many of whom had recently fought in the same army with these black settlers, were ordered to drive the squatters off restored land at gunpoint.\\" In 1866 Tidewater's refugee camps were still full, and many of their residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern whites had become violently hostile. The whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 113‚Äì115. After the turbulence of restoration, land ownership steadily increased. Hampton already had at least some black landowners, such as the family of American Revolutionary War veteran Caesar Tarrant.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), p. 166. \\"Free Negro ownership of land was not a recent development in Hampton and its environs. As early as 1797, Caesar Tarrant, a black, devised his houses and lots by will to his \\"loving wife.\\" In addition to his Hampton holdings, he owned almost 2,700 acres of bounty land in Ohio, which had been granted to him for his services as a pilot in the Virginia Navy in the American Revolution. His daughter, Nancy Tarrant, was the only Negro landowner in Hampton in 1830.\\" In 1860, about eight free Negroes owned land in Hampton. By 1870, approximately 121 free Blacks owned land in the area.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), p. 177. Those who owned land before the war expanded their holdings.Medford, \\"Land and Labor\\" (1992), 570. Some of the blacks in Hampton formed a community land trust called Lincon's Land Association and purchased several hundred acres of surrounding land.Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 540. Land for the Hampton Institute (later Hampton University), was acquired from 1867‚Äì1872 with assistance from George Whipple of the American Missionary Association.Bonekemper, \\"Negro Ownership of Real Property\\" (1970), p. 176.Jackson, \\"The Origin of Hampton Institute\\" (1925), pp. 145‚Äì146. Whipple also helped to sell 44 individual lots to black owners. Many freedpeople could not afford to purchase land immediately after the war, but earned money in jobs outside farming such as fishing and oystering. Black land ownership thus increased even faster (though not for everyone) during the 1870s.Medford, \\"Land and Labor\\" (1992), pp. 575‚Äì576. \\"With the resources accrued from nonagricultural labor, and the knowledge that they could return to such work at any time, peninsula freedmen and women set out to enter the landed class. In none of the six counties did landholding by blacks becoming commonplace in the years immediately following emancipation. Between 1870 and 1880, however, as conditions stabilized, the quest for land brought better results.\\" In Charles City County, three-quarters of black farm workers owned their own farms, with an average size of 36 acres. In York County, 50% owned their farms, which averaged 20 acres.Medford, \\"Land and Labor\\" (1992), p. 577. (Statedwide, the number of landowners was high, but the average size of land was only 4 acres.)Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 177‚Äì178. These relatively small farms, on relatively poor land, did not generate enormous profits.Medford, \\"Land and Labor\\" (1992), pp. 578‚Äì579. However, they did constitute a base of economic power, and blacks from this region held political office at a high rate.Medford, \\"Land and Labor\\" (1992), p. 581.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), p. 137. Survivors of the camps also achieved a high level of land ownership and business success in the town of Hampton itself.Engs, Freedom's First Generation (1979), pp. 174‚Äì177. Sea Islands The May 29 amnesty proclamation did not apply to many Sea Islands landowners; however, most of these had secured special pardons directly from Johnson.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 49. General Rufus Saxton was overwhelmed with ownership claims for properties in the \\"Sherman Reserve\\".Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 80. Saxton wrote to Howard on September 5, 1865, asking him to protect black landownership on the Sea Islands:Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 402; document transcribed, p. 430. Circular no. 15, issued days later, led the land's former owners to increase their efforts. Saxton continued to resist, passing their written requests to Howard with the comment:Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 51. Johnson dispatched Howard to the Islands, with instructions to broker a \\"mutually satisfactory\\" settlement. Howard understood that this implied a complete restoration of pre-war ownership.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 80‚Äì81. \\"In October, a highly choleric Johnson personally, orally, and explicitly ordered Howard himself to go to South Carolina to effect a settlement 'mutually satisfactory' to the freedmen and the owners. Doubtless as Johnson intended, Howard interpreted this to mean that complete restoration was mandatory.\\" He informed the islanders of Johnson's intention. But (with support from Stanton, who felt comfortable with a literal interpretation of the phrase \\"mutually satisfactory\\")Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 52. \\"He telegraphed Howard at Charleston that the president's order only called for him to see if the freedmen and the former owners could arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement. If they could not, Howard should not have disturbed the freedmen in their possession.\\"Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 406. appointed a sympathetic Captain, Alexander P. Ketchum, to form a commission overseeing the transition.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 81. Ketchum and Saxton proceeded to resist resettlement claims by Confederate whites.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 81‚Äì82. The settlers formed a solidarity network to resist reclamation of their lands, and proved willing to defend their homes with vigorous displays of force.Hahn et al., Land and Labor, 1865 (2008), p. 408. \\"Understanding the importance of solidarity in resisting the landowners' demands, freedpeople organized themselves and forged links with their counterparts on other estates. Led by the committee that had framed the petitions to General Howard and President Johnson, residents of Edisto vowed to 'stand by each other, not for any violent action‚Äîbut simply to refuse to contract for any white owners.'\\" The Sea Island homesteaders also wrote directly to Howard and Johnson, insisting that the government keep its promise and maintain their homesteads. However, the prevailing political wind continued to favor the Southern landowners. Saxton and Ketchum lost their positions; Daniel Sickles and Robert K. Scott assumed power.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 83‚Äì84. In the winter of 1866‚Äì1867, Sickles turned the Union Army on the settlers, evicting all those that could not produce the correct deed. Black settlers retained control over 1,565 titles amounting to 63,000 acres.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), p. 84. \\"During the winter of 1866, Sickles simply used his administrative power to do what Johnson and the owners had been unable to do by judicial and legal means. [...] The refusal of the military to recognize any papers which were in any degree erroneous resulted, finally, in only 1,565 titled (representing about 63,000 acres), being valided. By the same order that disallowed the Negro Code, Sickles also directed freedmen everywhere in the state to contract for the coming year or to leave their places. In February, squads of soldiers went through the plantations forcing those settlers without valid claims either to contract with the owners or leave.\\" Scott recounted in his report to Congress: \\"The officers of these detachments in many instances took from the freedmen their certificates, declared them worthless, and destroyed them in their presence. Upon refusing to accept the contracts offered, the people in several instances were thrust out into the highways, where, being without shelter, many perished from small-pox, which prevailed to an alarming extent among them.\\"Webster, Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina (1916), p. 101; see also Congressional Serial Set, Issue 1276, p. 114.According to Rose (1964) p. 296, small pox was already known as \\"Government lump\\"; Rose explains in a footnote: \\"Those who had the 'lump' were 'Union,' and those who didn't were 'Secesh.'!\\" Soldiers continued to evict settlers and enforce work agreements, leading in 1867 to a large-scale armed standoff between the Army and a group of farmers who would not renew their contract with a plantation owner.Williamson, After Slavery (1965), pp. 92‚Äì93. General Davis Tillson in Georgia ordered a modification to the title of black landowners \\"as to give a man holding one, not forty acres, but as much land as he could work well, say from ten to fifteen acres‚Äîand that the balance of the land should be turned over to Messrs. Scuyler and Winchester, who should be allowed to hire the remaining freed people who wish to work for them [...]\\".Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 65. 90% of the land on Skidaway Island was confiscated.Byrne, \\"Uncle Billy\\" (1995), p. 116. The (second) Second Freedmen's Bureau bill, passed in July 1866 over Johnson's veto, stipulated the freedpeople whose lands had been restored to Confederate owners could pay $1.25 per acre for up to 20 acres of land in St. Luke and St. Helena parishes of Beaufort County, South Carolina.Webster, Operation of the Freedmen's Bureau in South Carolina (1916), p. 102. This district was overseen by Major Martin R. Delaney, an abolitionist and advocate of black land ownership.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 67‚Äì69. About 1,900 families with land titles resettled in Beaufort County, buying 19,040 acres of land at relatively low rates.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 194‚Äì195. Many people remained on the islands and maintained the Gullah culture of their ancestors. Several hundred thousand Gullah people live on the Sea Islands today. Their claim to the land has been threatened in recent decades by developers seeking to build vacation resorts.Dahleen Glanton, \\"Gullah Culture in Danger of Fading Away\\", National Geographic News (Chicago Tribune), 8 June 2001. Davis Bend Thomas denied their request and accused Montgomery of having promoted the petition to further his own profits.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 70‚Äì71. Montgomery appealed to Joseph Davis, who had returned to Mississippi in October 1865 and was staying in Vicksburg. Samuel Thomas was eventually removed from his post. Joseph Davis regained control of his plantation in 1867 and promptly sold it to Benjamin Montgomery for $300,000.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), p. 104. This price, $75 per acre, was comparatively low.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), pp. 109‚Äì110. The transaction itself was illegal because the Mississippi Black Codes outlawed sale of property to blacks; Davis and Montgomery therefore conducted the deal in secret.Hermann, Pursuit of a Dream (1981), p. 110. Montgomery invited free blacks to settle the land and work there. In 1887, led by Benjamin's son Isaiah Montgomery, the group founded a new settlement at Mound Bayou, Mississippi.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 168‚Äì169. Mound Bayou remains an autonomous and virtually all- Black community.Angela Hua, \\"Life in Mound Bayou, Mississippi: Findings from a Community Survey\\"; University of Michigan School of Public Health report, 2010. Politics 15th Amendment, or the Darkey's millennium - 40 acres of land and a mule, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views. Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner continued to support land reform for freedpeople, but were opposed by a large bloc of politicians who did not want to violate property rights or redistribute capital.Du Bois, Black Reconstruction, p. 368. Many radical Northerners withdrew their support for land reform in the years following the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), pp. 172‚Äì174. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.Du Bois, Black Reconstruction, pp. 222‚Äì223. Legacy By the 1870s, blacks had abandoned hope of federal land redistribution, but many still saw \\"forty acres and a mule\\" as the key to freedom.McKenzie, \\"Freedmen and the Soil in the Upper South\\" (1993), p. 68. \\"Initially the freedmen expected the federal government to facilitate this dream through the redistribution of their masters' plantations. Although forced ultimately to relinquish the hope of federal intervention, they nonetheless held tightly throughout the Reconstruction era to the vision of an independent black yeomanry.\\" Black land ownership in the South increased steadily despite the failure of federal Reconstruction.Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 526. One quarter of black farmers in the South owned their land by 1900. Near the coast, they owned an average of 27 acres; inland, an average of 48 acres.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 196. By comparison, 63% of Southern white farmers owned their land.Oubre, Forty Acres and a Mule (1978), p. 178. Most of this land was simply bought through private transactions. In 1910, black Americans owned 15,000,000 acres of land, most of it in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This figure has since declined to 5,500,000 acres in 1980 and to 2,000,000 acres in 1997.Otabor and Nembhard, Land Loss (2012), p. 2. \\"A picture of the magnitude of the issue of land ownership and record titles is that in 1910, African American land ownership in the United States reached its peak of 15 million acres with nearly all of it in Mississippi, Alabama and the Carolinas, but by 1997 the numbers had declined drastically to about 2.3 million acres (according to Thomas, Pennick and Gray, 2004 based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture). The rate of decline of African‚ÄêAmerican land holdings far exceeds the loss among other ethnic groups. Comparing the rate of African‚ÄêAmerican farmland loss to other groups in 1997, blacks lost fifty‚Äêthree percent (53%) compared to 28.8% for other ethnic groups, while whites experienced steady growth (Civil Rights Action Team, quoted by Gilbert and Sharp, 2002).\\"Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 507. Most of this land is not the area held by black families in 1910; beyond the \\"Black Belt\\", it is located in Texas, Oklahoma, and California.Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 527. The total number of Black farmers has decreased from 925,708 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1997; the number of white farmers has also decreased, but much more slowly. Black American land ownership has diminished more than that of any other ethnic group, while white land ownership has increased. Black families who inherit land across generations without obtaining an explicit title (often resulting in tenancy in common by multiple descendants) may have difficulty gaining government benefits and risk losing their land completely.McDougall, \\"Black Landowners Beware\\" (1979‚Äì1980), pp. 127‚Äì135.Otabor and Nembhard, Land Loss (2012), pp. 3‚Äì4. Outright fraud and lynchings have also been used to strip black people of their land.Otabor and Nembhard, Land Loss (2012), p. 7.McDougall, \\"Black Landowners Beware\\" (1979‚Äì1980), p. 160. Black landowners are common targets of eminent domain laws invoked to make way for public works projects.McDougall, \\"Black Landowners Beware\\" (1979‚Äì1980), pp. 158‚Äì160. At Harris Neck in the Sea Islands, a group of Gullah freedpeople retained 2,681 acres of high-quality land due to the Will of the plantation owner Marg[a]ret Ann Harris. About 100 black farmers continued to live at Harris Neck until 1942, when they were forced off the land because of a plan to build an Air Force base. The land was used freely by local white authorities until 1962, when it was turned over to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and became Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge. Ownership of the land remains contested.Terry Dickson, \\"Families join in new quest for Harris Neck land\\"; Florida Times-Union, 14 January 2007.Shalia Dewan, \\"black Landowners Fight to Reclaim Georgia Home\\"; New York Times, 30 June 2010. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has long been viewed as a cause for the decline in black agriculture. According to a 1997 report by the USDA's own Civil Rights Action Team:\\"Civil Rights at the United States Department of Agriculture: A Report by the Civil Rights Action Team\\", USDA, February 1997, p. 2; quoted in Mitchell (2001), p. 530. > There are some who call the USDA 'the last plantation.' An 'old line' > department, USDA was one of the last federal agencies to integrate and > perhaps the last to include women and minorities in leadership positions. > Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived > as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and > socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan > practices. A class action lawsuit has accused the USDA of systematic discrimination against black farmers from 1981‚Äì1999. In Pigford v. Glickman (1999), District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman ruled in favor of the farmers and ordered the USDA to pay financial damages for loss of land and revenue.Otabor and Nembhard, Land Loss (2012), pp. 9‚Äì10. However, the status of full compensation for affected farmers remains unresolved.Otabor and Nembhard, Land Loss (2012), pp. 10‚Äì11. Symbolism The phrase \\"40 acres and a mule\\" has come to symbolize the broken promise that Reconstruction policies would offer economic justice for African Americans.Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 506. The \\"40 acres and a mule\\" promise featured prominently in the Pigford decision. Ruling that the United States Department of Agriculture had discriminated against African-American farmers, Friedman wrote: \\"Forty acres and a mule. The government broke that promise to African American farmers. Over one hundred years later, the USDA broke its promise to Mr. James Beverly.\\"Mitchell, \\"From Reconstruction to Deconstruction\\" (2001), p. 505. Reparations \\"40 Acres and a Mule\\" is often discussed in the context of reparations for slavery. However, strictly speaking, the various policies offering 'forty acres' provided land for political and economic reasons‚Äîand with a price tag‚Äîand not as unconditional compensation for lifetimes of unpaid labor.Adjoa A. Aiyetoro, \\"Formulating Reparations Litigation Through the Eyes of the Movement\\", NYU Annual Survey of American Law 58; 18 February 18, 2003, pp. 458‚Äì460. \\"However, this land was not a gift in recognition of the forced free labor that had been extracted from the refugees and the freed men and women and the inhumane treatment to which they and their ancestors had been subjected. Rather, the loyal refugees and freedmen chosen to receive this land were required to pay annually a rent [...]\\".

The series originally aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from February 1, 1990 to February 12, 1991 for a total of 54 episodes. Saban Entertainment picked up the North American rights to the series in 1991 and produced a 52-episode English adaption. When Saban licensed the English version, proper translations of and information about the original Japanese episodes were either of poor quality or non-existent. It was decided to write completely original dialogue for the English dub, playing the show as a wacky, Animaniacs-esque comedy in contrast to the less farcical original. The English-language version became a cult hit among anime fans due to its rapid-fire pop-culture references and farcical nature. Saban's distribution rights to the series expired on November 12th, 2000. Discotek Media currently holds the North American home video license to the series in North America, while Madman Entertainment holds the license for Australia and New Zealand. Crunchyroll began streaming the series on December 27, 2015. The series became available for streaming to Amazon Prime subscribers in late 2018. In 2020, it became available on Tubi. Plot The series is set in Little Tokyo, a mechanical city which fuses feudal Japanese culture with contemporary culture, and is populated by cybernetic anthropomorphic animals. The city is nominally led by Emperor Fred, a doddering eccentric. The city's actual leadership lies in the hands of the city council and the emperor's daughter, Princess Violet. The council is headed by ambitious Prime Minister Seymour \\"The Big\\" Cheese, a rat who constantly plots to overthrow the Emperor. Big Cheese is aided by his inept minions: trusted adviser Jerry Atric and Bad Bird, the leader of an army of ninja crows. Unknown to the prime minister, council member and palace guard commander \\"Big Al\\" Dente has learned of his designs on leadership, but is unable to prosecute him for treason because of the plausible deniability he maintains. Instead, Al Dente enlists the services of Speedy Cerviche, Polly Esther, and Guido Anchovy, three cyborg cat samurai who work in the city's pizzeria, along with their operator Francine. Known collectively as the Samurai Pizza Cats, the three are assigned to stop Big Cheese and his evil henchmen's plans to take over Little Tokyo. Characters Production When Saban Entertainment licensed Kyatto Ninden Teyandee, 52 of the 54 episodes that were produced in Japan were translated into English. The two untranslated episodes were clip shows that did little to further the series' plot. Some episodes of the dubbed version were never aired in the United States due to censorship issues. The music in the English dub (replacing the original Japanese music) was by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (credited as Kussa Mahchi). In keeping with the parodic nature of the show, the lyrics of the new theme song make a number of references to American pop culture.For example, the line \\"they've got more fur than any turtle ever had\\" references the similarly themed cartoon series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, while the line \\"they're stronger than old cheese, stronger than dirt\\" refers to an advertising slogan once used for the industrial cleaner Ajax. The theme song also contains the line \\"As soon as someone finds the script, we might begin the show\\", a reference to the lack of proper translations given to Saban for production on the American version (). Michael Airington, a writer for the series, also sang the theme song (in an impersonated Paul Lynde voice), being credited as \\"Singing Sensation: Googie Gomez\\". According to the producer Andy Thomas, Airington had a few drinks before the recording session for the song started, and as a result, accidentally stuttered on one line (\\"this cat gets down down with a love hangover\\"); that mistake was kept in the final version of the theme.  Broadcast The English version of the series first aired in United Kingdom on ITV in 31st August 1991, Date: Saturday, Aug. 31, 1991 Publication: The Times (London, England) Issue: 64113 with repeats continuing until 1995. In Canada the series first appear in 1993 on YTV and in 1996 in the United States on first-run syndication. The series was broadcast on Australian television on the weekday Seven Network morning kid's wrapper programme Agro's Cartoon Connection from April 1992. A repeat run occurred in the same time slot in early 1994. Release Samurai Pizza Cats has been broadcast in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Colombia, India, Spain, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, France, Italy, Poland, Greece, the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, Chile, Peru, Panama, Hong Kong, Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Israel, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Sweden, Armenia, the Philippines, the United States, Portugal, Nigeria and Russia from 1991 onwards. Discotek Media released the show in both the original Japanese- language version and the North American English-language version dubbed by Saban. DVDs were released in region 1 format, with the Japanese version in Dolby Stereo 2.0 and English version in Dolby Digital Mono. The Kyatto-Ninden Teyandee: Complete Uncut Japanese Language Collection was released on April 30, 2013 and the English-dubbed version, Samurai Pizza Cats: Complete English Language TV Series Collection ‚Äì 8 Disc Set, was released on July 30, 2013. The Kyatto-Ninden Teyandee: Complete Uncut Japanese Language Collection set includes all of the 54 original episodes (including the two clip-show episodes that were never dubbed into English) while the Samurai Pizza Cats: Complete English Language TV Series Collection set includes all 52 English-dubbed episodes. A French-language version, titled Samoura√Ø Pizza Cats, which features a French dub adapted from the English dub, was released on DVD in France by Declic Images across two 5-disc box sets (26 episodes per set) in 2004. Madman Entertainment released the show on DVD for Australia initially in two collections, with four discs in each set. Collection 1, containing episodes 1‚Äì26, was released on October 16, 2013; collection 2 containing episodes 27‚Äì52, was released on December 4, 2013. A box set of the complete series was released by Madman on April 6, 2016. Discotek Media released the Samurai Pizza Cats: The Complete Collection on Blu-ray on January 19, 2016. This release featured every episode in standard definition on a single disk. Merchandise Various toys and model kits were released in both Japan and Europe by Bandai, the latter usually being reboxed versions of the prior. Action figures for the Samurai Pizza Cats and the Rescue Team (the Japanese originals came as model kits comparable to today's Gundam toys, while the European figures came pre-assembled). There were also both large and small (Gachapon-sized) rubber-like figures and playsets for the smaller figures, including the Great Catatonic and the pizza parlor. Video game In 1991, Tecmo published a platform video game based on Kyatto Ninden Teyandee for the Famicom (NES) in Japan. The main characters of the series were also intended at one point to appear in the Wii fighting game Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars. The game's producer, Ryota Niitsuma, was quoted in an interview as saying: \\"One of the main anime we got more requests for than any others was Samurai Pizza Cats... I wanted to see that, but we couldn't reach an agreement.\\" American Comics Samurai Pizza Cats comics were released as back-up stories in Saban Powerhouse (published by Valiant/Acclaim) which ran for two issues in 1997.

The movement largely focuses on music, mixing regional rhythms of Brazilian Northeast, such as maracatu, frevo, coco and forr√≥, with rock, hip hop, funk and electronic music. Overview The movement has its own manifesto, Caranguejos com C√©rebro (or \\"Crabs with Brains\\" in English), written in 1992 by singer Fred 04 and DJ Renato L. Its title refers to Recife's inhabitants as crabs living in Recife's mangrove environment. A major symbol associated with mangue bit is that of an antenna stuck in the mud receiving signals from all over the world. Mangue bit can be divided into two distinct waves: the first in the early 1990s led by the music groups Chico Science & Na√ß√£o Zumbi (Zumbi's Nation) and Mundo Livre S/A (Free World Inc.), and the second in the early 2000s led by Re:Combo (a copyleft movement that uploads half-sampled music for download) and Cordel do Fogo Encantado (a music group that started as a roving theatre troupe with roots in a form of literature known as literatura de cordel (\\"twine literature\\")). The original movement named itself mangue bit, mangue referring to Recife's mangroves and bit to the computer bit central to the movement's electronic music influences.

The plot is adapted from the 1965‚Äì1968 CBS television series of the same name (itself inspired by the 1812 novel The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann David Wyss). Several actors from the TV show make cameo appearances. The film focuses on the Robinson family, who undertake a voyage to a nearby star system to begin large-scale emigration from a soon-to-be uninhabitable Earth, but are thrown off course by a saboteur and must try to find their way home. Lost in Space received negative reviews, and grossed $136.2 million worldwide. Plot In 2058, Earth will soon be uninhabitable due to the irreversible effects of pollution and ozone depletion. In an effort to save humanity, the United Global Space Force sends Professor John Robinson, his wife Maureen, daughters Judy and Penny, and young prodigy son Will on the spaceship Jupiter II to complete construction of a hypergate over the planet Alpha Prime, which will allow the population of Earth to be instantly transported and populate the new planet. Penny rebels by breaking curfew, while Will's prize-winning science experiment involving time travel goes largely unnoticed by John. Global Sedition, a mutant terrorist group, assassinates the Jupiter II's pilot, who is replaced by hotshot fighter pilot Major Don West, to his chagrin. The family's physician Dr. Zachary Smith, a Sedition spy, sabotages the ship's on-board robot before launch, but is betrayed by his cohorts and left unconscious as the ship launches and the family enters cryosleep. The robot activates and begins to destroy the navigation and guidance systems, en route to destroying the family. Smith awakens the Robinsons and West, who manage to subdue the robot, but the ship is falling uncontrollably into the sun. Forced to use the experimental hyperdrive with an unplotted course, the ship is transported through hyperspace to a remote planet in an uncharted part of the universe. Passing through a strange distortion in space, the crew finds two abandoned ships in orbit: the Earth ship Proteus, and another ship clearly not of human origin. They board the Proteus, with Will controlling the now- modified robot. They find navigational data to reach Alpha Prime, and a camouflaging creature Penny calls \\"Blarp\\", along with evidence suggesting the ship is from the future. They are attacked by spider-like creatures; one scratches Smith, and the robot's body is irreparably damaged but Will saves its computerized intelligence. West destroys the vessel to eradicate the spiders, causing the ship to crash-land on the nearby planet, where another distortion appears. Will theorizes they are distortions in time, as his experiment predicted, but John ignores his input. Exploring the time bubble, he and West encounter a future version of Will and a robot he rebuilt with the saved intelligence. The older Will explains that surviving spiders killed Maureen, Penny, and Judy. Constructing a time machine, the future Will intends to return to Earth to prevent Jupiter II from launching. Young Will and Smith investigate the time bubble on their own. Smith tricks Will into handing over his weapon, but is foiled by a future version of himself, transformed by his spider injury into a spider-like creature, who has been protecting Will since the rest of the family was killed. The present Will and West return to the Jupiter II with an injured Smith and the robot in tow, while the future Smith reveals his true plan: He killed the Robinsons, but kept Will alive to build the time machine, so Smith could return to Earth and populate it with a race of spiders. John, remembering the spiders eat their wounded, rips open Smith's egg sac with a trophy Will turned into a weapon. Smith‚Äôs spider army devours him and he is thrown into the time portal, ripping him apart. The planet‚Äôs increasing instability forces the Jupiter II to take off, but they are unable to reach escape velocity and are destroyed by the planet's debris. Realizing his father never actually abandoned them, and that he really does love him, Will sets the time machine to send John back to his family, but there is only enough power for one person. Saying goodbye to his family, the future Will is killed by falling debris, and John reunites with his living family. Realizing they do not have enough power to escape the planet's gravitational pull, John suggests they drive the ship down through the planet, using the gravity well to slingshot them back into space. They are successful, but the planet turns into a black hole, and they activate the hyperdrive to escape.

Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of one and a half out of four, calling it a \\"dim- witted shoot-'em-up\\". Wade Major of BoxOffice rated the film at 1 and a half out of 5, calling it \\"the dumbest and least imaginative adaptation of a television series yet translated to the screen.\\" James Berardinelli was slightly more favorable, giving the film a rating of 2 and a half out of 4. While praising the film's set design, he criticized its \\"meandering storyline and lifeless protagonists,\\" saying that \\"Lost in Space features a few action sequences that generate adrenaline jolts, but this is not an edge-of-the-seat motion picture.\\" Online aggregators have tracked both contemporary and recent reviews of Lost in Space. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 28% based on 83 appraisals, with an average score of 4.7/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Clumsily directed and missing most of the TV series' campy charm, Lost in Space sadly lives down to its title.\\" The film holds a score of 42 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on the opinions of 19 journalists, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Box office On its opening weekend, Lost in Space grossed $20,154,919 and debuted at number one at the box office, ending Titanics 15-week-long hold on the first-place position. It opened in 3,306 theaters and grossed an average of $6,096 per screening. Lost in Space grossed $69,117,629 in the United States, and $67,041,794 outside of America, bringing its worldwide total to $136,159,423. Those results were deemed insufficient to justify a planned sequel. Accolades Lost in Space received six Saturn Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Oldman. The film also received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Remake or Sequel, but lost to the tied Godzilla, The Avengers and Psycho. At the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film won Worst Supporting Actress for Chabert and was nominated for four other awards: Worst Song in a Movie for \\"Lost in Space\\" (lost to \\"Come with Me\\"), Worst Resurrection of a TV Show (lost to The Avengers), Worst Director for Hopkins (lost to Jeremiah Chechik for The Avengers), and Worst Picture (lost to Spice World).

The words of the songs are poems by Friedrich R√ºckert. Text and music Friedrich R√ºckert, as portrayed by Bertha Froriep in 1864 The original were a group of 428 poems written by R√ºckert in 1833‚Äì34Painter (2002, 174) in an outpouring of grief following the illness (scarlet fever) and death of two of his children. Karen Painter describes the poems thus: \\"R√ºckert's 428 poems on the death of children became singular, almost manic documents of the psychological endeavor to cope with such loss. In ever new variations R√ºckert's poems attempt a poetic resuscitation of the children that is punctuated by anguished outbursts. But above all the poems show a quiet acquiescence to fate and to a peaceful world of solace.\\" These poems were not intended for publication, and they appeared in print only in 1871, five years after the poet's death.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512096/Friedrich-Ruckert Mahler selected five of R√ºckert's poems to set as Lieder, which he composed between 1901 and 1904. The songs are written in Mahler's late-romantic idiom, and like the texts reflect a mixture of feelings: anguish, fantasy resuscitation of the children, resignation. The final song ends in a major key and a mood of transcendence. The cello melody in the postlude to \\"\\" (mm. 129‚Äì133) alludes to the first subject of the finale of Mahler's Symphony No. 3 (1895/96), a movement titled \\"What love tells me\\" (\\"\\"). \\"Musically, then, this is the last word of the : that death is powerful, yet love is even stronger.\\"Andreas Dorschel, \\"\\", in: Musikfreunde 25 (2012/13), no. 5, pp. 34‚Äì37. Composition and premiere Hefling indicates that Mahler composed the first, third, and fourth songs in 1901 (he played them for his friend Natalie Bauer-Lechner on 10 August). There followed a long break, and the remaining songs were composed in the summer of 1904. The work was premiered in Vienna on 29 January 1905. Friedrich Weidemann, a leading baritone at the Vienna Court Opera, was the soloist, and the composer conducted. The hall was selected as a relatively small one, compatible with the intimacy of the lied genre, and the orchestra was a chamber orchestra consisting of players drawn from the Vienna Philharmonic.Tunbridge (2010:77)  Scoring and performance  The work is scored for a vocal soloist (the notes lie comfortably for a baritone or mezzo- soprano) and an orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, timpani, glockenspiel, tam-tam, celesta, harp, and strings. There are no trumpets. Deployed at chamber-orchestra scale, this instrumentation permitted Mahler to explore a wide variety of timbres within a smaller-scale sound; Tunbridge sees this as a new precedent adopted by later composers, for example Schoenberg in Pierrot Lunaire. Concerning the performance of the work, the composer wrote \\"these five songs are intended as one inseparate unit, and in performing them their continuity should not be interfered with\\".This instruction is reproduced on page 3 of the piano score (IMC, New York, c.1952). The work takes about 25 minutes to perform. The Kindertotenlieder and Mahler's life history At the time he wrote the work, Mahler was no stranger to the deaths of children. Hefling writes: \\"Such tragedy was familiar to Mahler, eight of his siblings died during their childhood. Among all of them, the death of his closest younger brother Ernst in 1875\\"Chronology of the life of Gustav Mahler\\", Mahleria had affected him most deeply, and he confided to [his friend] Natalie [Bauer-Lechner] that 'such frightful sorrow he had never again experienced, as great a loss he had nevermore borne'.\\"Hefling (2009:218) Mahler resumed the composition of the interrupted work (see above) in 1904, only two weeks after the birth of his own second child; this upset his wife Alma, who \\"found it incomprehensible and feared Mahler was tempting Providence.\\"Hefling (2009:318‚Äì319) Hefling also discusses the possibility that the timing of Mahler's resumption of work was not accidental: \\"Birth and death had been closely paired for Mahler since his infancy.\\" Alma's fears proved all too prescient, for four years after the work had been completed the Mahlers' daughter Maria died of scarlet fever, aged four. Mahler wrote to Guido Adler: \\"I placed myself in the situation that a child of mine had died. When I really lost my daughter, I could not have written these songs any more.\\" Lyrics { \\"Nun will die Sonn' so hell aufgeh'n\\" (D minor) :Nun will die Sonn' so hell aufgeh'n :als sei kein Ungl√ºck die Nacht gescheh'n. :Das Ungl√ºck geschah nur mir allein. :Die Sonne, sie scheinet allgemein. :Du mu√üt nicht die Nacht in dir verschr√§nken :mu√üt sie ins ew'ge Licht versenken. :Ein L√§mplein verlosch in meinem Zelt, :Heil sei dem Freudenlicht der Welt. \\"Nun seh' ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen\\" (C minor) :Nun seh' ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen :ihr spr√ºhtet mir in manchem Augenblicke. :O Augen, gleichsam, um in einem Blicke :zu dr√§ngen eure ganze Macht zusammen. :Doch ahnt' ich nicht, weil Nebel mich umschwammen, :gewoben vom verblendenden Geschicke, :da√ü sich der Strahl bereits zur Heimkehr schicke, :dorthin, von wannen alle Strahlen stammen. :Ihr wolltet mir mit eurem Leuchten sagen: :Wir m√∂chten nah dir immer bleiben gerne!

It was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1997. \\"Buddha Zone\\" is the concept by which a Buddha can appear on Earth using a Buddha statue. The series highlights the adventures of Senju (the Thousand-Hand Avalokite≈õvara Bodhisattva) who has to find and protect Sachi, an incarnation of the Buddha Miroku (Maitreya Bodhisattva). Miroku is said to appear on Earth at a time when the Dharma is no longer taught and is completely forgotten, achieve complete enlightenment and then re-teach the pure dharma, becoming a successor of ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. It is thus Senju's job to aid Miroku (Sachi) in achieving enlightenment, enabling her to achieve Buddha. Plot In 1975, a young orphan girl named Sachi protests against the planned destruction of the temple Saigan (her home) by the Minoura clan, who plans to build a hotel in its place. When one of the gangsters notices the statue of the Thousand-Hand Kannon within the temple, Sachi tells them that she will not allow anything to happen to the statue. In response, the gangsters laugh and threaten her, telling her that there is nothing the statue can do to save her. However, the Thousand-Hand Kannon comes to life, breaking the temple doors and attacking one of the gangsters. The statue shatters into pieces and inside it is a boy who tells them to lay their hands off Sachi, sending fear amongst the gangsters who then flee, vowing revenge. The boy introduces himself as Senju, the Thousand-Hand Kannon. Senju, as an emissary of the buddha Kannon, has appeared in the human world to find and protect the reincarnation of the future Buddha, Miroku. Recognizing Sachi as Miroku, Senju reveals that it is his mission to accompany her to India where she will awaken and achieve enlightenment to save the world from destruction. However, they are inhibited by the Mara, forces that seek to pollute with earthly desires, and Buddha who believe that Senju is not strong enough to protect Sachi from harm. Characters ; :Senju, known as the Thousand-Hand Avalokite≈õvara, is a Bodhisattva sent to protect the incarnation of the bodhisattva Miroku by Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana). He wears garments called a and has an arm ring on his left arm. Because his original statue was made of wood, Senju can float. ; :A young girl who was abandoned by her parents 10 years before the beginning of the story and raised by a poor priest. Sachi is an incarnation of the Buddha Miroku. She is initially suspicious towards Senju, but eventually follows him to avoid being attacked constantly by the envoys of Mara. ; :(The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha) Senju's childhood friend.

His primary attack is the ; he also has the which he used only once in the series. ; :The leader of the Minoura clan, Minoura destroyed Sachi's temple, but was defeated by Senju. He and his clan later become Buddhist monks and help rebuild the temple. The origin of the character name is American comic book artist and writer Mike Mignola. ; :The main antagonist. A former Bodhisattva who went towards Mara. He is the leader of the forces opposing the awakening of Miroku. He was once friends with Senju. ; :A stone statue who originally posed next to a temple, he was rescued by Senju when he was thrown. He followed Senju onto Earth. ; :The Bodhisattva Hayagriva, he was sent to replace Senju when the situation becomes critical. ; :An itako priestess who possesses the ability to summon the dead using her body as a medium and wields the sword Harusame. Found on Mount Osore, she was raised by an elderly itako, whom Anna views as a grandmother. She has a cheerful and indomitable spirit, along with an unscrupulous desire to obtain money in order to travel the world and find her birth parents. Her character later inspired Anna Kyoyama, one of the main characters of Takei's later work, Shaman King. ; :A wood carver and sculptor who created Senju's body.

It is located on the Island of Recife, near the Recife harbor. This historic area has been recently recovered and now holds several clubs, bars and a high-tech center called Porto Digital. History Recife Antigo consists of the initial Portuguese settlement in the 16th century around the port. Sugar cane production from Pernambuco was delivered to Portugal through Recife's port. While Recife had port functions, Olinda was the capital. In 1630, the Dutch invaded Pernambuco, set Olinda partially on fire and Recife became the seat of the Dutch government. Count John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen became Governor-General of the Dutch colony and built a new town on a neighboring island. This city was named Mauritsstadt and the Palacio do Campo das Princesas, seat of the State of Pernambuco government, is built on its ruins. The Dutch were forced out in 1654 of a Recife with good infrastructure, for they had built canals and improved the port and the defenses of it. A flourishing Jewish community lived in Recife under them and they had to leave it because of the Portuguese Inquisition. Thus, a group of 24 Portuguese Jews who had previously migrated from Portugal to the Netherlands because of antisemitism, headed farther North with the Dutch, where New Amsterdam present-day Manhattan was founded. The first Synagogue built in the Americas, the Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, is located in Recife Antigo, on Rua do Bom Jesus, formerly Rua dos Judeus, or Street of the Jews. The Portuguese synagogue was founded in lower Manhattan and it is located on Central Park West in Manhattan nowadays under the name Portuguese & Spanish synagogue.

The company's headquarters are in Vaughan, Ontario, in the Greater Toronto Area.\\"footer_cara_contact_01.gif .\\" Cara Operations. Retrieved on September 13, 2011. \\"Address: 199 Four Valley Drive, Vaughan, ON L4K 0B8\\" In May 2018, CEO Bill Gregson announced that Cara Operations Limited would be changing its name to Recipe Unlimited Corporation.  History  The company was originally chartered in 1883 as Canada Railway News Company, selling newspapers, magazines and confectionaries at railway stations. The company's roots go back to the mid-1850s, when Thomas Patrick Phelan was selling fruit and newspapers to train passengers between Hamilton and Buffalo. Canada Railway News soon moved into the food business, catering to a boom in passenger rail traffic in Canada. In the 1930s, the company began offering catering services to the airlines. By 1951, it was serving about 1,500 meals a day. In 1961, the company changed its name to Cara Operations Limited. The name Cara was derived from the first two letters of each of the words \\"Canada Railway\\". Cara was owned solely by the Phelan family from its inception in 1883 until it went public in 1968. At that time, its primary business was catering to the transportation sector (airline and rail meals), but it did operate a few 'no-name' restaurants and coffee shops in various office towers and airport terminals in Canada. Total sales of all the various operations was C$30 million in 1968. In 1986, Cara provided services for Vancouver's Expo 86. In 2002, sales for the whole company were C$1.9 billion. 88% of the business comes from the restaurant services, with the remaining 12% deriving from airline catering. On February 26, 2004, Cara went private, with the Phelan heiresses buying out the minority for $8 a share or $345 million, after a short battle in which they had offered $7.625 a share for the 46.5% of the company they didn't own. At the time, Cara fully owned Swiss Chalet, Harvey's, Second Cup, Kelsey's Neighborhood Bar & Grill, and Montana's Cookhouse. It owned as a franchisee Eastern Canadian Outback Steakhouse restaurants. In 2006, Don Robinson was appointed President and CEO of Cara. Robinson retired in May 2013. In 2008, the company moved its headquarters from Mississauga, Ontario, to Vaughan, Ontario, near the Vaughan Mills shopping centre.Contact Information.\\" Cara Operations. April 5, 2004. Retrieved on September 13, 2011. \\"Head Office 6303 Airport Road Mississauga, Ontario Canada L4V 1R8\\" At that time, Cara was in the middle of a controversy, when three employees were arrested at the Montreal-Trudeau airport in relation to a drug distribution network that used the planes for which Cara provided the catering. In 2014, Cara had EBITDA of $84 million on sales of $1.7 billion, but had a 6.4 debt leverage ratio when Bill Gregson assumed the presidency of the firm, because the funds obtained via the sale of non-core-asset had been used, not to pay down debt but instead to expand the business. The March 2015, Cara IPO was brokered by Fairfax Holdings. Through it, the company raised $200 million, and merged in a 7:8 ratio with Fairfax's East Side Mario's, Casey's and the Bier Markt properties. The $200 million represented a 23% stake in the combined business, and the heiresses had in 2015 realised a valuation of roughly $300 million. The services of Bill Gregson were acquired in the deal by the merged company. In May 2018, then Chief Executive Officer Bill Gregson announced that Cara Operations Limited would be changing its name to Recipe Unlimited Corporation and would be traded under the new stock symbol \\"RECP\\". On October 1, 2018, the company was hit by a malware attack, requiring closure of many of its restaurants in Canada. The attack required some restaurants to continue as cash-only operations until at least the following day. Some locations were without point-of-sale systems and also without electronic payment methods for almost a week.  Acquisitions  In 1999, Cara purchased Kelseys Inc. from owner Paul Jeffery, acquiring Montanas, Kelseys and the Outback (Canada). The rights to Outback steakhouse were owned in Canada by Cara, but it was sold back to Outback in the USA because of high food costs.:Cara Operations Limited: In 2013, Cara came to an agreement with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. to make Prime Restaurants a wholly owned subsidiary of Cara. This added restaurants such as Casey's, East Side Mario's, Bier Markt and Prime Pubs to its operations. On August 31, 2015, Cara announced that it would be acquiring New York Fries. South St. Burger would not be part of the acquisition. South St. Burger Co. was sold to MTY Food Group instead. On March 31, 2016, Cara Operations announced that it would acquire St-Hubert Chicken in the summer of 2016 for CAD$537 million. On June 1, 2017, Cara Operations completed the acquisition of The Burger's Priest restaurant franchise. This was reported in a July 31, 2017 https://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass;=8&issuerNo;=00036860&issuerType;=03&projectNo;=02655033&docId;=4156296 press release. In January 2018, Cara Operations announced their intention to acquire the 108-location steakhouse chain, The Keg. The $200M deal closed on February 22, 2018. Labour issues Beginning October 5, 2015, female employees at all Bier Markt locations were required to wear tight blue mini- dresses, and heels or boots as footwear on the job. The work outfit practice applied to employees at locations in Ontario and Quebec who had previously worn black pants and golf shirt as a uniform. After the CBC investigated complaints of gender discrimination, Cara modified its outfit practice to allow employees to wear the original gender-neutral uniform. In early 2018, Cara's CEO and President Bill Gregson announced that the recent Ontario minimum wage hike to $14 an hour had not adversely affected revenues, with sales going up throughout most of Ontario.  Operations  Restaurants As of December 2017, Recipe Unlimited had 1,221 restaurants within Canada and 51 additional restaurants that were situated internationally.

Common names in English include wax apple, Java apple, Semarang rose-apple and wax jambu.. This is very common in the Southern India of Kerala where it is commonly known as Jambakka  Description  Syzygium samarangense is a tropical tree growing to tall, with evergreen leaves long and broad. The leaves are elliptic, but rounded at the base; they are aromatic when crushed. The trunk is relatively short, with a wide yet open crown starting low on the tree. The bark is pinkish-gray in color, and flakes readily. The flowers are white to yellowish-white, diameter, with four petals and numerous stamens. They form in panicles of between 3 and 30 near branch tips. The resulting fruit is a bell-shaped, edible berry, with colors ranging from white, pale green, or green to red, purple, or crimson, to deep purple or even black. The fruit grows long in wild plants, and has 4 fleshy calyx lobes at the tip. The skin is thin, and the flesh is white and spongy. Each berry holds 1‚Äì2 rounded seeds not larger than . The flowers and resulting fruit are not limited to the axils of the leaves, and can appear on nearly any point on the surface of the trunk and branches. When mature, the tree is considered a heavy bearer, yielding a crop of up to 700 fruits. When ripe, the fruit will puff outwards, with a slight concavity in the middle of the underside of the \\"bell\\". Healthy wax apples have a light sheen to them. Despite its name, a ripe wax apple only resembles an apple on the outside in color. It does not taste like an apple, and it has neither the fragrance nor the density of an apple. Its flavor is similar to a snow pear, and the liquid- to-flesh ratio of the wax apple is comparable to a watermelon. Unlike either apple or watermelon, the wax apple's flesh has a very loose weave. The very middle holds a seed situated in a sort of cotton-candy-like mesh. This mesh is edible, but flavorless. The color of its juice depends on the cultivar; it may be purple to entirely colorless.  Food  A number of cultivars with larger fruit have been selected. In general, the paler or darker the color, the sweeter it is. In Southeast Asia, the black ones are nicknamed \\"Black Pearl\\" or \\"Black Diamond\\", while the very pale greenish-white ones, called \\"Pearl\\", are among the highest priced ones in fruit markets. The fruit is often served uncut, but with the core removed, to preserve the unique bell-shaped presentation. In the cuisine of Indian Ocean islands, the fruit is frequently used in salads, as well as in lightly saut√©ed dishes. It is mainly eaten as a fruit and also used to make pickles (chambakka achar). In the Philippines, its local name is macopa (its ancient name before colonialism, is 'dambo'). Because of their similarity in appearance, it is often confused with tambis (Syzygium aqueum), although the latter is more commonly cultivated.

If a voting machine does not provide a tangible record of individual votes cast then it can be described as black box voting. Etymology The term, as described by Dr. Arnold Urken of Stevens Institute of Technology, comes from the technical jargon use of the term black box, a device or system or object when it is viewed primarily in terms of its input and output characteristics. Dr. Urken's group at Stevens Institute was one of the first independent testing authorities for voting machines. The term was coined by David Allen, publisher, technical consultant and co-writer to author and activist Bev Harris. Harris popularized the term in her book with that title and runs the BlackBoxVoting.org website. Allen's formal definition is found on page 4 of the original edition of the book: \\"Any voting system in which the mechanisms for recording and/or tabulating the vote are hidden from the voter, and/or the mechanism lacks a tangible record of the vote cast.\\"Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century Black box voting systems Both optical scan systems which interpret paper ballots and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) systems can be black box systems; in fact, mechanical voting machines can also be seen as black-box systems, since only the technicians who set up the machines have access to the linkages between the voting levers on the face of the machine and the vote recording counters inside. Rhode Island supreme court justice Horatio Rogers, in an 1897 dissenting opinion, wrote of one early mechanical voting machine that : ... a voter on this voting machine has no knowledge, through his senses that he has accomplished a result. The most that can be said is, if the machine worked as intended, then he has made his holes and voted. It does not seem to me that this is enough.Horation Rogers, Dissenting Opinion, In re Voting Machine, Atlantic Reporter, Vol. 36, West, St. Paul, 1897; page 717 (19 R.I. 1729 (1897)) Rogers' criterion for whether a voting machine is a black box is strict‚Äîyou must be able to sense that it works correctly as you use it. A somewhat weaker criterion is sometimes accepted, based on whether the public is allowed to examine the mechanism, in a modern context, both the source code and hardware. Though source code may be available to voting system testing authorities and state or county election officials it can still be considered \\"black box\\" if it is not available to the public. Even with some open source systems, which allow examination of the source code, access to firmware, which controls the hardware, is not available. Even if the source code is made public, significant challenges remain in the areas of authenticating that the code running systems in the field matches the publicly released code, and it is still possible to find attack vectors for open source systems. In the U.S. presidential election, 2004, 32% of the voting was done on optical scan machines and 29% on DRE voting machinesNew Study Shows 50 Million Voters Will Use Electronic Voting Systems, 32 Million Still with Punch Cards in 2004, Election Data Services Inc. using trade secret proprietary software.

History When Shane Lacy Hensley decided to create a 19th-century miniatures game he contacted Charles Ryan's company Chameleon Eclectic about publishing it. The result was Fields of Honor (1994), published in conjunction with Chameleon Eclectic, who dealt with distribution and other things that Hensley was not ready for, but ownership of the game remained with a new company that Hensley had created called Pinnacle Entertainment Group. The next year, Pinnacle and Chameleon Eclectic published The Last Crusade (1995), John Hopler's World War II CCG, the last product produced jointly between the two companies. When he completed the first draft of the game Deadlands, Hensley flew in two friends and game designers, Greg Gorden and Matt Forbeck, who liked what they saw and asked to buy into the company; although Gordon later had to leave for personal reasons, Forbeck moved to Blacksburg, Virginia to help Pinnacle get going. Deadlands: The Weird West (1996) was shortly thereafter published as Pinnacle's first RPG and its first independent publication. Description Pinnacle Entertainment Group is owned and operated by Shane Lacy Hensley and was founded in 1994. Some time before 2003, the company was renamed Great White Games and in 2005 returned to the original name. In 1996 the company published what would be their flagship title for several years Deadlands,HENSLEY Shane Lacy, Deadlands: The Weird West Roleplaying Game, Pinnacle Entertainment Group, August 1996, 224 p. soft cov., a role-playing game set in an alternate-history U.S. of the 1870s. Deadlands features magic and horror amidst the tropes of the Old West. Later that year they would also publish Brave New World, a dystopian superhero role-playing game that used a simplified version of the Deadlands rules. A second major line was introduced in 2001 called Weird Wars and features horror elements combined with a historical war setting. The first entrant in the Weird Wars line is Weird War II: Blood on the Rhine and uses the d20 System under the Open Gaming License from Wizards of the Coast. A second entry, Tour of Darkness, set during the Vietnam War, was released in 2004 using the Savage Worlds system. In 2003, as Great White Games, they produced Savage Worlds, a game designed to be both a role-playing game and a miniatures game. A highly streamlined, generic system, it is designed to provide game play in any genre. Subsequent releases for Savage Worlds are self-contained campaigns designed to minimize the preparation time of the GM and maximize the time spent running the game with players. Savage Worlds carries the tag line \\"Fast! Furious! Fun!\\" to emphasize the streamlining and quick play inherent in the system. In late 2005, Shane Hensley announced that Great White Games would return to using the Pinnacle Entertainment Group moniker as its brand name for subsequent releases.

Early breeders introduced a Siamese type Russian Blue into their breeding. However, using current genetic testing, it is believed that almost none remain in the gene pool. It has been documented that self-brown cats were shown in Europe in the 1890s, one name given to these was the Swiss Mountain Cat. These disappeared until post-World War II, with the most likely explanation that the Siamese Cat Club of Britain discouraged their breeding.Havana Brown 1998 Article The Swiss Mountain Cat was never used in the breeding programs of the modern Havana Brown. However, they likely share genetics inherited from the Siamese.  Breed development  In the early 1950s a group of English cat fanciers began working together with an intent to create a self brown cat of Foreign Type. They called themselves \\"The Havana Group\\", later to become \\"The Chestnut Brown Group\\". This group of breeders created the foundation of the Havana Brown cat of today. The ladies credited with this effort include Mrs. Armitage Hargreaves of Laurentide Cattery, Mrs. Munroe-Smith of Elmtower Cattery, the Baroness Von Ullmann of Roofspringer Cattery, Mrs. Elsie Fisher of Praha Cattery, and Mrs. Judd of Crossways Cattery. These breeders, by selectively breeding a Siamese cat which carried the chocolate gene to a black cat that also carried the chocolate gene, were able to produce chestnut (chocolate) colored kittens. The breed continued to develop in the UK and became known as the Chestnut Brown Oriental and retained the Siamese conformation. Early in the breeding program, two kittens were also exported to Siamese breeders in the USA. Over the next decade, breeding took a different turn as genetic problems began to plague the new breed. It became necessary to utilize other breeds for genetic outcross and the phenotype began to evolve and develop into a different look than what the original breeders in England had intended. This change in direction tore apart the breeding group and caused many difficulties in continuing to progress the breed within the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy. Soon, the Chestnut Brown cat was being produced in many colors, known just as Oriental with a numeric system to designate the coat color. In the US, the imported kittens continued to be crossbred with the Chocolate and Seal Point Siamese, producing only Chocolate or pointed offspring, with the breeders selectively breeding for only self brown kittens. Genetic diversity quickly resolved any defects that were seen in the early imports. The breeders in the US desired to maintain the look of the cats that were imported and bred specifically for brown offspring. Thus, the cats in the United States have a different look than the cats being bred in England. The American breeders focused on maintaining the unique head shape and did not breed for extremes. This American bred version was moderate in every way, with a rich, warm mahogany color that consistently produced like offspring. In 1964, the Havana Brown was accepted for Championship status in the world's largest feline registry, The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA). Early this century, a group of breeders in England again began trying to recreate the vision of the early Havana breeders. They made good progress in isolating the chocolate genetics and were consistently producing chocolate, lilac and pointed kittens. In 2011 a registered Havana Brown was imported from Europe and bred back to their Havana orientals. This cats contribution, along with selective breeding for type, began to direct the look of some English Havanas away from its Oriental siblings, and moved them more in the direction of the Havana Brown. In June 2014 under the breed name Suffolk, this cat gained recognition by the GCCF. The alternative name was used because the GCCF uses the name Havana to refer to a self chocolate Oriental Shorthair, from which they wished to be distinguished. Although a Havana Brown is used in the breeding program of the Suffolk, they are not to be confused as the same breed. The Suffolk is much closer to the Chestnut/Havana Oriental than to the Havana Brown.  Features and behavior  The Havana Brown is a well balanced, moderately sized, muscular short-haired cat with a body of average length. Sterilized animals can tend to become larger and somewhat chubby. They are a moderately active breed, compared to other short-hair cat breeds. The coat color must be warm brown, typically reddish-brown, with no obvious tabby markings (note that kittens will always show markings but they resolve as the cat ages and dissolve completely by one year). Whiskers must also be brown and the eye color green. The head should be slightly longer than wide, but should never appear like a wedge. In profile, the nose/muzzle should have a distinct stop and change in direction at the eyes. Paw pads must be pink or rose colored but should never be black. Ears tend to be moderately large. A Havana Brown should have no extreme features; specimens should be attractive and moderate. Males tend to be larger than females and are average in weight compared with other breeds. The Havana Brown is an intelligent cat that often uses its paws both to examine objects and to communicate with its owners. Curiosity brings them to the door as visitors arrive rather than preferring to be hidden as many cats will do. It is not unheard of for a Havana Brown to place paws on someone's thigh and offer a meow of introduction. It is playful and curious, but rarely destructive unless left without companionship. While many are 'lap cats', a few are more content just to sit quietly beside their human companions. On the other hand, many Havana Browns prefer to ride on the shoulders of their human and help with daily activities. They love to play in and groom hair - it happens so frequently that there are Havana Brown owners who don't even notice their cat doing it until it is pointed out by an observer. It is an odd trait that most Havana Browns share. Havana Browns become very attached to their family and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. They are curious and interactive and need to be a part of daily activities. It is common for the Havana Brown to become best companions with the family dog. Many owners also find it surprising how easily they can travel with their Havana Brown without the cat's objection. The most likely explanation of the breed's name - and the one most shared by Havana Brown devotees - is that its coat color is very similar to that of the Havana cigars, however, some have also argued that the breed's name is also derived from the Havana (rabbit) which also shares the color. This is likely more accurate based on the recorded history in England. Very little grooming is required. A gentle brushing and wipe with a damp cloth once or twice a week, along with a good quality diet, will suffice for Havana Browns. There are no known genetic diseases associated with this breed. They may have a slightly higher occurrence of gingivitis than other breeds, this being contributed to their Siamese ancestry.  Recognition  The breed has been recognized for competition in the US since the late 1950s. It has been considered an endangered breed, since the breeding pool is very small. In the late 1990s, there were only 12 Cat Fanciers' Association-registered Havana Brown catteries and under 130 unaltered cats. Since that time, the breed has grown at a healthy pace. In 2015 there are now twice the number of catteries and breeders located around the world, with the majority located in the US and Europe.

Stouffville is bounded by farmland and a golf course. The community is located on the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Rouge River watershed. Transportation GO Transit's Stouffville line passes through the community with commuter trains stopping at the Stouffville GO Station in the downtown core and terminating at Lincolnville GO Station. When no trains are scheduled a bus service from Toronto serves the town with some runs continuing to Uxbridge. York Region Transit's bus#15 travels around the community of Stouffville and along the Stouffville Road to Yonge Street in Richmond Hill, and their bus#9 (9th line) travels from the town to Markham Stouffville Hospital and thence to Box Grove Plaza.

Buckley, Jr. Early life Oakes was born in 1925. He served in World War II as a fighter pilot and graduated from Yale University. Oakes is an engineer by training (at one point in the series, he is hired by an architectural firm), and Anthony Trust, ahead of Black at both Greyburn and Yale, recruits him for the Central Intelligence Agency in his senior year, 1951. At Yale, Blackford is older than most of his classmates due to his military service. Reference is made to his membership on both the swimming and lacrosse teams there, and he is a member of Zeta Psi fraternity. Sally Partridge, a Vassar graduate, is his main love interest throughout the series. Their fateful meeting and Blackford's courtship of Sally is detailed in Mongoose, R.I.P. Central Intelligence Agency Blackford's missions with the CIA involve various top-secret Cold War enterprises arranged by the Agency's highest ranking individuals and American presidents alike. Oakes possesses the ability to impress his colleagues, superiors (among them John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan), and even his enemies with his easy-going competence and likability. Personal life Oakes' personal life is somewhat hectic because of his constant globetrotting for the Agency, as he can never seem to find ample time to settle down with Sally, who yearns for the day when Blackford will retire from the CIA. Their respective worldviews are quite dissimilar, Oakes being conservative, and Sally, a liberal feminist who studied and teaches Jane Austen and admires Adlai Stevenson. While not only disliking Blackford's chosen profession because it so often spoils their plans, Sally also disapproves of many of the ideals she believes the CIA represents. While always holding Sally close to his heart, Oakes still finds plenty of time to pursue romantic conquests across the globe, often mixing work with pleasure. He is a suave, intelligent, and confident gentleman who is, in Buckley's own words, distinctly American, and it is no surprise he succeeds in both work and play. In \\"Saving the Queen,\\" Blackford's address in 1975 is listed as 3025 P Street, NW. Blackford is an avid reader of National Review but rarely offers insight into the state of domestic politics and world affairs. Characteristics Throughout the series, Blackford proves himself to be the ultimate Cold War warrior, and risks his life for the country he loves countless times, while looking smooth doing it. Though Oakes is widely regarded as a gentleman, and at times, a charmer, he also has a rebellious streak in the face of unduly harsh authority. Blackford demonstrates this rebelliousness throughout the series, beginning with an incident involving the administration of Greyburn Academy, which Blackford briefly attends as a schoolboy.

It overlooks a farming community, known as The Holland Marsh, located on the Holland River that flows into Lake Simcoe. History The eastern boundary of Bradford is the Holland River, named for Samuel Holland, first Surveyor General of British North America, who passed this way on an exploration from Toronto to Balsam Lake, by way of Lake Simcoe, in 1791. For several years the Holland River and Lake Simcoe provided the only means of transportation. Holland Landing was the northern terminus of Yonge Street. The military route to Georgian Bay during the War of 1812 crossed Lake Simcoe to Kempenfelt Bay, then by the Nine Mile Portage to Willow Creek and the Nottawasaga River. The Penetanguishene Road, built between 1814 and 1815 from Kempenfelt Bay, provided an alternate route to Georgian Bay. However, early settlers also used this route to get to the frontier of Simcoe County, bypassing the areas of West Gwillimbury and Essa townships. The first settlers to cross the Holland River, arriving in the fall of 1819, were three Irishmen: James Wallace, Lewis Algeo and Robert Armstrong. This was about the same time as the Auld Kirk Scotch Settlement was established. However, the pioneers of West Gwillimbury were mostly Protestants from Northern Ireland. The new settlers sent a petition to the province of Upper Canada early in 1824, stating they were separated from the settlements of Yonge Street, by an impassable swamp. On January 24 the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada made a grant for the first main road in West Gwillimbury (4 Geo. 1V., chap 29). The contract for the first corduroy road across the Holland Marsh was completed by Robert Armstrong and his sons in the fall of 1825. Connecting with other contactors sections and the previously constructed road from Kempenfelt Bay, the road became known as Penetanguishene Road. It later became part of Yonge Street, and is now Simcoe County Road 4. The original road (Bridge Street) did not curve onto Holland Street, but continued straight to what is now Scanlon Ave. near Colborne Street; from there the road continued north, while another road led southwest to the Scottish settlement. It was at this junction that the settlement was first established. William Milloy, formerly of Coulson's Corners, built a small log tavern there in the fall of 1829. Other businessmen included James Drury, merchant; James Campbell, shoemaker and Thomas Driffel, blacksmith. John Peacock, an old soldier from London, England, had settled as a merchant and became the first postmaster in 1835. Name Initially, the place was known as Milloy's Tavern and later was called Edmanson's Corners. In 1840, Joel Flesher Robinson named it after his home town in West Yorkshire, England. Bradford becomes a town Bradford was incorporated as a village in 1857, with a population of about 1,000 people. Only a few years prior to this, the Northern Railway of Canada was built through the town. The train station was constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway and later used by the CNR. Bradford was incorporated as a town in 1960. The Downtown Core has survived two fires. The first, on May 23, 1871, destroyed upwards of one hundred homes including all of the business part of the village except two hotels being consumed. However, a new downtown area arose where most buildings were made of brick. Today many of the buildings still exist and make up the downtown core. The second fire was in the 1960s with damage only to the northwest corner of the intersection at Highway 11 and Highway 88. One of its famous historical landmarks that still operates to this day is the Village Inn Hotel. Its architect was E. J. Lennox, one of Toronto's foremost architects who also built Toronto's Old City Hall, the West Wing of the Ontario Legislative Building (known as Queen's Park), and the King Edward Hotel. The Village Inn is situated at the crossroads of Highway 88 and Highway 11, and is the landmark at the four corners of Bradford. Food, lodgings, and hospitality serve as its trademark. This history goes back to the 1900s, to horse and buggy days, when the Village Inn was a favourite meeting place for local residents and travellers en route for other parts of the country. The building survived a couple of fires including the great downtown fire of 1957. In 1980, it was hit by a crane that was trying to negotiate the intersection. It has since been extensively remodeled. Early industry The village of Bradford was established to supply the agricultural interests of its surrounding area, and for a brief period in the mid-19th century, lumbering was a major industry, as trees had to be removed in order to commence farming. In 1824 entrepreneurs John Thorpe and Mark Scanlon obtained a government grant for the construction of a grist mill on a stream north of the settlement; although the partnership was dissolved about 1832, Scanlon built two sawmills in that vicinity. Water power being the only means of motive power at the time, as many as six mills were located on Scanlon Creek at one time. The family of Thomas Maconchy, one of the early settlers of Gilford, built a sawmill in Bradford at the bridge over the Holland River, in 1840. It was the first mill at that location. When the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway was constructed, it was said to be through an almost continuous forest for most of the distance from Toronto to Barrie. Sometime after the line opened, Toronto lumber merchant Thompson Smith put up a large sawmill on the river near the Bradford station. First evidence of Smith in the village was 1862 when his partner James Durham cut the Holland River bridge in two, while driving logs to the mill. Thompson Smith's mill was the second largest in the area, next to the Sage mill at Bell Ewart. Smith added a second mill at Bradford, as well as contracting with Durham's mill in Barrie. Only a decade after the arrival of the railway at Lake Simcoe, pine for the mills was running low. In 1867 H. W. Sage persuaded Thompson Smith to join with him in the formation of the Rama Timber Transport Company, to supply Lake Simcoe mills with timber. With logs coming from as distant as Head Lake, Smith put up a third mill, south of the Holland River bridge in 1869. Following an example set by American lumberman Henry W. Sage, Thompson Smith established a number of mills at Cheboygan, Michigan. Bradford farmland - Primarily carrot crops In 1923, William Henry Day began the drainage system that turned the wetlands of the Holland Marsh into arable land, which now consists of thousands of acres where fresh vegetables are grown.

Rd. 88) in Bradford on a Saturday afternoon. Bradford's downtown core is situated at the intersection of former Highway 11 (now, County Road 4) and 88 (now, County Road 88). County Road 88 intersects with Ontario's Highway 400, a limited-interchange multi-lane major thoroughfare that connects to Toronto in the south and \\"cottage country\\" in the north. This portion of Highway 11 is one of the few connecting routes between Highway 404 to the east and the 400 to the west, creating considerable through traffic. It can be tough to drive through the town on long weekends. The town's local transit services consist of 2 bus routes, which are operated by the town's local bus service, BWG Transit. GO Transit has bus routes that connect the town to Barrie and Newmarket, and Bradford also has a station on GO Transit's commuter train network. The GO Train service had its first inaugural run through Bradford in 1982. At the time, the commuter train went as far north as Barrie. Over the years the service to Barrie was stopped. This caused Bradford to be a terminus for the commuter trains to Toronto. However, the City of Barrie purchased the rail line north of Bradford with the hope of reintroducing rail service to Barrie. GO Train service resumed as of December 2007 to the city of Barrie.New GO Stations Further reading \\"A History of Simcoe County,\\" (1909) by Andrew F Hunter 1863-1940.

Pender Island is approximately in area and is home to about 2,250 permanent residents, as well as a large seasonal population. Like most of the rest of the Southern Gulf Islands, Pender Island enjoys a sub-Mediterranean climate and features open farmland, rolling forested hills, several lakes and small mountains, as well as many coves and beaches. Geography Pender Island consists of two islands, North Pender and South Pender, which are separated by a narrow canal originally dredged in 1903. In 1955 the islands were connected by a one lane bridge, as it remains today. Most of the population and services reside on North Pender Island, with the highest concentration surrounding Magic Lake.Google Map of Pender Island showing Magic Lake subdivision History At the time of European Contact, Pender Island was inhabited by Coast Salish peoples speaking the North Straits Salish language. There is an Indian reserve at Hay Point on South Pender Island, which is home to members of the Tsawout and Tseycum First Nations. Carbon dating of artifacts in shell middens near Belden Cove identify an Indian village site that has been more or less continuously inhabited for five millennia.Roy L. Carlson and Philip M.

The islands, along with Pender Harbour on the Sunshine Coast, were given their current name by Captain Richards for Staff Commander, later Captain, Daniel Pender, RN who surveyed the coast of British Columbia aboard , and from 1857 to 1870. The first permanent resident of European descent arrived on South Pender Island in 1886.A Gulf Islands Patchwork (B.C. Historical Association, 1961), page 35. In 1903, residents of Pender Island petitioned the government to dredge the isthmus between what is now North and South Pender Islands. Culture Pender Island is a popular destination for fishing, boating, scuba diving and other outdoor pursuits. The island also boasts a 9-hole golf course. In 1937 several Pender residents put up money to purchase a parcel, on which to develop the course, from George Grimmer, a son of Pender pioneer Washington Grimmer. These first individuals and many others took out memberships as well as planned and developed the layout of the golf course. Incorporated as a society in 1945, with the exception of a brief hiatus during World War II, Pender Island Golf Course has existed ever since. There is also a 27-hole Disc Golf course (Golf Island Disc ParkGolf Islands Disc Park Website) close to Magic Lake. This course is well known in the Disc Golf community and is the site of many tournaments including The Republic of Pender Invitational (The Ropi) and the Pender Island Invitational.

Parks and beaches * Gulf Islands National Park Reserve has opportunities for boating, kayaking, hiking, camping and wildlife viewing. A difficult trail at Beaumont leads from the Ainslie Point parking lot to the shoreline via steep switchbacks that cut through dense temperate rainforest. The difficult trail at Mt. Norman ascends to a panoramic look-out with views of the San Juan Islands. The moderate trail at Roe Lake meanders through the Shingle Bay uplands to one of the Southern Gulf Island's few freshwater lakes.http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn- np/bc/gulf/visit/brochures.aspxhttp://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/bc/gulf/carte-map- nfl.aspx#a25 At Roesland, visitors can explore a historic 1908 farmhouse which has been restored by members of the Pender Islands Museum Society.Welcome The Pender Islands Museum Camping * Gulf Islands National Park Reserve has two options for campers: the drive-in, frontcountry sites at Prior Centennial Campground or the walk-in (or boat-in) backcountry sites at Beaumont. Prior Centennial has 17 reservable sites and amenities include potable water, pit toilets, picnic tables and fire pits (seasonally available). Beaumont has 11 sites, and amenities include pit toilets and 15 mooring buoys for boaters. There is no potable water at Beaumont and no campfires are permitted, regardless of season. * Private camping is available at Port Browning Marina. The sites are drive-in and frontcountry. Tents can be pitched anywhere on the large waterfront lawn of the marina. Transport North Pender Island from the ferry Pender Island can be accessed by regular ferry service provided by BC Ferries from Swartz Bay (near Victoria), Tsawwassen (near Vancouver), and other southern Gulf Islands. There are also scheduled seaplane and water taxi services. There is also a system of \\"car stops,\\" Pender Island's official alternative to hitch hiking. Conveniently located around the island you will find posts with maps, and often a handy chair. A community bus also began servicing the island in 2016. Pender Island also has a helicopter pad located near the main shopping mall, the Driftwood Centre. Select helicopters can also land at Fire Hall #1. Bedwell Harbour is an official port of entry for sailors from the United States; Port Browning and Otter Bay also offer anchorages.

G. Wodehouse. In the first novel in which he appears, he is an \\"amateur dictator\\" and the leader of a fictional fascist group in London called the Saviours of Britain, also known as the Black Shorts. He leaves the group after he inherits his title. He has a low opinion of Jeeves's employer Bertie Wooster, whom he looks on as a thief. A large and intimidating figure, Spode is protective of Madeline Bassett to an extreme degree and is a threat to anyone who appears to have wronged her, particularly Gussie Fink-Nottle. Life and character Spode is a friend of Sir Watkyn Bassett, being the nephew of Sir Watkyn's fianc√©e Mrs. Wintergreen in The Code of the Woosters, though she is not mentioned again.Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 282. He is intensively protective of Sir Watkyn's daughter, Madeline Bassett, having loved her for many years without telling her. A violent man, he threatens to tear Bertie's head off and make him eat it. Spode is a large and intimidating figure, with a powerful, square face.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 226‚Äì227. When he first sees Spode, Bertie describes him: > About seven feet in height, and swathed in a plaid ulster which made him > look about six feet across, he caught the eye and arrested it. It was as if > Nature had intended to make a gorilla, and had changed its mind at the last > moment.Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 1, p. 20. In Bertie's eyes, Spode starts at seven feet tall, and seems to grow in height, eventually becoming nine feet seven. Bertie immediately thinks of Spode as \\"the Dictator\\" even before he learns of Spode's political ambitions. As Bertie says, \\"I don't know if you have even seen those pictures in the papers of Dictators with tilted chins and blazing eyes, inflaming the populace with fiery words on the occasion of the opening of a new skittle alley, but that was what he reminded me of.\\" Bertie learns how accurate his initial impression of Spode was when Gussie tells him that Spode is the leader of a fascist group called the Saviours of Britain, also known as the Black Shorts. Gussie says of Spode, \\"His general idea, if he doesn't get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 3, p. 66. Like Bertie, Spode had been educated at Oxford; during his time there, he once stole a policeman's helmet.Wodehouse (2011) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 3, p. 42. While the leader of the Black Shorts, he is also secretly a designer of ladies' underclothing, being the proprietor of Eulalie Soeurs of Bond Street. Bertie's Aunt Dahlia is a customer at Eulalie Soeurs and remarks that the shop is very popular and successful.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 15, p. 150. Spode later inherits a title on the death of his uncle, becoming the seventh Earl of Sidcup. After being elevated to the peerage, he sells Eulalie Soeurs.Garrison (1991), p. 179. At some point, he leaves the Black Shorts. Bertie says in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves that before Spode succeeded to his title, he had been \\"one of those Dictators who were fairly common at one time in the metropolis\\", but \\"he gave it up when he became Lord Sidcup\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1963], Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, chapter 18, pp. 152‚Äì153. Despite Spode becoming Lord Sidcup, Bertie usually thinks of him as Spode, at one point addressing him as \\"Lord Spodecup\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 73. In The Code of the Woosters, most of which takes place at Sir Watkyn's country house, Totleigh Towers, Spode is the leader of the Black Shorts. He quickly starts to think of Bertie as a thief, believing that Bertie was trying to steal Sir Watkyn's umbrella and also the silver cow- creamer from a shop. Spode threatens to beat Bertie to a jelly if he steals the cow-creamer from Sir Watkyn. Spode also antagonizes Gussie, for two reasons. First, Spode thinks Gussie is not devoted enough to Madeline, who is engaged to Gussie. Second, Gussie has insulted Spode in a notebook, writing that Spode's mustache was \\"like the faint discoloured smear left by a squashed blackbeetle on the side of a kitchen sink\\", and that the way Spode eats asparagus \\"alters one's whole conception of Man as Nature's last word.\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 11, p. 234. With help from Jeeves and the Junior Ganymede club book, Bertie learns the word \\"Eulalie\\", and tells Spode that he knows all about it. Spode, who does not want his followers to learn about his career as a designer of ladies' lingerie, is forced not to bother Bertie or Gussie. Spode is also blackmailed into taking the blame for the theft of Constable Oates's helmet. Bertie does not learn the true meaning of \\"Eulalie\\" until the end of the story.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 104‚Äì111. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, which takes place at Aunt Dahlia's country house, Brinkley Court, Spode has recently become Lord Sidcup. Bertie and his Aunt Dahlia plan to blackmail Spode with knowledge of \\"Eulalie\\" to keep Spode, who is a jewellery expert, from revealing that Aunt Dahlia's pearl necklace is a fake (she pawned the real one to raise money for her magazine, Milady's Boudoir). However, the blackmail plan is unsuccessful, because, as Spode tells Aunt Dahlia, he has sold Eulalie Soeurs. Aunt Dahlia ends up using a cosh she found on the ground to knock out Spode, which allows her to retrieve her fake necklace from a safe in order to hide it so it cannot be appraised. Later in the story, Spode identifies a different pearl necklace, one belonging to the Liverpudlian socialite Mrs. Trotter, as fake.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 128‚Äì134. In Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, which takes place at Totleigh Towers, Spode is as protective of Madeline as ever and threatens to break Bertie's neck when he thinks that he has caused Madeline to cry (she was shedding a tear because she thought Bertie was lovesick and could not stay away from her). Spode, seeing Gussie kiss Emerald Stoker, threatens to break Gussie's neck as well and calls him a libertine. Harold Pinker steps forward to protect Gussie, and after Spode hits Pinker on the nose, Pinker, an expert boxer, knocks him out. Spode soon wakes up, but is knocked out again, by Emerald. Gussie leaves Madeline for Emerald, and Spode proposes to Madeline. She says that she must marry Bertie to reward his love for her, but Spode and Jeeves convince her that Bertie came to Totleigh to steal Sir Watkyn Bassett's black amber statuette, not out of love for her. Madeline accepts Spode's proposal.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 138‚Äì143. In Much Obliged, Jeeves, which takes place at Brinkley Court, Spode has been invited by Bertie's Aunt Dahlia to Brinkley for his skills as an orator. He gives speeches in support of the Conservative candidate for Market Snodsbury, Harold \\"Ginger\\" Winship. As Spode's fianc√©e, Madeline goes with him. After the success of his speeches, Spode considers standing for election himself for the House of Commons, which would require him to relinquish his title. Madeline, who wanted to gain the title Lady Sidcup, breaks their engagement, and says she will marry Bertie instead. After being hit by a potato at a lively candidate debate, Spode changes his mind about standing for Parliament and decides to retain his title, leading to a reconciliation between him and Madeline. They are still engaged at the end of the novel.Cawthorne (2013), pp. 143‚Äì147. It is noteworthy that though Spode regularly threatens to harm others, he is generally the one who gets injured. In The Code of the Woosters, when Spode advances to attack Gussie, Gussie manages to hit him on the head with an oil painting. Spode's head goes through the painting, and while he is briefly stunned, Bertie envelops him in a sheet. Bertie then hits Spode with a vase, but gets grabbed by Spode; Bertie frees himself by burning Spode with a cigarette.Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 7, pp. 144‚Äì147. In other novels, Spode is knocked out three times: he is hit with a cosh by Bertie's Aunt Dahlia in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, he is punched by Harold Pinker in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, and Emerald Stoker smashes a china basin on his head in the same book. He is also hit in the eye with a potato at a candidate debate in Much Obliged, Jeeves.Usborne (2003), p. 120. Appearances Spode is featured in: * The Code of the Woosters (1938) * Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954) * Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves (1963) * Much Obliged, Jeeves (1971) Spode is mentioned in: * Aunts Aren't Gentlemen (1974) (ch. 7 and 15) The Black Shorts The flag of the British Union of Fascists. The Saviours of Britain, nicknamed the Black Shorts, is a fictional fascist group led by Roderick Spode. Spode is modelled after Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists (1932‚Äì1940), who were nicknamed the Blackshirts. In The Code of the Woosters, Spode is an \\"amateur dictator\\" who leads a farcical group of fascists called the Saviours of Britain, better known as the Black Shorts. Spode adopted black shorts as a uniform because, as Gussie Fink-Nottle says, \\"by the time Spode formed his association, there were no shirts left\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 3, p. 67. This alludes to various radical groups: Mussolini's Blackshirts, Hitler's Brownshirts, the French Blueshirts and Greenshirts, the Irish Blueshirts and Greenshirts, the South African Greyshirts, Mexico's Gold shirts, and the American Silver Shirts. When Bertie Wooster rebukes Spode in The Code of the Woosters (1938), he mocks Spode's black shorts, calling them \\"footer bags\\" (football shorts): > \\"It is about time\\", I proceeded, \\"that some public-spirited person came > along and told you where you got off. The trouble with you, Spode, is that > just because you have succeeded in inducing a handful of half-wits to > disfigure the London scene by going about in black shorts, you think you're > someone. You hear them shouting 'Heil, Spode!' and you imagine it is the > Voice of the People. That is where you make your bloomer. What the Voice of > the People is saying is: 'Look at that frightful ass Spode swanking about in > footer bags! Did you ever in your puff see such a perfect > perisher?'\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 7, p. > 143. Like Mosley, Spode inherited a title upon the death of a relative; unlike Mosley, who inherited his baronetcy in 1928 (which entitled him to be called Sir) before forming his fascist group, Spode did not inherit his earldom (which made him Lord Sidcup) until after forming his group. Spode leaves the Black Shorts after gaining his title. In the television series Endeavour (series five episode four ‚Äì \\"Colours\\"), there is a reference to \\"Spode and Webley\\" being shot as fascists. (Webley is another fictional fascist leader, from Aldous Huxley's Point Counter Point, and unlike Spode does end up being assassinated.) Adaptations Television The flag of the Black Shorts in the Jeeves and Wooster television series. * In the 1990‚Äì1993 television series Jeeves and Wooster, Spode was portrayed by John Turner.Taves (2006), pp. 189‚Äì198. In this series, Spode is depicted as having an appearance somewhat similar to Mussolini as the leader of the Black Shorts. The Black Shorts are portrayed as a tiny group of around a dozen men and teenage boys dressed in uniforms like those of the Sturmabteilung. They also have the same flag colour scheme as the National Socialists. Their flag is similar in design to the flag of the British Union of Fascists (which used the party's symbol, the Flash and Circle). Members of the Black Shorts comprise the small, enthusiastic audience to whom Spode makes loud, dramatic Hitler-like speeches in which he announces bizarre statements of policy, such as giving each citizen at birth a British-made bicycle and umbrella. He also makes multiple statements revolving around root vegetables. In the original stories, none of Spode's speeches are depicted and no other members of his group make an appearance. In the television series only, Spode has a secret recorded in the Junior Ganymede club book involving a kangaroo named Celia. Stage * In the 1975 musical Jeeves, Spode was portrayed by John Turner, who also played Spode in the television series Jeeves and Wooster. Unlike in the novels, Spode is referred to as Sir Roderick Spode in the musical. The character was dropped from the 1996 rewrite titled By Jeeves, in which the closest equivalent character is Cyrus Budge III Jnr, who is original to the musical. * In the 2013 play Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense, in which the events of The Code of the Woosters are reenacted by Bertie, Jeeves, and Aunt Dahlia's butler Seppings, Spode is portrayed by Seppings. Radio * In the 1973‚Äì1981 radio drama series What Ho! Jeeves, Spode was voiced by James Villiers (The Code of the Woosters) and Paul Eddington (Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves). Spode is mentioned in the What Ho, Jeeves! adaptation of Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit but does not have a speaking role. His actions are described by other characters. * In the 1997 L.A. Theatre Works radio adaptation of The Code of the Woosters, Spode was voiced by Martin Jarvis. Jarvis also voiced Jeeves in the same production, which was recorded live before an audience. * In BBC Radio 4's 2006 adaptation of The Code of the Woosters for its Classic Serial series, Spode was voiced by Jack Klaff. * Adam Godley voiced Spode in the 2018 BBC radio adaptation of Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves.

'frosting' 3.a is a sweet, often creamy glaze made of sugar with a liquid, such as water or milk, that is often enriched with ingredients like butter, egg whites, cream cheese, or flavorings. It is used to coat or decorate baked goods, such as cakes. When it is used between layers of cake it is known as a filling. Icing can be formed into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a pastry bag. Such decorations are commonplace on birthday and wedding cakes. Edible dyes can be added to icing mixtures to achieve a desired hue, usually this is usually to do with connotations of added ingredients. Sprinkles, edible inks or other decorations are often used on top of icing. A basic icing is called a glac√©, containing powdered sugar (also known as icing sugar or confectioners' sugar) and water. This can be flavored and colored as desired, for example, by using lemon juice in place of the water. More complex icings can be made by beating fat into powdered sugar (as in buttercream), by melting fat and sugar together, by using egg whites (as in royal icing), by whipping butter into meringue (as in Italian or Swiss meringue buttercream), and by adding other ingredients such as glycerin (as in fondant). Some icings can be made from combinations of sugar and cream cheese or sour cream, or by using ground almonds (as in marzipan). Icing can be applied with a utensil such as a knife or spatula, or it can be applied by drizzling or dipping (see glaze), or by rolling the icing out and draping it over the cake. The method of application largely depends on the type and texture of icing being used. Icing may be used between layers in a cake as a filling, or it may be used to completely or partially cover the outside of a cake or other baked product. History Covering cakes with powdered sugar or other materials was introduced in the 17th century. The icing was applied to the cake then hardened in the oven. The earliest attestation of the verb 'to ice' in this sense seems to date from around 1600,Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, 2012, s.v. and the noun 'icing' from 1683.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, 2012, s.v.

He was most famous for his ellipsoid algorithm (1979) for linear programming, which was the first such algorithm known to have a polynomial running time. Even though this algorithm was shown to be impractical due to the high degree of the polynomial in its running time, it has inspired other randomized algorithms for convex programming and is considered a significant theoretical breakthrough. Early life and education Khachiyan was born on May 3, 1952 in Leningrad to Armenian parents Genrikh Borisovich Khachiyan, a mathematician and professor of theoretical mechanics, and Zhanna Saakovna Khachiyan, a civil engineer. His grandparents were Karabakh Armenians. He had two brothers: Boris and Yevgeniy (Eugene). His family moved to Moscow in 1961, when he was nine. He received a master's degree from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1978 he earned his Ph.D. in computational mathematics/theoretical mathematics from the Computer Center of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and in 1984 a D.Sc. in computer science from the same institution. Career Khachiyan began his career at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, working as a researcher at the Academy's Computer Center in Moscow. He also worked as an adjunct professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1979 he stated: \\"I am a theoretical mathematician and I'm just working on a class of very difficult mathematical problems.\\" Khachiyan immigrated to the United States in 1989.

The paper was translated into several languages and spread around the world unusually fast. Authors of a 1981 survey of his work noted that it \\"has caused great excitement and stimulated a flood of technical papers\\" and was covered by major newspapers. It was originally published without proofs, which were provided by Khachiyan in a later paper published in 1980Khachiyan, L. G. 1980. \\"Polynomial Algorithms in Linear Programming\\". Zhurnal Vychisditel'noi Matematiki i Matematicheskoi Fiziki (USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics) 20, 51-68. and by Peter G√°cs and Laszlo Lov√°sz in 1981. It were G√°cs and Lov√°sz who first brought attention to Khachiyan's paper at the International Symposium on Mathematical Programming in Montreal in August 1979. It was further popularized when Gina Kolata reported it in Science Magazine on November 2, 1979. Khachiyan's theory is considered a groundbreaking one that \\"helped advance the field of linear programming.\\" Giorgio Ausiello noted that the method was not practical, \\"but it was a real breakthrough for the world of operations research and computer science, since it proved that the design of polynomial time algorithms for linear programming was possible and in fact opened the way to other, more practical, algorithms that were designed in the following years.\\" Personal life and death Khachiyan spoke Russian and English, but not Armenian. Bahman Kalantari noted that \\"For some, his English accent wasn‚Äôt always easy to understand.\\" The 1979 New York Times profile of him described Khachiyan as \\"a relaxed, friendly young man in a sweater who speaks a little English, which he learned in high school.\\" He was known as \\"Leo\\" and \\"Lenya\\" to his friends and colleagues. V√°clav Chv√°tal described him as \\"selfless, open, patient, sympathetic, understanding, considerate.\\" Michael Todd, another colleague, described him as \\"cynical about politics,\\" \\"very modest and kind to his friends,\\" and \\"intolerant of condescension and pomposity.\\" Khachiyan married Olga Pischikova Reynberg, of Russian Jewish origin, in 1985. They had two daughters, Anna and Nina, who were teenagers at the time of his death. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000. He died of a heart attack in South Brunswick, New Jersey on April 29, 2005, at the age of 52. Recognition In 1982 he was awarded the prestigious Fulkerson Prize by the Mathematical Programming Society and the American Mathematical Society for outstanding papers in the area of discrete mathematics, particularly his 1979 article \\"A polynomial algorithm in linear programming.\\" Khachiyan was considered a \\"noted expert in computer science whose work helped computers process extremely complex problems.\\" He was called one of the world's most famous computer scientists at the time of his death by Haym Hirsh, chair of the computer science department at Rutgers. \\"Computer scientists and mathematicians say his work helped revolutionize his field,\\" noted his New York Times obituary.

The world premiere was staged at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 9 July 1991, directed by Lindsay Posner. It had one reading and one workshop production prior to its world premiere.  Characters  * Paulina Salas ‚Äî 38 years old * Gerardo Escobar ‚Äî her husband, a lawyer, around forty-five * Roberto Miranda ‚Äî a doctor, around fifty The time is the present and the place, a country that is probably Chile but could be any country that has given itself a democratic government just after a long period of dictatorship.  Synopsis  Paulina Salas is a former political prisoner in an unnamed Latin American country who had been raped by her captors, led by a sadistic doctor whose face she never saw. The rapist doctor played Schubert's String Quartet No. 14, subtitled Death and the Maiden, during the act of rape; hence the play's title. Years later, after the (also unnamed) repressive regime has fallen, Paulina lives in an isolated country house with her husband, Gerardo Escobar. When Gerardo comes back from a visit to the president, he gets a flat tire. A stranger named Dr. Miranda stops to assist him. Dr. Miranda drives Gerardo home and later in the night he returns. Paulina recognizes Miranda's voice and mannerism as that of her rapist, and takes him captive in order to put him on trial and extract a confession from him. Unconvinced of his guilt, Gerardo acts as Roberto Miranda's lawyer and attempts to save his life. After hearing the full story of her captivity from Paulina, Gerardo formulates a confession with Roberto to appease Paulina's madness and set her free from her past. Paulina records the entire confession and has Roberto write it out and sign it. She sends Gerardo out to get Roberto's car so he can go home. While they are alone for the last time, Paulina accuses Roberto of being unrepentant and guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Throughout the play it is uncertain whether details are evidence of Roberto's guilt or Paulina's paranoia. At the end of the play it is unclear who is innocent.  Productions  Death and the Maiden had a reading at the Institute for Contemporary Art in London on 30 November 1990: * Paulina ‚Äî Penelope Wilton * Gerardo ‚Äî Michael Maloney * Roberto ‚Äî Jonathan Hyde * Directed by Peter James A workshop production was staged and opened in Santiago, Chile, on 10 March 1991: * Paulina ‚Äî Maria Elena Duvauchelle * Gerardo ‚Äî Hugo Medina * Roberto ‚Äî Tito Bustamante * Directed by Ana Reeves Death and the Maiden had its world premiere at The Royal Court Upstairs on 9 July 1991: * Paulina ‚Äî Juliet Stevenson * Gerardo ‚Äî Bill Paterson * Roberto ‚Äî Michael Byrne * Directed by Lindsay Posner With the same cast and director, it transferred to the Mainstage at The Royal Court on 4 November 1991. The American Broadway premiere of Death and the Maiden opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on 17 March 1992, produced by Roger Berlind, Gladys Nederlander and Frederick Zollo, in association with Thom Mount and Bonnie Timmermann: * Paulina ‚Äî Glenn Close * Gerardo ‚Äî Richard Dreyfuss * Roberto ‚Äî Gene Hackman * Directed by Mike Nichols The Australian premiere production of Death and the Maiden took place on 16 December 1992. * Paulina ‚Äì Helen Morse * Gerardo ‚Äì John Gaden * Roberto ‚Äì Frank Gallacher * Directed by Neil Armfield The Indian premiere of Death and the Maiden (in Hindi translation by Shalini Vatsa) opened at the India Habitat Centre New Delhi on 17 February 2002, produced by Asmita Theatre.

Many luxury goods are often considered status symbols. Status symbol is also a sociological term ‚Äì as part of social and sociological symbolic interactionism ‚Äì relating to how individuals and groups interact and interpret various cultural symbols.The Three Sociological Paradigms, from The HCC-Southwest College , December 2008.  By region and time  Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the inquilino in picture. Image from 19th century rural Chile As people aspire to high status, they often seek also its symbols. As with other symbols, status symbols may change in value or meaning over time, and will differ among countries and cultural regions, based on their economy and technology. Military symbol of excellence Galero hat, symbol of ecclesiastical status For example, before the invention of the printing press, possession of a large collection of laboriously hand-copied books was a symbol of wealth and scholarship. In later centuries, books (and literacy) became more common, so a private library became less-rarefied as a status symbol, though a sizable collection still commands respect. In some past cultures of East Asia, pearls and jade were major status symbols, reserved exclusively for royalty. Similar legal exclusions applied to the toga and its variants in ancient Rome, and to cotton in the Aztec Empire. Special colors, such as imperial yellow (in China) or royal purple (in ancient Rome) were reserved for royalty, with severe penalties for unauthorized display. Another common status symbol of the European medieval past was heraldry, a display of one's family name and history. Societal recognition Status symbols also indicate the cultural values of a society or a subculture. For example, in a commercial society, having money or wealth and things that can be bought by wealth, such as cars, houses, or fine clothing, are considered status symbols. Where warriors are respected, a scar can represent honor or courage. Among intellectuals being able to think in an intelligent and educated way is an important status symbol regardless of material possessions. In academic circles, a long list of publications and a securely tenured position at a prestigious university or research institute are a mark of high status. It has been speculated that the earliest foods to be domesticated were luxury feast foods used to cement one's place as a \\"rich person\\".Hayden B 2003. Were luxury foods the first domesticates? Ethnoarchaeological perspectives from Southeast Asia. World Archaeology 34(3) A uniform symbolizes membership in an organization, and may display additional insignia of rank, specialty, tenure and other details of the wearer's status within the organization. A state may confer decorations, medals or badges that can show that the wearer has heroic or official status. Elaborate color-coded academic regalia is often worn during commencement ceremonies, indicating academic rank and specialty. In many cultures around the world, diverse visual markers of marital status are widely used. Coming of age rituals and other rites of passage may involve granting and display of symbols of a new status. Dress codes may specify who ought to wear particular kinds or styles of clothing, and when and where specific items of clothing are displayed.  Body modifications  The condition and appearance of one's body can be a status symbol. In times past, when most workers did physical labor outdoors under the sun and often had little food, being pale and fat was a status symbol, indicating wealth and prosperity (through having more than enough food and not having to do manual labor). Now that workers usually do less-physical work indoors and find little time for exercise, being tanned and thin is often a status symbol in modern cultures. Dieting to reduce excess body fat is widely practiced in Western society, while some traditional societies still value obesity as a sign of prosperity. Development of muscles through exercise, previously disdained as a stigma of doing heavy manual labor, is now valued as a sign of personal achievement. Some groups, such as extreme bodybuilders and sumo wrestlers use special exercise and diet to \\"bulk up\\" into an impressive appearance. Warrior tattoos Ancient Central American Maya cultures artificially induced crosseyedness and flattened the foreheads of high-born infants as a permanent, lifetime sign of noble status. The Mayans also filed their teeth to sharp points to look fierce, or inset precious stones into their teeth as decoration.  Material possessions  Hunting trophy of an aristocrat Luxury goods are often perceived as status symbols. Examples may include a mansion or penthouse apartment, a trophy spouse, haute couture fashionable clothes, jewellery, or a luxury vehicle. A sizeable collection of high-priced artworks or antiques may be displayed, sometimes in multiple seasonally occupied residences located around the world. Privately owned aircraft and luxury yachts are movable status symbols that can be taken from one glamorous location to another; the \\"jet set\\" refers to wealthy individuals who travel by private jet and who frequent fashionable resorts.Merriam-Webster. Jet set. Accessed 2013-10-02. Personal library of a wealthy American, 1919 Status symbols are also used by persons of much more modest means. In the Soviet Union before the fall of the Berlin Wall, possession of American-style blue jeans or rock music recordings (even pirated or bootlegged copies) was an important status symbol among rebellious teenagers. In the 1990s, foreign cigarettes in China, where a pack of Marlboro could cost one day's salary for some workers, were seen as a status symbol.J Brooks.

Nonetheless Apple products such as iPod or iPhone are common status symbols among modern teenagers. A common type of modern status symbol is a prestigious luxury branded item, whether apparel or other type of a good. The brand name or logo is often prominently displayed, or featured as a graphic design element of decoration.

It is defined by light, and begins at the depth where only 1% of incident light reaches and ends where there is no light; the depths of this zone are between approximately 200 to 1000 meters (~660 to 3300 feet) below the ocean surface. It hosts a diverse biological community that includes bristlemouths, blobfish, bioluminescent jellyfish, giant squid, and a myriad of other unique organisms adapted to live in a low-light environment. It has long captivated the imagination of scientists, artists and writers; deep sea creatures are prominent in popular culture, particularly as horror movie villains. Physical conditions Pelagic zones The mesopelagic zone includes the region of sharp changes in temperature, salinity and density called the thermocline, halocline, and pycnocline. The temperature variations are large; from over 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F) at the upper layers to around 4 ¬∞C (39 ¬∞F) at the boundary with the bathyal zone. The variation in salinity is smaller, typically between 34.5 and 35 psu. The density ranges from 1023 to 1027 g/kg of seawater. These changes in temperature, salinity, and density induce stratification which create ocean layers. These different water masses affect gradients and mixing of nutrients and dissolved gasses. This makes this a dynamic zone. The mesopelagic zone has some unique acoustic features. The Sound Fixing and Ranging (SOFAR) channel, where sound travels the slowest due to salinity and temperature variations, is located at the base of the mesopelagic zone at about 600-1200m. It is a wave- guided zone where sound waves refract within the layer and propagate long distances. The channel got its name during World War II when the US Navy proposed using it as a life saving tool. Shipwreck survivors could drop a small explosive timed to explode in the SOFAR channel and then listening stations could determine the position of the life raft. During the 1950s, the US Navy tried to use this zone to detect Soviet submarines by creating an array of hydrophones called the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS.) Oceanographers later used this underwater surveillance system to figure out the speed and direction of deep ocean currents by dropping SOFAR floats that could be detected with the SOSUS array. The mesopelagic zone is important for water mass formation, such as mode water. Mode water is a water mass that is typically defined by its vertically mixed properties. It often forms as deep mixed layers at the depth of the thermocline. The mode water in the mesopelagic has residency times on decadal or century scales. The longer overturning times contrast with the daily and shorter scales that a variety of animals move vertically through the zone and sinking of various debris.  Biogeochemistry   Carbon  The mesopelagic zone plays a key role in the ocean's biological pump, which contributes to the oceanic carbon cycle. In the biological pump, organic carbon is produced in the surface euphotic zone where light promotes photosynthesis. A fraction of this production is exported out of the surface mixed layer and into the mesopelagic zone. One pathway for carbon export from the euphotic layer is through sinking of particles, which can be accelerated through repackaging of organic matter in zooplankton fecal pellets, ballasted particles, and aggregates. In the mesopelagic zone, the biological pump is key to carbon cycling, as this zone is largely dominated by remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC). When a fraction of POC is exported from the euphotic zone, an estimated 90% of that POC is respired in the mesopelagic zone. This is due to the microbial organisms that respire organic matter and remineralize the nutrients, while mesopelagic fish also package organic matter into quick-sinking parcels for deeper export. Another key process occurring in this zone is the diel vertical migration of certain species, which move between the euphotic zone and mesopelagic zone and actively transport particulate organic matter to the deep. In one study in the Equatorial Pacific, myctophids in the mesopelagic zone were estimated to actively transport 15-28% of the passive POC sinking to the deep, while a study near the Canary Islands estimated 53% of vertical carbon flux was due to active transport from a combination of zooplankton and micronekton. When primary productivity is high, the contribution of active transport by vertical migration has been estimated to be comparable to sinking particle export. Sediment trap sample, Thermaikos Gulf, Greece, 2000. Stereoscopic image of the collected material above 63-Œºm pore size net. Calcareous shells and skeletons of planktonic organisms can be identified.  Particle Packaging and sinking  Mean particle sinking rates are 10 to 100 m/day. Sinking rates have been measured in the project VERTIGO (Vertical Transport in the Global Ocean) using settling velocity sediment traps. The variability in sinking rates is due to differences in ballast, water temperature, food web structure and the types of phyto and zooplankton in different areas of the ocean. If the material sinks faster, then it gets respired less by bacteria, transporting more carbon from the surface layer to the deep ocean. Larger fecal pellets sink faster due to gravity. More viscous waters could slow the sinking rate of particles.  Oxygen  Dissolved oxygen is a requirement for aerobic respiration, and while the surface ocean is usually oxygen-rich due to atmospheric gas exchange and photosynthesis, the mesopelagic zone is not in direct contact with the atmosphere, due to stratification at the base of the surface mixed layer. Organic matter is exported to the mesopelagic zone from the overlying euphotic layer, while the minimal light in the mesopelagic zone limits photosynthesis. The oxygen consumption due to respiration of most of the sinking organic matter and lack of gas exchange, often creates an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the mesopelagic. The mesopelagic OMZ is particularly severe in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean due to poor ventilation and high rates of organic carbon export to the mesopelagic. Oxygen concentrations in the mesopelagic are occasionally result in suboxic concentrations, making aerobic respiration difficult for organisms. In these anoxic regions, chemosynthesis may occur in which CO2 and reduced compounds such as sulfide or ammonia are taken up to form organic carbon, contributing to the organic carbon reservoir in the mesopelagic. This pathway of carbon fixation has been estimated to be comparable in rate to the contribution by heterotrophic production in this ocean realm.  Nitrogen  The mesopelagic zone, an area of significant respiration and remineralization of organic particles, is generally nutrient-rich. This is in contrast to the overlying euphotic zone, which is often nutrient-limited. Areas of low oxygen such as OMZ's are a key area of denitrification by prokaryotes, a heterotrophic pathways in which nitrate is converted into nitrogen gas, resutlng in a loss to the ocean reservoir of reactive nitrogen. At the suboxic interface that occurs at the edge of the OMZ, nitrite and ammonium can be coupled to produce nitrogen gas through anammox, also removing nitrogen from the biologically available pool.  Biology  Sonar data. The green layer in the water column is the deep scattering layer of diel vertically migrating mesopelagic zooplankton and fish. Illustration by Charles Frederick Holder of various bioluminescent fish that live in the mesopelagic zone Although some light penetrates the mesopelagic zone, it is insufficient for photosynthesis. The biological community of the mesopelagic zone has adapted to a low-light, low-food. This is a very efficient ecosystem with many organisms recycling the organic matter sinking from the epipelagic zone resulting in very little organic carbon making it to deeper ocean waters. The general types of life forms found are daytime-visiting herbivores, detritivores feeding on dead organisms and fecal pellets, and carnivores feeding on those detritivores. Many organisms in the mesopelagic zone move up into the epipelagic zone at night, and retreat to the mesopelagic zone during the day, which is known as diel vertical migration. These migrators can therefore avoid visual predators during the day and feed at night, while some of their predators also migrate up at night to follow the prey. There is so much biomass in this migration that sonar operators in World War II would regularly misinterpret the signal returned by this thick layer of plankton as a false sea floor.  Virus and microbial ecology  Very little is known about the microbial community of the mesopelagic zone because it is a difficult part of the ocean to study. Recent work using DNA from seawater samples emphasized the importance of viruses and microbes role in recycling organic matter from the surface ocean, known as the microbial loop. These many microbes can get their energy from different metabolic pathways. Some are autotrophs, heterotrophs, and a 2006 study even discovered chemoautotrophs. This chemoautotrophic Archaea crenarchaeon Candidatus can oxidize ammonium as their energy source without oxygen, which could significantly impact the nitrogen and carbon cycles. One study estimates these ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, which are only 5% of the microbial population, can annually capture 1.1 Gt of organic carbon. Microbial biomass and diversity typically decline exponentially with depth in the mesopelagic zone, tracking the general decline of food from above. The community composition varies with depths in the mesopelagic as different organisms are evolved for varying light conditions. Microbial biomass in the mesopelagic is greater at higher latitudes and decreases towards the tropics, which is likely linked to the differing productivity levels in the surface waters. Viruses however are very abundant in the mesopelagic, with around 1010 \\\\- 1012 every cubic meter, which is fairly uniform throughout the mesopelagic zone.Periphylla periphylla  Zooplankton ecology  The mesopelagic zone hosts a diverse zooplankton community. Common zooplankton include copepods, krill, jellyfish, siphonophores, larvaceans, cephalopods, and pteropods. Food is generally scarce in the mesopelagic, so predators have to be efficient in capturing food. Gelatinous organisms are thought to play an important role in the ecology of the mesopelagic and are common predators. Though previously thought to be passive predators just drifting through the water column, jellyfish could be more active predators. One study found that the helmet jellyfish Periphylla periphylla exhibit social behavior and can find each other at depth and form groups. Such behavior was previously attributed to mating, but scientists speculate this could be a feeding strategy to allow a group of jellyfish to hunt together.Deep sea mysid, Gnathophausia spp.Mesopelagic zooplankton have unique adaptations for the low light. Bioluminescence is a very common strategy in many zooplankton. This light production is thought to function as a form of communication between conspecifics, prey attraction, prey deterrence, and/or reproduction strategy. Another common adaption are enhanced light organs, or eyes, which is common in krill and shrimp, so they can take advantage of the limited light. Some octopus and krill even have tubular eyes that look upwards in the water column. Most life processes, like growth rates and reproductive rates, are slower in the mesopelagic. Metabolic activity has been shown to decrease with increasing depth and decreasing temperature in colder-water environments. For example, the mesopelagic shrimp- like mysid, Gnathophausia ingens, lives for 6.4 to 8 years, while similar benthic shrimp only live for 2 years.  Fish ecology  Mesopelagic fish have a global distribution, with exceptions in the Arctic Ocean. The mesopelagic is home to a significant portion of the world's total fish biomass; one study estimated mesopelagic fish could be 95% of the total fish biomass. Another estimate puts mesopelagic fish biomass at 1 billion tons. This ocean realm could contain the largest fishery in the world and there is active development for this zone to become a commercial fishery. Myctophids (lanternfish) There are currently thirty families of known mesopelagic fish. One dominant fish in the mesopelagic zone are lanternfish (Myctophidae), which include 245 species distributed among 33 different genera. They have prominent photophores along their ventral side. The Gonostomatidae, or bristlemouth, are also common mesopelagic fish. The bristlemouth could be the Earth's most abundant vertebrate, with numbers in the hundreds of trillions to quadrillions. Mesopelagic fish are difficult to study due to their unique anatomy. Many of these fish have swim bladders to help them control their buoyancy, which makes them hard to sample because those gas-filled chambers typically burst as the fish come up in nets and the fish die. Scientists in California have made progress on mesopelagic fish sampling by developing a submersible chamber that can keep fish alive on the way up to the surface under a controlled atmosphere and pressure. A passive method to estimate mesopelagic fish abundance is by echosounding to locate the 'deep scattering layer' through the backscatter received from these acoustic sounders. Some areas have shown a recent decline in abundance of mesopelagic fish, including in Southern California over a long-term study dating back to the 1970s. Cold water species were especially vulnerable to decline. Tasselled anglerfish (Rhycherus filamentosus) Mesopelagic fish are adapted to a low-light environment. Many fish are black or red, because these colors appear dark due to the limited light penetration at depth. Some fish have rows of photophores, small light-producing organs, on their underside to mimic the surrounding environment. Other fish have mirrored bodies which are angled to reflect the surrounding ocean low-light colors and protect the fish from being seen, while another adaptation is countershading where fish have light colors on the ventral side and dark colors on the dorsal side. Food is often limited and patchy in the mesopelagic, leading to dietary adaptions. Common adaptations fish may have include sensitive eyes and huge jaws for enhanced and opportunistic feeding. Fish are also generally small to reduce the energy requirement for growth and muscle formation. Other feeding adaptations include jaws that can unhinge, elastic throats, and massive, long teeth. Some predators develop bioluminescent lures, like the tasselled anglerfish, which can attract prey, while others respond to pressure or chemical cues instead of relying on vision.  Human Impacts   Pollution   Marine Debris  Plastic pellets are a common form of marine debris Marine debris, specifically in the plastic form, have been found in every ocean basin and have a wide range of impacts on the marine world. One of the most critical issues is ingestion of plastic debris, specifically microplastics. Many mesopelagic fish species migrate to the surface waters to feast on their main prey species, zooplankton and phytoplankton, which are mixed with microplastics in the surface waters. Additionally, research has shown that even zooplankton are consuming the microplastics themselves. Mesopelagic fish play a key role in energy dynamics, meaning they provide food to a number of predators including birds, larger fish and marine mammals. The concentration of these plastics has the potential to increase, so more economically important species could become contaminated as well. Concentration of plastic debris in mesopelagic populations can vary depending on geographic location and the concentration of marine debris located there. In 2018, approximately 73% of approximately 200 fish sampled in the North Atlantic had consumed plastic.  Bioaccumulation  Bioaccumulation (a buildup of a certain substance in the adipose tissue) and biomagnification (the process in which the concentration of the substance grows higher as you rise through the food chain) are growing issues in the mesopelagic zone. Mercury in fish, which can be traced back to a combination of anthropological factors (such as coal mining) in addition to natural factors. Mercury is a particularly important bioaccumulation contaminant because its concentration in the mesopelagic zone is increasing faster than in surface waters. Inorganic mercury occurs in anthropogenic atmospheric emissions in its gaseous elemental form, which then oxidizes and can be deposited in the ocean. Once there, the oxidized form can be converted to methylmercury, which is its organic form. Research suggests that current levels anthropogenic emissions will not equilibrate between the atmosphere and ocean for a period of decades to centuries, which means we can expect current mercury concentrations in the ocean to keep rising. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin, and poses health risks to the whole food web, beyond the mesopelagic species that consume it. Many of the mesopelagic species, such as myctophids, that make their diel vertical migration to the surface waters, can transfer the neurotoxin when they are consumed by pelagic fish, birds and mammals.  Fishing  Fishmeal Powder Historically, there have been few examples of efforts to commercialize the mesopelagic zone due to low economic value, technical feasibility and environmental impacts. While the biomass may be abundant, fish species at depth are generally smaller in size and slower to reproduce. Fishing with large trawl nets poses threats to a high percentage of bycatch as well as potential impacts to the carbon cycling processes. Additionally, ships trying to reach productive mesopelagic regions requires fairly long journeys offshore. In 1977, a Soviet fishery opened but closed less than 20 years later due to low commercial profits, while a South African purse seine fishery closed in the mid-1980s due to processing difficulties from the high oil content of fish. As the biomass in the mesopelagic is so abundant, there has been an increased interest to determine whether these populations could be of economic use in sectors other than direct human consumption. For example, it has been suggested that the high abundance of fish in this zone could potentially satisfy a demand for fishmeal and nutraceuticals. With a growing global population, the demand for fishmeal in support of a growing aquaculture industry is high. There is potential for an economically viable harvest. For example, 5 billion tons of mesopelagic biomass could result in the production of circa 1.25 billion tons of food for human consumption. Additionally, the demand for nutraceuticals is also rapidly growing, stemming from the popular human consumption of Omega-3 Fatty Acids in addition to the aquaculture industry that requires a specific marine oil for feed material. Lanternfish are of much interest to the aquaculture market, as they are especially high in fatty acids.  Climate Change  The mesopelagic region plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, as it is the area where most of the surface organic matter is respired. Mesopelagic species also acquire carbon during their diel vertical migration to feed in surface waters, and they transport that carbon to the deep sea when they die. It is estimated that the mesopelagic cycles between 5 and 12 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year, and until recently, this estimate was not included in many climate models. It is difficult to quantify the effects of climate change on the mesopelagic zone as a whole, as climate change does not have uniform impacts geographically. Research suggests that in warming waters, as long as there are adequate nutrients and food for fish, then mesopelagic biomass could actually increase due to higher trophic efficiency and increased temperature-driven metabolism. However, because ocean warming will not be uniform throughout the global mesopelagic zone, it is predicted that some areas may actually decrease in fish biomass, while others increase. Water column stratification will also likely increase with ocean warming and climate change. Increased ocean stratification reduces the introduction of nutrients from the deep ocean into the euphotic zone resulting in decreases in both net primary production and sinking particulate matter. Additional research suggests shifts in the geographical range of many species could also occur with warming, with many of them shifting poleward. The combination of these factors could potentially mean that as global ocean basins continue to warm, there could be areas in the mesopelagic that increase in biodiversity and species richness, while declines in other areas, especially moving farther from the equator.  Research and Exploration  The science ROV 'Hercules' (IFE/URI/NOAA) during a launch in 2005. Note the array of sampling devices and robotic arms that are used to conduct deep-sea research. There is a dearth of knowledge about the mesopelagic zone so researchers have begun to develop new technology to explore and sample this area. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), NASA, and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research are all working on projects to gain a better understanding of this zone in the ocean and its influence on the global carbon cycle. Traditional sampling methods like nets have proved to be inadequate because they scare off creatures due to the pressure wave formed by the towed net and the light produced by the bioluminescent species caught in the net. Mesopelagic activity was first investigated by use of sonar because the return bounces off of plankton and fish in the water. However, there are many challenges with acoustic survey methods and previous research has estimated errors in measured amounts of biomass of up to three orders of magnitude. This is due to inaccurate incorporation of depth, species size distribution, and acoustic properties of the species. Norway's Institute of Marine Research has launched a research vessel named Dr. Fridtjof Nansen to investigate mesopelagic activity using sonar with their focus being on the sustainability of fishing operations. To overcome the challenges faced with acoustic sampling, WHOI is developing remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and robots (Deep- See, Mesobot, and Snowclops) that are capable of studying this zone more precisely in a dedicated effort called the Ocean Twilight Zone project that launched in August 2018.  Discovery and Detection  The deep scattering layer often characterizes the mesopelagic due to the high amount of biomass that exists in the region. Acoustic sound sent into the ocean bounces off particles and organisms in the water column and return a strong signal. The region was initially discovered by American researchers during World War II in 1942 during anti-submarine research with sonar. Sonar at the time could not penetrate below this depth due to the large number of creatures obstructing sound waves. It is uncommon to detect deep scattering layers below 1000m. Until recently, sonar has been the predominate method for studying the mesopelagic. The Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition was a Spanish-led scientific quest in 2011 to gain a better understanding of the state of the ocean and the diversity in the deep oceans. The data collected, particularly through sonar observations showed that the biomass estimation in the mesopelagic was lower than previously thought.  Deep-See  WHOI is currently working on a project to characterize and document the mesopelagic ecosystem. They have developed a device named Deep-See weighing approximately 700 kg, which is designed to be towed behind a research vessel. The Deep-See is capable of reaching depths up to 2000 m and can estimate the amount of biomass and biodiversity in this mesopelagic ecosystem. Deep-See is equipped with cameras, sonars, sensors, water sample collection devices, and a real- time data transmission system.  Mesobot  WHOI is collaborating with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Stanford University, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley to develop a small autonomous robot, Mesobot, weighing approximately 75 kg. Mesobot is equipped with high- definition cameras to track and record mesopelagic species on their daily migration over extended periods of time. The robot's thrusters were designed so that they do not disturb the life in the mesopelagic that it is observing. Traditional sample collection devices fail to preserve organisms captured in the mesopelagic due to the large pressure change associated with surfacing. The mesobot also has a unique sampling mechanism that is capable of keeping the organisms alive during their ascent. The first sea trial of this device is expected to be in 2019.  MINIONS Another mesopelagic robot developed by WHOI are the MINIONS. This device descends down the water column and takes images of the amount and size distribution of marine snow at various depths. These tiny particles are a food source for other organisms so it is important to monitor the different levels of marine snow to characterize the carbon cycling processes between the surface ocean and the mesopelagic.  SPLAT cam  The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute has developed the Spatial PLankton Analysis Technique (SPLAT) to identify and map distribution patterns of bioluminescent plankton. The various bioluminescent species produce a unique flash that allows the SPLAT to distinguish each specie's flash characteristic and then map their 3-dimensional distribution patterns. Its intended use was not for investigating the mesopelagic zone, although it is capable of tracking movement patterns of bioluminescent species during their vertical migrations. It would be interesting to apply this mapping technique in the mesopelagic to obtain more information about the diurnal vertical migrations that occur in this zone of the ocean.

The phrase is a retrospective label; the musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other, and came from a variety of backgrounds and styles, but together they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes. Definition According to the Allmusic guide: Most musicians classified as proto-punk are rock performers of the 1960s and early-1970s, with garage rock/art rock bands the Velvet Underground, MC5 and the Stooges considered to be archetypal proto-punk artists, along with glam rock band the New York Dolls.  Origins and etymology  One of the earliest written uses of the term \\"punk rock\\" was by critic Dave Marsh who used it in 1970 to describe US group Question Mark & the Mysterians, who had scored a major hit with their song \\"96 Tears\\" in 1966. Many US bands were active in the mid-to-late 1960s playing garage rock: a ragged, highly energetic, often amateurish style of rock. While garage bands varied in style, the label of garage punk has been attributed by critic Michael Hann to the \\"toughest, angriest garage rockers\\" such as the 13th Floor Elevators and the Sonics. AllMusic states that bands like the Sonics and the Monks \\"anticipated\\" punk; the latter have likewise been cited as examples of proto-punk and the Sonics' 1965 debut album Here Are the Sonics as \\"an early template for punk rock\\". The raw sound and outsider attitude of psychedelic garage bands like the Seeds also presaged the style of bands that would become known as the archetypal figures of proto-punk. One of the earliest examples of protopunk is \\"She Lied\\" (1964) by the Rockin' Ramrods, which features a sneering chorus and guitar downstroking nearly ten years before it became popular in punk. In parallel, in 1964 garage band Los Saicos appeared in Lima, Peru, considered as one of the first Spanish-American groups that can be classified as protopunk. One of their key songs is \\"Demolici√≥n\\", released as a single in 1965. Debut albums by two key US proto- punk bands were released in 1969; Detroit, Michigan's MC5 released Kick Out the Jams in January, and the Stooges, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, premiered with their self-titled album in August. The latter album was produced by John Cale, a former member of New York's the Velvet Underground; having earned a \\"reputation as the first underground rock band\\", the Velvet Underground inspired, directly or indirectly, many of those involved in the creation of punk rock. Michigan, USA was also the birthplace of bands the Dogs, the Punks and Death, the latter a pioneering but commercially unsuccessful African- American proto-punk group. International developments In the early 1970s, the UK underground counter-cultural scene centred on Ladbroke Grove in west London spawned a number of bands that have been considered proto-punk, including Hawkwind, the Pink Fairies and Third World War; contemporaries Crushed Butler have been called \\"Britain's first proto-punk band.\\" According to Allmusic, glam rock also \\"inspired many future punks with its simple, crunchy guitar riffs, its outrageous sense of style, and its artists' willingness to sing with British accents (not to mention the idiosyncratic images of David Bowie and Roxy Music)\\". With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central elements, that were later picked up by punk acts. Glam group The Hollywood Brats have likewise been cited as \\"proto-punk\\" and \\"Britain's answer to the New York Dolls.\\" The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving conceptually in the direction that would become identified with punk. Bands in London's pub rock scene anticipated punk by stripping the music back to its basics, playing hard, R&B-influenced; rock 'n' roll; by 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would play a role in the punk explosion. Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would two years later adopt the name Joe Strummer and form punk band The Clash. Bands anticipating the forthcoming movement were appearing as far afield as D√ºsseldorf, West Germany, where \\"punk before punk\\" band NEU! formed in 1971, building on the krautrock tradition of groups such as Can. Simply Saucer formed in Hamilton, Canada in 1973 and have been called \\"Canada's first proto-punk band\\", blending garage rock, krautrock, psychedelia and other influences to produce a sound that was later described as having a \\"frequent punk snarl.\\" In Japan, the anti-establishment Zun≈ç Keisatsu (Brain Police) mixed garage, psych and folk; the band's first two albums were withdrawn from public sale after their lyrics were found to violate industry regulations, and their \\"spirit.. was taken up again by the punk movement.\\"Anderson, Mark. \\"Zuno keisatsu\\" in Buckley, Sandra (ed.)The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture. Taylor & Francis, 2009, p588 A new generation of Australian garage rock bands, inspired mainly by the Stooges and MC5, came even closer to the sound that would soon be called \\"punk\\": in Brisbane, the Saints (formed in 1973 but renamed in 1974) recalled the raw live sound of the British Pretty Things, who had made a notorious tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1965, while in Sydney, Radio Birdman, co-founded by Detroit expatriate Deniz Tek in 1974, began playing gigs to a small but fanatical following. The Saints are regarded as a punk band and as being \\"to Australia what the Sex Pistols were to Britain and the Ramones to America,\\" while Radio Birdman are regarded as co-founders of punk but have also been designated as proto-punk.

The neighborhood is home to three universities, museums, and hospitals, as well as an abundance of shopping, restaurants, and recreational activities. Oakland is home to the Schenley Farms National Historic District which encompasses two city designated historic districts: the mostly residential Schenley Farms Historic District and the predominantly institutional Oakland Civic Center Historic District. It is also home to the locally designated Oakland Square Historic District. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire has Fire Station No. 14 on McKee Place and Fire Station No. 10 on Allequippa Street in Oakland. Neighborhoods Oakland is officially divided into four neighborhoods: North Oakland, West Oakland, Central Oakland, and South Oakland. Each section has a unique identity, and offers its own flavor of venues and housing. Oakland is Pittsburgh's second most populated neighborhood with 22,210 residents, a majority of these residents being students. Scattered amongst Oakland's four neighborhoods are 29 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. These Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this densely populated area.As of 2020, two of these public stairways, Joncaire Street (Central Oakland) and Louisa Street (West Oakland), also contain runnels which allow cyclists to easily transport a bike up or down the flight.  North Oakland  North Oakland can be loosely defined as the area of Oakland between Neville and Bouquet Streets, encompassing all of Craig Street and running north to Polish Hill. The Cathedral of Learning, the engineering or midsection of the University of Pittsburgh campus, and the Craig Street business district are in North Oakland. RAND's Pittsburgh center is located in North Oakland as well as the long time RIDC business incubator on Henry Street. The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, the largest mosque in the city, is located in North Oakland. This sector is also home to the Schenley Farms Historic District and many mid-rise condominium and apartment buildings.  Central Oakland  Central Oakland is bordered by Schenley Park, the Boulevard of the Allies, Fifth Avenue, and Halket Street. Many students at the University of Pittsburgh who decide to live off-campus reside in this neighborhood. Many of its homes are historic masonry structures dating from the turn of the century. The area is often mistakenly called South Oakland. Its Main Business District runs along Forbes and Fifth Avenue, and contains a diversity of restaurants, retailers, and financial services. These businesses are organized by the Oakland Business Improvement District (OBID). Smaller business districts in Central Oakland provide additional dining options along Atwood Street and Semple Street. It is also the location of the relatively isolated and historic neighborhood of Panther Hollow which runs along Boundary Street in Junction Hollow as well as the Oakland Square Historic District.  South Oakland  South Oakland runs along the Monongahela River and forms a triangular shape between the Monongahela River, the Boulevard of the Allies, and the western bank of Junction Hollow. Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC and the Pittsburgh Technology Center are major landmarks of this neighborhood. The neighborhood is split between a riverfront flood plain to the southwest and a plateau to the northeast. The plateau is divided into two primarily residential areas which are separated from one another by Bates Street, which runs up a valley from the flood plain to the plateau. The residents of the neighborhood on the north side of Bates Avenue call their neighborhood Oakcliffe. The flood plain was previously packed with industrial sites such as the Pittsburgh Works Consolidated Gas Co. and the Jones & Laughlin Steel Co., but presently, the Pittsburgh Technology Center hosts facilities such as the Entertainment Technology Center of Carnegie Mellon University. Some residents of Central Oakland think of their neighborhood as being part of South Oakland. However, the border between Central Oakland and South Oakland is further south than they believe. The area between Forbes Avenue and Boulevard of the Allies is officially part of Central Oakland. Articles in some news media have made this error; for example, a column about street cleanliness near the University of Pittsburgh used the term \\"South Oakland\\" to describe an area entirely within the boundaries of Central Oakland. South Oakland is reputed to be a student neighborhood, but only 36.9% of its population is between the ages of 18 and 24, compared to Central Oakland's figure of 74.1%. The difference is largely because the area between Forbes Avenue and the Boulevard of the Allies houses many undergraduate students. While it is commonly considered to be in South Oakland, it is actually the heart of Central Oakland. South Oakland was the childhood home of Andy Warhol, and later the residence of fellow pop artist Keith Haring. Haring had his first art show while living in Oakland. NFL Hall of Fame Quarterback Dan Marino was also born in Oakland, not far from Warhol's home. Dan Marino Field on Frazier Street was named in honor of its native son. Although they were not contemporaries, Warhol and Marino grew up on the same block with their former houses only a few doors apart.  West Oakland  West Oakland, the smallest of the four districts, is bordered by Fifth Avenue in the south, DeSoto Street in the east, the Birmingham Bridge to the west, and Allequippa Street to the north. Carlow University and most of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center can be found there.  Not Oakland  Although the campus of Carnegie Mellon University and parts of Schenley Park, including Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and Flagstaff Hill are popularly referred to as being in Oakland, and are located with the 15213 zip code, they are actually part of the adjacent neighborhood of Squirrel Hill North. The border between Oakland and Squirrel Hill runs along Junction Hollow. History The name first appeared in 1839 in a local paper, Harris' Intelligencer. The area got its name from the abundance of oak trees found on the farm of William Eichenbaum, who settled there in 1840. Oakland developed rapidly following the Great Fire of 1845 in Downtown Pittsburgh, with many people moving out to suburban territory. By 1860, there was considerable commercial development along Fifth Avenue. In 1868, Oakland Township, just two years after seceding from Pitt Township, was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh. Twenty-one years later, Mary Schenley gave the city 300 acres in Oakland for a park. Officials bought another 100 acres from her for \\"Schenley Park.\\" And Mary Schenley gave another gift: land for Schenley Plaza. At Schenley Plaza, industrialist Andrew Carnegie built a library, museum and concert hall complex, which opened in 1895. In 1917, Teddy Roosevelt visited the neighborhood.http://bradystewartphoto.photoshelter.com/image/I0000TJ5bDxT9mYY Oakland has long been considered Pittsburgh's university center. Carnegie Mellon University is the result of a 1967 merger of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, founded in Oakland in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie, and Mellon Institute, founded in 1913 by Andrew W. and Richard B. Mellon to conduct industrial research. The University of Pittsburgh, which is heir to the Pittsburgh Academy that was incorporated in 1787, relocated to Oakland in 1909 from its campus that was then in Allegheny. Some of the most impressive architecture in Oakland is on Pitt's campus. In 1925, work began on what was then the world's tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. Although the Cathedral of Learning is now the fourth-tallest educationally purposed building in the world, it remains the world's second tallest university building, the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, and the second tallest gothic-styled building in the world. Oakland is also home to the university's French-Gothic revival Heinz Memorial Chapel and St. Paul Cathedral, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. It is also home of the main branch of the Carnegie Library, the Carnegie Museum, and Phipps Conservatory. Baseball fans might know Oakland for the beloved Forbes Field, which was built in 1909 as the third home to the Pittsburgh Pirates and first home to the Pittsburgh Steelers. While Forbes Field was closed in 1970, some remnants of the ballpark still stand. Pirates fans gather on the site each year on the anniversary of Bill Mazeroski's World Series winning home run on October 13, 1960. The Decade nightclub was a staple of the neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PBkeAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=6mEEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5076%2C3190859 Surrounding neighborhoods North Oakland has eight borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Bloomfield to the northeast, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill North to the east, Central Oakland to the south, West Oakland to the southwest, the Terrace Village region of the Hill District to the west, the Upper Hill District to the northwest Polish Hill to the north-northwest. North Oakland also runs catty-corner (without a direct border) with Lower Lawrenceville to the north with its meeting point in the middle of the Bloomfield Bridge. Central Oakland has five Pittsburgh neighborhood borders, including North Oakland to the north, Squirrel Hill North to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, South Oakland to the south and southwest, and West Oakland to the northwest. South Oakland has six land borders, including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Central Oakland to the northeast, Squirrel Hill South to the east, Greenfield to the southeast, Hazelwood to the south- southeast, Bluff to the west, and West Oakland to the northwest. Across the Monongahela River, South Oakland runs adjacent with Pittsburgh's South Side Flats neighborhood. West Oakland has six borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of North Oakland to the northeast, Central Oakland to the southeast, South Oakland to the south and south-southeast, Bluff to the southwest, and the Crawford-Roberts and Terrace Village regions of the Hill District to the west and northwest, respectively.

In 1955, the first effective polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. *Oakland was, at various points, the home of many professional Pittsburgh sports team, including the hockey Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL), Pittsburgh Steelers and the baseball Pittsburgh Pirates. They played at now-defunct venues such as the Duquesne Gardens, Pitt Stadium, and Forbes Field. *The Pittsburgh Symphony and many touring plays and musical acts performed at the also now-defunct Syria Mosque. The Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera also called the neighborhood home, performing until 1961 at Pitt Stadium. The Pittsburgh Playhouse was founded in Oakland. *WQED, Pittsburgh's PBS station and the first community-sponsored television station in the United States, has been located in Oakland since 1954, although it moved from its original building to a new, larger one in 1970.

He was the Senate's second official majority leader. While an article published by the Senate (see References) gives his year of birth as 1862, this is most probably incorrect. He was born in Winchester, Indiana, one of six children. His father was a lawyer, a Republican state legislator, and owner-editor of the local newspaper, the Winchester Herald. At the age of twelve, Watson accompanied his father to the 1876 Republican National Convention. Watson attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and graduated in 1886. At DePauw he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1886 and joined his father's law firm. Political career Watson campaigned for Republican candidates throughout the 1880s and moved to Rushville, Indiana in 1893. He was elected as U.S. Representative from Indiana's 4th congressional district in 1894 to the 54th Congress (1895‚Äì1897), defeating the incumbent Democratic William S. Holman, in part by speaking German, the language of many of his constituents. He was defeated by Holman in 1896, but was elected from Indiana's 6th congressional district in 1898 to the 56th Congress and reelected to the 57th, 58th, 59th and 60th Congresses (1899‚Äì1909). Shortly after his arrival in Washington, Watson became the \\"right-hand man\\" and prot√©g√© of Speaker Joe Cannon. Cannon ensured his selection as the Republican whip, trusted him with party strategy in the House of Representatives, and placed him on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. While Cannon had his share of adversaries in the House, Watson enjoyed the attention of a wide circle of friends. An enthusiastic storyteller and poker player, he attracted members from both parties. Colleagues would come to the House chamber just to hear him speaknot to be swayed by his conservative views, but to see him put on a good show. As one writer observed, Watson \\"would work himself up to an astonishing pitch, tear off his collar and necktie, then throw aside his coat and vest, until, clad in trousers, shirt, and suspenders, he could really let himself go.\\" Watson left the House to run for Governor of Indiana in 1908. Opposed by organized labor, he lost the election to Thomas R. Marshall, the future vice president under Woodrow Wilson. He resumed a private law practice in Rushville, though he continued to participate in Washington politics, supporting Cannon after House Democrats and Republican \\"insurgents\\" attempted to oust the speaker in 1909. The following year, Watson wrote Cannon's famous speech defending the leadership's authority, party government, and the rights of the majority. A pivotal moment in House history, the speech enabled Cannon to keep his position, but at a great reduction in power. The House adopted a resolution that prevented Cannon and subsequent speakers from serving on or appointing members to the all-important Rules Committee. In the years after the House rebellion, Watson remained a prominent figure on Capitol Hill. Among other pursuits, he was a lobbyist for the American Manufacturers Association. While detractors, including members of the House, questioned the propriety of his new occupation, the criticism did not hurt his political standing in Indiana. In fact, he became known as an Indiana boss, and state politicians sought his endorsement as a necessary precursor to winning elections or appointments to higher office. In 1916, Watson entered the U.S. Senate race against Democratic Senator John W. Kern, but his bitter primary battle against Harry S. New threatened to divide the state Republican party. Watson won the majority of primary delegates, but according to one source, New had \\"convincing affidavits of fraud\\" committed by Watson. As a result, Republican leaders could not decide which candidate to support. They were saved from making the decision when Indiana's other senator, Benjamin F. Shiveley, died in March. Both Republican candidates ran for Senate seats in the general election. New defeated Kern, and Watson won the remainder of Shively's term. He was reelected twice (1920 and 1926), serving from 1916 to 1933. During his Senate tenure, he was * majority leader 1929-1933 * chairman, Committee on Woman Suffrage (1919‚Äì21), * chairman, Committee on Revision of the Laws (1919‚Äì21), * chairman, Committee on Enrolled Bills (1923‚Äì25), * chairman, Committee on Interstate Commerce (1925‚Äì1929), * chairman, Republican Conference (1929‚Äì33) In 1929, he was a defendant in a lawsuit wherein it was alleged by William M. Rogers, an avowed Klansman, that Watson had forced him to sign an affidavit recanting testimony before a Senate committee that Watson was also a member of the Ku Klux Klan.http://time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,732501,00.html The Democrats swept both Congress and the presidency in the election of 1932, and Watson lost his Senate seat in a landslide defeat. Following the election, however, Watson remained a fixture of the Washington scene, practicing law and trading stories with his former colleagues in the Republican cloakroom. He also retained, to a lesser degree, his power over Indiana politics. Wendell Willkie, a Republican convert and fellow Hoosier, could attest that Watson's support, or lack thereof, meant everything in the state. When Willkie ran for president in 1940, Watson would not endorse the former Democrat. Reportedly, he justified his refusal by saying, \\"I may welcome a repentant sinner into my church, but I wouldn't want him to lead the church choir.\\" Watson is credited with originating the saying If you can't lick 'em, jine 'em.http://www.bartleby.com/73/257.html Watson died in 1948 in Washington D.C. at the age of 83. Dr. Frederick Brown Harris, the former Senate chaplain, performed the funeral service in Washington. Until the end, Watson remained well liked, if not well respected, by House and Senate members. Perhaps only Hoover and Willkie bore a lasting grudge against him. Indeed, even his harshest critics considered Watson the man \\"impossible not to like\\". He is interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery, Suitland, Maryland.

It was founded in 1939 and is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It is a favorite spot to watch the migration of the Sandhill cranes in the fall. The reserve is open year-round and provides safe harbor for its varied wildlife. Location The name of the refuge means \\"woods of the Apache\\" in Spanish, named for the Apache tribes that once camped in the forests along the Rio Grande. The heart of the refuge comprises approximately of Rio Grande floodplain and of irrigated farms and wetlands. In addition to this, the refuge contains of arid grasslands and foothills of the Chupadera and San Pascual Mountains. About of this is designated as wilderness. A twelve-mile-long (19 km) loop road divided by a cutoff into a \\"Farm Loop\\" and \\"Marsh Loop\\" allows automobile drivers excellent views of wetland wildlife and raptors, and there are several short (1.5 to 10 miles) walking trails. The road affords good views of the fields where crops are grown for the benefit of the birds under cooperative agreements with farmers. Adjacent to the Visitor's Center, a desert plant garden is maintained.  Terrain  About 7,000 acres (28 km2) in the center of the refuge are made up of flood-plains watered by irrigation systems connected to the Rio Grande. These flood-plains provide an essential habitat for cottonwood and honey mesquite trees, Goodings and coyote willows, and four-wing saltbushes. The plains are flooded periodically to give these plants the best growing conditions. The flood plains also grow foods for the wildlife that need marshlands to grow. These plants include smartweed, millet, chufa, bulrush, and sedge. These marshlands begin dry, and are burned or turned over before they are flooded in order to produce fresh soil for the new plants. They are then flooded to become the breeding grounds for these marsh plants. The Bosque del Apache is also made up of several acres of dry land. One unit contains 5,440 acres (23 km2) of scrubland and desert terrain that is connected to the Chihuahuan desert. This area is called the Chupadera Peak Wilderness Unit. In addition to desert terrain, the Chupadera Peak Wilderness Unit is characterized by tall, reddish cliffs. Birds There have been 374 different bird species observed in the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge since 1981 according to eBird, making it one of the most diverse areas for bird species in the United States . The wetlands attract the huge flocks of wintering cranes and geese that are the refuge's most interesting feature. Many other speciesnotably waterfowl, shorebirds, and birds of preyalso winter in the refuge. Striking vagrants such as a groove-billed ani and Rufous-necked Wood-rail have been found there. In the Chihuahuan desert terrain outside of the Rio Grande riparian zone, the refuge also hosts three federally designated Wilderness areas (Chupadera, Little San Pascual, and Indian Well). The diversity of birds is also high in spring, particularly the last week of April and first week of May, and in fall. In summer the area is hot but many water birds can be found, including such New Mexico rarities as the least bittern and occasionally the little blue heron. Late November to late February is the best time for large numbers of birds, typically over 10,000 sandhill cranes and over 20,000 Ross's and snow geese. An annual 'festival of the cranes' is held the weekend before Thanksgiving as large numbers of cranes begin arriving in the refuge. Winter visitors generally plan to be in the refuge at sunrise or sunset, when the flocks of cranes and geese that roost in the refuge \\"commute\\" to or from local fields where they feed. Although winter sunsets and especially sunrises are chilly, the daily low temperature is seldom far below freezing. Visitors typically stay in the nearby RV park or in Socorro or San Antonio.

The scope of Greek habitation and rule has varied throughout the ages and as a result the history of Greece is similarly elastic in what it includes. Generally, the history of Greece is divided into the following periods: *Neolithic Greece; covering a period beginning with the establishment of agricultural societies in 7000 BC and ending in BC. Ancient Greece usually encompasses Greek antiquity, while part of the region's late prehistory (Late Bronze Age) is also condidered part of it: *Bronze Age (Cycladic culture, Minoan and Helladic); chronology covering a period beginning with the transition to a metal-based economy in 3200/3100 BC to the rise and fall of the Mycenaean Greek palaces spanning roughly five centuries (1600‚Äì1100 BC). *Greek Dark Ages (or Iron Age, Homeric Age), 1100-800 BC *Archaic period, 800-500 BC *Classical period 500-420 BC *Hellenistic period, 420-146 BC. *Roman Greece; covering a period from the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC to AD 324. *Byzantine Greece; covering a period from the establishment of the capital city of Byzantium, Constantinople, in AD 324 until the fall of Constantinople in AD 1453. *Frankish/Latin Greece; (including the Venetian possessions) covering a period from the Fourth Crusade (1204) to 1797, year of disestablishment of the Venetian Republic. *Ottoman Greece; covering a period from 1453 up until the Greek Revolution of 1821, *Modern Greece; covering a period from 1821 to present. At its cultural and geographical peak, Greek civilization spread from Egypt all the way to the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. Since then, Greek minorities have remained in former Greek territories (e.g. Turkey, Albania, Italy, Libya, Levant, Armenia, Georgia) and Greek emigrants have assimilated into differing societies across the globe (e.g. North America, Australia, Northern Europe, South Africa). At present, most Greeks live in the modern states of Greece (independent since 1821) and Cyprus. Prehistoric Greece Neolithic to Bronze Age (7000‚Äì1100 BC) Proto-Greek linguistic area according to linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev.. The Neolithic Revolution reached Europe beginning in 7000‚Äì6500 BC when agriculturalists from the Near East entered the Greek peninsula from Anatolia by island-hopping through the Aegean Sea. The earliest Neolithic sites with developed agricultural economies in Europe dated 8500‚Äì9000 BPE are found in Greece. The first Greek-speaking tribes, speaking the predecessor of the Mycenaean language, arrived in the Greek mainland sometime in the Neolithic period or the Early Bronze Age ( 3200 BC).A comprehensive overview in J.T. Hooker's Mycenaean Greece (); for a different hypothesis excluding massive migrations and favoring an autochthonous scenario, see Colin Renfrew's \\"Problems in the General Correlation of Archaeological and Linguistic Strata in Prehistoric Greece: The Model of Autochthonous Origin\\" () in Bronze Age Migrations by R.A. Crossland and A. Birchall, eds. (1973).. Cycladic and Minoan civilization The Cycladic culture is a significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age culture, is best known for its schematic flat female idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age (\\"Minoan\\") culture arose in Crete, to the south. The Minoan civilization in Crete lasted from about BC (Early Minoan) to BC,. and the Helladic culture on the Greek mainland from to . Little specific information is known about the Minoans (even the name Minoans is a modern appellation, derived from Minos, the legendary king of Crete), including their written system, which was recorded on the undeciphered Linear A script and Cretan hieroglyphs. They were primarily a mercantile people engaged in extensive overseas trade throughout the Mediterranean region. Minoan civilization was affected by a number of natural cataclysms such as the volcanic eruption at Thera (c. 1628‚Äì1627 BC) and earthquakes (c. 1600 BC). In 1425 BC, the Minoan palaces (except Knossos) were devastated by fire, which allowed the Mycenaean Greeks, influenced by the Minoans' culture, to expand into Crete. The Minoan civilization which preceded the Mycenaean civilization on Crete was revealed to the modern world by Sir Arthur Evans in 1900, when he purchased and then began excavating a site at Knossos.; . Mycenaean civilization Mycenaean Greece, 1400‚Äì1100 BC. Mycenaean civilization originated and evolved from the society and culture of the Early and Middle Helladic periods in mainland Greece.; . It emerged in 1600 BC, when Helladic culture in mainland Greece was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete and lasted until the collapse of the Mycenaean palaces in c. 1100 BC. Mycenaean Greece is the Late Helladic Bronze Age civilization of Ancient Greece and it is the historical setting of the epics of Homer and most of Greek mythology and religion. The Mycenaean period takes its name from the archaeological site Mycenae in the northeastern Argolid, in the Peloponnesos of southern Greece. Athens, Pylos, Thebes, and Tiryns are also important Mycenaean sites. Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior aristocracy. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script called Linear A to write their early form of Greek. The Mycenaean-era script is called Linear B, which was deciphered in 1952 by Michael Ventris. The Mycenaeans buried their nobles in beehive tombs (tholoi), large circular burial chambers with a high-vaulted roof and straight entry passage lined with stone. They often buried daggers or some other form of military equipment with the deceased. The nobility were often buried with gold masks, tiaras, armor and jeweled weapons. Mycenaeans were buried in a sitting position, and some of the nobility underwent mummification. Around 1100‚Äì1050 BC, the Mycenaean civilization collapsed. Numerous cities were sacked and the region entered what historians see as a \\"dark age\\". During this period, Greece experienced a decline in population and literacy. The Greeks themselves have traditionally blamed this decline on an invasion by another wave of Greek people, the Dorians, although there is scant archaeological evidence for this view. Ancient Greece (1100‚Äì146 BC) The ancient theatre of Dodona The Temple of Hephaestus in Athens Ancient Greece refers to a period of Greek history that lasted from the Dark Ages to the end of antiquity ( AD 600). In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the Roman Empire, but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations, while others argue that these civilizations were so different from later Greek cultures that they should be classed separately. Traditionally, the Ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first Olympic Games in 776 BC, but most historians now extend the term back to about 1000 BC. The traditional date for the end of the Classical Greek period is the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. The period that follows is classed as Hellenistic. Not everyone treats the Classical Greek and Hellenic periods as distinct; however, and some writers treat the Ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of Christianity in the 3rd century AD. Ancient Greece is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of Western civilization. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe. Ancient Greek civilization has been immensely influential on the language, politics, educational systems, philosophy, art and architecture of the modern world, particularly during the Renaissance in Western Europe and again during various neo-classical revivals in 18th and 19th-century Europe and the Americas. Iron Age (1100‚Äì800 BC) The Greek Dark Ages ( BC) refers to the period of Greek history from the presumed Dorian invasion and end of the Mycenaean civilization in the 11th century BC to the rise of the first Greek city-states in the 9th century BC and the epics of Homer and earliest writings in the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC. The collapse of the Mycenaean coincided with the fall of several other large empires in the near east, most notably the Hittite and the Egyptian. The cause may be attributed to an invasion of the Sea People wielding iron weapons. When the Dorians came down into Greece they also were equipped with superior iron weapons, easily dispersing the already weakened Mycenaeans. The period that follows these events is collectively known as the Greek Dark Ages. Kings ruled throughout this period until eventually they were replaced with an aristocracy, then still later, in some areas, an aristocracy within an aristocracy‚Äîan elite of the elite. Warfare shifted from a focus on cavalry to a great emphasis on infantry. Due to its cheapness of production and local availability, iron replaced bronze as the metal of choice in the manufacturing of tools and weapons. Slowly equality grew among the different sects of people, leading to the dethronement of the various Kings and the rise of the family. At the end of this period of stagnation, the Greek civilization was engulfed in a renaissance that spread the Greek world as far as the Black Sea and Spain. Writing was relearned from the Phoenicians, eventually spreading north into Italy and the Gauls. Archaic Greece In the 8th century BC, Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages which followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and Mycenaean script forgotten, but the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, modifying it to create the Greek alphabet. From about the 9th century BC, written records begin to appear.. Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities, a pattern largely dictated by Greek geography, where every island, valley and plain is cut off from its neighbours by the sea or mountain ranges.. The Archaic period can be understood as the Orientalizing period, when Greece was at the fringe, but not under the sway, of the budding Neo-Assyrian Empire. Greece adopted significant amounts of cultural elements from the Orient, in art as well as in religion and mythology. Archaeologically, Archaic Greece is marked by Geometric pottery. Classical Greece Bust of Herodotus in Stoa of Attalus, one of the earliest nameable historians whose work survives. Leonidas at Thermopylae by Jacques-Louis David. The basic unit of politics in Ancient Greece was the polis, sometimes translated as city-state. \\"Politics\\" literally means \\"the things of the polis\\" where each city-state was independent, at least in theory. Some city-states might be subordinate to others (a colony traditionally deferred to its mother city), some might have had governments wholly dependent upon others (the Thirty Tyrants in Athens was imposed by Sparta following the Peloponnesian War), but the titularly supreme power in each city was located within that city. This meant that when Greece went to war (e.g., against the Persian Empire), it took the form of an alliance going to war. It also gave ample opportunity for wars within Greece between different cities. Persian Wars Two major wars shaped the Classical Greek world. The Persian Wars (499‚Äì449 BC) are recounted in Herodotus's Histories. By the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire ruled over all Greek city states in Ionia (the western coast of modern- day Turkey) and had made territorial gains in the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper as well. The Greek cities of Ionia, led by Miletus, revolted against the Persian Empire, and were supported by some mainland cities, including Athens and Eretria. After the uprising had been quelled, Darius I launched the First Persian invasion of Greece to exact revenge on the Athenians. In 492 BC, Persian general Mardonius led an army (supported by a fleet) across the Hellespont, re-subjugating Thrace and adding Macedonia as a fully-subjugated client kingdom.. However, before he could reach Greece proper, his fleet was destroyed in a storm near Mount Athos. In 490 BC, Darius sent another fleet directly across the Aegean (rather than following the land route as Mardonius had done) to subdue Athens. After destroying the city of Eretria, the fleet landed and faced the Athenian army at Marathon, which ended in a decisive Athenian victory. Darius's successor, Xerxes I, launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. Despite Greek defeat at Thermopylae, after which the Persians briefly overran northern and central Greece,. the Greek city- states once again managed to comprehensively defeat the invaders with naval victory at Salamis and victory on land at Plataea. To prosecute the war and then to defend Greece from further Persian attack, Athens founded the Delian League in 477 BC. Initially, each city in the League would contribute ships and soldiers to a common army, but in time Athens allowed (and then compelled) the smaller cities to contribute funds so that it could supply their quota of ships. Secession from the League could be punished. Following military reversals against the Persians, the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens, further strengthening the latter's control over the League. The Delian League was eventually referred to pejoratively as the Athenian Empire. In 458 BC, while the Persian Wars were still ongoing, war broke out between the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League, comprising Sparta and its allies. After some inconclusive fighting, the two sides signed a peace in 447 BC. That peace was stipulated to last thirty years: instead it held only until 431 BC, with the onset of the Peloponnesian War. Our main sources concerning this war are Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War and Xenophon's Hellenica. Peloponnesian War The war began over a dispute between Corcyra and Epidamnus. Corinth intervened on the Epidamnian side. Fearful lest Corinth capture the Corcyran navy (second only to the Athenian in size), Athens intervened. It prevented Corinth from landing on Corcyra at the Battle of Sybota, laid siege to Potidaea, and forbade all commerce with Corinth's closely situated ally, Megara (the Megarian decree). There was disagreement among the Greeks as to which party violated the treaty between the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues, as Athens was technically defending a new ally. The Corinthians turned to Sparta for aid. Fearing the growing might of Athens, and witnessing Athens' willingness to use it against the Megarians (the embargo would have ruined them), Sparta declared the treaty to have been violated and the Peloponnesian War began in earnest. The first stage of the war (known as the Archidamian War for the Spartan king, Archidamus II) lasted until 421 BC with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. The Athenian general Pericles recommended that his city fight a defensive war, avoiding battle against the superior land forces led by Sparta, and importing everything needful by maintaining its powerful navy. Athens would simply outlast Sparta, whose citizens feared to be out of their city for long lest the helots revolt. This strategy required that Athens endure regular sieges, and in 430 BC it was visited with an awful plague that killed about a quarter of its people, including Pericles. With Pericles gone, less conservative elements gained power in the city and Athens went on the offensive. It captured 300‚Äì400 Spartan hoplites at the Battle of Pylos. This represented a significant fraction of the Spartan fighting force which the latter decided it could not afford to lose. Meanwhile, Athens had suffered humiliating defeats at Delium and Amphipolis. The Peace of Nicias concluded with Sparta recovering its hostages and Athens recovering the city of Amphipolis. Map of the Delian League (\\"Athenian Empire or Alliance\\") in 431 BC, just prior to the Peloponnesian War. Those who signed the Peace of Nicias in 421 BC swore to uphold it for fifty years. The second stage of the Peloponnesian War began in 415 BC when Athens embarked on the Sicilian Expedition to support an ally (Segesta) attacked by Syracuse and to conquer Sicily. Initially, Sparta was reluctant, but Alcibiades, the Athenian general who had argued for the Sicilian Expedition, defected to the Spartan cause upon being accused of grossly impious acts and convinced them that they could not allow Athens to subjugate Syracuse. The campaign ended in disaster for the Athenians. Athens' Ionian possessions rebelled with the support of Sparta, as advised by Alcibiades. In 411 BC, an oligarchical revolt in Athens held out the chance for peace, but the Athenian navy, which remained committed to the democracy, refused to accept the change and continued fighting in Athens' name. The navy recalled Alcibiades (who had been forced to abandon the Spartan cause after reputedly seducing the wife of Agis II, a Spartan king) and made him its head. The oligarchy in Athens collapsed and Alcibiades reconquered what had been lost. In 407 BC, Alcibiades was replaced following a minor naval defeat at the Battle of Notium. The Spartan general Lysander, having fortified his city's naval power, won victory after victory. Following the Battle of Arginusae, which Athens won but was prevented by bad weather from rescuing some of its sailors, Athens executed or exiled eight of its top naval commanders. Lysander followed with a crushing blow at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC which almost destroyed the Athenian fleet. Athens surrendered one year later, ending the Peloponnesian War. The war had left devastation in its wake. Discontent with the Spartan hegemony that followed (including the fact that it ceded Ionia and Cyprus to the Persian Empire at the conclusion of the Corinthian War (395‚Äì387 BC); see Treaty of Antalcidas) induced the Thebans to attack. Their general, Epaminondas, crushed Sparta at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, inaugurating a period of Theban dominance in Greece. In 346 BC, unable to prevail in its ten-year war with Phocis, Thebes called upon Philip II of Macedon for aid. Macedon quickly forced the city states into being united by the League of Corinth which led to the conquering of the Persian Empire and the Hellenistic Age had begun. Hellenistic Greece Coin showing Demetrius I Poliorcetes. The Hellenistic period of Greek history begins with the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and ends with the annexation of the Greek peninsula and islands by Rome in 146 BC. Although the establishment of Roman rule did not break the continuity of Hellenistic society and culture, which remained essentially unchanged until the advent of Christianity, it did mark the end of Greek political independence. During the Hellenistic period, the importance of \\"Greece proper\\" (that is, the territory of modern Greece) within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centres of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria. (See Hellenistic civilization for the history of Greek culture outside Greece in this period.) Athens and her allies revolted against Macedon upon hearing that Alexander had died, but were defeated within a year in the Lamian War. Meanwhile, a struggle for power broke out among Alexander's generals, which resulted in the break-up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms (see the Wars of the Diadochi). Ptolemy was left with Egypt, Seleucus with the Levant, Mesopotamia, and points east. Control of Greece, Thrace, and Anatolia was contested, but by 298 BC the Antigonid dynasty had supplanted the Antipatrid. The Stag Hunt Mosaic at the Archaeological Museum of Pella (3rd BC) Macedonian control of the city-states was intermittent, with a number of revolts. Athens, Rhodes, Pergamum and other Greek states retained substantial independence, and joined the Aetolian League as a means of defending it and restoring democracy in their states, whereas they saw Macedon as a tyrannical kingdom because of the fact they had not adopted democracy. The Achaean League, while nominally subject to the Ptolemies was in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. Sparta also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league. Hellenistic realms included the Diadoch kingdoms: Also shown on the map: The orange areas were often in dispute after 281 BC. The Kingdom of Pergamon occupied some of this area. Not shown: Indo-Greek Kingdom. In 267 BC, Ptolemy II persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Macedon, in what became the Chremonidean War, after the Athenian leader Chremonides. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and her democratic institutions. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest and most cultivated city in Greece. In 225 BC, Macedon defeated the Egyptian fleet at Cos and brought the Aegean islands, except Rhodes, under its rule as well. Sparta remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC invaded Achaea and seized control of the League. The remaining Achaeans preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta, and allied with the former. In 222 BC, the Macedonian army defeated the Spartans and annexed their city‚Äîthe first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a different state. Philip V of Macedon was the last Greek ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the ever-increasing power of Rome. Under his auspices, the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum. In 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome's enemy Carthage. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in Asia Minor. The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome. In 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage, and was free to turn her attention eastwards. In 198 BC, the Second Macedonian War broke out because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the Seleucid Empire, the greatest power in the east. Philip's allies in Greece deserted him and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flaminius. Luckily for the Greeks, Flaminius was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but was otherwise spared. At the Isthmian Games in 196 BC, Flaminius declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and Chalcis. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and aristocratic constitutions were favoured and actively promoted. Roman Greece (146 BC‚Äì AD 324) Scene of the Battle of Corinth (146 BC): last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the city of Corinth. The last day on Corinth, Tony Robert-Fleury, 1870 View of the Roman Odeon of Patras Militarily, Greece itself declined to the point that the Romans conquered the land (168 BC onwards), though Greek culture would in turn conquer Roman life. Although the period of Roman rule in Greece is conventionally dated as starting from the sacking of Corinth by the Roman Lucius Mummius in 146 BC, Macedonia had already come under Roman control with the defeat of its king, Perseus, by the Roman Aemilius Paullus at Pydna in 168 BC. The Romans divided the region into four smaller republics, and in 146 BC Macedonia officially became a province, with its capital at Thessalonica. The rest of the Greek city-states gradually and eventually paid homage to Rome ending their de jure autonomy as well. The Romans left local administration to the Greeks without making any attempt to abolish traditional political patterns. The agora in Athens continued to be the centre of civic and political life. Caracalla's decree in AD 212, the Constitutio Antoniniana, extended citizenship outside Italy to all free adult men in the entire Roman Empire, effectively raising provincial populations to equal status with the city of Rome itself. The importance of this decree is historical, not political. It set the basis for integration where the economic and judicial mechanisms of the state could be applied throughout the Mediterranean as was once done from Latium into all Italy. In practice of course, integration did not take place uniformly. Societies already integrated with Rome, such as Greece, were favored by this decree, in comparison with those far away, too poor or just too alien such as Britain, Palestine or Egypt. Caracalla's decree did not set in motion the processes that led to the transfer of power from Italy and the West to Greece and the East, but rather accelerated them, setting the foundations for the millennium-long rise of Greece, in the form of the Eastern Roman Empire, as a major power in Europe and the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages. Middle Ages Byzantine rule (324‚ÄìAD 1204) Byzantine era monasteries in Meteora Depiction of the Greek fire by John Skylitzes' Chronicle (late 11th century). The division of the empire into East and West and the subsequent collapse of the Western Roman Empire were developments that constantly accentuated the position of the Greeks in the empire and eventually allowed them to become identified with it altogether. The leading role of Constantinople began when Constantine the Great turned Byzantium into the new capital of the Roman Empire, from then on to be known as Constantinople, placing the city at the center of Hellenism, a beacon for the Greeks that lasted to the modern era. The figures of Constantine the Great and Justinian dominated during 324‚Äì610. Assimilating the Roman tradition, the emperors sought to offer the basis for later developments and for the formation of the Byzantine Empire. Efforts to secure the borders of the Empire and to restore the Roman territories marked the early centuries. At the same time, the definitive formation and establishment of the Orthodox doctrine, but also a series of conflicts resulting from heresies that developed within the boundaries of the empire, marked the early period of Byzantine history. In the first period of the middle Byzantine era (610‚Äì867), the empire was attacked both by old enemies (Persians, Lombards, Avars and Slavs) as well as by new ones, appearing for the first time in history (Arabs, Bulgars). The main characteristic of this period was that the enemy attacks were not localized to the border areas of the state but they were extended deep beyond, even threatening the capital itself. The attacks of the Slavs lost their periodical and temporary character and became permanent settlements that transformed into new states, initially hostile to Constantinople until their christianization. Those states were referred by the Byzantines as Sclavinias. Changes were also observed in the internal structure of the empire which was dictated by both external and internal conditions. The predominance of the small free farmers, the expansion of the military estates and the development of the system of themes, brought to completion developments that had started in the previous period. Changes were noted also in the sector of administration: the administration and society had become immiscibly Greek, while the restoration of Orthodoxy after the iconoclast movement, allowed the successful resumption of missionary action among neighboring peoples and their placement within the sphere of Byzantine cultural influence. During this period the state was geographically reduced and economically damaged, since it lost wealth- producing regions; however, it obtained greater lingual, dogmatic and cultural homogeneity. From the late 8th century, the Empire began to recover from the devastating impact of successive invasions, and the reconquest of Greek peninsula began. Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor were brought in as settlers. The Slavs were either driven out to Asia Minor or assimilated and the Sclavinias were eliminated. By the middle of the 9th century, Greece was Byzantine again, and the cities began to recover due to improved security and the restoration of effective central control. Economic prosperity Part of the Byzantine Walls of Thessaloniki When the Byzantine Empire was rescued from a period of crisis by the resolute leadership of the three Komnenoi emperors Alexios, John and Manuel in the 12th century, Greece prospered. Recent research has revealed that this period was a time of significant growth in the rural economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. The widespread construction of new rural churches is a strong indication that prosperity was being generated even in remote areas. A steady increase in population led to a higher population density, and there is good evidence that the demographic increase was accompanied by the revival of towns. According to Alan Harvey's Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire 900‚Äì1200, towns expanded significantly in the twelfth century. Archaeological evidence shows an increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a ‚Äònotable upsurge‚Äô in new towns. Archaeological evidence tells us that many of the medieval towns, including Athens, Thessaloniki, Thebes and Corinth, experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the 11th century and continuing until the end of the 12th century. The growth of the towns attracted the Venetians, and this interest in trade appears to have further increased economic prosperity in Greece. Certainly, the Venetians and others were active traders in the ports of the Holy Land, and they made a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. Artistic revival Exterior view of Hosios Loukas monastery, artistic example of the Macedonian Renaissance A kind of \\"Renaissance\\" of the Byzantine art began since the 10th century. Many of the most important Byzantine churches in and around Athens, for example, were built during these two centuries, and this reflects the growth of urbanisation in Greece during this period. There was also a revival in the mosaic art with artists showing great interest in depicting natural landscapes with wild animals and scenes from the hunt. Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. With its love of luxury and passion for color, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling color animals‚Äîlions, elephants, eagles, and griffins‚Äîconfronting each other, or representing Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase. The eyes of many patrons were attracted and the economy of Greece grew. In the provinces, regional schools of Architecture began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences. All this suggests that there was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. Yet the marvelous expansion of Byzantine art during this period, one of the most remarkable facts in the history of the empire, did not stop there. From the 10th to the 12th century, Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly show their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefalu, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, prove the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the 12th century. Hispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of Monte Cassino, merchants of Amalfi, and the Norman kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the 12th century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centers dedicated to its production. The Fourth Crusade (1204) The division of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade. The year 1204 marks the beginning of the Late Byzantine period when Constantinople and a number of Byzantine territories were conquered by the Latins during the Fourth Crusade. During this period, a number of Byzantine Greek successor states emerged such as the Empire of Nicaea, the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Trebizond, such as number of Frankish/Latin Catholic states (Principality of Achaea, Duchy of Athens, Duchy of the Archipelago, Kingdom of Thessalonica etc.) In Latin-occupied territories, elements of feudality entered medieval Greek life. From partial Byzantine restoration to 1453 The Latin Empire, however, lasted only 57 years, when in 1261 Constantinople was reclaimed by the Byzantine Greeks and the Byzantine Empire was restored. However, in mainland Greece and islands various Latin possessions continued to exist. From 1261 onwards, Byzantium underwent a gradual weakening of its internal structures and the reduction of its territories from Ottoman invasions culminating in the Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453. The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople resulted in the official end of both the Eastern Roman empire and the Byzantine period of Greek history. Venetian and Ottoman rule (15th century‚ÄìAD 1821) The Battle of Navarino, on October 1827, marked the effective end of Ottoman rule in Greece. The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, and the Venetians and Genoese clung to some of the islands, but by the early 16th century all of mainland Greece and most of the Aegean islands were in Ottoman hands, excluding several port cities still held by the Venetians (Nafplio, Monemvasia, Parga and Methone the most important of them). The Cyclades islands, in the middle of the Aegean, were officially annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, although they were under vassal status since the 1530s. Cyprus fell in 1571, and the Venetians retained Crete until 1669. The Ionian Islands were never ruled by the Ottomans, with the exception of Kefalonia (from 1479 to 1481 and from 1485 to 1500), and remained under the rule of the Republic of Venice. It was in the Ionian Islands where modern Greek statehood was born, with the creation of the Republic of the Seven Islands in 1800. Ottoman Greece was a multiethnic society. However, the modern Western notion of multiculturalism, although at first glance appears to correspond to the system of millets, is considered to be incompatible with the Ottoman system.Maurus Reinkowski, ‚ÄúOttoman ‚ÄúMulticulturalism‚Äù? The Example of the Confessional System in Lebanon‚Äù. Lecture , Istanbul, 1997. Edited by the Orient-Institut der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, Beirut,1999, pp. 15, 16. The Greeks with the one hand were given some privileges and freedom; with the other they were exposed to a tyranny deriving from the malpractices of its administrative personnel over which the central government had only remote and incomplete control.Douglas Dakin, The Greek Struggle for Independence, 1821-1833. University of California Press, p. 16.When the Ottomans arrived, two Greek migrations occurred. The first migration entailed the Greek intelligentsia migrating to Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance. The second migration entailed Greeks leaving the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettling in the mountains. The millet system contributed to the ethnic cohesion of Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the Ottoman Empire based on religion. The Greeks living in the plains during Ottoman rule were either Christians who dealt with the burdens of foreign rule or crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith). Some Greeks became crypto- Christians to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. However, Greeks who converted to Islam and were not crypto-Christians were deemed \\"Turks\\" (Muslims) in the eyes of Orthodox Greeks, even if they didn't adopt the Turkish language. The Ottomans ruled most of Greece until the early 19th century. The first self-governed, since the Middle Ages, Hellenic state was established during the French Revolutionary Wars, in 1800, 21 years before the outbreak of the Greek revolution in mainland Greece. It was the Septinsular Republic with Corfu as capital. Modern Greek nation state (1821‚Äìpresent) Nafplio, the first capital of independent Greece during the governance of Ioannis Kapodistrias In the early months of 1821, the Greeks declared their independence, but did not achieve it until 1829. The Great Powers first shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the status quo of the Ottoman Empire, but soon changed their stance. Scores of non-Greeks philhellenes volunteered to fight for the cause, including Lord Byron. On October 20, 1827, a combined British, French and Russian naval force destroyed the Ottoman and Egyptian armada. The Russian minister of foreign affairs, Ioannis Kapodistrias, himself a Greek, returned home as President of the new Republic. The first capital of the independent Greece was temporarily Aigina (1828‚Äì1829) and later officially Nafplion (1828‚Äì1834). After his assassination, the European powers turned Greece into a monarchy; the first King, Otto, came from Bavaria and the second, George I, from Denmark. In 1834, King Otto transferred the capital to Athens. The territorial evolution of Kingdom of Greece until 1947 During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Greece sought to enlarge its boundaries to include the ethnic Greek population of the Ottoman Empire. Greece played a peripheral role in the Crimean War. When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, Greek leaders saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had a Christian majority. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. The French and British seized its major port and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greek efforts to cause insurrections failed as they were easily crushed by Ottoman forces. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war. The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate. The Ionian Islands were given by Britain upon the arrival of the new King George I in 1863 and Thessaly was ceded by the Ottomans in 1880. Modernization George I was King of the Hellenes from 1862 to 1913 In the late 19th century, modernization transformed the social structure of Greece. The population grew rapidly, putting heavy pressure on the system of small farms with low productivity. Overall, population density more than doubled from 41 persons per square mile in 1829 to 114 in 1912 (16 to 44 per km2). One response was emigration to the United States, with a quarter million people leaving between 1906 and 1914. Entrepreneurs found numerous business opportunities in the retail and restaurant sectors of American cities; some sent money back to their families, others returned with hundreds of dollars, enough to purchase a farm or a small business in the old village. The urban population tripled from 8% in 1853 to 24% in 1907. Athens grew from a village of 6000 people in 1834, when it became the capital, to 63,000 in 1879, 111,000 in 1896, and 167,000 in 1907.. In Athens and other cities, men arriving from rural areas set up workshops and stores, creating a middle class. They joined with bankers, professional men, university students, and military officers, to demand reform and modernization of the political and economic system. Athens became the center of the merchant marine, which quadrupled from 250,000 tons in 1875 to more than 1,000,000 tons in 1915. As the cities modernized, businessmen adopted the latest styles of Western European architecture.. Balkan Wars The landing of Greek troops in Kavala during the Balkan Wars The participation of Greece in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913 is one of the most important episodes in modern Greek history, as it allowed the Greek state to almost double its size and achieve most of its present territorial size. As a result of the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, most of Epirus, southern Macedonia, Crete and the northern Aegean islands were incorporated into the Kingdom of Greece.

The outbreak of World War I in 1914 produced a split in Greek politics, with King Constantine I, an admirer of Germany, calling for neutrality while Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos pushed for Greece to join the Allies.. The conflict between the monarchists and the Venizelists sometimes resulted in open warfare and became known as the National Schism. In 1917, the Allies forced Constantine to abdicate in favor of his son Alexander and Venizelos returned as premier. At the end of the war, the Great Powers agreed that the Ottoman city of Smyrna (Izmir) and its hinterland, both of which had large Greek populations, be handed over to Greece. Greek troops occupied Smyrna in 1919, and in 1920 the Treaty of S√®vres was signed by the Ottoman government; the treaty stipulated that in five years time a plebiscite would be held in Smyrna on whether the region would join Greece. However, Turkish nationalists, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, overthrew the Ottoman government and organised a military campaign against the Greek troops, resulting in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). A major Greek offensive ground to a halt in 1921, and by 1922 Greek troops were in retreat. The Turkish forces recaptured Smyrna on 9 September 1922, and setting the city ablaze and killing many Greeks and Armenians. The war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), according to which there was to be a population exchange between Greece and Turkey on the basis of religion. Over one million Orthodox Christians left Turkey in exchange for 400,000 Muslims from Greece. The events of 1919‚Äì1922 are regarded in Greece as a particularly calamitous period of history. Between 1914 and 1923, an estimated 750,000 to 900,000 Greeks died at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, in what many scholars have termed a genocide...

In August 1936, Prime Minister Metaxas, with the agreement of the king, suspended the parliament and established the quasi- fascist Metaxas regime. Despite the country's numerically small and ill- equipped armed forces, Greece made a decisive contribution to the Allied efforts in World War II. At the start of the war, Greece sided with the Allies and refused to give in to Italian demands. Italy invaded Greece by way of Albania on 28 October 1940, but Greek troops repelled the invaders after a bitter struggle (see Greco-Italian War). This marked the first Allied victory in the war. Primarily to secure his strategic southern flank, German dictator Adolf Hitler reluctantly stepped in and launched the Battle of Greece in April 1941. Axis units from Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy successfully invaded Greece, through Yugoslavia, forcing out the Greek defenders. The Greek government eventually decided to stop the fighting and thus stopped sending ammunition and supplies to the northern front and the defenders were easily overrun. The Greek government then proceeded, as the Nazi forces came towards the capital of Athens, to leave for Crete and then Cairo, Egypt. On 20 May 1941, the Germans attempted to seize Crete with a large attack by paratroopers, with the aim of reducing the threat of a counter-offensive by Allied forces in Egypt, but faced heavy resistance. The Greek campaign might have delayed German military plans against Soviet Union, and it is argued that had the German invasion of the Soviet Union started on 20 May 1941 instead of 22 June 1941, the Nazi assault against the Soviet Union might have succeeded. The heavy losses of German paratroopers led the Germans to launch no further large-scale air-invasions. During the Axis occupation of Greece, thousands of Greeks died in direct combat, in concentration camps, or of starvation. The occupiers murdered the greater part of the Jewish community despite efforts by Christian Greeks to shelter the Jews. The economy of Greece was devastated. When the Soviet Army began its drive across Romania in August 1944, the German Army in Greece began withdrawing north and northwestward from Greece into Yugoslavia and Albania to avoid being cut off in Greece. Hence, the German occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The Resistance group ELAS seized control of Athens on 12 October 1944. British troops had already landed on 4 October in Patras, and entered Athens on 14 October 1944.. Christina Goulter summarizes the devastation done to Greece during the war:. :\\"Between 1941 in 1945, over 8% of the Greek population had died; some 2000 villages and small towns had been razed to the ground; starvation was widespread due to the destruction of crops and worsened in many parts of Greece after liberation when agricultural labourers migrated to urban centres to escape politically inspired violence in the countryside; trade either internally or externally had all but ceased; most of Greece‚Äôs merchant marine lay at the bottom of the sea; and motorized transport had been confiscated by the axis occupiers.\\" Greek Civil War (1944‚Äì1949) Clashes in Athens during the Dekemvriana events The Greek Civil War () was the first major confrontation of the Cold War. It was fought between 1944 and 1949 in Greece between the nationalist/non-Marxist forces of Greece (financially supported by Great Britain at first, and later by the United States.) and the Democratic Army of Greece (ELAS), which was the military branch of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Democratic Army\\", as well as entry routes to Greece. The conflict resulted in a victory for the British ‚Äî and later U.S.-supported government forces, which led to Greece receiving American funds through the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, as well as becoming a member of NATO, which helped to define the ideological balance of power in the Aegean for the entire Cold War. The first phase of the civil war occurred in 1943‚Äì1944. Marxist and non-Marxist resistance groups fought each other in a fratricidal conflict to establish the leadership of the Greek resistance movement. In the second phase (December 1944), the ascendant communists, in military control of most of Greece, confronted the returning Greek government in exile, which had been formed under the auspices of the Western Allies in Cairo and originally included six KKE-affiliated ministers. In the third phase (called by some the \\"Third Round\\"), guerrilla forces controlled by the KKE fought against the internationally recognized Greek government which was formed after elections were boycotted by the KKE. Although the involvement of the KKE in the uprisings was universally known, the party remained legal until 1948, continuing to coordinate attacks from its Athens offices until proscription. The war, which lasted from 1946 to 1949, was characterised by guerilla warfare between the KKE forces and Greek governmental forces mainly in the mountain ranges of northern Greece. The war ended with the NATO bombing of Mount Grammos and the final defeat of the KKE forces. The civil war left Greece with a legacy of political polarization. As a result, Greece also entered into an alliance with the United States and joined NATO, while relationships with its communist northern neighbours, both pro-Soviet and neutral, became strained.  Postwar development and integration in Western Bloc (1949‚Äì1967)  In the 1950s and 1960s, Greece developed rapidly, initially with the help of the Marshall Plan's grants and loans, also to decrease the communist influence. In 1952, by joining NATO, Greece clearly became part of the Western Bloc of the Cold War. But in Greek society, the deep divide between the leftist and rightist sections continued. Greece economy advanced further through growth in the tourism sector. New attention was given to women's rights, and in 1952 suffrage for women was guaranteed in the Constitution, full Constitutional equality following, and Lina Tsaldari becoming the first female minister that decade. The Greek economic miracle is the period of sustained economic growth, generally from 1950 to 1973. During this period, the Greek economy grew by an average of 7.7%, second in the world only to Japan.Angus Maddison, \\"Monitoring the World Economy 1820-1992\\", OECD (1995)  Military dictatorship (1967‚Äì1974)  Protest against the junta by Greek political exiles in Germany, 1967 In 1967, the Greek military seized power in a coup d'√©tat, overthrowing the centre right government of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos.. It established the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 which became known as the R√©gime of the Colonels. The junta government's accession to power lead to an isolation to Greece from European affairs and froze Greece's entry to the European Union. In 1973, the r√©gime abolished the Greek monarchy and in 1974, dictator Papadopoulos denied help to the United States. After a second coup that year, Colonel Ioannides was appointed as the new head-of-state. Ioannides was responsible for the 1974 coup against President Makarios of Cyprus.. The coup became the pretext for the first wave of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 (see Greco-Turkish relations). The Cyprus events and the outcry following a bloody suppression of Athens Polytechnic uprising in Athens led to the implosion of the military r√©gime.  Third Hellenic Republic (1974‚Äìpresent)  After the end of the military r√©gime, democracy was restored. The fall of the junta was followed by the metapolitefsi. Metapolitefsi was initiated when Konstantinos Karamanlis returned from self- exile in Paris at the invitation of the junta, to become interim prime minister on July 23, 1974. and later gained re-election for two further terms at the head of the conservative New Democracy Party. In August 1974, Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of NATO in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.. In 1974, a referendum voted 69%‚Äì31% to confirm the deposition of King Constantine II. A democratic republican constitution came into force.. Another previously exiled politician, Andreas Papandreou also returned and founded the socialist PASOK Party (Panhellenic Socialist Movement), which won the 1981 election and dominated Greek politics for almost two decades.. The socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou After the restoration of democracy, Greece's stability and economic prosperity improved significantly. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980, joined the European Union (EU) in 1981 and adopted the euro as its currency in 2001. New infrastructure funds from the EU and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, services, light industry and the telecommunications industry have brought Greeks an unprecedented standard of living. Tensions continue to exist between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus and the delimitation of borders in the Aegean Sea but relations have considerably thawed following successive earthquakes, first in Turkey and then in Greece, and an outpouring of sympathy and generous assistance by ordinary Greeks and Turks (see Earthquake Diplomacy). Greece in the Eurozone The 2008 global economic recession impacted Greece, as well as the rest of the countries in the eurozone. From late 2009, fears developed in investment markets of a sovereign debt crisis concerning Greece's ability to pay its debts, in view of the large increase in the country's government debt. This crisis of confidence was indicated by a widening of bond yield spreads and risk insurance on credit default swaps compared to other countries, most importantly Germany. Downgrading of Greek government debt to junk bond status created alarm in financial markets. On 2 May 2010, the Eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a loan for Greece, conditional on the implementation of harsh austerity measures. In October 2011, Eurozone leaders also agreed on a proposal to write off 50% of Greek debt owed to private creditors, increasing the European Financial Stability Facility amount to about ‚Ç¨1 trillion, and requiring European banks to achieve 9% capitalization to reduce the risk of contagion to other countries. These austerity measures were extremely unpopular with the Greek public, precipitating demonstrations and civil unrest.

It represents the first advanced and distinctively Greek civilization in mainland Greece with its palatial states, urban organization, works of art, and writing system.Lazaridis, Iosif et al. \\"Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans\\". Nature, 2017 (Supplementary Information, \\"The Mycenaeans\\", pp. 2‚Äì3).. The most prominent site was Mycenae, in the Argolid, after which the culture of this era is named. Other centers of power that emerged included Pylos, Tiryns, Midea in the Peloponnese, Orchomenos, Thebes, Athens in Central Greece and Iolcos in Thessaly. Mycenaean and Mycenaean-influenced settlements also appeared in Epirus, Macedonia,Aegeo-Balkan Prehistory ‚Äì Mycenaean Sites on islands in the Aegean Sea, on the coast of Asia Minor, the Levant,; . Cyprus. and Italy.; . The Mycenaean Greeks introduced several innovations in the fields of engineering, architecture and military infrastructure, while trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the Mycenaean economy. Their syllabic script, the Linear B, offers the first written records of the Indo-European Greek language, and their religion already included several deities that can also be found in the Olympic Pantheon. Mycenaean Greece was dominated by a warrior elite society and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid hierarchical, political, social and economic systems. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax. Mycenaean Greece perished with the collapse of Bronze Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean, to be followed by the so-called Greek Dark Ages, a recordless transitional period leading to Archaic Greece where significant shifts occurred from palace-centralized to de-centralized forms of socio- economic organization (including the extensive use of iron).. Various theories have been proposed for the end of this civilization, among them the Dorian invasion or activities connected to the \\"Sea Peoples\\". Additional theories such as natural disasters and climatic changes have been also suggested. The Mycenaean period became the historical setting of much ancient Greek literature and mythology, including the Trojan Epic Cycle.The extent to which Homer attempted to or succeeded in recreating a \\"Mycenaean\\" setting is examined in Moses I. Finley The World of Odysseus, 1954. Chronology The Lion Gate, the main entrance of the citadel of Mycenae, 13th century BC The Bronze Age in mainland Greece is generally termed as the \\"Helladic period\\" by modern archaeologists, after Hellas, the Greek name for Greece. This period is divided into three subperiods: The Early Helladic (EH) period (c. 2900‚Äì2000 BC) was a time of prosperity with the use of metals and a growth in technology, economy and social organization. The Middle Helladic (MH) period (c. 2000‚Äì1650 BC) faced a slower pace of development, as well as the evolution of megaron-type dwellings and cist grave burials. Finally, the Late Helladic (LH) period (c. 1650‚Äì1050 BC) roughly coincides with Mycenaean Greece. The Late Helladic period is further divided into LHI and LHII, both of which coincide with the early period of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1650‚Äì1425 BC), and LHIII (c. 1425‚Äì1050 BC), the period of expansion, decline and collapse of the Mycenaean civilization. The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (c. 1050‚Äì1000 BC). Identity The decipherment of the Mycenaean Linear B script, a writing system adapted for the use of the (Indo-European) Greek language of the Late Bronze Age,. demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new Phoenician-derived alphabetic script emerged.. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period.. Lastly, the decipherment marked the advent of an Indo-European language in the Aegean region in contrast to unrelated prior languages spoken in adjoining areas.. Various collective terms for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th-century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War,. supposed to have happened in the late 13thearly 12th century BC when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae besieged the walled city of Troy. Warrior wearing a boar tusk helmet, from a Mycenaean chamber tomb in the Acropolis of Athens, 14th‚Äì13th century BC. Homer interchangeably used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives to refer to the besiegers, and these names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as collective terms in his Iliad.. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi- ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.. Egyptian records mention a T(D)-n-j or Danaya (Tanaju) land for the first time c. 1437 BC, during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmoses III (r. 1479‚Äì1425 BC). This land is geographically defined in an inscription from the reign of Amenhotep III (r. circa 1390‚Äì1352 BC), where a number of Danaya cities are mentioned, which cover the largest part of southern mainland Greece.. Among them, cities such as Mycenae, Nauplion and Thebes have been identified with certainty. Danaya has been equated with the ethnonym Danaoi (), the name of the mythical dynasty that ruled in the region of Argos, also used as an ethnonym for the Greek people by Homer.; . In the official records of another Bronze Age empire, that of the Hittites in Anatolia, various references from c. 1400 BC to 1220 BC mention a country named Ahhiyawa.. Recent scholarship, based on textual evidence, new interpretations of the Hittite inscriptions, and recent surveys of archaeological evidence about Mycenaean‚ÄìAnatolian contacts during this period, concludes that the term Ahhiyawa must have been used in reference to the Mycenaean world (land of the Achaeans), or at least to a part of it... This term may have also had broader connotations in some texts, possibly referring to all regions settled by Mycenaeans or regions under direct Mycenaean political control.. Another similar ethnonym, Ekwesh, in twelfth century BC Egyptian inscriptions has been commonly identified with the Ahhiyawans. These Ekwesh were mentioned as a group of the Sea People.. History Shaft grave era (c. 1600‚Äì1450 BC) Death mask, known as the Mask of Agamemnon, Grave Circle A, Mycenae, 16th century BC, probably the most famous artifact of Mycenaean Greece. Scholars have proposed different theories on the origins of the Mycenaeans. According to one theory, Mycenaean civilization reflected the exogenous imposition of archaic Indo-Europeans from the Eurasian steppe onto the pre-Mycenaean local population. An issue with this theory, however, entails the very tenuous material and cultural relationship between Aegean and northern steppe populations during the Bronze Age. Another theory proposes that Mycenaean culture in Greece dates back to circa 3000 BC with Indo-European migrants entering a mainly depopulated area; other hypotheses argue for a date as early as the seventh millennium BC (with the spread of agriculture) and as late as 1600 BC (with the spread of chariot technology). In a 2017 genetic study conducted by Lazaridis et al., \\"the Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar [but] the Mycenaeans differed from Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the hunter‚Äìgatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia.\\" However, Lazaridis et al. admit that their research \\"does not settle th[e] debate\\" on Mycenaean origins. Historian Bernard Sergent notes that archeology alone is not able to settle the debate, and that the majority of Hellenists believed Mycenaeans spoke a non-Indo-European, Minoan language before Linear B was deciphered in 1952. Notwithstanding the above academic disputes, the mainstream consensus among modern Mycenologists is that Mycenaean civilization, exemplified in the Shaft Graves, originated and evolved from the local socio-cultural landscape of the Early and Middle Bronze Age in mainland Greece with influences from Minoan Crete.; . Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1600 BC) a significant increase in the population and the number of settlements occurred. A number of centers of power emerged in southern mainland Greece dominated by a warrior elite society, while the typical dwellings of that era were an early type of megaron buildings. Some more complex structures are classified as forerunners of the later palaces. In a number of sites, defensive walls were also erected.. Meanwhile, new types of burials and more imposing ones have been unearthed, which display a great variety of luxurious objects.. Among the various burial types, the shaft grave became the most common form of elite burial, a feature that gave the name to the early period of Mycenaean Greece.. Among the Mycenaean elite, deceased men were usually laid to rest in gold masks and funerary armor, and women in gold crowns and clothes gleaming with gold ornaments.. The royal shaft graves next to the acropolis of Mycenae, in particular the Grave Circles A and B signified the elevation of a native Greek-speaking royal dynasty whose economic power depended on long-distance sea trade.; . During this period, the Mycenaean centers witnessed increased contacts with the outside world and especially with the Cyclades and the Minoan centers in the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare.. In the early 15th century BC, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.. At the end of the Shaft Grave era, a new and more imposing type of elite burial emerged, the tholos: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.; . Koine era (c. 1450 BC‚Äì1250 BC) Fresco depicting a female figure in the acropolis of Mycenae, 13th century BC The eruption of Thera, which according to archaeological data occurred in c. 1500 BC, resulted in the decline of the Minoan civilization of Crete.. This turn of events gave the opportunity to the Mycenaeans to spread their influence throughout the Aegean. Around c. 1450 BC, they were in control of Crete itself, including Knossos, and colonized several other Aegean islands, reaching as far as Rhodes.. Thus the Mycenaeans became the dominant power of the region, marking the beginning of the Mycenaean 'Koine' era (from , common), a highly uniform culture that spread in mainland Greece and the Aegean.. From the early 14th century BC, Mycenaean trade began to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities in the Mediterranean after the Minoan collapse.. The trade routes were expanded further, reaching Cyprus, Amman in the Near East, Apulia in Italy and Spain. From that time period (c. 1400 BC), the palace of Knossos has yielded the earliest records of the Greek Linear B script, based on the previous Linear A of the Minoans. The use of the new script spread in mainland Greece and offers valuable insight into the administrative network of the palatial centers. However, the unearthed records are too fragmentary for a political reconstruction of Bronze Age Greece. panoply, found in Dendra, Argolid, 1400 BC Excavations at Miletus, southwest Asia Minor, indicate the existence of a Mycenaean settlement there already from c. 1450 BC, replacing the previous Minoan installations.. This site became a sizable and prosperous Mycenaean center until the 12th century BC.. Apart from the archaeological evidence, this is also attested in Hittite records, which indicate that Miletos (Milawata in Hittite) was the most important base for Mycenaean activity in Asia Minor.. Mycenaean presence also reached the adjacent sites of Iasus and Ephesus. Meanwhile, imposing palaces were built in the main Mycenaean centers of the mainland. The earliest palace structures were megaron-type buildings, such as the Menelaion in Sparta, Lakonia. Palaces proper are datable from c. 1400 BC, when Cyclopean fortifications were erected at Mycenae and nearby Tiryns. Additional palaces were built in Midea and Pylos in Peloponnese, Athens, Eleusis, Thebes and Orchomenos in Central Greece and Iolcos, in Thessaly, the latter being the northernmost Mycenaean center. Knossos in Crete also became a Mycenaean center, where the former Minoan complex underwent a number of adjustments, including the addition of a throne room.. These centers were based on a rigid network of bureaucracy where administrative competencies were classified into various sections and offices according to specialization of work and trades. At the head of this society was the king, known as wanax (Linear B: wa-na-ka) in Mycenaean Greek terms. All powers were vested in him, as the main landlord and spiritual and military leader. At the same time he was an entrepreneur and trader and was aided by a network of high officials.; . Involvement in Asia Minor The presence of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical definition of the term cannot be drawn from the texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level.. Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.; . Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC; Mycenaean Greece in purple In c. 1400 BC, Hittite records mention the military activities of an Ahhiyawan warlord, Attarsiya, a possible Hittite way of writing the Greek name Atreus, who attacked Hittite vassals in western Anatolia.. Later, in c. 1315 BC, an anti-Hittite rebellion headed by Arzawa, a Hittite vassal state, received support from Ahhiyawa.. Meanwhile, Ahhiyawa appears to be in control of a number of islands in the Aegean, an impression also supported by archaeological evidence.. During the reign of the Hittite king Hattusili III (c. 1267‚Äì1237 BC), the king of Ahhiyawa is recognized as a \\"Great King\\" and of equal status with the other contemporary great Bronze Age rulers: the kings of Egypt, Babylonia and Assyria.; . At that time, another anti-Hittite movement, led by Piyama-Radu, broke out and was supported by the king of Ahhiyawa.. Piyama-Radu caused major unrest in the region of Wilusa and later invaded the island of Lesbos, which then passed into Ahhiyawan control.. The Hittite-Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa, the Hittite name for Troy, may provide the historical foundation for the Trojan War tradition.. As a result of this instability, the Hittite king initiated correspondence in order to convince his Ahhiyawan counterpart to restore peace in the region. The Hittite record mentions a certain Tawagalawa, a possible Hittite translation for Greek Eteocles, as brother of the king of Ahhiyawa.. Collapse (c. 1250‚Äì1100 BC) Initial decline and revival Marching soldiers observed by a female figure, in the Warrior Vase, c. 1200 BC, a krater from Mycenae In 1250 BC, the first wave of destruction apparently occurred in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. In Boeotia, Thebes was burned to the ground, around that year or slightly later. Nearby Orchomenos shared the same fate, while the Boeotian fortifications of Gla were deserted.. In the Peloponnese, a number of buildings surrounding the citadel of Mycenae were attacked and burned.. These incidents appear to have prompted the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites. In some cases, arrangements were also made for the creation of subterranean passages which led to underground cisterns. Tiryns, Midea and Athens expanded their defences with new cyclopean-style walls.. The extension program in Mycenae almost doubled the fortified area of the citadel. To this phase of extension belongs the impressive Lion Gate, the main entrance into the Mycenaean acropolis. It appears that after this first wave of destruction a short-lived revival of Mycenaean culture followed. Mycenaean Greece continues to be mentioned in international affairs, particularly in Hittite records. In c. 1220 BC, the king of Ahhiyawa is again reported to have been involved in an anti-Hittite uprising in western Anatolia.. Another contemporary Hittite account reports that Ahhiyawan ships should avoid Assyrian-controlled harbors, as part of a trade embargo imposed on Assyria.. In general, in the second half of 13th century BC, trade was in decline in the Eastern Mediterranean, most probably due to the unstable political environment there.. Final collapse None of the defence measures appear to have prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in c. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event marked the end of Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, was destroyed in c. 1180 BC... The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any detail about the attacking force.. As a result of this turmoil, specific regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the Levantine coast. Nevertheless, other regions on the edge of the Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction. Hypotheses for the collapse Invasions, destructions and possible population movements during the collapse of the Bronze Age, c. 1200 BC The reasons for the end of the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation for the collapse of the Mycenaean palace systems. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict. The first attributes the destruction of Mycenaean sites to invaders.. The hypothesis of a Dorian invasion, known as such in Ancient Greek tradition, that led to the end of Mycenaean Greece, is supported by sporadic archaeological evidence such as new types of burials, in particular cist graves, and the use of a new dialect of Greek, the Doric one. It appears that the Dorians moved southward gradually over a number of years and devastated the territory, until they managed to establish themselves in the Mycenaean centers.. A new type of ceramic also appeared, called \\"Barbarian Ware\\" because it was attributed to invaders from the north. On the other hand, the collapse of Mycenaean Greece coincides with the activity of the Sea Peoples in the Eastern Mediterranean. They caused widespread destruction in Anatolia and the Levant and were finally defeated by Pharaoh Ramesses III in c. 1175 BC. One of the ethnic groups that comprised these people were the Eqwesh, a name that appears to be linked with the Ahhiyawa of the Hittite inscriptions.. Alternative scenarios propose that the fall of Mycenaean Greece was a result of internal disturbances which led to internecine warfare among the Mycenaean states or civil unrest in a number of states, as a result of the strict hierarchical social system and the ideology of the wanax. In general, due to the obscure archaeological picture in 12th‚Äì11th century BC Greece, there is a continuing controversy among scholars over whether the impoverished societies that succeeded the Mycenaean palatial states were newcomers or populations that already resided in Mycenaean Greece. Recent archaeological findings tend to favor the latter scenario. Additional theories, concerning natural factors, such as climate change, droughts or earthquakes have also been proposed.. Another theory considers the decline of the Mycenaean civilization as a manifestation of a common pattern for the decline of many ancient civilizations: the Minoan, the Harrapan and the Western Roman Empire; the reason for the decline is migration due to overpopulation.. The period following the end of Mycenaean Greece, c. 1100‚Äì800 BC, is generally termed the \\"Greek Dark Ages\\".. Political organization Reconstruction of the political landscape in c. 1400‚Äì1250 BC mainland southern Greece Palatial states Mycenaean palatial states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, are recorded in ancient Greek literature and mythology (e.g., Iliad, Catalogue of Ships) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over most, if not all, industries within its realm. The palatial territory was divided into several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center. Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the da-mo. A number of palaces and fortifications appear to be part of a wider kingdom. For instance, Gla, located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos. Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to three times the size of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including Tiryns and Nauplion, which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae's ruling dynasty.. The unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape in Mycenaean Greece and they do not support the existence of a larger Mycenaean state... On the other hand, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a \\"Great King\\".. Alternatively, based on archaeological data, some sort of confederation among a number of palatial states appears to be possible. If some kind of united political entity existed, the dominant center was probably located in Thebes or in Mycenae, with the latter state being the most probable center of power.. Society and administration The Neolithic agrarian village (6000 BC) constituted the foundation of Bronze Age political culture in Greece.. The vast majority of the preserved Linear B records deal with administrative issues and give the impression that Mycenaean palatial administration was highly uniform with the use of the same language, terminology, system of taxation and distribution... Considering this sense of uniformity, the Pylos archive, which is the best preserved one in the Mycenaean world, is generally taken as a representative one. The state was ruled by a king, the wanax (œùŒ¨ŒΩŒ±Œæ), whose role was religious and perhaps also military and judicial.. The wanax oversaw virtually all aspects of palatial life, from religious feasting and offerings to the distribution of goods, craftsmen and troops.. Under him was the lƒÅwƒÅgetas (\\"the leader of the people\\"), whose role appears mainly religious. His activities possibly overlap with the wanax and is usually seen as the second-in-command. Both wanax and lƒÅwƒÅgetas were at the head of a military aristocracy known as the eqeta (\\"companions\\" or \\"followers\\"). The land possessed by the wanax is usually the t√©menos (te-me-no). There is also at least one instance of a person, Enkhelyawon, at Pylos, who appears titleless in the written record but whom modern scholars regard as probably a king., pp. 71‚Äì72. A number of local officials positioned by the wanax appear to be in charge of the districts, such as ko-re-te (koreter, '\\"governor\\"), po-ro-ko-re-te (prokoreter, \\"deputy\\") and the da-mo-ko-ro (damokoros, \\"one who takes care of a damos\\"), the latter probably being appointed to take charge of the commune. A council of elders was chaired, the ke-ro-si-ja (cf. Œ≥ŒµœÅŒøœÖœÉŒØŒ±, gerous√≠a). The basileus, who in latter Greek society was the name of the king, refers to communal officials. In general, Mycenaean society appears to have been divided into two groups of free men: the king's entourage, who conducted administrative duties at the palace, and the people, da-mo. These last were watched over by royal agents and were obliged to perform duties for and pay taxes to the palace. Among those who could be found in the palace were well-to-do high officials, who probably lived in the vast residences found in proximity to Mycenaean palaces, but also others, tied by their work to the palace and not necessarily better off than the members of the da-mo, such as craftsmen, farmers, and perhaps merchants. Occupying a lower rung of the social ladder were the slaves, do-e- ro, (cf. , do√∫los). These are recorded in the texts as working either for the palace or for specific deities. Economy Mycenaean palace amphora, found in the Argolid Mycenaean stirrup vase found in the acropolis of Ugarit, Eastern Mediterranean (c. 1400‚Äì1300 BC) Organization The Mycenaean economy, given its pre-monetary nature, was focused on the redistribution of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel.. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods... For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000‚Äì100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.. Nevertheless, palatial control over resources appears to have been highly selective in spatial terms and in terms of how different industries were managed.. Thus, sectors like the production of perfumed oil and bronze materials were directly monitored from the palace, but the production of ceramics was only indirectly monitored.. Regional transactions between the palaces are also recorded on a few occasions.. Large-scale infrastructure The palatial centers organized their workforce and resources for the construction of large scale projects in the fields of agriculture and industry. The magnitude of some projects indicates that this was the result of combined efforts from multiple palatial centers. Most notable of them are the drainage system of the Kopais basin in Boeotia, the building of a large dam outside Tiryns, and the drainage of the swamp in the Nemea valley.. Also noticeable is the construction of harbors, such as the harbor of Pylos, that were capable of accommodating large Bronze Age era vessels like the one found at Uluburun. The Mycenaean economy also featured large-scale manufacturing as testified by the extent of workshop complexes that have been discovered, the largest known to date being the recent ceramic and hydraulic installations found in Euonymeia, next to Athens, that produced tableware, textiles, sails, and ropes for export and shipbuilding. The most famous project of the Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have facilitated the speedy deployment of troops‚Äîfor example, the remnants of a Mycenaean road, along with what appears to have been a Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.. Trade Gold earring, c. 1600 BC, Louvre Museum Reconstruction of a Mycenaean ship Trade over vast areas of the Mediterranean was essential for the economy of Mycenaean Greece. The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from these materials, in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, wool and pottery.. International trade of that time was not only conducted by palatial emissaries but also by independent merchants. Based on archaeological findings in the Middle East, in particular physical artifacts, textual references, inscriptions and wall paintings, it appears that Mycenaean Greeks achieved strong commercial and cultural interaction with most of the Bronze Age people living in this region: Canaanites, Kassites, Mitanni, Assyrians, and Egyptians.... The 14th century Uluburun shipwreck, off the coast of southern Anatolia, displays the established trade routes that supplied the Mycenaeans with all the raw materials and items that the economy of Mycenaean Greece needed, such as copper and tin for the production of bronze products.. A chief export of the Mycenaeans was olive oil, which was a multi-purpose product. Cyprus appears to be the principal intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there.; ; ; . On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited.. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea.. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.Boston University ‚Äì The Historical Society. Commercial interaction was also intense with the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to southern Italy, Sicily and the Aeolian islands. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into Sardinia,; ; ; .; ; ; ; ; ; . as well as southern Spain.; ; . Sporadic objects of Mycenaean manufacture were found in various distant locations, like in Central Europe,. such as in Bavaria, Germany, where an amber object inscribed with Linear B symbols has been unearthed. Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects dating from the 13th century BC have been found in Ireland and in Wessex and Cornwall in England.. Religion The Lady of Phylakopi; wheel-made pottery figurine of a goddess or priestess from the West Shrine in Phylakopi; late Helladic III A period, 14th century BC, Archaeological Museum of Milos Temples and shrines are strangely rare in the Mycenaean archaeological sites. Monumental cultic structures are absent at all the palatial centers, with the exception of Mycenae. However, the cultic center of Mycenae seems to have been a later (13th century BC) development. Small shrines have been identified in Asine, Berbati, Malthi and Pylos,. while a number of sacred enclosures have been located near Mycenae, Delphi and Amyklae.. Linear B records mention a number of sanctuaries dedicated to a variety of deities, at least in Pylos and Knossos. They also indicate that there were various religious festivities including offerings.. Written Mycenaean records mention various priests and priestesses who were responsible for specific shrines and temples.. The latter were prominent figures in society, and the role of Mycenaean women in religious festivities was also important, just as in Minoan Crete.. The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, although it is difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods.. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.. Poseidon (Linear B: Po-se- da-o) seems to have occupied a place of privilege. He was a chthonic deity, connected with earthquakes (E-ne-si-da-o-ne: Earth-shaker), but it seems that he also represented the river spirit of the underworld.. Paean (Pa-ja-wo) is probably the precursor of the Greek physician of the gods in Homer's Iliad. He was the personification of the magic-song which was supposed to \\"heal\\" the patient.; A number of divinities have been identified in the Mycenaean scripts only by their epithets used during later antiquity. For example, Qo- wi-ja (\\"cow-eyed\\") is a standard Homeric ephithet of Hera. Ares appeared under the name Enyalios (assuming that Enyalios is not a separate god).. Additional divinities that can be also found in later periods include Hephaestus, Erinya, Artemis (a-te-mi-to and a-ti-mi-te) and Dionysos (Di-wo-nu-so)....Kn V 52 (text 208 in Ventris and Chadwick); . Zeus also appears in the Mycenaean pantheon, but he was certainly not the chief deity. A collection of \\"ladies\\" or \\"mistresses\\", Po-ti-ni-ja (Potnia) are named in the Mycenaean scripts. As such, Athena (A-ta-na) appears in an inscription at Knossos as mistress Athena, similar to a later Homeric expression, but in the Pylos tablets she is mentioned without any accompanying word. Si-to po-ti-ni-ja appears to be an agricultural goddess, possibly related to Demeter of later antiquity, while in Knossos there is the \\"mistress of the Labyrinth\\".. The \\"two queens and the king\\" (wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te) are mentioned in Pylos.. Goddess Pe-re-swa mentioned may be related to Persephone.. A number of Mycenaean divinities seem to have no later equivalents, such as Marineus, Diwia and Komawenteia. Women Daily life Mycenaean beads used for a necklace. By observing Mycenaean wall paintings, scholars have deduced that women during this time often wore long dresses, their hair long, and wore jewelry, most notably beads. Mycenaean beads have long been an aspect of Mycenaean culture that is shrouded in a significant amount of mystery. It is not known for certain why they (men, women, and children) wore them, or why they appear to have been significant to the culture, but beads made of carnelian, lapis lazuli, etc., were known to have been worn by women on bracelets, necklaces, and buttons on cloaks, and were often buried with the deceased.. In later periods of Greek history, seclusion of females from males was common in the household, though scholars have found no evidence of seclusion during Mycenaean times, and believe that males and females worked with and around each other on a regular basis. Not much is known about women's duties in the home or whether they differed from the duties of men. And though men were involved in warfare and hunting, there is no evidence that suggests women ever took part in either of the two, though whether women took part in hunting has been up for debate amongst some historians. There is evidence that, in this patriarchal society, men and women were, in some respects, viewed equally. Mycenae practiced a system of rationing food to citizens, and evidence shows that women received the same amount of rations as men.. If women were not officials in the cult or married to high-ranking male officers, they were likely low-ranking laborers. Linear B details specialized groups of female laborers called ‚Äúworkgroups.‚Äù These women labored with other women as well as their children, and usually were located close to the palace. Women who belonged to workgroups did not belong to independent households, but were managed and fed by palace scribes. All of the women in a workgroup would serve the same occupation, such as textiles. Women in workgroups are not believed to have been able to acquire land holdings or have had economic independence of any kind, and are believed by some to have been slaves, though there are some conflicting debates among scholars concerning this. Though scholars are unsure if ordinary women could obtain land and exert economic power, there is evidence that women could obtain positions of power, such as the title of priestess, which allowed them to have land holdings, have elite connections, and high social status. Mycenaean society is believed to have been largely patriarchal, but women could exert social and economic power through titles and positions of power, like that of a priestess, though religion was not the only place that a woman could gain social authority.. Women with special talents or skills, such as being a skilled midwife or craftswomen, could gain social authority in their villages, but are not believed to have been able to receive land holdings. Elite women (those who were married to male elites) were afforded benefits fitting their high social standing, but even the wife of elites could not own land and had no economic independence.. Some scholars believe that Knossos was probably more equal in relation to gender than Pylos, though the evidence for this is little and is highly disputed.. Religion Men and women alike were involved in cult activity. Some women could be elevated to becoming legally independent by becoming priestesses, which appears to be hereditary through both the male and female line. No woman in Mycenae is believed to have been able to ‚Äúown‚Äù land at this time, but priestesses were women who could legally procure land. Through the cult, land was \\"leased\\" to them, rather than given to them in ownership. Along with land holding benefits, priestesses often had ties with the upper-class elites, and were usually wealthy themselves. Only a small number of women could become priestesses in Mycenae, but there were other cultic titles that women could aspire to obtain, such as that of Key-bearer. Key-bearers appear to be women who had authority over the sacred treasury of a particular deity, and were able to dispense it in times of need. Though scholars do not have enough evidence to suggest that all Key- bearers could own land and had high status, there is a written record in Linear B of a Key-bearer with elite ties who owned land, so it is possible that they had similar benefits to priestesses. Other religious roles filled by women were the three types of sacred slaves: slave of the God, slave of the Priestess, and slave of the Key-bearer. Though not as grand a title as that of Priestess of Key-Bearer, the sacred slaves were allotted certain benefits fitting their positions in the cult. One other documented position women filled in the cult was called ki-ri-te-wi-ja. Though documented, scholars are not certain exactly what the duties of this role entailed, or what type of women would have filled it. What they do know, however, is that these religious roles afforded the women who occupied them a certain amount of economic autonomy. Architecture Palaces Tiryns, map of the palace and the surrounding fortifications The palatial structures at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos were erected on the summits of hills or rocky outcrops, dominating the immediate surroundings. The best preserved are found in Pylos and Tiryns, while Mycenae and the Menelaion are only partially preserved. In Central Greece, Thebes and Orchomenos have been only partially exposed. On the other hand, the palace built at the acropolis of Athens has been almost completely destroyed. A substantial building at Dimini in Thessaly, possibly ancient Iolcos, is believed by a number of archaeologists to be a palace. A Mycenaean palace has been also unearthed in Laconia, near the modern village of Xirokambi. The hearth of the megaron of Pylos The palatial structures of mainland Greece share a number of common features. The focal point of the socio-political aspect of a Mycenaean palace was the megaron, the throne room. It was laid out around a circular hearth surrounded by four columns. The throne was generally found on the right-hand side upon entering the room, while the interior of the megaron was lavishly decorated, flaunting images designed intentionally to demonstrate the political and religious power of the ruler. Access to the megaron was provided through a court, which was reached from a propylon. The iconography of the palatial chambers is remarkably uniform throughout Greece. For instance, in Pylos and Tiryns the paintings are focused on marine motifs, providing depictions of octopodes, fish and dolphins. Around the megaron a group of courtyards each opened upon several rooms of different dimensions, such as storerooms and workshops, as well as reception halls and living quarters. In general Mycenaean palaces have yielded a wealth of artifacts and fragmentary frescoes. Additional common features are shared by the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies directly in front of the central megaron,. while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters of the members of the royal family were presumably located on the second floor. Fortifications Cyclopean masonry in the southern walls of Mycenae The construction of defensive structures was closely linked to the establishment of the palaces in mainland Greece. The principal Mycenaean centers were well-fortified and usually situated on an elevated terrain, like on the acropolis of Athens, Tiryns and Mycenae or on coastal plains, in the case of Gla. Mycenaean Greeks in general appreciated the symbolism of war as expressed in defensive architecture, reflected by the visual impressiveness of their fortifications. Part of the galleries within the walls of Tiryns Cyclopean is the term normally applied to the masonry characteristics of Mycenaean fortification systems and describes walls built of large, unworked boulders more than thick and weighing several metric tonnes.. They were roughly fitted together without the use of mortar or clay to bind them, though smaller hunks of limestone fill the interstices. Their placement formed a polygonal pattern giving the curtain wall an irregular but imposing appearance. At the top it would have been wide enough for a walkway with a narrow protective parapet on the outer edge and with hoop-like crenellations.. The term Cyclopean was derived by the latter Greeks of the Classical era who believed that only the mythical giants, the Cyclopes, could have constructed such megalithic structures. On the other hand, cut stone masonry is used only in and around gateways. Another typical feature of Mycenaean megalithic construction was the use of a relieving triangle above a lintel block‚Äîan opening, often triangular, designed to reduce the weight over the lintel. The space was filled with some lighter stone. Cyclopean fortifications were typical of Mycenaean walls, especially at the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, Argos, Crisa and Athens, while smaller boulders are found in Midea and large limestone slabs are found at Gla. In the Mycenaean settlements found in Epirus and Cyprus, Cyclopean-style walls are also present,: \\"In LH IBBB (ca. 1310-1190), Mycenaean material culture spread widely throughout coastal and inland Epirus; in this period Mycenaean engagement in Epirus was strongest, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Though the Kiperi tholos may have gone out of use early in LH IIIB, the Cyclopean wall found there, as well as those at Ephyra, Kastriza, and Ayia Eleni, cannot have been built (and probably after) LH IIIB.\\". Iacovou quotes Vassos Karageorghis who states that \\"The introduction of 'Cyclopean'-type walls at the very beginning of the LC IIIA period at Enkomi, Kition, Sinda and Maa-Palaeokastron was due to the arrival of Mycenaean settlers in Cyprus.\\" as well as in western Anatolia.. Besides the citadels, isolated forts were also erected on various strategic locations. The fortification systems also incorporated technical refinements such as secret cisterns, galleries, sally ports and projecting bastions for the protection of gateways.. On the other hand, the palace of Pylos, although a major center of power, paradoxically appears to have been left without any defensive walls.. Other architectural features Mycenaean domestic architecture originates mainly from earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000‚Äì1650 BC) both in shape, as well as in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably as a result of a shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland rather than as a consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine.. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings. Contrary to popular belief, some Mycenaean representative buildings already featured roofs made of fired tiles, as in Gla and Midea.; . Warfare The military nature of the Mycenaean Greeks is evident from the numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records... The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers.. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.. Replicas of Mycenaean swords and cups Mycenaean armies were initially based on heavy infantry, equipped with spears, large shields and in some occasion armor.. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.. Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins.; . The precise role and contribution of chariots on the battlefield is a matter of dispute due to the lack of sufficient evidence.. It appears that chariots were initially used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.. The boar's tusk helmet was the most identifiable piece of Mycenaean armor in use from the beginning to the collapse of Mycenaean culture. It is also known from several depictions in contemporary art in Greece and the Mediterranean... A representative piece of Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450‚Äì1400 BC) which consisted of a cuirass of a complete set of armor made up of several elements of bronze.. In general, most features of the later hoplite panoply of classical Greek antiquity, were already known to Mycenaean Greece. \\"Figure-of- eight\\" shields were the most common type of Mycenaean shields.. During the Late Mycenaean period, smaller types of shields were adopted, either of completely circular shape, or almost circular with a part cut out from their lower edge.; . Art and pottery Metalwork Several important pieces in gold and other metals come from the Gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae, including the Mask of Agamemnon, Silver Siege Rhyton, Bulls-head rhyton, and gold Nestor's Cup. The Theseus Ring, found in Athens, is one of the finest of a number of gold signet rings with tiny multi-figure scenes of high quality, many from the princely Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae. Vessels Silver repouss√© rhyton with gold horns, from Grave Circle A at Mycenae, 16th century BC (Archaeological Museum, Athens) During the Late Mycenaean period (1400‚Äì1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery exhibited similarities spanning a significant area of the Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form of economic and political union centered at Mycenae.. However, the pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island. The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as stirrup jars, large bowls, alabastron, krater and stemmed cups (or kylikes) resembling champagne glasses. Stirrup jars (Linear B: ka-ra-re-u, khlareus; \\"oil vessel\\"), specifically, were first invented on the island of Crete during the 16th century BC and used widely by the Mycenaeans from 1400 BC onward for transporting and storing wine and oil; the jars were usually pear-shaped or globular. As for stemmed cups (or kylikes), they evolved from Ephyraean goblets and a large quantity was discovered at a site called the \\"Potter's Shop\\" located in Zygouries. Mycenaean drinking vessels such as the stemmed cups contained single decorative motifs such as a shell, an octopus or a flower painted on the side facing away from the drinker. The Mycenaean Greeks also painted entire scenes (called \\"Pictorial Style\\") on their vessels depicting warriors, chariots, horses and deities reminiscent of events described in Homer's Iliad. Other items developed by the Mycenaeans include clay lamps, as well as metallic vessels such as bronze tripod cauldrons (or basins).. A few examples of vessels in faience and ivory are also known.. Figures and figurines The Mycenaean period has not yielded sculpture of any great size. The statuary of the period consists for the most part of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece‚Äîin tombs, in settlement debris, and occasionally in cult contexts (Tiryns, Agios Konstantinos on Methana). The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups which were popular at different periods, as Psi and phi type figurines, the Tau-type. The earliest are the Phi-type, which look like the Greek letter phi and their arms give the upper body of the figurine a rounded shape. The Psi-type looks like the letter Greek psi: these have outstretched upraised arms. The latest (12th century BC) are the Tau- type: these figurines look like the Greek letter tau with folded(?) arms at right angles to the body. Most figurines wear a large 'polos' hat.. They are painted with stripes or zigzags in the same manner as the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters. Their purpose is uncertain, but they may have served as both votive objects and toys: some are found in children's graves but the vast majority of fragments are from domestic rubbish deposits.See account of their use in K.A. and Diana Wardle \\"The Child's Cache at Assiros, Macedonia\\", in Sally Crawford and Gillian Shepherd (eds): Children, Childhood and Society: Institute for Archaeology and Antiquity Interdisciplinary Studies (Volume I) Oxford: Archaeopress, 2007. The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods (approximately 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi, others at the temple of Aphaea on Aegina, at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyklae near Sparta), suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature, perhaps as votives, but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period. Larger male, female or bovine terracotta wheelmade figures are much rarer. An important group was found in the Temple at Mycenae together with coiled clay snakes, while others have been found at Tiryns and in the East and West Shrines at Phylakopi on the island of Melos. Frescoes Fresco of a Mycenaean woman The painting of the Mycenaean age was much influenced by that of the Minoan age. Fragments of wall paintings have been found in or around the palaces (Pylos, Mycenae, Tiryns) and in domestic contexts (Zygouries).. The largest complete wall painting depicting three female figures, probably goddesses, was found in the so-called \\"cult center\\" at Mycenae.; . Various themes are represented: hunting, bull leaping (tauromachy), battle scenes, processions, etc. Some scenes may be part of mythological narratives, but if so their meaning eludes us. Other frescoes include geometric or stylised motifs, also used on painted pottery (see above). Burial practices The usual form of burial during this period was inhumation (burial in the earth, covered by dirt and stones).. The earliest Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves in the form of a pit or a stone-lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery.; . Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic.. It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture;. however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with the Shaft Graves housing native rulers.. Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves.. The shaft graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.; . Beginning also in the Late Helladic period are to be seen communal tombs of rectangular form. Nevertheless, it is difficult to establish whether the different forms of burial represent a social hierarchization, as was formerly thought, with the \\"tholos\\" being the tombs of the elite rulers, the individual tombs those of the leisure class, and the communal tombs those of the people. Cremations increased in number over the course of the period, becoming quite numerous in the last phase of the Mycenaean era.. The tholos was introduced during the early 15th century as the new and more imposing form of elite burial.. The most impressive tombs of the Mycenaean era are the monumental royal tombs of Mycenae, undoubtedly intended for the royal family of the city. The most famous is the Treasury of Atreus, a tholos. A total of nine of such tholos tombs are found in the region of Mycenae, while six of them belong to a single period (Late Helladic IIa, c. 1400‚Äì1300 BC).. It has been argued that different dynasties or factions may have competed through conspicuous burial.. Cuisine With respect to Mycenaean cuisine, \\"souvlaki trays\\" were discovered in Gla, Mycenae, and Pylos.. The \\"souvlaki trays\\" (or portable grills) used by the Mycenaean Greeks were rectangular ceramic pans that sat underneath skewers of meat. It is not clear whether these trays would have been placed directly over a fire or if the pans would have held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit. Writing Linear B tablets (Mycenaean Greek) In circa 1600 BC, the Mycenaean Greeks borrowed from the Minoan civilization its syllabic writing system (i.e., Linear A) and developed their own syllabic script known as Linear B. The Linear B script was utilized by the Mycenaean palaces in Greece for administrative purposes where economic transactions were recorded on clay tablets and some pottery in the Mycenaean dialect of the Greek language. The Linear B tablets were first discovered in Crete by English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans c. 1900 and later deciphered by English architect and cryptographer Michael Ventris in 1952. Ventris's discovery of an archaic Greek dialect in the Linear B tablets demonstrated that Mycenaean Greek was \\"the oldest known Greek dialect, elements of which survived in Homer‚Äôs language as a result of a long oral tradition of epic poetry.\\" Legacy In the 8th century BC, after the end of the so-called Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle.. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth.. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876.. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.. Moreover, the language of the Mycenaeans offers the first written evidence of Greek,. while a significant part of the Mycenaean vocabulary can also be found in modern English. The Mycenaean Greeks were also pioneers in the field of engineering, launching large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe.. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods, so it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization. Genetic studies In their archaeogenetics study, Lazaridis et al. (2017) concluded that the Mycenaean Greeks were genetically closely related with the Minoans, and that both are closely related, but not identical, to modern Greek populations.. The same study also stated that at least three-quarters of DNA of both the Mycenaeans and the Minoans came from the first Neolithic-era farmers that lived in Western Anatolia and the Aegean Sea (Mycenaeans ~74‚Äì78%, Minoans ~84‚Äì85%) while most of the remainder came from ancient populations related to the Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers and Neolithic Iran (Mycenaeans ~8‚Äì17%, Minoans ~14‚Äì15%). Unlike the Minoans, the Mycenaeans had also inherited \\"~4-16% ancestry from a 'northern' ultimate source related to the hunter-gatherers of Eastern Europe and [Upper Palaeolithic] Siberia\\", \\"introduced via a proximal source related to either the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia.\\"Lazaridis, Iosif et al. \\"Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans\\". Nature, 2017 (Supplementary Information, \\"Mycenaeans\\", pp. 35‚Äì36). Though the former scenario (Eurasian steppe) seems more likely when we consider that the autosomal model sharing the most drift with the Mycenaeans is the one composed of 79% Minoan_Lasithi and 21% Europe_LNBA, as described in the Supplementary Information (section 2) of the study.Lazaridis, Iosif et al. \\"Genetic origins of the Minoans and Mycenaeans\\". Nature, 2017 (Supplementary Information, \\"Admixture simulations\\", pp. 47). Among the Mycenaeans, one male sample was found to belong to Y-DNA J2a1 and mtDNA X2, while three female samples to mtDNA X2, X2d and H respectively.

This culminated at the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC, a crushing Roman victory in the Peloponnese that led to the destruction of Corinth and ushered in the period of Roman Greece. Hellenistic Greece's definitive end was with the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, when the future emperor Augustus defeated Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony, the next year taking over Alexandria, the last great center of Hellenistic Greece.Hellenistic Age. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2013. Retrieved 27 May 2013. Archived here. The Hellenistic period began with the wars of the Diadochi, armed contests among the former generals of Alexander the Great to carve up his empire in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The wars lasted until 275 BC, witnessing the fall of both the Argead and Antipatrid dynasties of Macedonia in favor of the Antigonid dynasty. The era was also marked by successive wars between the Kingdom of Macedonia and its allies against the Aetolian League, Achaean League, and the city-state of Sparta. During the reign of Philip V of Macedon (r. 221-179 BC), the Macedonians not only lost the Cretan War (205-200 BC) to an alliance led by Rhodes, but their erstwhile alliance with Hannibal of Carthage also entangled them in the First and Second Macedonian War with ancient Rome. The perceived weakness of Macedonia in the aftermath of these conflicts encouraged Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire to invade mainland Greece, yet his defeat by the Romans at Thermopylae in 191 BC and Magnesia in 190 BC secured Rome's position as the leading military power in the region. Within roughly two decades after conquering Macedonia in 168 BC and Epirus in 167 BC, the Romans would eventually control the whole of Greece. During the Hellenistic period the importance of Greece proper within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centers of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria respectively. Cities such as Pergamon, Ephesus, Rhodes and Seleucia were also important, and increasing urbanisation of the Eastern Mediterranean was characteristic of the time. Macedon Coin depicting Cassander, first post- Argead leader of Hellenistic Greece and founder of Thessaloniki The quests of Alexander had a number of consequences for the Greek city-states. It greatly widened the horizons of the Greeks, making the endless conflicts between the cities which had marked the 5th and 4th centuries BC seem petty and unimportant. It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander's wake, as far away as what are now Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom survived until the end of the 1st century BC. The defeat of the Greek cities by Philip and Alexander also taught the Greeks that their city-states could never again be powers in their own right, and that the hegemony of Macedon and its successor states could not be challenged unless the city states united, or at least federated. The Greeks valued their local independence too much to consider actual unification, but they made several attempts to form federations through which they could hope to reassert their independence. Following Alexander's death a struggle for power broke out among his generals, which resulted in the break- up of his empire and the establishment of a number of new kingdoms. Macedon fell to Cassander, son of Alexander's leading general Antipater, who after several years of warfare made himself master of most of the rest of Greece. He founded a new Macedonian capital at Thessaloniki and was generally a constructive ruler. Cassander's power was challenged by Antigonus, ruler of Anatolia, who promised the Greek cities that he would restore their freedom if they supported him. This led to successful revolts against Cassander's local rulers. In 307 BC, Antigonus's son Demetrius captured Athens and restored its democratic system, which had been suppressed by Alexander. But in 301 BC a coalition of Cassander and the other Hellenistic kings defeated Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus, ending his challenge. Hellenistic Greek tomb door bas relief, Leeds City Museum. After Cassander's death in 298 BC, however, Demetrius seized the Macedonian throne and gained control of most of Greece. He was defeated by a second coalition of Greek rulers in 285 BC, and mastery of Greece passed to the king Lysimachus of Thrace. Lysimachus was in turn defeated and killed in 280 BC. The Macedonian throne then passed to Demetrius's son Antigonus II, who also defeated an invasion of the Greek lands by the Gauls, who at this time were living in the Balkans. The battle against the Gauls united the Antigonids of Macedon and the Seleucids of Antioch, an alliance which was also directed against the wealthiest Hellenistic power, the Ptolemies of Egypt. Antigonus II ruled until his death in 239 BC, and his family retained the Macedonian throne until it was abolished by the Romans in 146 BC. Their control over the Greek city states was intermittent, however, since other rulers, particularly the Ptolemies, subsidised anti-Macedonian parties in Greece to undermine the Antigonids' power. Antigonus placed a garrison at Corinth, the strategic centre of Greece, but Athens, Rhodes, Pergamum and other Greek states retained substantial independence, and formed the Aetolian League as a means of defending it. Sparta also remained independent, but generally refused to join any league. In 267 BC, Ptolemy II persuaded the Greek cities to revolt against Antigonus, in what became the Chremonidian War, after the Athenian leader Chremonides. The cities were defeated and Athens lost her independence and her democratic institutions. The Aetolian League was restricted to the Peloponnese, but on being allowed to gain control of Thebes in 245 BC became a Macedonian ally. This marked the end of Athens as a political actor, although it remained the largest, wealthiest and most cultivated city in Greece. In 255 BC, Antigonus defeated the Egyptian fleet at Cos and brought the Aegean islands, except Rhodes, under his rule as well. City states and leagues Hellenistic mosaic floor panel showing an Alexandrine parakeet, from the acropolis of Pergamon (near modern Bergama, Turkey), dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC (during the reigns of Eumenes II and Attalus II of Pergamon) In spite of their decreased political power and autonomy, the Greek city state or polis continued to be the basic form of political and social organization in Greece. Classical city states such as Athens and Ephesus grew and even thrived in this period. While warfare between Greek cities continued, the cities responded to the threat of the post Alexandrian Hellenistic states by banding together into alliances or becoming allies of a strong Hellenistic state which could come to its defense therefore making it asylos or inviolate to attack by other cities. The Aetolians and the Achaeans developed strong federal states or leagues (koinon), which were governed by councils of city representatives and assemblies of league citizens. Initially ethnic leagues, these leagues later began to include cities outside of their traditional regions.Sarah B. Pomeroy, Stanley M. Burstein, Walter Donlan, Jennifer Tolbert Roberts, and David Tandy, Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History, 2011, p. 476. The Achaean League eventually included all of the Peloponnese except Sparta, while the Aetolian League expanded into Phocis. During the third century BCE these leagues were able to defend themselves against Macedon and the Aetolian league defeated a Celtic invasion of Greece at Delphi. After Alexander's death, Athens had been defeated by Antipater in the Lamian War and its port in the Piraeus housed a Macedonian garrison. To counter the power of Macedon under Cassander, Athens courted alliances with other Hellenistic rulers such as Antigonus I Monophthalmus, and in 307 Antigonus sent his son Demetrius to capture the city. After Demetrius captured Macedon, Athens became allied with Ptolemaic Egypt in an effort to gain its independence from Demetrius, and with Ptolemaic troops they managed to rebel and defeat Macedon in 287, though the Piraeus remained garrisoned. Athens fought more unsuccessful wars against Macedon with Ptolemaic aid such as the Chremonidean War. The Ptolemaic kingdom was now the city's main ally, supporting it with troops, monies and material in multiple conflicts. Athens rewarded the Ptolemaic Kingdom in 224/223 BC by naming the 13th phyle Ptolemais and establishing a religious cult called the Ptolemaia. Hellenistic Athens also saw the rise of New Comedy and the Hellenistic schools of philosophy such as Stoicism and Epicureanism. By the turn of the century, the Attalids in Pergamon became patrons and protectors of Athens as the Ptolemaic empire weakened. Athens would later also establish a cult for the Pergamene king Attalos I. Philip V Philip V, \\"the darling of Hellas\\", wearing the royal diadem. Antigonus II died in 239 BC. His death saw another revolt of the city-states of the Achaean League, whose dominant figure was Aratus of Sicyon. Antigonus's son Demetrius II died in 229 BC, leaving a child (Philip V) as king, with the general Antigonus Doson as regent. The Achaeans, while nominally subject to Ptolemy, were in effect independent, and controlled most of southern Greece. Athens remained aloof from this conflict by common consent. Sparta remained hostile to the Achaeans, and in 227 BC Sparta's king Cleomenes III invaded Achaea and seized control of the League. Aratus preferred distant Macedon to nearby Sparta, and allied himself with Doson, who in 222 BC defeated the Spartans and annexed their city - the first time Sparta had ever been occupied by a foreign power. Philip V, who came to power when Doson died in 221 BC, was the last Macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the \\"cloud rising in the west\\": the ever-increasing power of Rome. He was known as \\"the darling of Hellas\\". Under his auspices the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought conflict between Macedon and the Greek leagues to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum. In 215 BC, however, Philip formed an alliance with Rome's enemy Carthage, which drew Rome directly into Greek affairs for the first time. Rome promptly lured the Achaean cities away from their nominal loyalty to Philip, and formed alliances with Rhodes and Pergamum, now the strongest power in Asia Minor. The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC, but Macedon was now marked as an enemy of Rome. Rome's ally Rhodes gained control of the Aegean islands. In 202 BC, Rome defeated Carthage, and was free to turn her attention eastwards, urged on by her Greek allies, Rhodes and Pergamum. In 198 BC, the Second Macedonian War broke out for obscure reasons, but very likely because Rome saw Macedon as a potential ally of the Seleucids, the greatest power in the east. Philip's allies in Greece deserted him and in 197 BC he was decisively defeated at the Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus. Luckily for the Greeks, Flamininus was a moderate man and an admirer of Greek culture. Philip had to surrender his fleet and become a Roman ally, but was otherwise spared. At the Isthmian Games in 196 BC, Flamininus declared all the Greek cities free, although Roman garrisons were placed at Corinth and Chalcis. But the freedom promised by Rome was an illusion. All the cities except Rhodes were enrolled in a new League which Rome ultimately controlled, and democracies were replaced by aristocratic regimes allied to Rome. Rise of Rome A tetradrachm of Antiochus III the Great (r. 222-187 BC), struck after 197 BC in Mesopotamia, a region of the Seleucid Empire In 192 BC, war broke out between Rome and the Seleucid ruler Antiochus III. Antiochus invaded Greece with a 10,000 man army, and was elected the commander in chief of the Aetolians. Some Greek cities now thought of Antiochus as their saviour from Roman rule, but Macedon threw its lot in with Rome. In 191 BC, the Romans under Manius Acilius Glabrio routed him at Thermopylae and obliged him to withdraw to Asia. During the course of this war Roman troops moved into Asia for the first time, where they defeated Antiochus again at Magnesia on the Sipylum (190 BC). Greece now lay across Rome's line of communications with the east, and Roman soldiers became a permanent presence. The Peace of Apamaea (188 BC) left Rome in a dominant position throughout Greece. During the following years Rome was drawn deeper into Greek politics, since the defeated party in any dispute appealed to Rome for help. Macedon was still independent, though nominally a Roman ally. When Philip V died in 179 BC, he was succeeded by his son Perseus, who like all the Macedonian kings dreamed of uniting the Greeks under Macedonian rule. Macedon was now too weak to achieve this objective, but Rome's ally Eumenes II of Pergamum persuaded Rome that Perseus was a potential threat to Rome's position. End of Greek independence Hellenistic Greek mosaic depicting the god Dionysos as a winged daimon riding on a tiger, from the House of Dionysos at Delos in the South Aegean region of Greece, late 2nd century BC, Archaeological Museum of Delos As a result of Eumenes's intrigues Rome declared war on Macedon in 171 BC, bringing 100,000 troops into Greece. Macedon was no match for this army, and Perseus was unable to rally the other Greek states to his aid. Poor generalship by the Romans enabled him to hold out for three years, but in 168 BC the Romans sent Lucius Aemilius Paullus to Greece, and at Pydna the Macedonians were crushingly defeated. Perseus was captured and taken to Rome, the Macedonian kingdom was broken up into four smaller states, and all the Greek cities who aided her, even rhetorically, were punished. Even Rome's allies Rhodes and Pergamum effectively lost their independence. Under the leadership of an adventurer called Andriscus, Macedon rebelled against Roman rule in 149 BC: as a result it was directly annexed the following year and became a Roman province, the first of the Greek states to suffer this fate. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and, feeling that they might as well die fighting, declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground. In 146 BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome's local allies. In 133 BC, the last king of Pergamum died and left his kingdom to Rome: this brought most of the Aegean peninsula under direct Roman rule as part of the province of Asia. Macedo- Ptolemaic soldiers of the Ptolemaic kingdom, 100 BC, detail of the Nile mosaic of Palestrina. The final downfall of Greece came in 88 BC, when King Mithridates of Pontus rebelled against Rome, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Although Mithridates was not Greek, many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Roman vengeance fell upon Greece again, and the Greek cities never recovered. Mithridates was finally defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 65 BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27 BC, Augustus directly annexed Greece to the new Roman Empire as the province of Achaea. The struggles with Rome had left certain areas of Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and Patras soon recovered their prosperity.

Background: Roman Greece Arch of Galerius and Rotunda, Thessaloniki. The Greek peninsula became a Roman protectorate in 146 BC, and the Aegean islands were added to this territory in 133 BC. Athens and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC, and the peninsula was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until Augustus organized the peninsula as the province of Achaea in 27 BC. Greece was a typical eastern province of the Roman Empire. The Romans sent colonists there and contributed new buildings to its cities, especially in the Agora of Athens, where the Agrippeia of Marcus Agrippa, the Library of Titus Flavius Pantaenus, and the Tower of the Winds, among others, were built. Romans tended to be philohellenic and Greeks were generally loyal to Rome. Life in Greece continued under the Roman Empire much the same as it had previously, and Greek continued to be the lingua franca in the Eastern and most important part of the Empire. Roman culture was heavily influenced by classical Greek culture (see Greco-Roman) as Horace said, Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit (Translation: \\"Captive Greece took captive her rude conqueror\\"). The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the Younger wrote using Greek styles, while famous Romans such as Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius compiled works in the Greek language. During that period, Greek intellectuals such as Galen or Apollodorus of Damascus were continuously being brought to Rome. Within the city of Rome, Greek was spoken by Roman elites, particularly philosophers, and by lower, working classes such as sailors and merchants. The emperor Nero visited Greece in 66, and performed at the Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was, of course, honored with a victory in every contest, and in 67 he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the Isthmian Games in Corinth, just as Flamininus had over 200 years previously. Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he served as eponymous archon of Athens. He also built his namesake arch there, and had a Greek lover, Antinous. At the same time Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of Christianity. The apostle Paul had preached in Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire. Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire (395 AD) Remains of the Palace of Galerius in Thessaloniki (Navarinou Square), near the Hippodromus where the Massacre of Thessalonica took place during the reign of Theodosius I. Alaric I in Athens by Ludwig Thiersch. During the second and third centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including Achaea, Macedonia, Epirus vetus and Thracia. During the reign of Diocletian in the late 3rd century, the western Balkans were organized as a Roman diocese, and was ruled by Galerius. Under Constantine I Greece was part of the dioceses of Macedonia and Thrace. The eastern and southern Aegean islands formed the province of Insulae in the Diocese of Asia. Greece faced invasions from the Heruli, Goths, and Vandals during the reign of Theodosius I. Stilicho, who acted as regent for Arcadius, evacuated Thessaly when the Visigoths invaded in the late 4th century. Arcadius' Chamberlain Eutropius allowed Alaric to enter Greece, and he looted Corinth, and the Peloponnese. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made magister militum in Illyricum. Eventually, Alaric and the Goths migrated to Italy, sacked Rome in 410, and built the Visigothic Empire in Iberia and southern France, which lasted until 711 with the advent of the Arabs. Greece remained part of the relatively unified eastern half of the empire. Contrary to outdated visions of late antiquity, the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman and later the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries.Rothaus, p. 10. \\"The question of the continuity of civic institutions and the nature of the polis in the late antique and early Byzantine world have become a vexed question, for a variety of reasons. Students of this subject continue to contend with scholars of earlier periods who adhere to a much-outdated vision of late antiquity as a decadent decline into impoverished fragmentation. The cities of late-antique Greece displayed a marked degree of continuity. Scenarios of barbarian destruction, civic decay, and manorialization simply do not fit. In fact, the city as an institution appears to have prospered in Greece during this period. It was not until the end of the 6th century (and maybe not even then) that the dissolution of the city became a problem in Greece. If the early sixth-century Synecdemus of Hierocles is taken at face value, late-antique Greece was highly urbanized and contained approximately eighty cities. This extreme prosperity is borne out by recent archaeological surveys in the Aegean. For late-antique Greece, a paradigm of prosperity and transformation is more accurate and useful than a paradigm of decline and fall.\\" In fact the polis, as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the sixth century. Contemporary texts such as Hierocles' Synecdemus affirm that in late Antiquity, Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately 80 cities. This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern Mediterranean. Following the loss of Alexandria and Antioch to the Arabs, Thessaloniki became the Byzantine Empire's second largest city, called the \\"co-regent\\" (symbasileuousa), second only to Constantinople. The Greek peninsula remained one of the strongest centers of Christianity in the late Roman and early Byzantine periods. After the area's recovery from the Slavic invasions, its wealth was restored. Events such as the Seljuk invasion of Asia Minor and the Latin occupation of Constantinople gradually focused Byzantine imperial interest to the Greek peninsula during the late Byzantine period. The Peloponnese in particular continued to prosper economically and intellectually even during its Latin domination, the Byzantine recovery, and until its final fall to the Ottoman Empire. Further invasions and reorganization (5th-8th centuries) Byzantine era monasteries in Meteora The Byzantine fortress of Kavala Greece was raided in Macedonia in 479 and 482 by the Ostrogoths under their king, Theodoric the Great (493‚Äì526).John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: The Early Centuries (Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 1996) The Bulgars also raided Thrace and the rest of northern Greece in 540 and on repeated other occasions. These continuing Bulgar invasions required the Byzantine Empire to build a defensive wall, called the \\"Anastasian Wall,\\" that extended for some thirty (30) miles, or more, from the city of Selymbria (now Silivri) to the Black Sea.John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: The Early Centuries, p. 187. The Huns and Bulgars raided Greece in 559 until the Byzantine army returned from Italy, where Justinian I had been attempting to capture the heart of the Roman Empire.Robert S. Hoyt & Stanley Chodorow, Europe in the Middle Ages (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, Inc.: New York, 1976) p. 76. According to historical documents, the Slavs invaded and settled in parts of Greece beginning in 579 and Byzantium nearly lost control of the entire peninsula during the 580s.John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: the Early Centuries, p. 260. However, there is no archaeological evidence indicating Slavic penetration of imperial Byzantine territories before the end of the 6th century. Overall, traces of Slavic culture in Greece are very rare.\\"Slavs.\\" Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Volume 3, pp. 1916-1919. Scenes of marriage and family life in Constantinople Hagia Sophia, Thessaloniki (Holy Wisdom), 8th century The city of Thessaloniki remained unconquered even after being attacked by the Slavs around 615. The Slavs were eventually defeated, gathered by the Byzantines and placed into segregated communities known as Sclaviniae. In 610 Heraclius became Emperor. During his reign, Greek became the official language of the empire. During the early 7th century, Constans II made the first mass-expulsions of Slavs from the Greek peninsula to the Balkans and central Asia Minor. Justinian II defeated and destroyed most of the Sclaviniae, and moved as many as 100‚Äì200,000 Slavs from the Greek peninsula to Bithynia, while he enlisted some 30,000 Slavs in his army.John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: The Early Centuries, p. 329. The Slavic populations that were placed in these segregated communities were used for military campaigns against the enemies of the Byzantines. In the Peloponnese, more Slavic invaders brought disorder to the western part of the peninsula, while the eastern part remained firmly under Byzantine domination. Empress Irene organised a military campaign which liberated those territories and restored Byzantine rule to the region, but it was not until emperor Nicephorus I's resettlement of some rural areas of Peloponnese with Greek-speakers from southern Italy, that the last trace of Slavic element was eliminated.Curta, Florin. Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250. Cambridge University Press, 2006. In the mid-7th century, the empire was reorganized into \\"themes\\" by the Emperor Constans II, including the Theme of Thrace, the naval Karabisianoi corps in southern Greece and the Aegean islands. The Karabisanoi were later divided by Justinian II into the Theme of Hellas (centred on Corinth) and the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme. By this time, the Slavs were no longer a threat to the Byzantines since they had been either defeated numerous times or placed in the Sclaviniae. The Slavic communities in Bithynia were destroyed by the Byzantines after General Leontios lost to the Arabs in the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 as a result of the Slavs having defected to the Arab side.John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: The Early Years, pp. 330-331 These themes rebelled against the iconoclast emperor Leo III in 727 and attempted to set up their own emperor, although Leo defeated them. Leo then moved the headquarters of the Karabisianoi to Anatolia and created the Cibyrrhaeotic Theme of them. Up to this time Greece and the Aegean were still technically under the ecclesiastic authority of the Pope, but Leo also quarreled with the Papacy and gave these territories to the Patriarch of Constantinople. As emperor, Leo III, introduced more administrative and legal reforms than had been promulgated since the time of Justinian.Robert S. Hoyt & Stanley Chodorow, Europe in the Middle Ages Meanwhile, the Arabs began their first serious raids in the Aegean. Bithynia was eventually re-populated by Greek-speaking population from mainland Greece and Cyprus. Bulgarian and Arab threats and Byzantine victory (8th-11th) Map of Byzantine Greece ca. 900 AD, with the themes and major settlements. Nicephorus I also began to reconquer Slavic and Bulgar-held areas in the early 9th century.John Julius Norwich, Byzantium: The early Centuries, p. 342. He resettled Greek-speaking families from Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula and the Balkans, and expanded the theme of Hellas to the north to include parts of Thessaly and Macedonia, and to the south to include the regained territory of the Peloponnese. Thessalonica, previously organized as an archontate surrounded by the Slavs, became a theme of its own as well. These themes contributed another 10,000 men to the army, and allowed Nicephorus to convert most of the Slavs to Christianity. Crete was conquered by the Arabs in 824. In the late 9th century Leo VI faced also invasions from the Bulgarians under Simeon I, who pillaged Thrace in 896, and again in 919 during Zoe's regency for Constantine VII. Simeon invaded northern Greece again in 922 and penetrated deep to the south seizing Thebes, just north of Athens. Crete was reconquered in 961 from the Arabs, by Nikephoros II Phokas after the Siege of Chandax. In the late 10th century the greatest threat to Greece was from Samuel, who constantly fought over the area with Basil II. In 985 Samuel captured Thessaly and the important city of Larissa, and in 989 he pillaged Thessalonica. Basil slowly began to recapture these areas in 991, but Samuel captured the areas around Thessalonica and the Peloponnese again in 997 before being forced to withdraw to Bulgaria. In 999 Samuel captured Dyrrhachium and raided northern Greece once more. Basil recaptured these areas by 1002 and had fully subjugated completely the Bulgarians in the decade before his death (see Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria). By Basil's death in 1025 Greece was divided into themes including Crete, the Peloponnese, Hellas, Nicopolis, Larissa, Cephalonia, Thessalonica and Strymon, the Cyclades and the Aegean Sea. They were protected from raids and invasions by the new themes created out of Bulgar territory. Greece and Thrace became more prosperous in the 10th century and towns and cities began to grow again. Athens and Corinth probably grew to about 10,000 people, while Thessalonica may have had as many as 100,000 people. There was an important aristocratic class from these themes, especially the Macedonian emperors who ruled the empire from 867 to 1056. Normans and Franks Greece and the empire as a whole faced a new threat from the Normans of Sicily in the late 11th century. Robert Guiscard took Dyrrhachium and Corcyra in 1081 (see Battle of Dyrrhachium), but Alexius I defeated him, and later his son Bohemund, by 1083. The Pechenegs also raided Thrace during this period. In 1147 while the knights of the Second Crusade made their way through Byzantine territory, Roger II of Sicily captured Corcyra and pillaged Thebes and Corinth. In 1197 Henry VI of Germany continued his father Frederick Barbarossa's antagonism towards the empire by threatening to invade Greece to reclaim the territory the Normans had briefly held. Alexius III was forced to pay him off, although the taxes he imposed caused frequent revolts against him, including rebellions in Greece and the Peloponnese. Also during his reign, the Fourth Crusade attempted to place Alexius IV on the throne, until it eventually invaded and sacked the capital. Greece was relatively peaceful and prosperous in the 11th and 12th centuries, compared to Anatolia which was being overrun by the Seljuks. Thessalonica had probably grown to about 150,000 people, despite being looted by the Normans in 1185. Thebes also became a major city with perhaps 30,000 people, and was the centre of a major silk industry. Athens and Corinth probably still had around 10,000 people. Mainland Greek cities continued to export grain to the capital in order to make up for the land lost to the Seljuks. However, after Constantinople was conquered during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Greece was divided among the Crusaders. The Latin Empire held Constantinople and Thrace, while Greece itself was divided into the Kingdom of Thessalonica, the Principality of Achaea, and the Duchy of Athens. The Venetians controlled the Duchy of the Archipelago in the Aegean, while the Despotate of Epirus was established as one of the three Byzantine Greek successor states. Michael VIII restored the empire in 1261, having also regained the Kingdom of Thessalonica. By his death in 1282, Michael had taken back the Aegean islands, Thessaly, Epirus, and most of Achaea, including the Crusader fortress of Mystras, which became the seat of a Byzantine despotate. However, Athens and the northern Peloponnese remained in Crusader hands. Charles of Anjou and later his son claimed the throne of the defunct Latin Empire, and threatened Epirus and Greece, but were never able to make any progress there. Ottoman threat and conquest Palace of Mystras, capital of the Despotate of the Morea. By the reign of Andronicus III Palaeologus, beginning in 1328, the empire controlled most of Greece, especially the metropolis of Thessalonica, but very little else. Epirus was nominally Byzantine but still occasionally rebelled, until it was fully recovered in 1339. Greece was mostly used as a battleground during the civil war between John V Palaeologus and John VI Cantacuzenus in the 1340s, and at the same time the Serbs and Ottomans began attacking Greece as well. By 1356 another independent despotate was set up in Epirus and Thessaly. The Peloponnese, usually called Morea in this period, was now almost the centre of the empire, and was certainly the most fertile area. Mystras and Monemvasia were populous and prosperous, even after the Black Plague in the mid-14th century. Mystras rivaled Constantinople in importance. It was a stronghold of Greek Orthodoxy and bitterly opposed attempts by the emperors to unite with the Catholic Church, even though this would have allowed the empire to gain help from the west against the Ottomans. The Ottomans had begun their conquest of the Balkans and Greece in the late 14th century and early 15th century capturing among others Thessaloniki, Ioannina and Thessaly. In 1445, Ottoman-occupied Thessaly was recaptured by the future emperor Constantine XI, at the time despot of Mystras, but there was little he could do against most of the other Ottoman territories. Emperor Constantine XI was defeated and killed in 1453 when the Ottomans finally captured Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople, the Ottomans also captured Athens by 1458, but left a Byzantine despotate in the Peloponnese until 1460. The Venetians still controlled Crete, Aegean islands and some cities-ports, but otherwise the Ottomans controlled many regions of Greece except the mountains and heavily forested areas.

","title":"Byzantine Greece"},{"id":"565613","text":"Most of the areas which today are within modern Greece's borders were at some point in the past a part of the Ottoman Empire. This period of Ottoman rule in Greece, lasting from the mid-15th century until the successful Greek War of Independence that broke out in 1821 and the proclamation of the First Hellenic Republic in 1822 (preceded by the creation of the autonomous Septinsular Republic in 1800), is known in Greek as Tourkokratia (, \\"Turkish rule\\"; ).Bruce Merry, Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature, oTurkocracy, p. 442. Some regions, however, like the Ionian islands, various temporary Venetian possessions of the Stato da Mar, or Mani peninsula in Peloponnese did not become part of the Ottoman administration, although the latter was under Ottoman suzerainty. The Eastern Roman Empire, the remnant of the ancient Roman Empire which ruled most of the Greek-speaking world for over 1100 years, had been fatally weakened since the sacking of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders in 1204. The Ottoman advance into Greece was preceded by victory over the Serbs to its north. First, the Ottomans won the Battle of Maritsa in 1371. The Serb forces were then led by the King Vuka≈°in of Serbia, the father of Prince Marko and the co-ruler of the last emperor from the Serbian Nemanjic dynasty. This was followed by another Ottoman draw in the 1389 Battle of Kosovo. With no further threat by the Serbs and the subsequent Byzantine civil wars, the Ottomans besieged and took Constantinople in 1453 and then advanced southwards into Greece, capturing Athens in 1458. The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, and the Venetians and Genoese clung to some of the islands, but by the early 16th century all of mainland Greece and most of the Aegean islands were in Ottoman hands, excluding several port cities still held by the Venetians (Nafplio, Monemvasia, Parga and Methone the most important of them). The mountains of Greece were largely untouched, and were a refuge for Greeks who desired to flee Ottoman rule and engage in guerrilla warfare. The Cyclades islands, in the middle of the Aegean, were officially annexed by the Ottomans in 1579, although they were under vassal status since the 1530s. Cyprus fell in 1571, and the Venetians retained Crete until 1669. The Ionian Islands were never ruled by the Ottomans, with the exception of Kefalonia (from 1479 to 1481 and from 1485 to 1500), and remained under the rule of the Republic of Venice. It was in the Ionian Islands where modern Greek statehood was born, with the creation of the Republic of the Seven Islands in 1800. Ottoman Greece was a multiethnic society. However, the modern Western notion of multiculturalism, although at first glance appears to correspond to the system of millets, is considered to be incompatible with the Ottoman system.Maurus Reinkowski, ‚ÄúOttoman ‚ÄúMulticulturalism‚Äù? The Example of the Confessional System in Lebanon‚Äù. Lecture , Istanbul, 1997. Edited by the Orient-Institut der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, Beirut,1999, pp. 15, 16. The Greeks with the one hand were given some privileges and freedom; with the other they were exposed to a tyranny deriving from the malpractices of its administrative personnel over which the central government had only remote and incomplete control.Douglas Dakin, The Greek Struggle for Independence, 1821-1833. University of California Press, p. 16. Despite losing their political independence, the Greeks remained dominant in the fields of commerce and business. The consolidation of Ottoman power in the 15th and 16th centuries rendered the Mediterranean safe for Greek shipping, and Greek shipowners became the maritime carriers of the Empire, making tremendous profits.http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i9187.pdf After the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Lepanto however, Greek ships often became the target of vicious attacks by Catholic (especially Spanish and Maltese) pirates. This period of Ottoman rule had a profound impact in Greek society, as new elites emerged. The Greek land-owning aristocracy that traditionally dominated the Byzantine Empire suffered a tragic fate, and was almost completely destroyed. The new leading class in Ottoman Greece were the prokritoiClogg, 2002 (œÄœÅœåŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒøŒπ in Greek) called kocaba≈üis by the Ottomans. The prokritoi were essentially bureaucrats and tax collectors, and gained a negative reputation for corruption and nepotism. On the other hand, the Phanariots became prominent in the imperial capital of Constantinople as businessmen and diplomats, and the Greek Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarch rose to great power under the Sultan's protection, gaining religious control over the entire Orthodox population of the Empire, Greek, Œëlbanian-speaking, Latin- speaking and Slavic. Ottoman expansion After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Despotate of the Morea was the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, it fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the conquest of mainland Greece. While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century, Cyprus and Crete remained Venetian territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped Ottoman rule was the Ionian Islands, which remained Venetian until 1797. Corfu withstood three major sieges in 1537, 1571 and 1716 all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans. Other areas that remained part of the Venetian Stato da M√†r include Nafplio and Monemvasia until 1540, the Duchy of the Archipelago, centered on the islands of Naxos and Paros until 1579, Sifnos until 1617 and Tinos until 1715.

The consolidation of Ottoman rule was followed by two distinct trends of Greek migration. The first entailed Greek intellectuals, such as Basilios Bessarion, Georgius Plethon Gemistos and Marcos Mousouros, migrating to other parts of Western Europe and influencing the advent of the Renaissance (though the large scale migration of Greeks to other parts of Europe, most notably Italian university cities, began far earlier, following the Crusader capture of ConstantinopleTreadgold, Warren. History of Byzantine State and Society. Stanford University Press, 1997. ). This trend had also effect on the creation of the modern Greek diaspora. The second entailed Greeks leaving the plains of the Greek peninsula and resettling in the mountains, where the rugged landscape made it hard for the Ottomans to establish either military or administrative presence.Vacalopoulos, p. 45. \\"The Greeks never lost their desire to escape from the heavy hand of the Turks, bad government, the impressment of their children, the increasingly heavy taxation, and the sundry caprices of the conqueror. Indeed, anyone studying the last two centuries of Byzantine rule cannot help being struck by the propensity of the Greeks to flee misfortune. The routes they chiefly took were: first, to the predominantly Greek territories, which were either still free or Frankish- controlled (that is to say, the Venetian fortresses in the Despotate of Morea, as well as in the Aegean and Ionian Islands) or else to Italy and the West generally; second, to remote mountain districts in the interior where the conqueror's yoke was not yet felt.\\" Administration Map of \\"Rumelia\\" in 1801. Almost all the Balkan peninsula was called \\"land of the Romans\\" by the Ottomans The Sultan sat at the apex of the government of the Ottoman Empire. Although he had the trappings of an absolute ruler, he was actually bound by tradition and convention. These restrictions imposed by tradition were mainly of a religious nature. Indeed, the Qur'an was the main restriction on absolute rule by the sultan and in this way, the Qur'an served as a \\"constitution.\\" Ottoman rule of the provinces was characterized by two main functions. The local administrators within the provinces were to maintain a military establishment and to collect taxes.C. M. Woodhouse, Modern Greece: A Short History, p. 101. The military establishment was feudal in character. The Sultan's cavalry were allotted land, either large allotments or small allotments based on the rank of the individual cavalryman. All non-Muslims were forbidden to ride a horse which made traveling more difficult. The Ottomans divided Greece into six sanjaks, each ruled by a Sanjakbey accountable to the Sultan, who established his capital in Constantinople in 1453. \\"The Hyperian Fountain at Pherae\\", Edward Dodwell, 1821. View of the Phanarion quarter, the historical centre of the Greek community of Constantinople in Ottoman times, ca. 1900 The conquered land was parceled out to Ottoman soldiers, who held it as feudal fiefs (timars and ziamets) directly under the Sultan's authority. This land could not be sold or inherited, but reverted to the Sultan's possession when the fief-holder (timariot) died. During their life-times they served as cavalrymen in the Sultan's army, living well on the proceeds of their estates with the land being tilled largely by peasants. Many Ottoman timariots were descended from the pre-Ottoman Christian nobility, and shifted their allegiance to the Ottomans following the conquest of the Balkans. Conversion to Islam was not a requirement, and as late as the fifteenth century many timariots were known to be Christian, although their numbers gradually decreased over time. The Ottomans basically installed this feudal system right over the top of the existing system of peasant tenure. The peasantry remained in possession of their own land and their tenure over their plot of land remained hereditary and inalienable. Nor was any military service ever imposed on the peasant by the Ottoman government. All non-Muslims were in theory forbidden from carrying arms, but this was ignored. Indeed, in regions such as Crete, almost every man carried arms. Greek Christian families were, however, subject to a system of brutal forced conscription known as the devshirme. The Ottomans required that male children from Christian peasant villages be conscripted and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries for military training in the Sultan's army. Such recruitment was sporadic, and the proportion of children conscripted varied from region to region. The practice largely came to an end by the middle of the seventeenth century. Under the Ottoman system of government, Greek society was at the same time fostered and restricted. With one hand the Turkish regime gave privileges and freedom to its subject people; with the other it imposed a tyranny deriving from the malpractices of its administrative personnel over which it exercised only remote and incomplete control. In fact the ‚Äúrayahs‚Äù were downtrodden and exposed to the vagaries of Turkish administration and sometimes to the Greek landlords. The term rayah came to denote an underprivileged, tax-ridden and socially inferior population.Douglas Dakin, 1973, p. 16. Economy The Greek ship Panagia tis Hydras, built 1793, flying the Greco-Ottoman flag. Western harbour of the island of Samos, painted by Luigi Mayer Painting of the bazaar at Athens, Ottoman Greece, early 19th century The economic situation of the majority of Greece deteriorated heavily during the Ottoman era of the country. Life became ruralized and militarized. Heavy burdens of taxation were placed on the Christian population, and many Greeks were reduced to subsistence farming whereas during prior eras the region had been heavily developed and urbanized. The exception to this rule was in Constantinople and the Venetian-held Ionian islands, where many Greeks lived in prosperity.Micha≈Ç Bzinkowski , Eleuther√≠a ƒì Th√°natos!: The idea of freedom in modern Greek poetry during the war of independence in 19th century. Dionysios Solomos‚Äô ‚ÄúHymn to Liberty‚Äù After about 1600, the Ottomans resorted to military rule in parts of Greece, which provoked further resistance, and also led to economic dislocation and accelerated population decline. Ottoman landholdings, previously fiefs held directly from the Sultan, became hereditary estates (chifliks), which could be sold or bequeathed to heirs. The new class of Ottoman landlords reduced the hitherto free Greek farmers to serfdom, leading to depopulation of the plains, and to the flight of many people to the mountains, in order to escape poverty. Religion The Sultan regarded the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church as the leader of all Orthodox, Greeks or not, within the empire. The Patriarch was accountable to the Sultan for the good behavior of the Orthodox population, and in exchange he was given wide powers over the Orthodox communities, including the non- Greek Slavic peoples. The Patriarch controlled the courts and the schools, as well as the Church, throughout the Greek communities of the empire. This made Orthodox priests, together with the local magnates, called Prokritoi or Dimogerontes, the effective rulers of Greek towns and cities. Some Greek towns, such as Athens and Rhodes, retained municipal self-government, while others were put under Ottoman governors. Several areas, such as the Mani Peninsula in the Peloponnese, and parts of Crete (Sfakia) and Epirus, remained virtually independent. During the frequent Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wars, the Greeks sided with the Venetians against the Ottomans, with a few exceptions.For example, during the Ottoman conquest of the Morea in 1715, local Greeks supplied the Ottomans and refused to join the Venetian army due to feared future reprisals by the Ottomans. (Stavrianos, L.S. The Balkans since 1453, p. 181). The Patriarchate of Constantinople in general remained loyal to the Ottomans against the western threats (as for example during the Dionysios Skylosophos revolt, etc). The Orthodox Church assisted greatly in the preservation of the Greek heritage, and adherence to the Greek Orthodox faith became increasingly a mark of Greek nationality. The emblem of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. As a rule, the Ottomans did not require the Greeks to become Muslims, although many did so on a superficial level in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman ruleCrypto-Christians of the Trabzon Region of Pontos or because of the alleged corruption of the Greek clergy.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 143 The regions of Greece which had the largest concentrations of Ottoman Greek Muslims were Macedonia, notably the Vallaades, neighboring Epirus, and Crete (see Cretan Muslims). Under the millet logic, Greek Muslims, despite often retaining elements of their Greek culture and language, were classified simply as \\"Muslim\\", although most Greek Orthodox Christians deemed them to have \\"turned-Turk\\" and therefore saw them as traitors to their original ethno-religious communities.The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 137-138 Some Greeks either became New Martyrs, such as Saint Efraim the Neo-Martyr or Saint Demetrios the Neo-martyr while others became Crypto-Christians (Greek Muslims who were secret practitioners of the Greek Orthodox faith) in order to avoid heavy taxes and at the same time express their identity by maintaining their secret ties to the Greek Orthodox Church. Crypto-Christians officially ran the risk of being killed if they were caught practicing a non-Muslim religion once they converted to Islam. There were also instances of Greeks from theocratic or Byzantine nobility embracing Islam such as John Tzelepes Komnenos and Misac Palaeologos Pasha. Treatment of Christian subjects varied greatly under the rule of the Ottoman Sultans. Bayezid I, according to a Byzantine historian, freely admitted Christians into his society while trying to grow his empire, in the early Ottoman period. Later, although the Turkish ruler attempted to pacify the local population with a restoration of peacetime rule of law, the Christian population also became subject to special taxes and the tribute of Christian children to the Ottoman state to feed the ranks of the Janissary corps. tThe preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 128 Violent persecutions of Christians did nevertheless take place under the reign of Selim I (1512-1520), known as Selim the Grim, who attempted to stamp out Christianity from the Ottoman Empire. Selim ordered the confiscation of all Christian churches, and while this order was later rescinded, Christians were heavily persecuted during his era.Paroulakis, p. 11. Taxation and the \\"tribute of children\\" A Muslim Greek Mamluk (Louis Dupr√©, oil on canvas, 1825) Greeks paid a land tax and a heavy tax on trade, the latter taking advantage of the wealthy Greeks to fill the state coffers.Douglas Dakin,the Greek struggle for independence, 1972 Greeks, like other Christians, were also made to pay the jizya, or Islamic poll-tax which all non-Muslims in the empire were forced to pay instead of the Zakat that Muslims must pay as part of the 5 pillars of Islam. Failure to pay the jizya could result in the pledge of protection of the Christian's life and property becoming void, facing the alternatives of conversion, enslavement, or death.James E. Lindsay Daily life in the medieval Islamic world, (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005) p.121 Like in the rest of the Ottoman Empire, Greeks had to carry a receipt certifying their payment of jizya at all times or be subject to imprisonment. Most Greeks did not have to serve in the Sultan's army, but the young boys that were taken away and converted to Islam were made to serve in the Ottoman military. In addition, girls were taken in order to serve as odalisques in harems.Madeline C. Zilfi Women and slavery in the late Ottoman Empire Cambridge University Press, 2010 These practices are called the \\"tribute of children\\" (devshirmeh) (in Greek œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒøŒºŒ¨Œ∂œâŒºŒ± paidomazoma, meaning \\"child gathering\\"), whereby every Christian community was required to give one son in five to be raised as a Muslim and enrolled in the corps of Janissaries, elite units of the Ottoman army. There was much resistance to this. For example, Greek folklore tells of mothers crippling their sons to avoid their abduction. Nevertheless, entrance into the corps (accompanied by conversion to Islam) offered Greek boys the opportunity to advance as high as governor or even Grand Vizier. Opposition of the Greek populace to taxing or paidomazoma resulted in grave consequences. For example, in 1705 an Ottoman official was sent from Naoussa in Macedonia to search and conscript new Janissaries and was killed by Greek rebels who resisted the burden of the devshirmeh. The rebels were subsequently beheaded and their severed heads were displayed in the city of Thessaloniki.Vasdravellis, I. ŒüŒπ ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥œåŒΩŒµœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ 1821 (The Macedonians during the Revolution of 1821), 3rd improved edition, Thessaloniki: Society of Macedonian Studies, 1967. In some cases, it was greatly feared as Greek families would often have to relinquish their own sons who would convert and return later as their oppressors. In other cases, the families bribed the officers to ensure that their children got a better life as a government officer.Shaw, p. 114. Influence to tradition After the 16th century, many Greek folk songs (dimotika) were produced and inspired from the way of life of the Greek people, brigands and the armed conflicts during the centuries of Ottoman rule. Klephtic songs (Greek: ŒöŒªŒ≠œÜœÑŒπŒ∫Œ± œÑœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒøœçŒ¥ŒπŒ±), or ballads, are a subgenre of the Greek folk music genre and are thematically oriented on the life of the klephts. Prominent conflicts were immortalised in several folk tales and songs, such as the epic ballad To tragoudi tou Daskalogianni of 1786, about the resistance warfare under Daskalogiannis.Roderick Beaton Folk Poetry of Modern Greece 248 pages Publisher: Cambridge University Press (May 20, 2004) Emergence of Greek nationalism Leonardos Philaras (c. 1595 - 1673) was a Greek scholar born in Athens, and an early supporter of Greek liberation from Ottoman rule, spending much of his career in persuading Western European intellectuals to support Greek Independence. Rigas Feraios, intellectual and forerunner of the Greek War of Independence Over the course of the eighteenth century Ottoman landholdings, previously fiefs held directly from the Sultan, became hereditary estates (chifliks), which could be sold or bequeathed to heirs. The new class of Ottoman landlords reduced the hitherto free Greek peasants to serfdom, leading to further poverty and depopulation in the plains. On the other hand, the position of educated and privileged Greeks within the Ottoman Empire improved greatly in the 17th and 18th centuries.Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789-1848, Part 1, Chapter 7, II, pp. 140‚Äì142. From the late 1600s Greeks began to fill some of the highest and most important offices of the Ottoman state. The Phanariotes, a class of wealthy Greeks who lived in the Phanar district of Constantinople, became increasingly powerful. Their travels to Western Europe as merchants or diplomats brought them into contact with advanced ideas of liberalism and nationalism, and it was among the Phanariotes that the modern Greek nationalist movement was born. Many Greek merchants and travelers were influenced by the ideas of the French revolution and a new Age of Greek Enlightenment was initiated at the beginning of the 19th century in many Ottoman-ruled Greek cities and towns. Greek nationalism was also stimulated by agents of Catherine the Great, the Orthodox ruler of the Russian Empire, who hoped to acquire Ottoman territory, including Constantinople itself, by inciting a Christian rebellion against the Ottomans. However, during the Russian-Ottoman War which broke out in 1768, the Greeks did not rebel, disillusioning their Russian patrons. The Treaty of Kuchuk- Kainarji (1774) gave Russia the right to make \\"representations\\" to the Sultan in defense of his Orthodox subjects, and the Russians began to interfere regularly in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire. This, combined with the new ideas let loose by the French Revolution of 1789, began to reconnect the Greeks with the outside world and led to the development of an active nationalist movement, one of the most progressive of the time. Greece was peripherally involved in the Napoleonic Wars, but one episode had important consequences. When the French under Napoleon Bonaparte seized Venice in 1797, they also acquired the Ionian Islands, thus ending the four hundredth year of Venetian rule over the Ionian Islands. The islands were elevated to the status of a French dependency called the Septinsular Republic, which possessed local autonomy. This was the first time Greeks had governed themselves since the fall of Trebizond in 1461. Among those who held office in the islands was John Capodistria, destined to become independent Greece's first head of state. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, Greece had re-emerged from its centuries of isolation. British and French writers and artists began to visit the country, and wealthy Europeans began to collect Greek antiquities. These \\"philhellenes\\" were to play an important role in mobilizing support for Greek independence. Uprisings before 1821 Battle of Chios (Chesma), during the Orlov Revolt, by Ivan Aivazovsky (1848) Greeks in various places of the Greek peninsula would at times rise up against Ottoman rule, mainly while taking advantage of wars the Ottoman Empire would engage in. Those uprisings were of mixed scale and impact. During the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì1479), the Maniot Kladas brothers, Krokodelos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti on behalf of Venice against the Turks in Southern Peloponnese. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor.Longnon, J. 1949. Chronique de Mor√©e: Livre de la conqueste de la princ√©e de l‚ÄôAmor√©e, 1204-1305. Paris. Before and after the victory of the Holy League in 1571 at the Battle of Lepanto a series of conflicts broke out in the peninsula such as in Epirus, Phocis (recorded in the Chronicle of Galaxeidi) and the Peloponnese, led by the Melissinos brothers and others. They crushed by the following year.ŒëœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÖ ŒíŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÖ, ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒùŒ≠ŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπœÉŒºŒøœç, Œì‚Äô œÑŒøŒº., ŒòŒµœÉœÉŒ±ŒªŒøŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ 1968 Short-term revolts of local level occurred throughout the region such as the ones led by metropolitan bishop Dionysius the Philosopher in Thessaly (1600) and Epirus (1611).Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall: Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches: Bd. 1574-1623, p. 442; note a. \\"Prete scorticato, la pelle sua piena di paglia portata in Constantinopoli con molte teste dei figli d'Albanesi, che avevano intelligenza colli Spagnoli\\" During the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669), the Maniots would aid Francesco Morosini and the Venetians in the Peloponnese.Setton, Kenneth Meyer (1991), Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century, DIANE Publishing p189 Greek irregulars also aided the Venetians through the Morean War in their operations on the Ionian Sea and Peloponnese.Finlay, George (1856). The History of Greece under Othoman and Venetian Domination. London: William Blackwood and Sons. p 210-3 A major uprising during that period was the Orlov Revolt (Greek: ŒüœÅŒªœâœÜŒπŒ∫Œ¨) which took place during the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) and triggered armed unrest in both the Greek mainland and the islands.George Childs Kohn (Editor) Dictionary of Wars 650 pages Page 155 In 1778, a Greek fleet of seventy vessels assembled by Lambros Katsonis which harassed the Turkish squadrons in the Aegean sea, captured the island of Kastelorizo and engaged the Turkish fleet in naval battles until 1790.Finley, The history of Greece under Othman and Venetian Domination, 1856 pp. 330-334Dakin, Douglas The Greek Struggle for Independence, 1821‚Äì1833, University of California Press, (1973) pp. 26‚Äì27 Greek War of Independence Kanaris\\" by Nikiphoros Lytras. The Massacre at Chios (1824) by Eug√®ne Delacroix. A secret Greek nationalist organization called the \\"Friendly Society\\" or \\"Company of Friends\\" (Filiki Eteria) was formed in Odessa in 1814. The members of the organization planned a rebellion with the support of wealthy Greek exile communities in Britain and the United States. They also gained support from sympathizers in Western Europe, as well as covert assistance from Russia. The organization secured Capodistria, who became Russian Foreign Minister after leaving the Ionian Islands, as the leader of the planned revolt. On March 25 (now Greek Independence Day) 1821, the Orthodox Bishop Germanos of Patras proclaimed a national uprising. The Ottomans, in retaliation orchestrated the Constantinople massacre of 1821 and similar pogroms in Smyrna.Prousis, Theophilus C., \\"Smyrna in 1821: A Russian View\\" (1992). History Faculty Publications. 16, pp. 145, 146 Simultaneous risings were planned across Greece, including in Macedonia, Crete, and Cyprus. With the initial advantage of surprise, aided by Ottoman inefficiency and the Ottomans' fight against Ali Pasha of Tepelen, the Greeks succeeded in capturing the Peloponnese and some other areas. Some of the first Greek actions were taken against unarmed Ottoman settlements, with about 40% of Turkish and Albanian Muslim residents of the Peloponnese killed outright, and the rest fleeing the area or being deported.Jelavich, p. 217. The Ottomans recovered, and retaliated in turn with savagery, massacring the Greek population of Chios and other towns. This worked to their disadvantage by provoking further sympathy for the Greeks in Britain and France. The Greeks were unable to establish a strong government in the areas they controlled, and fell to fighting amongst themselves. Inconclusive fighting between Greeks and Ottomans continued until 1825 when the Sultan sent a powerful fleet and army who were mainly Bedouin and some Sudanese from Egypt under Ibrahim Pasha to suppress the revolution, promising to him the rule of Peloponnese, however they were eventually defeated in the Battle of Navarino in 1827. The atrocities that accompanied this expedition, together with sympathy aroused by the death of the poet and leading philhellene Lord Byron at Messolongi in 1824, eventually led the Great Powers to intervene. In October 1827, the British, French and Russian fleets, on the initiative of local commanders, but with the tacit approval of their governments, destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. This was the decisive moment in the war of independence. In October 1828, the French landed troops in the Peloponnese to evacuate it from Ibrahim's army, while Russia was since April at war against the Ottomans. Under their protection, the Greeks were able to reorganize, form a new government and defeat the Ottomans in the Battle of Petra, the final battle of the war. They then advanced to seize as much territory as possible before the Western powers imposed a ceasefire. A conference in London in 1830 proposed a fully independent Greek state (and not autonomous as previously proposed). The final borders were defined during the London Conference of 1832 with northern frontier running from Arta to Volos, and including only Euboia and the Cyclades among the islands. The Greeks were disappointed at these restricted frontiers, but were in no position to resist the will of Britain, France and Russia, who had contributed mightily to Greek independence. By the Convention of May 11, 1832, Greece was finally recognized as a sovereign state. Capodistria, who had been Greece's governor since 1828, had been assassinated by the Mavromichalis family in October 1831. To prevent further experiments with republican government, the Great Powers, especially Russia, insisted that Greece should be a monarchy, and the Bavarian Prince Otto, was chosen to be its first King.

Biography Born in Buffalo, New York as Robert Emil Schmidt, he attended Masten Park High School. Schmidt got his start in radio in Buffalo. He started at WGR (AM) but switched from WGR to WBEN's late morning radio slot in 1943, as part of a move which also brought Clint Buehlman's early morning show over from WGR to WBEN at the same time. (The WBEN morning slot had opened when its host, future NBC-TV personality Jack Paar, was drafted into the military.)David Marc, \\"Smith, Buffalo Bob\\" American National Biography (2008) WBEN was seeking to break WGR's #1 position in local popularity and shaking the position of network-fed Don McNeil's Breakfast Club's grip on ratings for the 9 am time slot was an important part of the plan. WBEN first brought Clint Buehlman's popular early morning show, which ended at 9am, followed by 15 minutes of local news, over from WGR. Then, Buffalo Bob appeared at 9:15 am. Within a period of time, Smith had won the #1 spot in late mornings for WBEN and McNeil dropped to second in the Buffalo market. Smith's popularity in Buffalo won the attention of NBC, which brought him to New York after the war to host early mornings on flagship station WNBC, a post he held through the early 1950s before concentrating on television. For a time between 1947 and 1953 he appeared mornings on WNBC while hosting and producing the daily Howdy Doody show.Marc, \\"Smith, Buffalo Bob\\" American National Biography (2008) The Howdy Doody show The puppet Howdy Doody was based on a caricature of Mr. Smith's sister, Esther. She was employed at a department store and Howdy was the spitting image of her. Smith also was known as a singer and musician, appearing on many top shows of the time before and even after becoming nationally known for the Howdy Doody show. At first it aired on Saturdays, then on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and finally, five times a week. In 1954, Smith suffered a heart attack and for a time, he did the show from a studio built in the basement of his home in Mount Vernon, New York. He returned to the NBC studio in 1955. The final NBC Howdy Doody episode aired in 1960. Later, in 1976, Smith reunited with longtime show producer Roger Muir and several of the original cast to produce a new daily syndicated Howdy Doody show. David Marc describes a show: : Smith who built it into an enduring hit and one of television's first profitable franchises for licensed product tie‚Äêins....Whereas other 1950s children's series were appreciated by adults for their tender wit‚Äîsuch as Burr Tillstrom's puppet show \\"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\\"‚Äîor were presented for educational value‚Äîsuch as \\"Ask Mr. Wizard\\", a science show‚Äîthe Howdy Doody Show was strictly aimed at pleasing children, which it did to dizzying excess. With an audience of screaming kids filling the ‚ÄúPeanut Gallery‚Äù onstage to energize the millions watching at home, Buffalo Bob in cowboy buckskins opened each show by shouting out the signature question, ‚ÄúHey kids, what time is it?‚Äù The verbal response by the audience, ‚ÄúIt's Howdy Doody Time!‚Äù cued a rousing theme song, which inspired salty parodies in schoolyards across the country. The energy and decibel levels of the show were kept high throughout. When not taking a pratfall‚Äîsometimes on an actual banana peel‚ÄîSmith was the target of Clarabell's high‚Äêpressure seltzer bottle. The show was particularly effective in its relentless use of words and nonsense syllables designed to drive children giddy with laughter. Flub‚Äêa‚ÄêDub, for instance, was a fantasy animal character that could survive only by eating meatballs. Such songs as ‚ÄúOoga Booga Rocka Shmooga‚Äù and ‚ÄúIggly Wiggly Spaghetti‚Äù sent the Peanut Gallery into paroxysms of laughter.Marc, \\"Smith, Buffalo Bob\\" American National Biography (2008) After Howdy Doody In 1970 and 1971, Smith embarked on a live tour of college campuses. The shows, organized by producer Burt DuBrow, mixed nostalgia with more contemporary humor, such as Buffalo Bob finding a package of Zig Zags (rolling paper) allegedly belonging to Clarabell. One show, on April 4, 1971, was recorded and released as an LP, on the Project 3 Total Sound Stereo label. It was titled Buffalo Bob Smith Live at Bill Graham's Fillmore East. Smith had a summer residence in Grand Lake Stream, Maine. He was well-liked by locals and occasionally hosted local events. He owned radio stations WQDY in Calais, Maine, WMKR (now WSYY) in Millinocket, Maine and WHOU in Houlton, Maine. Later life His other screen efforts include films, Track of Thunder (1968) and Problem Child 2 (1991), as Father Flanagan. He also made guest appearances on Happy Days and What's My Line, as well as the television specials, NBC's 60th Anniversary Celebration (1986), and It's Howdy Doody Time (1987). After his retirement, Smith retired to Henderson County, North Carolina, becoming a member of the Pinecrest Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARP) in Flat Rock. Death and legacy He made a live infomercial appearance to promote Howdy Doody Entertainment Memorabilia on July 3, 1998, on QVC. That was his last appearance. Smith died of cancer a few weeks later on July 30, 1998, in a hospital in Hendersonville, North Carolina, just three days before puppeteer Shari Lewis, whose show took over the time slot that Howdy Doody had previously occupied.\\"Buffalo Bob Smith, a singing piano player and chatty radio disk jockey who created Howdy Doody and then teamed up with the puppet on one of early television's most enduring children's shows, died of cancer yesterday at a hospital near his home in Flat Rock, N.C. ...

The process is one of the simplest ways to extract gold, and is popular with geology enthusiasts especially because of its low cost and relative simplicity. The first recorded instances of placer mining are from ancient Rome, where gold and other precious metals were extracted from streams and mountainsides using sluices and panning. However, the productivity rate is comparatively smaller compared to other methods such as the rocker box or large extractors, such as those used at the Super Pit gold mine, in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, which has led to panning being largely replaced in the commercial market. Process \\"Panning out\\" ~ Stereoscopic view of print taken by the U.S. Geological and Geographic Survey of the Territories ~ circa 1874 - 1879 Gold panning is a simple process. Once a suitable placer deposit is located, some alluvial deposits are scooped into a pan, where they are then wetted and loosed from attached soils by soaking, fingering and aggressive agitation in water. This is called stratification; which helps dense materials, like gold, sink to the bottom of the pan. Materials with low specific gravity will rise upward, allowing these to be washed out of the pan, whereas materials with higher specific gravity, sinking to the bottom of the sediment during stratification, will remain in the pan allowing examination and collection by the prospector. These dense materials usually consist of black sand with whatever stones or dense metal particles that may be found in the deposit that is used for source material. While an effective method with certain kinds of deposits, and essential for prospecting, even skilled panners can only work a limited amount of material, significantly less than the other methods which have replaced it in larger operation. Pans remain in use in places where there is limited capital or infrastructure, as well as in recreational gold mining. In many situations, gold panning usually turns up only minor gold dust that is usually collected as a souvenir in small clear tubes by hobbyists. Nuggets and considerable amounts of dust are occasionally found, but panning mining is not generally lucrative. Panning for gold can be used to locate the parent gold veins which are the source of most placer deposits. Pans Various designs of gold pans from around the world Panning Gold in New Spain, Early Colonial Period, c. 1535. The pans appear to be bateas. Gold pans of various designs have been developed over the years, the common features being a means for trapping the heavy materials during agitation, or for easily removing them at the end of the process. Some are intended for use with mercury, include screens, sharp corners for breaking ice, are non-round, or are even designed for use \\"with or without water\\". Edward Otho Cresap Ord, II, a former Army officer and co-owner of several mines, patented several pan designs including designs for use with mercury or dry.Note: Call number 90A469 in four series. Series 1 deal with correspondence 1940 to 1963. SERIES: 5. E.O.C. Ord II: Patents and Printed Materials.''' Pans are measured by their diameter in inches or centimeters. Common sizes of gold pans today range between , with being the most used size. The sides are generally angled between 30¬∞ to 45¬∞. Pans are manufactured in both metal and high-impact plastic. Russia iron or heavy gauge steel pans are traditional. Steel pans are heavier and stronger than plastic pans. Some are made of lightweight alloys for structural stability. Plastic gold pans resist rust, acid and corrosion, and most are designed with moulded riffles along one side of the pan. Of the plastic gold pans, green and red ones are usually preferred among prospectors, as both the gold and the black sand stands out in the bottom of the pan, although many also opt for black pans instead to easily identify gold deposits. The batea, Spanish for \\"gold pan\\", is a particular variant of gold pan. Traditionally made of a solid piece of wood, it may also be made of metal. Bateas are used in areas where there is less water available for use than with traditional gold pans, such as Mexico and South America, where it was introduced by the Spanish. Bateas are larger than other gold pans, being closer to half a meter (20 inches) in diameter. Yuri-ita The yuri-ita (Êè∫„ÇäÊùø), Japanese for \\"rocking plate\\" is a traditional wooden gold pan used in Japan. Unlike other gold pans, it is rectangular in shape with a concave cross section and is sealed off at one end with the other end open. As the Japanese name implies, the gold is panned with a rocking motion.

One reason that notes with many beams are rare is that, for instance, a thirty-second note at = 50 lasts the same amount of time as a sixteenth note at = 100; every note in a piece may be notated as twice as long but last the same amount of time if the tempo is also doubled. They are principally used for brief, rapid sections in slow movements. For example, they occur in the first movement of Beethoven's Path√©tique Piano Sonata (Op. 13), to notate rapid scales. Another example is in Mozart's Variations on Je suis Lindor, where many of them are used in the slow twelfth variation.Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus. 12 Variations on 'Je suis Lindor', K.354. p. 10, fourth system, last bar. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Werke, Serie 21. Leipzig: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1877-1910. Plate W.A.M. 354. Likewise, 128th notes are used in the explicitly notated ornamental runs in the opening Adagio of Bach's g minor Sonata for Unaccompanied Violin (BWV 1001). These five-beamed notes also appear occasionally where a passage is to be performed rapidly, but where the actual tempo is at the discretion of the performer rather than being a strict division of the beat. In such cases, the aggregate time of the notes may not add up exactly to a full measure, and the phrase may be marked with an odd time division to indicate this. Sometimes such notation is made using smaller notes, sized like grace notes. One rare instance where such five-beamed notes occur as acciaccaturas occurs in the final measures of No. 2 of Charles- Valentin Alkan's Trois grandes √©tudes, Op. 76. Hundred twenty-eighth rests are also rare, but again not unknown. One is used in Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 13 \\"Quasi una fantasia\\" (bar 24 in the adagio movement) where it is followed by an ascending run of 128th notes.

One of the biggest professional wrestling stars in the beginning of the television era, Rogers's performances inspired future professional wrestlers, including \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair, who used Rogers's nickname, as well as his look, attitude and finishing hold, the figure-four leglock. Rogers was a two-time world champion, holding the top championship in both the NWA and the WWWF, today known as WWE (he was the inaugural WWWF World Heavyweight Champion). Rogers is one of three men in history to have held both world titles, along with Ric Flair and AJ Styles.  Early life  Rogers was the son of German immigrant parents. Rogers was athletic, and took up wrestling at age nine at the local YMCA. Rogers joined the Camden YMCA Wrestling League and won its heavyweight championship. He also excelled in football, boxing, track and swimming. In 1937, he won the YMCA's three-mile swimming championship. Rogers joined the Dale Brothers Circus as a wrestler at age 17. Rogers later worked at a shipyard, and became a police officer.  Professional wrestling career   Early career and National Wrestling Alliance (1939‚Äì1963)  Rogers visited the offices of professional wrestling promoters Ray and Frank Hanley, who gave him his first match on July 4, 1939 against Moe Brazen, which he won.Davies, Ross, Buddy Rogers (The Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., 2001), pp. 14-20. Rogers soon became a top professional wrestler using his real name around his hometown where he gained his first major win over Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis. He continued his career in Houston, where he assumed the name Buddy Rogers. Rogers would get his first title during his tenure there, winning the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship four times, once from Lou Thesz, beginning a long feud both in and out of the ring. After leaving the Texas territory for Columbus, Ohio, Rogers bleached his hair, and was given the moniker \\"Natural Guy\\" by promoter Jack Pfefer. The moniker later evolved to \\"Nature Boy\\". In the early 1950s, Lillian Ellison (under the moniker Slave Girl Moolah) worked as his valet. Ellison claims that the partnership ended after Rogers pushed for a sexual relationship, which Ellison refused. With the advent of television, Rogers's flashy look, great physique and bombastic personality instantly caught the ire of audiences. The first sign of Rogers's impact was his involvement in Sam Muchnick's opposition promotion in St. Louis, Missouri, a major professional wrestling market at the time. He was pitted against Lou Thesz as a draw. In the end, Muchnick's promotion was powerful enough with Rogers as its main star that the two promotions merged. Rogers continued control of the Midwest as a booker and professional wrestler, most notably in Chicago, frequently selling out the 11,000-seat arena. In the 1950s, Rogers expanded into Vince McMahon, Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC). He also wrestled in the Al Haft promotion out of Columbus, Ohio in the 1950s and through 1963. In 1961, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) voted him into an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. On June 30, 1961, Rogers took the title from Pat O'Connor in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, which set a new North American professional wrestling attendance record that stood until the David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions in 1984. In addition, the $148,000 gate in ticket sales was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The contest, which was a two out of three falls match, was billed as the \\"Match of the Century\\", during which both men had gained a pinfall. However, when O'Connor missed a dropkick and hit his head, Rogers pinned him to win the match and being recognized as the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. At the time, Rogers was working at two different jobs in Chicago, but he never walked into work again according to his autobiography. Many promoters felt that Rogers favored northeastern promoters over other territories. Promoters and noted shooters Bill Miller and Karl Gotch confronted Rogers in Columbus and broke his hand. Rogers sustained another injury in Montreal against Killer Kowalski, which kept Rogers on the sidelines. Upon his return, the NWA voted to switch the title back over to Lou Thesz, who publicly disliked Rogers. On January 24, 1963, the match took place in Toronto. Rogers was hesitant about dropping the title, so promoter Sam Muchnick put three safeguards in place to guarantee Rogers's cooperation. The first safeguard was formatting the match as a one fall finish, rather than the traditional best two out of three falls. The second safeguard was his threat to give Rogers's bond away to charity, rather than returning the deposit to the dethroned Rogers. Every NWA World Heavyweight Champion was required to pay a $25,000 deposit to the NWA Board of Directors, before winning the championship belt. The deposit was held by the NWA for the duration of the champion's reign. The third safeguard was Thesz, who could \\"take\\" the title if necessary. Ultimately, Thesz won the match and the title. Rogers was a co- holder of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with tag team partner \\"Handsome\\" Johnny Barend. They won the championship on July 5, 1962 from Johnny Valentine and ‚ÄúCowboy‚Äù Bob Ellis on Capitol Wrestling's regular Thursday night Washington, D.C. television show. Arnold Skaaland was a last minute replacement for Ellis whose flight was delayed and unable to get to the arena. With the championship on the line, Rogers and Barend isolated Skaaland whom Rogers forced to submit with his figure-four leglock to win the first fall. After Skaaland was carried from the ring on a stretcher, Valentine continued to fight alone in the second fall. Valentine fought valiantly, but was worn down by Rogers and Barend. Just when it looked like Valentine was going to succumb to the vicious attack of the heels the crowd erupted. The television cameras swung from a view of the ring to \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Ellis running down the aisle in street clothes and carrying a travel suitcase. Ellis jumped into the ring, applied multiple bulldog headlocks and pinned Barend to win the second fall for his team. The third fall featured everyone fighting inside and outside the ring. Finally, Ellis and Barend collided in the corner and knocked each other out. The referee was distracted by Valentine trying to get into the ring as Rogers grabbed an unconscious Barend by his hair and back of his trunks and threw him on top of Ellis for the victory. Rogers and Barend defeated Valentine and Ellis in a title rematch at Madison Square Garden on July 13, 1962. They defended the championship until March 7, 1963 when they lost to Killer Buddy Austin and The Great Scott on Capitol Wrestling's regular Thursday night television broadcast. Rogers and Barend split briefly and feuded, but they reunited that summer to defeat Bobo Brazil and Bruno Sammartino in a best two out of three falls tag team match. During the Rogers- Barend feud, Rogers regularly teamed with a masked wrestler, The Shadow. Prior to his title reign with Barend, Rogers frequently teamed with the \\"Big O\\" Bob Orton. During the 1950s, Rogers's main tag team partner was The Great Scott.  World Wide Wrestling Federation and semi-retirement (1963‚Äì1969)  After Thesz defeated Rogers for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Northeast promoters Toots Mondt and Vince McMahon, Sr. withdrew their membership from the NWA and formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE). The promoters felt that Thesz was not a strong draw in their territory, therefore the WWWF billed Rogers as their world champion as did Fred Kohler's Chicago promotion from January 25. Rogers was formally recognized as the first ever WWWF World Heavyweight Champion on April 11, 1963 when promoter and first WWWF President Willie Gilzenberg handed Rogers the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship belt on Washington D.C. television. Gilzenberg explained that Rogers won a wrestling tournament in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, although it was fictional. WWE.com currently cites April 25, 1963 as the beginning of Rogers's reign. Rogers was a top draw, but his reign was ultimately cut short by a mild heart attack which greatly hindered his endurance and in-ring performance. Vince McMahon, Sr. and Toots Mondt were in a panic and hid Rogers's medical problems. In an emergency title switch, Rogers put over Bruno Sammartino in a quick 48 second match on May 17, 1963 in Madison Square Garden. The match had to be kept short for fear of Rogers having a major heart attack and dying in the ring. After putting over Sammartino, his health problems forced Rogers to wrestle in only a limited number of short singles matches that lasted a minute or two. He participated in a few tag team matches with partner Handsome Johnny Barend where he spent almost the entire match in his corner on the ring apron while Barend did the wrestling. Rogers defeated Hans \\"The Great\\" Mortier in less than a minute with the figure-four leglock in Madison Square Garden and teamed with Handsome Johnny Barend to take two out of three falls via pin from Sammartino and Bobo Brazil, with Rogers pinning Sammartino for the final fall. The big rematch was to be held October 4, 1963 at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tickets were printed with Rogers‚ÄìSammartino on them. However, it was announced that Rogers was retiring and Gorilla Monsoon, who had won a tournament, got the title shot that night. In 1966-1967, Rogers wrestled in 18 short matches in Canada. In 1969, Rogers appeared in 19 quick matches in an Ohio-based promotion called Wrestling Show Classics before he realized his health was not getting better to the point where he could wrestle. He spent time on television talking with his former manager Bobby Davis. A decade later, Rogers would try to make a legitimate comeback.  Jim Crockett Promotions and return to WWF (1978‚Äì1992)  In 1979, Rogers returned to wrestling as a fan favorite in Florida, although he was in his late 50s. He later moved up to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the Carolinas as a villain manager managing professional wrestlers like Jimmy Snuka, Ken Patera, Gene Anderson, Dewey Robertson and Big John Studd. His most notable moment during his run in the Carolinas was his feud with the new \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair, before Rogers put over Flair on July 9, 1978. After his time in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW), he moved back into WWF where he was a fan favorite manager and part-time professional wrestler who also hosted the interview segment \\"Rogers' Corner\\" until 1983. Rogers was instrumental in helping turn Jimmy Snuka into a fan favorite, leading to Rogers managing Snuka for his feud with Lou Albano and Ray Stevens. During the feud, Rogers broke his hip and retired from professional wrestling for good. His show was replaced by \\"Victory Corner\\", which would later be replaced by \\"Piper's Pit\\". He would continue to make sporadic appearances in the WWF until 1984, right before the beginning of the Rock 'n' Wrestling era.  End of career and death  He was set to wrestle yet another \\"Nature Boy\\", this time Buddy Landel, in a comeback match for the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA, a predecessor of Extreme Championship Wrestling ‚Äì ECW) in early 1992, but the promotion went out of business and the match never occurred. Later in the year, Rogers was weakened by a severe broken arm and suffered three strokes, two on the same day. He was not put on life support (as per request)\\"Buddy Rogers, 71, Former Champion Wrestler\\" https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-1992-06-28-9202160859-story.html and died a short time afterward on June 26, 1992.  Legacy  Lou Thesz, Rogers's long-time colleague and frequent opponent, described Rogers's early impact in his memoir, Hooker: \\"Rogers is remembered by fans and performers alike as one of the top all-time stars in the business, but it's probably not common knowledge just how influential he was... he broke into the business somewhere around 1941 as a hero-type personality, with little more going for him than a good body and natural charisma in the ring ‚Äì which is actually a pretty good beginning ‚Äì and he was a hit almost from the start. He had that indefinable something fans responded to, and he was sharp enough to build upon what he had, paying attention to what got a reaction from the fans. What evolved over several years was the 'Nature Boy', the prototype of the cocky, strutting, sneering, arrogant peroxide blond villain that is almost a tired wrestling clich√© today. Rogers invented the character, and I believe he did it better than anyone\\". Thesz continued, \\"He was also one of the first guys to rely a lot on what we called 'flying' moves in the ring ‚Äì body slams, dropkicks, piledrivers, ricochets off the ropes into his opponent, action moves that are commonplace today. All of those moves were in use before Rogers came along, but they were used sparingly; most of the wrestling prior to Rogers's emergence was done on the mat. Rogers was the first to use flying moves in quantity, staying off the mat, and the style was so popular with the fans that other wrestlers, including me, followed his lead\\".Thesz, Lou, with Kit Bauman, Hooker: An Authentic Wrestler's Adventures Inside the Bizarre World of Professional Wrestling, Mike Chapman, Editor (TWC-Press, 2000), pp. 95-96. Another Rogers contribution to modern professional wrestling was his bombastic interviewing style. Professional wrestlers might talk and converse with interviewers, but Rogers bragged and boasted about how great he was and how pathetic his opponents were. After winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Pat O'Connor in Chicago in 1961, Rogers accepted the title belt and then took the microphone and shouted, \\"To a nicer guy it couldn't happen!\\". This type of bombastic style went over well with the fans and has been followed ever since. However, Rogers was not well liked during his prime years because he had a habit of taking advantage of opponents in the ring. During his prime years, he was known as much for his distinctive peacock-like strut as for his wrestling performance. He was also very skilled at drawing heat during interviews, with a smug \\"to a nicer guy, it couldn't have happened\\" being his catchphrase of sorts whenever he was victorious. He may have been the first authentic \\"charismatic\\" professional wrestler, who, along with almost equally charismatic Bobby Davis, would use cruel, yet hilarious, put-downs of his opponents, such as: \\"After I get through with him, he'll be back driving a garbage truck where he belongs\\". Almost like a tag team of pseudo-arrogance, Davis would incredulously say of Roger's opponents that they did not even deserve to be in the same ring as Rogers, bemoaning the fact that \\"this is a sport of kings!\\". Although he was viewed as a villain in most areas during most of his career, Rogers was always a fan favorite in cities throughout Ohio. This was probably due to his appearances for many years with the Al Haft Promotion who had their offices in Columbus. According to Thesz, Rogers, although admittedly an excellent professional wrestler and a superb showman, was a manipulative schemer behind the scenes and was fond of saying in private: \\"Screw your friends and be nice to your enemies, so your enemies will become your friends, and then you can screw them too\\".Thesz, Lou, with Kit Bauman, Hooker: An Authentic Wrestler's Adventures Inside the Bizarre World of Professional Wrestling, Mike Chapman, Editor (TWC-Press, 2000), p. 96. With age, however, Rogers mellowed and became a very respected veteran and spokesman for professional wrestling. Rogers had one of the longest consistent top drawing periods of any main eventer (15 years) and the ability to draw in several different territories successfully. In 1994, he was posthumously inducted into the World Wrestling Federation Hall of Fame class of 1994. Fellow professional wrestler Ric Flair from early in his career to the present day, adopted the \\"Nature Boy\\" gimmick from Rogers as a tribute to him. Even using Rogers's own signature move, the figure-four leglock, as his own, Flair even went as far as doing his own variation of the Rogers strut as well.

Its name is an acronym for Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator.RIVA 128 Brochure, Nvidia, accessed October 9, 2007. Following the less successful \\"NV1\\" accelerator, the RIVA 128 was the first product to gain Nvidia widespread recognition. It was also a major change in technological direction for Nvidia. Diamond Viper V330 4Mb @ RIVA 128 GPU ASUS RIVA 128ZX AGP Architecture RIVA 128 GPU RIVA 128ZX GPU Nvidia's \\"NV1\\" chip had been designed for a fundamentally different type of rendering technology, called quadratic texture mapping, a technique not supported by Direct3D. The RIVA 128 was instead designed to accelerate Direct3D to the utmost extent possible. It was built to render within the Direct3D 5 and OpenGL API specifications. The graphics accelerator consists of 3.5 million transistors built on a 350 nm fabrication process and is clocked at 100 MHz. RIVA 128 has a single pixel pipeline capable of 1 pixel per clock when sampling one texture. It is specified to output pixels at a rate of 100 million per second and 25-pixel triangles at 1.5 million per second. There is 12 KiB of on-chip memory used for pixel and vertex caches. The chip was limited to a 16-bit (Highcolor) pixel format when performing 3D acceleration and a 16-bit Z-buffer. The 2D accelerator engine within the RIVA 128 is 128 bits wide and also operates at 100 MHz. In this \\"fast and wide\\" configuration, as Nvidia referred to it, the RIVA 128 performed admirably for GUI acceleration compared to competitors.STB VELOCITY 128 REVIEW (PCI), Rage's Hardware, February 7, 1998. A 32-bit hardware VESA- compliant SVGA/VGA core was implemented as well. Video acceleration aboard the chip is optimized for MPEG-2 but lacks full acceleration of that standard. Final picture output is routed through an integrated 206 MHz RAMDAC. RIVA 128 had the advantage of being a combination 2D/3D graphics chip, unlike Voodoo Graphics. This meant that the computer did not require a separate 2D card for output outside of 3D applications. It also allowed 3D rendering within a window. The ability to build a system with just one graphics card, and still have it be feature-complete for the time, made the RIVA 128 a lower-cost high- performance solution. Nvidia equipped the RIVA 128 with 4 MiB of SGRAM, a new memory technology for the time, clocked at 100 MHz and connected to the graphics processor via a 128-bit memory bus. This provides memory bandwidth of 1.60 gigabytes per second. The memory was used in a unified memory architecture that shared the whole RAM pool with both framebuffer and texture storage. The main benefit of this, over a split design such as that on Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo¬≤, was support for 3D resolutions of 800√ó600 and 960√ó720, higher than Voodoo's 640√ó480.Review AGP Graphic Cards, Tom's Hardware, October 27, 1997. The RIVA 128 was one of the early AGP 2X parts, giving it some more marketing headroom by being on the forefront of interface technology. The graphics processor was built around Intel's AGP specification targeting the Intel 440LX chipset for the Pentium II. Nvidia designed the RIVA 128 with a maximum memory capacity of 4 MiB because, at the time, this was the cost- optimal approach for a consumer 3D accelerator.RIVA 128/ZX/TNT FAQ , Nvidia, accessed October 9, 2007. This was the case partly because of the chip's capability to store textures in off-screen system RAM in both PCI or AGP configurations. In early 1998, Nvidia released a refreshed version called the RIVA 128 ZX. This refreshed design of NV3 increased memory support to 8 MiB and increased RAMDAC frequency to 250 MHz. These additions allowed the RIVA 128 ZX to support higher resolutions and refresh rates.Covey, Alf. STB Velocity 128 vs STB Velocity 128zx What is the difference?, STB Technical Support, June 3, 1998. The ZX version uses an 8MB SGRAM memory chip, clocked at 125MHz, from Samsung Electronics. The next major chip from Nvidia would be the RIVA TNT. Image quality Quake II on RIVA 128 (final drivers) At the time of the RIVA 128's release, 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics had firmly established itself as the 3D hardware benchmark against which all newcomers were compared. The Voodoo was the first 3D game accelerator to offer exceptional performance and quality. The RIVA 128 was scorned for its lower quality rendering (compared to the Voodoo) and rendering errors. With initial drivers, the RIVA 128 used per-polygon mipmapping instead of the much higher-quality, but more demanding, per-pixel variety. This caused the different texture detail levels to \\"pop\\" into place as the player moved through a game and approached each polygon, instead of allowing a seamless, gradual per-pixel transition. Nvidia eventually released drivers that allowed a per-pixel mode. Another issue with the card's texturing was its use of automated mipmap generation. While this improves visual quality and performance in games without mipmaps, it also caused unforeseen problems because it forced games to render in a way that they were not programmed for. NV3's bilinear filtering was actually \\"sharper\\" than that of 3Dfx Voodoo Graphics. But, while it did not blur textures as much as Voodoo, it did instead add some light noise to textures, because of a lower-fidelity filtering algorithm. There were also problems with noticeable seams between polygons. While initial drivers did present these image-quality problems, later drivers offered image quality arguably matching that of Voodoo Graphics. In addition, because the RIVA 128 can render at resolutions higher than 640√ó480, the card can offer quality superior to that of Voodoo Graphics, as shown in the above Quake II screenshot. The final drivers released for the RIVA 128 support per-pixel mipmapping, full-scene anti-aliasing (supersampling), and a number of options to fine-tune features in order to optimize quality and performance.  Drivers and APIs  Drivers were, for a significant portion of the card's life, rather rough. Not only were the aforementioned Direct3D issues apparent, but the card lacked good OpenGL support. With RIVA 128, Nvidia began their quest for top-quality OpenGL support, eventually resulting in the board being a capable OpenGL performer. One major disadvantage for Nvidia was that many games during RIVA 128's lifetime used 3Dfx's proprietary Glide API. Legally, only 3Dfx cards could use 3Dfx's Glide API. Like the competing ATI Rage Pro, RIVA 128 was never able to accelerate the popular Unreal Engine in Direct3D mode due to missing hardware features. It was, however, possible to use the engine's OpenGL renderer, but unfortunately OpenGL support was quite slow and buggy in the original Unreal Engine. Performance in Quake III Arena, a game using an engine more advanced than Unreal Engine 1, was better due to the engine having been designed for OpenGL. Nvidia's final RIVA 128 drivers for Windows 9x include a full OpenGL driver. However, for this driver to function, Windows must be set with a desktop color depth of 16-bit. A driver for RIVA 128 is also included in Windows 2000 and XP, but lacks 3D support. A beta driver with OpenGL support was once leaked by Nvidia but was canceled later, and there is no Windows 2000 driver for RIVA 128 on Nvidia's driver site today. Neither the beta driver nor the ones come with Windows 2000/XP could support Direct3D.  Performance  At the time, RIVA 128 was one of the first combination 2D/3D cards that could rival Voodoo Graphics. RIVA 128's 2D capability was seen as impressive for its time and was competitive with even high-end 2D-only graphics cards in both quality and performance.

The first RIVA TNT based card was released on June 15, 1998 by STB Systems: Velocity 4400. RIVA is an acronym for Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator. The \\"TNT\\" suffix refers to the chip's ability to work on two texels at once (TwiN Texel). Overview The TNT was designed as a follow up to the RIVA 128 and a response to 3Dfx's introduction of the Voodoo2. It added a second pixel pipeline, practically doubling rendering speed, and used considerably faster memory. Unlike the Voodoo2 (but like the slower Matrox G200) it also added support for a 32-bit (truecolor) pixel format, 24-bit Z-buffer in 3D mode, an 8-bit stencil buffer and support for 1024√ó1024 pixel textures. Improved mipmapping and texture filtering techniques, including newly added support for trilinear filtering, dramatically improved quality compared to the TNT's predecessor. TNT also added support for up to 16 MiB of SDR SDRAM. Like RIVA 128, RIVA TNT is a single chip solution. Canopus RIVA TNT AGP ELSA Erazor II with Nvidia Riva TNT The TNT shipped later than originally planned, ran quite hot, and was clocked lower than Nvidia had planned at 90 MHz instead of 110 MHz. Originally planned specifications should have placed the card ahead of Voodoo2 in theoretical performance for Direct3D applications, but at 90 MHz it did not quite match the Voodoo2. At the time, most games supported 3dfx's proprietary Glide API which gave the Voodoo2 a large advantage in speed and image quality, and some games only used the Glide API for 3D acceleration, leaving TNT users no better off than people who didn't have a 3D accelerator. Even in \\"OpenGL only\\" comparisons such as the case in Quake 2, the Voodoo2 had the upper hand as a custom \\"MiniGL\\" driver was made specifically for 3dfx cards to run the game (and most other OpenGL games at the time). The 3dfx MiniGL driver was not a fully featured OpenGL driver, but a wrapper that mapped certain OpenGL functions to their equivalents in Glide, and was able to attain a speed advantage because of that. Later on when fully featured OpenGL drivers were made for the 3dfx line of cards, it was noticed that it was much slower when compared to its cut down MiniGL brother. The TNT had 32-bit color support while the Voodoo2 only supported 16-bit (although internally dithered down from 24-bit color, beating the TNT in 16bit quality). Voodoo2 cards also gained an even larger speed advantage over the TNT because of the ability to link two Voodoo2 cards together in an \\"SLI\\" setup. TNT did not match the sales of the incredibly popular Voodoo2. 3Dfx's customer mind share was at its peak during this time and Nvidia was still a somewhat new player. Again, like with the RIVA 128, the lack of Glide API support hindered Nvidia's opportunities for market share growth. Glide was still considered the best 3D gaming API available by both gamers and developers. However, TNT gained Nvidia much attention and paved the way for the refreshed version called the RIVA TNT2. After all, unlike the rest of the competition, Nvidia had come close to the Voodoo2 in performance in some games, and beaten it in 32bit image quality. Nvidia MS-8830 with Vanta graphic chip, standard video card in a Compaq Deskpro Evo office computer (2001) In what would become standard industry practice on a massive scale in later years, Nvidia released a budget version of TNT called Vanta. This board used the same TNT chip but lowered its clock speed and halved both memory data bus width (to 64-bit) and memory size (to 16 MiB). By doing this, Nvidia was able to still sell TNT chips that couldn't reach the TNT's specified clock speeds, a practice known as binning, and cut board costs significantly by using a narrower bus and less RAM. The board proved popular with OEM computer builders because of its capable feature-set and low price. Vanta also was implemented as integrated graphics on some motherboards. TNT itself was used on several popular cards, such as the Diamond Viper V550 and STB Velocity 4400, both of which managed OEM wins with the likes of Dell and Gateway, among others.  Drivers  Nvidia's driver development with TNT was the beginning of their notably aggressive efforts to maintain the best set of drivers possible. TNT received the first branded driver within the industry, called Detonator. These drivers were a huge success. While the TNT had always performed well on Intel based systems, it previously lagged behind in terms of performance on then current AMD based systems. At the time, Quake2 was the benchmark for performance and the 3dfx- made Voodoo2 enjoyed a large performance difference over the TNT because it had 3DNow! optimizations that negated the performance penalty of the weak, unpipelined FPU on then current AMD processors. The Detonator drivers included 3DNow! optimizations and the TNT's Quake2 performance jumped 30%. In fact, all OpenGL and DirectX applications benefited from such optimizations. This made the TNT a much more attractive 3D accelerator for AMD owners than previously. The Detonator drivers also fixed compatibility issues with motherboards of the time, and improved overall software compatibility. The TNT was the last Nvidia graphics accelerator to have support for Windows 3.1x.

At approximately 14,000 km¬≤, it covers approximately one-fifth of the area of the forest. Location The Nepoko, Ituri, and Epulu rivers flow through the reserve. The imposing Mbiya Mountain overlooks the Epulu village. The reserve is home to about 5,000 okapis, 4,000 elephants, 2,000 leopards, chimpanzees, and crocodiles. Other Ituri rain forest animals include forest buffalo and water chevrotain. The reserve has over 300 species of bird, and is one of the most important sites for bird conservation in mainland Africa. Nomadic Mbuti pygmies and indigenous Bantu farmers also live within the reserve. History The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was created with the help of the Okapi Conservation Project in 1992. The project continues to support the reserve by training and equipping wildlife guards and by providing assistance to improve the lives of neighboring communities. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1997. The main threats to the reserve are deforestation, primarily caused by slash and burn agriculture, and commercial hunting for the sale of bush meat. Gold mining has also been problematic to the Reserve. As of 2005, the fighting in the eastern part of the country moved within the boundaries of the Reserve, causing its staff to flee or be evacuated. Lack of funding due to the poor political and economic conditions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has also been problematic. It is hoped that eco-tourism to the area can be developed, leading to both increased funding and improved public awareness. Conservation As its name implies, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve is home to many okapis. As of 1996, the number was estimated at about 3900-6350, out of a global population of around 10,000-20,000. It is also the location of the Epulu Conservation and Research Center, on the Epulu River. This facility dates back to 1928 when the camp was founded by American anthropologist Patrick Putnam as a capture station, where wild okapis were captured and sent to American and European zoos. Until 2012 it still served that function, albeit with very different methodology, as the okapis remained in Congo. In 2012 a rebel attack left the center's captive okapis dead and it was decided to focus exclusively (at least as long as there were security concerns) on preserving the wild okapis in the reserve. The center also carries out much important research and conservation work. Rebel attacks Okapi On 24 June 2012, the Epulu Conservation and Research Center was attacked, looted and burned by a group of Mai-Mai rebels, lead by Paul Sadala (alias Morgan) and consisting of elephant poachers and illegal miners.Okapi Conservation Project (28 June 2012).Okapi Conservation Project, Epulu Update ‚Äì June 28, 2012 . Retrieved 15 September 2012 During the attack, 13 of the 14 okapis at the center were killed (the last died later of injuries sustained during the attack) and six people, including two wildlife rangers, were also killed. Many other locals, some minors, were abducted, but all were released later.Mongobay (9 September 2013).A year after devastating attack, security returns to the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (photos).

The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of Mad Libs books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958. History Mad Libs was invented in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. Stern and Price co-created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when Stern and Price were eating Eggs Benedict at a restaurant in New York City. While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor. According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to \\"ad-lib\\" an upcoming interview. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be \\"mad\\". Stern and Price used that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name \\"Mad Libs\\". In 1958, the duo released the first book of Mad Libs, which resembled the earlier games of consequences and exquisite corpse. Stern was head writer and comedy director for The Steve Allen Show, and suggested to the show's host that guests be introduced using Mad Libs completed by the audience. Four days after an episode introduced \\"our guest NOUN, Bob Hope\\", bookstores sold out of Mad Libs books. Stern and Price next partnered with Larry Sloan, a high school friend who was working as a publicist at the time, to continue publishing Mad Libs. Together, the three founded the publishing firm Price Stern Sloan in the early 1960s as a way to release Mad Libs. In addition to releasing more than 70 editions of Mad Libs under Sloan, the company also published 150 softcover books, including such notable titles as How to Be a Jewish Mother, first released in 1964; Droodles, which was also created by Roger Price; The VIP Desk Diary; and the series World's Worst Jokes. Price died in 1990, and three years later, Sloan and Stern sold Price Stern Sloan, including Mad Libs, to the former Putnam Berkley Group, which is now known as Penguin Random House. Mad Libs books are still published by Penguin Random House; however, all references to Price Stern Sloan have been removed from the company's official website. Stern died at age 88 on June 7, 2011, and Sloan on October 14, 2012. More than 110 million copies of Mad Libs have been sold since the game series was first published in 1958. Format Mad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as \\"noun\\", \\"verb\\", \\"place\\", \\"celebrity,\\" \\"Exclamation\\" or \\"part of the body\\". One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and/or takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone. Stern and Price's original Mad Libs book gives the following sentence as an example: \\"___! he said  as he jumped into his convertible  and drove off with his _ wife.\\" exclamation adverb noun adjective After completion, they demonstrate that the sentence might read: \\" _Ouch_! he said _stupidly_ as he jumped into his convertible _cat_ and drove off with his _brave_ wife.\\" Books *Dysfunctional Family Therapy (Mad Libs) ‚Äì *Night of the Living Mad Libs (Mad Libs)- *Once Upon A Mad Libs Junior (Mad Libs Junior) ‚Äì *Mad Libs 40th Anniversary Edition (Mad Libs) ‚Äì *Mad Libs 50th Anniversary Edition (Mad Libs) *I Love My Pets Mad Libs Junior *Hatchimals Mad Libs Junior *Sports Star Mad Libs Junior (Mad Libs Junior) ‚Äì *School Rules!

This album is historic since it is one of the first space rock LPs. Recording The Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor, who was looking for a new venture after leaving the band, was pulled into Hawkwind playing some gigs and producing this album. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture the band's sound in the studio, it was decided simply to record it live in the studio. Songs The bulk of the album is composed of a freeform instrumental piece that the band named \\"Sunshine Special\\" but it was separated into different tracks on this album. On the LP, \\"Paranoia\\" ends after the first minute with the music slowing down as though the turntable is stopping, and then picks up as the first cut on Side 2. Lyrics are scant, but those that are present and the song titles are a reference to the drug experience, as the sleeve notes explain: > This is the beginning. By now we will be past this album. We started out > trying to freak people (trippers), now we are trying to levitate their > minds, in a nice way, without acid, and ultimately a completely audio-visual > thing. Using a complex of electronics, lights and environmental experiences. The two bookend pieces of \\"Hurry on Sundown\\" and \\"Mirror of Illusion\\" are more of a nod to Brock's alternative activity of busking and were released as a single in edited form. Sleeve The cover is a fantasy painting that shows several dragon figures emerging from piles of leaves that also spell out the name of the band. On the front cover, the dragons are shown with human arms, while the reverse cover shows a dragon's head as an automobile with a driver wearing sunglasses.Collectable Records ‚Äì Original gatefold cover Adverts for the album proclaimed Hawkwind Is Space Rock. Critical reaction Mark Plummer from Melody Maker reviewed the album in the context of electronic music as \\"interesting and exciting.

The chip is codenamed \\"NV5\\" because it is the 5th graphics chip design by Nvidia, succeeding the RIVA TNT (NV4). RIVA is an acronym for Real- time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator.RIVA 128 Brochure, Nvidia, accessed October 9, 2007. The \\"TNT\\" suffix refers to the chip's ability to work on two texels at once (TwiN Texel).TNT2, Nvidia, accessed October 12, 2007. Nvidia removed RIVA from the name later in the chip's lifetime. Overview RIVA TNT2 VANTA GPU The TNT2 core features the same basic dual- pipeline layout as the RIVA TNT, however with a few updates, such as larger 2048x2048 texture support, 32-bit Z-buffer/stencil support, AGP 4X support, up to 32MB of VRAM, and a process shrink from 0.35 Œºm to 0.25 Œºm. It was the process shrink that enabled improved clock speeds (from 90 MHz to 150+ MHz), which is where the substantial performance improvement came from. A low-cost version, known as the TNT2 M64, was produced with the memory interface reduced from 128-bit to 64-bit. Sometimes these were labeled \\"Verto\\", continuing the Verto name started with a value-oriented RIVA TNT-based product. This chipset outperformed the older RIVA TNT while being less costly to produce. They proved quite popular in the OEM market, as most consumers simply assumed all TNT2 cards were the same. Product comparisons Canopus RIVA TNT2 Ultra RIVA TNT2's competition included the 3dfx Voodoo2, 3dfx Voodoo3, the Matrox G400, and the ATI Rage 128.Lal Shimpi, Anand. Nvidia Riva TNT2, Anandtech, April 27, 1999. The main competitor to the TNT2 was the Voodoo3, which compared to the TNT2 lacked 32-bit color output in 3D. This was a distinguishing point for the TNT2, while the Voodoo3 was marketed under the premise of superior speed and game compatibility. The 3dfx Glide API was still popular at this time, and frequently performed faster and with better image quality than non-vendor locked APIs Direct3D and OpenGL. Some games also had exclusive 3D features when used with Glide, including Wing Commander: Prophecy, and the popular Unreal had a troubled development history with regards to Direct3D and was plagued by issues such as missing details in this mode. Voodoo3 cards render internally in 32-bit precision color depth. This is dithered down for the 16-bit framebuffer, which is then postprocessed by a 2x2 box filter in the RAMDAC, dubbed \\"22-bit equivalent\\" output by marketing. While this results in markedly less dithering than TNT2's 16-bit output, it is not equivalent to real 32-bit output. The postprocessed nature of the effect also meant that framebuffer captures did not display it, which lead to erroneous claims equating TNT2 16-bit quality to Voodoo3 when in many titles of the day Voodoo3 16-bit quality was closer to TNT2 32-bit quality in practice.Beets, Kristof. 3dfx 22-bit Rendering Explored, Beyond 3D, April 27, 2007. 32-bit rendering became much more important with heavier use of alphablending and multipass effects in games, however. Chaintech A-MX20 nVidia TNT2 (ca. 2001) The Voodoo3 and TNT2 also differ in that the Voodoo3 has a single dual-texturing pipeline (1x2), while the TNT2 has two single-texturing pipelines (2x1). This means that in games which only put a single texture on a polygon face at once, the TNT2 can be more efficient and faster. However, when TNT2 was launched, single-texturing was no longer used in most new games. One fact that many hardware review sites noted was that the TNT2 could still be outperformed by two 3dfx Voodoo2 running in SLI mode.Pabst, Thomas. NVIDIA rocks the Boat with TNT2, Tom's Hardware, March 12, 1999.Hwang, Kenn. Exclusive Pentium III Review, Firing Squad, January 13, 1999. In games that supported the Glide API, Voodoo2 SLI setups were able to consistently perform faster and offer better image quality than the TNT2. Voodoo2 cards were more than a year old, but, when combined together, could still outperform then-current Nvidia technology. Variants Diamond Multimedia Viper V770 AGP, 32 MB video memory Falcon Northwest, a high-end PC company, and Guillemot, an international video card manufacturer, at one point cooperated to create the Falcon Northwest Special Edition Maxi Gamer Xentor 32 SE. It was a TNT2 Ultra card designed to operate at a record-breaking 195 MHz core and similarly impressive 235 MHz RAM. This was far and away the highest clocked TNT2 model released. The card used special extremely low latency (for the time) 4.3 ns SDRAM to achieve the high RAM clock speed.Freeman, Vince. Falcon Northwest Special Edition Xentor Review, Sharky Extreme, November 12, 1999. The regular Maxi Gamer Xentor 32 came with the core clocked at 175 MHz and memory at either 183 MHz or 195 MHz, depending on which RAM chips the board arrived with.\\"HSREVIEWS: TNT2 Round-Up\\" _PC Gamer_ October 1999: 190. The Creative 3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra came clocked at the standard 150 MHz core and 183 MHz RAM. However, Creative included a unique software package that allowed the user to run software that used 3dfx's Glide. This wrapper, named Unified, was not as compatible with Glide games as real 3dfx hardware, but it was also the only card available other than a 3dfx card that could run Glide software. This Glide wrapper was very slow, not without issues, and was rather unstable. TNT2 Glide - Creative Labs Unified, Guru of 3D, accessed July 5, 2007. The main use of the wrapper was to allow 3D acceleration of games that only supported Glide 3D accelerators. Hercules equipped their Dynamite TNT2 Ultra with faster-than-stock components, as well. The card came with a 175 MHz core clock and 200 MHz memory. The card lacked TV output, however. ELSA's Erazor III came clocked at non-Ultra TNT2 rates but included \\"3D Revelator\\" shutter glasses. These glasses made games look as though they were coming out of the screen, and worked with both Direct3D and some OpenGL titles. Aladdin TNT2 chipset ALi integrated the RIVA TNT2 core into the motherboard chipset Aladdin TNT2. The northbridge ALi M1631 with graphic core was commonly paired with a M1535D southbridge and was prepared for the low-cost Socket 370 motherbards. Aladdin TNT2 offers support for both a local frame buffer (4-32MB) as well as unified memory mode. Frame buffer memory operated at 150MHz and used 64-bit bus. External AGP 4x port for the separate graphic card was lacked. With the local frame buffer integrated TNT2 core offered similar speed compared to the separate TNT2 M64 AGP cards. Main motherboard manufacturers like Asus prepared boards with the Aladdin TNT2 and local memory. But solution was mostly known from low-cost and low-quality boards without separate memory. Boards like PC-CHIPS M754LMR (used chipset relabelled to PC133 GfX Pro) were known for both low speed and low stability.

Appearances in other media  In Dragon Ball GT, Yamcha makes two cameo appearances.Dragon Ball GT, episodes 40, \\"Piccolo's Decision\\" and 64, \\"Until We Meet Again...\\" Yamcha is the main subject of the spin-off manga . Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the Dragon Ball manga. He trains as Yamcha to make him the strongest warrior, having known what happens to him later in the manga against the Saiyans. Yamcha is a playable character in multiple Dragon Ball-related video games, including the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai series, the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series, and Dragon Ball FighterZ. Yamcha also appears in an unofficial Chinese live-action remake of the first Dragon Ball feature film, played by Cheng Tung-Chuen. Here he is known as Westwood. He joins Monkey Boy, Sparkle, Turtle Man and Seeto in the quest to destroy King Horn and his powerful warriors. He was played by Korean pop singer Joon Park in the film Dragonball Evolution, for which James Kyson Lee also auditioned.  Reception and legacy  Yamcha has had mixed reviews during his inception. He is commonly described as useless and outclassed as a fighter in the Dragon Ball series yet has also been described as fun and an iconic anime character to other publishers. A few have noted that his most highlighted moments in the anime was in the original anime adaptation compared to the more popular Dragon Ball Z anime. In 2004, Japanese fans voted Yamcha the fifteenth most popular character of the series. He was ranked as the thirty-eighth greatest Dragon Ball Z character of all time by Complex describing his willing to sacrifice himself as being the best part of his character. Yamcha is commonly joked about as one of the weaker fighters by fans of the series. When younger fans would belittle the character as weak, Krillin's voice actress Mayumi Tanaka said she would explain to them that Krillin and Yamcha are the strongest earthlings, the other characters are all aliens. Despite this, he has been used as a joke that appears in internet memes, T-shirts and action figures, especially regarding his initial death which has been described as \\"iconic\\" and is subject to many parodies and homages. So much so that online writers such as Moviepilot's Ak Khan Ten's described him as an \\"iconic troll legend\\". He felt that despite being a weaker fighter he still is an important character from the Dragon Ball mythos since the creation of the manga and felt that he deserves respect as \\"an iconic Dragon Ball character\\". He also described Yamcha as Goku's first real rival in the series. He also praised the revealing of him mastering the Spirit Ball technique and also him being the first one who realized that he should cut Goku's tail to stop Goku in ape form. Yamcha's initial death has inspired a phrase by fans on when somebody dies in the Dragon Ball universe as being \\"Yamcha'd\\". T≈çru Furuya has been Yamcha's Japanese voice actor in every single piece of Dragon Ball media. Furuya, the character's voice actor, designates Yamcha as one of the characters by whom he was inspired to create his music, as well as one of the top six favorite characters he voiced. Rebecca Bundy of Anime News Network takes note of resemblance of scars between Yamcha and Kenshin Himura, but also observes that their meaning is quite different. He has expressed disatissfaction for the way Akira Toriyama handled his character on multiple occasions. The first was the way Yamcha was murdered by a Saibaman despite his constant training during the Saiyan Arc which made him a supporting character in following arcs. The second time he was shocked with Yamcha's development was when it was the revealed when the characters Trunks was Bulma's and Vegeta's child from the future despite the fact that Yamcha and Bulma were often in a relationship and Yamcha was turned into a cheater to cause such change. Hiromi Tsuru, Bulma's first Japanese actress, was also shocked by this change, believing her character would end with Yamcha. This caused Furuya to protest against Toriyama who said that Yamcha was always a cheater while laughing.2004, TV Anime Guide: Dragon Ball Tenka‚Äôichi Densetsu  References   Bibliography  *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 1 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 2 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 3 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 10 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 15 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball manga, Volume 16 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 5 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 12 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 13 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 18 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 20 ‚Äî *Dragon Ball Z manga, Volume 26 ‚Äî Category:Dragon Ball characters Category:Animated human characters Category:Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Category:Anime and manga martial artists Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984 Category:Fictional baseball players Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities Category:Fictional thieves Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Martial artists characters in films ","title":"Yamcha"},{"id":"565730","text":"Ovadia Yosef (, ; September 24, 1920 ‚Äì October 7, 2013) was an Iraqi-born Talmudic scholar, a posek, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1973 to 1983, and a founder and long-time spiritual leader of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas party. Yosef's responsa were highly regarded within Haredi circles, particularly among Mizrahi communities, among whom he was regarded as \\"the most important living halakhic authority\\". On occasion, Yosef made statements relating to various groups and individuals which were deemed controversial by his critics. In response, supporters of Yosef claimed he was misquoted or his words taken out of context. What has been called \\"hate speech\\" on his part has been condemned by the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League. Biography Ovadia Yosef as a child with his family. Ovadia Yosef in his youth. Early life Yosef was born in Baghdad, Ottoman Iraq, to Yaakov Ben Ovadia and his wife, Gorgia. In 1924, when he was four years old, he immigrated to Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, with his family. In Palestine, the family adopted the surname \\"Ovadia\\". Later in life, Ovadia Yosef changed his surname to be his middle name, \\"Yosef\\", to avoid the confusion of being called \\"Ovadia Ovadia\\". The family settled in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem, where Yaakov operated a grocery store. The family was poor, and Yosef was forced to work at a young age. He learned in Talmud Torah B'nei Zion in the Bukharim quarter, where his passion and skill for Torah study was apparent. His literary career began already at age 9, with a commentary on Reshit Chochmah, which he penned in the margins.\\"Biography of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef\\" , Hebrew; Achdut-Israel In 1933, Hakham Sadqa Hussein prevailed upon Yaakov to send his son to Porat Yosef Yeshiva. He soon advanced to the highest shiur taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya. A story is told about how Attiya was instrumental in keeping Yosef in the Torah world. At one point, the diligent young scholar suddenly stopped coming to yeshiva for several days. Attiya paid a visit to his home, and was shocked by the poverty he saw there. Yosef's father explained that he needed the boy to work for him. Attiya attempted to convince the father of the importance of Torah learning, to no avail. The next morning, when the father entered his store, he found Attiya standing there, wearing a work apron. The rosh yeshiva explained that he had come to the store early that morning when Yosef was opening up. He had told the youth that he had found a substitute worker who would work without pay, and sent him back to yeshiva. \\"You said that you needed someone to help and could not afford to pay. I am that someone. Your son's learning is more important than my time!\\", he told the father, who finally conceded and allowed his son to continue learning in yeshiva. Yosef soon composed his first sefer, together with two friends, called Machberet Ha'atakat Hidot. In 1937, Rabbi Yaakov Dweck sent Yosef to give the daily Ben Ish Hai halakha shiur in his stead at the Ohel Rachel Synagogue for the Persian Jewish community in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood. In the course of giving this shiur, Yosef dissented many times with the stringent opinions of the Ben Ish Hai, who preferred the rulings of the Ari zal over Yosef Karo. This was a defining moment for Yosef, who had found a podium to give air to his opinions, while simultaneously learning how to deal with the negative feedback he was receiving from many in his audience, especially from his fellow Iraqi Jews. A number of notable rabbis, among them Yitzhak Nissim, rebuked him over the years for his positions, even burning his first halakha sefer, Hazon Ovadia. But Rabbi Attiya encouraged his student to continue ruling according to his own understanding. Yosef's objections on Ben Ish Hai, for many years in handwritten form only, were printed beginning in 1998 with the appearance of his Halikhot Olam. Yosef received rabbinic ordination at the age of 20. He became a long-time friend of several members of his class who went on to prominent leadership positions in the Sephardi world, such as Rabbi Ben Zion Abba Shaul, Rabbi Baruch Ben Haim, Rabbi Yehuda Moallem and Rabbi Zion Levy.  Residing in Egypt  In 1947, Yosef was invited to Cairo by Rabbi Aharon Choueka, the founder of yeshiva 'Ahavah VeAchvah', to teach in his yeshiva.Minhat Aharon, Y. Choueka and Haym Sabato (Eds.), Jerusalem, 1980, pp. 15‚Äì32. Yosef also served, at the request of Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, as head of the Cairo beth din (rabbinical court). Yosef found that religious observance was lax in Egypt, be it the Jewish community at large, or even its Rabbis. One of the major Halachic issues was the lack of any organised system of Kashrut, which led to conflict between him and other members of the community. It was due to these events that Yosef resigned from his position, just two years after arriving in Cairo. Approximately one year later he returned to what in the meantime had become Israel.  Return to Israel  Back in Israel, Yosef began studying at midrash \\"Bnei Zion\\", then headed by Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank. He also served on the rabbinical court in Petah Tikva. His boldness as a posek was already revealed in his first term as a dayan when, at the age of 30, he wrote a Halachic ruling favoring Yibbum over Halitza, which contradicted a religious ruling made by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel a year earlier, which had forbidden Yibbum. In 1951‚Äì1952 (◊™◊©◊ô\\"◊ë by the Jewish calendar), he published his first halakha sefer, Hazon Ovadia on the laws of Passover. The book won much praise, and received the approval of the two Chief Rabbis of Israel at the time, Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. Two years later he founded 'Or HaTorah' Yeshiva for gifted Sephardic Yeshiva students. This Yeshiva (which did not remain open for long) was the first of many which he established, later with the help of his sons, in order to facilitate Torah education for Sephardic Jews, in order to provide leadership for the community in future generations. In 1953-4 (◊™◊©◊ô\\"◊ì) and 1955-6 (◊™◊©◊ò\\"◊ñ), he published the first two volumes of his major work Yabia Omer, which also received much praise. Between 1958 and 1965, Yosef served as a dayan in the Jerusalem district Beth Din. He was then appointed to the Supreme Rabbinical Court of Appeals in Jerusalem, eventually becoming the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Tel Aviv in 1968, a position which he held until his election as Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel in 1973.  Rishon LeZion  In 1973, Yosef was elected Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel by a majority vote of 81 to 68, replacing Yitzhak Nissim. His candidacy was criticised by some, as he was competing against an incumbent Chief Rabbi for the first time in the history of that office. The election process was characterised by tension and political controversy because of the Psak Din of the Brother and Sister, and due to the tense relations between Yosef and Nissim. In the same election, Rabbi Shlomo Goren was chosen as the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, the relationship with whom would prove to be difficult. The Council of the Chief Rabbinate was controlled by Goren, and for some time thereafter Yosef decided that there would be no point in attending its sessions.  Entry into politics  In 1984, Yosef founded the Shas party, in response to minimal representation of Sephardic Jews in the Ashkenazi-dominated Agudat Yisrael. It has since become a formidable political force, becoming part of the coalition in most of the elected governments since. He later took a less active role in politics, but remained the party's spiritual leader until his death.  Assassination plot  In April 2005, Israeli security services arrested three people whom the Shin Bet claimed were all members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). They were accused of plotting to kill Yosef. One of the three, Musa Darwish, was convicted on December 15, 2005 of Yosef's attempted murder, and of throwing firebombs at vehicles on the Jerusalem- Ma'aleh Adumim road. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and three years probation. A second man, Salah Hamouri, proclaimed his innocence of the charges, but eventually accepted a plea bargain sentence of 7 years in exchange for admitting his guilt.  Family  When Yosef was 24, he married Margalit Fattal (1927‚Äì1994), born in Syria, daughter of Rabbi Avraham HaLevi Fattal, when she was 17. They had eleven children. # Adina Bar-Shalom, (b. 1946) is the founder of the first academic college for Haredi women in Jerusalem, and she studied design at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, both with the approval of her father.

He was appointed to Moetzet Chachmei HaTorah after his father died. # Leah Butbul # Moshe Yosef, (b. 1966), a rabbi married to Yehudit. Both lived and cared for Yosef in his apartment. Moshe is the head of the Badatz Beit Yosef kashrut agency, and the head of the Maor Yisrael talmud torah, which also publishes the works of his father.  Final years and death  Yosef resided in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Har Nof. He remained an active public figure in political and religious life in his capacity as the spiritual leader of the Shas political party, and through his regular weekly sermons. He was referred to as the Posek HaDor (\\"Posek of the present generation\\"), Gadol HaDor (\\"great/est (one of) the generation\\"), Maor Yisrael (\\"The Light of Israel\\"), and Maran. On January 13, 2013, Yosef collapsed during Shacharit at his synagogue in Har Nof, Jerusalem and was having difficulty using his left hand. After he was seen by a physician in his home, he was hospitalized at Hadassah Medical Center after suffering what was believed to be a minor stroke. On 21 September 2013, because of his worsening health, Yosef was admitted to Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. Two days after undergoing surgery for the implantation of a pacemaker on September 22, Yosef was sedated and placed on a respirator. He died in the hospital on 7 October 2013 after a \\"general systemic failure\\". His funeral in Jerusalem was the largest in Israel's history, with an estimated attendance of 850,000. Some religious authorities have stated that this was, perhaps, the largest in- gathering of Jews since the days of the Second Temple. However, other estimates put the number in attendance at the funeral lower, at between 273,000 and 450,000.‚ÄòOnly‚Äô 450,000 at Yosef funeral, some experts claim By Adiv Sterman and Gavriel Fiske, October 9, 2013, Times of Israel He was buried beside his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. During the week-long shiva mourning period, Yosef's family were expected to receive thousands of condolence callers in a mourning tent set up on their Har Nof street, which police closed to vehicular traffic. Security guards were also posted at the cemetery, where Yosef's grave quickly became a pilgrimage site for thousands of men and women.  Halakhic approach and worldview   Meta-Halakha: Restoring the past glory  Yosef frequently made use of the slogan \\"Restore past glory\\" (◊ú◊î◊ó◊ñ◊ô◊® ◊¢◊ò◊®◊î ◊ú◊ô◊ï◊©◊†◊î) as a metaphor embodying both his social and halakhic agenda. On a social level, it is widely viewed as a call to pursue a political agenda that will restore the pride of the Mizrahi Jews (Jews from the Middle East) in Israeli society, which historically suffered from discrimination, and were generally of a lower socio-economic status than their Ashkenazi counterparts. From a halakhic perspective, the metaphor is more complex. It is widely agreed by Rabbis and secular researchers alike that the 'crown' of the metaphor refers to the halakhic supremacy which Yosef attaches to the rulings of Rabbi Yosef Karo. According to Yosef's approach, Karo is crowned as the Mara D'atra of the Land of Israel, and thus all Jews living within his realm of authority should be bound by his rulings.Lau, B: \\"From 'Maran' to 'Maran'\\" (Hebrew), page 14. Miskal ‚Äì Yedioth Ahronoth Books and Chemed Books, 2005. Yosef says this explicitly and in very strong terms in Yalkut Yosef (note that 'Maran' refers to Rabbi Yosef Karo): However, there remains some disagreement over who exactly Yosef considers to be bound by the rulings of Karo. Rabbi Ratzon Arusi argues that Yosef distinguishes between his ideal and the reality. Ideally, all Jews of the Land of Israel should be bound by Karo's rulings, but practicality dictates that first all of the Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews should unite under them first. As Arusi puts it, Tzvi Zohar argues that Yosef adopts a melting pot approach, in that he seeks to unify the traditions of all Jews in Israel, Sephardic and Ashkenazi alike. Zohar claims that Yosef's main distinction is not between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, but between the Land of Israel and the Diaspora. In his view, Yosef seeks to apply the rulings of Karo on the entire Land of Israel, but not necessarily outside of it. According to Zohar, this represents an anti-Diaspora and \\"anti-Colonialist\\" approach, since it seeks to strip the various immigrant communities of their traditions from their countries of origin and replace them with the custom of the Land of Israel, rather than importing and implanting foreign customs in Israel. He compares between Yosef and religious reformers such as Martin Luther and Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, and claims that Yosef has adopted a religious restorative-reformist worldview. Specifically, he argues that Yosef's halakhic approach is not, as Yosef attempts to portray it, a return to a traditional form of Sephardic ruling, but rather an innovative formulation of a particular Sephardic approach to Halakha which Yosef himself fashioned.Zohar, T: Hairu Pnei Hamizrach (Hebrew), page 351. Hakibutz HaMeuhad. Rabbi Binyamin Lau disagrees with both of the preceding interpretations. According to Lau, Yosef claims that all Sephardic Jews accepted the rulings of Karo as binding in the Diaspora, but over time deviated from them. Presently, upon their return to the Land of Israel where Karo is the Mara D'atra, they should return to adhering to his rulings. Thus, Lau believes that Yosef directs his rulings only at Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, since the Ashkenazi Jews never accepted upon themselves the rulings of Karo. Lau views Yosef as operating on two fronts: the first against the Ashkenazi leadership which seeks to apply Ashkenazi rulings and customs to the Sephardim, and the second against the Sephardic and Mizrahi communities themselves, in demanding that they unite under the rulings of Karo.Lau, B: \\"From 'Maran' to 'Maran'\\". Miskal ‚Äì Yedioth Ahronoth Books and Chemed Books, 2005. In any case, it is agreed that alongside the conservative aspects of his approach to Halacha, there are also significant reforms: his preference for the rulings of Karo, and his preference for leniency over chumra. The fulfillment of his Halakhic vision has entailed significant clashes with his Ashkenazi counterparts. On his predecessors in the post of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa Rabbinate, Yosef wrote:  Preference for leniency  Yosef adopted the Talmudic dictum that, \\"The power of leniency is greater\\". Therefore, one of his fundamental principles of halakhic ruling is that lenient rulings should be preferred over chumra. Yosef saw this as one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Sephardic approach to Halakha, compared to the Ashkenazi approach. In one of his rulings, he quoted Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai as saying: Yosef considered this principle an ideal, so that if In Yosef's opinion, the severity of Ashkenazi poskim results from their method of teaching, and a lack of familiarity with the Mishnah, Talmud and poskim. In a 1970 article Yosef wrote about Rabbi Jacob Saul Elyashar, he says: Yosef regarded ruling with severity as especially harmful in the current generation (\\"the generation of freedom and liberty\\"), since strict ruling might lead individuals not to comply with the Halakha. Writing in Yabia Omer, he says: \\"And truly, the growth of chumrot leads to leniency in the body of the Torah.\\"  Examples of lenient rulings  Following this principle of leniency Yosef made a number of Halakhic rulings which are significantly more lenient than those made by his Ashkenazi Haredi counterparts. Among them are: * That it is permissible for boys and girls to study together up to the age of 9. * That a married woman who covers her hair may expose a few centimeters hair from beneath the covering at the front. * That it is permissible for a female widow or divorc√©e to wear a wig as a head covering, despite prohibiting it for married women (see below). * That it is permissible for unmarried women to leave their hair loose and untied.  The least of evils  Yosef aimed to encourage maximal observance of Mitzvot among as many Israelis as possible. In order to achieve this, \\"he is willing to follow a halakhic policy which, on the one hand, will minimize violations of the halakha, but on the other, concedes absolute adherence to the halakha\\". This is evident in a number of his rulings: providing kashrut certification to a restaurant that serves milk and meat; the slaughter of a chicken where there is a concern of it being trefa; and the wearing of pants by women.  Turning a blind eye  Yosef applied a policy of turning a blind eye to deviations from the halakha in circumstances where, if strict adherence to the halakha were required, it is likely that it would not be followed at all. Examples of this include the recital of the priestly benediction by Kohanim who do not have a religious lifestyle, and a shaliach tzibur or person performing a Torah reading who shaves with a razor.  Sinai Adif  In the Talmudic debate over Sinai and Oker Harim, Yosef was of the opinion that Sinai is preferable. Specifically, he emphasizes that the Sephardic system of learning, which emphasizes learning Halakha in depth, is superior to the common approach in many Ashkenazi schools, which relies on deep analysis of gemara employing pilpul, without reaching to the halakhic conclusions. This preference is based upon his support for ruling halakha on practical contemporary issues rather than ruling halakha as a purely theoretical pursuit. In a eulogy he wrote for Rabbi Yaakov Ades, his teacher at Porat Yosef Yeshiva, he said: According to Yosef, the preoccupation with pilpul at the expense of learning halakha in depth causes lack of knowledge among Ashkenazi poskim, which in turn leads to unnecessary severity in making halakhic rulings, since the Posek is unaware of lenient rulings and approaches to Halakha used by previous Rabbis upon which the Posek could rely to rule leniently.  Attitude towards kabbalah  Yosef was sometimes willing to accept rulings which rely on the rulings of the Ari zal, provided that these do not contradict rulings by Karo. Nevertheless, in many cases, he came out strongly against the rulings, saying, \\"We have no business with mysticism\\", and rejecting rulings based upon the Zohar, and the Kabbalah more generally. This position is contrary to many (but not all) traditional long-standing Sephardic rulings on Halakha, including by many Sephardic poskim to this day. In contrast with the position of Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai, who wrote that, \\"None may reply after the Ari\\" (that is, none may dispute the rulings of the Ari), Yosef argues that no special weight should be attached to the rulings of the Ari, and the ordinary principles of Halakhic ruling should continue to apply. He wrote: Yosef's attitude towards the Kabbalah, the rulings of the Ari, and consequently the rulings of the Ben Ish Hai have been the cause of strong disagreements between him and Jewish immigrants from the Muslim world in Israel, especially the Jews of Iraq. The rulings of the Ben Ish Chai were at the heart of the disagreement between him and the Chief Rabbis Yitzhak Nissim and Mordechai Eliyahu.  Attitude towards minhag and traditions  Yosef gave strong preference to the written word, and did not attribute significant weight to minhagim and traditions which are not well anchored in the Halakha. For example, he expressed opposition to two minhagim observed in the Synagogues of North African Jewry: standing during the reading of the Ten Commandments, and the involvement of the congregation in certain parts of the prayer service. His attempts to change popular and deeply rooted traditions have led to opposition to his approach among some North African Rabbis. Breslov Hasidim have the custom of going on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov in Uman for Rosh Hashanah. Yosef has been highly critical of this practice, and has stated:  Attitude towards the State of Israel and its citizens   Ethiopian Jews  Ovadia Yosef is often regarded as the pivotal force behind bringing Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In the 1970s, Yosef ruled that Ethiopian Jews were halachically Jewish and campaigned for the Ethiopian aliyah to Israel. Pnina Tamano-Shata said of Yosef: \\"I started crying, probably in gratitude to all that he's done, the humane form of address, 'our brothers.' He was also a leader. He called on the authorities to save Ethiopia's Jews and bring them to Israel. It shows his great love for others.\\"'Thanks to him I'm here': How Rabbi Yosef brought Ethiopians to Israel Ilana Curiel, Published:10.08.13, Ynet  Attitude to Zionism  Yosef held a Halakhically ambivalent view towards Zionism as the Atchalta D'Geulah (beginning of the redemption). Many Religious Zionists, in contrast, view Israel as the first flowering of the redemption. In a Halakhic ruling regarding Israeli Independence Day, Yosef acknowledged that the Jewish people experienced a miracle with the establishment of the State of Israel; however, since the miracle did not include all of the Jewish people, Yosef's position could be seen as a middle ground between the Religious Zionists, for whom saying Hallel is compulsory, and the Ashkenazi Haredim, who do not say Hallel at all. In a newspaper interview in which Shas was accused of being anti- Zionist, Yosef responded: In 2010, Yosef and Shas' Moetzet Chachamei HaTorah (Council of [Wise] Torah Sages) approved Shas' membership in the World Zionist Organisation, making Shas the first officially Zionist Haredi party in Israel.  Yeshiva students and military service  Yosef regarded the wars fought by the State of Israel as falling within the Halakhic classification of Milkhemet Mitzvah. Nevertheless, he encouraged young students to remain in the Yeshivas, rather than be drafted into the military, because, \\"despite the sensitivity which Rabbi Yosef feels towards the Israel Defense Forces, he is deeply rooted in the Rabbinic tradition of the Yeshivas in the Land of Israel, and holds their position which opposes the integration of Yeshiva students in the military\\". Rabbi Binyamin Lau makes a cautious distinction between Yosef's public rhetoric, which presents a unified front with the Ashkenazi Haredim, and between internal discussions, where Yosef was said to be more receptive to solving the problem of integrating the Haredim into the military. Yosef's grandson points out his grandfather's positive attitude towards the IDF, in that whenever the Torah Ark is opened, Yosef blesses \\"mi sheberech\\" for IDF soldiers. Yosef's son, Rabbi Avraham Yosef, served in the IDF as a military Rabbi for 13 years.  Secular Israelis  Yosef frequently referred to the present situation in Israeli and Jewish society as \\"the generation of freedom and liberty\\". By this, Yosef referred to a modern reality of a Jewish community which is generally not committed to the Halakha, and where Rabbinic authority has lost its centrality. In this context, Yosef drew a distinction between those who profess a secular ideology, and those who are non-observant merely in the sense of a weak or incomplete commitment to Halakha accompanied by a strong belief in God and the Torah: This latter kind of non-observant Jews are, in Israel, mainly Mizrahi Jews who practice aspects of Judaism as a tradition (known as Masortiyim, not to be confused with Conservative Judaism, which is sometimes called Masorti Judaism). Yosef sought to bring this demographic closer to the Torah, while relying upon traditional Jewish sources for his rulings. For example, he ruled that those who desecrate the Sabbath are not to be considered as having abandoned the Torah, and therefore if they have touched wine, it remains Kosher. This sort of ruling differs from Ashkenazi Haredi rulings. Yosef actively aims to engage in Kiruv, while still strictly adhering to Halacha. Yosef, however, had no sympathy towards Israeli Jews who profess a secular lifestyle, and saw them as effectively being non- Jewish. His opinion was to fully exclude them from the Jewish community. For Yosef, the secularist Israeli public are secular out of 'spitefulness' towards Torah, and he likened them to idolatrous apostates.\\"Freedom Liberty and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef\\" by Ariel Picard, Havruta, Issue 2, Fall 2008, page 65-66  Israeli legal system  Yosef was opposed to bringing civil actions in the Israeli courts, because they decide outcomes by applying Israeli law, rather than Halakha. His opposition is consistent with the position of the Ashkenazi Haredi Rabbis, and some Religious Zionist Rabbis (e. g., Yaakov Ariel) as well. On this matter, Yosef has written: In matters of criminal law, however, Yosef is among the moderate Rabbinic voices who support the application of the rule dina d'malchuta dina ('the law of the land is the law'), and therefore, it is forbidden to engage in criminal conduct such as tax fraud. It is only in civil matters that he forbade going to the Israeli courts. In February 1999, Yosef caused a controversy by strongly criticizing the Supreme Court of Israel: Following these statements, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel, demanding that Yosef be put on trial. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, saying that the comments were within Yosef's right to freedom of speech. Nevertheless, then-Supreme Court President Aharon Barak wrote in his judgement:  Political activity   Government influence  Ovadia Yosef in 2007 In 1990, Yosef used his position as Shas spiritual leader to pressure Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir into agreeing to hold negotiations with Arab states for a peaceful settlement of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Shamir, a member of the Likud Party, refused to make any commitments. According to one biography of the rabbi, Ben Porat Yosef, the relationship between the two had never been comfortable because of Shamir's unstudious personality. As a way of gaining a character analysis of politicians, Yosef had invited both Shamir and Shimon Peres to learn Talmud with him. While Peres proved an engaging and fluid learner, Shamir was stoic toward the material, a trait that led Yosef to instead use one of Shamir's cabinet members, Housing and Construction Minister David Levy, as his key partner in dealing with the Likud. Levy had a relatively warm relationship with the rabbi due to his moderate approach to Israel's security and foreign affairs policies, his charismatic personality, and his connection with Sephardi traditions (Levy, a Moroccan, was the highest ranking Sephardi politician in the 1980s). In 1990, Rav Yosef pulled Shas out of the coalition with the Likud and attempted to form a partnership with Peres's left-centre Labour Party. The bold move, engineered but opposed by Shas chairman Aryeh Deri, backfired when the highly respected Ashkenazi rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Rabbi Elazar Shach (who subsequently founded the Degel HaTorah party) fiercely commanded Yosef to return Shas to the coalition with the Likud. During this time, Yosef was severely criticised by other major members of the Haredi religious community in Israel, particular the Ashkenazic Jews who generally sided with the Likud and the right in opposition to the perceived secularist tendencies of Labour and the left. The failure of the scheme, known as the stinking trick, was responsible for Peres' downfall as leader of Labour, and his 1991 defeat in internal elections to former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. From the 1980s until his death, Yosef approved the participation by Shas in most Israeli governments, except for the last two governments of Ariel Sharon from January 2003 and August 2005. In that Knesset (2003-2006), Shas was one of the few parties to have been in the opposition for the duration of that Knesset's term, along with the leftist Meretz party and the Arab factions Ra'am (United Arab List), Hadash, and Balad. This was largely because of the rise of Shinui to the powerful third party position, a position that was previously held by Shas. Shinui demanded the creation of a government without Shas. In the 2007 Israeli Presidential election, Yosef endorsed his long-time friend Shimon Peres, who ultimately won the election due in part to the support of Shas's 12 MKs.  Cultural influence  In a 2004 article by Maariv, Yosef was listed as one of the most influential rabbis in Israel. He was described as:  Position on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict  Despite his controversial public comments, Yosef had long been a rabbinical authority advocating peace negotiations in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and had done so since the late 1980s. His main justification was the halakhic principle of Pikuach Nefesh, in which all the Jewish commandments (excluding adultery, idolatry, and murder) are put on hold if a life is put in danger. Using an argument first articulated by the late American rabbinical leader Joseph Soloveitchik, Yosef claimed that the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict endangers human lives, thereby meeting the above criteria and overruling the priority of commandments pertaining to settling the land of Israel. Therefore, Israel is permitted‚Äîeven obligated if saving lives is a definitive outcome‚Äîto make serious efforts to reach a peace settlement, as well as to make arrangements to properly protect its citizens.Rav Ovadia Yossef. \\"Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives\\", Tehumim Vol. 10, 1989Rav Ovadia Yossef. \\"Ceding Territory of the Land of Israel in Order to Save Lives\\", Crossroads: Halacha and the Modern World Vol. 3, 1990 Yosef first applied the Pikuach Nefesh principle to Israel's conflicts with its neighbors in 1979, when he ruled that this argument granted Israel authority to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. Some claimed, however, that the ruling was also motivated by Yosef's desire to oppose his Ashkenazi colleague, Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Using this precedent, Yosef instructed Shas to join Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government coalition, and later that of Ehud Barak as well. However, Shas abstained on Oslo I and voted against the Oslo II agreement. Furthermore, as Oslo stalled, and relations between Israelis and Palestinians began to deteriorate, and particularly following the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Yosef and the party pulled \\"rightward\\", supporting the Likud. In 2005, Yosef repeatedly condemned the Gaza Disengagement. He argued that he was opposed to any unilateral action that occurred outside the framework of a peace agreement. Yosef again cited the principle of Pikuach Nefesh, saying that empowering the Palestinians without a commitment to end terror would result in threatening Jewish lives, particularly in areas near Gaza in range of Qassam rocket attacks.Engaging Disengagement- Knesset Faction Positions on the Disengagement by the Jewish Agency In contrast to some of his rabbinical colleagues, such as Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Yosef refused to entertain the idea of holding a referendum on the disengagement, and instructed his MKs to vote against the plan when it came up in the Knesset. Yosef always maintained that Pikuach Nefesh applies to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and supported negotiations with the Palestinians. However, toward the end of his life, he no longer appeared totally convinced that diplomacy with the PA leadership would necessarily end the violence. Some media analysts had suggested that then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert may have been able to convince the rabbi to sign on to further unilateral actions by the government if concerted efforts toward negotiation failed. Yosef protested strongly against demands by the United States and other foreign countries that Israel freeze construction in East Jerusalem, saying that, \\"It's as if we are their slaves\\". However, toward the end of his life, he indicated some flexibility on the issue, and may have taken a more pragmatic approach. In the wake of the diplomatic row between Israel and the US over Jewish housing in east Jerusalem, Yosef is reported to have said, in a private meeting with Shimon Peres, that \\"it is not permissible to challenge the nations of the world or the ruling powers\\", and that Israel should agree to a partial building freeze in east Jerusalem, at least temporarily.  Halakhic rulings  Yosef is generally considered one of the leading halakhic authorities, particularly for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, who bestowed upon him the honorific title of \\"Maran\\". Some of his more famous legal rulings include: * In 1973, as Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel, he ruled, based on the Radbaz and other opinions, that the Ethiopian Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel. He was later joined by a number of other authorities who made similar rulings, including the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Other notable poskim, from non-Zionist Ashkenazi circles, placed a halakhic safek (doubt) over the Jewishness of the Beta Israel. Such dissenting voices include Rabbis Elazar Shach, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, and Moshe Feinstein.Michael Ashkenazi, Alex Weingrod. Ethiopian Jews and Israel, Transaction Publishers, 1987, p. 30, footnote 4. * That it is legitimate and permissible to give territory from the Land of Israel in order to achieve a genuine peace. When the Oslo Accords were followed by an intifada, this opinion was later retracted.Settlement Timeline , Foundation for Middle East Peace * Supported the sale of the land during the Sabbatical year, following the Sephardic tradition. * Ordered the Shas political party to vote in favour of a law recognizing brain death as death for legal purposes. The Ashkenazi Haredi political party United Torah Judaism voted against the law on instructions from their spiritual leader Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. * Allowing the wives of Israel Defense Forces soldiers who have been missing in action for a long time to remarry, a verdict which is known as \\"the release of agunot\\" (◊î◊™◊®◊™ ◊¢◊í◊ï◊†◊ï◊™). * That a woman should not wear a wig (sheitel) as a form of hair covering, but should wear headscarves (or snoods / hats / berets) instead. (According to Jewish Law, married women must cover their hair in public for reasons of modesty. Some Ashkenazi Haredi women have the practice of wearing sheitels for this purpose.)  Controversial statements  Yosef has made a large number of statements that some have regarded as controversial. This has occurred in all aspects of his public life, including his politics, halakhic rulings, and other areas. Some notable instances are described below.  Holocaust victims  In 2000, he described the Holocaust as God's retribution against the reincarnated soul of Jewish sinners: Shas chairman Eli Yishai said criticism of the rabbi is unjustified, explaining, \\"Rabbi Ovadia weeps for every Jew who is killed...but nobody, not even a saint, has not sinned. Everyone dies in a state of sin.\\" It's even stated that he declared that Hitler was a messenger sent to do God's work before the arrival of the Messiah. In 2009, Yosef repeated his claims that the Holocaust was retribution for re-incarnated sinners:  Israeli soldiers killed in battle  In 2007, Yosef created controversy, stating of Israeli soldiers killed in battle: In a clarification, his secretary said that Rabbi Yosef was not stating an opinion of his own, and the remark, taken out of context, was a quote of a Talmudical source that was part of his lecture. Nevertheless, Meretz chairman Yossi Beilin responded that, \\"Instead of spewing drivel and hurting the bereaved families, the rabbi should call on yeshiva students to enlist in the army\\".  Statements in relation to the recommendations of the Plesner Committee  In 2013, Yosef called for yeshiva students to emigrate from Israel rather than agree to serve in the army, stating: In October 2013, immediately following Ovadia Yosef's death, his son, David Yosef stated to the Prime Minister that the drafting of Haredi students into the army had hurt him in his final months more than his physical illnesses.Yosef's son to Netanyhau: Haredi draft hurt dad more than his ailments By YUVAL BAGNO, JPOST.COM STAFF, The Jerusalem Post, 10/08/2013  Woman's role  In 2007, Yosef said: Yosef's comments were criticized by MK Colette Avital, who said they \\"show contempt and lower the value of women. In our tradition, there exist many examples of prophetesses who contributed to the continuity of the Jewish nation.\\" In 2011, Yosef said on the subject of women as soldiers:  Hurricane Katrina  Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Yosef blamed the tragedy on U.S. support for the Gaza disengagement, and on a general lack of Torah study in the area where the hurricane occurred: Part of the controversy surrounding Yosef's comments was his use of the Hebrew word \\"Kushim\\" to refer to the black people of New Orleans which in biblical Hebrew refers to an ancient African people, and in contemporary Hebrew, it may be used derogatorily.  Non-Jews' role  In an October 2010 sermon, Yosef stated that \\"The sole purpose of non-Jews is to serve Jews\\". He said that Gentiles served a divine purpose: In the same article in The Jerusalem Post, according to the journalist who interviewed him, Yosef compared Gentiles to donkeys whose life has the sole purpose to serve the master: The American Jewish Committee condemned Yosef's remarks, stating that The remark was also condemned by the Anti-Defamation League.  Statements against Avigdor Lieberman  In 2009, Yosef said about the Yisrael Beitenu party and its leader,  Arabs and Palestinians  In 2001, Yosef was quoted as saying of the Arabs: Yosef later said that his sermon was misquoted, that he was referring to annihilation of Islamic terrorism, and not of all Arabs. He called for improving the living conditions of the Arab people in Israel, and said that he has deep respect for peace-seeking Arabs. Israeli Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit condemned the sermon, saying: \\"A person of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's stature must refrain from acrid remarks such as these... I suggest that we not learn from the ways of the Palestinians and speak in verbal blows like these.\\" Yosef drew criticism from the US State Department in August 2010 following a Saturday morning sermon in which he called for Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Yosef's statements were tantamount to a call for genocide against Palestinians, and demanded a firm response from the Israeli government. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu distanced himself and his government from the sermon, stating that Yosef's words \\"do not reflect my approach, or the stand of the Israeli government\\". The rabbi said he regretted his statements, and was said to have looked for a way of sending a conciliatory message to the Palestinians. Three weeks later, Yosef sent out a conciliatory message reiterating his old positions in support of the peace process. He wished the Palestinians and their leaders,  Published works  Among Yosef's earliest works was a detailed commentary on the Ben Ish Hai titled Halikhot Olam. He was asked to finish the commentary Kaf Ha'Chaim by Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Sofer after the author's death. Two sets of Yosef's responsa have been published, Yabia Omer and Yechaveh Da'at (both titles are references to Psalm 19). His responsa are noted for citing almost every source regarding a specific topic and are often referred to simply as indices of rulings. There is also another series of books under the title of Hazon Ovadia (not to be mistaken with the original books, which were responsa on Passover), which he has written concerning laws of Shabbat, holidays, and other topics. Yosef printed a commentary on the Mishnah tractate Pirkei Avot (\\"Ethics of the Fathers\\") under the title Anaf Etz Avot, and Maor Israel, a commentary on various parts of the Talmud. His son, Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, has published a widely read codification of Yosef's rulings entitled Yalkut Yosef. Another son, Rabbi David Yosef, has printed various siddurim and liturgy according to his father's rulings, and another halachic compendium entitled Halachah Berurah. In 1970, Yosef was awarded the Israel Prize for Rabbinical literature.

Born in Western Australia, Farmer joined the East Perth Football Club as a ruckman in 1953, where he won several awards and contributed to the team winning three premierships. In 1962, he was recruited to the Victorian Football League (VFL), which would become the Australian Football League (AFL) almost three decades later. Farmer played 101 games for the Geelong Football Club and also captained the team for three seasons. He returned to Western Australia in 1968 and became the captain/coach of the West Perth Football Club, leading the club to premierships against East Perth in 1969 and 1971. After retiring as a player, he coached Geelong and East Perth, and Western Australia's first state of origin team. Farmer was made an official Legend of Australian rules football and is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players. The Graham Farmer Freeway in his hometown of Perth is named in his honour. Farmer was also the patron of the educational, not-for-profit Graham (Polly) Farmer Foundation, founded in 1995. Early life Farmer was born in Hillcrest Hospital, North Fremantle. He is considered a member of the Stolen Generation because, when he was only 18 months old, he was taken from his Noongar mother and put in Sister Kate's orphanage in Queens Park, Western Australia, a home for \\"half-caste\\" children. \\"I was the son of an unmarried part-Aboriginal. And I don't know the reasons why I was put in there\\". Farmer said, \\"If it had not been for Sister Kate's, I would have had an ice block's hope in hell of ever leading a normal life. I owe her and all her dedicated helpers everything ‚Äì for giving me the chance to make something of myself. I was one of the lucky ones.\\" A bout of poliomyelitis left Farmer with his left leg shorter than his right leg. According to Farmer, he was nicknamed \\"Polly the Parrot\\" as a six-year-old because people thought he chattered away like a parrot. At high school, Farmer was spotted by talent scouts for the East Perth Football Club and joined the team. Football career Farmer in October 1966 as captain of Geelong, shaking hands with government minister and former cycling champion Hubert Opperman as his teammates look on Farmer began his top-level career in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), known then as the West Australian National Football League (WANFL), with the East Perth Football Club in 1953. He played 176 games from 1953 to 1961 with East Perth. During this time he won the club's fairest and best award seven times and was a member of their 1956, 1958 and 1959 premiership teams. In 1956, he was awarded a Simpson Medal for his performance against South Australia at the Perth Carnival and later was also awarded the Tassie Medal for being judged best at the carnival overall. He was awarded the WANFL's highest individual honour, the Sandover Medal, in 1956 and 1960. He also tied for the medal in 1957 with East Fremantle's Jack Clarke but lost on a countback; he was awarded that medal in 1997 when the WAFL awarded retrospective medals for those who missed out on countbacks. In 1959, he was awarded the Simpson Medal for being best on ground in the grand final. He was awarded another Simpson Medal in 1961 for his game against Victoria at the Brisbane Carnival.https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-08-14/vale- polly-farmer-footy-mourns-one-of-its-original-legends Farmer attracted interest from Victorian clubs; at the end of 1955 he was signed by the Richmond Football Club for ¬£200, but (as was not uncommon at the time), he never made the move, remaining in Perth for the next six years. He was later recruited by Bob Davis to the Geelong Football Club in 1962. In the opening moments of his debut for Geelong in 1962, Farmer severely injured a knee, causing ligament damage and missed the rest of the season. He returned in 1963, winning a premiership with Geelong and coming equal-second in the Brownlow Medal behind Bob Skilton. Farmer played 101 games for Geelong from 1962 to 1968, won the team's fairest and best award in 1963 and 1964 and captained the team from 1965 until 1967. For 1968, Farmer desired to return home to Western Australia. Although he had trained briefly with East Perth during 1967 as part of a testimonial to retired Royal teammate \\"Square\\" Kilmurray,\\"Farmer Arrives\\", The West Australian, 29 May 1967, p. 19. Farmer accepted the role of captain/coach with the West Perth Football Club, rivals to his former club, East Perth. He led West Perth to premierships in 1969 and 1971, both times defeating East Perth in the grand final. In 1969, Farmer received his fourth Simpson Medal during the AFC Championships in Adelaide. He retired from playing football in 1971, aged 36, after 69 games with West Perth.http://www.westperthfc.com.au/news/12015/round-2-preview-v-east-perth Not involved in top level football in 1972, Farmer returned to the VFL as coach of the Geelong Football Club from 1973 to 1975. Farmer and the club's committee had an increasingly strained relationship and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, \\"When the going gets tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. I do my best in football and I have no time to protect my back, so it's left wide open. Maybe that's a lot of my trouble.\\" During his career, Farmer played a record 31 games for Western Australia, five games for Victoria and was selected in the All-Australian team in 1956, 1958 and 1961. He played in 356 league games overall, including 30 finals, 10 grand finals and six premierships. Farmer was a strong, skilled and mobile ruckman. At tall and weighing , Farmer had a naturally high leap that helped him to win ruck contests easily. Farmer practised handballing through car windows at the car yard where he worked and one of his football legacies is changing handballing from a last-resort option to a \\"dangerous offensive weapon\\". According to Geelong player Sam Newman, \\"without speaking one word he [Farmer] taught me everything I know. I watched how a man overcomes not the physical, not the mental, but the spiritual ‚Äì that's the most important ‚Äì he was an absolute star, about one decade, one century ahead of his time\\". Personal life and death In 1956, Farmer met Marlene, a Tasmanian woman holidaying in Perth. They married in 1957 and had three children, Brett, Dean and Kim. In the 1960s, former Geelong player Neil Trezise approached Farmer about representing the Australian Labor Party in the seat of Corio. Farmer declined. Farmer established the Polly Farmer Foundation, joined by Sir Ronald Wilson, a former High Court judge; Fred Chaney, a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs; and Greg Durham, chief executive of the Geelong Football Club. One of the Foundation's patrons is Ernie Dingo. Farmer explained, \\"I want the foundation to be of practical assistance to young Aboriginal people with potential to do something with their lives ‚Ä¶ Not just sport, but in the professions and business. We want to develop links with the tertiary institutions and make sure Aboriginal people become leaders.\\" Farmer and his wife Marlene sold their house in 1992 and ran a two-star Southway Auto Lodge motel in South Perth until 1998. Farmer said the business failed due to the downturn in the Asian economy and a 40% drop in tourist numbers. It left him with no money or assets. He said, \\"We have nothing and we are back to square one. But we didn't borrow money to keep the business going. All my life I have helped myself and there is no reason why I can't still do that.\\" Farmer and Marlene were given temporary accommodation at the caretaker's flat in the Main Roads building. Two fundraising events were organised in Perth and Melbourne by John Watts, Bob Davis and Sam Newman, raising $120,000. A trust fund was established with the money and a small villa was bought in Innaloo. In 1999, Farmer was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He died at Fiona Stanley Hospital, Murdoch, on 14 August 2019, aged 84. He was given a state funeral, held at Perth Stadium, on 26 August. After his death, Farmer's brain was donated to the Australian Sports Brain Bank. A study of his brain by researchers at the bank identified chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Farmer is the first former VFL/AFL player to be diagnosed with the condition. Legacy St Georges Terrace bronze tablet In 1971, he became the first Australian footballer to receive a Queen's honour when he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the New Year honours list. Farmer's name was included in the 150 bronze tablets set into the footpath along St Georges Terrace that commemorate notable figures in Western Australia's history, as part of the WAY 1979 celebrations. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. On 6 October 1997, Western Australian Transport Minister Eric Charlton announced that the $400 m Northern City Bypass would be named the Graham Farmer Freeway. Charlton said, \\"He already has a place in WA sporting folklore and it is fitting that a showpiece of the city's transport network should bear his name‚Ä¶ The northern traffic bypass system links West Perth and East Perth which are, coincidentally, the two districts which Graham Farmer represented with distinction on the football arena\\". He was inducted into the inaugural Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the twelve official \\"Legends\\" and then into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2004. He has been nominated as the first ruckman in every Team of the Century for each of the two leagues and three clubs for which he participated, plus the Indigenous Team of the Century, in which he was the captain. In 2008, Farmer was named at number 5 in The Ages top football players of all time. Farmer is depicted contesting a boundary throw- in with Carlton ruckman John Nicholls (the other ruckman in the AFL Team of the Century) in Jamie Cooper's painting the Game That Made Australia, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.Australian Football League, The Game That Made Australia , Retrieved 19 September 2010 Farmer is also depicted in the rare 1963 Scanlens football card series, which due to production problems during the printing process, is now considered one of the rarest and most valuable trading cards in Australia.

It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a tensor product of copies of it. Symbolic notation The symbolic method uses a compact, but rather confusing and mysterious notation for invariants, depending on the introduction of new symbols a, b, c, ... (from which the symbolic method gets its name) with apparently contradictory properties. Example: the discriminant of a binary quadratic form These symbols can be explained by the following example from . Suppose that :\\\\displaystyle f(x) = A_0x_1^2+2A_1x_1x_2+A_2x_2^2 is a binary quadratic form with an invariant given by the discriminant :\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta=A_0A_2-A_1^2. The symbolic representation of the discriminant is :\\\\displaystyle 2\\\\Delta=(ab)^2 where a and b are the symbols. The meaning of the expression (ab)2 is as follows. First of all, (ab) is a shorthand form for the determinant of a matrix whose rows are a1, a2 and b1, b2, so :\\\\displaystyle (ab)=a_1b_2-a_2b_1. Squaring this we get :\\\\displaystyle (ab)^2=a_1^2b_2^2-2a_1a_2b_1b_2+a_2^2b_1^2. Next we pretend that :\\\\displaystyle f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^2=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^2 so that :\\\\displaystyle A_i=a_1^{2-i}a_2^{i}= b_1^{2-i}b_2^{i} and we ignore the fact that this does not seem to make sense if f is not a power of a linear form. Substituting these values gives :\\\\displaystyle (ab)^2= A_2A_0-2A_1A_1+A_0A_2 = 2\\\\Delta. Higher degrees More generally if :\\\\displaystyle f(x) = A_0x_1^n+\\\\binom{n}{1}A_1x_1^{n-1}x_2+\\\\cdots+A_nx_2^n is a binary form of higher degree, then one introduces new variables a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, with the properties :f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2)^n=\\\\cdots. What this means is that the following two vector spaces are naturally isomorphic: *The vector space of homogeneous polynomials in A0,...An of degree m *The vector space of polynomials in 2m variables a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, ... that have degree n in each of the m pairs of variables (a1, a2), (b1, b2), (c1, c2), ... and are symmetric under permutations of the m symbols a, b, ...., The isomorphism is given by mapping a'a, b'b, .... to Aj. This mapping does not preserve products of polynomials. More variables The extension to a form f in more than two variables x1, x2,x3,... is similar: one introduces symbols a1, a2,a3 and so on with the properties :f(x)=(a_1x_1+a_2x_2+a_3x_3+\\\\cdots)^n=(b_1x_1+b_2x_2+b_3x_3+\\\\cdots)^n=(c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_3x_3+\\\\cdots)^n=\\\\cdots. Symmetric products The rather mysterious formalism of the symbolic method corresponds to embedding a symmetric product Sn(V) of a vector space V into a tensor product of n copies of V, as the elements preserved by the action of the symmetric group. In fact this is done twice, because the invariants of degree n of a quantic of degree m are the invariant elements of SnSm(V), which gets embedded into a tensor product of mn copies of V, as the elements invariant under a wreath product of the two symmetric groups. The brackets of the symbolic method are really invariant linear forms on this tensor product, which give invariants of SnSm(V) by restriction.

For information on the philosophical and scientific meanings, see materialism. Materialism is a personal attitude which attaches importance to acquiring and consuming material goods. The use of the term materialistic tends to describe a person's personality or a society tends to have a negative or critical connotation. Also called acquisitiveness, it is often associated with a value system which regards social status as being determined by affluence (see conspicuous consumption), as well as the belief that possessions can provide happiness. Environmentalism can be considered a competing orientation to materialism. Materialism can be considered a pragmatic form of enlightened self-interest based on a prudent understanding of the character of market- oriented economy and society. Definition Consumer research typically looks at materialism in two ways: one as a collection of personality traits; and the other as an enduring belief or value.  Materialism as a personality trait  Russell W. Belk conceptualizes materialism to include three original personality traits. * Nongenerosity ‚Äì an unwillingness to give or share possession with others. * Envy ‚Äì desire for other people's possessions. * Possessiveness ‚Äì concern about loss of possessions and a desire for the greater control of ownership.  Materialism as a value  Acquisition centrality is when acquiring material possession functions as a central life goal with the belief that possessions are the key to happiness and that success can be judged by a person's material wealth and the quality and price of material goods she or he can buy. Growing materialism in the western world In the western world, there is a growing trend of increasing materialism in reaction to discontent. Research conducted in the United States shows that recent generations are focusing more on money, image, and fame than ever before, especially since the generations of Baby Boomers and Generation X. In one survey of Americans, over 7% said they would seriously murder someone for $3 million and 65% of respondents said they would spend a year on a deserted island to earn $1 million. A survey conducted by the University of California and the American Council on Education on 250,000 new college students found that their main reason for attending college was to gain material wealth. From the 1970s to the late 1990s, the percentage of students who stated that their main reason for going to college was to develop a meaningful life philosophy dropped from more than 80% to about 40%, while the purpose of obtaining financial gain rose from about 40% to more than 75%. Materialism and happiness A series of studies have observed a correlation between materialism and unhappiness. Studies in the United States have found that an increase in material wealth and goods in the country has had little to no effect on the well-being and happiness of its citizens. Tibor Scitovsky called this a \\"joyless economy\\" in which people endlessly pursue comforts to the detriments of pleasures. Using two measures of subjective well-being, one study found that materialism was negatively related to happiness, meaning that people who tended to be more materialistic were also less happy with themselves and their lives. When people derive a lot of pleasure from buying things and believe that acquiring material possessions are important life goals, they tend to have lower life satisfaction scores. Materialism also positively correlates with more serious psychological issues like depression, narcissism and paranoia. However, the relationship between materialism and happiness is more complex. The direction of the relationship can go both ways. Individual materialism can cause diminished well-being or lower levels of well-being can cause people to be more materialistic in an effort to get external gratification. Instead, research shows that purchases made with the intention of acquiring life experiences such as going on a family vacation make people happier than purchases made to acquire material possessions such as an expensive car. Even just thinking about experiential purchases makes people happier than thinking about material ones.

Commercial rice milk is typically manufactured using brown rice and brown rice syrup, and may be sweetened using sugar or sugar substitutes, and flavored by common ingredients, such as vanilla. It is commonly fortified with protein and micronutrients, such as vitamin B12, calcium, iron, or vitamin D. Nutrition Rice milk (unsweetened) is 89% water, 9% carbohydrates, 1% fat, and contains negligible protein (table). A 100 ml reference amount provides 47 calories, and - if purposely fortified during manufacturing - 26% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin B12 (table).

Commercial brands of rice milk are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, including calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin B3, and iron. It has a glycemic index of 86 compared to 37 for skim milk and 39 for whole milk. Rice milk is the least allergenic among plant milks, and may be consumed by people who are lactose intolerant, allergic to soy or milk. It is also used as a dairy substitute by vegans. Commercial brands Commercial brands of rice milk are available in various flavors, such as vanilla, as well as unflavored, and can be used in many recipes as an alternative to traditional cow milk. Preparation Rice milk is made commercially by pressing the rice through a grinding mill, followed by filtration and blending in water. It may be made at home using rice flour and brown rice protein, or by boiling brown rice with a large volume of water, blending and filtering the mixture. Environmental concerns Rice paddies require substantial water resources, and may enable fertilizers and pesticides to migrate into contiguous waterways. Bacteria inhabiting rice paddies release methane into the atmosphere, emitting this greenhouse gas in quantities greater than other plant milks. Rice milk production uses less water than dairy milk and almond milk, but considerably more than soy milk or oat milk.

Southwick Beach State Park is a New York State park that lies along an unusual stretch of sandy beach on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario. The park is in size with a length of beach, and is visited annually by about 100,000 people. Immediately to the south is the Lakeview Wildlife Management Area (), which extends the publicly accessible beach by several miles. They are in the Town of Ellisburg in Jefferson County, New York south of the lakeside community of Jefferson Park. The park offers an extensive campground with tent and trailer sites, picnic facilities, playing fields and a playground. In summer, the swimming area has lifeguards and the park store is open. In winter, snowmobiles are permitted in the park. The park has an accessible nature trail. There are hiking trails from the park that extend into the Lakeview Wildlife Management Area. Lakeview itself has several access points for launching boats, as well as a second nature trail along South Sandy Creek. The hiking trails and boat routes are described at several websites, and in guidebooks by William P. Ehling and by Susan Peterson Gateley.Ehling, William P. (1995). Fifty Hikes in Central New York: Hikes and Backpacking Trips from the Western Adirondacks to the Finger Lakes (Countryman Press). . The park and wildlife management area lie within a rare, freshwater coastal barrier environment that consists of beaches, sand dunes, embayments and marshes. The wildlife management area is also the Lakeview Marsh and Barrier Beach National Natural Landmark, which was cited in 1973 as, \\"One of the best and most extensive marshlands that lie in protected bays and behind barrier beaches along eastern Lake Ontario.\\" Southwick Beach State Park and Lakeview Wildlife Management Area are included within the New York State Natural Heritage Area entitled \\"Eastern Lake Ontario Barrier Beach and Wetland Complex\\"; Lakeview is incorporated in the Eastern Lake Ontario Marshes Bird Conservation Area. Beachgrass & the dunes The dunes immediately adjacent to the beach support a plant community dominated by beachgrass. The beachgrass grows runners under the surface of the sand that interlock into a ropelike network, and actually builds the dune by trapping sand. Some tall wormwood plants grow amidst the beachgrass, as do cottonwood trees and sand dune willows. Cottonwood is the only dune-forming tree in the area. Sand dune willows are fairly rare in New York State, but are a common woody plant in these dunes. This \\"beachgrass plant community\\" stabilizes the dunes against erosion by wind and storm, and enables the growth of a more complex, \\"poison ivy-dune grape-cottonwood plant community\\" deeper in the dunes. Beachgrass growth is disrupted by human and animal traffic. In heavily used regions of the eastern Lake Ontario dunes, foot traffic has eliminated this plant community entirely. Without the beachgrass, the sand dunes are blown away by wind. Starting in the early 1990s, there has been extensive restoration of the beachgrass along eastern Lake Ontario. Wooden \\"walkovers\\" have been constructed to manage traffic across the dunes between the beach and interior trails and waterways. The restoration has been accompanied by education and outreach programs intended to reduce traffic across the dunes. The improvement in beachgrass growth has been documented by a \\"photomonitoring project\\" from 1995-2005. Until the 20th Century, the beachgrass in this region would have been the type now known as \\"Champlain beachgrass\\", which is found only along eastern Lake Ontario and along Lake Champlain. It is very similar to the common American beachgrass native to the Atlantic coasts of North America, but blooms in July instead of September. \\"Cape variety\\" American beachgrass was introduced into the area, and is now mixed with Champlain. Boogie, baseball, and beaches: the Southwick history Southwick Beach State Park was named after the Southwick family, who owned the property for nearly a century (1870 to 1960); the park is referred to as \\"Southwick's Beach State Park\\" on some maps. Starting in the 1920s, several promoters built entertainment facilities on the property. The most notable was Albert Ellis, who leased the beach from the Southwick family for about 15 years, and developed it as the \\"Coney Island\\" of Northern New York. In time, the beach boasted a roller coaster, bathhouses, a dance pavilion, merry go-round, and midway. Ellis also organized the Jefferson County Amateur Baseball League. A baseball diamond was built at Southwick Beach, and for several years there was a Southwick Beach team. These businesses failed during the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1941). The \\"History\\" is printed in the booklet distributed to park visitors. No author, publication date, or primary sources are provided. By the 1950s, the value of the eastern Lake Ontario shoreline for recreation and conservation was becoming clear, although little of this land was publicly owned. In 1960, the Leesi Management Corporation of Syracuse purchased the beach property from the Southwick family and operated the beach as a recreational facility for five years. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation purchased the property in 1965 for $150,000; Southwick Beach State Park opened in May, 1966. Lagoons and sand: geology of eastern Lake Ontario The sandy beaches at the Park are part of a length of sandy shore between Sandy Pond to the south and Black Pond to the north. Another comparable stretch of sandy beach on Lake Ontario is at Sandbanks Provincial Park in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada, which is along the northeastern shore of the lake. These are the main areas with sandy beaches on Lake Ontario. Bradford B. van Diver has described the eastern Lake Ontario dunes as \\"similar in many details to the south shore of Long Island, with drowned river mouths forming lagoons behind a smooth curving line of barrier bars.\\" The lagoons to which van Diver refers are the notable ponds of this region, including (from north to south) Black, Lakeview, North Sandy, and South Sandy. Both the rivers themselves, and their mouths, are no longer evident. Shortly after the cessation of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago, the water level of Lake Ontario was much lower than it is today; one needs to envision large rivers flowing into a lake some tens of meters lower than today's level. The river mouths were then \\"drowned\\" by the rise of the water level of Lake Ontario above this low point. The work of Anderson and Lewis (1985) is the basis for these authors' views on the history of the postglacial water levels. Similarly, sand itself is no longer being formed in abundance; the sand present on today's beaches was probably formed long ago, and transported down from higher elevations during the post-glacial period of low water levels in the lake. These authors credit Sutton, Lewis, and Woodrow (1972) for the original hypothesis of transport of the sand from upland sites along the postglacial shoreline of Lake Iroquois to its present location.

It was written by Gray and Matt Reeves, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron and James Caan. The setting is the commuter rail yards in New York City, in the boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. In the film's plot, bribery, corporate crime and political corruption are commonplace in \\"the yards\\", where contractors repair railway cars for the city Transit Authority (TA). Rival companies sabotage each other's work to win bids. The undercutting leads to murder. Plot Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) rides the subway to his mother's house in Queens, New York, where she throws a surprise party in honor of his parole. His cousin Erica (Charlize Theron) is at the party with her boyfriend Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix). Willie takes Leo aside and thanks him for serving time in prison, implying that Leo had taken a fall for their gang of friends. Leo is eager to find a job to support his mother (Ellen Burstyn), who has a heart condition. Willie suggests working for Erica's stepfather Frank Olchin (James Caan). The next day, at the railway car repair company Frank owns, Leo is encouraged to enter a 2-year machinist program and Frank offers to help finance his studies. Needing to work right away, Leo asks about working with Willie for the company but Frank discourages that idea. Leo is advised by Willie not to worry about it, saying Frank tried to get him into a machinist program as well. At Brooklyn Borough Hall, Willie explains how corrupt the contract system is for repair work on the subway. After a hearing to award contracts, Willie is approached by Hector Gallardo (Robert Montano) about leaving Frank's firm for his. Willie brushes him off, taking Leo with him to Roosevelt Island, where he bribes an official in charge of awarding contracts. One night, Willie takes Leo to a rail yard, where he and a gang sabotage the work of Gallardo's firm in order to lower their quality rating and lessen their ability to get contracts. Leo is told to stand watch while the crew sabotages the train couplings. Willie heads into the yard master's office to pay him off with Knicks tickets, but is told to get his crew off the tracks, Gallardo having brought him $2,000 in cash. The yard master sounds the alarm, which draws a police officer. Terrified of returning to jail, Leo tries to run. When the cop begins to hit Leo with his night stick, Leo beats him into unconsciousness. As he runs off, he sees Willie kill the yard master. With the cop in a coma at a hospital, the crew tells Leo that he must murder the officer to prevent him from identifying Leo when he wakes up. If the cop lives, Leo's the one who will be killed. Leo flees. When the cop awakes, he identifies Leo as his attacker, triggering a broad manhunt. The police assume Leo is also responsible for the yard master's murder. When they raid his mother's apartment, she has a heart attack, leaving her in an even weaker state. Even though Willie has told him to lay low, Leo emerges from hiding to visit his sick mother. Erica is tending to her. She finds out Willie was with him at the yards and realizes it was Willie who actually killed the yard master. She breaks off their engagement. Erica implores Frank to help, but instead Leo realizes that Frank is prepared to kill him. Out of options, Leo turns to Gallardo for protection. With Gallardo's lawyers at his side, Leo turns himself in at a public hearing into the rail yard incident and contract corruption. Realizing that the injured cop's testimony against Leo is in no one's interest, Frank and Gallardo negotiate a new split of the contracts with the Queens Borough President (Steve Lawrence) in a backroom deal. Frank disowns Willie, who tries unsuccessfully to accept a deal offered to him earlier by Gallardo for protection, which Leo had already accepted. Willie goes to see Erica, trying to win her back. Frank has told him that Erica and Leo had been in love when they were younger, and once were caught having sex. Fearful of his temper and jealousy, Erica triggers the silent house alarm. Willie tries to embrace her, but as she pulls away, he accidentally throws Erica off the second floor landing, causing her to fall to her death. Outside the house, he surrenders to the police, who have responded to the alarm. Police enter the hearing to inform Erica's mother Kitty (Faye Dunaway) and Frank of the incident at the house, and the discovery of Erica's body. After Erica's funeral, Frank takes Leo aside to promise help in the future. Leo turns away in disgust and joins the grieving Kitty and the rest of the family in an embrace of support. Leo then leaves Queens on the elevated train. (Note: A non-director's cut of the film ended with Leo testifying against Frank and his company, rejecting the deal. The version currently available on the Miramax DVD in the US is the director's cut.) Cast Production The film was based on an actual corruption scandal in the mid-1980s involving the director (James Gray)'s father. MTA New York City Transit (the city's Metropolitan Transit Authority) first refused the production companies the right to film at any of its yards because it believed the film portrayed the agency in a bad light. The film was shot in Maspeth and Elmhurst, Queens, Roosevelt Island, the Bronx, and New Jersey. The railyard scenes were shot at the 207th Street shop on the New York City Transit system and at an abandoned freight yard in Brooklyn. It was shot in the spring and summer of 1998 but not released until the fall of 2000 due to studio delays. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64%, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 5.93/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Featuring strong performances and direction, The Yards is a richly textured crime thriller with an authentic feel.\\" Box office On a relatively limited release, the film, which had a $24 million budget, took in just $889,352 in the United States and Canada, and $34,684 in Australia.

The park is situated on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, east of Sodus Bay. From the park's hiking trails, visitors can view the large clay formations at the water's edge for which the park is named. Geology A portion of the Chimney Bluffs in 2014 The bluffs are formed from eroded drumlins, teardrop-shaped hills of glacial till that were deposited and shaped by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The erosive power of wind, rain, snow, and waves has formed the landscape into sharp pinnacles. Although the pinnacles and cliffs, some of which rise up to above the lake shore, have existed for thousands of years, they are constantly changing and further eroding. The average erosion of bluffs is per year. The Lake Ontario shoreline from Sodus Bay to Oswego has many bluffs, of which Chimney Bluffs is the most visited. Park history and features A 1907 postcard of Chimney Bluffs The Chimney Bluffs area has been a landmark for many years. According to the pamphlet given by the park, smugglers used the area as a landing point while transporting liquor from Canada during Prohibition. The area was acquired by the state of New York in 1963 after having previously been operated informally as a privately owned recreation area. It lay undeveloped until 1999 when a parking lot, service building with heated restrooms, picnic areas with grills, and hiking trails throughout the park were added. It is considered a year- round park for hiking and picnicking in the summer. Swimming is prohibited. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing; a trailhead for snowmobiling is also located within the park. Hiking Trails at Chimney Bluffs State Park The park has approximately of hiking trails, including a trail along the Bluffs between the west and east entrances. From some vantage points in the park, visitors can see Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station, to the northeast, as well as the coal smokestacks located in Oswego.

When the actors of the Moscow Arts Theatre were preparing the play for its first run in 1902, Maxim Gorky supplied them with photographs of the Nizhny Novgorod underclass taken by the famous local photographer, Maxim Dmitriev (–ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤), to help with the realism of the acting and costumes.\\"–ü—Ä–µ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É–µ–º—ã–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–º\\" (\\"He was chased by the theatre\\"), by –û–ª—å–≥–∞ –ù–∞—É–º–æ–≤–∞ (Olga Naumova). Peterburgsky Teatralny Zhurnal, No. 42, November 2005 When it first appeared, The Lower Depths was criticized for its pessimism and ambiguous ethical message. The presentation of the lower classes was viewed as overly dark and unredemptive, and Gorky was clearly more interested in creating memorable characters than in advancing a formal plot. However, in this respect, the play is generally regarded as a masterwork. The theme of harsh truth versus the comforting lie pervades the play from start to finish, as most of the characters choose to deceive themselves over the bleak reality of their condition.

Moscow Art Theatre, 1902 The cellar resembles a cave, with only one small window to illuminate its dank recesses. In a corner, thin boards partition off the room of Vaska, the young thief. In the kitchen live Kvashnya (Dough), a vendor of meat pies, the decrepit Baron, and the streetwalker Nastya. All around the room are bunks occupied by other lodgers. Nastya, her head bent down, is absorbed in reading a novel titled Fatal Love. The Baron, who lives largely on Nastya's earnings, seizes the book and reads its title aloud. Then he bangs Nastya over the head with it and calls her a lovesick fool. Satine raises himself painfully from his bunk at the noise. His memory is vague, but he knows he took a beating the night before, and the others tell him he had been caught cheating at cards. The Actor stirs in his bed on top of the stove. He predicts that some day Satine will be beaten to death. The Actor reminds the Baron to sweep the floor. The landlady is strict and makes them clean every day. The Baron loudly announces that he has to go shopping; he and Kvashnya leave to make the day's purchases. The Actor climbs down from his bunk and declares that the doctor has told him he has an organ poisoned by alcohol, and sweeping the floor would be bad for his health. Anna coughs loudly in her bunk. She is dying of consumption‚Äîthere is no hope for her. Her husband, Kleshtch (Tick), is busy at his bench, where he fits old keys and locks. Anna sits up and calls to Kleshtch, offering him the dumplings that Kvashnya has left for her in the pot. Kleshtch agrees that there is no use feeding a dying woman, and so with a clear conscience he eats the dumplings. The Actor helps Anna down from her high bed and out into the drafty hall. The sick woman is wrapped in rags. As they go through the door, the landlord, Kostilyoff, enters, nearly knocking them down. Kostilyoff looks around the dirty cellar and glances several times at Kleshtch, working at his bench. Loudly, the landlord says that the locksmith occupies too much room for two rubles a month and that henceforth the rent will be two and one-half rubles. Then Kostilyoff edges toward Vaska's room and inquires furtively if his wife has been in. Kostilyoff has good reason to suspect that his wife, Vassilisa, is sleeping with Vaska. At last, Kostilyoff gets up the courage to call out to Vaska. The thief comes out of his room and denounces the landlord for not paying his debts, saying that Kostilyoff still owes seven rubles for a watch he had bought. Ordering Kostilyoff to produce the money immediately, Vaska sends him roughly out of the room. The others admire Vaska for his courage and urge him to kill Kostilyoff and marry Vassilisa; then he could be landlord. Vaska thinks the idea over for a time but decides that he is too softhearted to be a landlord. Besides, he is thinking of discarding Vassilisa for her sister, Natasha. Satine asks Vaska for twenty kopecks, which the thief is glad to give; he is afraid Satine will want a ruble next. Natasha comes in with the tramp Luka. She puts him in the kitchen to sleep with the three already there. Luka, a merry fellow, begins to sing, but he stops when all the others object. The whole group sits silent when Vassilisa comes in, sees the dirty floor, and gives orders for an immediate sweeping. She looks over the new arrival, Luka, and asks to see his passport. Because he has none, he is more readily accepted by the others. Miedviedeff, who is a policeman and Vassilisa's uncle, enters the cellar to check up on the lodging. He begins to question Luka, but when the tramp calls him sergeant, Miedviedeff leaves him alone. That night, Anna lies in her bunk while a noisy, quarrelsome card game goes on. Luka talks gently to the consumptive woman, and Kleshtch comes from time to time to look at her. Luka remarks that her death will be hard on her husband, but Anna accuses Kleshtch of causing her death. She says that she looks forward to the rest and peace she has never known. Luka assures her she will be at peace after her death. The card players become louder and Satine is accused of cheating. Luka quiets the riotous players; they all respect him even though they think him a liar. He tells Vaska that he will be able to reform in Siberia, and he assures the Actor that at a sanatorium he could be cured of alcoholism. Vassilisa comes in, and when the others leave, she offers Vaska three hundred rubles if he will kill Kostilyoff and set her free. That would leave Vaska free to marry Natasha, who at the moment is recovering from a beating given to her by her jealous sister. Vaska is about to refuse when Kostilyoff enters in search of his wife. He is extremely suspicious, but Vaska pushes him out of the cellar. A noise on top of the stove reveals that Luka has overheard everything. He is not greatly disturbed and warns Vaska not to have anything to do with the vicious Vassilisa. Walking over to Anna's bunk, Luka sees that she is dead. They find Kleshtch at the saloon, and he comes to look at the body of his dead wife. The others tell him that he will have to remove the body, because in time dead people smell. Kleshtch agrees to take Anna's body outside. The Actor begins to cavort in joy, talking excitedly. He has made up his mind to go to the sanatorium for his health. Luka has told him that he can even be cured at state expense. In the backyard that night, as Natasha is telling romantic stories to the crowd, Kostilyoff comes out and gruffly orders her in to work. As she goes in, Vassilisa pours boiling water on Natasha's feet. Vaska attempts to rescue her and knocks Kostilyoff down, and in the ensuing brawl Kostilyoff is killed. As the others slink away, Vassilisa immediately accuses Vaska of murder. Natasha thinks that Vaska has murdered Kostilyoff for the sake of Vassilisa. Natasha is almost in delirium as she wanders about accusing Vaska of murder and calling for revenge. She says to always keep the odds out of even and not to trouble the trouble until trouble troubles someone. Sensing trouble, Luka disappears, and is never seen again. Vaska escapes a police search. Natasha is put to the hospital. The rest of the down-and-outers continue with their daily chores much like before. Satine cheats at cards, and the Baron tries to convince the others of his former affluence. They all agree that Luka was a kind old man but a great liar. During a bitter quarrel with Nastya, the Baron steps out in the yard. Satine and the others strike up a bawdy song, but they break off when the Baron bursts in with the news of Actor's suicide, to which Satine, quite without compassion, coldly retorts: \\"You spoiled the song, you idiot\\".

Farmer has an established reputation in international and national ultra-marathons. Between April 2011 and January 2012, Farmer successfully completed the world's longest ultra-marathon, a \\"Pole to Pole Run\\" from the North Pole to the South Pole, raising 100,000 for Red Cross International. Biography Farmer was born in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo, one of seven children to Mary and Frank Farmer and grew up in Sydney's western suburbs, starting his working life as a motor mechanic from 1977 to 1984 after attending Granville TAFE. From 1984 to 2000, Farmer commenced his passion of ultra-marathon running while working with his brother Tony as a landscape gardener and later as a motivational speaker. In 1992, he married Lisa Bullivant and they bought land in Catherine Field, where they began building their family home. They went on to have two children, Brooke and Dillon. In 1998, Lisa, aged 34, died unexpectedly of Mitral Valve Prolapse and Farmer was left to raise his two children on his own. During this period, Farmer set a number of ultra-marathon Australian and world records, which placed him in the elite of the sport. Before joining politics in 2001, he raised very significant funds for Diabetes Australia, Lifeline, Careflight International and the Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research. Farmer is perhaps best known for his record-breaking 14,964 km Centenary of Federation run around all of Australia in 1999, taking 191 days. These records were never ratified and are still held by Gary Parsons of Queensland. This event raised considerable funds for charity. He was named Achiever of the Year at the Australian of the Year Awards 2000, presented by Prime Minister John Howard. Political career Following his ultra-marathon, Farmer was approached by Howard in 2000 and encouraged Farmer to seek Liberal endorsement for the Sydney-area seat of Division of Macarthur. The seat had been reconfigured to be a notional Labor seat after losing nearly all of its rural territory, but Farmer retained it for the Liberals on a swing of seven percent, and actually won enough primary votes to take the seat without the need for preferences. He was returned in 2004 with an increased margin. During his time in Parliament, Farmer served on a range of House of Representatives committees including: Education and Training from 26 September 2002 to 31 August 2004; Communications, Information Technology and the Arts from 4 November 2003 to 31 August 2004. On 26 October 2004 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training (with special responsibility for Western Sydney). Farmer suffered a 10.43 percent swing against him at the 2007 federal election, in which the Howard Government lost to Kevin Rudd's Labor Party. Farmer retained his seat with a margin of 0.7 percent, becoming the first opposition MP in the seat's history. After the election he was appointed the Shadow Minister for Youth and Sport. In January 2008 he moved to Mosman on Sydney's harbourside against the advice of then Liberal Party leader Brendan Nelson, but stated that it would not affect his ability to represent his electorate in the city's western suburbs. On 22 September he was dropped from the shadow ministry by the newly elected opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull. In August 2009 Farmer was reported to be considering standing for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly after a redistribution erased his already tenuous margin in Macarthur, making it notionally Labor. In a Liberal Party preselection ballot for Macarthur, held on 30 October 2009, Farmer was defeated by Russell Matheson and retired from politics at the 2010 federal election. His stock was considerably weakened in 2007 when he moved to the North Shore suburb of Mosman, far outside his electorate.https://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/fed2016/macarthur/ On 2 February 2015, Farmer announced that he would be contesting the 2015 NSW State Election as the Liberal candidate in Macquarie Fields, which included a small slice of his old federal seat. He got a significant boost from a redistribution that made the Labor-held seat notionally Liberal. However, he was defeated on a nearly 10-point swing by Labor candidate Anoulack Chanthivong. Farmer unsuccessfully contested Maroubra as the Liberal candidate at the 2019 New South Wales state election. Pole to Pole Run In his valedictory speech to Parliament on 23 June 2010, Pat Farmer formally announced his long-held goal of running from the North Pole to the South Pole, covering some , to raise funds for clean water programs for Red Cross International. Farmer departed the North Pole on 8 April 2011 and finished at the South Pole on 19 January 2012, raising A$100,000 for his efforts. Though the project is called \\"Pole to Pole\\" he had stages where he was allowed to take vehicles. Therefore, the record has never been ratified. In March 2012, John Howard launched Farmer's memoirs on the journey, called Pole to pole: one man, 20 million steps. Interviewed on Radio National Breakfast, Farmer stated that proceeds of book sales would go to Red Cross's campaign for clean water programs.

Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Elizabeth Pe√±a. Set in an alternate version of the 1960s, the film follows the Parrs, a family of superheroes who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate, and attempt to live a quiet suburban life. Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan- turned-foe. Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after Warner Bros.‚Äô box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score. The film premiered on October 27, 2004, at the BFI London Film Festival and had its general release in the United States on November 5, 2004. It performed well at the box office, grossing $633 million worldwide during its original theatrical run. The Incredibles received widespread approval from critics and audiences, winning two Academy Awards and the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. A sequel, Incredibles 2, was released on June 15, 2018.  Plot  Public opinion turns against Superheroes due to the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government, including Rick Dicker, initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, which forces Supers to permanently adhere to their secret identities and abandon their exploits. Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen Parr‚Äîformerly known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl‚Äîand their children, Violet, Dash, and baby, Jack-Jack, are a suburban family living in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and white-collar job. Together with his best friend, Lucius Best, formerly known as Frozone, Bob occasionally relives \\"the glory days\\" by moonlighting as a vigilante. One day, after his supervisor, Gilbert Huph, prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper and injures him, resulting in his dismissal. Returning home, Bob receives a message from a woman called Mirage, who gives him a mission to destroy a savage tripod-like robot, the Omnidroid, on the remote island of Nomanisan. Bob battles and disables it by tricking it into ripping out its own power source. Bob finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating. He improves his relationship with his family and begins rigorous physical training regime while awaiting another assignment from Mirage over the next two months. Finding a tear in his super suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode to have it mended. Assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, Edna also makes suits for the rest of the family. Setting out for Nomanisan once again, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom he had rejected as his sidekick and has now become a ruthless inventor and wealthy arms dealer. Having adopted the alias Syndrome, he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different superheroes to fight it, killing them in the process. Syndrome intends to send the perfected Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a \\"hero\\" himself. He will later sell his inventions so that everyone can become \\"super\\", rendering the difference meaningless. Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Elastigirl borrows a private plane to travel to Nomanisan. She finds out that Violet and Dash have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter, named Kari. Helen's radio transmissions are picked up by Syndrome, who sends anti-aircraft missiles to shoot her down. The plane is destroyed, but Helen and the kids survive and use their powers to reach the island. Helen infiltrates the base and discovers Syndrome's plan. Discontented with Syndrome's indifference when her life was threatened, Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family's survival. Helen arrives and races off with Bob to find their children. Dash and Violet are chased by Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents. Syndrome captures them all, leaving them imprisoned while he follows the rocket transporting the Omnidroid to Metroville. The Incredibles escape to Metroville in another rocket with Mirage's help. Due to its advanced artificial intelligence, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as a threat to itself and shoots off the remote control on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it and knocking him unconscious. The Incredibles and Lucius fight the Omnidroid together. Helen acquires the remote control, allowing Bob to use one of the robot's claws to destroy its power source. Returning home, the Incredibles find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap Jack-Jack and raise him as his own sidekick out of revenge. As Syndrome flies up toward his jet, Jack-Jack's own superpowers manifest and he escapes Syndrome in midair. Helen catches Jack-Jack, and Bob throws his car at Syndrome's plane as he boards it. Syndrome is sucked into the jet's turbine by his own cape and the plane explodes. Three months later, the Incredibles witness the arrival of a supervillain called the Underminer. They put on their superhero masks, ready to face the new threat together as a family.  Voice cast  Craig T. Nelson signing a Mr. Incredible poster at the film's screening on * Craig T.

Production   Writing  The Incredibles as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during an uncertain point in his film career. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had signed a production deal with Warner Bros. Feature Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, \\"Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie.\\"Paik, Karen. (2007) To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios, Chronicle Books LLC, pg. 236‚Äì37. After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.Price, p. 220Price, p. 219 He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters with a history of working for the company.Price, p. 222 In addition, it would be the company's first film in which all characters are human.Price, p. 217 Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story's family members worked out: a mom and dad, both suffering through the dad's midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes.Price, p. 221 During production, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film's story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just \\"American nonsense,\\" Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, \\"I think it's a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film.\\"Price, p. 215‚Äì216 Syndrome was originally written as a minor character who assaults Bob and Helen at the beginning of the movie, only to die in an explosion that destroys the Parrs' house (in this version, the Smiths), but he was made the main antagonist because the filmmakers liked him more than the character of Xerek, who was intended to fulfill that role. The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die, but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested to have Helen pilot the plane herself.Finding Nemo, 2004 DVD, commentary  Animation  Brad Bird wrote and directed the film. Upon Pixar's acceptance of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up a core group of people he worked with on The Iron Giant. Because of this, many 2-D artists had to make the shift to 3-D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CG \\"wonderfully malleable\\" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene \\"marvelously adaptable.\\" He found working in computer animation \\"difficult\\" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software \\"sophisticated and not particularly friendly.\\" Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar. The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and Teddy Newton, whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros. Like most computer-animated films, The Incredibles had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body‚Äîthe articulation of the character‚Äîbefore animation could even begin. Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2-D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CG. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from Disney's Nine Old Men that the crew at Pixar had \\"never really emphasized.\\" For the technical crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live- action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this. Not only did The Incredibles cope with the difficulty of animating CG humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four times the number of locations. Supervising technical director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was \\"no hardest thing,\\" alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted ‚ÄúAlpha Omega,\\" where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading, and layout, while another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed the \\"character team,\\" digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time. The skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to produce known as \\"subsurface scattering.\\"Price, p. 223 The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help. Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.Price, p. 224 Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded. Bird admitted that he \\"had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight\\" of The Incredibles, but called the film a \\"testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,\\" who were admiring the challenges the film provoked. He recalled, \\"Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.\\"Paik, Karen. (2007) To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios, Chronicle Books LLC, pg. 238‚Äì51  Casting  Lily Tomlin was originally considered for the role of Edna Mode, but later turned it down.https://www.nypost.com/2018/06/14/incredibles-edna- mode-is-based-on-these-fashion-mavens/amp/ After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode, Bird took on her voice role himself. It was an extension of the Pixar custom of tapping in-house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks. Sarah Vowell was offered the role of Violet unexpectedly; Bird wanted to cast Vowell as Violet after hearing her voice on the National Public Radio program, This American Life. Bird stated that she was \\"perfect\\" for the part and immediately called her to offer her the role.  Music  The Incredibles is the first Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's retrofuturistic design ‚Äì the future as seen from the 1960s. John Barry was the first choice to do the film's score, with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry's theme to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks; the assignment was instead given to Giacchino. Giacchino noted that recording in the 1960s was largely different from modern day recording and Dan Wallin, the recording engineer, said that Bird wanted an old feel, and as such the score was recorded on analog tapes. Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film's score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, \\"the right way\\", which consists of everyone in the same room, \\"playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy\\". Many of Giacchino's future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing, which has divided critics who feel that the recordings sometimes don't sound natural. Tim Simonec was the conductor/orchestrator for the score's recording. The film's orchestral score was released on November 2, 2004, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for best score including Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, BMI Film & TV Award, ASCAP Film and Television Music Award, Annie Award, Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and Online Film Critics Society Award and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, Satellite Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award.  Themes  Several film reviewers drew precise parallels between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. The producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being \\"the most well-trod turf on the planet,\\" but noted that he had not been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since \\"if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good\\". Some commentators took Bob's frustration with celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome's comment that \\"when everyone's super, no one will be\\" as a reflection of views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy, which Bird felt was \\"ridiculous.\\" He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas \\"two percent thought I was doing The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged.\\" Some purported that The Incredibles exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. \\"I think that's as silly of an analysis as saying The Iron Giant was left-wing. I'm definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd.\\" The film also explored Bird's dislike for the tendency of the children's comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening. In the film, Dash and Violet have to deal with villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children. On another level, both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them, such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him, or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside, in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable. Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: \\"The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me. Look, it's a mainstream animated movie, and how often are those considered thought provoking?\\"  Release  The film opened on November 5, 2004, as Pixar's first film to be rated PG (for \\"action violence\\"). Its theatrical release was accompanied with a Pixar short film Boundin'. The promotional campaign included an official website with video segments, games, and printable memorabilia. While Pixar celebrated another triumph with The Incredibles, Steve Jobs was embroiled in a public feud with the head of its distribution partner, The Walt Disney Company.Price, p. 226 This would eventually lead to the ousting of Michael Eisner and Disney's acquisition of Pixar the following year. In March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger announced that the film would be reformatted and re-released in 3D. On May 11, 2018, Disney and IMAX announced that the film would be reissued and digitally re-mastered for IMAX theaters (alongside its sequel, Incredibles 2) using their DMR Technology in a double feature for a one-day only, \\"Fan Event\\", on June 13.  Home media  The film was first released on both VHS and a two-disc collector's edition DVD set on March 15, 2005. The DVD set included two newly commissioned Pixar short films, Jack-Jack Attack and Mr. Incredible and Pals, which were made specifically for this home-video release, and Boundin', a Pixar short film that premiered alongside the feature film in its original theatrical release. The VHS release only featured the short, Boundin'. It was the highest-selling DVD of 2005, with 17.38 million copies sold. The film was also released on UMD for the Sony PSP. Disney released the film on Blu-ray in North America on April 12, 2011, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 5, 2018; this marks Disney's first 4K Blu-ray reissue on the format.  Reception   Box office  Despite concerns that the film would receive underwhelming results, the film's domestic gross was $70,467,623 in its opening weekend from 7,600 screens at 3,933 theaters, averaging $17,917 per theater or $9,272 per screen, the highest opening- weekend gross for a Pixar film (the record was later broken in 2010 by Toy Story 3, with $110,307,189), the highest November opening weekend for a Disney film (the record was broken in 2013 by Thor: The Dark World with $85.7 million), the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel animated feature (the record was broken in 2007 by The Simpsons Movie, with $74,036,787), and the highest opening weekend for a non-franchise-based film for just over five years when Avatar opened with $77,025,481. This opening was the second-highest for an animated film at the time. The film stayed at #1 in its second weekend, grossing another $50,251,359, dropping just 29 percent, and easily outgrossing new animated opener The Polar Express. The film ultimately grossed $261,441,092, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2004. Worldwide, the film grossed $631,442,092, ranking fourth for 2004. It is also the second- highest-grossing 2004 animated film behind Shrek 2 ($919.8 million).  Critical response  Wizards top 100 villains. The film received a 97% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 8.36/10. This, , makes it the 20th-highest-rated animated film of all time. The site's consensus reads \\"Bringing loads of wit and tons of fun to the animated superhero genre, The Incredibles easily lives up to its name.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, indicates the film was met with \\"universal acclaim\\", with a score of 90/100 based on reviews from 41 critics. Audiences polled for CinemaScore gave the film an \\"A+\\" on an \\"A+ to F\\" scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, writing that the film \\"alternates breakneck action with satire of suburban sitcom life\\" and is \\"another example of Pixar's mastery of popular animation.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three-and-a- half, calling it \\"one of the year's best\\" and saying that it \\"doesn't ring cartoonish, it rings true.\\" Giving the film three-and-a-half as well, People magazine found that The Incredibles \\"boasts a strong, entertaining story and a truckload of savvy comic touches.\\"Rozen, Leah (November 15, 2004), \\"The Incredibles\\". People. 62 (20):31 Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was bored by the film's \\"recurring pastiches of earlier action films\\", concluding that \\"the Pixar whizzes do what they do excellently; you just wish they were doing something else.\\" Jessica Winter of The Village Voice criticized the film for \\"playing as a standard summer action film\\", despite being released in early November. Her review, titled as \\"Full Metal Racket,\\" noted that The Incredibles \\"announces the studio's arrival in the vast yet overcrowded Hollywood lot of eardrum-bashing, metal-crunching action sludge.\\" Travers also named The Incredibles as number 6 on his list of the decade's best films, writing \\"Of all the Pixar miracles studded through the decade, The Incredibles still delights me the most. It's not every toon that deals with midlife crisis, marital dysfunction, child neglect, impotence fears, fashion faux pas, and existential angst.\\" The National Review Online named The Incredibles no. 2 on its list of the 25 best conservative movies of the last 25 years, saying that it \\"celebrates marriage, courage, responsibility, and high achievement.\\" Entertainment Weekly named the film No. 25 on its list of the 25 greatest action films ever and no. 7 on its list of the 20 best animated movies ever. IGN ranked the film as the third favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010. In 2012, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz declared The Incredibles as the greatest superhero film he has ever seen: \\"That thing works as a James Bond spoof; a meditation on identities, secret and otherwise; a domestic comedy; a statement on exceptionalism vs. mediocrity, and the perils of the nanny state‚Ä¶ And yet it all hangs together. No part feels perfunctory or stupid. It‚Äôs all deeply felt.\\" He would also later name the film as the \\"greatest action movie of the aughts, with Hero and Kung Fu Hustle following close behind.\\"  Accolades  The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating two DreamWorks films, Shrek 2 and Shark Tale, as well as Best Sound Editing at the 77th Academy Awards. It also received nominations for Best Original Screenplay (for writer/director Brad Bird) and Best Sound Mixing (Randy Thom, Gary Rizzo and Doc Kane). It was Pixar's first feature film to win multiple Oscars, followed in 2010 by Up. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called The Incredibles the year's best picture. Premiere magazine released a cross- section of all the top critics in America and The Incredibles placed at number three, whereas review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes cross-referenced reviews that suggested it was its year's highest-rated film. The film also received the 2004 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, and it was nominated for the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy. It also won the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. The American Film Institute nominated The Incredibles for its Top 10 Animated Films list. It was included on Empire's 500 Greatest Films of All Time at number 400.  Merchandising  Several companies released promotional products related to the film. In the weeks before the film's opening, there were also promotional tie-ins with SBC Communications (using Dash to promote the \\"blazing-fast speed\\" of its SBC Yahoo! DSL service) Tide, Downy, Bounce and McDonald's. Dark Horse Comics released a limited series of comic books based on the film. Toy maker Hasbro produced a series of action figures and toys based on the film. Kellogg's released an Incredibles-themed cereal, as well as promotional Pop-Tarts and fruit snacks, all proclaiming an \\"Incrediberry Blast\\" of flavor. Pringles included potato chips featuring the superheroes and quotes from the film. In July 2008, it was announced that a series of comic books based on the film would be published by BOOM! Studios in collaboration with Disney Publishing by the end of the year. The first miniseries by BOOM! was The Incredibles: Family Matters by Mark Waid and Marcio Takara, which was published from March to June 2009 and collected into a trade paperback published in July of that year.  Video games  A video game based on the film was released on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PC, and Macintosh, as well as on mobile phones. Although based on the film, several key scenes are altered from the original script. A second game, The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer, was released for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS, as well as on Windows and OS X. Taking place immediately after the film, Rise focuses on Mr. Incredible and Frozone as they battle with the Underminer, but the plot was later retconned out by Incredibles 2. A third game, The Incredibles: When Danger Calls, was released for Windows and OS X. It is a collection of 10 games and activities for the playable characters to perform. A fourth game, The Incredibles: Escape from Nomanisan Island was released as a downloadable title for PC made by Backbone Entertainment. It was an action- adventure game where the incredibles try to escape Nomanisan Island while facing wave after wave of the evil forces of their foe, Syndrome. Another game, Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure, was released on March 20, 2012, for Xbox 360. It features characters and missions from five Pixar's films: The Incredibles, Up, Cars, Ratatouille and Toy Story. The Incredibles characters also star in Disney Infinity, which was released in August 2013. The playset for The Incredibles is featured in the starter pack. A LEGO-themed video game, Lego The Incredibles, was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and is released on June 15, 2018 on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.  Sequel  Director Brad Bird stated in 2007 that he was open to the idea of a sequel if he could come up with an idea superior to the original film: \\"I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together.\\" During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. \\"I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world,\\" said Bird. \\"I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‚Äòem to click all together, I would probably wanna do that.\\" Disney announced their intentions to develop Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct and write the screenplay. Nelson, Hunter, Vowell, Jackson, Bird, and Ratzenberger returned to voice their characters, while Dash was voiced by Huck Milner as Fox's voice had deepened in the intervening years and Rick Dicker was voiced by Jonathan Banks after Bud Luckey retired in 2014. The film is a direct continuation of The Incredibles. The sequel gives Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl, a more developed plotline. The teaser trailer for the sequel premiered on November 18, 2017. Originally, Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the release dates, and Incredibles 2 was then officially released in the United States on June 15, 2018.

Under the project leadership of Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov, it became the Soviet Union's standard military and Militsya side arm in 1951. Development Shortly after the Second World War, the Soviet Union reactivated its plans to replace the Tokarev TT33 self-loading pistols and Nagant M1895 revolvers. The adoption of the future AK assault rifle relegated the pistol to a light, handy self-defence weapon. Therefore, the TT30/33 was unsuited for such a role, as it was heavy and bulky. Also, the Tokarev pistols omitted a safety and magazines were deemed too easy to lose. As a result, in December 1945, two separate contests for a new service pistol were created, respectively for a 7.62mm and 9mm pistol. It was later judged that the new 9.2√ó18mm cartridge, designed by B. V. Semin, was the best round suited for the intended role. The lower pressures of the cartridge allowed practical straight blowback operation (reducing the cost and complexity of the weapon), while retaining low recoil and good stopping power. Several engineers took part in the contest, including Korovin, Baryshev, Vojvodin, Simonov, Rakov, Klimov, Lobanov, Sevryugin, and Makarov. Special emphasis was placed on safety, user-friendliness, accuracy, weight, and dimensions. After stringent handling, reliability, and other tests, Makarov's design, influenced by the German Walther PP, stood out from the others through its sheer simplicity, excellent reliability, quick disassembly, and robustness. During April 1948, Makarov's pistol experienced 20 times fewer malfunctions than the competing Baryshev and Sevryugin counterparts, and had fewer parts. The pistol was therefore selected in 1949 for further development and optimization for mass production. Tooling was set up in the Izhevsk plant for production. After many major design changes and tweaks, the gun was formally adopted as the \\"9mm Pistolet Makarova\\", or \\"PM\\" in December 1951. As the new standard issue sidearm of the USSR, the PM was issued to NCOs, police, special forces, and tank and air crews. It remained in wide front-line service with Soviet military and police until and beyond the end of the USSR in 1991. Variants of the pistol remain in production in Russia, China, and Bulgaria. In the U.S., surplus Soviet and East German military Makarovs are listed as eligible curio and relic items by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, because the countries of manufacture, the USSR and the GDR, no longer exist. In 2003, the Makarov PM was formally replaced by the PYa pistol in Russian service, although , large numbers of Makarov pistols are still in Russian military and police service. The PM is still the service pistol of many Eastern European and former Soviet republics. North Korea and Vietnam also use PMs as standard-issue pistols, however North Korea has since switched to the CZ-75 made locally as the BaekDuSan pistol. Although various pistols had been introduced in Russian service to replace the Makarov, none have been able to entirely supplant it; the MP-443 Grach/PYa is technically the Russian military‚Äôs standard sidearm but suffers from quality control and reliability issues. In September 2019, Rostec announced its Udav pistol went into mass production as the Makarov replacement. The Udav fires 9√ó21mm Gyurza rounds which are claimed to pierce 1.4 mm of titanium or 4 mm of steel at a 100 meters.Here‚Äôs an update on the Russian handgun that will likely replace the Makarov . Military Times.com/Gear Scout. 8 January 2019.Russia to replace legendary Makarov with new pistol . France 24. 18 January 2019.https://news.ru/en/weapon/russian-new-udav-pistol- passes-military- test/http://www.armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2019/0912/104554390/detail.shtml Design The PM is a medium-size, straight-blowback-action, all-steel construction, frame-fixed barrel handgun. In blowback designs, the only force holding the slide closed is that of the recoil spring; upon firing, the barrel and slide do not have to unlock, as do locked-breech-design pistols. Blowback designs are simple and more accurate than designs using a recoiling, tilting, or articulated barrel, but they are limited practically by the weight of the slide. The 9√ó18mm cartridge is a practical cartridge in blowback-operated pistols; producing a respectable level of energy from a gun of moderate weight and size. The PM is heavy for its size by modern US commercial handgun standards, largely because in a blowback pistol, the heavy slide provides greater inertia to delay opening of the breech until internal pressures have fallen to a safe level. Other, more powerful cartridges have been used in blowback pistol designs, but the Makarov is widely regarded as particularly well balanced in its design elements. The general layout and field-strip procedure of the Makarov pistol is similar to that of the PP. However, designer N.Makarov and his team drastically simplified the construction of the pistol, improving reliability and reducing the part count to an astonishing 27, not including the magazine. This allowed considerable ease of manufacture and servicing. All of the individual parts of the PM have been optimised for mass production, robustness and interchangeability, partially thanks to captured German tooling, technology, and machinery. The chrome-lined, four- groove, 9.27mm caliber barrel is pressed and pinned to the frame through a precision-machined ring. The 7 kg recoil spring wraps around and is guided by the barrel. The spring-loaded trigger guard is pivoted down and swung to either side on the frame, allowing removal of the slide. The front sight is integrally machined into the slide, and a 3‚Äì4 mm wide textured strip is engraved on top of the slide in order to prevent aim-disturbing glare. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and multiple heights are available to adjust the impact point. The extractor is of an external spring-loaded type, and features a prominent flange preventing loss if a case should rupture. The breech face is deeply recessed in order to aid in extraction and ejection reliability. The stamped sheet steel slide-lock lever has a tail serving the purpose of ejector. The one-piece, wraparound bakelite or plastic grip is reinforced with steel inserts and has a detent inside the screw bushing preventing unscrewing during firing. The sheet-metal mainspring housed inside the grip panel powers the hammer in both the main and rebound stroke, the trigger and the disconnector, while its lower end is the heel and spring of the magazine catch. The sear spring also serves another function, powering the slide lock lever. Makarov pistol parts seldom break with normal usage, and are easily serviced using few tools. The PM has a free-floating triangular firing pin, with no firing pin spring or firing pin block. This theoretically allows the possibility of accidental firing if the pistol is dropped on its muzzle. Designer Nikolay Makarov thought the firing pin of insufficient mass to constitute a major danger. The Makarov pistol is notable for the safety elements of its design, with a safety lever that simultaneously decocks and blocks the hammer from contacting the firing pin and returns the weapon to the long-trigger-pull mode of double action when that safety is engaged. When handled properly, the Makarov pistol has excellent security against accidental discharge caused by inadvertent pressure on the trigger, e.g., in carrying the weapon in dense brush or re-holstering it. However, the heavy trigger weight in double-action mode decreases first-shot accuracy. The Bulgarian-model Makarov pistol was approved for sale in the US state of California, having passed a state-mandated drop-safety test though the certification was not renewed and it has since been removed from the roster of approved handguns. Operation The PM has a DA/SA trigger mechanism. Engaging the manual safety simultaneously decocks the hammer if cocked, and prevents movement of slide, trigger and hammer. Both carrying with safety engaged, or with safety disengaged and hammer uncocked are considered safe. The DA trigger pull is heavy, requiring a strong squeeze, trading first shot accuracy for safety. Racking the slide, manually cocking the hammer or firing a cartridge all cock the hammer, setting the trigger for the next shot to single action. The PM is a semi-automatic firearm, therefore its rate of fire depends on how rapidly the shooter squeezes the trigger. Spent cartridges are ejected some 5.5‚Äì6 meters away to the shooter's right and rear. After firing the last round, the slide is held back by the slide stop lever/ejector. Magazines can be removed from the gun via the heel release, located on the bottom of the grip. After loading a fresh magazine, the slide can be released by pressing the lever on the left side of the frame or by racking the slide and releasing it; either action loads a cartridge into the chamber and readies the pistol to fire again. Variants Parkerized and dura-painted Makarov PM. Russian production. The Makarov pistol was manufactured in several communist countries during the Cold War and afterwards; apart from the USSR itself, they were East Germany, Bulgaria, China, and post-reunification Germany, which also found itself with several thousand ex-GDR Makarov pistols. The most widely known variant, the PMM (Pistolet Makarova Modernizirovannyy or Modernised Makarov pistol), was a redesign of the original gun. In 1990, a group of engineers reworked the original design, primarily by increasing the load for the cartridge. The result is a significant increase in muzzle velocity and generation of 25% more gas pressure. The PMM magazine holds 12 rounds, compared to the PM's eight rounds. Versions that held ten rounds were produced in greater quantities than the 12-round magazine. The PMM is able to use existing 9.2√ó18mm PM cartridges and has other minor modifications such as more ergonomic grip panels as well as flutes in the chamber that aid in extraction. As of 2015, it is‚Äîalongside MP-443 Grach‚Äîthe service pistol of the Russian Airborne Troops. A silenced version of the Makarov pistol, the PB, was developed for use by reconnaissance groups and the KGB, with a dedicated detachable suppressor. An experimental variant of the Makarov pistol, the TKB-023, was designed with a polymer frame to reduce the weight and costs of the weapon. It had passed Soviet military trials but was never fielded, due to concerns about the polymer's capacities for long-term storage and use. Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have developed their own handgun designs chambering the 9√ó18mm round. Hungary developed the FEG PA-63, Poland the P-64 and the P-83 Wanad and Czechoslovakia the vz.82. While similar in operation (straight blowback), and chambered for the same round, these pistols are often found labeled at gun shows by some US gun retailers as \\"Polish Makarovs\\" and \\"Hungarian Makarovs\\". Nonetheless, these cosmetically similar designs are independent of the PM and have more in common with the Walther PP (which, in fact, was also a major influence on the original Russian Makarovworld.guns.ru Quote: \\"almost immediately after the war the GAU issued a new set of requirements for a military and police pistol. These requirements asked for a compact, double action pistol of the Walther PP type...\\". Retrieved 27 April 2013.). A wide variety of aftermarket additions and replacements exist for the Makarov pistol, including replacement barrels, custom grips, custom finishes and larger sights with various properties to replace the notoriously small originals. A scope/light mount exists for the Makarov pistol but requires a threaded replacement barrel. Baikal Baikal is a brand developed by IGP around which a series of shotgun products were designed from 1962. After the collapse of the USSR, commercial gun manufacture was greatly expanded under the Baikal brand. During the 1990s, Baikal marketed various Makarov-derived handguns in the United States under the IJ-70 model. Included were handguns in both standard and high-capacity frames. They were available in .380 ACP in addition to the standard 9 mm Makarov round. Some minor modifications were made to facilitate importation into the United States, including the replacement of the rear fixed sight with an adjustable sight (only these Russian models marketed abroad feature an adjustable sight). A sporting version is the Baikal-442.' \\"BAIKAL-442\\" Sporting Pistol (for export)' The importation of these commercial models into the U.S. was later further restricted with the U.S. Government's importation ban on Russian firearms. The Baikal IZH-79-8 is a modified version of the standard Makarov pistol, with an 8 mm barrel, modified to allow it to fire gas cartridges. These guns proved popular after the fall of the USSR, and were used in Eastern Europe for personal protection. However, unlike most gas firing guns, the body is made of standard Makarov-specification steel. Users * Jones, Richard D. Jane's Infantry Weapons 2009/2010.

The noise may be frightening, typically occurs only occasionally, and is not a serious health concern. People may also experience a flash of light. Pain is typically absent. The cause is unknown. Potential explanations include ear problems, temporal lobe seizure, nerve dysfunction, or specific genetic changes. Potential risk factors include psychological stress. It is classified as a sleep disorder or headache disorder. People often go undiagnosed. There is no high quality evidence to support treatment. Reassurance may be sufficient. Clomipramine and calcium channel blockers have been tried. While the frequency of the condition is not well studied, some have estimated that it occurs in about 10% of people. Females are reportedly more commonly affected. The condition was initially described at least as early as 1876. The current name came into use in 1988.  Signs and symptoms  Individuals with exploding head syndrome hear or experience loud imagined noises as they are falling asleep or waking up, have a strong, often frightened emotional reaction to the sound, and do not report significant pain; around 10% of people also experience visual disturbances like perceiving visual static, lightning, or flashes of light. Some people may also experience heat, strange feelings in their torso, or a feeling of electrical tinglings that ascends to the head before the auditory hallucinations occur. With the heightened arousal, people experience distress, confusion, myoclonic jerks, tachycardia, sweating, and the sensation that feels as if they have stopped breathing and have to make a deliberate effort to breathe again. The pattern of the auditory hallucinations is variable. Some people report having a total of two or four attacks followed by a prolonged or total remission, having attacks over the course of a few weeks or months before the attacks spontaneously disappear, or the attacks may even recur irregularly every few days, weeks, or months for much of a lifetime. Some individuals hold the belief that EHS episodes are not natural events, but are the effects of directed energy weapons which create an auditory effect. Thus, EHS has been worked into conspiracy theories, but there is no scientific evidence that EHS has non-natural origins.  Causes  The cause of EHS is unknown. A number of hypotheses have been put forth with the most common being dysfunction of the reticular formation in the brainstem responsible for transition between waking and sleeping. Other theories into causes of EHS include: * Minor seizures affecting the temporal lobe * Ear dysfunctions, including sudden shifts in middle ear components or the Eustachian tube, or a rupture of the membranous labyrinth or labyrinthine fistula * Stress and anxiety * Variable and broken sleep, associated with a decline in delta sleep * Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome * Temporary calcium channel dysfunction *PTSD Diagnosis Classification Exploding head syndrome is classified under other parasomnias by the 2014 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd.Ed.) and is an unusual type of auditory hallucination in that it occurs in people who are not fully awake. According to ICD-10 and DSM-5 EHS is classified as either another specified sleep-wake disorder (codes:780.59 or G47.8) or unspecified sleep-wake disorder (codes: 780.59 or G47.9).World Health Organization. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. 10th ed. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization; 2008.American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-5. 5th ed. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association; 2013.  Treatment  , no clinical trials had been conducted to determine what treatments are safe and effective; a few case reports had been published describing treatment of small numbers of people (two to twelve per report) with clomipramine, flunarizine, nifedipine, topiramate, carbamazepine. Studies suggest that education and reassurance can reduce the frequency of EHS episodes. There is some evidence that individuals with EHS rarely report episodes to medical professionals. Epidemiology There have not been sufficient studies to make conclusive statements about how common or who is most often affected. One study found that 14% of a sample of undergrads reported at least one episode over the course of their lives, with higher rates in those who also have sleep paralysis. History Case reports of EHS have been published since at least 1876, which Silas Weir Mitchell described as \\"sensory discharges\\" in a patient. However, it has been suggested that the earliest written account of EHS was described in the biography of the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes in 1691. The phrase \\"snapping of the brain\\" was coined in 1920 by the British physician and psychiatrist Robert Armstrong-Jones. A detailed description of the syndrome and the name \\"exploding head syndrome\\" was given by British neurologist John M. S. Pearce in 1989. More recently, Peter Goadsby and Brian Sharpless have proposed renaming EHS \\"episodic cranial sensory shock\\" as it describes the symptoms more accurately (including the non-auditory elements) and better attributes to Mitchell.

His first reign ended when he was deposed in 1842, and his second when he was assassinated in 1868. He is considered to be a great reformer and the most enlightened ruler of modern Serbia, as one of the European enlightened absolute monarchs. He advocated the idea of a Balkan federation against the Ottoman Empire. Early life Michael was the son of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (1780‚Äì1860) and his wife Ljubica Vukomanoviƒá (1788‚Äì1843, Vienna). He was born in Kragujevac, the second surviving son of the couple. He spent his childhood in Kragujevac, then in Po≈æarevac and Belgrade. Having finished his education in Po≈æarevac, Michael left Serbia with his mother to go to Vienna. His elder brother by four years, Milan Obrenoviƒá II, born in 1819, was frequently in poor health. First reign Initially, Prince Milo≈° abdicated in favour of his firstborn Milan Obrenoviƒá II, who was by then terminally ill and died after just one month of rule. Michael came to the throne as a minor, having been born in late 1823, and acclaimed prince on June 25, 1839. He was declared of full age the following year. Few thrones appeared more secure, and his rule might have endured throughout his life but for his want of energy and inattention to political developments. In his first reign, his inexperience meant he did not cope well with the challenges Serbia faced. In 1842, his reign was ended by a rebellion led by Toma Vuƒçiƒá-Peri≈°iƒá, which enabled the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty to assume power. Life in exile After the overthrow, Prince Michael withdrew from Serbia across the Sava and Danube with around one thousand of his adherents. His destiny was decided by Austria and Turkey. Prince Michael was directed to the estate of his sister Savka Nikoliƒá, while Princess Ljubica was sent to Novi Sad. She died there in 1843. Michael organized her burial at Kru≈°edol monastery. He wrote to Vuƒçiƒá in 1853 to say that he did not want to recover the throne by violence. The prince later moved to Vienna with his father, Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. There he managed his father's large estate. At that time, he wrote the poem \\"≈†to se bore misli moje. He married Countess J√∫lia Hunyady de K√©thely (August 26, 1831 ‚Äì February 19, 1919), the daughter of Count Ferenc Hunyady de K√©thely and Countess J√∫lia Zichy de Zich and V√°sonke≈ë. The marriage was childless, although he had at least one illegitimate child by a mistress whose identity is unknown. While in exile, he learned to speak French and German fluently. Second reign and assassination Society of Serbian Scholarship members at the first meeting on June 8, 1842. Michael was accepted back as Prince of Serbia after 18 years in exile, in September 1860, after the death of his father who had regained the throne in 1858. For the next eight years, he ruled as an enlightened absolute monarch. During his second reign, the People's Assembly was convened just three times, in 1861, 1864 and 1867. Prince Michael's greatest achievement was in persuading the Turkish garrisons to leave Serbia, in 1862 (when the Ottoman Army left the fortresses of U≈æice and Soko Grad) and 1867 (when the Turks left their fortifications in Belgrade, ≈†abac, Smederevo and Kladovo). This was achieved with major diplomatic support from Russia and Austria. In 1866‚Äì68, Michael forged The First Balkan Alliance by signing the series of agreements with other Balkan entities. During his rule, the first modern Serbian coins were minted. He was also the first in modern Serbian history to declare Belgrade the capital city of the country. Michael wished to divorce his wife, Julia, in order to marry his young mistress, Katarina Konstantinoviƒá, the daughter of his first cousin, Princess Anka Obrenoviƒá. Both resided at the royal court at his invitation. His plans for a divorce and subsequent remarriage to Katarina met with much protest from politicians, clergy and the general public. His astute and gifted Prime Minister Ilija Gara≈°anin was dismissed from his post in 1867 for daring to voice his opposition to the divorce. However, the divorce never took place. While Prince Michael Obrenoviƒá was gradually introducing absolutism, a conspiracy was formed against him. The main organizers and perpetrators were the brothers Radovanoviƒá, who wanted to avenge their brother, Ljubomir Radovanoviƒá, who was in prison. Kosta Radovanoviƒá, the main perpetrator, was a wealthy and respected merchant. His brother, Pavle Radovanoviƒá, was with him during the assassination, and the third of the brothers, ƒêorƒëe Radovanoviƒá, was also involved. On June 10, 1868, Michael was travelling with Katarina and Princess Anka in a carriage through the park of Ko≈°utnjak near his country residence on the outskirts of Belgrade.Celia Hawkesworth Voices in the Shadows: Women and Verbal Art in Serbia and Bosnia, Google Books, 2000, retrieved June 16, 2010 In the park appeared Pavle and Kosta Radovanoviƒá in formal black suits, and pointing a loaded gun at the Prince, Kosta approached the carriage. Prince Michael Obrenoviƒá recognized him, because of a dispute over his brother Ljubomir. The last words of the Prince, which Kosta himself admitted when on trial were: \\"Well, it's true.\\" Michael and Anka were shot dead, and Katarina wounded. Further details of the plot behind the assassination have never been clarified; the sympathizers and cousins of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty were suspected of being behind the crime, but this has not been proven. Anka's granddaughter Natalija Konstantinoviƒá was married in 1902 to the Montenegrin Prince Mirko Petroviƒá-Njego≈° (1879‚Äì1918), whose sister Zorka had married King Petar Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá I in 1883. He was awarded Order of Prince Danilo I, Order of the White Eagle (Russian Empire), Order of Saint Anna, Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky, Order of the Redeemer, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, Order of the Medjidie, Order of Glory (Ottoman Empire) and Order of Leopold (Austria).

The lake is approximately long and wide at its greatest width. The surface area is approximately . The maximum depth is about . The shoreline is about of which all but are privately owned. The lake's name comes from the now-extinct Erie language. Because the Erie people were defeated in the Beaver Wars before a comprehensive study of their language could be made, its meaning remains unknown and a source of speculation, with two longstanding folk translations being ‚Äúbag tied in the middle‚Äù and ‚Äúplace where fish are taken out,‚Äù the latter having some support based on similar words in other Iroquoian languages. A Seneca legend, dating at least to the days of Seneca diplomat John Cornplanter Abeel, attests to the Chautauqua having a reputation as a \\"place of easy death.\\" Geography While the lake has a similar geologic structure (a very long, narrow valley) to the Finger Lakes in the east, it is not considered one of the Finger Lakes. Chautauqua Lake runs perpendicular to the westernmost of those lakes (much like an opposable thumb), lies in a different watershed, and was likely formed by a different process. Chautauqua Lake, at an elevation of above sea level, is higher than any of the Finger Lakes. It is also one of the highest navigable lakes in North America. The water from the lake drains to the south, emptying first into the Chadakoin River in Jamestown, New York, before traveling east into Cassadaga Creek and Conewango Creek, south into the Allegheny River in Warren, Pennsylvania, and the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, instead of moving north into the Great Lakes. Chautauqua Creek and Little Chautauqua Creek have their headwaters near the lake, but flow north into lake Erie. The drainage divide was spanned by Pierre-Joseph C√©loron de Blainville in his 1749 Ohio River expedition that started from Montreal, and the town of Celoron at the southern end of the lake is named for him. The lake's drainage area is about . Also at the southern end of the lake is the City of Jamestown while the Village of Mayville is located at the northern end. Other communities located on the lake are Bemus Point, Maple Springs, Lakewood and Chautauqua, the site of the influential Chautauqua Institution founded in 1874. There are many other settlements located on the lake, including Fluvanna, Greenhurst, Dewittville, Stow, and Ashville Bay. Tourism and recreation Fourth of July The lake is used primarily for recreation, such as boating and fishing, and tourism. The majority of tourists flock to the Chautauqua Institution, which contains a wide variety of stores and restaurants and is home to live music entertainment and many public lectures during the summer months. Chautauqua Lake is known for its muskellunge fishing and sailing. There are two very popular boating locations on the lake, \\"Sandy Bottoms\\", and Long Point State Park, located near Maple Springs. On busy, warm weekends, it is not uncommon to see nearly 100 boats in this area of the lake. Every Fourth of July, fireworks are launched from communities around the lake. There is one bridge that connects the opposite sides of the lake, the Veterans Memorial Bridge (also known as the Chautauqua Lake Bridge). The structure was completed on October 30, 1982 and joins Bemus Point to Stow on I-86 (at the time known as Route 17). Prior to the construction of the bridge, the only means for cars to cross the lake was the Bemus Point‚ÄìStow ferry, a nine car cable guided ferry, which still operates during the summer months and has become more of a tourist attraction. The cost of the ferry ride is free, though donations are accepted, and it is operated by the Sea Lion Project Ltd. The lake is the home of the Chautauqua Belle, a replica sternwheeler steamboat constructed in 1975 for the US Bicentennial, which offers sightseeing cruises on the lake. The Summer Wind, The Village Casino, and The Italian Fishermen are additional attractions on the lake during the summer months. Visitors can schedule a lake tour or dinner cruise on The Summer Wind, a floating leisure shuttle departs from Celoron at the southern end of the lake. Bemus Point offers The Village Casino, a restaurant and bar that can easily be reached by boat. Boaters are able to tie up at the Casino's dock where waitresses will serve them from their location. This establishment also has historical value in the area and offers nightlife on the lake. Contrary to its name, the Casino does not offer gambling. The Italian Fishermen, also in Bemus Point, offers fine dining and a floating stage during the summer with live bands and events scheduled at various times throughout the warm season. Two yacht clubs are located at the lake, Chautauqua Lake Yacht Club in Lakewood and Chautauqua Yacht Club in Chautauqua. In popular culture Chautauqua Lake is mentioned in at least one episode of I Love Lucy. Lucille Ball (a native of nearby Celoron, New York), playing the role of Lucy Ricardo, finds a stuffed and mounted fish in a trunk in her attic and recalls that Ricky caught it at Chautauqua Lake, and was so thrilled that he had mounted and kept it.For further information, see Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Center and SaveLucyDesiCenter.org . Chautauqua Lake is of major significance in the novel Wish You Were Here by Stewart O'Nan, published in 2002. The German translation of the title was Abschied von Chautauqua, which means \\"A Farewell from Chautauqua\\". It is also the origin and namesake of the Chautauqua adult education movement, which was heavily referenced in the novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig.

S. Heath beginning in 1914, subsequently by Leaf, Inc., and since 1996 by Hershey. Shaped as a thin hard slab with a milk chocolate coating, the toffee originally contained sugar, butter, and almonds, and was a small squarish bar weighing 1 ounce. It is similar to Hershey's Skor bar and Mondelƒìz's Daim bar. The Heath bar ranked 56th nationally in the US and 110th on the US East Coast in a 1987 popularity survey, and has become a popular add-in ingredient to ice cream, cookies and other confections. History In 1913, L. S. Heath, a school teacher, bought an existing confectionery shop in Robinson, Illinois, as a likely business opportunity for his oldest sons, Bayard Heath and Everett Heath. The brothers opened a combination candy store, ice cream parlor, and manufacturing operation there in 1914. With the success of the business, the elder Heath became interested in ice cream, and opened a small dairy factory in 1915. His sons worked on expanding their confectionery business. At some point they reportedly acquired a toffee recipe, via a traveling salesman, from a Greek confectioner in another part of the state. In 1928, they began marketing it locally as \\"Heath English Toffee\\", proclaiming it \\"America's Finest\\". In 1931, when Bayard and Everett were persuaded by their father to sell the confectionery and work at his dairy, they brought their candy-making equipment with them, and established a retail business there. The Heaths came up with the marketing idea of including their toffee on the order form taken around by the Heath dairy trucks, so that customers could order Heath bars to be delivered along with milk and cottage cheese. Early ads promoted Heath as a virtual health bar - only the best milk chocolate and almonds, creamery butter, and \\"pure sugar cane\\". The motto at the bottom of one ad read \\"Heath for better health!\\" It was surrounded by illustrations of milk, cream, butter, cheese, and ice cream, and in a corner - a Heath bar and a bottle of soda. The latter may have been Pepsi, as the Heath Co. bottled the drink for a number of years. The Heath bar grew in national popularity during the Depression, despite its one-ounce size and the five-cent price, equal to larger bars. Made by hand until 1942, the candy was manufactured consistently on a major commercial scale after the U.S. Army placed its first order of $175,000. The Heath bar had been found to have a very long shelf life, and the Army subsequently included it in soldiers' rations throughout World War II. Popularity of the Heath bar grew after the war, although the manufacturing process remained largely a hands-on, family-run operation. All four of L. S. Heath's sons, his two daughters, and several grandchildren were involved in the business. In the 1950s, the Heath Toffee Ice Cream Bar was developed, and eventually franchised to other dairies. In the 1960s, the huge national success of the Heath bar led to disagreements within the family, with at least one grandchild, Richard J. Heath, expelled from the business in 1969, eventually publishing a book in 1995 entitled Bittersweet: The Story of the Heath Candy Co. In the 1970s, the company bought the registeredhttps://trademarks.justia.com/716/96/fenn-s-butter-brickle-english- toffee-chocolate-covered-71696525.html trademark toffee ice cream flavoring formula called Butter Brickle from The Fenn Bros. Ice Cream and Candy Co. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.The company is listed in the May 10, 1918 Confectioners Gazette (p. 20)https://buttonmuseum.org/buttons/fenns-ice-cream In 1989, with the diminishing and splintering of the Heath family, the business was sold to a Finnish company, Leaf, Inc., which in turn was acquired by Hershey in 1996. Hershey had initially created the Skor bar to compete with the Heath bar, before it bought out Leaf, Inc. Since acquiring the product, Hershey has elongated the bar to align with its competition, and it now weighs 1.4 ounces. Current ingredients are milk chocolate, sugar, vegetable oil, dairy butter (milk), almonds, salt and soy lecithin. The wrapper's vintage brown color scheme has a small seal proclaiming Heath the \\"Finest Quality English Toffee\\". Heath bars in other products Following the 1973 incorporation by Steve's Ice Cream of the candy bar as an ice-cream \\"mix-in\\", Heath bars became a significant ingredient in ice cream and other confections. Historically, variations of the bar have includedaccording to Ray Broekel in his 1982 book The Great American Candy Bar BookHeath Milk Chocolate with Peanuts, Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Crunch, Heath Milk Chocolate with Natural Cereal and Raisins, and the Double Heath bar. In the 1980s, a Heath Toffee Ice Cream Sandwich appeared, along with Heath Soft 'n Crunchy ‚Äî a soft-serve ice cream. Currently, other varieties of Heath bar‚Äìbased confections include Archway Cookies' Heath Cookie, Heath Bar Klondike bars, Baskin-Robbins' Heath Bar Shake and Dairy Queen's Heath Bar Blizzard ‚Äî as well as Heath Bar-flavored varieties of ice cream with a coffee or vanilla ice cream base, such as the ice cream formerly known as Ben and Jerry's Heath Bar Crunch, renamed Vanilla Toffee Bar Crunch in 2014, when the company stopped using actual branded Heath bars.BusinessWeek: \\"Ben & Jerry‚Äôs Takes the Heath Out of 'Coffee Crunch' in GMO Shakeup\\": http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-16/ben-and-jerry-s- takes-the-heath-out-of-coffee-crunch-in-gmo-shakeup Although the candy bar's original manufacturer, L. S. Heath, and subsequently Hershey, have supported the incorporation of the candy bar in other confections by marketing a pre- shredded variety, many vendors hand-crumble the candy bars, finding the pre- crumbled variety to be \\"too small and too dusty\\".

Then, and in later transmissions in Britain, the US and other countries it reached an unprecedented number of viewers for an art series. Clark's book of the same title, based on the series, was published in 1969. Its production standards were generally praised and set the pattern for subsequent television documentary series. The New Yorker magazine described it as revelatory for the general viewer. The BBC's DVD issue in 2005 has remained in the catalogues, and the 1969 book has never gone out of print.

Over the next eight years Clark wrote and presented series and one-off programmes on the visual arts, ranging from Caravaggio to Bruegel the Elder, Rembrandt, Goya, Van Gogh and Picasso, and a co-production for commercial television and the BBC, Royal Palaces.Stourton pp. 284 and 288 In 1966 David Attenborough, the controller of the BBC's new second television channel, BBC2, was in charge of introducing colour broadcasting to the UK, He conceived the idea of a series about great paintings as the standard-bearer for colour television, and had no doubt that Clark would be much the best presenter for it.Stourton, pp. 319‚Äì320 Clark was attracted by the suggestion, but at first declined to commit himself. He later recalled that what convinced him that he should take part was Attenborough‚Äôs use of the word \\"civilisation\\" to sum up what the series would be about. The series consists of thirteen programmes, each fifty minutes long, written and presented by Clark, covering western European civilisation from the end of the Dark Ages to the early twentieth century. As the civilisation under consideration excludes Graeco- Roman, Asian and other historically important cultures, a title was chosen that disclaimed comprehensiveness: Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark. Clark later commented, \\"I didn't suppose that anyone would be so obtuse as to think that I had forgotten about the great civilisations of the pre- Christian era and the East. However, I confess the title has worried me. It would have been easy in the eighteenth century: Speculations on the Nature of Civilisation as illustrated by the Phases of Civilised Life in Western Europe from the Dark Ages to Present Day. Unfortunately, this is no longer practicable.\\"Clark (1969), p. xvii Although the series focused chiefly on the visual arts and architecture, there were substantial sections about drama, literature, music, philosophy and socio-political movements. Clark wanted to include more about law and philosophy, but \\"I could not think of any way of making them visually interesting.\\"Hearn, p. 16 After initial mutual antipathy, Clark and his principal director, Michael Gill, established a congenial working relationship. They and their production team spent three years from 1966 filming in a hundred and seventeen locations in thirteen countries.Hearn, p. 11 The filming was to the highest technical standards of the day, and quickly went over budget; it cost ¬£500,000 by the time it was complete.Hearn, p. 14 Attenborough rejigged his broadcasting schedules to spread the cost, transmitting each episode twice during the thirteen-week run.Hearn, p, 12 Series outline 1.

The Great Thaw Chartres Cathedral Clark tells of the sudden reawakening of European civilisation in the 12th century. He traces it from its first manifestations in Cluny Abbey to the Basilica of St Denis and finally to its high point, the building of Chartres Cathedral in the early 13th century. :*The Triumph of the Church :*the Abbeys of Cluny and Moissac :*St Bernard of Clairvaux :*St Foy :*The Abbey of V√©zelay :*Gislebertus :*The Abbey of St Denis :*Chartres. 3.

Man: the Measure of all Things Botticelli's The Three Graces Visiting Florence, Clark argues that European thought gained a new impetus from its rediscovery of its classical past in the 15th century. He visits the palaces at Urbino and Mantua and other centres of (Renaissance) civilisation. :*Early Renaissance :*Leonardo Bruni :*Perspective :*Jan Van Eyck :*Botticelli :*The Palace of Urbino :*The Court of Mantua :*A Civilised Countryside. 5. The Hero as Artist Michelangelo's David Here Clark takes the viewer back to 16th century Papal Rome‚Äînoting the convergence of Christianity and antiquity. He discusses Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci; the courtyards of the Vatican; the rooms decorated for the Pope by Raphael; and the Sistine Chapel. :*Giants and Heroes :*The Decadence of the Popes :*Michelangelo :*Bound Captives :*The Sistine Chapel :*Raphael :*Leonardo Da Vinci :*Man as a Mechanism. 6.

He visits the industrial landscape of 19th century England and the skyscrapers of 20th century New York City. He argues that the achievements of the engineers and scientists‚Äîsuch as Brunel and Rutherford‚Äîhave been matched by those of the great reformers like Wilberforce and Shaftesbury. :*The Abolition of Slavery :*The Industrial Revolution :*Humanitarianism :*Isambard Kingdom Brunel :*Courbet and Millet :*Tolstoy :*Our Urge to Destruction :*God-given Genius. The series was co- produced by Gill and Peter Montagnon; the cinematographer was Kenneth McMillan; original music was composed by Edwin Astley. Gill directed episodes 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 13. Montagnon directed episodes 2, 6, 7, 9, and co- directed episode 11 with Ann Turner, who also directed episode 4.Hearn, pp. 20‚Äì32 The series was replayed on BBC Four and released in the Region 2 DVD area in 2005; a Region 1 set followed in 2006. The DVD release included a short interview with David Attenborough about the commissioning and production of the series.Hearn, p. 32 Reception Civilisation attracted unprecedented viewing figures for a high art series: 2.5 million viewers in Britain and 5 million in the US. Clark's accompanying book has never been out of print, and the BBC issued the series on DVDs which continued to sell thousands of copies every year.Stourton, p. 452 In 2016, The New Yorker echoed the words of John Betjeman, describing Clark as \\"the man who made the best telly you‚Äôve ever seen\\".Meis, Morgan. \\"The Seductive Enthusiasm of Kenneth Clark‚Äôs Civilisation\\" , The New Yorker, 21 December 2016 The magazine's reviewer continued, \\"Scholars and academics had their understandable quibbles, but for the general public the series was something like a revelation. Art-museum exhibits in both England and the U.S. reported a surge of visitors following each episode.\\" There have been complaints in recent times that by focusing on a traditional choice of the great artists over the centuries ‚Äì all men ‚Äì Clark had neglected women, and presented \\"a saga of noble names and sublime objects with little regard for the shaping forces of economics or practical politics\\".Vahimagi, Tise. \\"Clark, Sir Kenneth (1903‚Äì1983)\\" , British Film Institute, retrieved 22 June 2017 His modus operandi was dubbed \\"the great man approach\\",Beard, Mary, \\"Kenneth Clark by James Stourton: review\\" , The Guardian, 1 October 2016 and he described himself on screen as a hero-worshipper and a stick-in-the- mud.Clark (1969), pp. 346‚Äì347 He commented that his outlook was \\"nothing striking, nothing original, nothing that could not have been written by an ordinary harmless bourgeois of the later nineteenth century\\":Clark, (1977), p. 222 Detail from Raphael's The School of Athens, reproduced on the cover of the book and DVD versions of Civilisation The broadcaster Huw Weldon believed that Civilisation was \\"a truly great series, a major work ... the first magnum opus attempted and realised in terms of TV.\\"Hearn, p. 15 There was a widespread view among critics, including some unsympathetic to Clark's selections, that the filming set new standards. The series was described as \\"visually stunning\\" by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, including Paul B. Harvey in the US and Mary Beard in Britain.Harvey, Paul B. \\"The Art of Being Civilised\\" , Archaeology, Vol. 59, No. 5 (September/October 2006), pp. 52‚Äì53. In 2011 Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian of Civilisation's \\"sheer visual beauty ... the camerawork and direction ... rise to the poetry of cinema\\".Jones, Jonathan. \\"Why the BBC is right to bring us back to Civilisation\\" , The Guardian, 24 January 2011 The British Film Institute notes how Civilisation changed the shape of cultural television, setting the standard for later documentary series, from Alastair Cooke's America (1972) and Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (1973) to the present day. Sequel The BBC announced in 2015 that it was to make a ten-episode sequel to Clark‚Äôs series, to be called Civilisations (plural), with three presenters, Mary Beard, David Olusoga and Simon Schama. It would not cover western European civilisation in the same detail, but would additionally cover Graeco-Roman and non-European cultures.Anthony, Andrew. \\"Civilisations: Three presenters, 10 parts, one epic history of the world‚Äôs culture\\" , The Guardian, 27 December 2015.

He served as Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism in the Rudd and Gillard Governments from 2007 to 2013. Before entering Parliament, Ferguson spent a long career as a trade unionist, being General Secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union from 1984 to 1990 and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions from 1990 to 1996. He is the son of Jack Ferguson who was Deputy Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1984. His brother is Laurie Ferguson, also a long-serving Labor MP. Trade unionist Born in Sydney to Jack Ferguson and Mary Ellen, Ferguson was educated at St Patrick's College, Strathfield, and the University of Sydney. After leaving university, he became a research officer at the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union, eventually rising to become Assistant General Secretary, and later General Secretary in 1984, during which time he was also appointed as a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) executive board. As FMWU General Secretary, and from 1985 to 1990 as Vice President of the ACTU, Ferguson worked closely alongside the likes of Bill Kelty and Simon Crean to negotiate with the Hawke-Keating Government the Prices and Incomes Accord. After Crean's election to the House of Representatives at the 1990 election, Ferguson was elected his replacement as ACTU President, and became a member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization. For his services to industrial relations in Australia, Ferguson was admitted to the Order of Australia in 1996. Political career Ferguson won preselection for the safe Labor seat of Batman in 1995, after a deal was negotiated between the right-wing Labor Unity faction in Victoria and the ALP National Executive. At the local level, the majority Greek party membership, largely resulting from heavy branch stacking, was likely to support a candidate other than Ferguson, however no local candidate was likely to receive support from the 50 per cent vote in the preselection panel which had been elected by the Victorian ALP State Conference. The other candidates, Jenny Mikakos and Theo Theophanous, then members of competing Left factions, were forced to withdraw from a local preselection plebiscite in favour of Ferguson, as a result of these negotiations.Lyle Allan (1995), '\\"Sam Benson for Batman and Australia\\"-Labor Preselection Problems, The Ethnic Vote and the Ghost of Benson,' People and Place, Vol.3, No.3, pp.54‚Äì56Ernest Healy (1995), 'Ethnic ALP Branches ‚Äì The Balkanisation of Labor Revisited,' People and Place, Vol.3, No.3, p.48-54 After his election to the House of Representatives in March 1996, new Opposition Leader Kim Beazley appointed Ferguson as Shadow Minister for Regional and Urban Development and Shadow Minister for Transport and Infrastructure. He remained in the Shadow Cabinet under the leaderships of Simon Crean, Mark Latham and Kevin Rudd. After the latter won the 2007 election, Ferguson was appointed Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. He continued in both roles after Julia Gillard succeeded Rudd as Prime Minister in June 2010, and resigned from both in March 2013, ahead of his retirement from Parliament that August. Uranium debate Ferguson is a supporter of uranium mining in Australia and in 2005, Ferguson addressed an Australian Uranium Conference and said \\"We as a community have to be part of the ever-complex question of how we clean up the world's climate. And part of that debate is going to be nuclear power.\\" The anti-nuclear movement in Australia is stronger than in other developed countries. Friends of the Earth have strongly opposed Ferguson's advocacy for expanding the export of uranium beyond the existing three-mine policy which Ferguson sought to overturn at the ALP's national conference in April 2007. The lobby group Northern Anti Nuclear Alliance has distributed 60,000 leaflets critical of his policy in his electorate of Batman. He also supported ‚Äì in scientific terms ‚Äì the proposal of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke for Australia to become the world's storage facility for nuclear waste although he said that it was politically not possible. He told ABC Radio that it was wrong to ban uranium exports to the People's Republic of China: \\"The Labor Party adopts the view that we're open for investment. It's about economic growth and jobs in Australia. Is China to be treated any different to South Korea, Japan, France, United States? I don't think so. We don't have one rule for China in terms of overseas investment and economic growth and jobs and another rule for Japan.\\" Coal Seam Gas In the lead up to the 2015 NSW Election, Ferguson criticised NSW Labor leader Luke Foley over his proposal to ban coal seam gas extraction. A range of Labor figures have doubled down on efforts to oust Ferguson from the party. Privatisation In 2015, Ferguson come out in support for the Liberal gGvernment plan to sell 49% of the government's electricity distributors. Ferguson even went further, saying he was \\"ashamed of the Party\\" and accusing Foley and the unions of \\"deliberately misleading the public, creating unnecessary fear and trying to scare people.\\"  Career after politics  Since leaving parliament in 2013, Ferguson has continued to advocate for Australia's tourism, energy and resources sector. As of 2019, Ferguson was the chairman of the Clare Valley Wine & Grape Association, the chairman of the Advisory Board of APPEA and has commercial interests in the sector as a non-executive director of Seven Group Holdings and BG Group. Since June 2015, Ferguson has also been Chair of Tourism Accommodation Australia (TAA). On 19 May 2014, the Australian Labor Party's WA Executive endorsed a motion to expel Martin Ferguson from the Party. However he has refused to resign and continues to be a member.

He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In December 2002, he was chosen by Wisden as the greatest ODI batsman of all time, as well as the third greatest Test batsman of all time, after Sir Don Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar. Richards was voted one of the five Cricketers of the Century by a 100-member panel of experts in 2000, along with Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Shane Warne. He is also the mentor of T20 team Quetta Gladiators in Pakistan Super League. In one-day cricket, Richards was judged by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to have played the best One Day International (ODI) innings of all time. His consistent batting ability resulted in him becoming the first cricketer in ODI history to achieve 20 Man of the Match awards. Overall, Richards scored 8,540 runs in 121 Test matches at an average of 50.23, including 24 centuries. As a captain, he won 27 of 50 Test matches and lost only 8. He also scored nearly 7,000 runs in One Day Internationals and more than 36,000 in first-class cricket. Knighted for his contributions to cricket, today Richards is an occasional cricket commentator and team mentor. In 2009, Richards was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Early life Richards was born to Malcolm and Gretel Richards in St. John's, Antigua, then part of the British Leeward Islands. He attended St. John's Boys Primary School and then Antigua Grammar Secondary School on a scholarship.McDonald (1984), pp. 25‚Äì6. Richards discovered cricket at a young age. His brothers, Mervyn and Donald, both played the game, representing Antigua as amateurs, and they encouraged him to play. The young Viv initially practised with his father and Pat Evanson, a neighbour and family friend, who had captained the Antigua side.Richards (1982), pp. 22‚Äì3. Richards left school aged 18, and worked at D'Arcy's Bar and Restaurant in St. John's. He joined St. John's Cricket Club and the owner of the restaurant where he worked, D'Arcy Williams, provided him with new whites, gloves, pads and a bat. After a few seasons with St. John's C.C., he joined Rising Sun Cricket Club, where he remained until his departure to play abroad.McDonald (1984), pp. 32‚Äì3. Cricket career Richards made his first- class debut in January 1972 when he was 19. He took part in a non-competition match, representing the Leeward Islands against the Windwards: Richards made 20 and 26. His competitive debut followed a few days later. Playing in the domestic West Indian Shell Shield for the Combined Leeward and Windward Islands in Kingston, Jamaica versus Jamaica, he scored 15 and 32, top-scoring in the second innings in a heavy defeat for his side. By the time Richards was 22, he had played matches in the Antigua, Leeward Islands and Combined Islands tournaments. In 1973, his abilities were noticed by Len Creed, Vice Chairman at Somerset, who was in Antigua at the time as part of a West Country touring side.Viv Richards by Vivian Richards and David Foot. First Published 1979 by World's Work Ltd (UK). . Move to England, 1973‚Äì1974 Richards relocated to the United Kingdom, where Creed arranged for him to play league cricket for Lansdown C.C. in Bath. He made his Lansdown debut, as part of the second XI, at Weston-super-Mare on 26 April 1973. Richards was also employed by the club as assistant groundsman to head groundsman, John Heyward, to allow him some financial independence until his career was established. After his debut he was promoted to the first team where he was introduced to the Lansdown all- rounder \\"Shandy\\" Perera from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Richards cites Perera as a major influence on his cricket development especially with regards to post- game analysis. He finished his first season at Lansdown top of the batting averages and shortly afterwards was offered a two-year contract with county side Somerset. Richards then moved to Taunton in 1974 in preparation for his professional debut with Somerset CCC where he was assigned living accommodation by the club; a flat-share with two other county players: Ian Botham and Dennis Breakwell. On 27 April 1974 Richards made his Benson & Hedges Cup debut for Somerset against Glamorgan in Swansea; after the game Somerset skipper Brian Close arranged a player's ovation for Richards in recognition of his playing and contribution to the victory. Richards was awarded Man of the Match.Viv Richards Somerset Debut ‚Äì 27 April 1974 at Cricinfo. Retrieved 28 September 2015. Test debut to international stardom, 1975‚Äì1984 Richards made his Test match debut for the West Indian cricket team in 1974 against India in Bangalore. He made an unbeaten 192 in the second Test of the same series in New Delhi. The West Indies saw him as a strong opener and he kept his profile up in the early years of his promising career. In 1975 Richards helped the West Indies to win the inaugural Cricket World Cup final, a feat he later described as the most memorable of his career.\\"Your chance to ask West Indies legend Sir Viv Richards a question to be aired on Inside Cricket\\". Fox Sports. 14 December 2012. He starred in the field, running out Alan Turner, Ian Chappell and Greg Chappell. The West Indies were again able to win the following World Cup in 1979, thanks to a Richards century in the final at Lord's, and Richards believes that on both occasions, despite internal island divisions, the Caribbean came together.Croft quizzes Richards BBC online. He was until 2005 the only man to score a century and take 5 wickets in the same one-day international, against New Zealand at Dunedin in 1986‚Äì87. He rescued his side from a perilous position at Old Trafford in 1984 and, in partnership with Michael Holding, smashed 189 to win the game off his own bat. 1976 was perhaps Richards' finest year: he scored 1710 runs, at an astonishing average of 90.00, with seven centuries in 11 Tests. This achievement is all the more remarkable considering he missed the second Test at Lord's after contracting glandular fever; yet he returned to score his career-best 291 at the Oval later in the summer. This tally stood as the world record for most Test runs by a batsman in a single calendar year for 30 years until broken by Mohammad Yousuf of Pakistan on 30 November 2006. Richards had a long and successful career in the County Championship in England, playing for many years for Somerset. In 1983, the team won the NatWest Trophy, with Richards and close friend Ian Botham having a playful slugging match in the final few overs. Richards refused a \\"blank-cheque\\" offer to play for a rebel West Indies squad in South Africa during the Apartheid era in 1983, and again in 1984. West Indies captain, 1984‚Äì1991 Richards captained the West Indies in 50 Test matches from 1984 to 1991. He is the only West Indies captain never to lose a Test series, and it is said that his fierce will to win contributed to this achievement. His captaincy was, however, not without controversy: one incident was his aggressive, \\"finger- flapping\\" appeal leading to the incorrect dismissal of England batsman Rob Bailey in the Barbados Test in 1990, which was described by Wisden as \\"at best undignified and unsightly. At worst, it was calculated gamesmanship\\". This behaviour would nowadays be penalised according to Section 2.5. of the Rules of Conduct of the ICC Code of Conduct. During a match against Zimbabwe during the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Richards returned to the crease after a stoppage for bad light and accidentally took strike at the wrong end, which remains a very rare occurrence.Martin-Jenkins, p. 68. However, despite his totemic presence at Somerset, over time his performances declined as he devoted most of his time to international cricket. The county finished bottom of the County Championship in 1985, and next to bottom in 1986. New team captain Peter Roebuck became the centre of a major controversy when he was instrumental in the county's decision not to renew the contracts of Richards and compatriot Joel Garner for the 1987 season, whose runs and wickets had brought the county much success in the previous eight years. Somerset proposed to replace the pair with New Zealand batsman Martin Crowe. Consequently, Ian Botham refused a new contract with Somerset in protest at the way his friends Richards and Garner had been treated and he promptly joined Worcestershire. After many years of bitterness over the event and the eventual removal of Roebuck from the club, Richards was eventually honoured with the naming of a set of entrance gates and a stand after him at the County Ground, Taunton. After his sacking from Somerset, Richards spent the 1987 season in the Lancashire League playing as Rishton CC's professional, in preparation for the West Indies tour the following season. Richards returned to county cricket for the 1990 season towards the end of his career to play for Glamorgan, helping them to win the AXA Sunday League in 1993. After cricket Richards being interviewed after a cricket match in 2006 Richards is a commentator on BBC's Test Match Special (TMS). He was featured in the 2010 documentary movie Fire in Babylon and spoke about his experiences playing for the West Indies. He joined the Delhi Daredevils as their mentor in The Indian Premier League in 2013, and also mentored the Quetta Gladiators in the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 Pakistan Super League. Personality and playing style Quiet and self-contained away from the pitch, Richards was a very powerful right-handed batsman with an extremely attacking style, \\"possibly the most destructive batsman the sport has ever seen\\". He was also an excellent fielder and a more than competent off-spin bowler. He is often regarded as the most physically devastating and exciting batsman that ever played the game by cricketers, journalists, fans and others alike, and played his entire 17-year career without a helmet. His fearless and aggressive style of play, and relaxed but determined demeanor made him a great crowd favourite and an intimidating prospect for opposition bowlers all over the world. The word \\"swagger\\" is frequently used to describe his batting style.Cricinfo ‚Äì Emperor, empowerer His batting often completely dominated opposing bowlers. He had the ability to drive good-length balls from outside off-stump through midwicket, his trademark shot, and was one of the great exponents of the hook shot. Viv Richards was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him. So much so, that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However playing for Somerset in a county game against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas attempted to sledge Richards after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He sarcastically informed Richards: \\"It's red, round and it's about five ounces, in case you were wondering.\\" Richards then hammered the next delivery for 6, straight out of the stadium and into a nearby river. Turning back to the bowler, he commented: \\"You know what it looks like, now go and find it.\\" Hitting Across the Line In 1991, Richards published his autobiography entitled Hitting Across the Line. In the book, Richards describes how his whole life revolved around sports, cricket in particular. Of special interest is his technique, expressed by the title of the book. To hit across the line of the ball is considered taboo, and dangerously risky. However, Richards' explanation of the conditions in which he played cricket in Antigua as a child, explains how this technique came to be. Legacy and achievements Richards remains one of only four non- English cricketers to have scored 100 first-class centuries, the others being Australian Donald Bradman, New Zealander Glenn Turner and Pakistani Zaheer Abbas. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1977. In 2000, Richards was named by a 100-member panel of experts one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century. He received 25 votes, behind Sir Donald Bradman (100 votes), Sir Garfield Sobers (90 votes), Sir Jack Hobbs (30 votes) and Shane Warne (27 votes). Place in cricket history In 2000, Richards was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century, coming fifth behind Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Shane Warne in the poll of 100 international cricket experts appointed by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Several prominent personalities including former cricketer Imran Khan and writer John Birmingham are of the opinion that Richards was the best ever batsman against genuine fast bowling. For Barry Richards, Ravi Shastri and Neil Fairbrother, he has been cited as the best batsman they personally witnessed. Wasim Akram rates Richards the greatest batsman he ever bowled to, ahead of Sunil Gavaskar and Martin Crowe. Crowe himself rated Richards as the best batsman he played against, along with Greg Chappell. Arguably the two greatest spinners ever, Muthiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne both idolize Richards. Murali idolized Richards in his years growing up, while Warne rates him the greatest batsman \\"for me\\", and overall just after Bradman. The ICC has produced rankings for batsmen and bowlers for both the longer and shorter versions. In the ratings for Test Cricket, Richards holds the equal seventh highest peak rating (938), after Sir Donald Bradman (961), Steve Smith (947), Sir Len Hutton, Sir Jack Hobbs, Ricky Ponting and Peter May. The ODI ratings placed Richards in 1st followed by Zaheer Abbas and Greg Chappell. He topped the rankings at the end of the years 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1986. He was voted the greatest cricketer since 1970 in a poll, ahead of Ian Botham and Shane Warne. That poll saw both Botham and Warne vote for Richards, and in the opinions of both, Richards is the greatest batsman they ever saw. In 2006, in a study done by a team of ESPN's Cricinfo magazine, Richards was again chosen the greatest ODI Batsman ever. Former cricketer Derek Pringle also rates Richards to be the best batsman ever in the history of Limited Overs Cricket. To mark 150 years of the Cricketers' Almanack, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI. Statistical summary Richards' Test career batting chart In his Test career, he scored 8,540 runs in 121 Test matches at an average of 50.23 (including 24 centuries). Richards also scored 5 centuries in World Series Cricket between 1977‚Äì79. These are not recognised by the ICC as \\"official\\" Test centuries. Richards won 27 of 50 matches as a Test captain, and lost only 8. He is also the scorer of the equal second fastest-ever Test century, from just 56 balls against England in Antigua during the 1986 tour. He hit 84 sixes in Test cricket. His highest innings of 291 is equal seventh (along with Ramnaresh Sarwan) on the list of West Indies' highest individual scores.  International records  * In 1986, Richards became the first batsman to score a Test century at a strike rate of over 150. * Richards scored the fastest century in Test history (56 balls) in 1986, being sole record holder until his feat was first equalled by Misbah-ul-Haq in 2014 and then eclipsed by Brendon McCullum's 54-ball ton in 2016. * Richards set a record for being the fastest batsman to 1,000 ODI runs (21 innings); this record has subsequently been equaled by Kevin Pietersen, Babar Azam, Jonathan Trott and Quinton de Kock in just 21 innings. * He along with Michael Holding set the record for the highest ever 10th wicket partnership in ODI history.(106*) * He also holds the record for the highest individual ODI score when batting at number 4 position(189*) * He became the first player to score a fifty and to take a five wicket haul in the same ODI.

The APA was formed in 1978, when two separate professional planning organizations, the American Institute of Planners and the American Society of Planning Officials, were merged into a single organization. The American Institute of Certified Planners is now the organization's professional branch.  Functions  Like many professional organizations, the American Planning Association's main function is to serve as a forum for the exchange of ideas between people who work in the field of urban planning. The organization keeps track of the various improvement efforts underway around the country, which may include the improvement or construction of new parks, highways and roads, or residential developments. The organization is also a starting point for people looking for employment. The association also publishes the Journal of the American Planning Association (JAPA, ). JAPA was founded in 1935 as Planners' Journal, and was from 1943 known as Journal of the American Institute of Planners (). National Planning Conference The American Planning Association holds an annual national conference which attracts planners, local government officials, planning commissioners, advocates and planning students from across the United States, Canada and the world. Each conference now hosts several hundred individual sessions with thousands of attendees. Future conferences are planned for: * San Francisco, CA (2019) * Houston, TX (2020) * Boston, MA (2021) The association is subdivided into 47 state/regional chapters, such as the NJAPA (New Jersey Chapter of the APA) or the Western Central Chapter of the APA.  Chapters  APA members in the United States are required to belong to a local chapter. Many APA Chapters meet regularly, and most are a source for local conferences and education, networking. Each of 47 local chapters publishes a newsletter and maintains a presence on the web and on social media.  Divisions  To manage the various interests of American planners, the APA has created 21 divisions.APA Divisions Web Page 21 APA Divisions. Retrieved 29 January 2009. APA divisions offer professional networking opportunities for planners. They also produce newsletters and special publications, develop conference sessions, collaborate with related organizations, and contribute to policy work. The divisions focus on planning strategies for professionals with focused interests.

Fitzgibbon is aligned with the ALP's Centre Unity faction in NSW. From December 2007 to June 2009 he was the Minister for Defence in the First Rudd Ministry. He resigned from cabinet in June 2009, following a series of controversies. In July 2013, following Kevin Rudd's election as Labor Leader, he was appointed the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Second Rudd Ministry. Background Joel Fitzgibbon was born in Bellingen, New South Wales, and is the son of Eric Fitzgibbon who was MP for Hunter 1984‚Äì96. Before entering politics Fitzgibbon was an automotive electrician, electorate officer, part-time technical education lecturer and small business operator. He was a member of the Cessnock City Council in the period 1987‚Äì95. Political career Joel's father, Eric Fitzgibbon, retired before the 1996 election, and Joel won Labor preselection for the seat. Hunter is one of Labor's few country strongholds; it has been in Labor hands without interruption since 1910. While Joel Fitzgibbon suffered a seven-point swing in 1996, he has been re-elected with little trouble since then, with the exception of the 2013 election, where his margin was significantly reduced. He was elected to the opposition shadow ministry in October 1998 and was appointed Shadow Minister for Mining, Energy and Forestry in 2003‚Äì05. In June 2005 he was appointed shadow assistant treasurer and shadow minister for revenue and for small business and competition. In early December 2006, when Kevin Rudd became leader of the opposition, Fitzgibbon was appointed shadow minister for defence. He was subsequently appointed minister for defence when Labor won office at the 2007 federal election. Minister for Defence In 2008 Fitzgibbon expressed dissatisfaction with an unclassified briefing he received on an assessment of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). He subsequently ordered and received a classified report that addressed his concerns, and then expressed confidence in the JSF project. In the same interview, he denied any personal involvement in the Australian Federal Police (AFP) raid on the home of Canberra Times' journalist Philip Dorling, although he did not guarantee that his department had not contacted the AFP. Dorling was accused of receiving confidential cabinet documents intended for Fitzgibbon. On 22 October 2008, Fitzgibbon instructed the Department of Defence to cease debt recovery procedures against SAS soldiers who had been accidentally overpaid. A subsequent audit by KPMG discovered that the soldiers' pay continued to be docked after the ministerial instruction. In May 2009, Fitzgibbon announced a new defence white paper titled Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030. Controversy On 26 March 2009, Fairfax Media reported that officers in the Department of Defence had conducted a covert and unauthorised investigation into Fitzgibbon's friendship with a Chinese- Australian businesswoman in the belief that it constituted a security risk. This was alleged to have included officers from the Defence Signals Directorate accessing the computer network in Fitzgibbon's office to obtain the woman's bank details. The Department launched an urgent inquiry into the reports. Nick Warner, the Department's Secretary, stated that he had not seen any information to confirm the claims and that there were no circumstances in which secret investigations into Ministers could be authorised. Fitzgibbon was reported to be \\"furious\\" about the investigation, and suggested that it may have been conducted by officials opposed to his reforms to the Australian Defence Organisation. Fitzgibbon resigned as Minister for Defence on 4 June 2009 after admitting that meetings held between his brother Mark Fitzgibbon, the head of the health fund NIB, and Defence officials concerning business opportunities had breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct. In 2013, Fitzgibbon reflected on his term as Defence Minister and said that the defence chiefs had an obsession for the JSF and had refused to consider other alternatives. 43rd Parliament Following his re-election in the 2010 federal election, Fitzgibbon was elected by the Labor caucus as chief government whip. Following the June 2013 Labor leadership spill, Fitzgibbon was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Second Rudd ministry. 2015 proposed abolition of Hunter In 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission announced plans to abolish the federation seat of Hunter. Due to changing populations, overall New South Wales was to lose a seat while Western Australia was to gain an extra seat. Electors in the north of Hunter were to join New England. The roughly 40 percent remainder were to become part of Paterson, with the Liberal margin calculated to be notionally reduced from 9.8 to just 0.5 points as a result. Since the Commission's guidelines require it to preserve the names of original electorates where possible, the commission proposed renaming Charlton to Hunter. The final plan, however, saw Charlton abolished, with Hunter pushed slightly eastward to absorb much of Charlton's former territory. While most of the new Hunter's voters come from the old Charlton, as previously mentioned, Commission guidelines required the name of Hunter to be retained. The Labor incumbent for Charlton, Pat Conroy, opted to contest neighbouring Shortland in order to allow Fitzgibbon to contest the new Hunter. 2019 election and aftermath In the 2019 federal election, Fitzgibbon suffered a 9.5-point swing against him in his electorate, reducing his margin to just 3 points. After the election, he was a vocal critic of his party's direction, claiming that \\"Labor must reconnect with its blue-collar base and get back to the centre\\". He stated that he was considering running in the leadership ballot if other candidates do not \\"show more interest in regional Australia\\". He later endorsed Anthony Albanese as leader, who won unopposed. Political positions As the Labor Shadow Agriculture spokesman, Fitzgibbon opposed the Government's decision to stop the sale of S. Kidman & Co as \\"political\\" and accused it of running a \\"discriminatory foreign investment regime\\". Fitzgibbon serves as the convenor of the NSW Right faction in federal parliament.

It was hosted by Walter Cronkite. The opening and closing theme music was written by composer George Antheil. The program presented filmed reports on news and cultural events that were important for the development of the 20th century. The show did not just present the events, but also interpreted them. Such subjects as World War I and major assassinations were presented in context. On 20 January 1967, the show, sponsored by Union Carbide (\\"The Discovery Company\\"), was renamed The 21st Century. The show's focus changed to the future and to what humankind could look forward to. The 21st Century was cancelled after three seasons (its final broadcast was on 4 January 1970). The reason given was that the writers had run out of things to talk about. However, CBS may have wished to replace it with a more commercially successful program.

The company operates 68 television channels and 31 radio stations in Germany, France and other European countries. It also offers national streaming platforms, content productions and a range of digital services. Important segments of RTL Group are Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, Groupe M6, Fremantle, RTL Nederland and RTL Belgium. The company, in its present form, was established by Bertelsmann, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) and Pearson in the year 2000. Over the years, Bertelsmann, a conglomerate based in the German city of G√ºtersloh, continued to increase its stake in RTL Group and currently owns just over 75% of the shares in the company after holding a stake of more than 90% in the past. RTL Group is one of a total of eight divisions of Bertelsmann: It is responsible for more than a third of its revenue and a large share of its operating profit.  History   Historical background  The roots of RTL Group date back to the 1920s. The company itself was established in 1931 as the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion (known as CLR for short). It was one of the world's first private broadcasting companies. After the Second World War, the company ventured into the world of television broadcasting. It was renamed Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de T√©l√©diffusion (CLT) to reflect this new service in 1954. Under the name RTL (for Radio T√©l√©vision Luxembourg), it went on to provide its private broadcasting services in several European countries. When the European media markets were liberalised in the 1980s, television became increasingly important and started to overtake radio. In the 1980s, Belgian and French media companies made up the majority of the shareholders of CLR and CLT. The following decades witnessed repeated conflicts for domination within the company and among its subsidiaries. In the 1990s, Bertelsmann ultimately came out on top after having gradually increased its stake in the German television channel RTL. Following a legal dispute with RTL/CLT, Bertelsmann announced plans to merge the television businesses of UFA to form the joint venture CLT- UFA in 1996. As a result, German television channels such as RTL Television and VOX and international broadcasting services, including M6 in France, were all brought together under one roof.  Growth and stock market launch  CLT-UFA not only grew organically but also increased in size due to a number of acquisitions. In the year 2000, Bertelsmann and Pearson announced plans to merge their television, radio and production activities. The two companies joined forces to create RTL Group, Europe's leading network of television channels and radio stations with a global content business, which was rebranded FremantleMedia in 2001 (now called Fremantle). This merger was designed to provide a strong European response to the US-American media dominance. RTL Group was first listed on the London Stock Exchange on 26 July 2000. The existing shell of Audiofina, which was already a listed company, was used to simplify the administrative effort involved in the stock market launch. The issue price of the RTL Group share was calculated based on the closing prices of Audiofina in Luxembourg and Brussels. The RTL Group share consequently replaced the Audiofina listing.  Acquisition by Bertelsmann  Although Bertelsmann initially only held a minority share in RTL Group, the German conglomerate managed by Thomas Middelhoff set its sights on playing a leading role within the group. After exchanging shares with the Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) in 2001, Bertelsmann achieved its goal of becoming the majority shareholder of RTL Group and thus secured a leading position in the European television market. Over the years, Bertelsmann increased its stake in RTL Group to more than 90%. Bertelsmann's initial aim was to acquire full ownership of RTL Group to reduce administrative costs, but this plan failed in 2007 due to uncertainties in Luxembourg law. The conglomerate responded by altering its strategy and in 2013, it sold a minority interest in RTL Group on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to finance the growth of Bertelsmann and especially its digital transformation. Media reports responded positively to the secondary listing of RTL Group and the resulting availability of shares open to external investors.  Recent developments  RTL Group was already responsible for a large part of the revenue and profit of Bertelsmann in 2001. In the new structure of Bertelsmann, which was introduced in 2016, the company maintained its position as an important division. Since April 2019, Thomas Rabe, chairman and chief executive officer of Bertelsmann, has also simultaneously been at the helm of RTL Group. Under his management, the company is pursuing the objective of strengthening its core businesses, establishing local streaming services and further developing advertising technologies. Fostering its alliances and partnerships with other companies in the European media industry also plays an important role in the current strategy of RTL Group.  Corporate affairs  RTL Group S.A. is the parent company of the entire corporate group. Its legal form is a soci√©t√© anonyme, a public limited company under Luxembourg law. It was entered into the Luxembourg Trade Register on 29 March 1973. The company's main corporate objective is to develop audio-visual media and to lead and manage other companies active in the same field.  Listing  RTL Group S.A. currently has a net worth of ‚Ç¨191,845,074. It is divided into 154,742,806 shares without nominal value, which are traded on the Luxembourg and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges. RTL Group S.A. shares are included in the German SDAX, a stock index for medium-sized companies. They are also included in the SXMP, a sector index for the European media industry. Bertelsmann holds more than 75% of the shares in RTL Group S.A. The second-largest shareholder is Silchester International Investors, a British investment company based in London, which has a stake of around 5%. This shareholding forms part of the group's free float, which has at a stable value of between 20 and 25%.  Management  The highest authority of RTL Group S.A. is its board of directors, in which the power to manage and control the group's business is vested. The Board of Directors has 13 members; there are currently eleven men and two women serving on the Board. Martin Taylor is the Chairman of the Board of Directors; the other members are Thomas G√∂tz, Elmar Heggen, Immanuel Hermreck, Bernd Hirsch, Bernd Kundrun, Guillaume de Posch, Thomas Rabe, Jean-Louis Schiltz, Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, James Singh, Bettina Wulf and Lauren Zalaznick. The operational business of RTL Group is headed by Thomas Rabe (Chief Executive Officer, CEO), Elmar Heggen (Chief Operating Officer, COO and Deputy CEO) and Bj√∂rn Bauer (Chief Financial Officer, CFO). Together they form the executive committee of RTL Group S.A., which is supported by the group management committee and operations management committee. The management boards of RTL Group are based in Luxembourg and Cologne, Germany.  Corporate centre  The headquarters of RTL Group, according to trade law, is located in the so-called \\"RTL City\\", which is located at Boulevard Pierre Frieden in the Kirchberg quarter in the north-east of Luxembourg City. Bertelsmann initially planned to sell the complex and lease it back in 2017 but ultimately decided to delay the transaction for an indefinite period. Besides the Luxembourg headquarters, there is another corporate centre located in the Cologne borough of Deutz, North Rhine-Westphalia.  Key figures  In the 2019 financial year, RTL Group generated revenue of around ‚Ç¨6.7 billion with a profit of ‚Ç¨1.1 billion. The revenue mainly came from advertising (44% television, 4% radio), content production (22%), digital activities (16%) and platform businesses (6%). RTL Group generated 32% of its revenue in Germany, 22% in France, 16% in the United States, 8% in the Netherlands, 4% in Great Britain and 3% in Belgium.  Divisions  RTL Group operates television channels, radio stations, streaming platforms, content production, a range of digital services and advertising sales. All of its business activities are assigned to 14 areas. The main segments of RTL Group are Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, Groupe M6, Fremantle, RTL Nederland and RTL Belgium. Divimove, RTL Croatia, RTL Hungary, RTL Luxembourg, SpotX and other businesses all fall into the \\"others\\" segment, as does the Group's minority interest in Atresmedia, a leading Spanish media company.  Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland  Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland is based in Cologne and operates the free-to-air channels RTL Television, VOX (entertainment) and ntv (news). It also offers pay-TV channels such as RTL Crime, RTL Living, RTL Passion and GEO Television. The company additionally operates a leading streaming service under the name TV Now.

She was a researcher with the South Australian Health Commission, an advertising executive, journalist and small business director before entering politics. Gallus was first elected to the seat of Hawker, based on Glenelg and the Holdfast Bay area, at the 1990 election, defeating one-term Labor incumbent Elizabeth Harvey on a razor-edge 50.01 percent two-party vote from a 1.2 percent two-party swing. Had just 14 Australian Democrats supporters ranked Harvey higher than Gallus on next preferences, Harvey would have won. Hawker was abolished ahead of the 1993 federal election. Most of its territory, including Glenelg, was absorbed into neighbouring Hindmarsh, and Gallus opted to follow most of her constituents there. Hindmarsh had long been a Labor stronghold, but had grown increasingly marginal over the last decade. Largely due to the addition of Holdfast Bay, Labor's already thin majority of 5.3 percent was pared back even further, to an extremely marginal 1.2 percent. Additionally, the election was called at a bad time for the state Labor government, which was still reeling from the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia. Indeed, the state Labor government would be heavily defeated at a state election later that year. Gallus took a substantial first-count lead and ultimately won on the eighth count, becoming only the second non- Labor MP ever to win the seat and the first since 1917. To date, it is also the only time that Labor has been in government without holding Hindmarsh. In the last couple of years of the Liberal Party's time in Opposition, which ended in 1996, Gallus was Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in which she was seen as an effective opponent against Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner when she attacked his credibility over the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. The controversy over the Hindmarsh Island bridge was believed to have cost Tickner his seat at the 1996 election. Despite this she was not picked for a place in the ministry by new Liberal Prime Minister John Howard. Gallus did, however, become Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in 2001 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs 2001‚Äì04.Gallus, Christine - Australian Women Biographical entry Gallus gained a large swing in the 1996 election, technically making Hindmarsh a safe Liberal seat. However, she had to withstand strong challenges from Labor's Steve Georganas in the next two elections. Gallus retired at the 2004 election and was replaced as the Liberal candidate by Simon Birmingham, who lost the seat to Georganas by just 108 votes.

He continued selling such anthological stories for that series and for Marvel's Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows through the end of 1970, by which time he had also published one-page, text short stories in DC's All-Star Western #1 (Sept. 1970) and Super DC Giant #S-14 (Oct. 1970). He published his first continuing-character story in DC's semi-anthological occult comic The Phantom Stranger #10 (Dec. 1970). and He attended New York University for a time. Conway recalled breaking into Marvel Comics through Marvel editor Roy Thomas: Following his first continuing- character story for Marvel, with his script for the jungle lord Ka-Zar in Astonishing Tales #3 (Dec. 1970), Conway began writing superhero stories with Daredevil #72 (Jan. 1971). He quickly went on to assignments on Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and both \\"The Inhumans\\" and \\"The Black Widow\\" features in the split book Amazing Adventures. He scripted the first Man-Thing story, in 1971, sharing co-creation credit with Stan Lee and Roy Thomas. Conway eventually scripted virtually every major Marvel title, as well as co-create (with writers Roy & Jean Thomas and artist Mike Ploog) the lycanthropic lead character of the feature \\"Werewolf by Night\\", in Marvel Spotlight #2 (Feb. 1972);Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 154: \\"Roy Thomas came up with the idea for a series called 'I, Werewolf', narrated in the first person by a teenager who transformed into a werewolf. Stan Lee liked the concept but decided to name it 'Werewolf by Night'. The initial creative team on the series was scripter Gerry Conway and artist Mike Ploog.\\" and write the premiere issue of Marvel's The Tomb of Dracula,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 155: \\"Following the revision of the Comics Code, Stan Lee was eager to do a comics series about the archetypal vampire, novelist Bram Stoker's Dracula. Based on a few ideas from Lee, Roy Thomas plotted the first issue of The Tomb of Dracula, which Gerry Conway then scripted. The interior art was penciled by Gene Colan.\\" introducing the longstanding literary vampire into the Marvel universe. Spider-Man and intercompany rotation At 19, Conway began scripting The Amazing Spider-Man, succeeding Stan Lee as writer of one of Marvel's flagship titles. His run, from issues #111‚Äì149 (August 1972 ‚Äì October 1975), included the landmark death of Gwen Stacy story in #121 (June 1973).Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 159: \\"In June [1973], Marvel embarked on a story that would have far-reaching effects. The Amazing Spider- Man artist John Romita, Sr. suggested killing off Spider-Man's beloved Gwen Stacy in order to shake up the book's status quo.\\"Manning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 68: \\"This story by writer Gerry Conway and penciler Gil Kane would go down in history as one of the most memorable events of Spider-Man's life.\\" Eight issues later, Conway and Andru introduced the Punisher as a conflicted antagonist for Spider-Man, as well as the Jackal.Manning \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 72: \\"Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man's world and the Marvel Universe in this self- contained issue. Not only would the vigilante known as the Punisher go on to be one of the most important and iconic Marvel creations of the 1970s, but his instigator, the Jackal, would become the next big threat in Spider-Man's life.\\" The Punisher became a popular star of numerous comic books and has been adapted into three movies. Conway additionally wrote Fantastic Four, from #133‚Äì152 (April 1973 ‚Äì Nov. 1974). Conway in 2009 reflected on writing flagship Marvel characters at a very young age: In the late 1972, Conway and writers Steve Englehart and Len Wein crafted a metafictional unofficial crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein's first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, \\"It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we knew that we had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It's really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back ‚Äì it didn't matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel ‚Äì I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do.\\"Amazing Adventures #16 (Jan. 1973), Justice League of America #103 (Dec. 1972), and Thor #207 (Jan. 1973) at the Grand Comics Database Conway returned to DC Comics in mid-1975, beginning with three books cover-dated Nov. 1975: Hercules Unbound #1, Kong the Untamed #3, and Swamp Thing #19. He wrote a revival of the Golden Age comic book series All Star Comics which introduced the character Power Girl. Shortly afterward, he was chosen by Marvel and DC editors to script the historic intercompany crossover Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man #1, a 96-page, tabloid-sized, $2 one-shot, at a time when comic books sold for 25 cents.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 170 \\"The tale was written by Gerry Conway and drawn by Ross Andru, both among the few [at that time] to ever have worked on both Superman and Spider-Man...The result was a defining moment in Bronze Age comics.\\" He continued writing for DC, on titles including Superman, Detective Comics (starring Batman), Metal Men, Justice League of America, 1st Issue Special #11 starring Codename: Assassin, and that of the licensed character Tarzan. Conway briefly returned to Marvel where he succeeded Marv Wolfman as editor-in-chief in March 1976, but held the job only \\"about a month-and-a-half,\\"\\"Gerry Conway on Englehart Leaving Marvel\\" (sidebar) in relinquishing the post and being succeeded by Archie Goodwin. For a time, a confluence of publishing schedules resulted in Conway stories appearing in both Marvel and DC comics in the same month: The prolific Conway's comic books with January 1977 cover-dates alone, for example, are Marvel's The Avengers, The Defenders, Captain Marvel, Iron Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 177: \\"Spider- Man already starred in two monthly series: The Amazing Spider-Man and Marvel Team-Up. Now Marvel added a third, Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man, initially written by Gerry Conway with art by Sal Buscema and Mike Esposito.\\" and the premiere issues of Ms. Marvel and Logan's Run, and Superman and Action Comics. DC Comics and later career Conway at the New York Comic Con After leaving Marvel's editorship, he again wrote exclusively for DC for the next decade writing both major and lesser titles ‚Äì from those featuring Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Legion of Super-Heroes to such books as Weird Western Tales, Atari Force and Sun Devils. He had an eight-year run on Justice League of America, writing most issues from #151‚Äì255 (Feb. 1978 ‚Äì Oct. 1986) including the double-sized anniversary issue #200 (March 1982). Conway wrote two additional Superman projects in the oversized tabloid format, Superman vs. Wonder Woman, drawn by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, and Superman vs. Shazam, drawn by Rich Buckler. He co-created the characters Firestorm with artist Al MilgromMcAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 177 \\"If inventiveness is the fusion of ideas, then Firestorm was one of the most original characters to emerge from a comic book in years.

He returned to Marvel in the 1980s and served as the regular writer of both The Spectacular Spider-Man and Web of Spider-Man from 1988 until 1990. Conway stated in 1991 that \\"I understand the character a lot better now than I did when I was nineteen.

Conway's last recorded comic credits for many years were Topps Comics' \\"Kirbyverse\\" NightGliderSources disagree on the spelling, sometimes even within the same source: The cover of the single issue itself appears to spell it \\"NightGlider\\". The cover of Victory #1 likewise spells it as one word, though in an all-caps typeface. The Grand Comics Database entry spells it as both \\"Nightglider\\" and \\"Night Glider\\". #1 (April 1993), scripting from a Roy Thomas plot, and a story for Disney Adventures, published in 1995.

He published several works, a treatise on linear algebra [Sou64a], a treatise on relativity [Sou64b] and a treatise on symplectic mechanics [Sou70]. He developed the symplectic aspects of classical and quantum mechanics. He contributed to the introduction or the development of many important concepts, such as the coadjoint action and the coadjoint orbits of a group on its moment space, which led in particular to the first geometric interpretation of spin at a classical level. He introduced the moment map, he suggested a program of geometric quantization, he gave a classification of the homogeneous symplectic manifolds, known as the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau theorem. Finally, he proposed a new approach to differential geometry by means of diffeologies. He was educated at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, and spent most of his career as a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Provence in Marseille. Bibliography *[Sou64a] J.-M.

The movement emerged in response to the Western Schism between rival popes in Rome and Avignon. The schism inspired the summoning of the Council of Pisa (1409), which failed to end the schism, and the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418), which succeeded and proclaimed its own superiority over the Pope. Conciliarism reached its apex with the Council of Basel (1431‚Äì1449), which ultimately fell apart. The eventual victor in the conflict was the institution of the Papacy, confirmed by the condemnation of conciliarism at the Fifth Lateran Council, 1512‚Äì17. The final gesture however, the doctrine of Papal Infallibility, was not promulgated until the First Vatican Council of 1870.  Background  The 13th and 14th centuries were a period of challenges to papal authority in Catholic Europe. These new challenges were marked by disputes between the Papacy and the secular kings of Europe. In particular the quarrel between Philip IV of France and Pope Boniface VIII over the right to tax the clergy in France was especially heated. Philip was excommunicated and Boniface was accused of corruption, sorcery, and sodomy. In his \\"Unam sanctam\\" (1302), Boniface asserted that the papacy held power over both the spiritual and temporal worlds and that only God could judge the pope. Philip responded by sending knights to Italy to arrest Boniface. Though the mission eventually failed, the Pope died just three weeks after his release because of the trauma of the experience and a high fever. This was followed by the move of the Roman papacy to Avignon, France in 1309, where it would remain until 1377. Although the move had precedent, the Avignon Papacy's image was damaged by accusations of corruption, favoritism toward the French, and even heresy. Indeed, Pope Clement VI who was criticized for his apparent extravagant lifestyle asserted that his \\"predecessors did not know how to be Pope.\\" During the span of the Avignon Papacy all the popes and most Cardinals and curial officials were French. The reputation of the Avignon Papacy led many to question the absolute authority of the pope in governing the universal Catholic Church. The Western Schism (1378‚Äì1417), was a dispute between the legal elections of Pope Urban VI in Rome and Pope Clement VII in Avignon. The schism became highly politicized as the kings of Europe chose to support whichever pope served their best interests. Both popes chose successors and thus the schism continued even after Urban and Clement's deaths. In this crisis, conciliarism took center stage as the best option for deciding which pope would step down. The cardinals decided to convene the Council of Pisa (1409) to decide who would be the one pope of the Catholic Church. The council was a failure and even led to the election of a third pope. The Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418) successfully ended the Schism by deposing two Popes (John XXIII and Benedict XIII) ‚Äì the third Pope abdicated ‚Äì and electing a successor in Martin V. The Council also decreed to maintain the council as the primary church body from then on, though Martin did not ratify this decision. The papal curia's apparent inability to implement church reform resulted in the radicalisation of conciliarism at the Council of Basel (1431‚Äì1449), which at first found great support in Europe but in the end fell apart. Parts sided with the Pope to form the Council of Florence, whereas the conciliar party in Basel elected another antipope before eventually losing its support among European governments. At the convening of the Fifth Lateran Council (1512‚Äì1517), Pope Julius II reasserted the supremacy of papal authority over that of the councils. Populated by cardinals opposed to conciliarism, the Lateran Council condemned the authority of conciliary bodies. In fact, the council was an essential copy of the pre-Conciliar councils such as Lateran IV (1215), Lyon (1274),  Conciliar theory  William of Ockham (d. 1349) wrote some of the earliest documents outlining the basic understanding of conciliarism. His goal in these writings was removal of Pope John XXII, who had revoked a decree favoring ideas of the Spiritual Franciscans about Christ and the apostles owning nothing individually or in common. Some of his arguments include that the election by the faithful, or their representatives, confers the position of pope and further limits the papal authority. The universal church is a congregation of the faithful, not the Catholic Church, which was promised to the Apostles by Jesus. While the universal Church cannot fall into heresy, it is known that the Pope has fallen into heresy in the past. Should the pope fall into heresy a council can be convened without his permission to judge him. William even stated that because it is a \\"universal\\" church, that the councils should include the participation of lay men and even women. In his Defensor Pacis (1324), Marsilius of Padua agreed with William of Ockham that the universal Church is a church of the faithful, not the priests. Marsilius focused on the idea that the inequality of the priesthood has no divine basis and that Jesus, not the pope, is the only head of the Catholic Church. Contradicting the idea of Papal infallibility, Marsilius claimed that only the universal church is infallible, not the pope. Marsilius differed from Ockham in his denial to the clergy of coercive power. Later conciliar theorists like Jacques Almain rejected Marsilius's argument to that effect, preferring more traditional clericalism modified to be more constitutional and democratic in emphasis. Conciliar theory has its roots and foundations in both history and theology, arguing that many of the most important decisions of the Catholic Church have been made through conciliar means, beginning with the First Council of Nicaea (325). Conciliarism also drew on corporate theories of the church, which allowed the head to be restrained or judged by the members when his actions threatened the welfare of the whole ecclesial body. The canonists and theologians who advocated conciliar superiority drew on the same sources used by Marsilius and Ockham, but they used them in a more conservative way. They wanted to unify, defend and reform the institution under clerical control, not advance a Franciscan or a lay agenda. Among the theorists of this more clerical conciliarism were Jean Gerson, Pierre d'Ailly and Francesco Zabarella. Nicholas of Cusa synthesized this strain of conciliarism, balancing hierarchy with consent and representation of the faithful. John Kilcullen wrote, in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, that \\"in France conciliarism was one of the sources of Gallicanism.\\"  Opposition to conciliarism  Many members of the Church however, continued to believe that the pope, as the successor of Saint Peter, retained the supreme governing authority in the Church. Juan de Torquemada defended papal supremacy in his Summa de ecclesia, completed ca. 1453. A generation later, Thomas Cajetan vigorously defended Papal authority in his \\"On the comparison of the authority of pope and council\\". He wrote that \\"Peter alone had the vicariate of Jesus Christ and only he received the power of jurisdiction immediately from Christ in an ordinary way, so that the others (the Apostles) were to receive it from him in the ordinary course of the law and were subject to him,\\" and that \\"it must be demonstrated that Christ gave the plenitude of ecclesiastical power not to the community of the Church but to a single person in it.\\" Both writers represent the many cardinals, canon lawyers and theologians who opposed the conciliar movement and supported the supremacy of Peter's successors. Conciliarism did not disappear in the face of these polemics. It survived to endorse the Council of Trent which launched the Catholic Counter-Reformation in the 1540s and later appeared in the anti-curial polemics of Gallicanism, Josephinism and Febronianism.  Modern conciliarism  Although conciliarist strains of thought remain within the Church, particularly in the United States, Rome and the teaching of the Catholic Church maintains that the Pope is the Vicar of Christ on earth, and has the authority to issue infallible statements. This Papal Infallibility was invoked in Pope Pius IX's 1854 definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, and Pope Pius XII's 1950 definition of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary. The teaching of the Second Vatican Council on the College of Bishops contained within the decree Lumen gentium has sometimes been interpreted as conciliarism, or at least conducive to it, by liberal and conservative Catholics alike; however, the text of the document as well as an explanatory note (Nota Praevia) by Paul VI makes the distinction clear. There are Christians, especially of the Anglo- Catholic, Old Catholic and Eastern Orthodox communions, who maintain the absolute supremacy of an ecumenical council. See conciliarity; however, this belief, from the Orthodox view, has no historical connection with the above events in the history of the Western Church. A new interest in conciliarism was awakened in Catholic Church circles with the convocation of the Second Vatican Council. The theologian, Hans K√ºng, and the historian, Francis Christopher Oakley, have argued that the decrees of the Council of Constance remain valid, limiting papal power.

DC later collected Pasko and Giffen's stories into a three-issue limited series titled The Immortal Dr. Fate (Jan. 1985 ‚Äì March 1985).

Giffen plotted and was breakdown artist for an Aquaman limited series and one-shot special in 1989 with writer Robert Loren Fleming and artist Curt Swan for DC Comics. He has worked on titles owned by several different companies including Woodgod, All Star Comics, Drax the Destroyer, Heckler, Nick Fury's Howling Commandos, Reign of the Zodiac, Suicide Squad, Trencher, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, and Vext. He was responsible for the English adaptation of the Battle Royale and Ikki Tousen manga, as well as creating \\"I Luv Halloween\\" for Tokyopop. He worked for Dark Horse from 1994 to 1995 on their Comics Greatest World/Dark Horse Heroes line, as the writer of two short lived series, Division 13 and co-author, with Lovern Kindzierski, of Agents of Law. For Valiant Comics, Giffen wrote X-O Manowar, Magnus, Robot Fighter, Punx and the final issue of Solar, Man of the Atom. He took a break from the comic industry for several years, working on storyboards for television and film, including shows such as The Real Ghostbusters and Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy. Giffen and his Justice League colleagues, J.M. DeMatteis and Kevin Maguire, have applied their humorous brand of storytelling to a title that he had drawn in the 1970s, Marvel Comics' The Defenders. Giffen later confessed concerning his 1970s run, \\"Back then, I was the kind of moron that I now warn new guys against becoming. ... When I think of Defenders, I think of what could have been if I'd had an ounce of professionalism in my body at that time.\\" The Giffen/DeMatteis/Maguire trio also produced the Metal Men backup feature which appeared in Doom Patrol. Giffen and DeMatteis collaborated with artist Joe Abraham on the creator-owned title Hero Squared for Boom! Studios. The two-issue mini-series Planetary Brigade chronicled the adventures of characters originating from this series. Giffen was the breakdown artist on the DC Comics title 52, a weekly series following in the wake of the Infinite Crisis crossover, written by Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid and Grant Morrison.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 325: \\"The title was masterminded by writers Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, and Mark Waid, with Keith Giffen providing art breakdowns.\\" He continued in that role with the follow-up weekly series Countdown to Final Crisis. He was the lead writer for Marvel Comics's \\"Annihilation\\" event, having written the one-shot prologue, the lead-in stories in Thanos and Drax, the Silver Surfer as well as the main six issue mini-series. He wrote the Star-Lord mini-series for the follow-up story Annihilation: Conquest. Between 2005 and 2007 he co-created and often authored or co-authored independent comics such as 10, Tag and Hero Squared for Boom! Studios for Zapt! and I Luv Halloween for Tokyopop, Common Foe and Tabula Rasa for Desperado Publishing/Image Comics and Grunts for Arcana. Many of these were co-authored with Shannon Denton. He co-wrote OMAC with Dan DiDio as part of The New 52 company-wide relaunch until its cancellation with issue #8. In October 2011, he became writer of Green Arrow from issues #4‚Äì6. Giffen and Paul Levitz collaborated on the Legion of Super-Heroes for issues #17 and 18 in 2013. Giffen reunited with J. M. DeMatteis on the Justice League 3000 series launched in October 2013.Manning \\"2010s\\" in Dougall, p. 341: \\"The future reality of the Legion of Super-Heroes was explored by writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis and artist Howard Porter.\\" In 2014, he and Jeff Lemire, Dan Jurgens, and Brian Azzarello co-wrote The New 52: Futures End. That same year, Giffen and Dan DiDio reunited on Infinity Man and the Forever People. Artwork Giffen's art has taken on many styles over the years. His early work tended towards a heavy influence from Jack Kirby. After an early stint at Marvel, he began doing layouts for artist Wally Wood during the 1976 revival of the Justice Society of America in All Star Comics. When he returned to comics after a hiatus, his style was more precise and reminiscent of George P√©rez and Jim Starlin, and helped make Legion of Super-Heroes DC's second most popular comic after P√©rez's New Teen Titans. It was his work on the Legion that rocketed him to comic book artist fame and gave him a creative control with the national companies that few artists achieved. He peppered his artwork with in-jokes such as upside down Superman logos, hidden Marvel characters, eyeball creatures, and scrawled humorous messages on signs in the background of his panels in the alternate futuristic alphabet Interlac. As Giffen's style loosened up, he found himself drawn to the work of Jos√© Mu√±oz (see Controversy). Soon thereafter he developed a scratchier, more impressionistic style, using a highly stylized method of drawing directly with ink, on titles such as Trencher, Lobo Infanticide and Images Of Shadowhawk. After his lengthy sabbatical from comics work, Giffen returned with a style influenced by his Justice League artist Kevin Maguire that was midway between the tight, controlled pencils of his early Legion days and the freer but less anatomically realistic style he had later adopted. Writing For many years, Giffen co-wrote comics, but only as a plotter. He relied on others such as Robert Loren Fleming and Tom and Mary Bierbaum to supply dialogue, even when he was basically the author of the work. He co-wrote the Freak Force series with Erik Larsen and co-wrote two SuperPatriot mini-series. Beginning with Trencher, Giffen started writing comics fully by himself, although he still collaborates when the project calls for it. Giffen is known for having an unorthodox writing style, often using characters in ways not seen before . His dialogue is usually characterized by a biting wit that is seen as much less zany than dialogue provided by longtime collaborators DeMatteis and Robert Loren Fleming . He is known for his humorous takes on existing characters, often focusing on their personality clashes . He has a tendency to poke fun at trends in comic books or character archetypes. His Ambush Bug miniseries is especially noted for its in-jokes such as Villian the Villain, Cheeks the Toy Wonder, and the use of DC editor Julius Schwartz as a character. He is known for sudden plot twists and abrupt often tragic turns of fate. During his late 1980s-early 1990s run on the Legion of Super-Heroes, light comical issues were often followed by darker ones where popular characters were maimed or killed. Work since 2007 includes writing The Programme #3, Dreamwar a DC/Wildstorm crossover and Reign in Hell, an eight-issue limited series, with artists Tom Derenick and Bill Sienkiewicz, about various DC Comics magical characters in Hell.Cowsill \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 334: \\"DC's version of Hell erupted into all- out war when the rulers of Purgatory, Blaze and Satanus invaded Neron's infernal domain. Written by Keith Giffen with art by Tom Derenick and Bill Sienkiewicz.\\" On February 7, 2009, it was announced at the New York Comic Con that he would be spearheading a revival of Doom Patrol, a title which he has long said he wanted to write. He finished Grant Morrison's run on The Authority and writing a Magog ongoing series. Giffen co-wrote the 26-issue biweekly Justice League: Generation Lost with Judd Winick, which saw the return of Justice League International, and wrote an arc of Booster Gold with DeMatteis and artist Chris Batista. In 2011 and 2012, he co-wrote and drew OMAC with Dan DiDio for eight issues before its cancellation. DC announced in October 2011 that Giffen would be co-writing Superman vol. 3 with Dan Jurgens and their first issue was #7 (cover dated May 2012). Controversy In February 1986 writer Mark Burbey published \\"The Trouble with Keith Giffen\\" in The Comics Journal, an examination of then-recent dramatic changes in Giffen's drawing style. The article pointed out that Giffen had changed from a slick, clean Jim Starlin-esque style to an avant garde, heavily inked one. The article displayed several panels side-by-side to illustrate the magazine's allegation that Giffen was copying, or \\"swiping\\" the work of Argentinian cartoonist Jos√© Antonio Mu√±oz.Burbey, Mark. \\"The Trouble With Keith Giffen,\\" The Comics Journal #105 (February 1986), pp. 9‚Äì14.\\"The Official Keith Giffen Swipe List,\\" The Comics Journal #105 (February 1986), p. 15. Giffen alluded to the controversy by drawing Ambush Bug with the Peanuts character Snoopy in Son of Ambush Bug #5 (Nov. 1986). Giffen's frequent collaborator Robert Loren Fleming wrote the dialogue for the scene. The controversy continued, however, when Giffen was accused of swiping Mu√±oz again in a 1988 story in the anthology Taboo.\\"More Giffen Swipes in Taboo,\\" The Comics Journal #125 (October 1988), pp. 20‚Äì21. At that point in his career, Giffen was one of the most popular comic book artists in the industry. The ensuing controversy hurt Giffen's reputation. Giffen returned to drawing full-time two years later while continuing to plot the Justice League and its numerous spin-offs. This period also marked Ambush Bug's demise as a popular major character at DC. According to Giffen, however, this change had more to do with editorial discomfort with the series' humorous approach to the DC Universe: \\"DC was just too uncomfortable with the (admittedly nicely selling) bully pulpit they'd provided the loose cannons on the creative team\\". Giffen has acknowledged Mu√±oz's influence, and in 2000 referred to the controversy this way: Awards Keith Giffen received an Inkpot Award in 1991. Bibliography As artist unless otherwise noted.
