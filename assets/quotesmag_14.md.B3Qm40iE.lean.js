The mission was founded in 1886 by the Jesuits who were welcomed by Bishop Martin Marty, and it soon grew to a large collection of buildings. Most of these were destroyed by a fire in 1916, but many were soon rebuilt. The mission complex includes 26 buildings, the most prominent of which are St. Charles Borromeo Church and the 1916 Drexall Hall, the latter a multifunction structure providing classrooms, meeting spaces, and residential spaces. The complex also includes one of two known copies of a statue of Kateri Tekakwitha by Joseph-Émile Brunet. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History The Jesuit presence in this area goes back to the 1840s when Fr. Peter DeSmet, S.J., was welcomed by the plains Indians and had contacts with the Lakota. Based on his reputation as a man who could be trusted, and on the Jesuit reputation as educators, in 1877 Chief Sinte Gleska (Spotted Tail), leader of the Sicangu Lakota, and Chief Red Cloud, leader of the Oglala, obtained permission from President Rutherford B. Hayes \\"to get Catholic priests. Those who wear black dresses. These men will teach us how to read and write English.\\" This led to the arrival of a Jesuit Father and brother soon after 1881 and, with financial help from St. Katherine Drexel, the completion of a large building in 1886. In 1888 Franciscan Sisters Kostka, Rosalia, and Alcantara came to teach in the school which they named after St. Francis. Jesuit Fr. Florentine Digmann who had come with the sisters went on to establish 37 mission stations on the Rosebud Reservation. Since 1974 the school, locally called Sapa Un Ti (\\"where the Black Robes live\\"), has been run by the tribe, independently from the Jesuit mission. The many chapels have been replaced by six parishes on the reservation. Current programs In 2016 three Jesuit priests along with Jesuit Volunteer Corps members were serving the Mission, with assistance from Lakota – a deacon, several commissioned lay ministers, and numerous volunteers – working among the 20,000 who remain on the reservation. The Mission supports high school equivalency (GED) and adult education, Icimani Ya Waste Recovery Center, the White River Recovery Center, the CYO Religious Education Center in Rosebud, and the Wiwila Wakpala after-school center in Spring Creek, along with the following works at the Center: *Sapa Un Catholic Academy, based on the Jesuit Nativity model of schools, began in 2013 teaching both English and Lakota to 10-12 students a year in grades K through 5. The express purpose of the school is to enable more Lakota to graduate from colleges and universities and become leaders among their people. Open to students of all religions, its tuition is low and it offers scholarships. Cultural enhancement opportunities include a month-long summer camp. *Lakota Studies is an effort to preserve the Lakota language and cultural heritage, with a view especially to its spiritual richness. In pursuit of this purpose Deacon Ben Black Bear, Jr., is translating the New Testament into Lakota, along with prayers and catechism instructions. In 2008 the program produced a new, more complete Lakota dictionary. *Family Recovery program, funded by the Betty Ford Institute, addresses the family dynamics behind addiction problems, in a 12-hour program that would facilitate recovery in the context of the whole family situation. The program is conducted by a trained staff in a different community on the reservation each month. Many have gone on to participate in other Mission programs such as Al-Anon and Alcoholics Anonymous. *Suicide prevention: In a single year beginning in October 2007, over 1% of the 20,000 on the reservation attempted suicide and 27 succeeded, compared to a national rate of 11.26 suicides. In hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, more leadership activities were called for to address the problem, warranting an emphasis on the mission's Academy program.

Its church building at 400 Main Street was built in 1891 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Since July 2014, St. Peter's is pastorally linked with the parishes of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta in Dakota Dunes and St. Joseph's in Elk Point in the Yankton deanery, part of a sweeping reorganization of the diocese. History The town of Jefferson was settled in 1859, predominantly by French Canadians. Catholic services were held occasionally before the arrival of the first permanent priest, Father Pierre Boucher, in 1867. A small log building to the north of the present church had been used as a schoolhouse and chapel since 1862. Father Boucher was responsible for a pastorate which extended across the Southeastern Dakota Territory, centered on the 25 French-Canadian families in Jefferson. The adjacent churchyard contains a large wooden cross, the replacement for a rude cross erected in May, 1876, when Father Boucher led an eleven-mile pilgrimage, ending in the churchyard at Jefferson, invoking divine aid against the besetting grasshopper plague. Father Boucher died in 1900 in Quebec. Soon after the arrival of Father Boucher, a large wooden church was built and served until 1890, when the current church was erected, during the pastorate of Father Cyrille St. Pierre. In 1889 a school and convent were built and these were replaced by the present parochial school building in 1951. The Rev. Charles F. Robinson was the pastor from 1894 until 1924 and he is buried in churchyard.

International comparisons The CM-501G missile has been said by many Chinese internet sources as the Chinese equivalent of the American NLOS-LS Netfires missile or the Israeli JUMPER missile, but the Chinese missile is much larger than the two western counterparts: in comparison to the 50 to 60 kg range of western missiles, CM-501G weighs around 150 kg, almost three times the weight of Netfires or JUMPER missiles. The 70 km+ range of the CM-501G is equal to that of the Netfires missile, and is longer than the 50 km range of the JUMPER missile, and the warhead of CM-501G is around 40 kg. Guidance options CM-501G also has more guidance options such as Satellite/INS, imaging infrared (IIR), semi- active laser homing (SAL) and in-flight updates for re-targeting if needed. The developer has claimed that the open architecture and modular design concept made the CM-501G system versatile enough to meet different financial constraints customers face by selecting different guidance systems: when budgetary constraints limit the funding, the two way data link and IIR can be replaced by cheaper SAL, and satellite guidance can be any of GPS, GLONASS, or BeiDou.CM-501G guidance Launch and command vehicles The basic CM-501G system consists of two vehicles both based on a Shaanxi Automobile Group SX2190 6 x 6 cross country heavy duty truck. For the launching vehicle, two launcher/containers each consisting of 9 missiles in 3 x 3 arrangement are mounted in the rear, totaling 18. This is more than the 15 of Netfires but less than the 24 of JUMPER. The command vehicle can use other chassis, such as Chinese HUMVEE. When a human operator is in the loop for re-targeting after receiving the update via two-way data link, this task is completed in the command vehicle. One of the improvement programs of CM-501G is to have the command vehicle integrated with the launching vehicle, so all tasks could be in a single vehicle. Another improvement program currently underway is the addition of re-targeting capability by forward observers. Variant=CM-501GCM-501GA= CM-501GA is a lighter version, with range reduced to 40km. =CM-502= With a range of 25 km. =CM-502KG= At the 9th Zhuhai Airshow held in November 2012, the light air-to-surface missile of CM series designated as CM-502 kg made public debut. CM-502 kg has an 11-kg warhead similar in size with that of AR-1, but its maximum range is more than twice that of AR-1, up to 25 km. The compact size of CM-502 kg enable it to be carried by both the manned aircraft and heavy unmanned aircraft (though mostly the latter), while the lighter AR-1 is carried by smaller unmanned aircraft, as the staff of developer have claimed at the show. There are unconfirmed said by Chinese military enthusiasts on the internet that CM-502 kg is conceptually designed in the same class as Spike NLOS.

He was in his youth a contributor in Cahiers universitaires, the magazine of the Federation of Nationalist Students. He co- founded the Nouvelle Droite think tank GRECE in 1968, serving as its secretary general from 1978 to 1984. Vial promoted a neopagan stance in the vein of Marc \\"Saint-Loup\\" Augier. Vial joined the Front National (FN) in 1988. The same year, he obtained a teaching position at Jean Moulin University Lyon 3. He soon reached the leadership ranks of the FN, serving as a member of the Institute of Formation of the party. However, Vial complained in both GRECE and the FN of a lack of focus on the ethnic dimension of identity, and he eventually decided to establish his own movement Terre et Peuple in 1994, launched publicly in 1995. In a public declaration delivered at a Terre et Peuple meeting in May 2000, Vial lamented the \\"ethnic colonization\\" of France by non-European immigrant communities with a different \\"biological infrastructure\\".

Its publicly stated aims were non- political but it became an incubator for the growing Arab Nationalist movement. The 1908 Committee of Union and Progress, Young Turk, revolution promised to implement political reforms and the establishment of a constitutional government across the Ottoman Empire. The revolution was greeted with approval across the Arab world amongst those who hoped for more recognition of the Arabic language and Arabic culture. In practice the new regime sought to increase central control from Constantinople and to impose Ottoman Turkish as the language of government across the empire. In 1909 a group of Arab politicians and intellectuals opened a club house in Constantinople with meeting rooms, a library and a hostel. They called it al- Muntada al-Adabi - the Literary Club. Initially, since it had no political agenda it was accepted by the CUP authorities. It was an immediate success, swiftly reaching a membership of several thousand, mostly students, with branches in Syria and Iraq. Following the outbreak of the First World War the organisation came under suspicion of involvement in anti-Ottoman activities.

Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124 (1995), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that when an action has been removed from state court to a United States Bankruptcy Court, and the bankruptcy court remands to state court because of a timely-raised defect in removal procedure or lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, the removal statute precludes a United States Court of Appeals from reviewing the order..  Facts  Two corporations were parties to a litigation in an Ohio state court. The defendant filed a bankruptcy petition and sought to remove (transfer) the case to the federal Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court accepted the removal, but on appeal, the District Court reversed, holding that the removal petition had been filed after the statutory deadline. The debtor filed a further appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but that court held that it lacked jurisdiction, because the removal statute barred the Court of Appeals from hearing appeals of remand orders. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the dismissal.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Clarence Thomas authored the opinion of a unanimous Court, which affirmed the Sixth Circuit's decision. He began by observing that \\"Congress has placed broad restrictions on the power of federal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court.\\" In 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d),. Congress provided that orders remanding civil cases to state court are not reviewable on appeal. Although the Court's decision in Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer created an exception to this rule where the remand order was based on a ground not recognized by the removal statute, the exception did not apply here. The fact that the removal in this case was based on the bankruptcy removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1452,. rather than the general removal statute did not change the result.  Concurring Opinions  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a short concurring opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, observing that the precise limits of the rule created in Thermtron were not before the Court in this case. Justice Ginsburg wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, suggesting that the phrase \\"on any equitable ground\\" should be read to mean simply any ground for remand that the Bankruptcy Court or District Court believed was fair. She concluded that both 28 U.S.C. §§ 1447(d) and 1452(b) barred the Court of Appeals from reviewing the District Court's remand order.

The work is in five movements: #Dialogo. Allegro #Scherzo-Pizzicato. Allegretto #Elegia. Lento #Marcia. Energico #Moto perpetuo. Presto History On 21 September 1960, a concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London introduced Britten to the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. The programme included the British premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto, performed by Rostropovich, alongside Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra. The two composers shared a ceremonial audience box. Shostakovich later confided to Rostropovich: After the performance, Rostropovich, already established as an obsessive commissioner of new works, pleaded with Britten to write him a piece for cello. The composer consented, and a year later produced the Cello Sonata, Op. 65. This became Britten's first of five major works written for Rostropovich over the course of the next decade – the others being the Cello Symphony and the three suites for solo cello. Britten's correspondence with Rostropovich reveals the composer's humility in the face of Rostropovich's reputation: he confesses \\"I may have made some mistakes\\" and quips that \\"the pizzicato movement will amuse you; I hope it is possible!\\"Reed, 278. In the scherzo-pizzicato, one can immediately detect an indebtedness, in its timbre and counterpoint, to the Balinese gamelan tradition.Mervyn Cooke, ed., The Cambridge Companion to Benjamin Britten (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 250.

On July 18, 2013 Hansjörg Auer, Matthias Auer and Simon Anthamatten made the first ascent over this wall,Hansjörg Auer, Kunyang Chhish East (7400m) – First Ascent via the Southwestface which had been widely regarded as one of the great remaining problems in alpinism.First Ascent of Kunyang Chhish East Climbing history Before the first ascent, there had been four known (legal) attempts at the summit of Khunyang Chhish East. =June 2003, Korean team= The first attempt to scale the peak took place in June 2003. A Korean expedition, however, gave up at 6100m feeling it was too difficult to continue the climb in a safe manner. Since their Camp 2 had been established near Ice Cake Peak, six out of ten members of the expedition (including Park Sung Man, Yen Yong Hum, Shim Yeong Keon, Jang ke Seob, Ko Jung Sig and Kim Man Kun) decided to ascend the summit of this 6,450m peak on the south ridge of Kunyang Chhish before returning to base camp. Ian Welsted, a Canadian climber in a gully during the 2006 expedition to Kunyang Chhish East. =July 2003, Polish team= Another attempt came in July 2003 by a Polish expedition consisting of Grzegorz Skorek (who died in 2004 returning from his climb of the 6995m north face of Khan Tengri), Janusz Golab and Stanislaw Piechuch. The first objective of the team was to acclimatize by climbing Ice Cake Peak, which they reached on August 5, 2003. Yet the team's main goal of climbing Khunyang Chhish East in alpine style was postponed until August 15 because of the weather conditions. After a period of heavy rain and snow the three decided to make their summit attempt. Due to continued unfavorable weather conditions, having made three bivouacs and reaching the height of 6700m the team retreated. =September 2006, American team= In September 2006 two Americans Steve House and Vince Anderson made their bid for the summit. Despite two weeks of attempts, House and Anderson didn't manage to complete their initial objective-acclimatizing climb of Ice Cake Peak, reaching only 5900 meters in continuing bad weather and high winds. The climb of the southwest face of Kunyang Chhish East began on September 10, 2003. Once again the summit was not reached, the climbers stopped 300m from the top. The climbers cited inadequate acclimatization, tiredness, cold winds as reasons for turning back.. =July 2006, Canadian/Polish team= Canadian/Polish climbers traversing the first ledge of Kunyang Chhish East, 2006. In 2006 a Canadian team including a Polish climber Raphael Slawinski (who had emigrated to Canada ()), Ben Firth, Eamonn Walsh and Ian Welsted made two attempts on the southwest face of Kunyang Chhish East. The quartet had first opted for an acclimatizing climb of the summit of the 6,450m Ice Cake, which they succeeded in reaching after two bivouacs. The first attempt at the summit of Kunyang Chhish East, up the southwest face of the mountain was on July 22. After reaching over 6,550m and two bivouacs, the combination of altitude and stomach problems of two members the climbers turned around, leaving some of their supplies hanging from the Polish anchor left by the previous expedition. The second attempt was scheduled for July 31. In the meantime the conditions on the southface had worsened with much of the snow melting and turning to bare ice. Another danger was rockfall and water cascading down the face as the afternoon warmed up. With increasing danger the Canadian climbers retreated from 5,900m on August 1, 2006. =First Ascent= Austrian Hansjörg Auer and Swiss Simon Anthamatten set up basecamp on June 12 and acclimatized, amongst others by climbing 6,400 m Ice Cake Peak. Due to a thumb injury, Hansjorg's brother Matthias could only join later and, for a lack of acclimatization, could not participate in the first two attempts on the 2,700 m southwest face between June 25 and 28 and on July 2. After a period of poor weather, all three started a final try on July 14. After spending two nights at camp 3 at 6700 m, the winds calmed down and the team reached the summit over a spectacular corniced ridge at 12:30 pm on July 18. This ascent was nominated as one of the five finalists for the 2014 Piolet d'Or.

Roughly the size and temperature of the Sun, PH2 gained prominence when it was known to be the host of one of 42 planet candidates detected by the Planet Hunters citizen science project in its second data release. The candidate orbiting around PH2, known as PH2 b, had been determined to have a spurious detection probability of only 0.08%, thus effectively confirming its existence as a planet. Located in its parent star's habitable zone, PH2 b (or Kepler-86b) is a \\"Jupiter-size\\" gas giant which may have a natural satellite suitable for hosting life. The report of the confirmed detection of PH2 b was submitted on January 3, 2013. It was discovered by amateur Pole Rafał Herszkowicz using his laptop and access to the Internet project with data from the Kepler space observatory. History of detection The Kepler search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy.PH2 b was detected, along with 42 other planet candidates, in archival data from Kepler by the Planet Hunters project, in which human volunteers analyze the light curves of Kepler target stars, searching for planetary transit signals which may be missed by computer programs. Previous work by Planet Hunters helped to confirm the existence of PH1 b, a Neptune-mass planet within a four-star system. All of the candidates in the second, including PH2 b, were identified by citizen scientists Abe J. Hoekstra, Thomas Lee Jacobs, Daryll LaCourse, Hans Martin Schwengler, Rafał Herszkowicz and Mike Chopin among others, with the help of Yale University astronomers. In addition to PH2 b itself, twenty other planet candidates were found which are located in the habitable zones of their host stars; however, these have a relatively high probability of spurious detection and may well come from non-planetary sources. Although the planet's initial detection was made using Kepler data, PH2's stellar spectra, required to rule out background stars or faint companions with planets as sources for the observed transits, were collected using the HIRES instrument at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Results of observations confirmed the existence of PH2 b with \\"99.9 percent confidence.\\" Planetary system PH2 is host to one confirmed planet, PH2 b, orbiting with a period of about 282 days, placing it and any possible moons in the habitable zone. The temperature in the upper atmosphere of the planet could range from to . A moon of PH2 b would likely have \\"a rocky core, plus a greenhouse atmosphere of some sort that could have liquid water on its surface\\" in the words of the researchers, thus further improving its prospects for habitability.

History  When officially launched on 11 January 2013, the European Cybercrime Centre was not expected to be fully operational until 2015. It began with a staff of 30, with plans to expand to 40 by the end of 2013. It began operations with a budget of about 3.6 million euros.  Organisational structure and key personnel  The head of EC3 reports directly to the head of Europol. The first person to head the department was the former head of Danish domestic intelligence, , who left Interpol in January 2015 to become Barclays' Chief Intelligence Security Officer..  Responsibilities and cooperation with other bodies  EC3 was tasked with assisting member states in their efforts to dismantle and disrupt cybercrime networks and developing tools and providing training. EC3 works with the European Union Intelligence and Situation Centre (INTCEN), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDCP), the World Customs Organization (WCO), the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCG, also known as Frontex), and the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF). Press releases in 2015 also revealed that EC3 works with American security services, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). There is some overlap with the responsibilities of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). At a press conference on 10 February 2014, asked about massive identity theft uncovered by the German Federal Office for Information Security, the then head of the EC3, Troels Oerting, said that his unit was not responsible for combatting \\"politically motivated hacking and/or espionage against EU institutions\\". = Activities = In February 2014, Troels Oerting reported successes that the unit had had in 2013.

This was unprecedented because it had never been given to a non- citizen. Being so well respected and appreciated by France, some years later, they bestowed another unprecedented honor in choosing him to be an officer (\\"Chevalier\\") of the Légion d'Honneur. For most of Dr. Lancaster's academic life, he was chair of the Romance Languages Department and professor of French literature at Johns Hopkins University. \\"A meticulous scholar and a mine of factual information,\\" he authored over ten books on French dramatic literature.Gerald Kamber, From the Ancients to the Moderns, Johns Hopkins Magazine, June 2008.

Dr. H. Carrington Lancaster was selected for a feature article and full-page photograph. Dr. Carrington Lancaster's papers are held at Johns Hopkins. Life Henry Carrington Lancaster was born in Richmond, Virginia, one of 13 siblings. He graduated with a B.A. within three years from the University of Virginia, then taught for a year at a southern private boys' school, before earning his PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 1907. He chose Amherst College for his first academic research and teaching appointment. One of his closest professor friends there introduced Carrington—a tall handsome bachelor—to his younger sister, Helen Converse Clark—beautiful smart and poetic. Carrington fell in love lifelong, as she with him. She was a student at Barnard College at the time, and daughter of the eminent U.S. economist Johns Bates Clark of Columbia University (advisor to three presidents, honored namesake of the nation's annual John Bates Clark Award in Economics). He married Helen Clark in 1913, and they made their first home in Amherst, where they were neighbors and close friends of Robert Frost. Their first two children, John Huntington Lancaster, and Helen Clark Lancaster were born in Amherst (Robert Frost awaiting Helen's birth with Carrington on his back porch). After moving to Baltimore In 1919—to succeed Edward C. Armstrong as professor at Johns Hopkins , Maria Dabney Lancaster and Henry C. Lancaster, Jr. were born. The family spent his sabbaticals in France. So beloved and respected was Carrington by his students, academic peers and friends, that they presented him with Adventures of a literary historian; a collection of his writings presented to H. Carrington Lancaster by his former students and other friends in anticipation of his sixtieth birthday, November 10, 1942. A very respected Baltimorean, Lancaster also wrote and spoke about Democratic causes. Originally Episcopalian, he became a Presbyterian church- goer with his family. They loved summer weeks at Rockywold-Deephaven Camps in Holderness, NH. Lancaster also enjoyed swimming, walking/hiking in nature, entertaining colleagues and friends, writing clever poems and limericks, and taking care of the family dog, Blarney.

It was co-written by Ian Goldberg and Andrew Chambliss, while being directed by David Solomon. Plot=Opening Sequence= The creature Yaoguai is featured in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= Belle (Emilie de Ravin) sits in a tavern and takes note of a group of men organizing an expedition to hunt a monster called the Yaoguai that terrorizes a distant kingdom. Dreamy (Lee Arenberg) arrives to thank her for the advice she gave him the previous night; he and Nova plan to run away together. He realizes that Belle yearns for adventure and is interested in the hunt for the Yaoguai. She insists she finds adventure enough in her books, but ultimately goes along with his suggestion that she join the hunters. Dreamy gives her a pouch of fairy dust. Belle reads a book, written in a foreign language (Chinese), as the hunting party travels in a wagon and the others—all men—mock her. After she tells them that the book identifies a lake as the Yaoguai's likely location, they abandon her in the road. However, she lied to them; mountains are the Yaoguai's preferred habitat, and she quickly locates its lair. But she is unable to sneak up on the creature's cave, and it emerges; it is a large quadruped with a mane of fire. Arrows are fired and the Yaoguai flees. Belle thanks her savior, who turns out to be a female warrior, Mulan (Jamie Chung), who is angry that Belle has spoiled the two weeks she spent tracking the Yaoguai. Belle explains that she found the creature much more quickly than that and offers to help find it again, but Mulan rejects the offer. Later, the hunters confront Belle over her lie and they assault her. Mulan appears and easily fights the men off. She tells Belle of how she learned to hold her own against disrespectful men when she served in her emperor's army. She acknowledges that Belle's tracking skills are superior to her own, and they agree to work together in the hunt for the Yaoguai so that Mulan can save her village. The original plan is for Mulan to fight the beast after Belle tracks it, however, Mulan was injured fighting the men and is now too weak. She asks Belle to confront the Yaoguai, encouraging her to find her \\"warrior spirit.\\" Belle is able to lure the Yaoguai into the village, where she uses a water tower to douse it. After the Yaoguai collapses to the ground, it uses its claw to write a message, \\"Save me.\\" Belle throws the fairy dust onto the Yaoguai, and it turns into Prince Phillip (Julian Morris). He explains that Maleficent cursed him by exiling him far from his kingdom in a monstrous form in order to keep him apart from his true love, Aurora. In thanks for saving him, Belle asks only that he help Mulan get the medical attention she needs. She takes Phillip to the woods and introduces him to Mulan, explaining what has happened. Belle then departs, planning to return to Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). She is taken prisoner by the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), her location having been betrayed by the men from the hunt (one of which had been shown to guard her jail cell). The Queen claims she is sparing Belle from the misery of trying and failing to reform Rumplestiltskin, but Belle defiantly shouts that she will never stop fighting for him. =In Storybrooke= Mr. Gold abducts William Smee (Chris Gauthier) and takes him to the edge of Storybrooke. There, he uses a potion on Smee's hat, knitted for him by his grandmother, and then pushes him across the town line. Smee retains his memory. Pleased, Gold releases him. Gold tells Belle of his success; if he uses the potion on his most treasured object and keeps the object with him, he can cross the border of Storybrooke without losing his identity or his knowledge of his quest to find his son, Baelfire. For the talisman, he will use a shawl that belonged to Baelfire. They agree that they would both like for Belle to accompany him, but there is only enough of the potion to enchant one object. A funeral is held for Dr. Archie Hopper (Raphael Sbarge). Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) eulogizes him, saying they will always think of him when they listen to their consciences. Hopper, actually alive and held prisoner by Captain Hook (Colin O'Donoghue), is interrogated by his captor. Hook is aggravated that Hopper knows nothing about the Dark One's dagger; he threatens Hopper with dissection and demands to know of Rumplestiltskin's other weaknesses. Hopper's response is not shown, but Hook soon attacks Belle at the library. She recognizes him from the Evil Queen's palace and, by pushing a bookshelf onto him, is able to hold him off long enough to seal herself securely inside the freight elevator. She calls Gold and he comes to rescue her. There is no sign of Hook. Leroy, speaking for the Seven Dwarves, asks when they will return to the Enchanted Forest. After Archie's death, they no longer feel safe, and despite their enjoyment of Storybrooke's modern conveniences, many of the townspeople are concerned that, with the end of the curse, anybody from the world beyond Storybrooke could enter town, learn of magic, and endanger them. They are also homesick. Gold and Belle head back to Gold's shop. Along the way, he reveals that Hook took his wife Milah from him, and that's why he took Hook's hand. He also reveals only that Milah died, but not how. They then find that the shop has been ransacked and the shawl stolen. Smee has taken it and gives it to Hook, because Hook wants to keep Gold trapped in Storybrooke. Gold plans to retrieve the shawl; blaming herself, Belle wants to help, but Gold insists that she instead lock herself safely in the library. He will not compel her magically; he trusts her to do as he asks and gives her a gun. Gold confronts Smee, who has packed a bag to leave town. Smee admits that he gave the shawl to Hook, and does not know where he is. Gold calls him a rat and turns him into one. In the library, Belle finds a piece of rope that Hook dropped; she quickly researches it, identifies it as nautical rigging, and realizes that Hook's ship is in Storybrooke. She goes to the dock and, keenly observing her surroundings, locates and boards the invisible ship. She finds Archie in the hold and frees him, sending him to bring Gold. She stays to search for the shawl, but finds only a treasure in coins before Hook returns and catches her. He quickly disarms her and turns the gun on her. He informs her that Milah left Rumplestiltskin for his cowardice and that he loved Milah; he cannot bring himself to destroy the shawl, because she made it. He also tells her that Rumplestiltskin killed Milah by taking and crushing her heart, but Belle declares that she still believes there is good in Rumplestiltskin. She knocks Hook over with a wooden beam and flees with the shawl, but his knowledge of the ship enables him to intercept her on the deck before she can escape. Gold then arrives and begins to savagely beat Hook with his cane. Belle begs Gold to take the shawl and leave with her, while Hook dares him to take his heart. Belle tells Gold that Hook only wants to destroy the good in him; he listens to her, and they leave together after Gold tells Hook he never wants to see him again. Meanwhile, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) has been despondent over Archie's death, even calling the doctor's office to hear his voice on the answering machine. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) then brings Archie's dog, Pongo, to Mary Margaret's apartment; Marco (Tony Amendola) felt Henry should have him. Mary Margaret is concerned the loft will be cramped, and she suggests she and David (Josh Dallas) find a new home of their own. But while Mary Margaret is content to establish a new life together in Storybrooke, David feels they need to liberate the Enchanted Forest from the ogres and from Cora; they realize that they may now want different things. Henry draws up plans to remodel the loft if his grandparents move out, and he wants to add an armory to protect them from Regina; Emma promises to keep him safe from her. Archie arrives and explains that he was kidnapped by Cora. Emma realizes that they were wrong about Regina, and she worries that there will be consequences for misjudging her. At the town line, Gold uses his potion on the shawl and steps outside of Storybrooke, retaining his memories. Belle promises to wait for his return, but then Hook appears and shoots her, causing her to fall beyond the town line. Having forever lost all memories of being Belle, she shouts at Gold, who laments that the erasure of Belle's identity cannot be undone. He prepares to assault Hook with a fireball, which he seems to welcome. Just then, a car horn sounds, and Gold dives out of the way with Belle. The car knocks over Hook, who collapses on the road. Gold stares as the car which has a Pennsylvania license plate. Production \\"The Outsider\\" was co-written by producers Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg, while Las Vegas veteran David Solomon directed the episode. Reception=Ratings= The episode took a major hit from a combination of factors (both the Golden Globe Awards and a delayed 60 Minutes due to the AFC playoffs running overtime into the 8PM Eastern time zone), resulting in its lowest numbers by far, placing 2.8/7 among 18-49s with only 8.15 million viewers tuning in.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Golden Globes' Up From Last Year, 'Once Upon a Time' Falls + 'Happy Endings', 'Revenge' & 'Don't Trust the B' Hit Lows\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2it (January 14, 2013) =Reviews= Entertainment Weekly critic Sarah Caldwell gave it a good but mixed review: \\"'I think we can all agree that this was a pretty stupendous episode  and I’m not just talking about Belle’s wardrobe.\\"\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: Fare Thee Belle\\" from Entertainment Weekly (January 13, 2013) Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it a B: \\"Once Upon A Time is a problematic series, but it’s not unfixable. The last two episodes back from winter hiatus have made big strides toward improving this show, largely by focusing on character development rather than mythology. While it’s fun to see how these Disney fairy tales intersect in the past, the fantasy elements can feel empty without a strong emotional core. “The Outsider” does a good job balancing those different aspects of the series, spotlighting Belle as she fights to help Rumpelstiltskin realize the good inside himself while teaming up with Mulan in the past to hunt a giant flaming dog. It’s a little silly but that’s the Once Upon A Time M.O., and ultimately the episode is a strong story about fighting for what you really believe in, even if that ends up getting you a bullet in the back.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 2) episodes ","title":"The Outsider (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"38219064","text":"Iulian Popa (born 20 July 1984) is a Romanian former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

She overcame an impoverished childhood in China and teenage years spent in a San Francisco brothel to become a respected leader in the Chinese immigrant community in Minneapolis. Early life and emigration Liang May Seen was born in southern China's Guangdong Province around 1871. In 1885, at the age of fourteen, her parents sold her to a man who promised that Liang would be marrying a wealthy Chinese American merchant. Instead he sold her to a brothel in San Francisco. At the brothel, Liang May Seen was forced to provide sexual services for businessmen, but she plotted her escape. She contacted the Presbyterian Mission Home for assistance. On July 21, 1889, she slipped away from a banquet and was picked up in a carriage sent by the Mission Home. Liang lived at the Mission Home for three years. Besides converting to Christianity and learning housekeeping skills, she took classes in English, Cantonese, and mathematics. In 1892, a Chinese businessman from Minneapolis, Woo Yee Sing, visited the mission looking for a wife. There he found Liang; they were married that summer and she moved with him to Minneapolis. Life in Minnesota Woo Yee Sing had immigrated to the United States at the age of eighteen, moving to San Francisco in the early 1880s. He arrived to face severe anti-Chinese violence. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act - which restricted Chinese immigration to the United States - had also bolstered the segregation and social exclusion of Chinese immigrants already in the United States. Most of the Chinese men who came to the Midwest during the 1880s and 1890s moved from the West Coast to escape this kind of violence. Woo Yee Sing moved for the same reason. Minnesota was not free from violence or discrimination, however. In 1912 a small bomb was set off near Woo's restaurant, and his son recalled being taunted and called racist names. Like many Chinese men at this time, Woo became a laundry operator. In 1883, Woo Yee Sing and his brother Woo Du Sing opened a restaurant. Canton Cafe, later known as John's Place, was the first Chinese restaurant in Minneapolis. When Liang joined Woo in Minneapolis, she was the first Chinese woman to live in Minnesota. She made friends quickly, however. Because of her time at the Mission Home, she was fluent in English and had experience with cross-cultural friendships. Many of the white women she befriended in Minneapolis were neighbors and patrons of the curio shop she opened in 1904. Others, such as suffragist Mabeth Hurd Paige, were friends through organizations like the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Liang May Seen and Woo Yee Sing were both very involved with the Westminster Presbyterian Church. The church and its Chinese Sunday School were important institutions for many Chinese immigrants in Minneapolis. Westminster began teaching English lessons to Chinese men in 1882, and Woo Yee Sing was one of their first students. Although Westminster did not begin teaching English to Chinese women until 1920, the church was one of few places where women - both white and Chinese - could take on leadership roles through their involvement with social and religious activities. Most other civic organizations did not accept Chinese Americans until the 1930s or 1940s. The Chinese community in Minneapolis began growing after 1900. As Minnesota's Chinese men achieved economic success, more of them were able to bring their wives and families from Guangdong Province. When Chinese women moved to Minneapolis, Liang was there to help them acclimate to their new country. One of these women, Minnie Wong, became lifelong friends with Liang. Wong's husband, Wong Gee, brought her to Minneapolis in the early 1900s. Liang May Seen and Minnie Wong were both from Kaiping, and they spoke the same dialect. They visited each other frequently, and together they taught Westminster's first English classes for women. In 1906, Liang May Seen and her husband expanded their family. They were never able to have biological children, but they adopted a young boy named Howard from San Francisco. Liang was also very close to her niece, Margaret Woo Chinn. Liang died in 1946. She lived long enough to see the 1943 end of immigration laws excluding the Chinese.

He was considered the leading concert agent of his time, and was said to be \\"the greatest raconteur in London, who wasted away his fortune\\". Biography Harold Holt was born in Kimberley, Northern Cape, South Africa on 3 November 1885. William D. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History. Retrieved 6 August 2015 His father was a Jewish diamond merchant. He trained as a lawyer, but never practised. In 1924 he went into partnership with Lionel Powell, who had taken over the firm created by Alfred Schulz-Curtius after the latter's death. (The firm had been founded in 1876 by Schulz-Curtius to promote Richard Wagner's music in England. He later took Lionel Powell into partnership.) Powell died suddenly in 1931, leaving Holt with a mountain of debts and a company to run. It is now known as Askonas Holt. The list of famous names Harold Holt managed was long. It included: Marian Anderson, Feodor Chaliapin, Ania Dorfmann, Amelita Galli- Curci, Beniamino Gigli, Dame Joan Hammond, Ida Haendel, Josef Hassid, Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Fritz Kreisler, Dora Labbette,Charles Reid, Thomas Beecham: An Independent Biography, 1961, p. 210 John McCormack, Dame Nellie Melba, the young Yehudi Menuhin (in his concerts with Sir Edward Elgar), Grace Moore, Vladimir de Pachmann, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Gregor Piatigorsky, Rosa Ponselle, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Paul Robeson, Richard Tauber, and Luisa Tetrazzini. He scrubbed Enrico Caruso from his list after he refused an offer of $36,000 for 10 appearances. Josef Hassid was said, while confined in a mental institution, to have drawn up a list of the people he would kill if ever he were freed, and Harold Holt was at the top of the list. Musicians would say, jokingly, that Hassid was not all that mad if he wanted to kill Harold Holt. However, Holt had made strong representations to Hassid's medical advisers that his genius was such that the world could not afford to lose him prematurely, and all must be done to cure him. In consultation with her father, Harold Holt adjusted Ida Haendel's birth year from 1928 to 1923 to make it appear she was five years older than she really was. This was done in order to circumvent Covent Garden's rule prohibiting anyone aged under 14 appearing on stage. The incorrect birth year of 1923 has since appeared in many reference works. He began the Celebrity Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. The creation of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, usually attributed to its first conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, was said to have been largely the initiative of Harold Holt. In 1947 he was the first President of the European Association of Artist Managers (AEAA). He died on 3 September 1953, aged 67.

Early life James Small was a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean and the Robertsons of Straloch. Born in Perthshire, Scotland, he was the son of Patrick Small of Leanoch and Magdalen Robertson of Straloch. Small's younger brother was Major-General John Small, later Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey. His older brother was Dr. Alexander Small, army surgeon and frequent correspondent of Benjamin Franklin. Small was also a first cousin of John Reid, the last Baron Reid in Perthshire, Scotland. Following the family military tradition, Small became an Ensign in Lord Loudoun's Regiment and was stationed at Finnart. After Culloden After the Battle of Culloden (1746), Kinloch Rannoch was in a desperate state. There were no roads, the people were starving and thievery was commonplace. Additionally, the soldiers dispatched to the area to hunt down the Jacobite survivors contributed to the general sense of lawlessness within the town. As punishment for supporting the Jacobite cause, many of the large Scottish landowners had to forfeit their estates back to The Crown. In turn, The Crown appointed property managers or factors to oversee the estates. In 1754 James Small was appointed factor of the forfeited Robertsons of Straun estates, near Kinloch Rannoch. As factor, Small provided for disbanded soldiers to become crofters. He gave advice for the building of roads and bridges, the planning of schools and the erection of churches. Working with Dugald Buchanan and his wife, schools were established for the teaching of spinning and weaving. Experienced masons, joiners and wheelwrights were brought in to teach the younger generation useful trades. A less successful effort of Small's was attempting to drain the marshy land surrounding Kinloch Rannoch with a series of drainage ditches, that became known as The Soldiers' Trenches, but overall Small's efforts brought stability and prosperity to the area. While still serving as factor in the Kinloch Rannoch area, James Small died on 21 August 1777, at Chorley, Lancashire. His gravestone, now inside St Laurence, Chorley Parish Churchyard, records that he died at Chorley while on a journey to Buxton. The church register states that he was buried at 7 o'clock in the morning on 23 August 1777.St Laurence, Chorley, Lancashire Burials 1769-1797, Page 16, Entry 20 Personal life On 1 January 1739, Small married Katharine Wilson, daughter of the town clerk of St. Andrews. The couple had three daughters that survived to adulthood. The husband of Small's daughter, Susan, was Charles Spalding. Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner by trade, was the improver of the diving bell. He died diving to the wreck of the Belgioso in Dublin Bay in a bell of his design. Small was the grandfather of Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet of New Brunswick and Canadian fur trader John MacDonald of Garth. He was the great- grandfather of Sir John Campbell, 2nd Baronet of New Brunswick. Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton is also a descendant of James Small, as well as Sheila Legge, the \\"Surrealist Phantom\\" from the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition.

Umar's Assurance Custody was considered one of the most important documents in the history of (Jerusalem) The significance of the Assurance is discussed by early Muslim historians such as al-Waqidi (c. 747–823), al-Baladhuri (d. 892), in addition to Ibn al-Athir (1160-1232/3) and Abu al-Fida’ (1273-1331). The text of the document is included, either abridged or as long text, in the works al-Ya'qubi (d. 897/8), Eutychius (877–940), al-Tabari (copied from Sayf ibn Umar (died betw. 786-809), al-Himyari, Mujir al-Din al-Hanbali, and Ibn al-Jawzi (c. 1116–1201). Opinions differ on the authenticity of the different versions of the Assurance. Many historians have questioned the authenticity of the Christian versions of this pact and argue that such documents were forged by Christian scribes to secure their possession of some religious sites. Some historians consider aspects of al-Tabari's version to be authentic. For instance, Moshe Gil while discussing al-Tabari's version points out that \\"the language of the covenant and its details appear authentic and reliable and in keeping with what is known of Jerusalem at the time.\\" Historical background By AD 637, Muslim armies began to appear in the vicinity of Jerusalem. In charge of Jerusalem was Patriarch Sophronius, a representative of the Byzantine government, as well as a leader in the Christian Church. Although numerous Muslim armies under the command of Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As began to surround the city, Sophronius accepted to surrender but he demanded that Umar come to accept the surrender himself. Having heard of such a condition, Umar ibn al-Khattab left Medina to Jerusalem. Umar's Assurance and historical books The covenant was mentioned in the history books in more than one formula and text, and it ranges from short and short texts such as the text of Al-Yaqoubi and the text of Ibn Al-Batriq and Ibn Al- Juri, or detailed as the text of Ibn Asaker, the text of Al-Tabari, the text of Al-Tabari Al-Maqdisi and the text of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. And he attributed it to a number of sources, and we added some of them, and it came in the Musnad of Ahmad. His son Abdullah narrated in his appendices on the Musnad, some conditions for the dhimmis he said: He told us not one of the scholars said:e covenant was mentioned in the history books in more than one formula and text, and it ranges from short and short texts such as the text of Al-Yaqoubi and the text of Ibn Al-Batriq and Ibn Al-Juri, or detailed as the text of Ibn Asaker, the text of Al-Tabari, the text of Al-Tabari Al-Maqdisi and the text of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.

This is the assurance of safety which the servant of God, ʿUmar, the Commander of the Faithful, has given to the people of Aelia. He has given them an assurance of safety for themselves, for their property, their churches, their crosses, the sick and healthy of the city and for all the rituals which belong to their religion. Their churches will not be inhabited by Muslims and will not be destroyed. Neither they, nor the land on which they stand, nor their cross, nor their property will be damaged. They will not be forcibly converted. And [as per the Christians’ request] Jews will not live in Aelia with them. The people of Jerusalem must pay the taxes like the people of other cities and must expel the Byzantines and the robbers. Those of the people of Jerusalem who want to leave with the Byzantines, take their property and abandon their churches and crosses will be safe until they reach their place of refuge. The villagers [who had taken refuge in the city at the time of the conquest] may remain in the city if they wish but must pay taxes like the citizens. Those who wish may go with the Byzantines and those who wish may return to their families. Nothing is to be taken from them before their harvest is reaped. If they pay their taxes according to their obligations, then the conditions laid out in this letter are under the covenant of God, are the responsibility of His Prophet, of the caliphs and of the faithful.

He was one of the most active soldiers in the 16th-century Spanish colonization of the Americas. Biography Alonso de Cáceres, the son of Gregorio and Maria Cáceres Retes, was born in the village of Alcántara in Cáceres, Spain in the late 15th century. He received military training and participated in military campaigns in Europe. As of 1530, he was acting as a captain under the command of Governor Pedro de Heredia in southern Panama and northern Colombia. He participated in the founding of the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias and subsequently was involved in campaigns on the Isthmus of Panama and on the Colombian frontier. =Colombia and Panama= During the conquering expedition of Pedro de Heredia from Cartagena to the interior of territories,The Pancenú and Fincenú were indigenous tribes who buried their dead with large quantities of gold. Cáceres was sent to forage after food shortages emerged in Cartagena. Cáceres's soldiers were near starvation, and ate large quantities of guama fruit, which caused them to become constipated. This type of foraging took place regularly as the area of Cartagena had very few plantation areas and many soldiers died of hunger. On October 21, 1534, de Heredia forces under Cáceres seized Acla and took prisoner Julian Gutiérre and his wife Isabel, who spoke both Spanish and the language of the local indigenous population in Urabá, and she served as an interpreter for the expedition. =Central America= In 1536 Cáceres left the Colombian-Panamanian region and moved into Central America under the command of Governor Francisco de Montejo, responsible for the conquest of Yucatan. In this exploratory mission, Cáceres was sent to the Honduran city of Gracias a Dios, which then served as a base for his explorations. People of the city distrusted him and would not allow him to stay, but the captain was not discouraged and continued his mission. On 8 December 1537 he founded the city of Comayagua, which became the first Spanish capital of the territory that is now Honduras. Lencas led by Lempira attacked and burned the settlement, escaping afterwards to the mountain. Lempira brought with him about 30,000 natives from all the tribes of the region, and prepared a large-scale revolt against the Spaniards. Cáceres sent two men to him under the pretense of peace negotiations, but they instead treacherously assassinated Lempira, whose death dissolved the alliance among the indigenous tribes. The rebellion was unsuccessful, and the Honduran territory was secured for the Spanish crown. =Peru= Cáceres reached Jauja, Peru in 1539. An expedition, together with a Captain Alonso Mercadillo, into the territory of the Chupacho was planned, but the risk was evaluated to be too great and the expedition was not mounted. Cáceres continued on missions in 1544, conquering the city of Cuzco. Learning that Gonzalo Pizarro was about to arrive, he fled and began living in Arequipa. There he joined Jerónimo de la Serna and both moved to . They planned to seize the two ships that Pizarro had purchased to transport artillery and use them to support their operations. Cáceres and Serna bribed sailors, weighed anchor and brought the ships to the port of Callao, making them available to viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela. The viceroy was imprisoned by the court. Pizarro occupied Lima and was recognized as Governor and Captain- General of Peru. He ordered Cáceres killed along with others who had taken his field-marshal Francisco de Carvajal prisoner. Some lost their lives at the hands of Pizarro, but Cáceres was granted a pardon by Pizarro through the mediation of some respectable persons. When Pedro de la Gasca arrived in Peru, many Spanish soldiers who had earlier sided with Gonzalo chose to support La Gasca, including Hernan Bravo de Laguna, who was subsequently arrested. Gonzalo sent him to Carvajal to be hanged, but had to pardon him once his sister Inés Bravo, wife of Nicolás de Rivera, asked for his life. For this reason, Cáceres, who took much interest in the life of Bravo, kissed Gonzalo on the cheek saying loudly: \\"O prince of the world! Damn all those who deny thee, even until death.\\" But once they left, they rejoined the royal forces. Official activities Cáceres was assigned posts in the administrations of the governments of cities where he lived. In Santa Marta in Colombia, he served as alderman. In the Yucatan he served as lieutenant for Francisco de Montejo and acted for him as office of head chief when he was called away. In Arequipa (Peru) he was appointed mayor and presumably ended his days there. Descendants In Lima he married native creole María de Solier y Valenzuela, with whom he had a son. His son, Diego de Cáceres, married María Mauricia de Ulloa y Angulo in 1581. They had a son, named José de Cáceres y Ulloa. Petronila de Cáceres and Solier, who first married Sebastián de Casalla in 1568 and Rodrigo de Esquivel y Zúñiga, whose offspring brought him the marquisate of San Lorenzo del Valleumbroso.

Search: Pallotta. http://hbr.org/search/pallotta/. Early life and education Pallotta was born in Malden, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, the oldest of four children. He attended Harvard University and graduated cum laude in 1983.Meghdadi. At the age of 19 Pallotta placed second in a field of twelve candidates and became the second youngest member ever elected to the school board in his hometown of Melrose, Massachusetts. He took office in January, 1981, the same day Proposition 2½ became effective, which limited property tax increases by Massachusetts municipalities to no more than 2.5% annually. Also at the age of 19 Pallotta became chair of the Harvard Hunger Action Committee, an undergraduate student organization that raised money for Oxfam America by hosting symbolic fasts that raised approximately $2,000 each twice annually. He was studying development economics at the time and became frustrated at the gap between the massive scale of the problem of world hunger and his committee's minuscule fundraising totals up against it. During Pallotta's first weekend at Harvard he participated in the human consciousness course called the Erhard Seminars Training, created by Werner Erhard. The training's emphasis on making a difference, goal-setting, and human understanding would play a major role later in the design of the multi-day event experiences Pallotta and his company created. In 1980, as chair of the Harvard Hunger Action Committee, Pallotta organized a speaking engagement for singer- songwriter John Denver (who had served on President Jimmy Carter’s Commission on World Hunger). At Denver's invitation, Pallotta attended the singer's Windstar Foundation Program for college students in Snowmass, Colorado the next summer. The program focused on issues of global sustainability. Pallotta and his 20 classmates slept in teepees in the Rockies, and were treated to a macrobiotic diet and lectures by the mathematician and philosopher Buckminster Fuller. During the summer before Pallotta's senior year at Harvard he heard about two cyclists crossing America to raise money for cancer research.Pallotta, Uncharitable, p. 189. It inspired him to create a cross- country bike ride for world hunger. He and his co-chair, Mark Takano (now a Congressman representing the 41st district in California) recruited 39 students to make the journey. During the summer of 1983 they traveled 4,256 miles along a primarily northern route over the course of 9 1/2 weeks from Seattle to Boston. They crossed the continental divide at 9,658 feet at Togwotee Pass in the Absaroka Mountains of the United States, between the towns of Dubois and Moran Junction, Wyoming. The event raised approximately $80,000 for Oxfam-America. Pallotta appeared on television and radio during the course of the ride, including an in-studio appearance with Bryant Gumbel on the Today show.Today Show, 1983. =Los Angeles= In 1985 Pallotta moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a singer and songwriter. He was auditioned by Clive Davis and had a single recorded by Edgar Winter and sang the national anthem at Anaheim Stadium for the Los Angeles Rams. During his time in Los Angeles he also met David Mixner, a leading civil rights activists, and went to work on Mixner's Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, envisioned as a 5,000-person march across America to promote nuclear disarmament. He also met and worked with Irving Warner, author of Bantam Books' The Art of Fundraising, who mentored him in the field of major gift fundraising. In 1992, after a serious bout of Hepatitis A which he believed was HIV at the time, Pallotta decided to seek counseling and entered a 12-step program known as SLAA (Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous) to deal with addictive behavioral patterns that he felt were undermining his potential.Pallotta, When Your Moment Comes. His first book, When Your Moment Comes, details these years in Pallotta's life. Events=AIDS rides= Pallotta was aware that there was “nothing big” for the average person to do about AIDS. It was the same feeling of frustration he had at Harvard looking at the gap between world hunger and the small fundraising events designed to address it.Pallotta, Uncharitable. In 1991, building on the 'power of the journey' as a metaphor, he conceived of a 600-mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, which combined his marketing, fundraising, mobilizing and motivating skills. Three years later, the movie Alive motivated him to realize his idea. He brought his plan for the event to the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center, which was looking for a new signature event. The Center put up an initial investment of $50,000 in risk capital, which was enough for the effort to survive until a sponsorship was secured from Tanqueray for an additional $110,000. 478 people participated in the first California AIDS Ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles, netting $1,013,000 – much more than expected.PallottaTeamWorks, \\"Record of Impact: Detailed Financials.\\"Social Enterprise Summit & World Forum Address. From 1995 to 1996 Pallotta expanded the AIDS Rides to include San Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago, the Twin Cities, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Raleigh, North Carolina. The model was new in that it was the first time a “thon” event came with a four-figure mandatory fundraising minimum, and was marketed on a large scale in major metropolitan media. Up until that time, “thon” events had welcomed people no matter how much or how little they raised. This was democratic, but not a powerful revenue model. They also used traditional grassroots marketing methods. Pallotta's combination of marketing these events to the masses, not just to cyclists, marketing them alongside the major consumer brands in full-page ads in major metropolitan papers and expanding the events nationwide, created an industry that had not existed before. In nine years the AIDS Rides netted, after all expenses, $108 million – more money, raised more quickly for these causes than any events in history. =Breast Cancer 3-Days= In 1998 Pallotta conceived the idea of a three-day, 75-mile walk for breast cancer. After scouting the route with three other staff, it was decided that 75 miles was too long, and the event was shortened to 60 miles and called the “Breast Cancer 3-Day.” In 1997 Pallotta brought the idea to Joanne Mazurki, the head of the Avon Cosmetics company's Breast Cancer Crusade. She brought it to Jim Preston, Avon's CEO, who signed off on the launch of the first event, which would take place in 1998 and travel from Santa Barbara to Malibu. The event was four times as successful as the first AIDS Ride, netting $4.2 million. With capital from Avon, the events were expanded to four cities in 1999, seven cities in 2000, nine cities in 2001 and thirteen cities in 2002. In five years the events netted $194 million in unrestricted dollars for the breast cancer community — more money raised more quickly for the breast cancer cause than any event in history. =Out of the Darkness suicide prevention events= In 1999, after studying the issue of suicide, Pallotta realized that mortality rates from suicide approached those of breast cancer in the United States, and that suicide attempts dwarfed breast cancer diagnoses. He created an event called “Out of the Darkness” — a 26-mile walk through the night designed to bring the issue of suicide into the light. The event put suicide prevention at the table with the mega-causes, netting $1.3 million in its first year. =Big Ride Across America= In 1997, Pallotta TeamWorks produced the largest cross-country bike ride in American history for the American Lung Association. 730 cyclists rode for six weeks from Seattle to Washington, D.C. =AIDS Vaccine Rides= In 1999, Pallotta made a personal guarantee in order to borrow $1.1 million to launch the AIDS Vaccine Rides which would provide unrestricted dollars for maverick research at the UCLA AIDS Institute, the Aaron Diamond center and the Emory Vaccine Center. In three years, the AIDS Vaccine Rides, conducted in Alaska, Montana, and across the Canada–US border from Montreal to Vermont, netted $8 million. The funds have allowed the UCLA AIDS Institute to leverage tens of millions of dollars in additional grants that have led to breakthroughs in potential microbial preventions for the transmission of HIV that would not have been possible without the unrestricted funding from the Vaccine Rides that launched the research. =Harvard Business School case study= In 2000, Harvard Business School did a case study on social enterprise on Pallotta's company, Pallotta TeamWorks, which continues to be taught. Pallotta TeamWorks Pallotta built his for-profit charitable company Pallotta TeamWorks in 1994. His company employed 400 full-time people in 16 U.S. offices and was raising $169 million annually by 2002. In total, the company raised $582 million from 1994 to 2002. The company charged a fixed production fee for its services. It did not do commission-based fundraising or get a \\"take\\" off of the top. One hundred percent of all donations went to lock boxes under the charities' exclusive control. The charities then reimbursed the company for its expenses on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Pallotta TeamWorks fees, in a hindsight calculation, amounted to 4.01%http://pallottateamworks.com/financial.php of funds raised. Pallotta was criticized for the large amounts of money Pallotta TeamWorks was making each year and the $394,500 salary he was receiving, described as \\"stratospheric\\" for the aid world.Kristoff. \\"The Sin of Doing Good Deeds\\". His annual salary ranged from $150,000 in 1994 to approximately $425,000 in 2002. Palotta commented that \\"We allow people to make huge profits doing any number of things that will hurt the poor, but we want to crucify anyone who wants to make money helping them\\". In 2002, the company moved into an innovative headquarters that it had outfitted, The Apostrophe. For years Pallotta TeamWorks was located in poor offices spaces in Hollywood. A new and completely empty 47,000 square-foot \\"tilt-up\\" warehouse was located in Atwater Village, Los Angeles. The company had a budget of $2 million and that was not enough budget to heat and air-condition the space, so a creative approach was required.PallottaTeamWorks, \\"About Apostrophe\\". Clive Wilkinson & Associates (CWA) were contracted to create an inspiring new headquarters on the tight budget. The design used raw exposed lumber, shipping containers, and tents. The building now houses the Los Feliz Charter School for the Arts.Los Feliz Arts, \\"homepage\\". =Shut-down of Pallotta Teamworks= In 2002, the company's events netted $81 million for charity after all expenses. This was an amount equal to half the annual giving of the Rockefeller Foundation. At the time the Breast Cancer 3-Day program was the company's largest fundraising event series. For five years the Avon Products Foundation had been the beneficiary of the events, which netted $194 million in unrestricted funds for the Foundation in just five years. In 2002, Avon informed Pallotta TeamWorks that it would no longer be associated with the company's events. Pallotta TeamWorks began negotiating with another charity to become the beneficiary of the events. During that period, Avon announced a nationwide series of multi-day breast cancer fundraising walks, each with a four-figure pledge minimum, in many of the same cities in which the 3-Days had been conducted and, in many cases, on very similar dates. As a result, the new charity with which Pallotta TeamWorks had been negotiating, fearing that the events would cannibalize one another, decided against partnering with Pallotta TeamWorks on the 3-Days. A few days after the news, on August 23, 2002, the company laid off its entire staff nationwide and closed the doors on its new headquarters. Ultimately, the Susan G. Komen Foundation hired an event company, which was founded by former Pallotta staff, and resuscitated the 3-Day Walks, continuing to produce them through 2017. Writing In 2012 Pallotta wrote, Charity Case: How the Nonprofit Community Can Stand Up for Itself and Really Change the World, which Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. called, “an Apollo program for American philanthropy and the nonprofit sector”.Kennedy endorsement in Pallotta, Charity Case, front cover. The book calls for the creation of a “Charity Defense Council” to act as a national leadership organization for the humanitarian sector in the United States. In 2008 Pallotta wrote, Uncharitable: How Restraints on Nonprofits Undermine Their Potential. It became the best-selling title in the history of Tufts University Press. The New York Times described it as seething \\"with indignation at public expectations that charities be prudent, nonprofit and saintly\\". The Stanford Social Innovation Review wrote that the book, \\"deserves to become the nonprofit sector’s new manifesto\\". Former U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate Gary Hart wrote that the book was, “nothing less than a revolutionary work\\".Hart endorsement in Pallotta, Uncharitable, front cover. Pallotta has given in excess of 150 speeches in 29 countries on the book as of December, 2012. In 2000, Pallotta wrote, When Your Moment Comes – a Guide to Fulfilling Your Dreams, for the Jodere Group. Current work Pallotta founded Advertising for Humanity in 2004 as Springboard. The company helps institutional funders and philanthropists grow their most promising grantees. In 2012 Pallotta founded the Charity Defense Council, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

Britt is considered as one of the Pacific Northwest's most celebrated photographers,Peter Britt, Frontier Photographer, The Oregon History Project as well as the \\"father of the grape industry\\" in Southern Oregon.Peter Britt, a Leading Figure Among Pioneers. First Photographer in this Section of the State And 'Father of the Grape Industry in Southern Oregon', Jacksonville Post, July 31, 1920, page 1 His photos of Crater Lake were instrumental in creation of the Crater Lake National Park in 1902.  Biography  When Peter Britt was born in the town of Obstalden in the Swiss canton of Glarus, his family farmed land that had been in the family for centuries. Earning a living there as an itinerant portrait artist was difficult, but Peter pursued this until 1845, when he immigrated to the United States with his father Jacob Kaspar Britt, his brother Kaspar, and Kaspar's family.Miller, Alan Clark. Peter Britt: Pioneer Photographer of the Siskiyous. MA thesis, Trinity College, 1972. They settled with other Swiss emigres in Highland, Illinois. Portrait artists of the time were faced with competition from daguerreotype photographers, so Britt studied this new technology with John H. Fitzgibbon in St. Louis. Although Britt apparently opened his own studio in Highland in 1847 and operated it for five years, however no records to support that claim were ever located. Perhaps gold fever, or just wanderlust, took Peter Britt from Illinois to Oregon in 1852, following the completion of his naturalization process.Peter Britt (1819-1905), The Oregon Encyclopedia Britt left Illinois with John Hug and two other Swiss men heading west on the Oregon Trail. Britt was elected captain of the wagon train, John was the wagon master, and the group made it to Grande Ronde Valley before the men insisted on no longer dealing with Britt's 300 pounds of photographic equipment. John Hug split the wagon train into two halves. At The Dalles, Oregon, John Hug and Britt chose an overland route to Portland, while the other two men chose the Columbia River route and arrived in Portland, Oregon, just 24 hours later. Finally, Britt, hearing news of the gold mining strike in Table Rock City (now Jacksonville, Oregon), left Portland alone for southern Oregon. According to Alan Clark Miller, he arrived to the gold-mining camp of Jacksonville with the two-wheeled cart, a yoke of oxen, a mule, and five dollars in his pocket.Richard H. Engeman. The Oregon Companion: An Historical Gazetteer of the Useful, the Curious, and the Arcane. Portland: Timber Press, 2009. Britt built a log cabin in Jacksonville in November 1852, on land where he lived for the rest of his life.Gold Miner, Mule Packer, Painter, Southern Oregon Historical Society This log cabin no longer exists, but Southern Oregon University archeologists have recently determined the site of the cabin. Peter Britt, self-portrait, 1860s Although Peter Britt brought his photographic equipment all the way from Illinois to Oregon for a photo studio, he first tried gold mining and mule packing in order to earn a living. Altogether, Britt was successful enough to send money back to his brother Kaspar in Illinois, build a frame house in 1854, give up the dangerous mule packing business in 1856 to concentrate on his photography business, and expand his home in 1859. According to Alan Clark Miller, Britt knew his future wife, Amalia Grob, in Switzerland, but her father would not allow them to marry because Peter Britt's occupation as an itinerant artist was too tenuous. Instead, Amalia married a relative, Kaspar Grob. Britt's brother Kaspar did marry Amalia's sister, though. When Mr. Grob died in 1861, Kaspar Britt contacted Peter. Miller states that Peter immediately sent Amalia funds to return to Switzerland if she wished, or to travel to Oregon and marry him. With her young son Jacob, Amalia traveled to New Orleans and around Cape Horn to San Francisco, then by steamer to Crescent City and finally by stage to the Applegate stop. Peter Britt met her there and they were married. Prior to Amalia's death in 1871, she and Peter had three children of their own, Emil, Arnold (who died as an infant) and Amalia Dorothea, known as Mollie. Emil, who also became a photographer, and Mollie remained in the Britt home their entire lives.Britt's Family, Southern Oregon Historical Society  Photography  Britt's first wet plate negative, 7 February 1858 In 1856, Britt decided to pursue photographic trade as the main line in business and opened a photography studio, P. Britt’s Photograph and Daguerreotype Room, in Jacksonville. Soon, he established himself in the southwestern Oregon and northern California area as a skillful professional, best known for his photo portraits. Among his subjects were local prominent citizens, farmers, miners, Chinese workers, and Native Americans.Carolyn Kingsnorth. Pioneer Profiles: Peter Britt. Photographer, Visionary, Entrepreneur, Jacksonville Review, May 30, 2014. Until 1858 Britt could take only daguerreotypes or ambrotypes, processes that provided only the photo, no negatives or extra prints. About 200 of his daguerreotypes survive. Britt's first wet plate negative was taken of a trapper who agreed to sit for Britt's experiment. In the 1860s Britt purchased a stereo camera, which led to his development as an outdoor photographer as well as a gallery photographer. At this point he set up the traveling studio he called The Pain, a pun on Bain Wagon Company, which manufactured his wagon. Although Britt traveled only within of Jacksonville, this provided opportunities to photograph the Oregon Coast, the Redwood Empire, the Siskiyou Mountains, the Rogue and Klamath rivers, and the deserts and lava beds east of the Cascades. Crater Lake by Peter Britt, 1874 Peter Britt is often remembered as the person who took the first successful photograph of Crater Lake. He did so in 1874, after his attempts in 1868 and 1869 had failed. His photos helped William Gladstone Steel persuade Congress to create Crater Lake National Park in 1902. Britt also painted Crater Lake. Many of Peter Britt's dry plate negatives, and those of his son Emil, are archived at the Southern Oregon Historical SocietySouthern Oregon Historical Society Research Library in Medford, Oregon. They are owned by Southern Oregon University. Images of many Britt prints may be viewed online. Jennie, a Rogue River Native American woman, who crafted the dress worn in this iconic Peter Britt portrait  Painting  Peter Britt began his career as an artist in Switzerland. Although he may have been primarily interested in painting nature studies and landscapes, he earned an income by painting portraits in Switzerland, Germany and possibly France. Once in the United States, Britt also painted portraits on commission, including one of Col. George Davenport completed just before Davenport was murdered by river pirates on July 4, 1845. This portrait, considered as \\"the foremost example of Peter Britt's portrait skill\\", now belongs to the Figge Art Museum. Since paints and canvases were difficult to obtain due to the lack of funds, Britt apparently ground minerals and mixed them with oil and pigments, and wove his own canvases from flax grown on the family farm. Britt returned to painting in his later years. He painted remembered views of Switzerland, portraits of Britt family members and Oregon scenes such as Crater Lake and Mill Creek Falls. Painting of Jacksonville, Oregon by Britt  Other pursuits  Long before he established Oregon's first winery, Valley View Vineyard, Peter Britt grew grapes and sold wine in Jacksonville. By 1880 he produced of wine per year, and eventually filled orders from as far away as Wyoming. Britt also produced and sold honey, peaches, apples and pears. Britt is known as the father of the southern Oregon fruit industry. He irrigated his property as early as 1855 and used smudging to fight frost. As an avid horticulturalistPeter Britt's Garden, Southern Oregon Historical Society, Britt imported plants from \\"most of the civilized world.\\" He particularly enjoyed growing semi-tropical plants, including palm trees, an Abyssinian banana tree, Smyrna figs and Japanese persimmons. The plants, unsuited to southern Oregon's climate, required exceptional care and in some cases a solarium. In September 1903, Professor A. B. Cordley and Professor E. R. Lake, of the Oregon Agricultural College at Corvallis, while in Jacksonville for the fruit-growers convention paid a visit to Britt's home and examined the park about the house and his collection of trees, shrubs, and flowers.Some Entertaining and Instructive Drives, Jacksonville Sentinel, September 11, 1903, p. 5. In addition to obtaining land for his orchards, gardens and vineyard, Britt invested in land farmed by tenant farmers, and held deeds to over . Britt also made money by making loans secured by land, and unsecured personal loans. Miller indicates Britt was a reasonable, perhaps even generous, landlord and lender. Britt also dealt fairly with Chinese miners, lending them grubstakes until he finally hung a sign \\"No More Money to Loan\\", but still provided shacks on his property to Chinese laborers who mined gold on his land.Britt Properties, Southern Oregon Historical Society Britt and later his son Emil devoted significant time to at least one endeavor, weather reporting, that netted no income. Notes in Britt's diary began in 1859, when he used a pocket sundial and a homemade rain gauge. From 1870 to 1891, Britt reported weather to the Signal Corps Weather Service, using their equipment. Emil Britt reported to the Weather Bureau for another 58 years.  Civic duties  Britt house in Jacksonville, c. 1900. A fire in 1960 completely leveled the house Peter Britt was a civic leader in his community. He served on the Jacksonville City Council twice, and on various committees. He belonged to at least four German American organizations, The Turnverein, Jacksonville Harmonie; Improved Order of Red Men, and Eintracht, a German Swiss mutual aid group. Britt handled correspondence for Eintracht, found work for young emigrants, and provided occasional lodging for travelers. After one member, Frederich Ruch, and his wife committed suicide, Peter Britt became guardian for their three sons. Britt did not participate in Jacksonville's religious community, although his children were baptized by Moses Williams, the first Presbyterian minister in Southern Oregon, and remained Presbyterians throughout their lives. Peter Britt was a follower of Robert Ingersoll, an agnostic. Britt served as vice president of the Oregon State Secular Union and helped establish the now defunct Liberal University at Silverton, Oregon, in 1896.  Legacy  Britt made lasting contributions to the industry and culture of the Rogue Valley. His artistic legacy includes multiple photographs, and close to 800 of them are preserved by the Southern Oregon University and the Southern Oregon Historical Society.

It is based on the true story of John Ruskin's marriage to Euphemia Gray and the subsequent annulment of their marriage. Effie Gray was released worldwide by Universal Pictures in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2014 and in America on 3 April 2015. Plot In a pre-credit sequence Effie Gray is seen walking through a garden speaking about a fairy story in which a girl married a man with wicked parents. After the credits, the marriage of Effie to John Ruskin in Perth, Scotland is seen. The couple travel to London to stay with his parents. Effie soon begins to feel isolated, especially as she is repeatedly belittled by John's mother. Her distress is compounded by the fact that her husband shows no interest in consummating the marriage and refuses to discuss the subject. At the Royal Academy of Arts, John and Effie attend a dinner at which there is heated debate about the new Pre-Raphaelite movement in art, which John supports. John convinces Sir Charles Eastlake, the president of the academy, to allow the young artists to exhibit their pictures. Effie attracts the attention of Sir Charles' wife, Elizabeth. When the Eastlakes visit the Ruskins, Elizabeth sees how distressed Effie is in the repressive atmosphere of the Ruskin family. Effie hopes that matters will improve when they travel to Venice, where John will be researching his new book The Stones of Venice. But when they get there, John busies himself studying the many historic monuments of the city, leaving Effie in the company of Raffaele, a young Italian. Effie enjoys the city life, but is distressed when Raffaele nearly rapes her. Her husband seems oblivious to the situation. Effie dreads returning to the Ruskin family. Back at their house she suffers from a string of nervous ailments. Her doctor advises fresh air and more attention from her husband. John says they intend to travel to Scotland where John Everett Millais, one of the Pre-Raphaelites, will paint his portrait. In Scotland, Millais befriends Effie, and becomes increasingly disturbed by John's dismissive attitude to his wife. He is deeply embarrassed when John leaves the two of them alone together for several nights when he visits Edinburgh. Effie and Millais fall in love. Millais convinces her to take someone she trusts with her and to explore the options for divorce. Effie sends for her sister Sophie, claiming that Sophie wants to see the capital. Together they visit Elizabeth Eastlake. Effie tells her that she is still a virgin and that John has told her he was disgusted by her body on their wedding night. Elizabeth advises her to seek legal advice. Effie is examined by a doctor, who confirms her virginity. Her lawyer tells her the marriage can be annulled. Effie leaves for Scotland, supposedly to accompany her sister, but really to leave John forever. Before she leaves London, she visits Millais, but only communicates with him via her sister. Millais says he will wait for her. Ruskin's family is horrified when Effie's lawyer calls round with a notification of annulment proceedings on the grounds of John's impotence.

Eve Pomerance, author of two scripts on the same subject as Thompson's screenplay, brought the first case. One of the scripts had been produced as a stage play. The judge ruled in December 2012 that Thompson's script was not in breach of copyright and could be released. Another copyright dispute arose, with playwright Gregory Murphy, author of the play The Countess which had been positively received, and ran Off-Broadway for 634 performances during the 1999/00 season. The matter was decided in Emma Thompson's favour in March 2013. The judge’s ruling was based on a second, revised screenplay that the court allowed Emma Thompson to submit in the middle of the case, which Murphy called \\"unprecedented.\\" Murphy appealed against the ruling, but the Second Circuit rejected Murphy's appeal.Emma Thompson Didn't Steal 'Effie' Script, 2nd Circ. Says, Law360, 7 May 2014 The District Court then ordered Murphy to reimburse Effie Film, LLC $500,000 for its legal fees. Murphy filed an appeal, but in debt for hundreds of thousands of dollars as the result of the initial lawsuit instigated by Effie Film, petitioned the Court for pro bono counsel. Lawyers from the law firm of Winston & Strawn representing Effie Film successfully blocked Murphy’s petition for pro bono counsel, and filed a motion that Murphy be required to put up a bond of $125,000 before his case could be heard on appeal. In the year-long court battle that ensued, Murphy, representing himself, fought both the $500,000 fee award and the $125,000 bond motion. The case was eventually moved to the United States Court of Appeals. On 16 October 2015 the three-judge panel for the Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in Murphy’s favour, dismissing Winston & Strawn’s motion for a bond requirement and ruling that the District Court had \\"abused its discretion\\" in awarding Effie Film its $500,000 in legal fees, adding that the Court of Appeals had never characterized Murphy’s original claims of infringement as \\"frivolous\\" or \\"objectively unreasonable\\" as Winston & Strawn contended. The Court of Appeals also ordered Effie Film, LLC to pay Murphy $603.80 for his court costs. The release date was put back to October 2013, but the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California at which it was to be premiered under the title Effie Gray.Emma Thompson's film about Effie Gray is withdrawn from film festival, Daily Telegraph, 15 October 2013 In December 2013, Thompson said the film’s time had \\"probably passed\\". The film was finally released in October 2014.Rachel Campbell-Johnston, The Times Saturday Review, 23 August 2014 Thompson did not attend its London premiere, nor did she promote the film. Reception Effie Gray has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 42%, based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Effie Gray benefits from its strong cast, elevating a period drama that doesn't strike quite as many narrative sparks as it could.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 54 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Mark Kermode said that the film \\"intelligently dramatises the prison-like nature of Effie’s status while struggling to engage us in what is essentially a non-relationship...we have a handsome but rather inert portrait of a suffocating social milieu in which it is left to Thompson herself to inject vibrant relief as the independently minded Lady Eastlake.\\"Kermode, Mark, \\"Effie Gray review – a handsome but inert portrait\\", The Observer, Sunday 12 October 2014. Tim Robey in The Telegraph said that \\"There are clever and sensitive touches right through, and a moving ending. But Fanning seems wholly uncomfortable, and not always intentionally. She's meant to be playing a trapped Pre-Raphaelite muse, frequently ill and/or sedated, but moons her way through the film seeming mostly dazed and confused.\\"Robey, Tim, \\"Effie Gray, review: 'a damp portrait'\\", The Telegraph, 9 October 2014. David Sexton, in contrast, praised Fanning's performance as \\"remarkably good\\", but objected to the caricatured portrait of Ruskin and what he called the \\"Everyday Feminism\\" of the portrayal of Effie as a victim.Sexton, David, \\"Effie Gray - film review: 'Dakota Fanning is remarkably good but Emma Thompson’s script makes John Ruskin out to be a sexist villain\\", London Evening Standard, 10 October 2014. Stephen Dalton in The Hollywood Reporter was unflattering, calling the film \\"an exquisitely dreary slice of middlebrow armchair theater which adds little new to a much-filmed story. Despite a lurid plot involving sex scandal, family dysfunction and proto- feminist revolt, the end result is depressingly conventional and deadeningly tasteful...yet another surface-level rehash of Victorian costume-drama clichés.\\" However, Fanning's \\"wounded, emotionally conflicted performance\\" was praised.Dalton, Stephen, \\"Effie Gray\\", The Hollywood Reporter, 10 October 2014.

Parker, Professor Emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, specialized in the history of the Black Hills of South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. He was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame in 2011 for his work. Background Parker was born in 1924. He was raised on his family's dude ranch and resort, the Palmer Gulch Lodge, at the base of Black Elk Peak near Hill City, South Dakota. Hill City is called the \\"Heart of the Hills\\" because of its location near the center of the Black Hills. Parker operated the Palmer Gulch Lodge until 1960, when he left home to study history. The Parker family continued to run the ranch until 1962. He received a doctorate in history in 1965 from the University of Oklahoma. Career Parker authored four books, as well as numerous papers and notes on the history of the Black Hills throughout his career. Among his best known works are Deadwood: The Golden Years and Gold in the Black Hills. In a 2011 interview in which he discussed Deadwood: The Golden Years, a history of Deadwood, South Dakota, Parker recalled: \\"The University (of Nebraska) said they wanted a serious book about Deadwood. I told 'em '...maybe somewhat serious, but not solemn. Deadwood is not that kind of town.'\\" Parker devoted considerable research to the history of the Black Hills' ghost towns. He co- authored a survey of the region's ghost towns, Black Hills Ghost Towns, with historian Hugh Lambert. =Teaching= He taught history at University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh for twenty-one years before retiring to the Black Hills. He continued to write, research and lecture after retirement. He was also a supporter and consultant for the Adams Museum & House in Deadwood. Parker's works were used as research for the American television series Deadwood, which aired on HBO from 2004 to 2006. According to Mary Kopco, the director of the Deadwood History Foundation, the first book that Deadwood creator and director David Milch purchased as research for the show was Parker's Deadwood: The Golden Years. Milch and his staff later bought many of Parker's books and papers for the show. Induction into South Dakota Hall of Fame In September 2011, Parker was one of fourteen South Dakotans inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame at a ceremony held at the Cedar Shore Resort in Oacoma, South Dakota. The other thirteen inductees included cave explorers Herb and Jan Conn, businessman Norm McKie, former Rapid City Mayor Don Barnett, Lynn Seppala, Gene Abdallah, Curtis Hage, Dana Dykhouse, Donus Roberts, Amiel Narcelle Redfish, Gary Conradi, William Hinks and Tony Dean.

The model theorizes that group members will work to maintain a balance, or equilibrium, between task- oriented (instrumental) and socio-emotional (expressive) needs.Bales, R. F. (1950). Interaction process analysis. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.Bales, R. F. (1970). Personality and interpersonal behavior. New York: Holt Rinehart & Winston. A group can be successful if it maintains this equilibrium.  Description  The equilibrium model was created by Robert Bales, who conducted early empirical studies on group development.Hare, A. P. (1967). Handbook of small group research. New York: The Free Press. Bales, R. F., & Strodbeck, F. L. (1951). Phases in group problem solving.

Small Group Research, 23, 524-572. doi:10.1177/1046496492234005 The equilibrium model is a progressive model as it explains group maturity and performance over a given period of time.Chidambaram, L. & Bostrom, R. P. (1996). Group development (I): A review and synthesis of development models. Group Decision and Negotiation, 6, 159-187. Bales proposed the model as a means to study the manifestation and incidence of task-oriented and socio- emotional behaviours.Carabajal, K., LaPointe, D., Gunawardena, C. N. (2003). Group development in online learning communities. In M. G. Moore & W. G. Anderson (Ed.), Handbook of distance education (pp. 217-234). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. There are three main stages of group development within the equilibrium model.  Stages  * The first stage is orientation. Group members meet, ask questions and exchange information. Task-oriented behaviours are prevalent. * The second stage is evaluation. Group members express their opinions and attitudes. Socio-emotional behaviours increase. * The third stage is control. Group members exert pressure to influence group actions and activities. Overall, as a group moves throughout the three stages, task-oriented behaviours decline while socio-emotional behaviours increase  Equilibrium  Successful group performance and cohesiveness is achieved once a group has matured and the members are able to maintain equilibrium between how well they can solve the task or problem facing the group (task-oriented behaviours) with how well they deal with interpersonal relationships and member satisfaction (socio-emotional behaviours). Equilibrium may be temporary. For example, as the group encounters a new situation or takes on new members, the group may need to move through the three main stages again.

Vacancy  The by-election was caused by the elevation to the peerage of the sitting Liberal MP Sir Nathaniel Rothschild (usually known as 'Natty') of the famous Rothschild merchant banking family. Rothschild had been one of the two MPs for Aylesbury since 1865. However, since the formation of the Liberal government of W E Gladstone in 1880, Rothschild had become increasingly disillusioned with the policies of his leader. In particular he was odds with Gladstone's foreign policy in the Middle East and domestically he was an opponent of Irish home rule.Victor Gray and Melanie Aspey, Nathaniel Mayer de Rothschild in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-13 It is likely that Gladstone agreed to send Rothschild to the House of Lords to reinforce his Liberal sympathies or perhaps to have him replaced in the Commons by someone more supportive of party policy. In neither case was he successful.  Candidates  The Liberals chose another scion of the Rothschild family, Ferdinand de Rothschild. 'Ferdy' Rothschild, who was aged 46 years at the time of the by-election, was a man of considerable independent means as a result of his family connections and spent most of his time in art collecting and appreciation, although he also had a great fondness for country sports. It was Ferdy who was responsible for the building of the magnificent, Château-like Waddesdon Manor. Ferdinand was the brother-in-law of Natty Rothschild, who was the brother of Ferdy's late wife Evelina (1839-1866). Natty did not like Ferdinand and considered him 'effete, fussy and pretentious'.R W Davies, Ferdinand James Anselm de Rothschild in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online, 2004-13 However politically, as it turned out, Ferdinand was in tune with his brother-in-law as they both moved from the Liberal to the Liberal Unionist Party cutting themselves off from Gladstone on the issue of Ireland.Ian Cawood, The Liberal Unionist Party: A History; I B Tauris, 2012 pp. 157–158 The Conservatives, who had history of sharing the Aylesbury seat with the Liberals, chose Mr William Graham as their candidate.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1832-1885; Macmillan, 1977 p33 The campaign Graham announced his candidature and launched his campaign at the market ordinary held at the George Hotel in Aylesbury on 27 June 1885 with a speech to assembled businessmen.The Times, 29 June 1885 p6 Rothschild issued an address to the electors on 30 June. Among the reforms he said he would support were measures for making the transfer of land cheaper and easier, equalising duties on property and the abolition or modification of the law on entail. He was in favour of some degree of the licensing of public houses to be placed in the hands of the ratepayers, deplored the economic conditions which had afflicted rural areas and pledged to do what he could to alleviate hardships and make the cultivation of land more attractive. He stated that every cottage occupier should be given enough garden ground to grow his own food and, like other members of his family, said he was strongly supportive of measures designed to extend and secure civil and religious rights. He was a free trader, opposed to any levies of taxes on imported food.The Times, 30 June 1885 p6 These articulate sounding views may not however have been all Ferdinand's own work. The Liberal politician Lewis 'Loulou' Harcourt regarded Ferdy as something of a political protégée but wrote in his diary that while he was glad Ferdinand had been selected as candidate, senior Liberals had reservations that he was capable of getting through the campaign without someone to look after him. He also recorded that Ferdy was 'profoundly ignorant on all political subjects and was in need of a great deal of cramming'. Fortunately, Harcourt records, he was to visit the constituency soon and speak for Rothschild and no doubt did his best to bring his protégée up to scratch.Patrick Jackson, Loulou: Selected Extracts from the Journals of Lewis Harcourt, 1880-1895; Rosemont Publishing and Printing, 2006 p106 Meetings and canvassing took place, with visits from Liberal and Conservative MPs – some were described as 'uproarious'The Times, 11 July 1885 p13 and a free for all took place outside the George Hotel after polls had closed on the evening of 16 July.The Times, 18 July 1885 p12  Result  Rothschild comfortably held the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 937 votes. This seems to have come as something of a surprise for the other Liberal MP for Aylesbury, George Russell. On the eve of poll, Russell had confided in Louisa, Lady Knightley of Fawsley, the wife of Tory MP Rainald Knightley, that he was low at the possible outcome of the contest. Lady Knightley recorded in her journal that it would be a triumph if the Conservatives were to beat Rothschild.Peter Gordon, The Journals of Lady Knightley of Fawsley, 1885-1913; Northamptonshire Records Society, 1999 p76 This is confirmed by Loulou Harcourt who wrote in his Journal for 17 July 1885 that when he got a telegram from Rothschild with the result of the by-election he was pleased the majority was very much larger than expected and most satisfactory for most of the electors were agricultural labourers.Patrick Jackson, Loulou: Selected Extracts from the Journals of Lewis Harcourt, 1880-1895; Rosemont Publishing and Printing, 2006 p107 The result must also therefore have been a relief to Gladstone and the Liberal leadership, although not for too long in view of the Rothschilds' defection to the cause of Liberal Unionism. Ferdy Rothschild held his seat as a Liberal at the 1885 general election and retained it as a Liberal Unionist thereafter at every election until dying in office in December 1898.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results, 1885-1918; Macmillan, 1974 p224  Votes See also *Aylesbury *List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868–1885)  References  Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Buckinghamshire constituencies Category:1885 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1885 in England Category:19th century in Buckinghamshire Category:Aylesbury Category:July 1885 events ","title":"1885 Aylesbury by-election"},{"id":"38219893","text":"Carmen Milagros Ortiz (born January 5, 1956) is an attorney, college instructor, and former United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. In 2009, she was nominated to the position by President Barack Obama. Ortiz was both the first woman and the first Hispanic to serve as U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. She succeeded Michael Sullivan in that position, with Michael J. Loucks serving as the interim U.S. Attorney between Sullivan's resignation and Ortiz's confirmation. Noteworthy prosecutions by her office include those of Whitey Bulger, Tarek Mehanna, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as well as the controversial prosecution of Aaron Swartz. In December 2016, Ortiz announced that she would step down from her post in January. Her announcement was not unexpected, due to the fact that President Donald Trump would have the authority to name new U.S. Attorneys. Early life and education Born in New York City to Puerto Rican parents, Ortiz grew up in East Harlem. Ortiz has said that, as a child, watching Perry Mason on television inspired her to become a lawyer. After graduating from The Saint Agnes School in 1974, Ortiz earned her B.B.A from Adelphi University in 1978, working in her family's gift shop during her years there. Ortiz later earned her J.D. at George Washington University's National Law Center in 1981. In the summer of 1980, Ortiz interned in the Public Integrity Section of the United States Department of Justice with Eric Holder, who later became U.S. Attorney General. She also worked on judicial reform in Guatemala with Harvard professor, former Watergate prosecutor, and former deputy attorney general Philip Heymann. Legal career From 1981 to 1983, Ortiz was an attorney with the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division. Ortiz served as Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, in two stints: 1983 to 1988 and 1991 to 1994. In 1988, Ortiz went into the private sector with the Braintree law firm Marinelli & Morisi, where she would work until 1989. Ortiz also coordinated the Center for Criminal Justice at Harvard Law School from 1988 to 1991. In 1990, after being appointed by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, she served on a commission that investigated allegations of sexual harassment against members of the New England Patriots. In 1997, Ortiz became an Assistant U.S. Attorney. In September 2017, Ortiz joined the Boston-based law firm of Anderson & Kreiger. In December 2019, it was announced she will be made a partner at the firm. United States Attorney In May 2009, Senators Ted Kennedy and John Kerry recommended Ortiz to President Obama for the vacant United States Attorney position in the District of Massachusetts. On September 18, Obama nominated Ortiz for the position. On November 5, the United States Senate confirmed her appointment by unanimous consent. Ortiz was both the first woman and the first Hispanic to serve as United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. Ortiz was rebuffed in several harshly worded rulings by judges on cases brought by her office, which was accused of \\"stretching the evidence\\" and \\"gross exaggeration\\" by judge Judith Dein, of an \\"overkill\\" and \\"unusual prosecution\\" by judge Douglas Woodlock, of being \\"over the top\\" by judge Nancy Gertner. = White collar cases = In 2011, Ortiz's office was responsible for the prosecution of GlaxoSmithKline general counsel Lauren Stevens. Ultimately, the court dismissed the case, ruling that \\"it would be a miscarriage of justice to permit this case to go to the jury.\\"http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/110510stevens.pdf On March 23, 2012, Ortiz's office secured grand jury indictments against former state Probation Commissioner John J. O’Brien and two of his former deputies, Elizabeth Tavares and William Burke III, for their involvement in running a sham hiring system in which friends and family members of legislators and politically connected job seekers were hired over more qualified applicants. Each faces one count of racketeering conspiracy and 10 counts of mail fraud for sending rejection letters to applicants they knew they were never going to consider. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison on each of the 11 counts. Ortiz said the indictments are “one step in an ongoing investigation.” In 2015, Ortiz was expected to pursue $1.1 million 'Insider Trading' scam involving two Indian Americans Iftikar Ahmed & Amit Kanodia which involved sharing of insider information leading to illegal gains in the NYSE. = Whitey Bulger case = Carmen Ortiz's office led the prosecution of mobster Whitey Bulger. On July 6, 2011, Bulger was arraigned in federal court. He pleaded not guilty to 48 charges, including 19 counts of murder, extortion, money laundering, obstruction of justice, perjury, narcotics distribution and weapons violations. Ortiz's office also led the prosecution of Bulger's girlfriend Catherine Greig. In March 2012, Greig plead guilty to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud, and conspiracy to commit identity fraud. On June 12, 2012, she was sentenced to eight years' confinement in a federal penitentiary. = Terrorism and drug cases = Carmen Ortiz led the prosecution of American pharmacist Tarek Mehanna, who was accused of, among other crimes, translating and posting online materials described by prosecutors as Al Qaeda propaganda. Mehanna's lawyers argued that he never tried to join an armed group and never tried to hurt anyone, and that his internet activities were protected under the U.S. First Amendment. In April 2012, Mehanna was sentenced in federal court in Boston on four terrorism- related charges and three others related to lying to agents of the FBI and other U.S. federal officials. Ortiz came under fire after her office was involved in the January 19, 2013 arrest of a man who reportedly \\"looks very much like\\" a wanted drug suspect.Fumbling feds say wrong man may have been nabbed The man was released by a federal magistrate the following day after prosecutors admitted \\"significant doubt\\" that the arrested man was indeed the suspect.Bad Week For Carmen Ortiz: Admits To Botched Gang Arrest As Congress Kicks Off Swartz Investigation =Donald Gonczy case= Ortiz was \\"admonished by a federal appeals court in 2004 for advocating a harsher jail term for a fraud defendant than she had promised him in a plea-bargain agreement.\\" In a plea deal, Ortiz had agreed to leniency, but she \\"substantively argued\\" for a harsher sentence. The Appeals Court ruled that Ortiz \\"violated the plea agreement it entered into with Gonczy,\\" and it vacated the sentence. = Motel Caswell confiscation case = Ortiz's office sought to confiscate the Motel Caswell in Tewksbury, Massachusetts from its owner, Russ Caswell. Prosecutors contended that, despite the fact that Caswell himself had never been charged with any crime, his property was subject to civil forfeiture as a long-term site of criminal activity. Ortiz's spokeswoman said \\"The government believed that this was an important case, not only for the town of Tewksbury, which has been plagued for decades by the criminal activity at Motel Caswell, but because of the important deterrent message it sends to others who may turn a blind eye to crime occurring at their place of business.\\" The property had been the location of 15 drug crimes between 1994 and 2008, which Caswell said is small considering that he rents about 14,000 rooms per year. Caswell was represented by the Institute for Justice, a non-profit libertarian public interest law firm that frequently intervenes in asset forfeiture cases.https://www.ij.org/massachusetts-civil-forfeiture On January 24, 2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith Dein sided with Caswell. In a written decision, Dein dismissed the government’s forfeiture action, ruling that Caswell, \\"who was trying to eke out an income from a business located in a drug-infested area that posed great risks to the safety of him and his family, took all reasonable steps to prevent crime. The Government’s resolution of the crime problem should not be to simply take his Property.\\" In the ruling, the court criticized the prosecution for \\"stretching the evidence\\" and engaging in \\"gross exaggeration.\\"http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/massachusetts/madce/1:2009cv11635/124642/126/0.pdf?1359117603 After considering an appeal, her office announced that in March 2013 that they would not pursue the matter further. = Prosecution of Aaron Swartz = Ortiz's office prosecuted computer programmer and Internet activist Aaron Swartz. In 2011, Swartz was arrested for unauthorized, bulk downloading of free articles from internet archive JSTOR, in violation of the JSTOR's terms of use. In a 2011 press release announcing Swartz's indictment on federal charges, Ortiz said \\"Stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.\\" After State Prosecutors dropped their charges, federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment adding nine more felony counts, which increased Swartz's maximum criminal exposure to 50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines. The prosecution brought by Ortiz involved what was characterized by numerous critics such as former White House Counsel John Dean as \\"overcharging\\" and \\"overzealous\\" prosecution for the alleged computer crimes.\\"Dealing With Aaron Swartz in the Nixonian Tradition: Overzealous Overcharging Leads to a Tragic Result\\", Justia, John Dean, January 25, 2013. Retrieved May 26, 2014. In all, prosecutors charged Swartz with 13 felony counts, despite the fact that both MIT and JSTOR had chosen not to pursue civil litigation; he faced 30 years' imprisonment. Swartz committed suicide on January 11, 2013, before the case came to trial. More than 60,000 people petitioned the White House to remove Ortiz from office for \\"overreach.\\"White House Must Respond to Petition to Remove U.S. Attorney in Aaron Swartz CaseAaron Swartz' Death Fuels MIT Probe, White House Petition to Oust Prosecutor - ABC NewsPetition Against Aaron Swartz Prosecutor - Business Insider On January 15, 2013, following his suicide, all charges against Swartz were dropped. The next day, Ortiz issued a statement saying that her office had never intended to seek maximum penalties against Aaron Swartz. However the same day Ortiz's husband, IBM executive Tom Dolan, scolded the Swartz family for issuing a statement criticizing the prosecutors and MIT. He rationalized: \\"Truly incredible that in their own son's obit they blame others for his death and make no mention of the 6-month offer.\\"Murphey, Shelly, US attorney's husband stirs Twitter storm on Swartz case, The Boston Globe, January 16, 2013..

Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly published an op-ed piece by Massachusetts criminal defense attorney Harvey Silverglate about the case. He said attorneys familiar with the case had told him the Middlesex County District Attorney's office had planned for Swartz's case to be \\"continued without a finding, with Swartz duly admonished and then returned to civil society to continue his pioneering electronic work in a less legally questionable manner.\\" \\"Under such a disposition,\\" Silverglate later told CNET's Declan McCullagh, \\"the charge is held in abeyance (\\"continued\\") without any verdict (\\"without a finding\\"). The defendant is on probation for a period of a few months up to maybe a couple of years at the most; if the defendant does not get into further legal trouble, the charge is dismissed, and the defendant has no criminal record. This is what the lawyers expected to happen when Swartz was arrested. But then the feds took over....\\" \\"Tragedy intervened,\\" Silverglate wrote, \\"when Ortiz's office took over the case to send 'a message'.\\" Boston's WBUR reported in February 2013 that Ortiz was expected to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's probe into the handling of the Aaron Swartz case. The Department of Justice gave a private briefing about the case to the House Committee, and subsequently, in March 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder defended Ortiz's aggressive prosecution before the Senate Judiciary Committee, terming it, \\"a good use of prosecutorial discretion.\\"Holder defends Swartz prosecution, Boston Globe, David Umberti, March 7, 2013. Retrieved May 16, 2014. In January 2015, two years after Swartz’s death, the White House declined to act on the petition to remove Ortiz from office. =Boston Marathon bombings= Ortiz's office led the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombing. On June 27, 2013, Ortiz unveiled a grand jury's 30-count indictment against suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. On July 10, 2013, Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all charges. On August 8, 2013, two of Tsarnaev's friends were indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges. Another Ortiz prosecution, this time of Tamerlan's friend Khairullozhon Matanov who pleaded guilty rather than face 20 years in prison, has been described as overzealous. =Martin Gottesfeld case= In 2017 Ortiz was prosecuting Gottesfeld under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for taking the Boston Children's Hospital website down during an online donation drive to protest the hospital's treatment of Justina Pelletier.Martin Gottesfeld, Anonymous hacktivist, charged over hospital DDoS attacks - The Washington TimesAnonymous hacker begins second week of hunger strike in prison NewsweekThe Successful Hospital Cyber Attack That Hurt No One And Helped Save This Girl Huffington Post Pelletier, who was taken from her family by the hospital under a controversial Massachusetts law, ended up losing the use of her legs under the hospital's treatment plan.Why I Knocked Boston Children’s Hospital Off The Internet: A Statement From Martin Gottesfeld Huffington PostFamily of Justina Pelletier sues Boston Children’s Hospital Boston.comParents of Justina Pelletier sue Boston Children’s Hospital Boston Globe Martin Gottesfeld claimed responsibility for an attack by Anonymous that prevented the Boston Children's Hospital (and other treatment facilities) from receiving donations for limited period of time with denial-of-service attacks that briefly prevented access to a public website or server.

Personal life Ortiz has two daughters and is married to IBM executive Thomas J. Dolan; her first husband, Michael Vittorio Morisi, died in 2000. Ortiz reportedly considered a campaign for Governor of Massachusetts, but she denied interest in such a run.

Life In Bologna, he studied from 1711 to 1712 under Andrea Ferreri (1673–1744) . He was also a pupil of Giuseppe Maria Mazza. After 1718 he studied in Rome under Camillo Rusconi (1658-1728). In 1721 Piò became a member of the Accademia Clementina in Bologna. He worked with some of the prime Bolognese architects of the time: Carlo Francesco Dotti, Alfonso Torreggiani and Giuseppe Antonio Ambrosi. His son, pupil and assistant was Domenico Piò (1715-1799). Other pupils included Filippo Scandellari (brother of Pietro) and Antonio Schiassi (died 1778).Annali della città di Bologna dalle sua origine al 1796, by Salvatore Muzzi; Bologna, 1846, Volume 8, page 746. Work Interior of the Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi in Bologna Piò mainly used stucco and colored terracotta, working in the Emilian Rococo style. He used these materials due to the scarcity of stone and marble, but was able to closely imitate stone carving. His works were mostly of religious, allegorical or mythological subjects. His more notable works include Fortitude and Prudence (Bologna, Gozzadini palace), Agony in the Garden (parish church of San Giovanni in Persiceto) and the funeral memorial of General Marsili (1733, San Domenico, Bologna). Angelo Piò created over twenty full-length plaster statues for the Sanctuary of San Luca, from 1746 onwards. The architect Carlo Francesco Dotti designed this church. In this work he collaborated with the plasterers Antonio Calegari and Joseph Borelli, who made the scrolls with Biblical sayings, and with Gaetano Lollini, who created the statues in the second chapel on the right. He also made a commemorative posthumous bust of the architect, which remains in the church.

She was the lady in waiting, lectrice, and favorite of the Countess of Provence, Marie Joséphine of Savoy, consort of the future king Louis XVIII of France. Life She was born in a merchant family in Gray as Jeanne-Marguerite Gallois, and married to the noble Charles-Florent de Gourbillon, who was an post official at Lille, in 1763. =Court life= In 1785, she was appointed lectrice (reader) to the princess Marie Joséphine, consort of prince Louis, count de Provence, brother of king Louis XVI of France. Marguerite de Gourbillon formed a very close and intimate relationship with Marie Joséphine, which may or may not have been physical. Already in 1780, there had been rumors in libels that Marie Josephine was lesbian, as her lady-in-waiting Anne de Balbi was said to play the same role for her that Madame de Polignac played for the queen (indicating a sexual relationship, as de Polignac was alleged to be the lover of the queen).Jennifer Evans & Alun Withey, New Perspectives on the History of Facial Hair: Framing the Face, 2018 After the count the Provence had initiated his relationship with Anne de Balbi, Marie Josephine isolated herself with her women courtiers, and Gourbillon came to have such an intimate relationship to her that it attracted attention: Gourbillon was reportedly so certain of Marie Josephine's affection that she became provocative and was said to dominate Marie Josephine and her household, and it was noted that they spent late nights together alone. Gourbillon was suspected of \\"corrupting\\" Marie Josephine, and to inducing her to drink or, at least, to provide her with alcohol. Prince Louis disliked the influence she had over his consort. In February 1789, Provence successfully asked his brother, Louis XVI, to issue a lettre de cachet, which expelled Gourbillon to her husband in Lille. This took place after an incident which convinced the king that Gourbillon had a corrupting influence upon Marie Josephine: one evening, the king and the count de Provence encountered Gourbillon in a passageway carrying a pot which she was trying to hide, and which was discovered to contain alcohol. Her banishment was only temporary, however, and in 1790, she was allowed to return to her position. In June 1791, Gourbillon accompanied Marie Joséphine in exile to Germany during the French revolution. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple.Nagel, Susan. Marie-Therese, Child of Terror: The Fate of Marie Antoinette's Daughter, 2008 =Exile= During the exile, Gourbillon lived with Marie Joséphine first in Savoy and then in Kiel in Germany. In 1799, Marie Joséphine was asked by Louis to join him in Mitau in Russian Courland to attend the wedding between her husband's niece Marie-Thérèse Charlotte to her husband's nephew Louis Antoine d'Artois, duc d'Angoulême at the French exile court, which lived there under the protection of the Russian Tsar. However, Louis demanded that she leave Gourbillon behind. After having written to the Tsar to ask him to intervene on Gourbillon's behalf, and having received no reply, they traveled there together nonetheless. When Marie Joséphine arrived with Gourbillon, their carriage was stopped before they reached the palace in Mitau, and Gourbillon was forcibly separated from Marie Joséphine. Marie Joséphine reacted by a public protest in front of the whole court upon her arrival, when she openly declared that she refused to change out of her clothes or install herself in her quarters before Gourbillon was given permission to join her. This was unsuccessful, and she thereafter refused to leave her rooms, where she isolated herself with a bottle of whiskey. This scene caused a public scandal. Gourbillon later managed to have her revenge by convincing the Tsar to expel Louis from Russia in 1801. When Louis and Marie Joséphine left for Great Britain in 1808, Gourbillon followed them there and settled in London, where she made repeated attempts to reunite with Marie Joséphine; Louis, however, refused to allow it and would not receive her.

Since 1986 it has been the seat of the Archbishop of Urbino-Urbania-Sant'Angelo in Vado, and was previously the seat of the Archbishops of Urbino. History The first cathedral on the site was built here in 1021, to replace an earlier one located outside the city walls. Under the patronage of Count Federico da Montefeltro, it was rebuilt in the 15th century, based on a design attributed to Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Construction was not finished until 1604. The west front, using stone quarried from Furlo, was designed by Camillo Morigia and completed in 1782. It was ornamented with five statues, representing the three theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, between Saint Augustine to the left and Saint John Chrysostom to the right. Interior Chapel of the Immaculate Conception On 12 January 1789, a powerful earthquake toppled the cupola, and made a reconstruction necessary. The project was entrusted to Giuseppe Valadier, and completed by 1801 in the present Neoclassical style. Interior Valadier's Neocassical interior is on a Latin cross groundplan and has a central nave between two side aisles, under a barrel vaulted roof. The crossing of the transept supports an impressive coffered cupola. As to works of art, the cathedral contains two canvases by Federigo Barocci, a Saint Sebastian in the north aisle, and a Last Supper in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament. There is also an Assumption of the Virgin (circa 1707) by Carlo Maratta, and a Nativity (1708) by Carlo Cignani. On the pendentives of the cupola are depicted the Four Evangelists (18th century), possibly by Domenico Corvi and Giuseppe Cades. The main altarpiece, by Christopher Unterberger, represents the Madonna between the city's patron saints. Tomb of Polydore Vergil The humanist scholar and historian Polydore Vergil died in Urbino in 1555, and was buried in the Cathedral, in the chapel of St Andrew which he himself had endowed. It was agreed in 1613 that a memorial stone should be set over his tomb. This was eventually put in place in 1631, with an inscription stating that his fame would \\"live for ever in the world\\". However, it is believed to have been lost in the 1789 earthquake.

He established Kirata Kingdom in 800 B.C.Kirat Yoyakhha His capital was Kathmandu Valley (Thankot) after conquering Central Nepal and his kingdom extended from Kashmir Valley in the west to river Teesta in the east of Bhutan. The epic Mahabharata mentions the Kiratas as a Mleccha tribe along with Pulindas and Chinas, Hunas, Pahlavas, Sakas, Yavanas, Savaras, Paundras, Kanchis, Dravidas, Sinhalas and Keralas. All these tribes were described as Mlechha tribes. The Kamvojas, Gandharas, Kiratas and Barbaras were also mentioned together as northern tribes.

In Nepal, Kirati king Yalambar, is believed to be the Barbarik of Mahabharata, son of Ghatotkach and grandson of Bheem. Barbarik had the dubious honor of being slain in the battle of the Mahabharata, in which gods and mortals fought alongside each other. Legend credits him with meeting Indra, the lord of heaven, who ventured into the Valley in human guise. It is said that during the battle of Mahabharata, Barbarik went to witness the battle with a vow to take the side of the losing party. Lord Krishna, knowing the vow of Barbarik and his strength of three arrows, thought that the war would ended with only one survival and that is Barbarik himself by killing warriors of both sides. So, by a clever stroke of diplomacy, Lord Krishna cut of Barbarik's head. So, in his honour Indrajatra is celebrated and his head is worshped as god Akash Bhairav.Harekrishna Organization Barbarikik is also known as Khatushyam and Baliyadev in Rajasthan and Gujrat respectively.

The video was taken at Took A Leap Farm, a hobby farm in Houlton, Maine. About The video was posted on 27 July with the caption \\"Buttermilk 'plays' with her 'friends'\\". Buttermilk Sky is seen running animatedly about in a grassy clearing while three other goats of similar size and age look on. On several occasions she jumps up, even hopping over other goats and accosting a human observer. At one point she leaps up and knocks another goat down, an act which has sparked criticism from some Internet commentators for its apparently wilful nature. The video has received over seven million views on YouTube, has been commented on by Maine Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, and has been featured on The Today Show. Media Appearances Buttermilk Sky is part of Took a Leap's dairy goat herd. She was born at Took a Leap Farm on 17 June 2012 (one of the last kids born this year at the farm) and was five weeks old when the video was taken in July 2012. Her colour is described as \\"chamoisee with white belt\\". According to her owners, Buttermilk Sky is known for her energy; however, the kicking was a first-time occurrence, which was caught on video by chance. One of Buttermilk's owners commented that, before the video went viral, she had pledged to donate $25 to Farm Sanctuary, a not-for-profit animal welfare group, should it receive more than one thousand views. Afterwards, she suggested that a collaborative publicity campaign with Farm Sanctuary was being considered, to take advantage of the attention Buttermilk has received.

He left in 1999 shortly before a format change. = Sirius XM Satellite Radio = In late 2000, he accepted the position of program director at XM Satellite Radio where he began in early 2001.  Special X  It was at XM that Brutus began the genre bending Special X channel which mixed varied musical and spoken word formats into a bizarre amalgam known as Weirdness on Special X. Wired described the programming as, \\"Bizarre enough to make Dr. Demento woozy...a wild mix of wacky theme programming and 'categorically challenged' music.\\" Brutus appeared on channel in the character of Generalissimo \\"Stoshu\\" Ortega during vignettes produced to sound like Cold War era Communist propaganda broadcasts promoting weird music instead of politics. The other regular channel voice was actor Joe Turkel. Special X also hosted themed programming like the baseball-centric \\"Play Ball\\" and the novelty holiday Special X-Mas programming. For Valentine's Day it featured The One I Love Ripped Out My Heart and Fed it to a Pack of Wild Dogs Anti-Valentine's Day Spectacular. Additionally, the channel presented a two- hour daily program of strange cover songs entitled Cover Songs That Give You a Burning in Your Esophagus.  Fungus 53  When Special X was dropped from the line up in 2008, Brutus was tasked with creating the first ever punk rock radio station Fungus 53. Assistant programmer on the channel was DJ Russ Brown. The channel became respected enough for its support of the genre that it was celebrated by punk band NOFX in the song \\"Fungus\\".Fungus The song featured the lyrics, \\"I hate the radio but I like Fungus. The only punk-rock station, it's humongous. I think they just play Misfit's Walk among us. Fungus 53.\\"  Director of programming  After the punk rock format and channel were axed in 2008, Brutus was named as Senior Program Director of the Active Rock format. This has included working with Sirius XM Radio channels Octane, Liquid Metal, Rock Bar, Faction and The Grateful Dead Channel as well as creating the Mandatory Metallica limited run channel.  Artist Confidential Brutus became host for the Artist Confidential Series following the death of original host George Taylor Morris. The long form music and interview series put Brutus together with artists as diverse as James Taylor, Evanesence, KoRn, Hank Williams Jr., Smashing Pumpkins, Shinedown, Harry Connick Jr., Weezer, Cheap Trick, Indigo Girls, Snow Patrol, Reba McEntire, Fall Out Boy, Eddie Money, Wynonna, Megadeth, The Oak Ridge Boys, Graham Nash, David Gray, Chicago, George Thorogood, Testament, The Fray and many more. He has criticized the Rock Radio format in regard to its artists relations, \\"I believe the rock end of the business needs to get its act together much in the way that country did when it comes to making artists a more integral part of each radio station. Management and labels need to step up and make their artists available to the stations. On radio's end, you must do a great job every time an artist is taking time out of their probably already overworked schedule. We on the radio have got to make the artists feel like they have to be on the air with us or they're missing out on something. Both sides need to respect each other, help each other and feed off each other.\\" = Outside Endeavors = In 1992, Brutus began a series of comic books entitled \\"The Adventures of Brutusman.\\" The comics featured other personalities and characters from his radio show including Sammy the Seal. The comics were drawn by Alan MacBain. An online only version, meant to be downloaded and colored, was released in 2010 under the title \\"Brutusman: The Dark Nut Returns.\\" The comic was again drawn by MacBain and written by Brutus. Brutus has produced at least two micro-brewed beers including \\"Brew Loutus Ale\\" and \\"Lou-In-Brau.\\" They were produced thru local beer brewers in the Providence, RI and Chicago, IL areas. Label design for each beer was by Alan MacBain. Lou Brutus won the Radio Contraband Rock Radio Award for \\"Dj of the Year\\" for 2013 and 2014 for \\"Syndicated DJ of the Year\\" Music career= Dead Schembechlers = In 2004, Lou Brutus teamed with Colin Gawel and Joe Oestreich of the Columbus, OH based rock band Watershed to form the group Dead Schembechlers. The group took a satirical look at the football rivalry between Ohio State University and the University of Michigan, named the greatest sports rivalry of all time by ESPN. Named for former Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler, The Dead Schembechlers featured pro-OSU/anti-Michigan songs like \\"Michigan Stadium is A Pile of Shit,\\" Ann Arbor Girls Are Dirty Whores,\\" and \\"I Hate Michigan.\\" Full length albums from the group include \\"Rocket to Ann Arbor,\\" \\"Wolverine Destroyer,\\" and \\"Rodriguez to Ruin,\\" which also featured artwork by Alan MacBain. . Each band member took a first name of \\"Bo\\" and the last name of a famous punk rocker with Brutus becoming lead singer Bo Biafra, the last name a nod to Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. While finding an early champion in Columbus, OH radio station WWCD-FM, the group's no-holds barred approach immediately garnered negative press including the November 19, 2004 front page of the Detroit Free Press with the headline \\"OSU Punks Rip into U-M Rivals.\\" Brutus as Biafra appeared alongside footage of the band in the HBO documentary \\"Michigan vs Ohio State: The Rivalry\\" with one pro- Michigan reviewer calling his on camera appearance \\"awful.\\" The band announced their retirement following Bo Schembechler's death just a few hours before their 2006 \\"Hate Michigan Rally.\\" They have since sporadically reformed with proceeds going to the Bo Schembechler Heart of Champion Fund charity. = Grumpy Old Punks = Brutus joined with old school friends K Roy of the band Jehovah Waitresses and Guzda in 2011 for the band Grumpy Old Punks. Like the Dead Schembechlers, their music rooted in classic punk rock, with lyrics spoofing the problems of middle aged men. The band released the EP \\"Grumpy Old Punks\\" in 2011 and \\"Anarchy in the Prostate\\" in 2012. Artwork for both albums provided by underground cartoonist Derf. Song titles include \\"My Adjustable Rate Mortgage Sucks,\\" \\"That's No MILF That's My Wife,\\" and \\"Gotta Get A Nose Hair Trimmer.\\" References External links  Lou Brutus Links * Official \\"Lou Brutus\\" website Dead Schembechlers Links * Official \\"Dead Schembechlers\\" website Grumpy Old Punks Links * Official \\"Grumpy Old Punks\\" website hardDrive with Lou Bruts Links * Official \\"hardDrive with Lou Brutus\\" website Sirius XM Radio Links * Official \\"Sirius XM Radio\\" website Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:American radio personalities Category:Manalapan High School alumni Category:People from Englishtown, New Jersey Category:Musicians from Newark, New Jersey Category:Brookdale Community College alumni ","title":"Lou Brutus"},{"id":"38220452","text":"The Vangen Church near Mission Hill, South Dakota was built in 1896.

His many influences, from jazz to electronics, from American to French music, give him an unusual style, apart from the main trends of French contemporary music, combining energy and subtleness.Thion, Michel (1994). \\"La musique contemporaine en France en 1994\\", p. 67. Chroniques de l'AFAA n°5, AFAA, Paris. Contemporary Composers Index While rooted in electroacoustic music and its approach based on composing with sounds rather than notes, he also wrote many instrumental pieces and specialized particularly in music mixing live performers and electronics, whether fixed sound or live processing.Solomos, Makis (2000). \\"Die neuesten Entwicklungen der zeitgenössischen Musik in Frankreich\\", p.85-86. Musik und Aesthetik vol.4 n°16, Stuttgart At the basis of his work are the musical gesture and the life of sound and its morphology.Classical Composers Index An improviser himself, his works often leave a creative space for performers, and he has collaborated on many occasions with famous improvisers. Vérin received commissions from the French Ministry of Culture, Radio France, INA-GRM, Studios, Festivals and Conservatories. He was composer in residence in the Midi-Pyrénées region and was awarded the prize Villa Médicis hors les murs. His music, published by Éditions Jobert and Éditions François Dhalmann, has been performed and broadcast worldwide.  Life and work = Beginnings = Vérin was born 21 June 1958 in Saint-Omer, France. After initial studies with private professors of piano, at the Martenot School and the Brest Conservatory, he obtained his Diplôme de fin d’études from the Conservatoire National de Région de Saint- Maur in piano, studies in chamber music, harmony. At age 12 he started guitar and a year later founds and leads a pop music group. This was to be followed by jazz piano, which he learned mostly on his own, but also with teachers (Matias Pizarro, Jimmy Cheatham, François Couturier). After his baccalauréat, he followed a summer workshop in Cordes, near Toulouse, by INA-GRM, during which he decided to become an electroacoustic composer. He then studied music and science at the Universities of Paris VI-Jussieu, Brest and Paris VIII- Vincennes, where he obtained a licence de musique (B.A.).

Vérin went on to study 5 years at the University of California, San Diego, where he obtained a Master of Arts (1982)Master of Arts, UCSD and a PhD (1986)PhD Thesis, UCSD in composition and computer music. His main professors there were Roger Reynolds, Jean-Charles François, Joji Yuasa, Robert Erickson, F.

At its discovery, it was identified as the largest and the most massive known structure in the observable universe, though it has been superseded by the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall at 10 billion light-years. There are also issues about its structure (see Dispute section below). Discovery Roger G. Clowes, together with colleagues from the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, United Kingdom, has reported on January 11, 2013 a grouping of quasars within the vicinity of the constellation Leo. They used data from the DR7QSO catalogue of the comprehensive Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a major multi-imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey of the sky. They reported that the grouping was, as they announced, the largest known structure in the observable universe. The structure was initially discovered in November 2012 and took two months of verification before its announcement. News about the structure's announcement spread worldwide, and has received great attention on the scientific community. Characteristics The Huge-LQG was estimated to be about 1.24 Gpc in length, by 640 Mpc and 370 Mpc on the other dimensions, and contains 73 quasars, respectively. Quasars are very luminous active galactic nucleus, thought to be supermassive black holes feeding on matter. Since they are only found in dense regions of the universe, quasars can be used to find overdensities of matter within the universe. It has the approximate binding mass of 6.1 (6.1 trillion (long scale) or 6.1 quintillion (short scale)) . The Huge-LQG was initially named U1.27 due to its average redshift of 1.27 (where the \\"U\\" refers to a connected unit of quasars), placing its distance at about 9 billion light-years from Earth. The Huge-LQG is 615Mpc from the Clowes–Campusano LQG (U1.28), a group of 34 quasars also discovered by Clowes in 1991. Cosmological principle In Clowes' initial announcement of the structure, he has reported that the structure has contradicted the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle implies that at sufficiently large scales, the universe is approximately homogeneous, meaning that the statistical fluctuations in quantities such as the matter density between different regions of the universe are small. However, different definitions exist for the homogeneity scale above which these fluctuations may be considered sufficiently small, and the appropriate definition depends on the context in which it is used. Jaswant Yadav et al. have suggested a definition of the homogeneity scale based on the fractal dimension of the universe; they conclude that, according to this definition, an upper limit for the homogeneity scale in the universe is 260/h Mpc. Some studies that have attempted to measure the homogeneity scale according to this definition have found values in the range 70–130/h Mpc.Nadathur, Seshadri, (July 2013) \\"Seeing patterns in noise: gigaparsec-scale 'structures' that do not violate homogeneity\\". Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in press. arXiv:1306.1700. Bibcode: 2013MNRAS.tmp.1690N The Sloan Great Wall, discovered in 2003, has a length of 423Mpc, which is marginally larger than the homogeneity scale as defined above. The Huge-LQG is three times longer than, and twice as wide as the Yadav et al. upper limit to the homogeneity scale, and has therefore been claimed to challenge our understanding of the universe on large scales. However, due to the existence of long-range correlations, it is known that structures can be found in the distribution of galaxies in the universe that extend over scales larger than the homogeneity scale. Dispute Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Bielefeld has conducted an even more comprehensive study of the Huge-LQG. After a more detailed study, he announced that contrary to the claim by Clowes about a large clustering, his new map has shown that there is no clear clustering of quasars within the vicinity of the Huge-LQG. The map was actually similar to the one produced by Clowes (see above section) - with the difference that Nadathur's map included all the quasars in that region. After performing a number of statistical analyses on the quasar data, and finding extreme changes in the Huge-LQG membership and shape with small changes in the cluster finding parameters, he determined the probability that apparent clusters the size of the Huge-LQG would appear in a random assortment of quasars. He set up 10,000 regions identical in size to that studied by Clowes, and filled them with randomly distributed quasars with the same position statistics as did the actual quasars in the sky. The data is supporting the study of the homogeneity scale by Yadav et al., and that there is, therefore, no challenge to the cosmological principle. The study also implies that the statistical algorithm used by Clowes to identify the Huge-LQG, when used to correlate other quasars in the sky, produces more than a thousand clusterings identical to the Huge- LQG. While quasars can represent dense regions of the universe, one must note that all of the quasars in the sky are evenly distributed, that is, one quasar per few million light years, making their significance as a structure very unlikely. The identification of the Huge-LQG, together with the clusterings identified by Nadathur, is therefore referred to be false positive identifications or errors in identifying structures, finally arriving at the conclusion that the Huge-LQG is not a real structure at all. Several questions arose from the structure's discovery. But it is not told how Clowes detected a clustering of quasars in the region, nor how he found any correlation of quasars in the region. It is specified, that, not only the structure but also other LQGs are not real structures at all. Nevertheless, Clowes et al. found independent support for the reality of the structure from its coincidence with Mg II absorbers (once-ionised magnesium gas, commonly used to probe distant galaxies). The Mg II gas suggests that the Huge-LQG is associated with an enhancement of the mass, rather than being a false positive. This point is not discussed by the critical paper. Further support for the reality of the Huge- LQG comes from the work of Hutsemékers et al. in September 2014. They measured the polarization of quasars in the Huge-LQG and found \\"a remarkable correlation\\" of the polarization vectors on scales larger than 500 Mpc.

The not-for-profit institute aims to identify and train persons who have had to face adverse social conditions including physical disabilities, poverty, war strife . Its original official name was \\"International Institute for Social Entrepreneurship\\". However, to avoid the common notion of monetary gains with the usage of word 'entrepreneurship', the founders are renaming the project as kanthari international. The initial lower case letters used in the name are intentionally kept as a symbol of their ideology. kanthari, the word 'kanthari' (Malayalam: കാന്താരി) is the name of a pepper chilly that is indigenous to the land of Kerala state, India. Kanthari is known for its extreme hotness despite the small size. According to Sabriye, the head of the institute, the spice is very representative of the 'small' people who in fact, with the right motivation and preparation, can bring in a drastic and innovative change within the society. As a symbol of the institute's deterrence to prejudices and normally accepted conventions, kanthari international is spelt and written with all letters in lowercase.

It trains its participants in skills like management, public speaking, communication, leadership, fund raising, budgeting, bookkeeping, marketing and computer usage. The program takes 11 months. Impact of kanthari Jane Waithera is from Kenya. Jane is a person living with Albinism{Albinism is a defect of melanin production that results in little or no color (pigment) in the skin, hair, and eyes}. This means that she lacks melanin and her skin is white. In east Africa it is believed that possessing a body part of an Albino brings good luck. Therefore Albinos are killed and their body parts sold for a high price. Jane is a 2009 kanthari graduate. Since her return home she has been fighting for the rights of Albinos. Over the past five years we trained 98 participants from 35 countries. The graduates have started over 65 projects and initiatives and reach thousands of beneficiaries.

He also studied protest folk songs in Australia.Australian Folksongs and Ballads, Smithsonian Folkways, 1959 He recorded The Great American Bum and Other Hobo and Migratory Workers' Songs, and American Industrial Folksongs, both released by Riverside Records. In the 1950s he was a Professor of English at University of Denver. He was professor of anthropology in the late 1960s through the 1970s at the University of Colorado in Boulder, at times angering the establishment there. During this time he wrote prolifically for conservative magazine The National Review. His columns remain highly controversial; after a 1969 column in defense of the genocide of Native Americans (in which he wrote, “Did the United States destroy the American Indian? No, but it should have.”), he responded to Native critics in a mock-pidgin dialect, saying that the “[C]hicken tracks of red brother ... makeum paleface heart heavy.” He authored or edited 19 books, wrote hundreds of articles and reviews, and was for many years editor of the Journal of American Folklore, Southwestern Lore, and Western Folklore (acting). Other popular works by Greenway include The Inevitable Americans (1964) and Literature Among the Primitives (1964). Many consider his best work to be Down Among the Wild Men, an account of his studies among the Aborigines of Australia, a people he greatly admired, and indeed found to be superior to the decadent white man of the Western world.

Most cultivated bananas and plantains are triploid cultivars either of this hybrid or of M. acuminata alone. Linnaeus originally used the name M. paradisiaca only for plantains or cooking bananas, but the modern usage includes hybrid cultivars used both for cooking and as dessert bananas. Linnaeus's name for dessert bananas, Musa sapientum, is thus a synonym of Musa × paradisiaca. Description Almost all cultivated plantains and many cultivated bananas are triploid cultivars of M. × paradisiaca. It is believed that Southeast Asian farmers first domesticated M. acuminata. When the cultivated plants spread north-west into areas where M. balbisiana was native (see map), hybrids between the two species occurred and were then developed further into a wide range of cultivars. Hundreds of cultivars of M. × paradisiaca are known, possessing characteristics that are highly variable, but broadly intermediate between the ancestral species. They are typically tall when mature. The above-ground part of the plant is a \\"false stem\\" or pseudostem, consisting of leaves and their fused bases. Each pseudostem can produce a single flowering stem. After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots may develop from the base of the plant. Cultivars of M. × paradisiaca are usually sterile, without seeds or viable pollen. Taxonomy Banana plants were originally classified by Linnaeus into two species, which he called Musa paradisiaca for those used as cooking bananas (plantains), and M. sapientum for those used as dessert bananas. It was later discovered that both of his \\"species\\" were actually cultivated varieties of the hybrid between two wild species, M. acuminata and M. balbisiana, which is now called M. × paradisiaca L. The circumscription of the modern taxon M. × paradisiaca thus includes both the original M. paradisiaca and M. sapientum, the latter being reduced to a synonym of M. × paradisiaca. In pre-Linnean times this banana was named 'Musa serapionis', for instance by Maria Sybilla Merian in her Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium of 1705. (plate 12). See also: At one time, to deal with the great diversity of cultivated bananas and plantains, botanists created many other names which are now regarded as synonyms of M. × paradisiaca, such as M. corniculata Lour., used for a group of plantains with large fruit resembling the horns of a bull. Cultivated varieties are now given cultivar names, with the cultivars classified into groups and subgroups. Thus M. × paradisiaca 'Horn' is a cultivar belonging to the AAB genome group, Plantain subgroup. See List of banana cultivars for further information on the naming and classification of cultivars.

Career=National team= He achieved regional success with the team in the 2001 when he led his team to a win in the East and Central African Championship. Because of their success in 2001 with Asrat Haile at the helm, Ethiopia jumped 17 spots in FIFA rankings to 138th. However, the EFF chose to look for a new manager and signed German coach Jochen Figge in August 2002. Asrat remained as assistant coach. He began to loss of popularity among the fans during this time as he was blamed for the team's failures in 2002 under coach Figge; especially for their abysmal performance at 2002 CECAFA cup in which the \\"Walya Antelopes\\" lost all four games in Group B. In May 2003, Asrat was nonetheless re-appointed to the position interim head coach after the dismissal of Figge for allegedly failing to provide the proper documents for the position. In his second short tenure as manager, Ethiopia failed to qualify to the 2004 African Cup of Nations, extending to 22 years their streak of no appearances at the continental tournament. In September 2003, Asrat was replaced by Seyoum Kebede as new permanent head coach. However, Seyoum's stay with the team was not much longer than Figge's. In December 2004, Asrat was again appointed manager of the Walya Antelopes just two weeks before the 2004 CECAFA Cup. He led Ethiopia as they won the tournament for the second time under his stewardship and for the third time in Ethiopian football history. However, he announced immediately after the tournament that he would be resigning as coach. He said: \\"I wouldn't accept any contract offer from the EFF to coach the national [team].\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:Ethiopian football managers ","title":"Asrat Haile"},{"id":"38220808","text":"Bend Radio Group is a local radio station company located in the Bend, Oregon.

Norell (born July 26, 1957) is an American paleontologist and molecular geneticist, acknowledged as one of the most important living vertebrate paleontologists. He is currently the chairman of paleontology and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History. He is best known as the discoverer of the first theropod embryo and for the description of feathered dinosaurs. Norell is credited with the naming of the genera Apsaravis, Byronosaurus, Citipati, Tsaagan, and Achillobator. His work regularly appears in major scientific journals (including cover stories in Science and Nature) and was listed by Time magazine as one of the ten most significant science stories of 1993, 1994 and 1996. Norell is both a fellow of the Explorer's Club and the Willi Hennig Society. Career Norell's research has encompassed a number of different areas, from the theoretical study of diversity through time, and his doctoral thesis of the evolutionary variations in maize. Following his M.S. at San Diego, Norell published papers on the efficacy of the fossil record in capturing phylogenetic history, and how missing data can influence the estimation of phylogeny. Norell became a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in 1990 and helped oversee the renovation of the Halls of Vertebrate Evolution. The organization, where visitors progress in a circular motion around the floor, mirrors the evolutionary patterns of a phylogenetic tree. Thus, guests begin their exploration with the simplest vertebrates, placoderms and bony fishes, and conclude their visit with advanced mammals, such as mammoths and artiodactyls. Currently, Norell studies relationships of small carnivorous dinosaurs to modern birds and develops new ways of observing fossils through CT scans and imaging computers. He has led over twenty international paleontological expeditions, in locales such as Patagonia, Cuba, the Chilean Andes, the Sahara and West Africa. The famous Mongolia project, which has delivered numerous discoveries in vertebrate evolution, has received world-wide attention. Notable discoveries Mark Norell is the direct discoverer of the enigmatic theropod Shuvuuia, co-led the group that discovered Ukhaa Tolgod, the richest Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrate fossil locality in the world, discovered the first embryo of a theropod dinosaur, described a series of dinosaurs with feathers, and discovered the first direct evidence of dinosaur brooding. Norell's theoretical work has a focus of data evaluation in large cladistic sets, as well as fossil pattern estimation through phylogeny, in order to see trends in diversity and extinction. He has authored several papers that discuss the relationship between stratigraphic position and phylogenetic topology. Honors and distinctions In 1998, Norell was named a New York City Leader of the Year by the New York Times. In 2000, he was honored as a distinguished Alumnus of California State University Long Beach. His popular science book, Discovering Dinosaurs, won Scientific American's Young Readers Book of the Year Award. Another of his books for the general public, entitled A Nest of Dinosaurs, was given an Orbis Pictus Award by the National Council of Teachers.  Dinosaur Hunters  Dinosaur Hunters (1996, written and directed by Kage Glantz credited as Kage Kleiner, narrated by Michael Carroll) is a National Geographic documentary about the 1990s AMNH expeditions led in Mongolia, in the Gobi Desert, by paleontologists Mike Novacek and Mark Norell.

She was the first subject of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, the longest-running study of a land mammal. The study of Echo and her family contributed significantly to the understanding of elephants, including their life-cycles, methods of communication, emotional lives, and cooperative care of the young. Echo died at the age of 65, in 2009. History Echo was named after the radio collar that Cynthia Moss fitted her with in 1973, the year Moss began tracking her. Echo became a matriarch at the age of 23. Elephant matriarchs make life and death decisions on behalf of their extended family, such as when to leave a drought area, where to go, and when to leave an injured family member. It is unusual for a 23-year-old elephant to become a matriarch. Echo had at least eight calves, facilitating Moss' ability to document elephant cooperative care of young. In 1990, Echo gave birth to Ely, who provided a case-study for the emotional connections between family members. The large calf had become cramped in the womb during the 22-month pregnancy and was born with rigid carpal joints, making it almost impossible for him to walk. The condition made it a substantial risk for the herd to care for him, as they were forced to forgo food to do so. Nonetheless, the herd stayed with Ely for many days, until he was better able to walk. Ely provided scientists with additional evidence of elephant emotional bonds when he was wounded by a spear at the age of seventeen. Veterinarians attempted to tranquilize him, but were initially chased off by Echo and several other family members. Moss relates that gunshots fired over their heads did not deter the family from trying to protect Ely. Neither did Echo's need to care for a new calf. Ely was eventually treated by the veterinary team and survived.Moss, Cynthia, \\"A Passionate Devotion\\", Armstrong, S & Botzler, R.G., An Animal Ethics Reader, Routledge, 2003, p. 101. Biologist Marc Bekoff advances these examples of Echo's behavior to argue that elephants have complex emotional lives, and their families should not be broken up for zoos and circuses. Echo's family, now led by Ella, continues to be a primary research subject of the Amboseli researchers. Echo was the subject of several documentaries by PBS and the BBC. Cynthia Moss has written several books about her and her extended family, including Echo of the Elephants: The Story of an Elephant Family and Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family.

Borelli, , 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, was a California Superior Court Case from 1992 involving the enforcement of a contract. Background Borelli was the wife to an ill and dying man. They had a prenuptial agreement, but when the man fell into a worse state of sickness he agreed give more of his estate directly to his wife. After a stroke, he refused to be put in a hospital or special facility. His wife agreed to take care of him at home if he would agree to give her the title to certain real property. Shortly after, he died without making a change to his will. Brusseau, the executor of his will, refused to give Borelli the property she claimed. Borelli brought a legal suit against Brusseau and demanded that the court mandate him to bequeath the estate, but was ruled against. She subsequently appealed. Case The court considered if such a contract, one spouse helping another in time of illness in exchange for title to property, violated public law. The court determined that spouses have an automatic duty to care for each other in times of illness, without need of special contracts. They believed that a spousal agreement that mandated such an arrangement would be contrary to public policy. Borelli claimed that if it were not for the agreement she would have likely left him in his illness. There was a minority dissenting opinion of the court that believed that spouses did not have such duty of care and should be allowed to enter into contracts as if they were not spouses. Decision The court ruled that the contract in question did violate public policy and was therefore unenforceable. Brusseau was not compelled to transfer title of the property to Borelli. Importance Spouses cannot enter into similar contracts like so since, as spouses, they already have certain duties to each other. Such contracts violate public law on marriage contracts. In order for title of property to properly pass from one spouse to another in similar situations, it must be expressly written into a will or other document stating intent.

For daylight photography, there is a similar rule called the Sunny 16 rule. The basic rule is: \\"For astronomical photos of the Moon's surface, set aperture to and shutter speed to the [reciprocal of the] ISO film speed [or ISO setting].\\" * With ISO 100, the photographer should set the shutter speed to 1/100 or 1/125 second. (On some cameras, 1/125 second is the available setting nearest to 1/100 second.) * With ISO 200, set it to 1/200 or 1/250 second. * With ISO 400, set it to 1/400 or 1/500 second. As with other light readings, shutter speed can be changed as long as the f-number is altered to compensate, e.g. 1/250 second at f/8 gives equivalent exposure to 1/125 second at f/11. Generally, the adjustment is done such that for each step in aperture increase (i.e., decreasing the f-number), the exposure time has to be halved (or equivalently, the shutter speed doubled), and vice versa. This follows the more general rule derived from the mathematical relationship between aperture and exposure time—within reasonable ranges, exposure is proportional to the square of the aperture ratio and proportional to exposure time; thus, to maintain a constant level of exposure, a change in aperture by a factor c requires a change in exposure time by a factor 1/c² and vice versa. Steps in aperture correspond to a factor close to the square root of two, thus the above rule. The intensity of visible sunlight striking the surface of the Moon is essentially the same as at the surface of the Earth. The albedo of the Moon's surface material is lower (darker) than that of the Earth's surface, and the Looney 11 rule increases exposure by one stop versus the Sunny 16 rule. Many photographers simply use the f/16-based Sunny 16 rule, unmodified, for lunar photographs.

BackgroundHistory=Early cooperation with Turkish revolutionaries= The Ottoman government was party to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed between the Bolshevik government of Russia and the Central Powers on March 3, 1918; the treaty became obsolete later the same year. Russian Bolsheviks and the Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin, who emerged victorious from the Russian Civil War by 1921, viewed the Turkish revolutionary (national) movement under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal as congenial to their ideological and geopolitical aspirations. The Lenin government abdicated the traditional claims of the Russian Empire to the territories of Western Armenia and the Turkish Straits. The Soviet supply of gold and armaments to the Kemalists in 1920–1922 was a key factor in the latter's successful grab of power in an Ottoman Empire defeated by the Triple Entente and their victory in the Armenian campaign and the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).В. Шеремет. Босфор. Moscow, 1995, p. 241. Russian Embassy in Istanbul. Ottoman postcard The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the first state to formally recognize the Kemalist government of Turkey in March 1921 which signed the Treaty of Alexandropol with the Turkish revolutionaries on 2 December 1920. The Treaty of Moscow signed on 16 March 1921 between the RSFSR's Lenin government and the government of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (the Sultanate was still nominally in existence) followed bilateral treaties that the Moscow government concluded with Persia and Afghanistan earlier the same year (apart from those with the states on the territory of the former Russian Empire); on the same day, in London, the RSFSR signed a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which was hailed as \\"of principal consequence\\" by the Pravda newspaper.Pravda. 20 March 1921, № 60, p. 1. =Treaties of trade and cooperation= Under the 1921 Treaty of Moscow,Документы внешней политики СССР. Moscow, 1959, Vol. III, pp. 597-604. the two governments undertook to establish friendly relations between the countries; under Article II, Turkey ceded Batum and the adjacent area North of the village of Sarp to Georgia (Kars Oblast went to Turkey); Article III instituted an autonomous Nakhchivan oblast under Azerbaijan's protectorate; under Article V, the parties agreed to delegate the final elaboration of the status of the Black Sea and the Straits to a future conference of delegates of the littoral states, provided that the \\"full sovereignty\\" and security of Turkey and \\"her capital city of Constantinople\\" are not injured. The Treaty of Moscow was followed by an identical Treaty of Kars signed in October 1921 by the Kemalists with Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan and Soviet Georgia, which formed part of the Soviet Union after the December 1922 Union Treaty. The GNAT diplomatic note dated October 24, 1922, demanded that the Russian government terminate the operations by the Soviet Trade mission in Turkey until a trade agreement was signed;Документы вешней политики СССР. Moscow, 1961, Vol. V, pp. 635-636. such agreement was concluded on March 11, 1927.Документы вешней политики СССР. Moscow, 1961, Vol. V, pp. 763.

ОГИЗ, 1947, Vol. III, p. 146. When the Turkish government enquired on what conditions a new agreement could be concluded, it was informed by Molotov that in addition to bases in the Straits, the Soviet Union claimed a part of eastern Turkey, which was assumed to refer to the districts of Kars, Artvin and Ardahan, which the Russian Empire (and the short-lived DRA) had held between 1878 and 1921.Mango, Andrew.

ОГИЗ, 1947, Vol. III, p. 545. =Turkish alignment with NATO= At the Potsdam Conference (July 1945), Stalin demanded a revision of the Montreux Convention; Britain and the U.S. agreed with the Soviet demand that the Straits should always be open to the warships of the Black Sea powers and, in principle, remain closed to those of outside powers, but further Soviet demand that the Soviet Union should be allowed to join in the defence of the Straits was rejected by Turkey, with the backing of the West. In March 1947, with the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine, the U.S. underwrote the frontiers of Turkey (as well as Greece) and the continued existence of non-communist governments in the two countries. Turkey sought aid from the United States and joined NATO in 1952. The USSR and Turkey were in different camps during the Korean War and throughout the Cold War.

When every attempt failed and he ended up in an accident, he gained the assistance of Power Broker. Mister Negative approached him and offered him a job in his criminal organization.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #39. Marvel Comics. Overdrive was hired by Mister Negative to steal an artifact from a museum, but was unable to deliver it because of interference from Spider-Man. Overdrive led Spider-Man on a high-speed chase through the streets of Manhattan. When Spider-Man smashed the windshield of Overdrive's car, it revealed dozens of pieces of Spider-Man-related merchandise such as bobble-heads, air-fresheners, and action figures. Overdrive declared that he was Spider-Man's \\"biggest fan\\", even asking for an autograph as Spider-Man was trying to stop him.The Amazing Spider-Man: Swing Shift. Marvel Comics. The chase finally culminated in a car- wreck that had Overdrive and his vehicle hanging from a bridge in New York by Spider-Man's webbing with Spider-Man's trademark note, \\"Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\\". Overdrive asked the police who were on the scene to arrest him if he could keep the note. Overdrive was then sent by Mister Negative to steal the Sonic Pulse Generator from a laboratory but he failed again when he met Spider-Man once again. Mister Negative told his men to dispose of Overdrive and they put him in the trunk of Mister Negative's limo and Overdrive was able to escape them by converting the limo into one of his \\"tricked out\\" cars.The Amazing Spider-Man #642.

Powers and abilities Overdrive scatters nanites by touch which can transform a vehicle to his will such as improving a car's speed or design. These changes will revert if Overdrive is away from the vehicle for too long. In other media Overdrive appears in the 2017 Spider-Man animated series episode \\"Bring on the Bad Guys\\" Pt. 1, voiced by Ryan Blaney. He is one of several supervillains that attempt to claim a bounty on Spider-Man. Overdrive in particular lured him out by using his nanites on a bus, trapping him, and taking his glove. However, Spider-Man finds a nanite sample and uses it to power his Uncle Ben's motorcycle. When Overdrive returns to kidnap Spider-Man, the latter challenges him to a motorcycle race and uses a virus to stop the former's nanites before subduing him and leaving him for the police. A female Marvel 2099 version of Overdrive appears in the Nintendo DS version of the video game, Spider-Man: Edge of Time, voiced by Kari Wahlgren. She wears a nanite-based costume and is also much more competent than her mainstream counterpart, claiming she only commits crimes for the speed.

Academic background  After attending the from 1833 to 1838, Schaefer studied philology and history at the University of Leipzig. His teachers included Moritz Haupt (1808–1874), Gottfried Hermann (1772–1848) and Wilhelm Wachsmuth (1784-1866). After his graduation, Schaefer initially attempted a habilitation project on Old High German, supervised by Moritz Haupt. Due to a favourable job offer from the educationalist Karl Justus Blochmann (1786–1855) Schaefer was persuaded to relocate to Dresden, where he subsequently taught classes in history and ancient languages at the . Schaefer was already producing a large number of publications at this time, including the school textbook Commentatio de libro vitarum decem oratorum (Commentary on the Book of the Lives of the Ten Orators, 1844) and Geschichtstabellen zum Auswendiglernen (Historical tables for memorisation, 1847), a practical handbook for students, which contained important dates in world history from antiquity to his own day, divided into three sections: general history, epochal history, and cultural history. By 1888 it had been through 17 editions, the last two of which (1885 and 1888) were edited by Schaefer's colleague Julius Asbach. In 1851, Schaefer was appointed to the Gymnasium St. Augustine in Grimma. There he completed the first two volumes of his three volume work Demosthenes und seine Zeit (Demosthenes and his Time, 1856-1858), on which he had been working for ten years. His valedictory speech at the school discussed Demosthenes' On the Crown. On 30 November 1857, Schaefer became an ordinary professor of history at the University of Greifswald. In his lectures and seminars (for the university's history department, which he founded in 1863),Niels Hegewisch, Karl-Heinz Spieß, Thomas Stamm-Kuhlmann: Geschichtswissenschaft in Greifswald. Festschrift zum 150jährigen Bestehen des Historischen Instituts der Universität Greifswald (Beiträge zur Geschichte der Universität Greifswald, vol. 11). Steiner, Stuttgart 2015, . Schaefer dealt with all periods and fields of history, but with a focus on Roman history and the modern history of Prussia. He maintained friendly links with colleagues in various fields, including the economist , the archaeologist Adolf Michaelis, and the philologists Martin Hertz, Georg Friedrich Schömann, and Hermann Usener. He refused a post at the University of Königsberg in 1863, to fill the vacancy left by Wilhelm von Giesebrecht's departure.Michael Czolkoß: Studien zur Geschichte der Geschichtswissenschaft. Die Universität Greifswald in der preußischen Hochschullandschaft (1830-1865). Marburg 2015. In the summer of 1865, Schaefer moved to the University of Bonn, where he held the Chair of History until his death in 1883.Michael Czolkoß: Studien zur Geschichte der Geschichtswissenschaft. Die Universität Greifswald in der preußischen Hochschullandschaft (1830-1865). Marburg 2015. Paul Egon Hübinger: Das Historische Seminar der Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universität zu Bonn (Bonner Historische Forschungen, Bd. 20). Bonn 1963. The faculty of history was established at the same time; before this all professors of history had been part of the philology faculty. In the academic year 1871/72, Schaefer served as rector of the university. In Bonn, Schaefer continued his lectures from Greidswald. Source criticism of Greek and Roman historical texts formed an important part of his lessons, forming the foundations for his publication in 1867 of Abriß der Quellenkunde der griechischen Geschichte bis auf Polybios (Outline of Source Criticism of Greek History up to Polybios). A second volume of the work was published shortly before his death under the title Abriß der Quellenkunde der griechischen und römischen Geschichte (Outline of Source Criticism of Greek and Roman History, 1883). His successor, Heinrich Nissen produced a second edition of this work in 1885, which itself received a second printing in 1867.Paul Egon Hübinger: Das Historische Seminar der Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Bonn (Bonner Historische Forschungen, Bd. 20). Bonn 1963. The studies of Prussian history which Schaefer had begun in Greifswald intensified in Bonn. He published the Geschichte des siebenjährigen Kriegs (History of the Seven Years' War) in three volumes between 1867 and 1874. The work was praised by the domestic and foreign press for his novel depiction of the operations. Shortly after the publication of the final volume, Schaefer undertook an extended educational tour of Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, and Italy. In 1879, he visited Rome for the celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Archaeological Institute there, and in 1880 he visited the Peloponnese, spending a great deal of time in Olympia. On the return journey he was struck by a severe bout of rheumatism, from which he recovered by a trip to a health spa. A few weeks after his return from the health spa, on 19 November 1883, Schaefer unexpectedly died at work from a stroke. His grave is in the Alter Friedhof. In his final years, Schaefer had been working on a new edition of his work on Demosthenes, to take account of the numerous papyrus finds and textual emendations that had occurred in the thirty years since the publication of the original work. The work was completed by Max Hoffmann and it appeared in three volumes, shortly after his death (1885-1887). In 1894, Schaefer's widow, Eugenie Schaefer née Großmann (daughter of the theologian Christian Gottlob Großmann) donated 100,000 marks to found the \\"Arnold- Schäfer-Fund\\" to support students and young scholars at the University of Bonn, which is still active today.  Selected works  Largely known for his writings on ancient Greek and Roman history, Schaefer also made contributions in studies involving the history of Prussia. The following are a few of his principal works: * Geschichtstabellen zum Auswendiglernen (1847) - Historical Tables for Memorization (Online) * Demosthenes und seine Zeit (1856–58) - Demosthenes and his Times. * De ephoris Lacedaemoniis (1863) - On the Spartan ephors * Disputatio de rerum post bellum Persicum usque ad tricennale foedus in Graecia gestarum temporibus (1865) - Computation of the Dates of Events in Greece from the Persian War until the Thirty Years' Peace * Abriß der Quellenkunde der griechischen Geschichte bis auf Polybios (1867) - Outline of Source Criticism of Greek History up to Polybios. * Geschichte des siebenjährigen Kriegs (1867–74), three volumes - History of the Seven Years' War. * Abriß der Quellenkunde der griechischen und römischen Geschichte (1883) - Outline of Source Criticism of Greek and Roman History.

Several national governments also supported the effort, mostly behind the scenes.

On the ground CRS coordinated with the well positioned and established missionary priests and sisters particularly the Holy Spirit Fathers from Ireland to pull together the highly effective distribution and services on the ground. This led to a ban by the Federal Military Government on aid flights into the region.

Raised in Hackensack, New Jersey, she earned her PhD in the origins and religious thought of Christianity from the University of Pennsylvania. In the 1970s, McKenna began participating in non-violent civil disobedience with the Plowshares Movement, sometimes being arrested or imprisoned for her actions. Her activism has continued through recent years. In 1989, McKenna helped to found New Jerusalem Laura, a North Philadelphia addiction treatment center that strives to help people recover from substance abuse without the use of medication, by substituting community service, discussion, and Bible study as routes to recovery. Early life and education McKenna grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey and upon graduating from high school entered the Medical Mission Sisters, a Catholic Church organization of women dedicated to improving world access to health care. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Chestnut Hill College, then a small Catholic women's college, and a master's degree in liturgy from Notre Dame University before moving on to the University of Pennsylvania and earning a doctorate in Christian origins and religious thought. For her doctorate thesis, she traveled to Israel for the clarity and solitude. Activism McKenna has been arrested for several acts of civil disobedience since becoming an activist in the 1970s. In 1987, she participated in a protest over the Iran–Contra affair during the bicentennial celebration of the signing of the constitution in Philadelphia. In 1988 on Easter Sunday, McKenna and three other Plowshares activists accessed the third deck of the and symbolically hammered on empty Tomahawk missile housings before pouring their own blood on them. At the same time, a banner that read \\"Follow the nonviolent Christ\\" was placed on the side of the ship. The group was charged with trespassing, and McKenna was sentenced to four months in prison. In 2007, McKenna, as well as musician Aaron Weiss, was arrested for participating in a \\"die-in\\" to protest the civilian casualties of the Iraq War on the grounds of The Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. This event was referenced in the song \\"Timothy Hay\\" by Weiss's band, mewithoutYou, on their album It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright. New Jerusalem Laura McKenna and modern-day hermit Richard Withers, who were both passionate about Desert Fathers then, asked themselves, \\"Where is the desert today?\\" After concluding that \\"the desert\\" was the inner cities, in 1989, they moved to the Fox Chase neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia. There, they witnessed the impact of drug addiction on the lives of the residents. In reaction, McKenna and Withers founded New Jerusalem Laura in an attempt to treat drug and alcohol addiction. In addition to New Jerusalem, McKenna helped set up the Peacemakers Reflection Center and the Alternate to Violence Project in her community. New Jerusalem Laura's addict counseling methods were influenced by those of One Day at a Time, founded by the Rev. Henry Wells. For the first 60 days of their stay, recovering addicts are prohibited from contacting the outside world, must surrender their cigarettes, and must be escorted if they leave the building. During this time, residents occupy their time with chores, community service, meetings, and Bible studies. Less than half of all people who enter the program remain after the first 60 days. After the first 60 days, residents' actions are less tightly restricted; however, they are still required to participate in the chores, Bible studies, and meetings. Residents graduate from the program after six months. McKenna believes that the reason for the New Jerusalem Laura's success is the community. \\"In a recovery community, you can't get away with [lying], because it shows,\\" she said. \\"It forces you to be honest.\\" Nearly 400 residents have graduated from the program since its inception.

It dates back to the Late Cretaceous and its fossilised remains were found in fish-rich fossil deposits in Lebanon. Description The fossilised remains of Cheirothrix lewisii were found in limestone strata in Lebanon dating back about 99 million years. This fish was first described by James William Davis in 1887 and was named in honour of Professor E. R. Lewis of the American College in Beirut. Professor Lewis had originally found the fossil at Sahel Alma on Mount Lebanon. In this famous fossil location, about sixty species of fish have been found, none of them known from elsewhere in the world. Cheirothrix lewisii is characterized by enormous pectoral fins and the ventral lobe of the tail fin is also much enlarged. It seems likely that these fish could launch themselves out of the water and glide hundreds of metres (yards) through the air, probably to evade predators. Distribution During the Cretaceous era, sea levels were much higher than they are now. The fish remains at Sahel Alma are very well preserved. The rock is a fine-grained limestone found in an area much folded and faulted and is laid down in thick beds. The fish may have died because of a localized shortage of oxygen. Five specimens of Cheirothrix lewisii were found, each preserved in such detail that the fifty or so vertebrae can be counted and the branching rays of the pectoral fins can be seen clearly. The holotype is a cleft slab of limestone with remains of the fish on both sides. It is now kept in the Natural History Museum in London. Another member of the genus, Cheirothrix libanicus, is found in the same fossil bed and other members of the genus are known from 84-million-year-old deposits in Germany.

He is a two-time Olympian, and a multiple-time Czech national record holder for the butterfly events (50, 100, and 200 m). Rubacek made his first Czech team, as a 17-year-old, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he competed only in butterfly and relay freestyle events. He also joined with his fellow swimmers Květoslav Svoboda, Josef Horký, and Martin Škacha in the men's 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. Swimming the lead-off leg, Rubacek recorded a split of 1:51.37, and the Czech team went on to finish heat two in seventh place and thirtieth overall, for a total time of 7:26.26. Few days later, Rubacek won the second heat of the men's 100 m butterfly by approximately one second ahead of Uzbekistan's Oleg Lyashko, with a time of 54.87 seconds. Finishing only in thirty-ninth place, Rubacek failed to qualify for the semifinals. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Rubacek qualified for the second time in the men's 100 m butterfly, by clearing a FINA B-cut of 53.71 from the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands. He challenged seven other swimmers in the fourth heat, including three-time Olympians Ioan Gherghel of Romania and Juan Veloz of Mexico. Rubacek raced to fourth place by five hundredths of a second (0.05) ahead of Veloz, breaking a new Czech record of 53.53 seconds. Rubacek failed to advance into the semifinals, as he placed forty-second out of 66 swimmers in the preliminaries. At the 2009 FINA World Championships in Rome, Italy, Rubacek dipped under a 52-second barrier, and lowered his record to 51.99 seconds in the preliminary heats of the 100 m butterfly. Few weeks later, he won a bronze medal in the same stroke at the Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia, posting his time at 52.33 seconds.

(Entry retrieved 15 January 2013) History The band has its origins in contacts made between Fernando Vial, Jorge Madueño and Alvaro Carrillo, when the latter two answered an ad placed in Segunda Mano (\\"Second Hand\\") magazine by Vial in late 1983. Carrillo later brought along a friend, Luis Piccini, who had a drum set. They originally named themselves \\"Los Descartables\\" (The Disposables or The Throw-Aways), and later \\"Los Descartados\\" (The Thrown-Away). Madueño soon took over as drummer, as Piccini was too often unavailable for practice as he had a girlfriend.\\"Narcosis\\" by Fernando Vial, in booklet accompanying Narcosis: Tributo CD (Pasajeros del Horror, Lima, 2004) The band then settled on the name Narcosis, which Vial has said was taken from the novel Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse Narcosis' first gig was played at the Carnaby bar, where they filled the bill alongside now-classic Lima rock bands LeuZemia and Masacre, on October 6, 1984. Not long after that, the band was booked for another gig, this time at the Palizada Pub, but found itself short of a vocalist as Carrillo had left the group. Vial has said that Carrillo left the band due \\"reasons of fate\\", but elsewhere it has been suggested that part of the reason was that he and Carrillo had had difficulties. The spot was filled by Luís \\"Wicho\\" García, who was a friend of Vial's, and the band's final line-up was established. Narcosis started practicing more, and writing their own music. In February 1985, they recorded their first album, Primera Dosis, in Madueño's living room using a portable 4-track tape recorder owned by García, which he rigged up with a microphone and a Walkman tape-player, thus allowing its use as mixing board. The original run of Primera Dosis was of 200 cassette tapes. The album made an instant splash, being the first entirely-DIY rock album in Peru, and Narcosis was soon offered a recording contract by a Lima music label. The band, however, decided to continue independently. Their second album, Acto de Magia, issued in September 1985, is a live recording of a gig performed at the Magia bar in Lima's Barranco district. One of Narcosis' most notorious appearances took place on 17 February 1985, at the Rock en Rio Rímac festival in Lima's Rímac district. There, Narcosis played before a crowd of 5,000, alongside a number of other bands representing Lima's emerging \\"underground\\" scene. There was also a heavy police presence, and when Narcosis launched into their song \\"Sucio Policía\\" (Filthy Cop), the festival came to an abrupt end as the police showed their displeasure by firing into the air and rushing the stage. In 1986 the band members drifted on their separate ways and into other projects. Vial joined the band Autopsia, García joined Miki González's band before becoming part of Mar de Copas, while Madueño joined the band Eructo Maldonado. Narcosis reunited in 2001 for two 15th anniversary appearances, and have, since then, occasionally come together for other special events, sometimes with musician friends adding to the band's lineup.

SSAO is found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and various other tissues. The physiological function of SSAO is not well understood. Development of blood vessels, lipolysis regulation, and detoxication are suggested. It may function as a scavenger enzyme to assist MAO.

Ayaal was earlier titled Nagabandham.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-27/news-and- interviews/38041034_1_omegaexe-ineya-nagabandham The film released on 28 June 2013. Ayaal is a story of intense human relations. It’s a story of a man who effortlessly floated along the estuaries of time, the back waters of Vembanad. If love is the flowering of one’s own heart, can it have a direction? Is it Scalar (direction less). This is an uncomfortable question raised by him, the protagonist, Guru Dasan. The film problematizes the conventional fabric of human relations, its rules and its sanctity.  Plot  Set in late 1950s, the film uses the symbols of Serpentine Worship and socio-political rebellions during that period of time to create an ambience for storytelling. The protagonist Dasan is a practicing Pulluvan, who has an aura of ascribed divinity around him. He has two wives, Janaki and Chakara. Janaki’s love with Dasan is platonic, but Chakara true to her name is possessive. Dasan along the course of time becomes passionate with Devaki Antharjanam, the wife of the village landlord as well. Be it wine, women or smoke, Dasan has no restrictions. His mastery over the profession was unparalleled. Due to the ascribed divinity around him, he is unquestioned. But not for too long. Something happens which makes his life topsy-turvy! The event also brings out the tenacity and quality of relations he had. The film depicts the various shades of love and problematizes the conventional concepts around it. It is also an attempt to transcend the definitions of love and to explore the flowering of bonds which are more deep rooted than love. What do we call it?

Kazikova made her first Czech team, as a 28-year-old, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she competed only in individual and relay freestyle events. She also joined with her fellow swimmers Jana Myšková, Petra Klosová, and Ilona Hlaváčková for the women's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. Swimming the anchor leg, Kazikova recorded a split of 57.90 seconds, and the Czech team went on to finish heat one in seventh place and thirteenth overall, for a total time of 3:46.83. In the 50 m freestyle, Kazikova edged out third placer Triin Aljand by one hundredth of a second (0.01) in heat seven at 26.18 seconds. Finishing only in twenty-fifth place, Kazikova failed to qualify for the semifinals. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Kazikova qualified for the second time in the women's 50 m freestyle. She cleared a FINA B-standard entry time of 25.93 seconds from the Czech Winter Championships in Prague. She challenged seven other swimmers in the eighth heat, including Bahamas' Arianna Vanderpool- Wallace, Jamaica's Natasha Moodie. Kazikova cruised to third place by 0.14 of a second behind Vanderpool-Wallace, with a time of 25.54 seconds. Kazikova, however, failed to advance into the semifinals, as she placed twenty-ninth out of 92 swimmers in the preliminaries.

In November 2014, Jonathan Mann set a world record for the most consecutive days writing a song.  Career  Mann started composing at the age of 12, before enrolling at Bennington College. While pursuing his graduate studies at CalArts, he co-wrote and starred in a rock opera called \\"The Last Nympho Leprechaun\\" with colleague Thomas Hughes. In grad school, he wrote and starred in a rock opera based on the Super Mario Brothers. Since then, he has recorded music and self-released albums under the names Forty (or 40) Second Songs, The Nympho Leprechauns, Novox the Robot, GameJew, The Mario Opera, as well as simply Jonathan Mann. In 2006, Mann started uploading videos to YouTube under the alias \\"GameJew.\\" He later started his best known project, \\"Song A Day,\\" which has been continuously operating since January 1, 2009. The project came to national attention following several viral hits and an exposé on CNN. From 2006 to 2012, Jonathan lived in the San Francisco Bay Area and made many live appearances with the band of local musicians he formed and dubbed The Rock Cookie Bottoms. After many personnel changes, the group's membership solidified around 2009 with keyboardist Pete Feltman, singer Nic Kaelin, bassist Eric Yeargan, guitarist Sam Douglass and drummer Sparky Grinstead (who went by the name Norman Famous). A singer-songwriter with his own career, Grinstead (Famous) was a huge fan of Mr. Mann's work and provided the band with a studio and much of its equipment. They were often joined onstage by Oakland-based multi-instrumentalist Matthew Joseph Payne (Sparky's son). The band stayed together until 2012 when Jonathan left California for New York. In July 2012, Mann's \\"Song a Day: The Album\\" initiative let colleagues from around the world interact with performers and contribute to compositions via livestream. The album was produced by Mann along with Nick Krill and Thomas Hughes of the Spinto Band and was recorded at Famous House, the Berkeley, CA home studio of fellow Singer/Songwriter Sparky Grinstead (who was at the time playing drums with Jonathan's band, The Rock Cookie Bottoms, under the name Norman Famous. Members of the Rock Cookie Bottoms made cameo appearances on the album, as did \\"fluffy,\\" a long-time participant in Song Fight!. In June 2014, Mann celebrated his 2000th song with a Reddit AMA (\\"Ask Me Anything\\"), creating songs as answers to the questions and a tribute \\"Song a Day\\" video on YouTube. Mann contributes to the music on the Night Vales Presents podcast 'Sleep With Me', presented by Andrew Ackerman.  Personal life  Mann married in January 2014. He and his wife have two children. Mann's duet with his ex-girlfriend about their breakup became one of his viral hits.  Notable compositions  *As GameJew, Mann (wearing a Mario costume) sought out and sang a tribute to Nintendo luminary Shigeru Miyamoto during the 2007 Game Developers Conference.

Although diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown, Jersey has been developing its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains the Bureau de Jersey in Caen, France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation, with a branch office in Rennes. A similar office, the Maison de Normandie in St. Helier, represents the Conseil général of Manche and the Regional Council of Lower Normandy. It also houses the Consulate of France. In July 2009, a Channel Islands Tunnel was proposed to connect Jersey with Lower Normandy. Jersey is a member of the British-Irish Council, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Assemblée parlementaire de la Francophonie. Jersey wants to become a full member of the Commonwealth in its own right.Jersey Evening Post, 23 September 2006 International identity In 2007, the Chief Minister and the UK Lord Chancellor signed an agreement that established a framework for the development of the international identity of Jersey. The agreement stated that: *the UK has no democratic accountability in and for Jersey; *the UK will not act internationally on behalf of Jersey without prior consultation; *Jersey has an international identity that is different from that of the UK; *the UK recognises that the interests of Jersey may differ from those of the UK, and the UK will seek to represent any differing interests when acting in an international capacity; and *the UK and Jersey will work together to resolve or clarify any differences that may arise between their respective interests. The preamble to the States of Jersey Law 2005 declares that 'it is recognized that Jersey has autonomous capacity in domestic affairs' and 'it is further recognized that there is an increasing need for Jersey to participate in matters of international affairs'. In January 2011, the Chief Minister designated one of his assistant ministers as having responsibility for external relations; he is now often described as the island's 'foreign minister'.'Meet our new foreign minister', Jersey Evening Post, 14 January 2011 ; Editorial, 'A new role of great importance', Jersey Evening Post, 17 January 2011 In 2013 the Chief Minister proposed converting the post of assistant minister with responsibility for external relations to a full ministerial post. Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) have been signed directly by the island with several countries, including: the United States of America (2002); the Netherlands (2007); Denmark, the Faroes, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway (2008); the United Kingdom, France, Australia and New Zealand (2009); Portugal (2010); People's Republic of China, Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Indonesia, Czech Republic, South Africa, Argentina, and India (2011); Brazil and Latvia (2013). Relations with Guernsey In September 2010 a Channel Islands Brussels Office was set up jointly by the two Bailiwicks to develop the Channel Islands' influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands' governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU. On 24 January 2013 Jersey signed double taxation agreements with Guernsey (updating the existing agreement) and with the Isle of Man. This was the first time all three Crown dependencies had established such mutual agreements which also included provision for exchange of tax information equivalent to TIEAs. Relations with the United Kingdom The relationship between the Crown dependencies and the UK is \\"one of mutual respect and support, ie, a partnership\\". Until 2001, responsibility for the UK government's relationships with the Crown dependencies rested with the Home Office, but it was then transferred first to the Lord Chancellor's Department, then to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, and finally to the Ministry of Justice. In 2010 the Ministry of Justice stated that relationships with the Crown dependencies are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government as a whole, with the Ministry of Justice holding responsibility for the constitutional relationship and other ministries engaging with their opposite numbers in the Crown dependencies according to their respective policy areas. Since 2011 the government of Jersey has sent representatives to the main party conferences of the United Kingdom, its \\"most significant economic partner\\", as part of a commitment to enhancing political engagement with the UK. In 2012 the Assistant Chief Minister attended the conference of the UK Liberal Democrats, the Chief Minister attended the UK Labour Party conference, and the Deputy Chief Minister and Treasury and Resources Minister were announced to attend the UK Conservative Party conference. Guernsey's Deputy Chief Minister and Jersey's Assistant Chief Minister travelled to Dublin in September 2012 as a first step in a more coordinated approach to international relations. The purpose of the visit was to meet Ireland's Minister for European Affairs for mutual discussions ahead of Ireland's assumption of the European Union presidency in 2013. =Separation debate= The question of an independent Jersey has been discussed from time to time in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. In 2005–2008, a working group of the States of Jersey examined the options for independence, concluding that Jersey \\"is equipped to face the challenges of independence\\" but making no recommendations. Proposals for Jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the States.Editorial, 'Legal ideas of political importance', Jersey Evening Post, 21 September 2010 ; Andy Sibcy, 'Sovereignty or dependency on agenda at conference', Jersey Evening Post, 17 September 2010 In July 2005, the Policy and Resources Committee of the States of Jersey established the Constitutional Review Group, chaired by Sir Philip Bailhache, with terms of reference \\"to conduct a review and evaluation of the potential advantages and disadvantages for Jersey in seeking independence from the United Kingdom or other incremental change in the constitutional relationship, while retaining the Queen as Head of State\\". The Group's Second Interim Report was presented to the States by the Council of Ministers in June 2008.Second Interim Report of the Constitution Review Group (States Greffe, Jersey) http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/display_result.asp?url=\\\\documents\\\\reports\\\\46527-24954-2762008.htm In October 2012 the Council of Ministers issued a \\"Common policy for external relations\\" that noted \\"that it is not Government policy to seek independence from the United Kingdom, but rather to ensure that Jersey is prepared if it were in the best interests of Islanders to do so\\". On the basis of the established principles the Council of Ministers decided to \\"ensure that Jersey is prepared for external change that may affect the Island’s formal relationship with the United Kingdom and/or European Union\\". Relations with the Commonwealth Jersey is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations in its own right, but through its association with the United Kingdom. It participates in various Commonwealth institutions in its own right: for example, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Commonwealth Games. Jersey regards the existing situation as unsatisfactory and has lobbied for change. The States of Jersey have called on the UK Foreign Secretary to request that the Commonwealth Heads of Government \\"consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other Crown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced stage of autonomy\\". Jersey has proposed that it be accorded \\"self-representation in all Commonwealth meetings; full participation in debates and procedures, with a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into discussions with those who are full members; and no right to vote in the Ministerial or Heads of Government meetings, which is reserved for full members\\". Relations with the European Union Jersey is neither a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. However, that is not to say that it is outside the European Communities or the European Union in the sense that it is excluded. As Jersey was a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, in 1972, it fell within the definition of a Community Territory when the Act of Accession was negotiated. The relationship between Jersey and the European Communities was negotiated as a modified extension of the existing relationship with the United Kingdom by Sir Geoffrey Rippon, as he was then. The only European Territories under United Kingdom responsibility which were excluded were the Sovereign Base Territories in Cyprus. Had the Special relationship not been negotiated, then Jersey would have been included within the Communities in the same way as Gibraltar. The Island's relationship with the EC and the EU is governed by article 26(3) of the Act of Accession, amending article 227 of the then EEC Treaty, now Article 355(5)(c) TFEU. That article acts together with Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972 which was incorporated into the Treaties, by article 158 of the Act of Accession. On Cyprus' Accession, the exclusion of the Cyprus Base Territories was reversed, and the resulting article 355(5)(b) no longer contains the term excluded. For Jersey to be outside the EU and the EC, the term excluded would have had to have been employed. The Treaties therefore apply, but only to the extent necessary to give effect to the arrangements in the Protocol. Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: Article 355(5)(c) states that \\"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\\". Protocol 3 and other relevant treaty provisions are made part of Jersey Law by the European Communities (Jersey) Law 1973. Hence the inclusion of provisions of Community law and judgements of the CJEU within the laws of the Island through those provisions, in a similar manner as in the United Kingdom. The relationship between the Channel Islands and the EU cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of all Member States and Island authorities.See Under Protocol 3, Jersey is part of the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non- Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey.Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?isOldUri=true&uri;=CELEX:61996CJ0171 However, for the time that the UK is an EU member, Jersey is required to apply the same rules to EU nationals as it does to UK nationals, who can move to Jersey by virtue of the Common Travel Area.States of Jersey Brexit Report, 31 January 2017, p. 7 https://statesassembly.gov.je/assemblypropositions/2017/p.7-2017.pdf Nor is Jersey part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. Jersey plans to incorporate such measures where appropriate, with particular regard to the island's commitment to meeting international standards of financial regulation and countering money laundering and terrorist financing. Hence the working parallel with the prior constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom. Note however the CJEU in Pereira held that article 4 of the Third Protocol required the Island's authorities to give same treatment to all legal and natural persons of the Communities applied in any area where the Treaties would be applicable in a territory in which they were fully applicable. That implies that the Treaties in those areas are applicable in principle, but through the article 4 threshold. The Commission's position on the relationship was stated clearly in a reply by Commissioner Prodi in 2003 to a European Parliamentary question. He confirmed that Jersey was within the European Union to the extent that the United Kingdom was responsible for its external relationships, and evoked the Treaties and the arrangements within the Protocol. The European Council mandated the Commission in 2013 to initiate negotiations with European States and Territories outside the Communities on their implementation of the amendments to the EC Savings Directive. Jersey was not on that list, as it is not outside the Communities or the Union, but has a special relationship within these. British citizens who only have a bloodline connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another Member state of the European Union, were not considered to be European Union citizens within the sphere of the freedom of movement of persons. They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued British passports are endorsed with the words the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment. Jersey residents do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions. Jersey is particularly concerned about European Union legislation and reforms that may affect its trading partners in international financial centres round the world. Group meetings=Trilateral Crown dependency= The three crown dependencies, while independent, share a relatively similar position with respect to the United Kingdom and with international bodies such as the EU or the OECD. As a result, the crown dependencies work together on areas of mutual interest. For example, in 2000, the three states cooperated on development of common policies for offshore banking. In 2003, they developed a joint approach to certain EU activities around tax information. The heads of government of the crown dependencies, including Isle of Man, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, and Jersey, meet at an annual inter-island summit, to discuss matters of common concern, such as financial regulation and relations with the UK. = British–Irish Council= Jersey has formed part of the British–Irish Council since it was formed in 1999, as does the Isle of Man. Meetings take place twice a year, in 2002, 2009 and 2013 the meetings have taken place in Jersey. Its stated aim is to \\"promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands\\". Jersey is leading the Creative Industries discussions.

He wrote interesting articles on international cricket and horse racing for newspapers such as The Barrier Miner. In 1907 he built a magnificent home, \\"Merriwa\\" on Orrong Road, Toorak, under architect Walter Richmond Butler, and established a large and exquisitely planned garden (he was a keen gardener, especially of roses) which featured an expanse of indigenous flowering plants unmatched outside Botanical Gardens. In February 1917 the car he was driving on High Street, St Kilda, struck and killed William Fitzsimmons, who had jumped down from the seat of his lorry into the path of the oncoming vehicle. The following September he sold \\"Meeriwa\\" to Mrs. Charles Moore, the wealthy owner of Charles Moore and Co.. His next home was \\"Myoora\\", previously the home of Robert Harper, MLA, close to the Toorak tram terminus. Dame Nellie Melba had been a tenant of this stately mansion for five months in 1902. His palatial weekender, \\"Ellerslie\\" at Mornington, Victoria previously owned by Sir Frederick Sargood, was destroyed by fire in April 1908. Arson was suspected.

Kibalnikov was a small child when his gift for art became apparent. His parents did not support their son's interest, wanting him to receive a technical education. He ran away from home twice, without money or documents, and went to Saratov, where he tried to be admitted to the local art school. He worked as a loader at the port and made many drawings, mostly portraits of his friends. Those pencil drawings received high grades at the entrance exams, and he was soon enrolled in the Department of Painting at the Saratov School of Art and Manufacturing. After graduation, Kibalnikov worked as a designer in the theater. However, the young artist was increasingly drawn to sculpture. He studied the works of major sculptors in the Saratov Art Gallery. The contest to create a sculpture of N. Chernyshevsky in Saratov, announced in 1940, offered Kibalnikov a chance to try his hand at sculpture. His work on sculpture of Chernyshevsky went well until it was interrupted by World War II. Career In 1949, Kibalnikov's work on creating the image of Chernyshevsky was rewarded with the USSR State Prize for his bronze statue Nikolai Chernyshevsky (1948).Monument to Chernishevsky in Saratov. 1953 г. Kibalnikov took part in work on the monumental sculpture of Vladimir Mayakovsky in Moscow in the 1950s. Many famous masters tried to create the poet's image in sculpture, among them Matvey Manizer, Sergey Konenkov, Nikolai Tomsky, Yevgeny Vuchetich, Mikhail Anikushin, Lev Kerbel. Kibalnikov's work received support due to its vibrant expressiveness, and won final approval. The bronze figure of the poet was unveiled in 1958; in 1959 the sculptor was awarded the Lenin Prize for this work. Kibalnikov's work on the monument to Sergei Yesenin in Ryazan, unveiled in 1975, earned him the Repin Prize of the Russian Federation. Kibalnikov created Tretyakov's sculptural portrait in marble in 1961. For more than 20 years he nurtured his dream to create a monument to Pavel Tretyakov. Kibalnikov fulfilled his task brilliantly. Both the size and color of the monument blended seamlessly into the complex of the Tretyakov Gallery. The monument opened in 1980. ReferencesSources * Biography.

The church was built from 1889 to 1892, replacing an earlier church built in 1865 at a different site. French Canadian architect Gregoire Vigeant designed the church in the Romanesque Revival style; the design has a heavy French influence which can be seen in its Greek cross layout, its hipped roofs and square domes, and the emphasis on height suggested by its two cupolas and its lantern. Due to the declining size of its original French congregation, the Archdiocese of Chicago gave control of the church to the Fathers of the Blessed Sacrament in 1918. The church hosted the International Eucharistic Congress in 1926. As the successor to the St. Louis Church, the first French church in Chicago, Notre Dame de Chicago represents a significant part of the history of French immigrants in Chicago. The church has been called \\"the best extant landmark associated with the French in Chicago\\" and \\"the only surviving French monument\\" in the city. Due to its importance to the history of the French community and its architectural significance, the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 1979. In January 2019, it was announced that the parish would be merged with nearby Holy Family Church as part of the Chicago Archdiocese's reconfiguration plan. A pastor for both parishes would say Masses in both locations but be based out of Notre Dame, with Holy Family still available for special events and weddings. The merger took effect in July 2019.

Biography Ayyavu Swamikal was born in 1814 in Nakalapuram in Tamil Nadu.Brahmasree Thycaud Ayyavu Swami. Trivandrum, Ayyavu Mission, 1997 His original name was Subharayan. His parents were Mutthukumaran and Rugmini Ammal. His father and grandfather Sri Hrishikesan were scholars and experts in yoga and spiritual sciences.(Ayyaavu means Father) At the age of twelve, Subharayan received spiritual initiation from two Tamil Saints, Sachidananda Maharaj and Sri Chitti Paradeshi who used to visit his father. They told his family that his life has a specific assignment, he is destined to serve humanity at another place and that when it is time they would come and take him to mould him to fulfil his duty. These avadutas are said to be connected to great siddhas from Tamil Nadu living in Himalayas who knew the science of immortality. When he was 16, the two siddhas took him with them to Palani where he learned advanced yoga. He travelled with them to Burma, Singapore, Penang and Africa. With them he met teachers of many religions and saints. Subbarayan mastered English during his stay and travel with them. He also acquired proficiency in English, Siddha medicine and alchemy during his wanderings with the siddhas. At the age of nineteen he was sent back home with instructions to look after his parents and brethren. At home he continued worshiping Goddess and yogic practices, often entering the state of Samadhi. His biographers and disciples state that by this time he had acquired the Ashtasiddhies or divine powers including that of astral travel. Occasionally he visited Pazhani, Chennai and other religious places as part of pilgrimages for participating scholarly discussions going on there. He also started writing and composed 'Brahmothara Khandam' and 'Pazani Vaibhavam'. At the age of 27, as suggested by his gurus he visited Kodungalloor Devi Temple in Kerala. It is said that his devotion was so deep and his prayers were so strong that when he recited the keerthans the temples bells rang by themselves and the doors opened to give him darsan. Once in a dream Goddess told him that she will appear before him at Trivandrum and he went there during the period of Swathi Tirunal Maharaja. The king came to know of his scholarship and expertise in Sivaraja Yoga and invited him to the palace and also learned many things from him.Marthanda Varma, Sri Padmanabhadasa. Swathithirunalum Thycaud Ayyavu Swamium. In Thycaud Ayyavu Guru Mahasamadhi Sathavarshika Smaranika, 2010 One day while a family gathering related to a marriage was going on at the house where he stayed a very old lean women told him that someone will be coming to meet him from his village and asked him to go to the traveller's shed near by on that night. The Goddess gave darsan to him at that travellers' shed that night. Later Thycaud Devi Temple was constructed at this site. Before long he went back to Tamil Nadu. Within a few months his father left to Kasi. The whole responsibility for the family fell on his shoulders and he started a business to support his family. In accordance with the direction of his guru, Subbarayan got married. He used to deliver spiritual discourses at Chennai. As part of his business he was supplying goods to military camp in Chennai, where he came in contact with a British official Mr. McGregor. McGregor became fond of this English speaking Tamil villager and established a friendship with him. He was interested in Indian religion, language and culture and he became his student. During the reign of Maharaja Ayillyam Thirunal, McGregor became the Resident of Travancore. When the selection of a manager for Residency came he appointed him as the Manager of his Residency in Thycaud in 1873. As this post was one of the senior most offices that the British allowed to natives, people respectfully called him 'Superintend Ayyavu'. The term 'Ayyavu' means a respectable or venerable person. Gradually when people understood his yogic powers and scholarship the name changed from Superintend Ayyavu to Ayyavu Swami. Swami kept strict discipline in work and was extremely punctual. Ayyavu Swamikal visited Vaikunda Swami of Nagarcoil and also the famous Maruthwamalai where he sat in meditation for days. At his residence he spent most of his time in meditation and in initiating and instructing his disciples in spiritual practices. Ayyavu used to deliver lectures on Bhakthi, Yoga and Vedanta in Jnanaprjagaram; where the leading literary, social and spiritual personalities in and around Trivandrum used assemble discuss and deliver lectures and discourses. He in association with Manonmaniam Sundaram Pillai, founded the Saiva Prakasha Sabha of Trivandrum. He already knew that he had to permanently withdraw from this objective world and enter into Samadhi on that day. When the King knew about his approaching Samadhi he wanted to provide a place for Samadhi near the palace and construct a temple there. But Ayyavu insisted that his Samadhi should be in the Thycaud cremation ground and should be a very simple and small structure. Ayyavu Swami attained Samadhi on 20 July 1909. A Shivalinga was installed over the Samadhi site of Ayyavu Swami in Thycaud in 1943. This temple was improved under the patronage of Sri Chithira Thirunal Maharaja the last king of Travancore. This is now known as Thycaud Siva Temple. Works Ayyavu wrote several books on Bhakthi, Jnana and Yoga in Sanskrit, Tamil and Malayalam. A few were later published by his disciples. The works that could be identified as his are: *Brahmotharakandom *Pazhanidaivam *Ramayanam Pattu *Utjaini Mahakali Pancharatnam *Thiruvarur Murukan *Kumara Kovil Kuravan *Ulloor Amarntha Guhan *Ramayanam Sundarkandom *Hanuman Paamalai *Ente Kasiyathra Disciples Ayyavu Swamikal was instrumental in shaping the personalities of many spiritual, cultural and social leaders of erstwhile Travancore in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ayyavu demonstrated by his own life how realisation of the Supreme Self is possible even for ordinary people through practising Siva Raja Yoga. The greatness of what he taught is that realisation is possible even while leading family life and carrying out one’s worldly duties.Chattampi Swami, Narayana GuruSanu, M K. Narayana Guru: A biography. Trivandrum, Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay, 1998. who contributed much for the modernisation of Kerala were his disciples. Ayyavu Swami had about fifty disciples consisting of people from diverse fields and castes extending from palace to huts, Nambuthiries, Nairs, Ezhavas, Nadars, Princesses, administrators, doctors, engineers, Muslims, Christians, Hindus and the like. The following are important disciples: *Spiritual Masters and Reformers- Hindu: Chattampi Swami, Narayana Guru, Swayamprakasa Yogini Amma (Kulathoor), Kollathamma. Muslim: Makkadi Labba, Thakkala Peermuhammad. Christian: Petta Fernandez. *Social and Political Leaders: Ayyankali. *Kings, Administrators: Swathi Tirunal Maharaja, Mc Gregor (British Resident), Surya Narayana Iyer, Muthukumara Swami Pillai, Vailur Rayasam Madhavan Pillai and Periya Perumal Pillai, Sundaram Iyyenkar (Peshkars/administrators). *Artists and men of Letters: Raja Ravi Varma (Painter), Kerala Varma Koithampuran, and A.R. Rajaraja Varma (Literature), *Padmanbhan Vaidyan (Musician). Predictions Ayyguru Swamikal was a good astrologer and had also the siddhi to predict future events. His predictions that the younger Maharanis' son will become the last Maharaja, that North India will get separated, Ayyankali will be nominated to a participative administrative body to help the downtrodden, the day of his Samadhi etc. became true. Ayyankali was nominated to Sri Moolam Assembly and was honoured by the Rulers and later his statue was unveiled by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Maharaja Chithira Tirunal was also the last King of Travancore as he predicted. Swami also attained Samadhi on the date, he predicted. India got separated into India and Pakistan about fifty years after his prediction. Philosophy Ayyavu Swamikal was an adept of 'Siva Raja Yoga', an ancient technique practised by Tamil Saiva Yogis like Agasthyar, Bhogar and their line. He was one of the great teachers of Sivaraja Yoga in modern times. He belonged to the line of Tamil Siddhas consisting of Agasthyar, Bogar, Tirumular, Tirujnana Sambhandhar, Manikka vachakar etc.Ravikumar, G. Sivarajayogam. In. Thaikkatt Ayyavu Guru Mahasamadhi Sathavarshika Smaranika. Trivandrum, Ayyavu Mission Trust, 2010. His disciples Chattampi Swami, Narayana Guru, Swayam Prakasini Amma, and others continued that line. He taught his disciples the principles of Advaitha, and the practice of one God, one religion and one caste. He proclaimed that 'Intha Ulakathile Ore Oru Matham, Ore Oru Jathy, Ore Oru Kadavul Than'. (One caste, one religion and one god in this world). This teaching influenced Chattampi Swami and Narayana Guru. Guru translated this doctrine into Malayalam- 'Oru jathy, oru matham, oru daivam manushyanu' which got a magical charm and helped to remove caste difference from the mind of the people of Kerala. The movements initiated by Ayyavu Swami and his disciples are more based on Humanism, Rationalism and Democracy based on universal love rather than the European model of Renaissance or Reformation.

Reception  The Times of India wrote \\"The film is packaged entirely around its hero with NTR looking uber cool and as stylish as ever. He got into the skin of the character and has delivered a fantastic performance to shoulder the film. All in all, Ramayya Vasthavayya's first half is a fun-ride as you see NTR in his elements. However, the second half could be a disappointment.\\" The Hindu wrote \\"Until a few minutes before the interval, you’re left looking beneath the surface of the comedy, songs and romance to see what the film is trying to communicate to you. And post interval, when the film takes you into a rural hamlet and recalls an ill-fated past followed by revenge, there’s way too much bloodshed that leaves you numb. Watch this film if you are an NTR fan.\\" Sify wrote \\"Can watch it for its first half and for NTR. Other than that, the movie is just another routine revenge drama that fails to impress\\" and rated it 2.75/5. IANS called the film \\"a hero-worshipping, fan-appealing film that gets almost everything in the book of filmmaking wrong\\" in its review. 123telugu stated \\"Ramayya Vasthavayya is a stylish mass entertainer that showcases all of NTR’s abilities very well. The superb first half is a big asset. A predictable and below par second half is a slight let down. However, the film should work well at the Box Office and NTR's fans will be a delighted lot\\" and rated the film 3.25/5. Oneindia Entertainment stated \\"Ramayya Vasthavayya is purely a mass masala entertainer that will impress all classes of audiences. Junior NTR's acting, Harish [sic] direction, Shruti Haasan's glamour and Thaman's music stand out in the film. It is a brilliant treat from Dil Raju team.\\" IndiaGlitz wrote \\"In telling an outdated and damn predictable story, Harish Shankar S committed one blunder after another. His only trump card was a romantic NTR, who is seen imitating Dev Anand here and Victory Venkatesh there. A paper-thin storyline is the least of Ramayya's imperfections. Too much violence in the second half rips it of entertainment value\\" and rated the film 2.75/5.  Box office  Ramayya Vasthavayya opened to packed houses with 90% to 100% occupancy in single screens and multiplexes. The film grossed approximately in Nizam, in Ceded, in Nellore, in Guntur, in Krishna, in West, in East, in Uttarandhra, in Karnataka, from rest of India and in Overseas on its first day taking its global first day total to . The film stood in the third spot in the list of Telugu cinema with the highest first-day share in Andhra Pradesh with Attarintiki Daredi and Baadshah standing in the first two spots. However the film's collections dropped significantly on its second day except in Guntur, Nellore, Ceded and Karnataka regions while a lukewarm response was observed at the USA box office.

In its first week the film collected a worldwide share of but failed to surpass Attarintiki Daredi which collected a worldwide share of in its first week. Trade experts opined that the film's business would be closed soon due to the successful run of Attarintiki Daredi. In its full run, the film collected a worldwide share of and performed poorly at the box office. It earned in Andhra Pradesh and also became the second biggest earner for N. T. Rama Rao Jr. in Nizam and Karnataka areas, where it fetched and , respectively.

This operation ceased in 1884 when the Mortdale Brickworks was established near Mortdale Public School.Mortdale in Early Days, DJ Hatton, 1981 Mortdale Park had a very difficult beginning. Many different associations vied for their own piece of land in Mortdale for a park - the local Chamber of Commerce, the RSL, the local Parents & Citizens group and the Council.Mortdale in Early Days, DJ Hatton, 1981 Debate started in September 1924 when residents asked for a park on the corner of Victoria Avenue and Cook Street. Within a year the Chamber of Commerce put forward an alternative at the corner of Morts and Forest Roads. Over the next few years both sites were advocated as possibilities, but the location finally chosen was on Boundary Road between Martin Place and Oxford Street. Mortdale Park was operational by 1935. In 1942, Hurstville Council refused the local Presbyterian Church permission to construct air raid trenches in the Park for its children. The Mortdale Memorial Monument, originally erected in the Shopping Centre during 1922, was later moved to Mortdale Park. In 1976 the current memorial was built.

Description  The institute conducts application projects with software and system companies, as well as the IT departments of large corporations. The goal of these projects is to generate new products and services to directly improve the management and data usage of mid-size companies. . The following research groups represent the institute: *Analytical Information Systems *Cyber-Physical Systems *Empirical Research and User Experience (ERUX) *Multimedia Information Systems *Sustainability, Compliance and IT Laws *System Integration *Visual Analytics The institute's main task is to prove results of international research projects for practicality, to adjust them and to make them available for economy and society. It represents the connection between international research and development in this area and the actual practice in companies.  Projects = Migraine Radar = The goal of this Migraine Radar is the systematic analysis of factors responsible for episodic headache diseases like migraine or tension headache. One important research objective is the examination of the correlation between increased migraine attack rates and changing weather conditions. In 2011 Migraine Radar was one of the winners in the competition \\"Was macht gesund?\\" ('What makes healthy?') by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany). The migraine data are recorded via a web-based form as well as smartphone apps throughout Germany since June 2011. The second project phase has been started in June 2015 in cooperation with the Migraine and Headache Clinic Königstein and the Institute of Medical Psychology and Medical Sociology at University of Rostock. Furthermore, the migraine data acquisition was also extended to Austria and Switzerland. = Digital mobility = Digital Mobility aims to make mobility in rural areas more economical, attractive and environmentally friendly and to strengthen Germany's position as a digital location through new solutions for data use. Providing more rural, peripheral regions with appropriate mobility offers will be one of the major challenges of transport policy in the future. In addition, the age structure in many areas of Germany will change considerably in the coming years. There will be more older people. Attractive yet economically viable mobile services in regions particularly affected by demographic change are therefore essential. They are a prerequisite for the accessibility of jobs and training places, access to adequate nursing and medical care, to shopping and leisure facilities and the maintenance of social contacts. In Digital Mobilityt, the use of digital data resources for a comprehensive mobility model will be conceptually developed, experimentally tested and evaluated using the Hochfranken region as an example. = Enterprise 4.0 for SME - The Digital Transformation (WiMiT) = Enterprise 4.0 for SME is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and pays particular attention to foster research, technological development and innovation.

His posthumously published memoir, The Boy on the Wooden Box: How the Impossible Became Possible . . . on Schindler's List details his survival during the Holocaust.  Life = Early life = Leyson was born Leib Lejzon in Narewka, Poland to Moshe Lejzon and Chanah Lejzon (née Golner) on September 15, 1929. He had four siblings: Hershel, Betzalel (called Tsalig), Pesza, and David. He also had a large extended family. He and his family members were all observant Jews. The Lejzons were also farmers, and came from an ancestry of farming. Narewka was a small town, with only one car and little to no access to electricity. Leyson later recalled there being some division between Jews and gentiles in Narewka, including antisemitic jokes, or being chased away from a place for being a Jew on Christian holidays. In 1938, the Lejzons moved to Kraków for better job opportunities. Leib began to experience overt antisemitism for the first time attending public school in Kraków. A year later, Germany invaded Poland and soon after began placing restrictions on Jews. Moshe Lejzon was arrested by the Germans and held without charges for three months before being released. = The Holocaust = After the invasion, Hershel Lejzon fled back to the family's home village of Narewka, then occupied by the Soviet Union. In 1941, he and the rest of the town's Jews, including most of the Lejzons’ extended family members, were massacred by the Nazis when they invaded. The Lejzons only found out about their deaths after the war ended. Six months after the German army entered Kraków, the area's Jews were ordered to leave their homes and move into the Kraków Ghetto. Lejzon's father, Moshe, and his brother David began working for Oskar Schindler at his enamelware factory soon after. Channah, Leib and Pesza were covered under Moshe's pass until they found work, sparing them from deportation to an extermination camp. Tsalig Lejzon was unable to get an employment pass, and was put on a train for deportation, most likely to the Bełżec extermination camp. Schindler, who was already at the station having some of his workers taken off the train, recognized him and offered to have him taken off as well. Tsalig refused, as he did not want to leave his girlfriend. Neither of them survived, likely being murdered shortly after arrival in Bełżec or a similar camp. In 1943, the Kraków Ghetto was liquidated by Nazi authorities. Those who survived and were not sent to extermination camps were sent to the newly built Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp under the notorious commandant Amon Göth, who Leib encountered on more than one occasion. Moshe managed to get Leib and Channah transferred out of Płaszów to Schindler's factory, where they remained in relative safety for almost a year. In 1944, Leib and his surviving family members were placed on the famous Schindler's list. Leib's number on the list was 69128. The male , including Leib, David and Moshe, were transferred from Płaszów to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp for a few days before being sent on to Schindler's new camp, Brünnlitz in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, part of occupied Czechoslovakia. Leib was so traumatized by the experience that later he could not recall if they had spent days, weeks, or months there. The female , including Channah and Pesza, were sent to Auschwitz–Birkenau where they spent a harrowing few weeks before Schindler bribed Nazi officials into releasing them to Brünnlitz. Despite Schindler and his wife, Emilie's, efforts to care for the workers, food was in short supply at Brünnlitz. Oskar Schindler was fond of Leib, calling him \\"Little Lejzon\\". He arranged for him to have extra rations, which Leib shared with his family. Schindler also had Leib transferred to easier work and had him taken off the night shift. On May 9, 1945, a few days after the guards, and then Schindler had fled, a lone Russian soldier arrived to announce that they were liberated. = Later life = After the Red Army liberated Brünnlitz, the Lejzons briefly returned to Kraków, before Leib and his parents left for a displaced persons camp in Wetzlar, American-occupied Germany. In 1949, Lejzon and his parents immigrated to the United States, where they changed their family name to Leyson and Leib adopted the name Leon. His surviving siblings, David and Pesza (who changed her name to Aviva), immigrated first to Czechoslovakia and then settled in Israel. In 1951, Leyson was drafted and served as an engineer in the US Army in Okinawa, Japan for sixteen months during the Korean War. He began teaching at Huntington Park High School in 1958. He met his wife, Elisabeth Burns, in January 1965. They married that year in July. Leyson studied industrial arts at Los Angeles City College and California State University, Los Angeles, and later earned a Master's in education from Pepperdine University in 1970. He taught tech ed and was a guidance counselor at Huntington Park High School for 39 years, before his retirement in 1997. In 1972, he met his savior Oskar Schindler one last time at a reunion of survivors in Los Angeles, before Schindler's death in 1974. Leyson was not sure Schindler would remember him, but he recognized him immediately, saying \\"I know who you are, you're Little Leyson!\\" Leyson kept quiet about his experiences during the Holocaust until the release of the film Schindler's List, and the public interest that followed. He began speaking publicly about his experiences to audiences around the United States and Canada. He was a member of Rodgers Center for Holocaust Education Advisory Board at Chapman University. = Death and legacy = Leyson died on January 12, 2013 of lymphoma in Fullerton, California. He was survived by his two children, six grandchildren and his wife, Elisabeth B. Leyson. His book about his Holocaust experiences, The Boy on the Wooden Box, was published after his death with the help of his wife. The book was coauthored by Elisabeth B. Leyson and Holocaust scholar Dr. Marilyn J. Harran. The title came from Leyson, at age 13, needing to stand on a wooden box to reach the machinery in the factory at Brünnlitz. The book was successful, becoming a New York Times Best Seller. It also won a Christopher Award.  Writing  * The Boy on the Wooden Box: How the Impossible Became Possible . . . on Schindler's List.

Colours that the \\"R-Spec\\" Typhoon was released in included Winter White, Lightning Strike, Vixen, Neo, Ego, Bionic and Silhouette. Apart from their badging, \\"R-Spec\\" Typhoons can be identified by their Thurderstorm Grey inserts seen on the front and rear bumper bars, fog light surrounds, rear spoiler pillars and alloy wheels. The \\"R-Spec\\" model was also available as a special order in custom option colour choices. At least 9 units are known to be painted in Ford's Conquer Blue metallic with Dark Argent inserts. The BF F6 is the only non V8-engined \\"R-Spec\\" product ever made by FPV. = GT \\"Cobra\\" = In 2008, FPV released a total of 400 Cobra \\"R-Spec\\" sedans (plus 100 FPV Super Pursuit \\"Cobra\\" utes not badged \\"GT\\" or \\"R-Spec\\"), which featured a distinctive blue on white paint scheme seen on the XC series Falcon Cobra models of 1978. Relative to other FPV models, power was increased to (up from ), making this the only \\"R-Spec\\" to feature both the upgraded handling package and engine upgrade. On release, FPV dealers were charging vastly more (up to an additional $44,000) than the recommended retail price, with early buyers also selling their cars at a premium. This Cobra model has since become highly collectable.http://www.uniquecarsmag.com.au/news-and- reviews/article/articleid/80208.aspx File:2007 FPV F6 Typhoon (BF II) R Spec sedan (2007-10-06) 01.jpgF6 Typhoon \\"R-Spec\\" File: FPV BF GT 40th Anniversary.jpgGT \\"40th Anniversary\\" File: Cobra R-spec.jpgCobra \\"R-Spec\\"  FG series = GT \\"R-Spec\\" = In 2011, FPV presented the GT \\"Black\\" at the Sydney Motor Show,.Drive.com.au The car featured not only a new look but wheels and suspension changes. The car that went on sale unfortunately was reduced to a simple blacked out paint job and a new matte black strip kit.http://www.caradvice.com.au/131492/2011-fpv-gt-black-limited-edition-on- sale-in-australia-125-only/ It wasn't until the R-Spec arrived a year later that the concept changes started to appear. In 2012 FPV released codename \\"Panther\\", a new track-focused \\"GT R-Spec\\", using the current \\"GT\\" with its / supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, in so doing creating Australia's fastest accelerating production car.http://motoring.ninemsn.com.au/cars/features/8545639/wheels-magazine-fpv- gt-r-spec Although rated at , actual engine outputs were closer to , with many production models running up at the rear wheels when dyno-tested. For many enthusiasts, this GT \\"R-Spec\\" is seen as the spiritual successor of the original \\"GT-HO\\" models that ended with the 1971 Ford XY Falcon GT. Ford (and FPV), however, have always remained reluctant to recycle the \\"HO\\" nameplate on its modern-day products. The GT R-Spec is still the fastest ever Australian produced Ford over the 1/4mile. A raft of changes included a launch control system, stiffer engine and transmission mounts and retuned suspension. The suspension gained stiffer upper control arm bushes, stiffer upper strut mounts and retuned dampers at the front, with the rear gaining higher spring rates, retuned dampers, a larger anti-roll bar and reinforced lower control arms. The rear also gained a wider 9-inch wheel package shod with 275/30 R19 tyres and revised toe-link settings.http://www.caradvice.com.au/185969/fpv-gt-rspec- fastest-ever-falcon-launches/ This \\"R-Spec\\" also ended up being a louder car than the regular GT and GT-P despite no particular changes to that effect. The R-Spec split public and owners on not only looks but the package as well. For the first and only time Ford/FPV produced a car with major changes in drive and handling. Many existing FPV owners were quick to down play what was actually quiet a good package which significantly improved drive and performance. In total, 175 units were built painted Silhouette black with red accents and a \\"C\\" stripe down each side, echoing the 2012 Ford Mustang \\"302 Boss\\" Laguna Seca. Kinetic blue, Vixen and Winter white were the other colours available to order, featuring black accents and stripe package instead. The NSW Police Force received a Winter White \\"R-Spec\\" (build no. 150) to commemorate its 150th Anniversary in 2012. With the power upgraded to , it was the most powerful Australian highway patrol car ever that has been used for public liaison and awareness purposes at motorsport events across the state.http://www.themotorreport.com.au/55488/400kw-fpv-gt-rspec-joins-nsw- police-fleet File:GT R-spec.jpgThe GT \\"R-Spec\\" inspired on the Ford Mustang \\"302 Boss\\" Laguna Seca File:R-spec NSW police.jpgThe GT \\"R-Spec\\" patrol car of the NSW Police ;Performance * 1/4 mile 12.5 at * 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 4.5 seconds These times better those set by the rival HSV W427 in 2008,http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=49262 then at the time Australia's quickest production car. Owners have run as quick as 12.1 over the 1/4 mile and 4.3s to 100 km/h. =FG GT-F \\"351\\"= In 2014, as a final send-off for the GT, FPV released 550 examples of the GT-F \\"351\\". This time, however, \\"351\\" nameplate which was used as a tribute to the original Ford Falcon GTs referred to the engine output in kW rather than the forebear's historic cubic capacity. The GT-F received all the suspension and drivetrain upgrades from the FG \\"R-Spec\\", coupled with an engine featuring a 4% increase remap tune to bring an output to (with an \\"over-boost function\\" bringing power to over for short periods, dependent on conditions) around 10-15 kW (13-20 hp) more at the rear wheels. From the outside, the GT-F borrowed the visual features of the preceding \\"R-Spec\\" without, however, bearing that badge. It featured a unique stripe kit consisting of a single stripe over the top of the car's body, and the black painted accents on specific areas of the car. Despite the extra engine power, the GT-F was no faster than previous \\"R-Spec\\" cars in either a 0-100 sprint or over the 1/4mile during extensive media testing. http://www.themotorreport.com.au/59098/fpv-gtf-351-the-last-falcon- gt-arrives Ford and FPV's limited development budget saw this project completed in just 2 months. The last GT-F unit numbered 500 (50 units went to NZ) was sold on an eBay charity auction for $234,000 and featured a one-off colour and personalised features for the winning bidder.

Corah and Sons was a manufacturer of hosiery and textiles, located in Leicester in the United Kingdom. At one time it was the largest knitwear producer in Europe, and its products had a major influence on the development and prosperity of the Marks & Spencer chain of retail stores.Clark 2002, p. 198.  History of the firm = Nathaniel Corah = The company was founded by Nathaniel Corah at the Globe Inn, Silver Street, in Leicester – a building which still survives, and which at that time was closely associated with the city's stockingers.Room 1982, p. 152. Corah's business model was to buy completed stockings in Leicester, and to sell them elsewhere at a profit.Jopp 1965, p. 7. The majority of Corah's sales were in Birmingham, and he maintained a stock room in another public house there.Webb 1947, p. 14. The business soon grew, and its own premises on Union Street in Leicester were purchased in 1824. The company remained at these premises until 1845. In 1830, Corah's three sons – John, Thomas and William – were taken into partnership. The name of the firm became Nathaniel Corah & Sons.Webb 1947, p. 16. = St Margaret's Works = In 1855, Thomas Corah & Sons had 2000 knitting frames, making it one of the largest hosiery firms in the country.Chapman 2006, p. 229. By 1865, its premises on Granby Street had become too small, and so the company decided to move. A site was chosen north of the town centre, in the parish of St Margaret and close to the River Soar. Large new premises were built: the main warehouses was 160 feet long and 50 feet wide. At the rear was the factory, an even larger building, the dimensions of which were 294 by 80 feet. The 140-foot chimney was attached to the factory. The works were driven by a large steam powered beam engine, which was started for the first time on 13 July 1865.Webb 1947, p. 20.Stocker 2006, p. 229. By this time the firm had expanded its product range beyond hosiery. In the 1870s, for instance, it began producing football and rugby jerseys, in addition to a range of men and women's garments.Webb 1947, p. 33. = Relationship with Marks & Spencer = The firm was the first company to develop a relationship with Marks & Spencer, a well-known British retailer. The latter's St Michael brand, which it used from 1928 until 2000, was inspired by Corah's use of \\"St Margaret\\" as a label for its clothing. The \\"St Margaret\\" label was one of the first trademarks to be registered under the 1875 Trademarks Registration Act, and it appeared on products sold in Marks & Spencer outlets until after the Second World War.Worth 2007, p. 96. One advantage of this close relationship was that Marks & Spencer could reduce costs by cutting out the middle man, in this case wholesalers.Worth 2007, p. 40–1. However, the relationship initially brought with it a considerable danger for Corah: the risk of being blacklisted by the Wholesale Textile Association (WTA). Corah referred to Marks & Spencer in its accounts only in coded terms as an attempt to avoid this, but eventually the WTA became aware of the relationship and removed Corah's name from its list of approved suppliers. Soon other manufacturers began to deal with retailers directly, and so the impact of being blacklisted was limited. The advantage of dealing directly with Marks & Spencer was that it allowed longer production runs to be organised, which were more profitable, and allowed manufacturer and retailer to work together closely to produce high-quality products. This quality was a hallmark of the \\"St Michael\\" brand. Corah maintained a design room until at least until 1973, which enabled it to present customers such as Marks & Spencer with designs for finished products such as dresses.Worth 2007, p. 70. It even sent clothes to Marks & Spencer already arranged by size so that they could go straight into the store. In the 1970s, the company's trade with Marks & Spencer was worth £20 million per annum – and Corah celebrated the \\"golden anniversary\\" of the relationship in 1976. In the twentieth century, Corah expanded beyond Leicester to open branch factories in Barnsley, Scunthorpe, Oakham and Barrie, Ontario.  Working at Corah  The St Margaret's Works were a major employer in the city of Leicester. Corah had over a thousand employees in 1900, many of whom were female.Evans 1970, p. 65. The size of the company was such that 330 male employees participated in the First World War. Forty were killed. At the same time, 70 per cent of Corah's output went to the war effort.Webb 1947, pp. 57, 59. For a list of names of those killed, see the memorial plaque which was erected at Corah. The Second World War also had an important effect on Corah – it took away the firm's female workers, which led to a skills shortage once peace had resumed. This led the company to introduce specialist training for the first time in the post-war era.Jopp 1965, p. 37. Workers at Corah had many opportunities to participate in the wider social life of the factory. The Corah works maintained several competitive sports teams, and working at the factory was – according to those who worked there – to be part of a close-knit community in which birthdays and other important occasions were celebrated. The British Legion also maintained its own branch at the Corah works in the post-war period.Corah Employee handbook, 1954, section 57. Closure Into the 1960s, Corah's employed over 6,000 workers, making it one of the largest factories in the city. But the UK hosiery industry fell into severe difficulties following the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s. Corah's and its competitors were faced with changing tastes and foreign competition. It had to borrow to reinvest at the same time as having to keep prices low - and, in the inflationary 1970s - pay their workers more. I worked with Corah firstly as a student from 1970 to 1973. At that time every week CORAH manufactured about 100,000 dozen pair of gents half hose, 7000 dozen full fashioned knitwear garments mostly ladies and about 4000 dozen cut and sew garments both gents and ladies. This amounted to approximately 100,000 kg of knitted goods, most of which went to M&S; stores in the UK. Corah lost its last link with the founding family in 1989 and in the same year it was sold to Australian corporate raider Charterhall and was broken up shortly afterwards after Charterhall crashed to a huge loss. By the 1990s the factory had closed.  The Corah building after company closure  Today parts of the monumental factory are still used by small scale hosiery manufacture. But much of the site is now derelict and the boiler house chimney has been demolished. It is not a listed building. Its iconic nature and it relative openness to casual visitors has meant it has become a favourite of so-called Urban Explorers. Exindustria - a lament for Leicester's lost industrial power - was shot partly at Corah's. The statue of St Margaret which formerly stood above the main entrance was removed to nearby St Margaret's church in 1995. In April 2012, the Corah building suffered a fire.http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/crews-battle-huge-blazes-Leicester- VIDEO/story-15890583-detail/story.html#axzz2cW4JAlmk In May 2016, a fire engulfed a large, but derelict part of the building, damage was restricted to the inside of the building  Notes  References    – available at My Leicestershire (Manufacturing Pasts collection)  * – available at My Leicestershire (Manufacturing Pasts collection) * Further reading Bramwell G Rudd COURTAULDS and the HOSIERY & KNITWEAR INDUSTRY (Carnegie Publishing Ltd) (2014, ISBN softback 978-1-905472-06-2, hardback 978-1-905472-18-5)  External links  *Printed and archival materials relating to the history of Corah, on the My Leicestershire website. *Corah of Leicester – website about the history of Corah and the St Margaret's Works. *Oral history of deindustrialisation in Leicester, with several interviews of former Corah employees, on the University of Leicester's Manufacturing Pasts webpage. *Social Life of the Factory, with particular reference to Corah – Manufacturing Pasts.

It is the only MIDI controller in the MPK series to feature hammer-weighted keys. It can be connected to a computer via a bus-powered USB port, or with traditional MIDI cables (in which case an external power adapter is required). Controls and Features The MPK88 features the following customizable controls: *8 short- travel faders: the minimum and maximum range of these faders can be adjusted for more precise control of certain MIDI data types. *8 continuous encoders/knobs: the minimum and maximum range of these faders can be adjusted for more precise control of certain MIDI data types. *8 buttons: these can operate as a momentary switch, or as a toggle switch to turn a MIDI control code (such as Sustain) on or off. They can also be assigned to functions within a sequencer or DAW. *16 velocity-sensitive pads: these are modeled after the traditional MPC-style pads and by default are set up to trigger different MIDI notes that would correspond to different samples loaded inside the user's sequencer software. The pads also support channel aftertouch, where if a pad is held down after the initial strike, the player can adjust the amount of pressure on the pad to produce a variety of different effects. When the Note Repeat function is active while holding the pad down, the sample will play back repeatedly according to the time division set. *Modulation and Pitchbend wheels: the modwheel can be reassigned to a different controller event. *Dedicated sequencer/DAW remote buttons: these can be set up to use MIDI, MMC, or both. As most other controllers in the MPK series, the MPK88 also has a built-in arpeggiator, with the 8 buttons acting as the time division for the beat. When this is active, user-programmed settings for the 8 buttons are ignored. Editing Parameters Screenshot of the Vyzex Preset Editor All of the MPK's controls (with the exception of the pitch-bend wheel) are programmable by the user.

Broad and narrow definitions exist for the concept, both of which have been used to explain violence (including war) and crime, on either a micro or macro scale. Conflicting values Jonathan H. Turner defines cultural conflict as a conflict caused by \\"differences in cultural values and beliefs that place people at odds with one another.\\" On a micro level, Alexander Grewe discusses a cultural conflict between guests of different culture and nationality as seen in a British 1970 sitcom, Fawlty Towers. He defines this conflict as one that occurs when people's expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met, as others have different cultural backgrounds and different expectations. Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs. Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in politics, particularly on a macro level. An example of cultural conflict is the debate over abortion. Ethnic cleansing is another extreme example of cultural conflict. Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on slavery were one of the reasons for the American civil war. Crime and deviance A more narrow definition of a cultural conflict dates to Daniel Bell's 1962 essay, \\"Crime as an American Way of Life\\", and focuses on criminal-enabling consequences of a clash in cultural values. William Kornblum defines it as a conflict that occurs when conflicting norms create \\"opportunities for deviance and criminal gain in deviant subcultures.\\" Kornblum notes that, whenever laws impose cultural values on a group that does not share those views (often, this is the case of the majority imposing their laws on a minority), illegal markets supplied by criminals are created to circumvent those laws. He discusses the example of prohibition in the interbellum United States, and notes how the cultural conflict between pro- and anti-alcohol groups created opportunities for illegal activity; another similar example he lists is that of the war on drugs. Kornblum also classifies the cultural conflict as one of the major types of conflict theory. In The Clash of Civilizations Samuel P. Huntington proposes that people's cultural and religious identities will be the primary source of conflict in the post-Cold War world. Influence and understanding Michelle LeBaron describes different cultures as \\"underground rivers that run through our lives and relationships, giving us messages that shape our perceptions, attributions, judgments, and ideas of self and other.\\" She states that cultural messages \\"shape our understandings\\" when two or more people are present in regards to relationships, conflict, and peace. LeBaron discusses the influence of culture as being powerful and \\"unconscious, influencing conflict and attempts to resolve conflict in imperceptible ways.\\" She states that the impact of culture is huge, affecting \\"name, frame, blame, and attempt to tame conflicts.\\" Due to the huge impact that culture has on us, LeBaron finds it important to explain the \\"complications of conflict:\\" * First, \\"culture is multi-layered,\\" meaning that \\"what you see on the surface may mask differences below the surface.\\" * Second, \\"culture is constantly in flux,\\" meaning that \\"cultural groups adapt in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable ways.\\" * Third, \\"culture is elastic,\\" meaning that one member of a cultural group may not participate in the norms of the culture. * Lastly, \\"culture is largely below the surface,\\" meaning that it isn't easy to reach the deeper levels of culture and its meanings.

Reverend Samuel George Pinnock was directed by the Mission to set up a post primary school to educate children from the three feeder primary schools. In 1916 Pinnock identified and chose the site, Egunya Hill, and negotiated the purchase of the land. The building of the school was delayed because of the effect of World War I on the cost of building materials. However, in early 1922 Pinnock oversaw the construction of the Principal's Quarters, which also doubled as Abeokuta Mission House; a block of five classrooms, a chapel, and a dormitory for boys. In 1922 Pinnock selected a group of advanced students from the three feeder primary schools at Ago-Owu, Ago-Ijaye and Oke-saje, and these formed the first class of the school. He opened Baptist Boys’ High School on January 23, 1923, with 75 students and four teachers (including his wife, Madora Pinnock). The opening ceremony attracted 2000 guests. The guest speaker was Professor Nathaniel Oyerinde, a teacher at the Baptist Academy, Ogbomoso, and Nigeria's first Baptist Professor.Ademola, A. S.

This was the 17th by-election since the first election, and the second by- election in as many years. The Nomination Day was held on 16 January 2013, while Polling Day was on 26 January 2013. This was also returning officer, Yam Ah Mee's last stint, following his resignation from the People's Association. On 26 January 2013, Lee Li Lian of the Workers' Party was elected as the Member of Parliament for Punggol East SMC, marking the second by-election victory for an opposition party after 1981. Background The by-election was called by President Tony Tan Keng Yam at the advice of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong after the seat of Punggol East was left vacant when then the incumbent, then Speaker of Parliament Michael Palmer, resigned from his seat due to him having an extramarital affair. A local tabloid, The New Paper, reported that they received a tip-off on 8 December 2012, in the form of screengrabs of phone messages that the Speaker of Parliament, Michael Palmer was having an extramarital affair. The messages suggested that the two had close relationship and met regularly on Mondays. The New Paper also stated that they have been in this relationship for a year. On the same Saturday, Palmer met DPM Teo Chee Hean to tender his resignation as speaker and MP. The next day, PM Lee Hsien Loong met Palmer to confirm his resignation. On 12 December 2012, the PAP called a press conference where Palmer announced that he resigned to \\"take full responsibility for a grave mistake\\" for having an improper relationship with a PA staff working in the Pasir Ris West constituency office, Laura Ong. Although Ong did not work under Palmer, Punggol East belonged to the Pasir Ris-Punggol division and Punggol East still works together on constituencies affairs. Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean announced at the press conference announced that Teo Ser Luck will be the interim MP for Punggol East, while Zainal Sapari would be the new chairman for the Pasir Ris-Punggol town council. Deputy Speaker Charles Chong served as the Acting Speaker until 14 January 2013 where Halimah Yacob became the new speaker. =Confirmation of by-election= On 9 January 2013, President Tony Tan Keng Yam issued a writ of election for the electoral division of Punggol East. The nominations was held on 16 January at North Vista Secondary School and voting took place on 26 January. Candidates On 10 January 2013, PAP unveiled their candidate to stand in the by-election, Dr Koh Poh Koon, a 40-year-old colorectal surgeon from Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre. Four days later, WP unveiled a previously-contested candidate Lee Li Lian. In a press statement to the media on 15 January 2013, the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) announced secretary-general Desmond Lim as its candidates. At a news conference outside Rivervale Plaza later on the evening, the Reform Party (RP) announce that chief Kenneth Jeyaretnam will be the fourth candidate. The Singapore Democratic Party initially expressed interest in contesting the election, even proposing a joint campaign with the WP, but on 15 January, the SDP announced its decision not to contest the by-election and backed WP. There were potential independent candidates who declared their intentions to run. They included former People's Liberal Democratic Party founder Ooi Boon Ewe, retired acupuncturist Zeng Guoyuan and former Singapore People's Party member Benjamin Pwee, who later pulled out of the race, citing the lack of time to run under a party banner as a reason for pulling out. Results Before results were announced, SDA's Desmond Lim conceded at about 10.42pm (SGT) thanking his supporters and vowed to 'keep SDA's flame alive' in the next election. Results were announced on 10.57pm (SGT) where WP's Lee was declared candidate-elect with a 54.52% out of 29,415 valid votes, beating PAP's rival Koh with a 43.71% vote. Two candidates had forfeited their $14,500 election deposit, namely Kenneth Jeyaretnam and Desmond Lim with 1.20% and 0.57% of the votes respectively, with the latter becoming the second candidate to have his election deposit forfeited twice since Harbans Singh,Candidates name list (H-I): Harbans Singh and setting a record-low vote share surpassing Teo Kim Hoe's former record of 196 votes or 0.81%, in post-independence Singapore; Lim's vote count would later be shattered in the 2015 elections by another candidate, Samir Salim Neji, with 150 votes or 0.60%. Overseas votes were tabulated four days after the by-election, on 30 January, seeing a 0.02% change in the top two parties after Koh and Lee received 19 and 7 votes respectively (there is only one spoilt and 32 abstained votes). The results are as follows: Aftermath The election had seen another setback for the PAP since the formation of the 12th Parliament after the 2011 election where WP won Aljunied GRC. WP subsequently made history with Lee becoming the first female MP in post-independence to helm a SMC and the second female opposition MP to do so after WP's chair Sylvia Lim. It was also the second by-election since 1981 in which PAP lost a parliamentary seat of Anson SMC during the term to the opposition. Lee was sworn-in to parliament a week later on 4 February. Prime Minister Lee congratulated WP for the victory and respected the voter's decision, and further cited that in a by-election, voters were seen choosing for an MP and not government, and encouraged them to vote for the opposition. He then announced that the government will now focus on current national issues in Parliament including the Population White Paper and the annual Budget statement, and mentioned that the PAP are prepared for a long term with time to deliver results, and would continue to work to improve the lives of Singaporeans, and present the report card for voters to judge in the next general election. In the 2015 elections, PAP's Koh would be MP-elect for the Yio Chu Kang division under Ang Mo Kio GRC (and later Tampines GRC in 2020), but Lee was unable to retain the seat for a second term and returning Punggol East to the PAP-fold which was won by Joo Chiat SMC candidate Charles Chong in a narrow winning margin. Punggol East SMC would be defunct on a redistricting of boundaries in the 2020 elections under a new constituency of Sengkang GRC; WP would go on to win the GRC, eventually returning Punggol East (now renamed to Rivervale) back to the WP-fold.

He was one of the early propagators of his father Dawud al-Zahiri's method in jurisprudence, Zahirism. Life=Youth and education= Ibn Dawud was born in Baghdad in the year 255 according to the Islamic calendar, corresponding roughly to the year 868 according to the Gregorian calendar. By the age of seven, he had memorized the entire Qur'an by heart.Louis Massignon, The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 167. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. By the age of ten, he was already an exemplary student in the fields of Arabic grammar, lexicography and Arabic literature under his teacher Niftawayh, himself a student of Ibn Dawud's father.Devin J. Stewart, \\"Muhammad b. Dawud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence.\\" Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by Bernard G. Weiss. Pg. 114. Leiden: 2002. Brill Publishers. In regard to the variant readings of the Qur'an, Ibn Dawud learned from Al-Duri, a student of Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala', one of the ten primary transmitters of the Qur'an.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, History of the Prophets and Kings, trans. Franz Rosenthal. Vol. 1: General Introduction and From the Creation to the Flood, pg. 58. Albany: SUNY Press, 1989. Ibn Dawud's classmate, Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, also learned the Qur'an from the same study circle in addition to having been a student of Ibn Dawud's father, suggesting a close relationship early on, despite their later rivalry. Ibn Dawud's relationship with his father was complex. As a child, Ibn Dawud was bullied by other children, being given the name \\"poor little sparrow.\\" When he complained to his father about the nickname, his father insisted that names of people and things are predestined by God; there was no reason to analyze the meaning of names in order to know that they had been established. His father then actually affirmed the nickname given by the other children, emphasizing that all things occur according to divine will. While Ibn Dawud told his father that he was as mean as the other children were for laughing at his own son, it is not known if this episode continued to affect Ibn Dawud into adulthood, or if this was characteristic of the entire father-son relationship. =Academia and judiciary= Upon his father's death in 884, Ibn Dawud took up Dawud's teaching position in Baghdad.J.C. Vadet, Ibn Dāwūd. Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 9 January 2013Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers, pg. 34. New Delhi: Ashish Publishing House, 1994. Despite being only fifteen years old, he was still considered an outstanding jurist, and the four-hundred or so students of his father became his own students. Ibn Dawud had a tendency to speak using Saj', a form of Arabic rhymed prose, in everyday speech. This caused difficulty for many who sought verdicts from him, though it is not regarded as having lessened his popularity. Some years after his teaching position, the Abbasid administration appointed him to a judicial post in western Baghdad. =Death= Although Ibn Dawud is generally considered to have died young, his exact date of death has been a matter of some dispute. Masudi recorded Ibn Dawud's death at 296 Hijri, corresponding to 908 or 909 Gregorian. The Encyclopaedia of Islam records his death as 294 Hijri and 909 Gregorian, yet the two dates do not match. Ibn Khallikan recorded Ibn Dawud's death as Ramadan 9, 297 Hijri, or May 22, 910 Gregorian. While the exact cause of death is not known, Ibn Dawud proclaimed a deathbed confession to his teacher Niftawayh that he was dying of a broken heart, due to a forbidden love for another man.Lois Anita Giffen, \\"Ibn Hazm and the Tawq al-Hamama. Taken from The Legacy of Muslim Spain, pg. 425. Ed. Salma Jayyusi. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1994. The topic of Ibn Dawud's affections has been the topic of much discussion, as his confession of such feelings is unique among Muslim theologians even up to the present era. The setting of his death has been perhaps the most vividly described piece of his biography. During his final moments, Ibn Dawud lied on a bed between the light filtering in through the grated window and the empty space of the floor as a blind nightingale sang in a gilded cage nearby; he was described as weary with regrets, yet also serene in his last moments.Masiggnon, pgs. 168–169.Jeffrey J. Kripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom: Eroticism and Reflexivity in the Study of Mysticism, pg. 132. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001. His body was ritually washed by his student Ibn al-Mughallis according to Islamic funeral rites. Philosophy Ibn Dawud was an opponent of using analogical reason and juristic preference in Muslim jurisprudence.Qadi al-Nu'man, Differences Among the Schools of Law, pg. 161. At the same time, Ibn Dawud still upheld the validity of using inference in order to deduce religious verdicts.Nu'man, pg. 193. The same views were held by his father, whom Ibn Dawud followed in his Zahirite religious views. Ibn Dawud also rejected the notion that verdicts of the first generation of Muslims could constitute a source of law.Stewart, pg. 125. This position is not specific to the Zahirite rite, being the preferred view of the Shafi'ites as well. Theology Like his father, Ibn Dawud has not left theological works which have survived to the modern era. Ibn Dawud was known to have been involved in public debates with the Mu'tazila, an ancient Muslim sect, in a court of the caliph Al-Muwaffaq in Wasit.Massignon, pg. 18. This is not surprising considering the Mu'tazilites ill reception of Ibn Dawud's father, in whose footsteps Ibn Dawud followed, and the scorn which the Mu'taziltes heaped upon Zahirites in general. More is known about what Ibn Dawud opposed theologically rather than what he himself believed. =Nature of the soul= In his book on love, Ibn Dawud quoted Greek playwright Aristophanes who, according to Plato's Symposium, held the view that the soul of a person who had fallen in love was actually only half a soul. In this view, the bodies of two people in love were each given only half of the same soul by God. Later writers have mistaken this for being Ibn Dawud's own belief, though modern scholarship has shown that he was merely quoting the speech of philosophers in an almost derisive way rather than ascribing to the belief himself.Max Weisweiller, Halsband der Taube, uber die Liebe und die Liebenden. Pg. 19. Leiden: 1944. Ibn Dawud's own beliefs regarding the soul were never actually stated, and were likely no different from those held by the rest of Islamic orthodoxy at the time. =Anathematisation of al-Hallaj= In 901, he declared the mystic Mansur Al-Hallaj as a heretic in a well-known verdict.John Renard, The A to Z of Sufism, pg. xxvi. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. Initially, Ibn Dawud's appeal to the caliph Al-Mu'tadid was not heeded, and Hallaj was able to continue preaching his ideas for a time.Massignon, pg. 14. It is likely, however, that Ibn Dawud's verdict was one contributing factor to the caliph Al-Muqtadir's ordering of Hallaj's execution. Reception Historically, Shi'ite writers and especially Ismaili Shi'ites have criticized Ibn Dawud for rejecting the usage of analogical reason and juristic preference in religious verdicts while affirming inference. Fatimid historian Qadi al-Nu'man was particularly scathing, accusing Ibn Dawud and his father of contradicting themselves. Works=Jurisprudence= Ibn Dawud composed a book on the topic of the principles of Muslim jurisprudence titled The Path to Knowledge of Jurisprudence. It was one of the earliest works on the subject after Shafi'i's Risala, and the primary basis for Nu'man's Differences Among the Schools of Law, despite Nu'man's criticisms of Ibn Dawud.Stewart, pg. 100. Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions that in a chapter of the book regarding juristic consensus, Ibn Dawud criticizes his former companion Tabari as having contradictory views on the subject.Yaqut al-Hamawi, Dictionary of Writers, vol. 18, pg. 32. Like Ibn Dawud's other works, The Path has not survived on complete form to the modern era; however, large tracts of it are quoted in other works and modern scholarship suggests that al-Nu'man's Differences was derived from Ibn Dawud's book. Despite their differences in opinion, Tabari's own work on the principles of jurisprudence, The Clarification of the Principles of Verdicts, was strongly resemblant of The Path of Ibn Dawud and the works of Dawud's father, rather than Shafi'is work or even post-9th century works on the topic.Devin Stewart, \\"Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari's al-Bayan 'an Usul al-Ahkam and the Genre of Usul al-Fiqh in Ninth Century Baghdad,\\" pg. 337. Taken from Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6–10 January 2002. Edited by James Montgomery. Leuven: Peeters Publishers and the Department of Oriental Studies, 2004. This not only contradicts the common theme within the genre, but also implies similarities between the extant yet non-mainstream Zahirite school of law, and the extinct Jariri school. In addition to The Path, Masudi and Ibn al-Nadim both attribute three other works to Ibn Dawud within the field of Muslim jurisprudence: the Book of Admonishment, the Book of Excuse and the Book of Refutation.Al- Masudi's The Meadows of Gold, translated by Aloys Sprenger. Vol. 4, pg. 272. Printed for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland. Sold by W.H. Allen and Co. (now Virgin Books), Leadenhall Street, and B. Duprat, Paris. Bibliotheca Regia Monacensis. London: Garrison and Co. Printers, St Martin's Lane.Ibn al-Nadim, al-Fihrist, page 363. The latter book includes another critique of the views Tabari. =Divine Love= In the late 9th century, Ibn Dawud composed his book Kitab al-Zahrah while in his native city of Baghdad.Roger Boase, \\"Arab Influences of European Love-Poetry.\\" Taken from The Legacy of Muslim Spain, pg. 460. Ed. Salma Jayyusi. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1994. His work is considered to be one of the first Arabic language works on the theory of love, though only the first half is concerned with this: the second half is an anthology of poetry.Lara Harb, 'Beyond the Known Limits: Ibn Dāwūd al-Iṣfahānī's Chapter on \\"Intermedial\\" Poetry', in Arabic Humanities, Islamic Thought: Essays in Honor of Everett K. Rowson, ed. by Joseph Lowry, Shawkat Toorawa, Islamic History and Civilisation: Studies and Texts, 141 (Leiden: Brill, 2017), pp. 122-49 (p. 122); . Ibn Duraid, who authored the second ever comprehensive dictionary of the language, ranked this book along with the treatises on love by Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur and Ibn Qutaybah as the three most important works for one who wanted to become eloquent in speaking and writing.Shawkat M. Toorawa, \\"Defing Adab by re-defining the Adib: Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur and storytelling.\\" Taken from On Fiction and Adab in Medieval Arabic Literature, pg. 303. Ed. Philip F. Kennedy. Volume 6 of Studies in Arabic language and literature. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. Shawkat M. Toorawa, \\"Ibn Abi Tayfur versus al-Jahiz.\\" Taken from ʻAbbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of ʻAbbasid Studies, pg. 250. Ed. James Edward Montgomery. Volume 135 of Orientalia Lovaniensia analecta. Peeters Publishers, 2004. The book is organized as an anthology, with each chapter headed by an appropriate aphorism and being devoted to various phenomena relating to the true meaning of love.Giffen, pg. 424. Although he wrote from more of a humanistic perspective than a theological one, Ibn Dawud's piety was apparent, as chastity was a common theme. Chapter eight of the book, \\"A refined person will be chaste,\\" is opened with an alleged quote from the prophet Muhammad in praise of admirers who keep their affections secret. Similarly, the opening chapter is titled \\"he whose glances are many, his sorrows are prolonged,\\" indicating a belief that pursuing multiple objects of affection will yield negative results. The martyrdom of chastity is a repeated theme, as is Ibn Dawud's denial of the possibility of divine-human mutual love. Incomplete portions of the book are still extant today, though not widely available. Editions * Ibn Dāwūd al-Iṣfahānī, Abū Bakr Muḥammad b.

Homer painted African Americans, completely avoiding the stereotypes with which their collective image had been flooded during the period of Reconstruction after the American Civil War. The 1870s and 1880s produced innumerable images of African Americans at carnival time, mindless, jolly, condescending. But Homer's Dressing for the Carnival is unlike all of them: a deeply nuanced and, in the end, tragic scene of preparation for festivity. A group of people is preparing for the African- American festival known in the South as Jonkonnu and in the North as Pinkster. It entailed the costuming of a Harlequin-like figure or Lord of Misrule, and this Homer depicts: a man caparisoned in bright, tatterdemalion clothes, yellow, red, and blue, with a liberty cap on his head. Two women are sewing them on him. The one on the right extends her arm, pulling the long thread right through, in a gesture of compelling and somber gravity; she is a classical Fate, seen below the Mason-Dixon line. Next to her, but apart from her, gazing at the vesting ceremony with wonder, are some children, one of whom holds a Stars and Stripes (for by Reconstruction, the rituals of the Fourth of July had been overlaid on those of Jonkonnu). Homer makes us sense how far the hopes of emancipation still are from the realities of black life in the South.Robert Hughes, American Visions, The Epic History of Art in America, Alfred A.

Starting in the years after his graduation in 1952 and until after the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, he conceived a significant number of buildings and city plans in Romania and abroad.  Biography  His father, Alexandre Lăzărescu, was an army corps colonel often on duty far from Bucharest. His mother, Sophia Lăzărescu Georgescu, was a housewife. Having attended an art school herself, she also taught him how to draw and paint. = 1930 – 1956 : School years and first works = After attending a small public school, where the short illustrated fairy tale books he wrote brought him the admiration of his teachers and classmates, he was admitted to the Gheorghe Lazăr National College, one of the best high schools in Bucharest. Inspired by the exciting environment and the many extracurricular activities, he performed very well in school. He contributed to several art exhibitions organised by his high school and in 1942 opened his own exhibition at the Athenaeum, a prestigious venue. His college years were over the background of World War II and the post-war era, during which he and his mother Sophia had to struggle to make ends meet. Nevertheless, he had remarkable academic achievements and was also involved in numerous extracurricular professional and social activities. In the early 1950s he was drafted to the Danube – Black Sea canal works, where he was put in charge of a team of young architects who were commissioned to design workers' lodgings close to Cernavodă, near the seaside. He worked next on healthcare facilities and holiday camps in North and South Eforie, on the shores of Lake Techirghiol, and in Mangalia. Socialist realism, the mandatory architectural style for any public building of this period, led to the production of cheap-looking housing projects, decorated in a pompous faux- classical way that was meant to put on display the \\"luxurious life\\" of the working class. This architectural style (of which the Moscow State University and its clones such as the \\"Casa Scînteii\\" in Bucharest were prime examples) were mandated by law in all countries within the Soviet Bloc. Any public building or dwelling was required to be done in this style. Restaurant \\"Perla Mării\\" in North Eforie 21 hotels and 8 restaurants, shops, bars and clubs in Mamaia = 1957 – 1961 : Development of the Black Sea coast = The paid vacation time introduced by the \\"workers' union\\"See article on the Romanian Communist Party for details. gave rise to a pressing need to create, in just a few months' time, an impressive number of beds in tourist residences on the Black Sea coast. A local Party leader asked the team led by Lăzărescu to build a hotel complex for the \\"worker's union\\" in North Eforie by the beginning of the summer. Faced with an apparently unsolvable problem (building over one thousand beds on an insufficient budget and within an unreasonably short time), with little \\"political oversight\\" (since the actual political battles are fought far away in Bucharest), Lăzărescu created, with his team, a vast building complex in a style reminiscent of American architecture, very far from the socialist realism required by law. An investigation followed, with the looming threat of a prison sentence. Along with the local Party leader, Lăzărescu was summoned to the office of the First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. To Lăzărescu's surprise, Gheorghiu-Dej congratulated him, telling him how pleased he was with the result. Subsequently, Gheorghiu-Dej appointed Lăzărescu to lead the development of the Romanian Black Sea coast. This was to become the main building effort that would put an end to socialist realism. In the following period, Lăzărescu developed the Southern coast in the areas of Eforie, Lake Techirghiol, and Mangalia (tourist residences and health facilities including balneotherapy), and the Northern seaside in the area of Mamaia (only tourist residences and entertainment). Sewage facilities, roads, and energy distribution networks in these areas were rudimentary at best, so the team needed to rebuild everything from scratch. \\"Lake 2\\" villa in Bucharest Floreasca Hotel Europe in North Eforie The team led by Lăzărescu comprised many talented architects who would later become very well known, such as A. Borgovan, V. Ghiorghiu, G. Cristea, D. Ghiorghiu, A. Coveianu, L. Popovici, T. Adam, V. Petrea, Stopler and many others. Held together by the magnitude of the challenge and the largely shared vision of a modern architecture, the team created a number of remarkable buildings. Many of these have maintained their modern, almost minimalistic character even today, due to the purity of their shapes and the fluidity of the architectural expression. Examples include the \\"Perla Mării\\" restaurant,See the INFOROM website. the vacation camps located between North and South Eforie, the \\"Melody\\" bar and casino, the Villa Marina, and others). The technical approach is as daring as the aesthetic one: Mamaia was built on a very low stretch of sand between the lake and the sea, which required building an innovative sewage system. = 1961 – 1965 : Luxury villas = Three presidential villas in North Eforie At the same time as the development of the Black Sea coast, Lăzărescu was put in charge of building luxury villas for the government, initially on the seaside, in North Eforie and Mamaia, later in Bucharest and in other parts of the country. These luxury villas were built with materials supplied by French and Italian companies such as Perrier- Rolin, Zilli, or Barovier & Toso in Murano. Along with the design of the Otopeni International Airport, these were some of the few occasions on which Lăzărescu worked with his wife, Ileana Lăzărescu (who was also an architect), on interior decoration. Lăzărescu and his wife Ileana On the opposite end of the spectrum from the Socialist realism that represented Soviet domination, the influence of American architects Richard Neutra and Mies Van der Rohe can be felt in a number of buildings Lăzărescu designed in Bucharest, such as in the \\"Lake 1\\" and \\"Lake 2\\" villas. Additional style elements of these buildings stem from the commissioned requirements, the environment of the buildings, the influence of Romanian monastic architecture, Nordic Classicism, and Swiss architecture. Several high-ranking Party officials commissioned Lăzărescu to build villas, and he fulfilled all of these requests enthusiastically except for one: the villa of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu, a request he turned down due to a feeling of aesthetic incompatibility with his patrons. Gheorghiu-Dej treated him as a family member. When other Party officials objected that Lăzărescu's responsibilities were incompatible with the fact that he was not a member of the Communist Party (something plainly illegal in his position at that time), he answered: \\"Let him do his work. If he wants to, he'll do politics later.\\" However, Lăzărescu never wanted to do politics. = 1965 – 1977 : Beginning of the Ceaușescu period and significant buildings = Felled by aggressive lung cancer, Gheorghiu-Dej died in the spring of 1965. At the time, Lăzărescu was traveling in France to place orders for building materials. He learned of the ascent to power of Nicolae Ceaușescu and, despite warnings from friends in France, returned to Bucharest. Arriving home, he was viewed as an enemy of the people for having wasted the country's money on luxury dwellings and was threatened with legal action. Like others who had been close to Gheorghiu-Dej, he was blacklisted by Ceaușescu, who had not yet digested Lăzărescu's refusal to build his villa. In 1968 he was asked to submit a proposal to a contest for the Otopeni International Airport, after Ceaușescu dismissed the initial submittals from the other competitors. Lăzărescu won the contest and builds the airport. Conference hall \\"Omnia\\", extension of the Communist Party headquarters Administrative and political headquarters in Pitești Following this, he built numerous other significant buildings in Romania, including (the Palace of Sports in Bucharest, the \\"Omnia\\" conference venue next to the Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest, a reception hall for the French embassy in Bucharest, and abroad, the Romanian embassy in Beijing and the Parliament building in Khartoum). He was appointed rector of the Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism in 1970 (for two consecutive terms) and a year later president of the Romanian Architects' Union. Parliament of Sudan in Khartoum The works he completed are significant, but his refusal was heard: other architects designed the private lodgings of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu. Lăzărescu kept an official tone in his relationship with the Ceaușescus. They respected his professionalism and he paid them the respect due patrons. = 1977 – 1982 : Restructuring of Bucharest by Ceaușescu and the National Theatre = The relationship with Ceaușescu started deteriorating after the 1977 Vrancea earthquake. Ceaușescu dug up some city restructuring plans that had been ordered by the king Carol II of Romania around 1940. He made them his own, and envisioned a restructuring program in the style of Haussmann, with a new downtown comprising housing, ministries, an opera, a museum, a hotel, and a Palace of the Parliament. Studies were drafted by several architectural teams. Ceaușescu asked Lăzărescu to build the new headquarters of the Romanian Communist Party and of the Romanian government, to match the function of the current buildings. Ceaușescu relentlessly, repeatedly asked for changes to the plans, and wanted to reduce the number of social and cultural buildings—in the end, only wanting the policial center, a ministry, and some housing. All the submissions to the contest stuck to these requirements, save for the one by the \\"youth team\\" led by the architect Anca Petrescu, who proposed a pyramid- shaped building reminiscent of the Mont Saint-Michel, without a clearly defined program. After Lăzărescu refused for a second time to create a similar proposal (he argued that he was unable to design a building just for the sake of its image, but without a program), he was removed from the contest. Lăzărescu was appointed to lead the remodelling of the National Theatre, a building that had been erected during the time of Gheorghiu-Dej (1964–1973) by the architects Horia Maicu, Romeo Belea and Nicolae Cucu. Lăzărescu's appointment to this project was a punishment for him having refused to overbid on the Palace of the Parliament, Ceaușescu being well-aware of the tensions he was causing between fellow architects.An article about the history of the National Theatre is available online (in Romanian). Towards the second half of the work, Lăzărescu was no longer invited to join Ceaușescu's visits to the building site, the latter's requests for changes being passed on by his counsellors. This was the period during which Ceaușescu's circle of counselors surrounded the presidential family, in order to distort information according to its interests, and eventually to suppress them entirely. = 1982 – 1986 : Construction of the National Library (unfinished) = The last project that Lăzărescu was appointed to was the construction of the National Library,Lăzărescu was replaced by the architect Anca Petrescu for the construction of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest. See the article on National Geographic (in Romanian), or the book Testimonies of the City by Richard Rodger and Johanna Herbert (editors) read online. a building that was left unfinished at the time he died on November 27, 1986, after lying in a coma for a month.

The painting depicts several workers on their break in the yard of a foundry and is one of the most popular of Anshutz' paintings. Painted near Wheeling, West Virginia, it is conceived in a naturalistic style featuring realistic anatomical depictions of men and boys similar to that of Thomas Eakins, although Eakins never painted industrial subjects.Griffin, 2004, p. 59. Also like Eakins, Anshutz composed this painting with the help of photographs and studies. Some of the figures are depicted in a classical pose, such as the man in the foreground rubbing his arm. This figure's pose imitates a pose from the Parthenon. The piece was exhibited at the Philadelphia Sketch Club in 1881 and compared to Eakin's work by art critics. Art historian Randall C. Griffin has written of it: \\"One of the first American paintings to depict the bleakness of factory life, The Ironworkers' Noontime appears to be a clear indictment of industrialization. Its brutal candor startled critics, who saw it as unexpectedly confrontational—a chilling industrial snapshot not the least picturesque or sublime.\\"Griffin, 2004, p. 61.

It is Matt Ross' first feature film. Premise A novelist and a corporate accountant conduct an affair over a period of several years, meeting only when they are each traveling for work in a city far from their homes. The film takes a minimalist approach: it consists entirely of scenes between the two of them in hotel rooms. Cast * Marin Ireland as woman * Chris Messina as man * Robert Deamer as bartender * Brett Collier as bar patron Production Matt Ross' original idea was to make an intimate film about a relationship that would primarily focus on characters rather than plot. He stated that \\"the genesis of this movie came out of conversations I had with Chris Messina\\". After two weeks of rehearsal, filming began in Los Angeles and continued for a week or two. During this time Marin Ireland was flying back and forth between Los Angeles and New York, where she was filming the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce. The film was edited during the next couple of months and it was determined that certain additional scenes were needed to help further define the relationship between the two characters. These last remaining scenes were shot in New York over the course of about another week. Filming took in total about 18 days. Before and during the shooting of the film, Ross encouraged the actors to collaborate in its development, resulting in more than 49 hours of material, some of it scripted and some improvised. During postproduction, many different complete versions of film were created, with scenes in different orders, different plots, and different beginnings or endings, before one version was selected as final. Critical reaction Variety found the film neither dramatically nor intellectually stimulating despite good chemistry between the lead actors. Slant gave it 1.5 out of 4 stars. The Village Voice felt that the characters weren't properly fleshed out, and that the film's stripped-down, minimalist approach prevented a sense of getting insight into their lives. The New York Times was also unimpressed, praising the quality of the acting but noting a lack of any dramatic tension drama or passion in the characters' relationships with each other. Rotten Tomatoes has given the film a score of 38%. Metacritic has given it a score of 50%.

He played college football at Colorado, and was drafted by the Packers in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Early years Bakhtiari was born in San Mateo, California. His older brother Eric Bakhtiari went on to play defensive end at the University of San Diego and for the Tennessee Titans. His father, Karl Bakhtiari, runs a real estate business in California. He is of Iranian and Icelandic descent. He attended Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, where he lettered two years in football and lacrosse, being named a team captain during his second year. The most memorable game of his high school career in football came against Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory, in which he held future USC Trojan Kevin Greene to no sacks and only allowed two tackles. In another game later in the season he had at least eight pancake blocks. He was named Honorable Mention All-West Catholic Athletic League, All-Metro (Bay Area), and All-San Mateo County as a senior when he helped lead his team to a 6–1 league record, winning the 2008 WCAL Co-Championship with Bellarmine College Preparatory, and made it to the CIF-CCS Open Division Semi-finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Bellarmine Bells. He was also listed in the Bay Area News Group as number eight out of 25 players from northern California on their 2008 Cream of the Crop team. Coming out of high school, Bakhtiari was six-feet-four-inches tall and weighed 266 pounds and was ranked only as a two-star prospect by Rivals.com. In a 2009 interview Bakhtiari commented: \\"People come up to me and go, 'Oh, you're only a two-star'. But I don't really care what my ranking is. All that matters is how you do when you put on the pads.\\" He received interest from several schools, receiving offers and visiting Colorado, Utah, UTEP, and Washington before signing his letter of intent with Colorado. College career Bakhtiari decided to play for the University of Colorado, and majored in Communications while playing for the Colorado Buffaloes football team from 2009 to 2012. He redshirted as a true freshman in 2009. During his first year on the field for the Buffaloes, he played in all twelve games, starting eleven. The one game he did not start was against Texas Tech, but he still was on the field for 24 snaps. He played the third-most snaps on the offense behind future New England Patriots and New York Giants offensive lineman Nate Solder and future Denver Broncos offensive lineman Ryan Miller with 796. Bakhtiari had 59 knockdown blocks which was fourth on the team, his highest number coming against Iowa State. He allowed one quarterback sack and seven pressures and was flagged for six penalties. During the game against Kansas that year he recovered an offensive fumble and returned it seven yards. For his efforts, he was named as an honorable mention for Freshman All-American honors by collegefootballnews.com. He was also a member of the All-Big 12-second-team for Academics. Bakhtiari began his redshirt sophomore campaign by suffering a severe injury to his knee in the season opener against Hawai’i on the seventh play of the game. He missed the next two games against California and LSU. Regardless, he still started the remaining games (11 total). He allowed two sacks on the year and was flagged once the entire season. At the end of the year, he was named as a member to the All- Pac-12-second team by the league's coaches and Phil Steele. Before his final season started, Bakhtiari was named to the preseason first-team All-Pac-12 squad. He started eleven games at left tackle, missing the game against Oregon with a knee sprain after attempting to play in the pre-game. He totaled 41 pancake blocks, and allowed 2.5 quarterback sacks and one pressure. His efforts gained him a spot on the watchlist for the Outland Trophy, and the Rotary Lombardi Award. Additionally, he earned second-team honors by the league coaches for the second year in a row. On January 8, 2013, Bakhtiari announced that he had opted to forgo his senior season at Colorado and declare for the 2013 NFL Draft. He added that his declaration for the draft had nothing to do with Colorado's 1–11 season the year before and subsequent firing of head coach Jon Embree. Mike Macintyre, the new head coach of Colorado, said that the team would have loved to have him but would fully support him in his endeavors. Professional career After declaring for the NFL Draft, Bakhtiari has stated he received a second or third round evaluation from NFL Draft Advisory Board. The Green Bay Packers selected Bakhtiari in the fourth round, (109th overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft. He was the ninth offensive tackle drafted and the first of two the Green Bay Packers drafted ahead of fourth round pick J. C. Tretter (122nd overall). During the Packers' 'Family Night' inter squad scrimmage later in training camp, starting left tackle Bryan Bulaga succumbed to a torn ACL injury. Due to the injury and Bakhtiari's play during training camp, he was inserted as the starting left tackle in the Packers first preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals at Lambeau Field. Though they lost, it was later noted that one of the positives to take away was the steady play of the rookies. He later went on to start every game at left tackle for the Packers, becoming the first rookie to do so in Green Bay since the start of the 16-game schedule employed by the NFL since 1978 and the only NFL rookie to start every game that season at left tackle in 2013. He was a key contributor to Green Bay finishing seventh in the league for rushing (blocking for rookie running back Eddie Lacy) and sixth in passing for the first time since 2004. Washington Redskins Following his rookie season, Bakhtiari worked significantly on his strength and continued to fight for his job at left tackle, prompting the Packers to move Bryan Bulaga to right tackle and have Bakhtiari at left. Later in the current Packers season, he was placed on the injury report for the game against the Miami Dolphins due to a back injury. He played in all 16 games of his sophomore season as well as the 2 playoff games. On September 13, 2016, the Green Bay Packers signed Bakhtiari to a four-year, $48 million contract extension that includes $16.7 million guaranteed and a $15 million signing bonus. Personal life Bakhtiari resides in Burlingame, California. While in high school, he created the Fund a Dream Scholarship, and also signed autographs at the Jerry Parins Cruise for Cancer in exchange for donations benefiting cancer research. He also visited homeless shelters and nursing homes while attending the University of Colorado. Bakhtiari introduced the Packers to the board game Settlers of Catan which soon became a team favorite. He was also responsible for a group of Packers players appearing in Pitch Perfect 2, when he reached out to director Elizabeth Banks on Twitter.

GAAR was originally proposed in the Direct Tax Code 2009 and was targeted at arrangements or transactions made specifically to avoid taxes. GAAR provisions were also present in the Direct Tax Code 2010 and Direct Tax Code 2013. However, the Direct Tax Code did not see the light of the day and was not implemented in India. GAAR was finally introduced in India by then Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee, on 16 March 2012 during the Budget session introduced vide Finance Act, 2012.

In India, the real discussions on GAAR came to light with the release of draft Direct Taxes Code Bill (popularly known as DTC 2009) on 12 August 2009. It contained the provisions for GAAR. Later on the revised Discussion Paper was released in June 2010, followed by tabling in the Parliament on 30 August 2010, a formal Bill to enact the law known as the DirectTaxes Code 2010. The same was to be made applicable wef 1 April 2012. However, owing to negative publicity and pressures from various groups, GAAR was postponed to at least 2013, and was likely to be introduced along with the Direct Tax Code (DTC) from 1 April 2013. Moreover, an Expert Committee has been set by Prime Minister (Manmohan Singh) in July 2012 to vet and rework the GAAR guidelines issued in June 2012. The latest reports (September 2012) indicates, it may not be implemented even for 3 years i.e. this will be postponed for 3 years (2016–17). Some of recent developments about GAAR are: *(a) 16 March 2012 : Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee takes a tough stand and announces that the government will crack down on tax avoidance effective from fiscal year 2012–13 *(b) 7 May 2012 : Finance Minister, Pranab Mukherjee forced to eat his words and agreed to defer GAAR by a year as his announcements spooked oversea investors *(c) 28 June 2012 : Finance Ministry releases first draft on GAAR; There is wide criticism of the provisions. *(d) 14 July 2012 : PM, Manmohan Singh, forms review committee under Parthasarathi Shome, for preparing a second draft by 31 August and final guidelines by 30 September 2012 *(e) 1 September 2012 : Shome Committee recommends to defer GAAR by three years. It also recommends some more investor friendly measures *(f) 14 January 2013 : GoI partially accepts the recommendations of Shome Committee and has decided to defer the same for 2 years and will now be effective from the year 2016–17 *(g) On 27 September 2013, GoI issued notification and as per this notification GAAR would be applicable to only to foreign institutional investors that have not taken the benefit of an agreement under Section 90 or Section 90A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 or Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). Thus now *(a) investments made by foreign investors prior to August 2010 will not attract GAAR; *(b) GAAR provisions that will come into effect from April 2017 and (c) apply only to business arrangements with a tax benefit exceeding Rs 30 million. On 20 January 2012, the Supreme Court of India gave the verdict in favour of Vodafone, saying that Vodafone did not owe any capital gain taxes. On 16 March, GAAR was presented to the Parliament by Pranab Mukherjee, who stated that its objective was to counter aggressive tax avoidance schemes. Summary The regulation allows tax officials to deny tax benefits, if a deal is found without any commercial purpose other than tax avoidance. It allows tax officials to target participatory notes. Under GAAR, the investor has to prove that the participatory note was not set to avoid taxes. It also allows officials to deny double taxation avoidance benefits, if deals made in tax havens were found to be avoiding taxes. Responses Adrian Mowat of JP Morgan in May 2012 said that there were ambiguities in the law and that it may discourage foreign investors. In May 2012, CLSA stopped issuing Indian participatory notes.

The painting depicts two small children dressed in white who are lighting paper lanterns as day turns to evening; they are in a garden strewn with pink roses, accents of yellow carnations and tall white lilies (possibly the Japanese mountain lily, Lilium auratum) behind them. The painting is dominated by green foliage, with no horizon or other horizontal line to give a sense of depth. The viewer seems to be on a level with the children but also looking down on them. The two subjects of the painting are the daughters of the illustrator Frederick Barnard – a friend of Sargent's. Dolly, left, was 11 years old and Polly, right, seven years old; they were chosen for their blonde hair, replacing Sargent's original model, Francis Davis Millet's five-year-old daughter, dark- haired Katherine. The title comes from the refrain of a popular song \\"Ye Shepherds Tell Me\\" by Joseph Mazzinghi, a pastoral glee for a trio of male voices, which mentions Flora wearing \\"A wreath around her head, around her head she wore, Carnation, lily, lily, rose\\". The work is set in an English garden at Farnham House in Broadway in the Cotswolds, where Sargent spent the summer of 1885 with Millet shortly after moving to England from Paris to escape the scandal caused by his 1884 painting Portrait of Madame X. The author Robert Louis Stevenson was also staying there while writing A Child's Garden of Verses and his verses inspired Sargent. Sargent also took inspiration from the lanterns that he saw hanging among trees and lilies while boating on the River Thames at Pangbourne with American artist Edwin Austin Abbey in September 1885. Sargent wanted to capture the exact level of light at dusk so he painted the picture en plein air – outdoors and in the Impressionist manner. Every day from September to November 1885, he painted in the few minutes when the light was perfect, giving the picture an overall purple tint of evening. The flowers in the garden died as summer turned to autumn, and they were replaced with artificial flowers. Sargent resumed painting the following summer at Millet's new home nearby in Broadway and finally finished the painting by the end of October 1886. In the course of working, Sargent cut down the rectangular canvas, removing approximately from the left side, to leave an approximately square shape. The work received a mixed reception at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1887, with some criticising his \\"Frenchified\\" style. However, there was also much praise, and Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, encouraged the Tate Gallery to buy the painting later that year, using money from the Chantrey Bequest. It was the first of Sargent's works to be acquired by a public museum. The painting remains part of the Tate collection and is displayed at Tate Britain.

Freese (February 19, 1903 – September 11, 1964) was the mayor of Norwalk, Connecticut.  Life and family  Freese attended a one-room school in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and was graduated from New Brunswick High School. He first came to Norwalk in 1928, while visiting his brother Arnold. He found work as the assistant credit manager at the Norwalk Tire and Rubber Company, as a Johnson & Johnson salesman, as a cost accountant at the American Hat Company, and at the Standard Safety Razor Corporation as a credit manager. He later started a photography business. In October 1933, he met Elizabeth Hutchinson, the niece of the newly elected mayor of nearby Bridgeport, Jasper McLevy at his victory party. They were married in June 1934. They had a son they named Jasper, after her uncle, in August 1936.  Political career  Freese was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor in 1939, 1941, 1943 and 1945. In those unsuccessful elections, he received between 400 and 600 votes apiece. Then he was a candidate for the Connecticut House of Representatives from Norwalk in 1946. In 1947, the citizens of Norwalk, taking notice of the sound and honest reputation of the socialist McLevy administration in Bridgeport, elected Socialist Freese as mayor with a total of 8,561 votes, the greatest plurality in the city's history. In the landslide, Socialist candidates won almost every other office in the municipal government. Freese was elected again as a Socialist in 1949. In 1951, he broke from the Socialist Party and defeated Republican candidate Stanley Stroffolino, despite Stroffolino's endorsement by the Republicans, the Democrats and the Socialists with whom Freese had just parted company. He was elected three times after forming the Independent Party of Norwalk in 1951, 1953 and 1957. At an annual $2,500 salary, he was Norwalk's first full-time mayor. He sold his business to be able to put in a full day's work at City Hall. No aspect of city government was too small to escape his attention. He often exercised his ex officio authority on city boards and commissions, which is granted to the mayor under the city charter, but had rarely been used. He was known to be seen on top of the Department of Public Works snowplows as they cleared the streets after a winter storm.

Over the past ten years he has created workout and fitness plans for top magazines across the United States. O magazine, [MSNBCMSNBC.com], Redbook, and Prevention magazine among others. Background Michael Gonzalez-Wallace has been involved with sports for more than 20 years. Michael's athletic career spans many years practicing semi-pro basketball in Spain, where his team, Estudiantes,:es:Club Baloncesto Estudiantes won the Spanish National Competition (similar to NCAA in USA; he was named the MVP of the Final, May 1993). In 1995, the Spanish basketball federation certified Michael as a strength trainer and basketball coach, giving him the opportunity to develop his teaching skills. Being involved with basketball for more than 15 years, Michael learned the important concepts of teamwork, leadership, muscle coordination, and physical strength training. A graduate of the Universidad Autonoma (a top economics school in Madrid, Spain), he added the art of doing research to his skill set. In 2002, he became a personal trainer for New York Sports Club where Fitness Manager Noah Gordon gave him an opportunity to teach his skills. Shortly after he received a certification from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. After two and a half years working in banking he quit banking in favor of new pursuits. Upon moving to USA he became immersed in Fitness and Human Performance. Michael's journey was recounted six years later by Forbes: “From Finance to Fitness” Books and DVDs In 2006 Michael launched The Brain Muscle Workout at a Central park event. The DVD debuted to positive reviews, including in the Chicago Tribune. A few years later, in 2007 he claims a coffee at Starbucks changed his life: “Sitting with some research papers in Starbucks Michael noticed a beautiful woman at the next table reading a neurology textbook. Michael started talking to her and she told him that she was a first year medical student at Columbia University showing him a book titled: “Neuroanatomy: Text and Atlas” by Neurobiologist John Martin PhD Medical Professor in Physiology and specialist in the brain and movement. She told Michael he was one of her professors, and suggested he contact him. Since then, neurobiologist John Martin PhD advises Michael on the development of a brain body fitness exercise program being part of his advisory board of Medical Professors. John Martin, PhD, a neuroscientist at Columbia University at that time, immediately recognized the brain benefits of Gonzalez-Wallace's workouts, and advised Gonzalez-Wallace to incorporate neuroscience into his workout. He found the exercises required no coordination patterns, by challenging posture and balancing limb movement. In 2009, Michael received an award for “Fitness Excellence\\" from Tim Pawlenty and Chris Coleman that recognized Super Body, Super Brain as a unique and innovative exercise program. In 2010 he published his first book with Harper One “Super Body, Super Brain” that reached the Best Selling List in Amazon after being featured in CBS The Early Show. School Program In October 2008 his program was introduced to the New York City Department of Education starting with an Elementary School in the Bronx, PS 277 Michael Gonzalez-Wallace designed the individualized fitness program with the supervision of Child Psychiatrist Dr Gregory Lombardo MD, PH.D. The school fitness program incorporates intense brain activity through movements requiring balance and coordination to improve concentration and attention while performing challenging exercises. The exercises are structured to advance gradually. In January 2009 WABC-TV featured the school fitness program in their local channel. Medical Community Since 2010 Super Body, Super Brain increased in popularity within the medical community to aid in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The road connects Rajaji Salai in the east with Wall Tax Road in the west. Passing through thickly populated residential areas of the historical neighbourhood, the road has several streets, lanes, and by lanes joining it housing several commercial establishments of the city. History An arial view of NSC Bose Road NSC Bose Road After Fort St. George was built in 1640, a new township for the servants of the inmates of the fort, known as the Black Town, came up outside the fort in the northern side. In 1746, the French captured the town of Madras and, following the Treaty of Aix- la-Chapelle, returned the town back to the English in 1749 in exchange for Quebec. Soon after this, the English flattened a part of the Black Town in order to have a clear field for fire in the event of an attack. In 1773, the English erected 13 pillars along the flattened area of the Black Town, banning all construction activities between the pillars and the fort as it might block the view of possible invaders. Soon a new Black Town was formed beyond these pillars, with the old Black Town giving way to the Madras High Court. A thoroughfare was formed along the stretch between the pillars and the high court, which eventually became known as China Bazaar Road. Of the 13 original pillars, only one survives today, which is being maintained in the compound of the Parry's building. Till the 19th century, the road was occupied by a large number of tiled houses. In 1787, Thomas Parry, a Welsh businessman, bought the land with a garden house lying across the High Court buildings at the junction of NSC Bose Road and Rajaji Salai and developed it as a commercial complex housing the offices of Parry and Lane. The junction eventually became known as Parry's Corner. In 1850, Pachaiyappa's Hall, another landmark on the road, was built and named after the philanthropist Pachaiyappa Mudaliar. The building remains today with the ground floor being occupied by several shops. The road was one of the major junctions in the city when tram transportation began in 1895. The road also housed the Kothawal Chavadi market to where vegetables from various places around the city were brought. The market was considered the largest in Asia. The intense business in the market resulted in wholesale vegetable vendors renting the shops in the market on an hourly basis. The market remained in the area till 1996, when it was shifted to Koyambedu. The road is also considered the origin of the jewellery market in the city. The road housed several gold and diamond merchants. The Madras Jewellers & Diamond Merchants' Association, which was established in 1938, was initially headquartered at China Bazaar Road. Later it was shifted to Car Street in Sowcarpet, but it again moved to its own premises on Badria Garden Lane, one of the several lanes of the road. The office of the Consulate General of the United States was located on this road from 1908 till the 1950s before moving to the current location at the Gemini Circle. Landmarks From the eastern side, the roads begins at the Parry's Corner and the eastern entrance of the Madras High Court, with the Beach railway station and Chennai Port lying further to the east marking the land's end. Famous landmarks of the road include Kuralagam, Broadway bus terminus, St. Mary's Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School, Kothawal Chavadi vegetable market, and flower market, in addition to several places of worship. The twin temples of Sri Chenna Mallikeshwarar and Sri Chennakesava Perumal are located on the road. Panoramic view of NSC Bose Road from the Madras High Court buildings The present-day road NSC Bose Road runs from Parry's Corner on the east to Wall Tax Road on the west for a length of 1.5 km. The width of the road ranges from 50 m near Parry's Corner to 10 m near Wall Tax Road junction. However, owing to congestion, less than one-third of the road remains motorable in many parts, chiefly between Wall Tax Road and Flower Bazaar. Despite the central business district of the city having moved gradually towards the south side, the road still remains an important commercial hub of the city. The thoroughfare is the second biggest bullion market in the country. For a long time, it remained the nerve centre of the city till the principal bus terminus was shifted to Koyambedu in 2002. Wholesale businesses based in this area includes drugs, cosmetics, hardware, stationery, and grocery. Every street radiating from the road is known for its own distinct business. For instance, Badrian Street located opposite the Flower Bazaar houses the city's retail flower trade. Although, the wholesale trade has been shifted to Koyambedu with the shifting of the Kothawal Chavadi market, there are still several shops on Badrian Street dealing with varieties of flowers. Devaraja Mudali Street, which lies closer to the Chenna Kesavaperumal temple, is famous for turmeric and kumkum powder meant for Hindu ritual purposes, with several shopkeepers having it as their family business. The tiled houses of the 18th and 19th centuries, many with a verandah on the top, have been gradually replaced with modern commercial complexes. However, there are few buildings that still remain on the western side of the NSC Bose Road and Govindappa Naicken Street. In January 2013, further to the public interest litigation petition filed in the court, the Corporation decided to improve the 1.5-acre Broadway bus terminus at an estimated cost of 33.6 million.

It is located near the Sabarimala Ayyappan temple, where the annual Makaravilakku event is conducted in the presence of nearly half a million pilgrims annually. Etymology Ponnambalamedu is derived from the Malayalam words Pon (gold), Ambalam (temple) and Medu (hill). The compound word is meant to refer to the hill of the golden temple. Location Ponnambalamedu is located at a distance of from the Sabarimala Ayyappan temple. The summit of the hill is at an altitude of from mean sea level. The hill is in the Goodrickal range of the Ranni Forest Division and has been included as a part of the Periyar National Park, a tiger reserve. Ponnambalamedu has been characterized as an ecologically sensitive area by forest officials in the region and has been identified as a critical habitat for tigers. The hill is also near the Kochupamba Power Substation, owned and operated by the Kerala State Electricity Board. The substation supplies electricity to the Sabarimala temple. Access to the peak of Ponnambalamedu is through an unpaved forest road controlled by local forest department authorities. History Historically, the summit of the hill was a place of worship for the local tribal population. The rituals of these tribes, most notably the lighting of Makaravilakku, were taken over by the Travancore Devasvom Board following higher number of pilgrims visiting Sabarimala. There are also reports stating that there was an Ayyappan temple at the summit of the hill which was maintained by local tribes. It was reported that these tribal people began the ritual of Makaravilakku by lighting large quantities of camphor and wood, and subsequently quenching the flame using a wet blanket three times at the time of the annual festival. After the takeover by the Devasvom Board, a platform for lighting the flame was constructed in the place of the temple. Today the annual festival is held at the Ayyappan temple in Sabarimala in the month of January. A holy flame is lit at Ponnambalamedu to commemorate the religious event. The event of Makaravilakku at Ponnambalamedu is witnessed by nearly half a million people each year. Makaravilakku Makaravilakku is the ritualistic lighting of a \\"holy flame\\" atop Ponnambalamedu during the annual festival at Sabarimala. This lighting of the flame at the summit of the hill marks the finale of the pilgrimage season at Sabarimala which lasts about two months. This flame is lit at the time of Deeparathana at the Sabarimala temple. The flame is lit using camphor at the summit. Makaravilakku, which was thought to be a miraculous event by most visiting pilgrims, was later proven to be a \\"make-believe\\" hoax, being lit by members of the Travancore Devasvom Board and local police, which eventually led to the deaths of many pilgrims in a stampede.

Life Little is recorded about Triachini's life other than documents about his work. Triachini was a member of a charitable foundation, to which the painter Prospero Fontana (father of Lavinia Fontana) also belonged, that provided poor relief to parishioners. The Via Bartolomeo Triachini, a road in Bologna, is named after him. Work Palazzo Malvezzi Triachini's work followed local tradition, and in some ways was similar to that Domenico Tibaldi (1541-1583). His buildings combined classical simplicity and grandeur in their lines, as exemplified by the facade of the Palazzo Sanguinetti. He was often mentioned in documents about San Michele in Bosco and the monastery of the Trinity, since destroyed. Triachini was responsible for the design of the Palazzo Lambertini, which was started around 1541 and completed in 1630. He created the court of the Palazzo Celesi, now part of the university. The design of the majestic and beautiful Palazzo Bentivoglio (1551) is attributed to Triachini. The Palazzo Nuovo, beside the complex of Rocca Isolani in the commune of Minerbio to the northeast of Bologna, was designed by Triachini with a faςade that features the motif of a loggia. This would become a common element of villas built in this period. Other works in Bologna that have been attributed to him include the Palazzo Poggi (1549), Palazzo Vizzani (1549-1562) and Palazzo Malvezzi de' Medici (1560). He was apparently given the commission for the Palazzo Poggi by the Bishop Giovanni Poggio shortly before he was elevated to Cardinal. However, other sources attribute the design of the Palazzo Poggi, which was built between 1549 and 1560, to Pellegrino Tibaldi. The Palazzo Malvezzi dates back to the 12th century. It was rebuilt after Triachini's design, with the work starting in 1560. The building is now the seat of the Provincial administration.

Azurmendi's essays cover modern European topics in great depth and knowledge. He has incorporated the philosophy and thinking of European thinkers, especially German ones. He often adopts a polemic tone.Altzibar, Xabier. \\"The Essay in Basque\\" in Mari Jose Olaziregi (ed.), Basque Literary History, Reno, Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada, pp. 283–84 Joxe Azurmendi is, in the opinion of many, one of the most prolific and erudite thinkers in the Basque Country.Altzibar, Xabier. \\"The Essay in Basque\\" in Mari Jose Olaziregi (ed.), Basque Literary History, Reno: Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada, 2012Iturriotz, Ander (2010). \\"Zergatik Azurmendi?\\", Hegats, 45: 9-15. Life Joxe Azurmendi studied philosophy and theology at The University of the Basque Country, Rome and Münster.Preface of Gandiaga in Joxe Azurmendi: Hitz berdeak, Oñati: EFA, 1971 At the beginning of the 1960s he joined the cultural movement which grew up around the magazine Jakin, and was in fact the director of the publication when it was prohibited for the first time by Franco's regime. He has collaborated closely and uninterruptedly with the magazine since its restoration. In that publication he has raised the problems of Basque society in the context of European thinkers.Sudupe, Pako: 50eko hamarkadako euskal literatura II, Donostia: Utriusque Vasconiae, 2011. p. 283. During the early 1970s he focused his attention on disseminating basic literature in the Basque language on subjects which were being hotly debated at the time in the Basque Country: nationhood, socialism, internationalism,Joxe Azurmendi: Arana Goiri- ren pentsamendu politikoa, Donostia: Hordago Lur, 1979. p. 1. etc. In the 1980s he began teaching at The University of the Basque Country, and in 1984 he submitted his thesis on Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, the founder of the Mondragon cooperative movement, in which he argued that Arizmendiarrieta's project aimed to unite individuals and society under an organisation which combined both socialism and French personalism.Andoni Olariaga: \\"Joxe Azurmendi. Askatasunaren pentsalaria\\" in Alaitz Aizpuru, Euskal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida, Bilbo: UEU, 2012. p. 149 In 1992 he published what was to become his best-known work: Espainolak eta euskaldunak (The Spanish and the Basques). The work, published by Elkar, was written in response to a text by Sánchez-Albornoz which claimed that \\"The Basques are the last people to be civilised in Spain; they have a thousand years less civilisation than any other people ... They are rough, simple people who nevertheless consider themselves to be the children of God and the heirs to his glory. But they are really nothing more than un-Romanised Spaniards.\\"Joxe Azurmendi: Espainolak eta euskaldunak, Donostia: Elkar, 1992. p. 17. Azurmendi's essay refuted and dismantled the stereotypes maintained about the Basques by certain Spanish intellectuals. It was on the threshold of the new millennium, however, that Azurmendi's work reached its height. During the early years of the 21st century he published the trilogy formed by Espainiaren arimaz (About the soul of Spain) (2006, Elkar), Humboldt. Hizkuntza eta pentsamendua (Humboldt. Language and Thought) (2007, UEU) and Volksgeist. Herri gogoa (Volksgeist. National Character) (2008, Elkar). In this trilogy, Joxe Azurmendi reveals some of his most significant thinking. Philosophical work His work emerged and developed during a period marked by a crisis of culture, politics and values. But it was a crisis that he understood not as something negative, but rather something that opened up a whole new range of possibilities. Consequently, all his thinking is centred around the defence of freedom in every field, but especially in relation to conscience and thinking. Far from fleeing the crisis, then, his work tries to outline how we can live in this situation. To this end, he adopts a relativist perspective, and given that modernity has left us with no solid base, he fights against the last vestiges of the dogmatism towards which our society tends to lean when in crisis: In this sense, for example, he is critical of the modern state, which he accuses of being the new church seeking to control our consciences.Joxe Azurmendi: Barkamena, kondena, tortura, Donostia: Elkar, 2012, section: \\"Kondena, barkamendua, hoben kolektiboa\\". He also criticises the exploitation of morality, or in other words, how politicians, instead of solving the problems facing them in their various areas or fields, flee instead to moral ground in order to hide their responsibilities under the cloak of supposedly absolute moral principles: He has also made an important contribution in questioning the canonical interpretations which have been constructed regarding different issues. Of particular interest, due to his erudition and training in Germany, is his interpretation of the German Enlightenment. In this context he deconstructs the apparent opposition between the French Enlightenment and German Romanticism and proposes a new way of thinking about the different aspects which stem from this opposition.Joxe Azurmendi: Volksgeist. Herri gogoa, Donostia: Elkar, 2008. p. 129. In this way, he defies certain Spanish and French intellectuals (Alain FinkielkrautJoxe Azurmendi: Euskal Herria krisian, Donostia: Elkar, 1999. p.119) and argues that nationalism in fact arose in France (Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Ernest Renan) and was later reinterpreted by the German thinkers and romantics. By doing this, he questions the way in which authors such as Goethe, Schiller, Herder or Humboldt are viewed as the fathers of metaphysical nationalism. In this field, the opposition between civic nationalism and ethnic nationalism is deconstructed.Joxe Azurmendi: Historia, arraza, nazioa, Donostia: Elkar, 2014. p. 27. Thus, Azurmendi criticizes the essentialist basis of Spanish nationalismJoxe Azurmendi: Espainiaren arimaz, Donostia: Elkar, 2006 and French nationalismJoxe Azurmendi: Historia, arraza, nazioa, Donostia: Elkar, 2014 that operates under these nation states. Some of the topics Azurmendi deeply develops in his essays first appeared in his poetry of youth. Azurmendi is within the Basque poetry of the 60s which shows the fight against the tradition, the old faith and the dogmatic certainties:Estankona, I. 2010: \\"Artean gazte eta berde: Azurmendiren Hitz berdeak eta Manifestu atzeratua\\", Hegats, 45: 71-83 But we wish to be free is that my fault? They tried to give us a tree from Gernika, a false blank check, as if the desire to be free were a sin, but despite that, we, quite simply, wish to be free. That is what we want, that is all. This is the latest deception: they have led us to believe before from outside and now from within that it is our responsibility to justify our wish to be free. Manifestu atzeratua (Belated Manifesto) (1968) He also dedicates a large part of his work to recovering and reinterpreting Basque thinkers, breaking through and dismantling numerous stereotypes. Of particular interest is his research into Jon Mirande, Orixe, UnamunoJoxe Azurmendi: \\"Unamunoren atarian\\" in Euskal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida, Bilbo: UEU, 2012. p. 29.Joxe Azurmendi: Bakea Gudan. Unamuno, historia eta karlismoa, Tafalla: Txalaparta, 2012. Azurmendi delves into the thinking of Unamuno, under the pretext of the novel Paz en la guerra by Unamuno, which deals with the last Carlist War and especially with the site of Bilbo. It therefore turned out in an interpretive essay on the conflict Carlism vs. liberalism, or in other words, in an interpretive essay on Basque Country and Modernity. According to Azurmendi Unamuno analyzed and rejected the Basque problem from a 19th-century point of viewInterview on Unamuno: «Unamuno ez da inoiz liberala izan; antiliberala zen azken fasean ere», Berria, 31 May 2012 (Retrieved 29 October 2013) and others. He is an author who has worked from within and for Basque culture. He claims to have been influenced by Basque authorsJoxe Azurmendi: \\"Kierkegaard-en 'egunkari ezkutua'\\", in J.L. Ormaetxea, Txillardegi lagun giroan, Bilbo: UEU, 2000 from the post-war period, for example, in questions of language. In this field, he has researched other authors also, including Heidegger, Wittgenstein, George Steiner and Humboldt. The fact that his vast oeuvre is all written in the Basque language is clearly consistent with his thinking. Writing style In his language Joxe Azurmendi combines an educated register with colloquial expressions, and his prose is fast, incisive, and ironic. Azurmendi's Basque is modern and standard and he demonstrates great knowledge of the language, and richness and variety of expression.Altzibar, Xabier 2012. \\"The Essay in Basque\\", in Mari Jose Olaziregi, Basque Literary History, Reno: Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada. p. 284 Awards and recognition * 1976: Andima Ibiñagabeitia Award for the work: Espainolak eta euskaldunakAnaitasuna, 328. * 1978: Irun Hiria Award for the work: Mirande eta kristautasuna (Mirande and Christianity). * 1998: Irun Hiria Award for the work: Teknikaren meditazioa (Meditations on Technique). * 2005: Juan San Martin Award for the work: Humboldt: Hizkuntza eta pentsamendua (Humboldt.

During World War II, these maps were used by many American, British, and allied servicemen to escape from behind enemy lines. \\"The Allies needed to be able to print their clandestine maps on a material that would be hardier than paper – material that wouldn't tear or dissolve in water\\"Garber, Megan. 2013. \\"How Monopoly Games Helped Allied POWs Escape During World War II.\\" The Atlantic.

The sections of map were sewn into the clothing. Item Held by the Australian War Memorial. Some American intelligence offices visited the UK in 1942 to be briefed on the British efforts in \\"escape and evasion\\" techniques and equipment. The British MI9 gave the Americans a book or manual, called, \\"Per Ardua Libertas\\", to take back to the US. Published in this manual were examples of each cloth escape and tissue escape map that the British had produced. \\"After this meeting with the British, the United States began to produce its own escape maps.\\" Most of the American maps supplied by the Army Map Service from World War II were actually printed on rayon acetate materials, and not silk.US Cloth Maps of World War II.\\" 2007. However, because of the silky texture of the materials, they were referred to by the more familiar textile name. \\"During WWII hundreds of thousands of maps were produced by the British on thin cloth and tissue paper. The idea was that a serviceman captured or shot down behind enemy lines should have a map to help him find his way to safety if he escaped or, better still, evade capture in the first place.\\"Hall, Debbie. \\"Wall tiles and Free Parking: escape and evasion maps of World War II.\\" Many of these maps were also used in clandestine wartime activities. The cloth maps were sometimes hidden in special editions of the Monopoly board game sets sent to the prisoners of war camps. The marked game sets also included foreign currency (French and German, for example), compasses and other items needed for escaping Allied prisoners of war. Escape maps were also printed on playing cards distributed to Prisoners of War which could be soaked and peeled apart revealing the escape map.BMPokerWorld. February 12, 2013. Other maps were hidden inside spools of cotton thread in sewing kits. \\"Due to the inherent strength and extremely compact nature of the MI9 mulberry leaf tissue maps, they could be wound into twine and then rolled into the core of cotton reels...\\"Froom, Phil.

Oflag IV-C, more commonly known as Colditz Castle Many of the maps of the Pacific region were printed by the US Army Map Service, while the UK was responsible for many of the European Theatre maps. Many of the US Navy charts were folded in envelopes and distributed to the air crews before a mission, and to be turned in when the mission was successfully completed. They were called \\"drift charts\\" by the Navy, \\"...since their prime purpose was to indicate to aircrews survivors in their life rafts in which direction the ocean currents and prevailing winds would cause their rafts to drift...\\".Doll, John G. 2002. Cloth maps, charts and blood chits of World War II. Page 22. The maps were quite effective. Some 35,000 Allied troops in all escaped from enemy territory during WW-II, and it is estimated that almost half of them used variations on these maps to help in their escape or evasion of capture. Post WW-II to Modern Evasion Charts New US evasion charts were also printed for the US Air Force after the war on synthetic fabric from 1947 to 1951. There are nineteen sheets printed in this series. Each sheet has a graphic in the lower right-hand corner showing where the sheet lies. Each sheet is identified by a \\"CL\\" followed by a two to three digit number. Map coverage in this series starts at the North pole and covers down to the equator. The 19th sheet is at 1:500,000 scale and covers both North and South Korea. The post WW-II charts were superseded by evasion charts printed on vinyl plastic sheet and included multiple declination corrected compass roses and a star chart for finding Polaris for navigation at night.D.O.D Evasion Chart, EVC 500-2 (SEA), 2nd edition, March 1968 These were issued during the American conflict with Vietnam, but the print was subject to wear and the plastic was prone to stress cracking at folds and corners when carried on flying days for several months as USAF Captain Roger Locher noted when using one during his record 23-day evasion and rescue near Hanoi after his F-4 Phantom fighter jet was shot down. He also suggested a more detailed 1:50,000 map would have been more useful to him as a combat evader on the ground than the 1:250:000 evasion chart, Locher recommended two evasion charts could be overlapped to protect a downed airman from rain if worn \\"like an armidillo\\".http://www.f4phantom.com/drupal/references Roger Locher audio talk tapes on his rescue pt-1 Locher's evasion experience, the longest for an uncaptured American pilot since WW-II deep in enemy territory, would guide USAF survival training and future design of evasion charts. Current USAF evasion charts, introduced immediately before Operation Desert Storm, and also issued to many allied air forces, are printed on spunbond olefin fiber polymer sheet and are waterproof and extremely strong. They include survival navigation instructions using the US lensatic compass and basic celestial orientation for use when lacking a compass or GPS, use of the survival radio, edible and dangerous plants, fish, and animals found in the map area, sea current flow rates, first aid instructions, and other localized survival tips. The maps are camouflage patterned and can be used as a blanket, sun cover, splint, food or water carrier, and wound cover in addition to assisting in navigation, they are large enough to even use as a sleeping wrap.http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/5266109 USAF Captain Scott O'Grady, brought down by hostile fire over Bosnia in 1996, later wrote “When I was finally settled in, I pulled my evasion chart from my G-suit pocket and began to plot the longitude and latitude coordinates I’d gotten from my GPS receiver last night… [It] showed all the hills valleys, rivers, and land features around me. On the legend was other helpful information about local vegetation and animals”. Captain O'Grady found the chart so large that he cut out his evasion area to make it more usable.http://www.kmimediagroup.com/gif/articles/424-articles-gif/evasion- charts-aid-safe-returns  References  Bibliography  * Australia. 1944.

It had a top speed of , and could lift up to  Variants Mk1 and Mk2  In 1962, a differential lock, an hour meter and a padded seat were all added. During the same year, a second model (MK2) was released, featuring a more advanced hydraulic system. This allowed position control, based on the top link draft control, as well as mixing control. The Mk2 also saw some cost-cutting measures, such as the Bosch fuel injection being replaced by a lower performance Simms unit, as well as Lucas electrics replacing the Bosch. The 310D engine was replaced by a cheaper 310A unit. The most prominent exterior differences between the MK1 and MK2 are a spraying device, and a lifting device connected to the hand lever. Replacement In 1965, a replacement was introduced in the form of the Valmet 565.

It is reputed to have aphrodisiac properties. Description The species is a tree which grows up to tall. Young branches are hairy but they become hairless as the tree ages. The leaves, which are long and wide, are smooth and shiny on their upper surfaces. The lower surface of the leaves is hairy with prominently raised veins. The stipules are broad at the base but narrowing to a point; they are about long. The flowers are hermaphroditic with five white petals, seven stamens and seven or eight staminodes. The fruit is a fleshy drupe, long and wide. Taxonomy The species was described by Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet is 1775, together with P. montana. In his 1972 monograph, Ghillean Prance designated P. campestris as the type species of the genus due to the fact that Aublet's illustration of P. montana contains errors and includes parts of plants belonging to two different species of Parinari. In 1789 Antoine Laurent de Jussieu latinised Aublet's name for the genus to Parinarium; although incorrect by current rules of taxonomy, Jussieu's version of the name was widely used over the next two centuries. Distribution Parinari campestris grows in open forests, nears the edges of savannas, and along river banks. It ranges from Trinidad in the north, through parts of Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana into northern Brazil. Uses Parinari campestris is one of several species including Richeria grandis and Roupala montana which known by the common name bois bandé. These species are reputed to have aphrodisiac properties. The species is also used ritually in winti, an Afro-Surinamese religion. Extracts from P. campestris leaves have been shown to inhibit the interaction between Vascular endothelial growth factor A and Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1.

The bridge was originally completed in 1925 and carried U.S. Route 16 (US 16) over the Missouri River. In 1953, Lake Francis Case was created by the new Fort Randall Dam and the bridge became obsolete. The Wheeler Bridge, also completed in 1925, was floated up the river and the two bridges were joined to span the new lake. The bridge now carries Interstate 90 Business (I-90 Bus.). The main path of I-90 crosses the lake on a modern bridge south of the Chamberlain Bridge and a railroad bridge crosses about south of I-90. Chamberlain Bridge is designated South Dakota Department of Transportation bridge no. 08-068-084 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. 1925 bridge In 1923 South Dakota's bridge fund had a balance of $4 and groups from Rosebud, Chamberlain, Pierre, Forest City and Mobridge asked the state legislature to fund a bridge in their location to cross the Missouri River. State bridge engineer John Edward Kirkham promised that he could build all five bridges for $2 million, even though a single bridge at Bismarck, North Dakota across the Missouri had recently cost $1.3 million. Kirkham later fulfilled his promise, building all five bridges for a total of $2.1 million., see especially page E36. Pre-1953 postcard of the original bridge The original Chamberlain Bridge was composed of four 336-foot riveted Pennsylvania through truss spans laid end to end. It was built by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Works of Leavenworth, Kansas and completed in September 1925 at an estimated cost of $303,623. The Wheeler Bridge, originally known as the Rosebud Bridge, was composed of six 256-foot pin-connected Pennsylvania through truss spans. It was built by the Kansas City Bridge Company with steel provided by the American Bridge Co. and also completed in September 1925. Its estimated cost was $771,080. This bridge with its pin-connections, was designed to be disassembled because Kirkham thought that it might be replaced with a combined railroad-highway bridge. 1953 bridge As the waters of Lake Francis Case began to rise in 1953, sections of the Wheeler Bridge were floated northward to construct the new Chamberlain Bridge. The new bridge site was slightly south of the old bridge site and the bridge was in effect widened by using two parallel bridge spans to replace one span on the old bridge. The four spans of the old Chamberlain bridge formed the easternmost two double-spans of the new bridge. The six smaller spans from the Wheeler Bridge formed the westernmost three double-spans of the new bridge. The cost of construction was $4.5 million and the new bridge was dedicated on December 7, 1953.

History Formed in September 1915, it established branches across much of South Africa (excluding the Western Cape). While early attempts to recruit white workers failed, the ISL soon came to the attention of the young African National Congress, (then called the \\"South African Native National Congress\\") and several prominent early ANC members attended ISL meetings. By September 1917 the ISL had helped to form the first black African trade union in the country, the Industrial Workers of Africa. While its founders were mainly drawn from the radical wing of the white working class, the movement would develop a substantial black African, Coloured and Indian membership. David Ivon Jones was a founder and influential member of the ISL Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the ISL became enthusiastic supporters of the Bolsheviks. Ivon Jones, co-founder of the ISL and editor of the league's organ The International welcomed the revolution with an article titled \\"Dawn of the World.\\" The article calls the revolution \\"an unfolding of the world-wide Commonwealth of Labour, which if the oppressed of all lands only knew...would sweep them into transports of gladness.\\" David Simelane. “The International Socialist League”, published by Umkhonto we Sizwe (1981) https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/the-international-socialist-league This enthusiasm for the Bolsheviks would ultimately lead the ISL to merge with several other socialist organizations to form the Communist Party of South Africa in 1921. Hirson, Baruch. A History of the Left in South Africa: Writings of Baruch Hirson. London: I.B. Tauris, 2005. Page 45-47. Merge into the SACP and Legacy  The ISL became defunct following its merge into the Communist Party of South Africa in 1921 but, provided many notable early figures to the Communist Party. The centrality of the ISL in the formation of the SACP left a political mark on the party for years to come, and was responsible for a strong syndicalist influence on the early politics of the SACP.Lerumo, A. Fifty Fighting Years: The Communist Party of South Africa, 1921-1971. London: Inkululeko, 1987. When the Industrial Workers of Africa merged into the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, or ICU, in 1920, it too spread the ISL's syndicalist ideas within that union.

History The Edgecombe County Public Schools system developed from the merger of the old Edgecombe County Schools and Tarboro City Schools. At the same time, a merger push was happening in neighboring Nash County. The movements in both counties had been going on for years, motivated in part by declining enrollments in Rocky Mounty City Schools, but disagreements focused on district borders. Since the town of Rocky Mount exists in both counties, there was some delay in the merger finalization as court battles over district boundaries and other issues dominated discussions. The original push for merger started in the late 1970s. The state legislature approved the merger in 1991, but this was not finalized until 1993. In 2003, the system officially changed its name from Edgecombe County Schools to Edgecombe County Public Schools.

Yanagihara Naruko (Japanese: 柳原愛子), also known as Sawarabi no Tsubone (26 June 1859 – 16 October 1943), was a Japanese lady-in- waiting of the Imperial House of Japan. A concubine of Emperor Meiji, she was the mother of Emperor Taishō and the last concubine to have given birth to a reigning Japanese emperor. Life Yanagihara Naruko was born in Kyoto as the second daughter of imperial chamberlain Yanagihara Mitsunaru (1818–1885), who held the rank of chūnagon in the imperial household and was subsequently appointed dainagon. The Yanagihara family were of the Reizei family line of the Fujiwara clan. Her elder brother, CountThe Directory & Chronicle for China, Japan, Corea, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, Malay States, Sian, Netherlands India, Borneo, the Philippines., Hongkong Daily Press Office, 1888, p. 322. Yanagihara Sakimitsu (4 May 1850 – 2 September 1894), fought in the Boshin War on the imperial side, subsequently becoming Lieutenant Governor of the Tōkaidō and later Governor of Yamanashi Prefecture. Entering the diplomatic service after the Restoration, he signed the Sino-Japanese Friendship treaty after the First Sino-Japanese War, was ennobled as a count and became a privy councillor, helping to draft the Imperial House Law before his death at the age of 44. During her lifetime, Lady Naruko was described as an intelligent, graceful and gentle lady, admired by all in the harem. She was noted as an excellent poet and calligrapher. She joined the imperial household in 1870 as a lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Empress Eishō, and was appointed gon no tenji (lady of the bedchamber) on 20 February 1873. Lady Naruko and the Meiji Emperor were both descended from the Ōgimachisanjō clan; both shared a great-great-grandfather in Ōgimachisanjō Sanetomo (1748–1785), a senior palace courtier, making them third cousins. On 21 January 1875, she gave birth to her first child, Shigeko, Princess Ume, at the Aoyama Palace, but the princess died of meningitis the following year, on 8 June 1876. On 23 September 1877, she gave birth to Yukihito, Prince Take, who also died of meningitis before his first birthday, on 26 July 1878. On 31 August 1879, she gave birth to her third child and the only one to survive into adulthood, the future Emperor Taishō. The prolonged and extremely difficult birth resulted in Lady Naruko becoming hysterical, crying and screaming through the delivery. On 6 September, the emperor named his son Yoshihito, later giving him the title of Prince Haru. Owing to the difficult delivery, Lady Naruko did not recover her health for some time; as her son had contracted meningitis shortly after his birth, his life was feared for until he finally recovered in late December. As a result of her delicate health following her son's birth, she never again served the emperor as a lady of the bedchamber. In 1902, she was officially appointed as an imperial lady-in-waiting. In her later years, she was conferred several prestigious honours in recognition of having continued the imperial line, despite a tendency to blame her for her son's increasingly poor mental health. However, she was permitted to be present at her son's deathbed in December 1926. In 1941, Lady Naruko's great-grandniece, the Hon. Takagi Yuriko, married her grandson Prince Mikasa. Lady Naruko died on 16 October 1943, aged 84, in the reign of her grandson the Showa Emperor, having outlived her son the previous emperor by nearly two decades. She was buried in Nakameguro Yūtenji (5-chome, Meguro-ku) in Tokyo.

The hotel has been a grade II listed building since 26 February 1998. Location The hotel is in the North Quay area of Great Yarmouth and is close to the town centre. Great Yarmouth railway station is south east of the hotel. The nearest Airport is in Norwich Airport and is west of the hotel.County A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, page 228 The Market Gates Bus Station in Great Yarmouth is from the hotel and is in easy walking distance. Great Yarmouth sea front is east of the hotel. History The building the Hotel occupies today dates from the 17th century and is amalgamation of two flint faced buildings which had been originally built by wealthy merchants, of which, at the time, there were many in this sea port town. During the 1600s there were many merchants in Yarmouth, many of whom had arrived in the town from Holland. They had arrived following the devastation that the Black Death had reaped on the town, killing upwards of 7000 townsfolk. These merchants had become prosperous, dealing in fish, grain and wool exports. Many merchants built fine brick and stone town houses along the quay side. Very few examples of these houses survive in the town today, but of those that are left, the present Star Hotel is one. This original merchant's house was built by William Crowe. He was a very wealthy man, and was twice the bailiff of Yarmouth. His house was on one of the prime residential areas of the town, close to the bridge across the River Yare which marked the main road into town. By the 18th century the house had become the property of Thomas Dawson. The house then passed over to the ownership of Robert Wilson who was a corn merchant. Following his death, the house was passed into the ownership of the Bradshaw family. In the latter part of the 18th century the property was converted from a house to the Star Tavern by the Bradshaw family. The Bradshaws also converted a malt house connected to the property into stables and a coach house, a necessary facility of any tavern of that period. Over the next hundred years the Star had several different owners. In 1822 the landlord was Mr William Woolverton. During his tenure he made several improvements to the tavern, adding a billiard room and dining room to replace the stable block. = Charles Dickens = In 1848 Charles Dickens visited and stayed in Great Yarmouth while gathering material for his book David Copperfield and many of the town's buildings have their place in the book including the Star, which becomes the Inn where David and Steerforth stayed. = The Royal Mail = In 1819, the Star Tavern was the Yarmouth terminus for the royal mail coach, which left for London every day at 2:00 pm. By 1845, the tavern was also the terminus for mail for Birmingham, and a coach left for Leicester at 4:40 pm. = Demolition and re-location = In the 1920s the Star Tavern was owned and run by the Bayfield family. It was now known as the Star Hotel. In October 1930 The Star Hotel was put up for sale by the Bayfields. The building was sold for £1850.00 to the Postmaster General, to be demolished to make way for an extension to the telephone exchange which occupied the adjacent building to the South. Part of the buildings interior was sold by auction before the demolition of the building. The panelling and ceiling of one of the rooms, which was known as the Nelson room, were bought and removed and shipped to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York where they may be seen to this day. = Lord Horatio Nelson = Admiral Horatio Nelson often stayed in the Star HotelYarmouth is an antient Town: Author, A.A.C. Hedges:Published By, Blackall Books: Revised edition, 2001: Page 56 People and Places: and the room that he always had reserved for him became known as the Nelson room. It is the elaborately fixtures and fittings of this room which are now an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. = Re-location = Following the demolition of this first hotel the Bayfields purchased the building next door. This building, called Stone House had also been built by a wealth merchant by the name of Anthony Ellys in 1764 on the site of a much older house. The Star Hotel's license was transferred to the new premise thus continuing the name. This new property also had many outstanding features such as rooms with fitted panels similar to the already described room's interior sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Since 1881 Stone House had also been a hotel and was called the Cromwell Temperance Hotel. At the time of its sale in 1930 it had been owned by Mr Frank Woolsey. In 1946 further expansion to the hotel took place. Some cottages which stood to the rear of the hotel were acquired and became part of the hotel complex. The business, now called The Star Hotel Great Yarmouth (1930) Ltd was renamed the New Star Hotel. In 1946 the ownership changed hands again and now became part of Norfolk and Suffolk Hotels Ltd. In 1949 the cottages at the rear were demolished and the hotel was extended and improved. Once again the hotel was sold to Truman Hanbury Buxton and Co Ltd. In 2001 the hotel was taken over by Queens Moat Hotels Ltd and was refurbished and became part of the Elizabeth Hotel group. Unfortunately in 2009 the Elizabeth Hotel group went into administration. This led to the hotel being taken over by Brazile Ltd. Since 2010 the Hotel has been owned by Geraldine Thornton.

Life  Hyde was born in the United Kingdom at Kingston upon Thames (near London), but immigrated to Canada with his parents in 1926. Settling in Toronto, Hyde was drawn to the arts by exhibits at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the Art Gallery of Ontario) and especially seeing Lawren Harris' North Shore, Lake Superior. \\"That was the first one that made a great impression on me and it's then that I became really serious about art.\\" He began attending night classes at Toronto's Central Technical High School where his teachers included Carl Schaefer and Charles Goldhamer. In the early 1930s, Hyde took up wood engraving, and other forms of block engraving, his work often appearing as illustrations or cover art for left-wing publications, such as New Advance and New Frontier. In 1942, Hyde moved to Ottawa, joining the National Film Board of Canada under John Grierson and worked at the NFB until his retirement in 1972. Hyde was married in 1939 to Bettye Marguerite Bambridge, and had two sons, Anthony (1946– ) and Christopher (1949– ), both novelists.  Work = Film = Hyde's film- making at the NFB fell into two periods. Beginning in 1945, he directed a number of films in typical NFB documentary style, including Fur Trade (1946, produced by Harry Campbell), Bronco Busters (1946, about the Calgary Stampede) and Art for Everybody (1948, produced by Sydney Newman, part of the Canada Carries On series). During the McCarthyite period, people identified as having left-wing political affiliations were not permitted to hold positions normally given film credits, thereby compelling many film-makers to leave the Board, and forcing Hyde out of film production into the Board's promotion department, where he spent the next seventeen years. He returned to film-making in 1967 with the first of the Tuktu series, which eventually included thirteen documentary films for children based around the life of an Inuit boy and his family. These films were very successful, distributed worldwide, and were recognised at the 21st Venice Biennale. Hyde also made more conventional documentaries, such as Tugboat (1968), Family House (1970, based on an essay by the architect Humphrey Carver) and City Limits (1971, an exploration of the North American city through the eyes of Jane Jacobs.) = Philatelic = Hyde was introduced to the possibilities of postage stamp design by Emanuel Hahn, who designed several Canadian coins and stamps, and whom Hyde met while making the NFB documentary, Third Dimension (1947), a survey of Canadian sculpture. He was also interested in the techniques of steel engraving (still in use for stamps at that time), and wrote about them in Canadian Art. Between 1954 and 1957 he produced eight stamps for the Post Office of Canada: 1954, a 15¢ airmail stamp depicting a gannet in flight; 1955, a 5¢ stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of Alberta and Saskatchewan joining the Canadian Confederation; 1955, a 5¢ stamp honouring the 8th World Scout Jamboree, at Niagara-on-the-Lake, the first held outside Europe; 1957, a series of 5¢ stamps, illustrating Canadian recreational activities—fishing; swimming; hunting; skiing; and in 1957 a 5¢ stamp of the common loon, described by a reviewer as possessing \\"the rare combination of delicate treatment and rugged clarity that is appropriate to a stamp size picture\\". = Books and book illustrations = Hyde wrote and illustrated a children's book, Brave Davy Coon, and published (but did not illustrate) two juvenile novels, Under the Pirate Flag and Captain Deadlock. He contributed illustrations and decorations to many books, such as A Pocketful of Canada and early editions of the poetry of Jay Macpherson (O Earth Return, 1954, Toronto), Daryl Hine (Five Poems, 1954, Toronto), and Dorothy Livesay (New Poems, 1954, Toronto). He provided nine major wood engravings for William E. Greening's The Ottawa and many smaller engravings for Canada's First Bank: A History of the Bank of Montreal, by Merril Dennison. = Wood engravings and Southern Cross = Although Hyde worked in many media—he also produced easel paintings throughout his career—he is best known for his wood engravings. Wood engravings are distinguished from woodcuts by being engraved on blocks composed of end grain pieces of hard, fine-grained woods, such as boxwood or pear later, thus enabling complex images with very fine lines to be produced. Hyde became interested in this technique while at Central Tech, and made his first engravings under the influence of British artists such at Paul Nash and Eric Gill, and the American, Rockwell Kent. In 1934 Hyde produced, Discovery, a series of engravings (at least fifty-one) telling the story of the Viking discovery of America, and in 1937 a portfolio of illustrations for Macbeth (Golden Dog Press, Toronto). His most important work in the media was created between 1948 and 1951, Southern Cross, \\"A Novel of the South Seas, Told in Wood Engravings\\". Using 118 wood engravings, Hyde tells a story based around the tests of the hydrogen bomb made by the United States at the Bikini Atoll in 1946. The inspiration of book was clearly political, and the book has been called \\"a political marker of the Cold War years\\". It is—as Rockwell Kent says in his introduction the book—the work of \\"a master of the difficult and infinitely laborious art of wood engraving\\".

Walker in company with works by Frans Masereel, Lynd Ward, and Giacomo Patri, so that the work can be seen in historical context. The novel, with a large selection of illustrations, is carefully considered in a major critical work, Wordless Books: The Original Graphic Novels, by wordless novel historian David A. Beronä. In a review of Graphic Witness, Lance Eaton states, \\"Hyde incorporates curve and circular cuts into his work much more extensively, as well as providing layers within his work.\\" Hyde's later work included a portfolio of engravings for Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1986. Hyde's career was the subject of a major retrospective at the Glenbow Museum, Calgary, in 1986, and was accompanied by a monograph, The Wood Engravings of Laurence Hyde, by the curator Patricia Ainslie. The principal collections of Hyde's work are in the Glenbow Museum, Calgary, the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and the Burnaby Art Gallery, with other important collections in the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario, and the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto. His work is also represented in the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, the Vancouver Art Gallery, The Robert McLaughlin Gallery, The Concordia Art Gallery, Montreal, and the Library of Congress. =Selected works= *Tuktu Series – *Stamp Design - 15 cents, gannet 1954; 5 cents, Alberta and Saskatchewan 50th Anniversary as provinces, 1955; 5 cents, Boy Scout World Jamboree, 1955; 5 cents fishing, 1957; 5 cents swimming, 1957; 5 cents, hunting, 1957; 5 cents, skiing, 1957; 5 cents, common loon, 1957 *Southern Cross - Laurence Hyde, Southern Cross, 1951, Ward Ritchie Press, Los Angeles.

Schoepflin; Christian Science on Trial: Religious Healing in America. Government regulators continue to attempt to find a regulatory balance.Dietary Supplement Regulation: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Public Hearing Jurisdiction differs concerning which branches of alternative medicine are legal, which are regulated, and which (if any) are provided by a government-controlled health service or reimbursed by a private health medical insurance company. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – article 34 (Specific legal obligations) of the General Comment No. 14 (2000) on The right to the highest attainable standard of health – states that Specific implementations of this article are left to member states. Two governments, acting under the laws of their respective countries, maintain websites for public information making a distinction between \\"alternative medicine\\" and \\"complementary medicine\\". In North America, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) states: :\\"...people often use the words “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: 'Complementary' generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine. 'Alternative' refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. True alternative medicine is not common. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional treatments. And the boundaries between complementary and conventional medicine overlap and change with time. For example, guided imagery and massage, both once considered complementary or alternative, are used regularly in some hospitals to help with pain management.\\" In the British Isles, the National Health Service (England)'s NHS Choices (owned by the Department of Health) states: :\\"Although 'complementary and alternative' is often used as a single category, it can be useful to make a distinction between complementary and alternative medicine. This distinction is about two different ways of using these treatments\\". \\"Treatments are sometimes used to provide an experience that is pleasant in itself. This can include use alongside conventional treatments, to help a patient cope with a health condition. When used this way the treatment is not intended as an alternative to conventional treatment. The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) says that use of treatments in this way can be called 'complementary medicine'. Treatments are sometimes used instead of conventional medicine, with the intention of treating or curing a health condition. The NCCIH says that use of treatments in this way can be called 'alternative medicine'. There can be overlap between these two categories. For example, aromatherapy may sometimes be used as a complementary treatment, and in other circumstances is used as an alternative treatment. A number of complementary and alternative treatments are typically used with the intention of treating or curing a health condition. Examples include: homeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic, herbalism.\\" United States In the United States the Food and Drug Administration's online warnings for consumers about medication health fraudFDA Medication Health Fraud includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud,FDA, Alternative Medicine Fraud such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by FDA before marketing.FDA, Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products =Texas= In the state of Texas, physicians may be partially protected from charges of unprofessional conduct or failure to practice medicine in an acceptable manner, and thus from disciplinary action, when they prescribe alternative medicine in a complementary manner, if board specific practice requirements are satisfied and the therapies utilized do not present \\"a safety risk for the patient that is unreasonably greater than the conventional treatment for the patient's medical condition.\\"Tex. Admin. Code § 200.3. Complementary and Integrative Medicine: An Update for Texas Physicians New Zealand In New Zealand, alternative medicine products are classified as food products, so there are no regulations or safety standards in place. Australia In Australia, the topic is termed as complementary medicine and the Therapeutic Goods Administration has issued various guidances and standards. Australian regulatory guidelines for complementary medicines (ARGCM) demands that the pesticides, fumigants, toxic metals, microbial toxins, radionuclides, and microbial contaminations present in herbal substances should be monitored, although the guidance does not request for the evidences of these traits. However, for the herbal substances in pharmacopoeial monographes, the detailed information should be supplied to relevant authorities The production of modern pharmaceuticals is strictly regulated to ensure that medicines contain a standardized quantity of active ingredients and are free from contamination. Alternative medicine products are not subject to the same governmental quality control standards, and consistency between doses can vary. This leads to uncertainty in the chemical content and biological activity of individual doses. This lack of oversight means that alternative health products are vulnerable to adulteration and contamination. This problem is magnified by international commerce, since different countries have different types and degrees of regulation. This can make it difficult for consumers to properly evaluate the risks and qualities of given products.

(1992). \\"Ranger Russet: A long Russet potato variety for processing and fresh market with improved quality, disease resistance, and yield\\". American Potato Journal 69:483-488 It was originally bred by Joseph J. Pavek of the USDA in Aberdeen, Idaho,Paul R. Wonning and released jointly by the USDA and the agricultural stations of Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Colorado in 1991. Ranger Russet is not under plant variety protection. It yields medium to high numbers of tubers with a short dormancy period.  Botanical Features  * The Ranger Russet plant is medium to tall in height and semi-erect with single, wavy, very prominent wings. * The stems are slightly pigmented and the non-pigmented nodes are slightly swollen. * The open, medium green leaves have weakly pigmented midribs. * Primary leaflets appear in four pairs with a narrowly ovate shape, an acuminate tip, an obtuse and symmetrical base and weakly wavy margins. Terminal leaflets also appear in four pairs with a narrowly ovate shape and an acuminate tip but the base is obtuse and asymmetrical. * Sprouts are broad with a cylindrical shape; the base is medium red-violet and strongly pubescent while the apex is weakly pigmented and moderately pubescent. * There are numerous flowers that have a medium red-violet corolla and a lemon yellow anther. The flower buds are strongly pigmented. * Tubers are long with a slightly flattened shape. * The brown russet skin has evenly distributed medium deep eyes with slightly prominent eyes. * The flesh is white. * Tubers have high specific gravity.  Agricultural Features  * This variety has a high resistance to heat necrosis, hollow heart (hollowed center of potato), Verticillium wilt, PVY, and PVX. * It has moderate resistance to early blight, common scab, leafroll, and Fusarium dry rot. * It is moderately susceptible to growth cracks. * Ranger Russet is very susceptible to late blight and root- knot nematode.  Storage  Ranger Russet has a dormancy period of approximately 100 days when stored at 45 F. This means if the potatoes are being stored to be used as seed they must be kept about 7-9 degrees cooler in order to prevent excessive sprouting and aging. Potatoes that are in storage to be used for processing can be stored in the same type of conditions that Russet Burbank can be stored at. If the potatoes are in storage for more than three months a chemical sprout inhibitor should be applied before 90th day. If the potatoes are immature or damaged fusarium dry rot can become an issue. It is also important that the storage unit is at a high humidity level to reduce the risk of pressure bruise.

He began his adult life as a clergyman of the Church of England, and served the Church for more than 20 years. His religious orientation moved from the orthodoxy of the Church of England to first Agnosticism, then Positivism, and finally Roman Catholicism. Early life Paul was born on 8 March 1928 at Whitelackington, Somerset, the eldest of ten children of the Rev. Charles Paul (18021861) and Frances Kegan Horne (18021848) of Bath, Somerset. He was educated at Eton College where he entered Dr Hawtrey's house in 1841, at 13 years of age. Paul matriculated on 29 January 1846 at age 17 and entered Exeter College, Oxford. He received his B.A. Degree three years later in 1849. Life in Holy Orders Paul was ordained deacon in Lent of 1851, and served as curate at Great Tew, in the Oxford Dioceses for 18511852. He was ordained a priest in 1852, and served as curate of Bloxham, near Banbury, Oxfordshire for six months. After serving for a while as a tutor to pupils travelling in Germany, Paul was appointed to chaplain's post in Eton. He served as a chaplain and an assistant master for 18531862. He also served as the Master in College, the housemaster of College, the oldest boarding house at Eton, which holds seventy King's Scholars. Board in Eton showing the name of the Masters in CollegeHe had not been a King's Scholar himself because although a nomination could be obtained without difficulty, College was at it lowest ebb, in comfort, morals, and number. Paul's aunt made a visit to Eton to check out the school before he was sent and reported that the worst ward in the worst hospital was preferable to Long Chamber, the dormitory for College. Given the condition of hospitals at the time this was a terrible indictment, and Paul was initially placed instead in Goodford's house.Paul notes in his autobiography. Memories (p. 62) that the decision not to place him in College was in some ways unfortunate, as the house was reformed in the year that he started at Eton. St Mary's Church, Sturminster Marshall where Paul was vicar for 12 yearsHe left teaching in Eton in 1862 and was appointed vicar to Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, a living in the gift of Eton. It was not a large living, being worth less than £300 a year. He served there for twelve years. He associated with Joseph Arch's movement on behalf of agricultural labourers in Dorset. Finding himself more and more out of sympathy with the teachings of the Church of England he abandoned his living and went to London. While he was at Sturminster Marshall he completed the requirements for his M.A. degree, and was awarded the degree in 1868. Publishing In 1877 he purchased the publishing department of the firm Henry S. King & Co. which had previously published some of his work, and for whom he had been acting as a reader. Paul renamed the firm C. Kegan Paul & Co.C. Kegan Paul & Co. - WorldCat Identities , worldcat.org. Retrieved 27 January 2019. Following his writings on William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, he was of material assistance in helping Elizabeth Robins Pennell write the first full-length biography of the latter. After a fire in 1883 and other problems, the firm was amalgamated with two other publisher, George Redway, who became a partner, and the heirs of Nicholas Trübner. The new firm, now a Limited Company titled Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co. Ltd, moved into larger premises in 1891. The firm did well until 1895, when the profits fell suddenly. Redway and Paul lost the confidence of the shareholders and were effectively forced out. Paul retired, having been badly injured in an accident some months earlier. While the board accepted Paul's resignation, he remained on good terms with the firm, and they published two more of his translations, as well as his Memories and his volume of verse. The firm was eventually merged with George Routledge in 1912. Works Paul wrote that although he had been a pretty frequent writer in periodicals and of pamphlets and prefaces, these could be ignored in his bibliography as he had collected in books all that are worth preserving. As an author he thought nine of his works as worthy of preserving: # A Translation of Faust (1873). In Memories Paul acknowledges the help provided by one of his pupils, Richard Brandt, in revising the text and preserving him from the foolish blunders made by other translators. # Life of William Godwin (1876) Paul reports that the book had a considerable success and that he had often thought of issuing a condensed volume, but that his own views had changed so much that a lot of changes and explanations would be needed in the revision. # Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft (1879) # Biographical Sketches Biographical Sketches (1883) The sketches are of: Edward Irving, John Keble, Maria Harethe wife of Augustus William Hare, Rowland Williams, Charles Kingsley, George Eliot, and John Henry Newman # The Thoughts of Blaise Pascal: Translated from the text of M. Auguste Molinier (1885) # Maria Drummond (1891) Mrs. Drummond was a friend of Paul's and he wrote the short memoir at the request of her surviving daughters, who gave him a free hand to do so. # Faith and Unfaith (1891), a collection of seven essays. Paul describes this as a collection of scattered essays such as seemed to me worth preserving and by which I should wish to be remembered . . . # En Route (1896) translated by Paul from the French novel written by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The book is the middle novel in a trilogy which are a thinly disguised account of Huysmans' own conversion to Roman Catholicism, and therefore of interest to Paul. Ill health prevented Paul from translating the final volume in the trilogy. # By the Way Side: Verses and Translations. (1899) This was a small volume (vii, 103 p. 8º), wotj a collection of verses. Howsham states that the publication of this volume and Memories by Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co. in 1899, show that Paul was still on good terms with his former firm. Paul's final book was his autobiography, Memories (1899). Family and later life He married Margaret Agnes Colville, daughter of Andrew Colville (1779–1856), businessman and administrator. Her siblings included James William Colvile, a judge in colonial India; Eden Colvile, Governor of Rupert's Land and the Hudson's Bay Company; Isabella Colville, mother of football pioneer Francis Marindin; and Georgiana Mary, Baroness Blatchford. Their son Eden Paul (1865–1944) was a socialist physician, writer and translator. Paul was badly injured in a traffic accident while cross the Hammersmith Road in 1895, and the injury left him with chronic pain for the rest of his life. The Times noted in his obituary that he went from being a clergyman of the Church of England to Agnosticism, Positivism, and finally Catholicism. He was living at 9 Avonmore Road, West Kensington, London when he died on 19 July 1902. His estate was valued at £2,897 9s. 10d. His portrait had been painted by Anna Lea Merritt and was in the possession of his daughter in 1912. Notes References  Further reading  * Howsam, Leslie.

The exchange enables eligible individuals and small businesses to purchase private health insurance coverage at federally subsidized rates. It is administered by an independent agency of the government of California. History California Governor Gavin Newsom and Chief of Staff Ann O'Leary in a public service announcement about Covered California in 2019. California was the first state in the U.S. to set up a health insurance marketplace. The California Health Benefit Exchange was created in September 2010 when then- Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Bill 1602, (the \\"California Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\\"), by Assembly Speaker John Perez, and Senate Bill 900, by State Senator Elaine Alquist, into law. Organizations such as the California Taxpayers Association and California Chamber of Commerce and Anthem Blue Cross had opposed the bills in whole or in part, but Schwarzenegger had made Obamacare in California a priority. The program was named \\"Covered California\\" in October 2012. Efforts to educate potential enrollees about Covered California began in 2013, including $37 million in grants to 48 organizations. Enrollment started on October 1, 2013; during the first month of operation, 35,364 people enrolled in health plans offered through Covered California, more than were enrolled through the website for the federal exchange (HealthCare.gov) in the same period. As of November 2013, over 360,000 people had completed applications. By the close of the first open enrollment period in April 2014, the number of people enrolled in Covered California was about 1.4 million; furthermore, another 1.1 million had signed up for Medi-Cal (California's Medicaid program, which was expanded as part of the ACA) through the Covered California web portal. In the second open enrollment period beginning in November 2014, Covered California's goal was to enroll 500,000 more people. The California Medical Association and other professional organizations pledged to work with Covered California to promote enrollments. Furthermore, the United States Department of Homeland Security and immigrant rights groups tried to assure potential applicants that any personal information disclosed to Covered California would not be shared with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. There were 474,000 potential new enrollees by the end of the second regular open enrollment period in February 2015. It was announced that a special enrollment period would be held between February 2015 and April 2015 to reduce tax penalties in 2015 for 600,000 Californians who needed to pay a tax penalty in 2014 because they were uninsured.  Coverage Basics = Coverage Levels = There are four different options. Each option will determine how much a consumer will pay. * Bronze level: On average, the health plan pays 60% of covered health-care costs; the consumer pays 40%. * Silver level: On average, the health plan pays 70% of covered health-care costs; the consumer pays 30%. * Gold level: On average, the health plan pays 80% of covered health-care costs; the consumer pays 20%. * Platinum level: On average, the health plan pays 90% of covered health-care costs; the consumer pays 10%. * Minimum coverage plan (worst case scenario): If the consumer is under 30 and cannot afford the other plans, this is another option. It covers three visits with no out-of-pocket costs and free preventative benefits. The services will cost full price until the consumer spends $8,150. At that point, the services are covered completely by the health plan. = Essential Health Benefits = Since Covered California is a part of the Affordable Care Act, there are some essential health benefits that the insurance companies must offer to consumers. This is a list of a few services: * Ambulatory services * Emergency/urgent care * Hospital care services * Maternity and newborn care * Mental health and substance abuse services * Prescription medication * Rehabilitation services * Laboratory services * Preventative and wellness care * Pediatric services = Dental Care = This is not required in the health plan. All Covered California health insurance plans provide pediatric dental care. Adults have the option of choosing supplemental dental care services in their plan. = Vision Care = This is not required in the health plan. Covered California provides vision care for children, but does not offer any for adults. However, Covered California will work with certain companies to offer vision care directly to the adults. Governance, staff, and budget Covered California is governed by a board composed of five members: the Secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency or his or her designee as a voting, ex officio member; two members appointed by the Governor; one member appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules; and one member appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly. All board members serve four-year terms. The first and current permanent Executive Director is Peter V. Lee. The current board includes CA HHS Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly, Chair, and Paul Fearer, Jerry Fleming, Dr. Sandra Hernandez, and Art Torres. The staff consists of 1,230 authorized positions in fiscal year 2014-15. Covered California receives no funding from state taxes; as of January 2014, it had received $1.1 billion in federal funds, but needed to be self-supporting by January 2015. The estimated expenditures for personnel in fiscal year 2014-15 were $108 million. It is projected that in fiscal year 2015, that Covered California will have a multimillion-dollar deficit. The fiscal year 2015-2016 was the last year that Covered California used federal establishment funds. The government extended funding for that year and gave approximately $100 million. After that year, Covered California has gradually reduced expenses to save their funds. In 2015, it proposed a budget of $332.9 million, leaving $194 million in reserve funding. The actual budget adopted was approximately $335 million. In 2016, the proposed budget was $308 million, which was $28 million less than the year before. The actual budget adopted was $320.9 million. For the fiscal year of 2017-2018, the proposed budget is $313.9 million.  Active Purchasing  Covered California is unique among ACA marketplaces in actively using its \\"active purchasing\\" negotiating power to bargain for lower premiums, standardize benefit designs, and require improvements in quality and equity. This is in contrast with many other state exchanges without \\"selective contracting\\" ability, which must offer all qualifying products offered by insurers. Of particular notice to consumers, the standardized benefits reduce complexity and consumer confusion, allow for apples-to-apples comparisons for consumers, and encourage head-to-head price competition to lower premiums. Participating insurance providers As of 2017, 11 insurance companies are participating in the individual and family exchange: *Anthem Blue Cross of California *Blue Shield of California *Chinese Community Health Plan *Health Net *Kaiser Foundation Health Plan *L.A. Care Health Plan *Molina Healthcare *Oscar Health *Sharp Health Plan *Valley Health Plan (owned by Santa Clara County) *Western Health Advantage (partnership of Dignity Health Sacramento, UC Davis Health System and NorthBay Healthcare) Impact= Uninsured Rate = As of 2015 the uninsured rate in California was 8.1 percent, a 9.1 percent decrease from the rate prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Of the 5.4 million Californians who gained health insurance coverage during this period, 1.4 million received coverage through Covered California, and 4.1 million received coverage from the expansion of Medi-Cal. The number of individuals covered through the exchange has not increased significantly from the 1.4 million who enrolled during Covered California's first open enrollment period in 2014. During later open enrollment periods, as some individuals chose plans through the exchange, others become eligible for Medi-Cal coverage or received coverage through an employer. A 2014 analysis estimated that \\"between 1.1 and 1.3 million people will be enrolled in Covered California with subsidies at any point in time\\" due to the churn rate. = Disparities in Access = As of 2017, 11 insurance companies offer plans through Covered California, however depending on the county an individual lives in, the number of insurers can vary from two to seven. A 2015 California Healthcare Foundation study found that the number of hospitals in an insurance network did not significantly affect the quality of care patients received. A study in the journal Health Affairs indicated that while hospital networks sold on the marketplace are narrower than their commercial counterparts, geographic access is similar, and the quality of care may even be better. However, a lack of healthcare provider options may weaken the leverage of insurance companies when negotiating prices, leading to higher premiums.

He attended Pretoria University from 1942 to 1946, and was awarded an MSc in 1947. After teaching for a period, he joined the staff of the National Herbarium, and was made Officer in Charge of Botanical Survey in 1959, and Assistant Director in 1963. His main contributions to botany have been publications on Ebenaceae and Gramineae, especially the genus Eragrostis. He is commemorated in Kirkia dewinteri, Aloe dewinteri, Silene dewinteri and other taxa. The Pedaliaceae genus Dewinteria is named after him, with the single curious species D. petrophila from the Kaokoveld in Namibia. His collection of some 9 500 specimens is housed in Pretoria with duplicates in several herbaria including Kew and Windhoek. They were collected between 1947 and 1975 on his own or together with Willi Giess, D. S. Hardy, O. A. Leistner, W. Marais or J. Wiss. His main collecting areas were Pretoria and northwards to Messina, Kruger National Park, Namibia, Northern Cape, Okavango, Kaokoveld, Botswana, Matopos, Caprivi Strip. Bernard de Winter together with his wife Mayda, and botanist D. J. B.

It starred Marshall Thompson and Arthur Franz. Premise American spy Mel Hunter, while on a covert mission, is shrunk to a height of six inches after an accident. This series stars Marshall Thompson as Federal Counter-Espionage Agent Mel Hunter, who uses his small size to infiltrate areas that a full-sized man could not.

Not a success, this series only lasted through its initial production order of 13 episodes. Thompson later went on to star in the (much more) successful CBS TV series Daktari (1966-1969). In popular culture Nearly a decade later, in 1968, a similarly-themed Irwin Allen TV series, entitled Land of the Giants, starring Gary Conway and Don Marshall, ran on ABC. Two years prior to that series, an animated TV show called Tom of T.H.U.M.B., aired as a part of The King Kong Show. In 1973 the Hanna-Barbera's animated series Inch High, Private Eye, about a similarly small detective, premiered on NBC, airing for only one season.

It, in turn, was part of the Chinese 640 ABMS project in the 1960s. Although the project was cancelled in March 1980, the experience gained helped China with its later ABMS development. 640 The origin of FJ ABM traces back to December 15, 1963, when Chairman Mao Zedong first initiated the idea. On February 2, 1964, the formal requirement was issued. Also in 1964, the 2nd Academy of the 7th Ministry of Machinery Industry (currently the 2nd Academy of China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation(CASIC)), also known as the Ministry of Aerospace Industry, began to work on the proposal and to establish programs at the same time. A plan outlining the missile defence weapon development submitted by the Chinese Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND) was approved in August 1965. Subsequently, the project was formally named Project 640 (640工程), because the requirement was formally issued in 1964. However, Project 640 was seriously disrupted by political turmoil in China, namely the Cultural Revolution that erupted in 1966. Further complications arose due to the complexity of the project. In August 1969, the project was reorganized into several major sections, each with its own design function. Project 640 was divided into space-borne systems, which included CK-1 (长空一号 meaning Vast Sky # 1, with CK = Chang Kong), ELINT satellite, and FW-1 (反卫一号, meaning anti-satellite # 1 with FW = Fai Wei) anti-satellite, and land-based systems. The land-based systems were further divided into five different sections, including: Project 640-5 a study on the re-entry of warheads of ballistic missiles, Project 640-4 the early warning radar, Type 640-3 a laser gun research project, Project 640-2, the ABM super gun designated as Vanguard (Xianfeng 先锋),Vanguard ABM super gun and Project 640-1, the ABM missile system along with other supporting infrastructure, the primary portion of Project 640. On August 14, 1969, Zhou Enlai reassigned the 201st Institute of the 7th Ministry of Machinery Industry as the primary contractor of Project 640-2, assisted by the 1410th Institute of the Ministry of Electronic Industry, and the 2nd Academy of 7th Ministry of Machinery Industry as the primary contractor of Project 640-1. 640-1 Project 640-1 included the construction of a hypersonic wind tunnel with a half meter diameter. Constructed in the 1960s, it is still in use today, long after the cancellation of Project 640, for later missile and satellite programs, such as JL-1 and JL-2. Project 640-1 was located in Yunnan, where one of the huge radar sites was located, and COSTIND Base # 24, located in Kunming, the provincial capital, where most research was done. The base was kept secret for decades long after the cancellation of Project 640. It was not fully declassified until the 2010s. HQ-81 HQ-81 (红旗 HQ = Hong Qi, meaning Red Flag) was the ABMS of Project 640-1, consisting of Type 715 engagement radar, FJ series missiles and other fire control systems (but not including the early warning radar). During deployment, HQ-81 system would operate with information received from satellite and radar. One of the achievements of HQ-81 is the S-7 vehicle- mounted field computer. It was used for many other Chinese missiles developed after Project 640 was cancelled, such as the DF-5. The need for such a large computer was due to the calculations needed for the FJ series missiles and its Type 715 fire control radar, as well as other information provided by sources such as Type 110 and Type 7010 radar, and the CK-1 ELINT satellite. CK-1 ELINT satellite The CK-1 (Chang-Kong Yi-hao 长空一号) ELINT satellite provided an early warning of an all-out attack by the former USSR. The primary contractor was the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, the predecessor of the current (上海电气电站设备有限公司) which newly formed a 701st Department (七零一车间) on October 31, 1969, specially for Shanghai 4101 Project—the CK-1 program. The Huayi Electronics Factory (华一电器厂), the predecessor of the current Shanghai Huayi Electronics Factory Co. Ltd (上海华一电器厂有限公司) was tasked to design the computer on board CK-1. CK-1 was designed to intercept Soviet radar and air defense network signals, and communication signals. The intelligence gathered would be downlinked to the Chinese military for analysis to detect any signs of a surprise attack. Although an attack never occurred, the intelligence gathered was nonetheless valuable, and the experience gained was used on later Chinese spy satellites. As with other Chinese military programs, CK-1 also suffered due to the Cultural Revolution. After the first two launches on September 18, 1973, and July 12, 1974, ended in failure, the following three launches using Feng Bao 1 rockets on July 26, 1975, December 16, 1975 and August 30, 1976, were successful.CK-1 satellite Type 7010 radar In addition to receiving intelligence from the CK-1 ELINT satellite, the primary early warning of the HQ-81 ABMS was the massive Type 7010 passive electronically scanned array radar. The general designer of Type 7010 radar was Mr. Shen Zhongyi (申仲义, Mar 1922 - Apr 14, 1988), who was also the general designer of another radar used by the HQ-81 ABMS, Type 110. Mr. Shen Zhongyi was the head and the general designer of the 14th Research Institute at Nanjing, and the deputy director of the 10th Academy of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China (eventually promoted to the director). Under his leadership, all radar of the HQ-81 ABMS of Project 640 were developed at the 14th Institute.Radar designer The Type 7010 passive phased array radar program began in May 1970, and installation work on the mountain above sea level began in 1972, on the northern slope of the Mongolian Gazelle Mountain in Zhuolu County. In 1974, the radar was rushed into operation even before its completion, which did not occur until 1976. It received state certification in the following year. The radar antenna array has a width of and a height of , with a total of 8,976 transceivers. The peak power is 10 gigawatts (GW), with an average power of 200 kW, and a range in excess of .Type 7010 radar Type 110 radar Another long-range tracking radar of HQ-81 ABMS of Project 640 is the Type 110 monopulse radar for long range precision tracking. Work first began in 1959 for Project 110 simulation experimental radar after the order was given in 1958. From 1965 to 1970 more research was conducted, including the incorporation of Cassegrain antenna. When the Type 110 radar finally entered service in 1977, the system weighed more than , with an antenna diameter in excess of . The radome of the Type 110 was made of fiberglass. At the time of its completion, it was the largest structure of its kind in the world, with a height of over and a diameter of over at the base.Type 110 radar The range of the Type 110 radar is in excess of . It is located in Yunnan. The Type 110 radar remains in operation today as a primary tool for space exploration. FJ-1 The FJ-1 was the most important member of the FJ series ABM. The name FJ-1 was often used to replace HQ-81. The missile was long, weighed around , and was launched at 50-degree angle. Originally adopting two-stage liquid rocket motors, it was later improved to have one solid rocket motor and one liquid motor. It takes about 20 minutes for the missile to be loaded on the launcher from the transportation truck. In February 1966, three rounds of a scaled-down version of FJ-1 for trials were completed. They were successfully tested between February 19 and February 29, 1966. As with all Chinese projects at the time, FJ-1 was seriously delayed by the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. In April 1972, production batch 01 consisting of two FJ-1s was finally completed. However, on May 15, 1972, during tests in Kunming, both rounds exploded in the sky, resulting in the test failing. Although measures were taken, it was not until August and September 1978, when the next batch were successfully tested. In the trials the warheads of both the ballistic missile and the FJ-1 were replaced by dummy warheads filled with instrumentation. Despite the successful trial, the political climate change in China spelled doom for the FJ-1, which was finally cancelled on March 9, 1980, marking the end of the entire Project 640. FJ-2 The FJ-2, the second member of the FJ missile series used in the HQ-81 ABMS began in 1970. From October 1971 to April 1974, the scaled-down model test rounds (at 1:5 ratio) of the FJ-2 completed six tests. Five resulted in success, only one ended in failure. Although begun after the FJ-1, the FJ-2 actually progressed faster. However, the some of the capability of the FJ-2 overlapped with that of the FJ-1, while the remaining overlapped that of HQ-3 and HQ-4 surface-to-air missiles. The decision was made in 1973 to cancel the FJ-2 for better efficiency and to concentrate on FJ-1 and HQ-3 and HQ-4. FJ-3 The FJ-3, the last member of FJ series missile used in HQ-81 ABMS begun development in May 1974. It was a three-stage rocket motor powered ABM launched from a silo, but it was cancelled in 1977. However, subsystems of FJ-3 were developed and used on other Chinese missile programs, such as the S-7 vehicle mounted computer, which was later used on the DF-5 ballistic missile.

Efraim Seidenbeutel and Menasze Seidenbeutel were born on December 7, 1907. They were killed in 1945, at the Flossenbürg concentration camp. They had two brothers who were also artists: Józef, the oldest, was a painter and Hirsz, the youngest, was a sculptor. Art The Seidenbeutels are considered \\"Interwar Artists\\" and painted in the Post-expressionism of École de Paris. They painted mostly landscapes and still life scenes. The twins had a unique way of working; one brother would start a painting and the other brother would finish it. They would sign the painting with just their surname. Even the works the twins created separately have an almost identical style. Biography The Seidenbeutels were born in Warsaw. Their father, Abraham, was a textile trader, and their mother took care of the eight children. Efraim's and Menasze's six siblings included Józef, the oldest, who was also a painter and Hirsz, who was younger and was a sculptor. =Education= The Seidenbeutels signed up for painting studies in 1921, at the Municipal School of Decorative Arts. In 1922, their sculpture titled “The Portrait of Anski” was shown at the 4th Exhibition of Paintings and Sculptures organized by the Jewish community. Thereafter, they became students at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, where they belonged to the elitist group \\"Four\\" set up by the Rector Tadeusz Pruszkowski. Monika Żeromska remembers that the twins enrolled in school as one student, paid one fee, and took turns attending classes. =The pre-war years= The Seidenbeutels had their own studio at the Jewish dorm on Sierakowskiego Street in the Warsaw district of Praga. Frequently, they would go on field trips to small villages and paint en plein air. One of the towns they visited frequently was Kazimierz Dolny. During the late 1920s and early 1930s they would arrive for a 'season' carrying over 24 stretched canvases each, and complete them in 30–60 days. These canvases would be exhibited in Warsaw and Krakow, and would sell out. They met with other artists and inspired younger ones, such as Chaim Goldberg. They met Goldberg when he was eleven years-old and bought his en plein air gouache; it was Goldberg's first sale. =The Holocaust Years= During World War II and the Nazi occupation, the Seidenbeutels were confined within the ghetto in Białystok where they worked at the House of Art in the army. They may have belonged to a group of painters, set up by Oskar Steffens, who copied reproductions of paintings by old masters. The twins were later sent to the Stutthof concentration camp, from which they were marched to the death camp in Flossenbürg. They were executed by the camp’s guards one day before the camp was liberated. Izaak Celnikier, also a painter, was a witness to their deaths. Their unique bond The Seidenbeutels had a unique bond that intrigues experts to the present day. One brother would start a painting while the other completed it, and the signature was their surname. They signed their paintings this way even when completing a painting individually. Their similar looks became the subject of jokes, the most popular of which is the following: List of art works ;Works executed jointly: * Portret An-skiego (1921), płaskorzeźba * Widok z okna (1930) olej na płótnie, 88×76, w zbiorach Muzeum Sztuki w ŁodziEfraim i Menasze Seidenbeutlowie 1902–1945... s. 57 * Martwa natura z kwiatami olej na sklejce 69,5×60,8, w zbiorach prywatnych * Droga do wioski (ok. 1938) * Studium kobiety z kwiatami (ok. 1930) olej na sklejce, 72,5×61, w zbiorach Muzeum Narodowego w SzczecinieMałgorzata Witek-Czyńska.

There are four types: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). F-gases are a subgroup of the halogenated gases, the majority of which are halocarbons that include fluorine, but do not include chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Types of F-gases The most common F-gases are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. They are used in a multitude of applications including commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration, air-conditioning systems, heat pump equipment, and as blowing agents for foams, fire extinguishants, aerosol propellants, and solvents. HFC-134a (1,1,1-Trifluoroethane) has grown to become the most abundant HFC in earth's atmosphere as of year 2015. Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are the compounds consisting of fluorine and carbon. They are widely used in the electronics, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in refrigeration when combined with other gases. PFCs were commonly used as fire extinguishants in the past and are still found in older fire protection systems. They are also a by-product of the aluminium smelting process. PFC-14 (Carbon tetrafluoride - CF4) has grown to become the most abundant PFC in earth's atmosphere as of year 2015. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is used primarily as an arc suppression and insulation gas. It can be found in high-voltage switchgear and is used in the production of magnesium. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is used primarily as an etchant for microelectronics fabrication. Use history HFCs were developed in the 1990s to substitute for substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). As these substances were found to deplete the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol began to lay down provisions for them to be phased-out globally after the agreement was ratified in 1987. PFCs and SF6 were already in use prior to the Montreal Protocol. NF3 use has grown since the 1990s along with the rapid expansion of the microelectronics fabrication industry. Environmental impact of F-gases Rapid growth in the atmospheric concentration of SF6, NF3, and several widely used HFCs and PFCs between years 1978 and 2015 (right graph). Note the logarithmic scale. F-gases are ozone-friendly, enable energy efficiency, and are relatively safe for use by the public due to their low levels of toxicity and flammability. However, most F-gases have a high global warming potential (GWP), and some are nearly inert to removal by chemical processes. If released, HFCs stay in the atmosphere for decades and both PFCs and SF6 can stay in the atmosphere for millennia. The total atmospheric concentration of F-gases, CFCs, and HCFCs has grown rapidly since the mid-twentieth century; a time which marks the start of their production and use at industrial scale. As a group in year 2019, these unnatural man-made gases are responsible for about one-tenth of the direct radiative forcing from all long-lived anthropogenic greenhouse gases. F-gases are used in a number of applications intended for climate change mitigation, that can generate further positive feedback for atmospheric heating. For example, refrigeration and air conditioning systems are increasingly utilized by humans within a warming environment. Likewise, expansions of electrical infrastructure, as driven by the alternatives to fossil fuels, has led to rising demand for SF6. If recent trends of aggressive (5% and greater CAGR) annual growth for such types of F-gas production were to continue into the future without complimentary reductions in GWP and/or atmospheric leakage, their warming influence could soon rival those of CO2 and CH4 which are trending at less than about 2% annual growth. Regulation of F-gases=International level= Although the Montreal Protocol regulates the phasing out of HCFCs, there was no international agreement on the regulation of HFCs until late 2016 when the Kigali Agreement under the Montreal Protocol was signed, which has put compulsory phase wise phasing out of CFC gases. Efforts are ongoing to develop a global approach for the control of HFCs. Most recently, this has taken the form of a declaration of support for a global phase-down on as part of the outcomes of the \\"Rio+20\\" United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. =US-level= In the United States, the regulation of F-gases falls under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency's overall attempts to combat greenhouse gases. The United States has put forward a joint proposal with Mexico and the Federated States of Micronesia for a phase-down of HFCs by 2030. =EU-level regulation= In order to combat the potential global warming effects of F-gases, and as part of the EU's Kyoto protocol commitments, in 2006 the European Union passed two pieces of legislation controlling their use: the F-gas Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 and the Mobile Air Conditioning Directive Directive 2006/40/EC. The F-gas Regulation adopts an approach based on containment and recovery of F-gases as well as imposing obligations on reporting, training and labeling on those using F-gases. On 26 September 2011, the Commission issued a report on the application, effects and adequacy of the Regulation, drawing from the results of an analytical study it commissioned from German environmental research institute, Öko-Recherche. A further study, conducted by the Armines Centre energétique et procédés and by Energy Research Innovation Engineering (ERIE) found that emissions reductions of up to 60% can be achieved by improving containment measures and accelerating the changeover from high GWP refrigerants to ones with lower GWP. On 7 November 2012, the European Commission published the proposal to revise the F-gas Regulation. In December 2013, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU agreed the text of the revised regulation, which shall be applied from 1 January 2015.

At the time, McCann had the industry's most comprehensive global network, with 100 offices in 64 countries. The firm chose Moreira to head this initiative in 1984.Eikenberg, Darcy (July 29, 1988). \\"Marcio Moreira: An International Flair\\". Back Stage.  The face of global advertising  When Moreira took over the InterNational team, it had been conceived as a \\"firefighting\\" unit, dedicated to helping affiliates around the world resolve problems, such as pitching new business or writing a critically needed spot for a short-handed office. Moreira enhanced the vision, approaching the initiative as an opportunity to change the \\"brown envelope syndrome\\" in global advertising, which he described as \\"when something is created in New York and sent in a brown envelope to offices overseas with instructions to translate.Rothenberg, Randall (February 27, 1989). \\"Advertising: International Approach of McCann\\" The New York Times. He was among the first to argue that much of American advertising was \\"unexportable\\". In a 1991 interview with Time, he discussed the American cultural tendency toward the \\"hard sell\\" and \\"wearing our feelings on our sleeve\\" versus other world cultures that resist overt emotional manipulation.Hornblower, Margot (July 15, 1991). \\"Advertising Spoken Here: At an International Festival of Television Commercials, the Hottest Spots Reveal a World of Cultural Differences.\\" Time. Alternately, he addressed in USA Today Americans' customary prudishness toward sexual content in advertising—despite their taste for \\"titillation in entertainment\\" - that would be incompatible with advertising in other parts of the world.Wells, Melanie and Enrico, Dottie (June 27, 1997). \\"Racy Ads Unnerve Marketers\\". USA Today. Moreira advocated for centralized strategies and concepts, but localized execution that reflects cultural nuances.Cooper, Ann (April 1990). \\"As the World Turns: Marcio Moreira Explains Why International Is Hot, Hot, Hot\\". Creativity. He often drew on the disparate ways customers around the world perceived product benefits. For example, as diet soda brands grew popular in the 80s, he explained: \\"In the American market, if you say a diet drink is to help you keep in shape, it’s like saying a car has four wheels. To be successful, you have to offer that plus tremendous taste and heritage. Overseas, you have to bring to people’s attention that the time has come to look after themselves, and here’s a soft drink that will help [them] with that.\\" Yet he reinforced the importance of creating a universal brand experience that transcends culture, even though the execution may require nuanced expression. He described this careful balance using the simultaneous Coca-Cola campaigns \\"You Can’t Beat the Feeling\\" and \\"I Feel Coke\\" that ran in the U.S. and Japan, respectively: \\"Japan is probably the one country whose ads would strike you as having the most unique look due to the cultural and ethnic orientation of the advertising. If you forgot for a minute that those faces were Japanese faces, those people live in a Coca-Cola world. The sounds, words and images are actually quite similar to those you see here or in the U.K. or in Australia... They’re different interpretations of the same idea.\\" Moreira ultimately held McCann posts in eight nations and insisted that team members have on-the-ground experience in the countries where they were helping develop and execute campaigns. He encouraged art directors, writers and producers involved in InterNational Team business to accept long-term overseas career opportunities rather than simply periodic travel. He also maintained that these opportunities needed to be symbiotic throughout the McCann network and not merely involve placement of experts from the New York headquarters around the globe: \\"I don’t mean one-way streets, like Americans or Brits going to see the world; I see a two-way street in which other nationalities will come into these cultures and energize them in their own way.\\" Moreira became an active spokesperson of the new global approach to marketing. He was often pursued for commentary by major business reporters and regularly published opinion pieces in relevant media. When Advertising Age ran a feature on global marketing as \\"the new wave\\", an American executive objected to the decision-making authority vested in \\"some marketing director in Chile [who] is probably a bozo\\".\\"Global marketing: The new wave\\". Advertising Age. (June 25, 1984.) Moreira wrote a scathing response detailing the new realities of multi-cultural marketing and explaining, \\"That ‘bozo’ is the global agency's real client\\", responsible not only for strategy but to profits, given that global work is paid for locally.Moreira, Marcio (July 23, 1984). \\"Who’s a ‘bozo’?\\" Advertising Age. In 1989, Moreira was promoted to Vice Chairman/Chief Creative Officer, International, and later named Chief Creative Officer, McCann Worldgroup.Wentz, Laurel (June 11, 2001). \\"The Ghost Ads of Cannes\\". Advertising Age.  Asia-pacific years  In the mid-90s, McCann Worldwide focused on the Far East, given the re-emergence of China as an economic leader, the rise of the middle class in such markets as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, and the region's new sensitivity about cultural values in advertising. McCann named Moreira regional director. He oversaw strategic as well as creative development and helped revitalize McCann's Asia Pacific presence. He also transitioned the McCann Hong Kong office during the British handover to China, and assumed direct management of McCann Tokyo, the firm's largest international office. Likewise, he played a critical role in securing the flagship Coca-Cola account in what had become a highly competitive region.Kilburn, David (April 17, 1995). \\"Asian Global Quarterly: A New Asian Vision for McCann\\". Adweek.  Later career  In 2000, Moreira was named McCann's Vice Chairman, Global Professional Management of McCann Worldgroup responsible for all personnel handling global accounts - in addition to his international creative role. In 2003, he took his final role as Vice Chairman, Chief Talent Officer and Worldwide HR Director, responsible for worldwide recruitment and career development of thousands of employees. In recognition of Moreira's defining role in global marketing, Deutsche Bank featured him in its 2001 campaign \\"New Destinations Call for New Maps\\" that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and a full range of international business publications.Deutsche Bank Advertisement (April 4, 2001). The Wall Street Journal, p. A9. Among his major industry awards, Moreira had won a Gold Lion for Coca-Cola, a Silver Lion for Bayer, three Clio Awards for Chevrolet and another for \\"Coke Is It!\\" He had been one of only three Americans to chair the International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes, France.Rothenberg, Randall (June 23, 1989). \\"Advertising: Film Festival Leader\\".

Imprinting is generally defined as a process whereby, during a brief period of susceptibility, a focal entity or actor (such as an industry, organization, or an individual) develops characteristics that reflect prominent features of the environment, and these characteristics continue to persist despite significant environmental changes in subsequent periods. This definition emphasizes three key elements of imprinting: # brief sensitive periods of transition during which the focal entity exhibits high susceptibility to external influences; # a process whereby the focal entity comes to reflect elements of its environment during a sensitive period; and # the persistence of imprints despite subsequent environmental changes. Organizational research on imprinting The use of the imprinting concept (although not the term itself) in organizational theory dates back to Arthur Stinchcombe’s 1965 paper entitled \\"Social Structure and Organizations.\\" This essay focused on understanding why organizations and industries that were founded in the same period were so similar even today. According to this essay, external environmental forces powerfully shaped firms’ initial structures during the founding period, and these structures persisted in the long run, well beyond the time of founding. For example, as most university fraternities emerged in three different waves, their current organizational features still reflect the imprint of one of these three periods. The first wave of foundings reflected the secularization of Northern liberal arts colleges in the 1840s; the second wave began in the South in the latter half of the 1860s; and the third wave came between 1900 and 1920, when marginalized populations of Black, Catholic, and Jewish students established fraternities emphasizing anti-discrimination goals. In subsequent periods, each of these three different types carried the legacy of their founding environment. Event though Stinchcombe did not specifically use the term \\"imprinting,\\" the term soon became associated with his essay. Stinchcombe’s primary focus was at the industry level, but most subsequent studies have examined how individual organizations bear a lasting imprint of founding conditions. For instance, in a series of studies on Silicon Valley high-tech start-ups, scholars have measured founders’ mental models and initial decisions and then tracked how these founding conditions influenced subsequent organizational trajectories. The results suggest that the organizational patterns set by a founder have persistent effects on a wide array of outcomes even after the founder leaves the firm. Imprinting at other levels of analysis Even though the organization has been the dominant level of analysis in much of the literature building on the imprinting concept, recent years have also seen the emergence of imprinting research at the other levels analysis as well. For example, scholars have used the concept of imprinting to examine how and why organizational building blocks—such as jobs and routines—continue to reflect the circumstances of their creation. At the individual level, researchers have explored how early career experiences exert a lasting effect on people’s careers or job titles (a process known as career imprinting or position imprints, respectively). For example, experiences in a particular type of (munificent or scarce) resource environment early in one's career or organizational tenure might influence subsequent work styles and job performance. In this line of research, the concept of imprint-environment fit highlights that the same imprint may be beneficial for performance in some environments and detrimental in others.

A second palace by the same name was built nearby, and is still standing. History The palace of the noble Bolognese family of Bentivoglio was built on the orders of Sante Bentivoglio, in Via San Donato (today Via Zamboni), starting in 1460, and was subsequently completed by Giovanni II Bentivoglio. Contemporary chroniclers and scholars have attempted to reconstruct the appearance of the great house on the basis of often enthusiastic descriptions. The main facade facing onto Via San Donato measured 30 meters, while the sides were over 140 meters in length. Located on the ground floor were the apartments of the men of the house of Bentivoglio, while the upper floor held the apartment of Giovanni II, richly frescoed, and the equally sumptuous apartment of Ginevra Sforza and the other women of the house. The building also housed guards and soldiers and included guest rooms, warehouses and depots of arms. The building had 244 rooms in total. In it, the Bentivoglio received illustrious visitors and friends, and gave sumptuous dinners and parties. Destruction The building was destroyed by popular fury in the spring of 1507. The decision to destroy it was made by the enemies of the Bentivoglio, who had come to see their rule of Bologna as tyrannous and had co-operated with Pope Julius II to bring about their expulsion from the city in late 1506. The city's new rulers were convinced that it was necessary to raze the house of tyrants if you wanted to prevent their return, and the Senate accordingly decreed that any emblem or sign of the Bentivoglios' past domination must be destroyed. The destruction of the palace in Via San Donato was, however, a great loss for the history of Italian art. Today the area where the palace stood is occupied by the Teatro Comunale, adjacent to Via del Guasto (\\"Ruin Road\\"), whose name recalls the fate of the Bentivoglio palace. The modern Giardino del Guasto, a small public garden created in 1975 by the architect Rino Filippini, covers the area formerly occupied by the garden of the palace. Later developments A little further on, in Via Delle Belle Arti, stands the imposing new Palazzo Bentivoglio. It was built, starting in 1551, by Costanzo Bentivoglio, a descendant of a collateral branch (non- dominant) of the family. The architect Bartolomeo Triachini is attributed with the design of the majestic and beautiful later palace. The entrance leads into a spacious courtyard surrounded by a double loggia that was based on designs by Domenico Tibaldi. It was completed by Giovanni Battista Falcetti in the first half of the seventeenth century. The upper floor of the new palace has a number of halls that have ceilings and friezes from the Tibaldi school. There is a large gallery painted by in chiaroscuro style Antonio Bonetti with sculptures by Ubaldo Gandolfi. The gallery was opened in 1769 when senator Fulvio Bentivoglio became Gonfaloniere of Bologna.

Many animals, especially wild birds and mammals, are wary of humans, and flee from their presence while still at a distance that would not normally allow a quality photograph to be obtained. Hide photography=Aims of hide photography= The aim of hide photography is to allow the photographer to be in close proximity to the wild animal without alarming and making it flee, and thereby obtain photographs of the species in non-captive conditions. A good hide setup will enable the occupying photographer to take a large number of photos, without apparently affecting the wild animal's behavior, and to observe and graphically document natural or near-natural behavior in natural or near-natural surroundings. =Types of hide= Hides come in many shapes and sizes, which effectively depend on certain factors, such as fabrication costs, the materials or know-how available for their construction, the function required of them, the setting in which they are to be used, the prevailing environmental conditions, the behavior of the target animals, etc. One of the simplest hides is a screen or camouflage netting covering a hollow space in a bush or between rocks, for example. Then there are so-called \\"pop- up\\" hides, which can be purchased ready made, as well as tents, or variations on this theme which can be fabricated and mounted with relative ease by the user. Larger hides can be made of stone, concrete blocks, bricks and mortar or wood. They can also be made by recycling things made originally for other functions such as the so-called \\"rubbish hide\\", the first commercial hide offered in Catalonia by Birding In Spain, made from a plastic rubbish container which was inverted, equipped with a one-way glass front and an entrance door. Other hides can be equipped with \\"sleeves\\" to minimize visible movement of camera lenses; tower hides have been erected to enable photography of birds in trees and on roofs; floating hides or raft hides are sometimes used to get closer to birds and other wildlife in freshwater habitats. =Commercial hides= With the advances in digital photography, commercial hide photography has become a reality and a growing phenomenon within the tourism and ecotourism sectors. More and more wildlife enthusiasts consider participating in organized wildlife or bird photo trips, where it is possible to use one or more commercially managed hides to obtain photos of attractive or emblematic species, which may be difficult or almost impossible to obtain otherwise. Currently, the main European countries with the greatest offer of commercial hides are Hungary, Finland, Bulgaria and Spain. The species that can usually be photographed from such hides include bears, wolves, wolverines, as well as eagles, bultures, owls, etc. In Spain, the main species which can be photographed from commercial hides on a bird photo trip include lammergeier, little bustard, great bustard, Bonelli's eagle, griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, black vulture, red kite, golden eagle, lesser kestrel, little owl and a number of plains birds. =Hide protocol= Depending on the species or site, it may be necessary for the photographer to occupy the hide before dawn and to leave it after sunset. This is the case with some species and in places where the photographer's approach and entrance to the hide cannot be disguised. With other hides it is possible for the photographer to be accompanied to the hide by a person who then leaves the site, leading the birds or mammals into the belief that there are no longer any humans in the vicinity.
